The MeeGo Project has had multiple releases and has progressed
significantly since its announcement in February 2010.
This article provides an overview
of the MeeGo Project for newcomers, a review of the benefits 
MeeGo provides to the players in the mobile ecosystem, and discusses
the features in the latest MeeGo 1.1 release, announced October
28, 2010.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22dc580.0x23d4460"></a>
Introduction to MeeGo</h2></div></div><p>
MeeGo is an open, collaborative project between the project founders
(Nokia and Intel), the Open Source community and various commercial and
noncommercial partners with the goals of accelerating the adoption of
Linux on a magnitude of client devices and enriching the technical Linux
platform as the platform of choice for mobile computing devices.
</p><p>
MeeGo is a Linux-based operating system built for the next generation
of computing devices across multiple hardware architectures. Different
from other mobile operating systems, MeeGo is an open-source platform
governed by best practices of open-source development. It includes the
following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Core operating system.
</p></li><li><p>
User Interface (UI) libraries and tools.
</p></li><li><p>
References user experiences for multiple devices.
</p></li><li><p>
Standard set of application programming interfaces (APIs) across all target
device types.
</p></li><li><p>
A software development kit (SDK) that enables application developers to
develop, install, debug and run applications either on reference
devices or in an emulated environment.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
MeeGo supports a magnitude of mobile client devices (handsets,
connected TVs, in-vehicle infotainment, Netbooks and tablets). It provides
choice and flexibility to create and deliver a uniquely differentiated
service offering. It's an unusual project in that it is aligned
closely with upstream projects, as MeeGo requires that submitted patches
also are submitted to the appropriate upstream project and are on a path
for acceptance. This development model has the great effect of improving
all upstream open-source projects used in MeeGo, and it guarantees a unified
technical approach led by the upstream projects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22dc580.0x23d49e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
MeeGo and Connected Devices</b></p><p>
We all use mobile devices every day (such as Netbooks, connected TVs,
tablets,
in-vehicle infotainment and handsets). The power of these devices has reached
astounding levels with unheard of performance and capabilities. The goal of
the MeeGo Project is to develop the best software platform to go with these
devices.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22dc580.0x23d4bf0"></a>
How Does MeeGo Benefit the Mobile Ecosystem?</h2></div></div><p>
If you are an open-source developer, you will enjoy working on an
open-source mobile platform project that follows open-source development
practices. You will have full access to everything MeeGo, and you can rest
assured that any code contributed by MeeGo will be submitted to the
appropriate upstream open-source projects. From this perspective, every
other Linux mobile and desktop effort will benefit from MeeGo's work
and contributions.
</p><p>
If you are an application developer, you will enjoy working with a
single set of APIs across a number of client devices (handsets, tablets,
Netbooks, in-vehicle infotainment systems and connected TVs). You have
access to polished and easy-to-get-and-use developer tools and
infrastructure. In addition, there are open forums where you can engage in
discussions directly with the platform and tool creators, exchange
ideas and best practices and even participate in the evolution of the
platform. Plus, you will enjoy the flexibility of hosting your
applications in more than one application store.
</p><p>
If you are a device manufacturer or a wireless operator looking to
build and/or deploy devices with MeeGo, the project offers tremendous
opportunities. MeeGo is a democratic project with open access to all,
at all times. It is the only platform of its kind built with unparalleled
openness in the industry. It will accelerate your time to market, lower
the complexities involved in targeting multiple device types, allow
you to optimize the software stack and, most important, grant you an
equal right to participate in the evolution of the software platform.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22dc580.0x23d4da8"></a>
MeeGo 2010 Milestones</h2></div></div><p>
Since the project announcement in February 2010, MeeGo
has delivered the core software platform in addition to three user
experience implementations (Netbook, handset and in-vehicle infotainment),
with several updates in between. Figure 1 provides the roadmap
of releases since the project's inception and Figure 2 offers the roadmap of
the release updates and what they included.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10935f1.large.jpg"><img src="10935f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MeeGo Releases Since the Project's Announcement
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10935f2.large.jpg"><img src="10935f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MeeGo Release Updates
</p></div></div><p>
Between major releases, MeeGo offers updates that usually include
general operating system fixes to enhance the stability, compatibility,
security and visual quality of the devices running MeeGo. Between
MeeGo 1.0 (05/2010) and MeeGo 1.1 (10/2010), the MeeGo Project provided
three update releases that featured improvements to the MeeGo
core stack and the Netbook release.
</p><p>
The releases follow the six-month cycle promised by the project and are being
delivered on time.
The MeeGo source code repository is open for people to pull the source code
anytime they like, if they don't want to be restricted to the six-month
release cycle.
The release updates are available as necessary, depending on the
security/stability/compatibility updates. However, you don't need to wait
for the official update to become available, because you have access to the code
repository, and you can create an updated image from scratch for your target
device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22dc580.0x23d52d0"></a>
What's New in MeeGo 1.1?</h2></div></div><p>
Any device that will run MeeGo needs two things: the MeeGo core software
stack and the MeeGo User eXperience (UX) for that specific device,
although you are not limited to using the MeeGo UX, and you can create and
deploy your own branded UX. Currently, MeeGo is available for Netbooks,
IVI and handsets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22dc580.0x23d5430"></a>
MeeGo v1.1 Core Software Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The MeeGo Core 1.1 release provides a common base operating system for
the user experiences of all supported device categories. It provides a
complete set of enabling technologies for mobile computing. The MeeGo
stack contains Linux kernel 2.6.35, X.org server 1.9.0, Web Runtime, Qt
4.7 and Qt Mobility 1.0.2, supporting the contacts, location, messaging,
multimedia, and sensor and service frameworks. It also includes a number
of leading-edge components, such as the oFono telephony stack, the ConnMan
connection manager, the Tracker data indexer, the Telepathy real-time
communications framework, the Buteo sync framework and many more.
</p><p>
These technologies are brought to application developers through the
MeeGo API, which is based on Qt and other technologies, such as the
MeeGo Touch Framework. With the latest Qt version 4.7, the
MeeGo developer experience is now enhanced with the introduction of QML,
the easy-to-use scripting technology for animated touch-enabled GUI
apps.

MeeGo v1.1 IVI UX</h2></div></div><p>
In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems are devices that deliver navigation,
entertainment and networked computing services in vehicles, such as cars,
trucks, planes, boats and buses.
</p><p>
Automotive manufacturers in particular are increasingly viewing IVI
systems as key differentiators in their products. Drivers and passengers
are coming to expect the same type of innovations they see in other
devices, such as mobile computers and handsets, in their vehicles. As
vehicles become connected to the Internet, the demand for Internet-based
entertainment applications and services increases, and MeeGo strives
to accelerate the pace of innovation in IVI. The MeeGo IVI software
platform is designed to enable rich Internet and multimedia consumer
experiences for vehicles. Table 2 provides a quick overview of the key

MeeGo v1.1 Handsets UX</h2></div></div><p>
Today's users are demanding more powerful and feature-rich devices to take
with them on the go. Next-generation smartphones allow users to enjoy a
rich and dynamic Internet experience, watch HD movies and multitask like
never before on a small-form-factor device. The MeeGo platform is
specifically designed to enable the application and services ecosystem for
these mobile, rich Internet and media-centric devices.
</p><p>
The MeeGo v1.1 Handsets UX (Figure 10) provides a technology snapshot that
offers key handset technologies, such as cellular, connectivity, sensors
and mobile browsing, as well as a basic development UX for voice calling,
SMS messaging, Web browsing, music and video playback, photo viewing and

MeeGo SDK 1.1 Beta</h2></div></div><p>
The MeeGo SDK 1.1 beta was released on November 10, 2010, and it's
available for download along instructions from <a href="http://meego.com/developers" target="_self">meego.com/developers</a>. It
enables application developers to develop, install and debug applications,
as well as run applications on the Nokia N900, Netbook and Aava devices
with MeeGo. For developers without reference hardware, QEMU (<a href="http://qemu.org" target="_self">qemu.org</a>)
provides an emulated environment for debugging and testing applications.
</p><p>
The MeeGo Project encourages developers to use the MeeGo API, which
currently consists of Qt 4.7 and Qt Mobility 1.0. The MeeGo API comes with a
forward-compatibility promise and will be extended in future releases. The
final nonbeta version of the SDK will be aligned with the MeeGo compliance
specification (being finalized at the time of this writing).
More information on MeeGo compliance is available at <a href="http://wiki.meego.com/Quality/Compliance" target="_self">wiki.meego.com/Quality/Compliance</a>.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
MeeGo is an open-source project developed in public under the auspices of
the Linux Foundation. Since it was announced in February 2010, the world
has been able to watch and participate as the project builds up and
delivers the core software stack in addition to three reference user
experiences for handsets, IVI systems and Netbooks, with more to come as
MeeGo also targets connected TVs and tablets.
</p><p>
The development continues following a six-month release schedule.
MeeGo 1.2 is scheduled for April 2011. Currently, there are hundreds of
features targeting MeeGo 1.2 that already have been filed in the MeeGo
Featurezilla (a tool that tracks feature development). The development
tree of MeeGo 1.2 is open, and development is ongoing.
