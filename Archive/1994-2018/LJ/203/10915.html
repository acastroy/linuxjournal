Bluetooth is a complex beast, and recent changes
to the standard Linux implementation have
bamboozled many users. Untangle your personal
area network with this revealing article on setting
up the Bluetooth PAN Profile in BlueZ v.4.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x129d250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Bluetooth has been around for a while now (it originally was conceived
in 1994 by Ericsson as a replacement for RS-232), and many of us have
been enjoying the benefits of wirelessly connecting mice, keyboards,
headphones, mobile phones, printers, PDAs and other devices over short
distances.
</p><p>
Under Linux, these benefits are provided by one of two Bluetooth
implementations: BlueZ and Affix. The former has become the accepted
standard provided by most of the popular distributions and is the one
I discuss here.
</p><p>
In BlueZ releases prior to version 4, the various Bluetooth services
(called profiles) are implemented in separate d&aelig;mons, each with its
own configuration. The PAN profile, providing personal area networking
services, is implemented in the pand d&aelig;mon, dial-up networking
in the dund d&aelig;mon, service discovery in the sdpd d&aelig;mon
and so on. In BlueZ v.4, all of these are incorporated into one server
process called bluetoothd. This change has led to a certain
amount of confusion among users, so the aim of this article is to try
to clarify the situation somewhat by looking at the way the PAN profile
works in BlueZ v.4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x129d4b8"></a>
PAN Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The PAN profile provides three ways of connecting Bluetooth devices in
a network capable of carrying general-purpose protocols and services
over TCP/IP. Such networks are known as piconets, because they are
limited to a maximum of seven nodes and the short distances covered by
Bluetooth transmissions (up to ten meters). These are PANU, Group Ad
Hoc Network (GN) and Network Access Point (NAP) configurations. The
PANU&lt;---&gt;PANU network is the wireless analogue of a Ethernet crossover
cable between two computers. The PANU&lt;---&gt;GN network operates just like
a Wi-Fi ad hoc setup where one node acts as the master node connecting up
to six client nodes in an isolated private network and the PANU&lt;---&gt;NAP
provides network infrastructure connectivity in the same way that a 802.11
Wi-Fi access point does for Wi-Fi clients. The NAP can serve six client
nodes in the same manner as the GN master but also connects them to an
existing network infrastructure. The NAP service is the most useful of
the three connection patterns and subsumes the other two. So, if you can
get NAP working, it is relatively straightforward to achieve the other
configurations by omitting certain steps in the NAP setup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x129d5c0"></a>
Time for a NAP</h2></div></div><p>
The Bluetooth d&aelig;mon loads all the required kernel modules (the lsmod
command should show bluetooth, rfcomm, btusb, llc, sco, bridge,
bnep, stp and l2cap running) and creates a bridge-host interface called
pan0. The bnep protocol provides Ethernet services over the
Bluetooth l2cap connection and a separate bnep interface
is created on demand for each remote device that connects (bnep0,
bnep1...bnepN). bnep interfaces automatically are bridged to the
pan0 interface that serves as an IP proxy for them. Thus, only the
pan0 interface requires IP configuration. Once you have paired a
remote Bluetooth device with the Linux box and discovered the BlueZ NAP
service and connected/authenticated to it, all that remains is to provide
IP configuration for the connected devices and the required infrastructure
network connectivity. This is the part that has bamboozled many a keen
BlueZman. Here, I consider two solutions: a bridged setup
and a routed setup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x129d720"></a>
Take It to the Bridge</h2></div></div><p>
In many ways, the bridged solution is the simpler of the two. There are
fewer steps involved, and it means that your NAP and your remote Bluetooth
devices become part of your existing IP network/subnet. However, if
you don't have an existing private network/subnet because your Linux
box connects straight to your ISP (say via an Ethernet cable to an ADSL
router) or your Linux box connects to your existing private network/subnet
via an 802.11 Wi-Fi connection, the routed solution is the only way
to go. You need a private IP subnet from which to allocate addresses to
your remote BT devices, but you can't bridge to this via a wlan0
(802.11 Wi-Fi) interface because layer 2 of the wireless device is not
available to the kernel bridging facilities. Without a bridge, you will
require a separate IP network/subnet, routing and routing information,
but luckily, this is not too hard to arrange. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x129d828"></a>
The Bridged Solution</h2></div></div><p>
Let's assume you have BlueZ 4 installed. If not, use your
distribution's installation software to install it. You will need
version 4 of the BlueZ and BlueZ-libs packages. The BlueZ kernel
modules are incorporated into the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. Another useful tool
is provided by the gnome-bluetooth package in the form of a BT
panel applet that allows control from the desktop, allowing you to pair
devices and set service discovery. KDE provides a similar tool,
kbluetooth. Start the Bluetooth d&aelig;mon in the normal way, and execute
the bluetooth-applet from a shell. Enable Service Discovery in the
bluetooth-applet, and introduce a remote BT device into range. You now should
be able to discover the BlueZ-NAP service from the remote device.
If you are not using the GNOME or KDE desktop, device pairing and
service discovery are available through the hciconfig and 
hcitool utilities that are part of the BlueZ package.
</p><p>
If you are following this solution, I will assume you
have a single ISP-assigned, routable IP address that provides your
Internet connectivity (Figure 1). Your local private network (say
192.168.0.0/24) uses Network Address Translation (NAT) provided by your
router to access the Internet through your ISP connection, and the Linux
box on which you want the BT connectivity connects to the private network
via an eth0 interface to an Ethernet switch. All that being true,
you are only three steps away from your bridged NAP solution:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Make your eth0 interface part of the pan0 bridge.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure the pan0 interface for IP.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide IP configuration for remote BT devices.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You can achieve step one by use of the brctl command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
brctl show (display any extant bridges - should show pan0)
brctl add pan0 eth0 (add the eth0 interface to the pan0 bridge)
brctl showmacs pan0 (show which interfaces are bridged)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can use ifconfig to achieve step 1 temporarily:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig pan0 192.168.0.123 netmask 255.255.255.0 
 &#8618;broadcast 192.168.0.255 up
</pre>
</p><p>
Use your distribution's network management tools to create a permanent 
configuration, and choose IP values to suit your own private network topology.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10915f1.large.jpg"><img src="10915f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Bridged NAP Solution
</p></div></div><p>
The neatest solution for step three is to run a small DHCP service. If
you already run DHCP for your own private network, you just have
to make sure that the configuration covers any remote BT devices you
might connect in addition to the clients already connected. The 
pan0 interface also can get its IP configuration in this way. If you
don't already run DHCP, now could be a good time to start! It isn't
difficult to set up a simple service, and it reduces the amount of general,
routine manual configuration.
</p><p>
Below is a simple dhcpd.conf file sufficient to serve our PAN:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# small DHCP config for bluetooth PAN
ddns-update-style none;
authoritative;

subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.100;
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
option domain-name "bluetooth.net";
option routers 192.168.0.1;
option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

host btmobile {
hardware ethernet 74:e7:71:ac:d0:34;
fixed-address 192.168.0.9;
}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >subnet</tt> declaration should correspond to your local private network
topology. The <tt  >range</tt> declaration specifies a pool of IP addresses that
can be assigned dynamically. The <tt  >options</tt> specify DNS servers (this
could be your ISP's nameservers), default gateway (the NAT router) and
other common IP parameters. The <tt  >host</tt> declaration allows you to assign
fixed IP addresses to known (by MAC address) devices. Place this file
where your DHCP server expects to find it, and start the server by the
method appropriate to your distribution.
</p><p>
Needless to say, your remote BT devices and the pan0 interface should
be configured to get their IP configuration via DHCP. Once all
this is in place, your NAP should be active a few seconds after you
connect/authenticate your BT device to the Linux box.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x129e328"></a>
The Route of the Problem</h2></div></div><p>
For the routed solution, you need to create a separate network/subnet
for your PAN and route packets between this and the existing private
network/ISP-connected machine. In this configuration pan0 will
be the default gateway device and also provide the DHCP service for
the PAN. Thus, pan0 will require a static IP configuration and
its DHCP service will be separate from any other DHCP and dedicated
to the PAN. For clarity, let's use the 10.0.0.0/24 private IP network
range for this purpose. This time, there are four steps to get your routed
PAN up and running:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Configure pan0 with static IP information.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure and run DHCP for the PAN.
</p></li><li><p>
Turn on IP forwarding to route packets between pan0 and wlan0/eth0.
</p></li><li><p>
Enable NAT on the wlan0/eth0 interface.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Then:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig pan0 10.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 
 &#8618;broadcast 10.0.0.255 up
</pre>
</p><p>
Use your system tools to make permanent settings.
</p><p>
Below is a small DHCP configuration for the routed PAN:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# small dhcp config for bluetooth PAN
ddns-update-style none;
authoritative;

subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.100;
option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1;
option domain-name "bluetooth.net";
option routers 10.0.0.1;
option broadcast-address 10.0.0.255;
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

host btmobile {
hardware ethernet 78:e7:d1:ab:d5:6f;
fixed-address  10.0.0.5;
}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Alter the DNS information as necessary.
</p><p>
pan0 should be configured and up and running before you start the
DHCP service. The next step involves enabling IP forwarding so that
packets are routed between
pan0 and your existing interface (wlan0/eth0).
</p><p>
In older systems, IP forwarding is enabled by echoing a value of
&ldquo;1&rdquo; into
the appropriate system file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre>
</p><p>
In more recent systems, this is achieved by editing /etc/sysctl.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Controls IP packet forwarding
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</pre>
</p><p>
The setting also may be available in your distribution's firewall
configuration GUI tool. If none of these methods work on your system,
consult your distribution's documentation.
</p><p>
Finally, you need to tell the kernel netfilter software
to &ldquo;masquerade&rdquo; (NAT) PAN packets through the wlan0/eth0
interface. You may be able to do this using your distribution's firewall
configuration GUI tool (the IP forwarding setting may be available
here too). If not, it can be achieved using the iptables command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
</pre>
</p><p>
Substitute <tt  >eth0</tt> for <tt  >wlan0</tt> if you are using the routing
option because your Linux box connects directly to your ISP and your eth0
interface has an ISP-assigned, routable IP address (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10915f2.large.jpg"><img src="10915f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Routed NAP Solution
</p></div></div><p>
If all has gone well up to this point, your NAP service should be active
a few seconds after you connect/authenticate your remote BT device. You
should, for example, be able to ping the device from your Linux
box. If IP is not yet running, you can use <tt  >l2ping
&lt;MAC-ADDRESS&gt;</tt>
to ping the remote device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x16972e0"></a>
Oh, for the Simple Life</h2></div></div><p>
BlueZ v.4 does not appear to provide separate configurations for GN
and PANU modes of PAN operation, but this is of no consequence because, as
was noted above, these are subsumed by the NAP mode. If you only want to
connect remote BT devices to your Linux box, and do not require access to
the local network or Internet, you simply can omit step 1 from the
bridged solution and either employ the DHCP configuration from
the routed solution or manually set IP parameters for
pan0 and your BT devices.
</p><p>
In fact, Bluetooth is supposed to implement the draft
Link-local Autoconfiguration Protocol (variously known elsewhere as
Avahi, Bonjour, Rendezvouz and APIPA), so you could try using
this for IP configuration instead of running a DHCP service. However,
I had no joy with this approach under BlueZ v.4, so I leave it as
a potential solution for those of an experimental nature. I would be
happy to hear that this facility is alive and well in the BlueZ package
if anyone succeeds where I have failed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x1697498"></a>
Nostalgia Is Not What It Used to Be</h2></div></div><p>
For those who want to retain the old ways of configuring and running
the Bluetooth facilities, the development team has provided a legacy
implementation in the form of a package that contains the separate
d&aelig;mons as provided in BlueZ 3.x. This package is called
Bluez-compat and should satisfy the change-resistant among you. Michael
Schmidt (see Resources) has produced a useful how-to document covering
the legacy formats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11a5580.0x16975a0"></a>
What's Up Doc?</h2></div></div><p>
I am always very reluctant to criticize developers of free and open
software. It is all too easy to forget or take for granted the enormous
amount of dedicated work that goes into projects like BlueZ and to moan
and gripe over minor bugs and missing features. On the whole, I have
nothing but admiration for these wonderful people. But, if I could just
gently and humbly raise one point, it would be that the documentation for
BlueZ seems very thin on the ground. In fact, that's what motivated
me to write this article in the first place (for example, there is no
man page for the /etc/bluetooth/main.conf file). Anyway,
let's hope this is a temporary glitch in an otherwise unblemished
record of developmental excellence.
