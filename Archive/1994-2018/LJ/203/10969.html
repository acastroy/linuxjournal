<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #203, March 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>John Stultz</b></span> submitted code to enhance the
<span   class="bold"><b>real-time clock</b></span>. He didn't
like the fact that if a process wanted to set an alarm, it would have
to take a lock on the RTC and poll it, waiting for that alarm to go
off. His new code created an intermediate layer that would keep track
of alarms set by any user code and feed the alarms back to the
programs that had set them, as they occurred. If his patch is
accepted, it could be good news for user programs that no longer
will have to deal with the complexities of holding and freeing an RTC lock.
</p><p>
John also noticed that the <span   class="bold"><b>Android RTC alarm
driver</b></span> had a new approach
to the RTC that he felt deserved to be included in the main kernel
tree. But, because the Android driver depended on other parts of the
Android system that were not included in the official kernel, John
rewrote the driver to use native kernel interfaces and submitted it
that way. The basic value of the Android driver, as he saw it, was
that it gave the user a simpler interface, at the cost of losing some
subtle abilities that didn't seem very useful anyway. So as far as
John could see, it was a pure win. It'll be interesting to see whether
the Android system adapts to use John's version of the driver as well,
or whether it will continue to maintain its own version independently.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Vernon Mauery</b></span> submitted code to support
<span   class="bold"><b>IBM Premium Real-Time Mode</b></span>
(PRTM) on supporting x86 hardware. This powerful operating mode can
give user programs a wholesale control over the system's hardware,
which normally is tightly regulated and secured by the kernel. PRTM has
the potential to be a devastating security hole, but it also
can provide very low latency action to applications that require real-time
performance. And, it can provide very useful features to debuggers and
other meta-applications. Vernon's code provides a SysFS interface to
enter and leave PRTM at will. I'm guessing there also will be security
features to prevent applications from doing this unless they are
absolutely trusted.
</p><p>
Documentation is always nice to see, and <span   class="bold"><b>Andres
Salomon</b></span> recently submitted
some for the <span   class="bold"><b>staging tree</b></span>. The staging tree exists in the main kernel
source, under drivers/staging, and it acts as a repository for incomplete
drivers that aren't ready to be relied on completely. In the old days,
people wanting to test these drivers would have to download the
driver's patch independently, apply it to their own copy of the
kernel, and compile and install that kernel. This barrier to entry was
sufficient to keep all but the most enthusiastic testers from ever
testing a driver before it was included in the official tree. The
staging tree allows any user to test a driver very easily, just by
enabling it during the configuration process prior to compiling the
kernel. This opens up testing to an immense and seething horde of
potential users. The result is that drivers receive far better testing
before being incorporated into the main source tree. Users are
protected from potentially damaging code in these drivers, because
they simply cannot enable drivers in the staging tree when they
compile the kernel.
</p><p>
Of course, as with all aspects of kernel development, the rules 
constantly are being revised, so that the kernel development process can
really be seen as a set of algorithms developed in an evolutionary
way that has the ultimate goal of making the best possible behaviors
also the most natural-seeming for any given kernel contributor. As
with all evolutionary development, any given snapshot presents only
the imperfect balance of that moment, but it's so great to watch.

Almost every operating system has an FTP client, but they often
are command line only or kludgy at best. If you're looking for a solid
FTP (or SSH) client, FileZilla is a cross-platform program that does a
few things and does them very well. Whether you need to transfer files
over FTP, FTP/TLS or even SSH, it has a simple interface and a reliable
code base.
</p><p>
The folks at the FileZilla Project went one step further, however, and
provided a free FTP server program for Windows as well. FileZilla's FTP
server fills a much-needed gap in the desktop Windows operating system
and provides extensive customization. It runs in the background, so
there's no need to have a window open all the time in order to have an
FTP server running. If you need a reliable FTP client for Windows,
OS X or Linux, check out FileZilla's client program. If you need an
FTP server for Windows, be sure to check out the server program:

I've been complaining about Netflix's lack of Linux desktop support for
more than a year now. All my whining seems to be making little difference,
so it seems only fair to look at alternatives. Granted, there aren't
any direct competitors to the Netflix streaming service, but there
is Hulu. Hulu has a history of not playing well with others and
blocking developers like the Boxee team, but I must give credit where
credit is due. It has a fully working Linux desktop program. Plus,
the Web-based features work as well. If you add the $7.99 monthly
subscription for Hulu Plus, you happily can watch many seasons (sometimes
the full catalog) of television programs directly on your Linux desktop.
With Hulu's desktop application, you can send the whole experience full
screen and have your own little home-entertainment system wherever you
have Internet access. Sure, there still are ads. Sure, the catalog
is different and less robust than the one from Netflix, but heck, at
least Linux users are invited to the party!

<h2 class="title">Linux on a Fingernail</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #203, March 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is all about
how to get Linux in your pocket. In this article, I go one
better and tell you how to get Linux on your fingernail. Now, before
you get too excited, I won't be discussing some new nano-computer being
used by James Bond, unfortunately. Instead, I discuss
how to put Linux on a micro-SD card (or any other USB drive, for that
matter). Using this, you can run Linux on any machine that can
boot off a USB device. 
</p><p>
One of the first utilities to receive widespread attention and
use is UNetbootin (<a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net" target="_self">unetbootin.sourceforge.net</a>). This application is available under both
Linux and Windows. It has built-in support for downloading and installing several
Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, PCLinuxOS, Linux
Mint, Sabayon Linux, openSUSE, Gentoo, Arch Linux, MEPIS and many
others.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10969pocketf1.large.jpg"><img src="10969pocketf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. UNetbootin
</p></div></div><p>
UNetbootin also has the ability to load several different system utilities,
such as the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Parted Magic: a partition manager that can resize, repair, back up and
restore partitions.
</p></li><li><p>
SystemRescueCD: a system repair, backup and recovery tool.
</p></li><li><p>
Super Grub Disk: a boot utility to restore and repair GRUB installations.
</p></li><li><p>
Backtrack: a utility for network analysis and penetration testing.
</p></li><li><p>
Ophcrack: a utility to recover Windows passwords.
</p></li><li><p>
Smart Boot Manager: boots off of CD-ROM and floppy drives on machines
with a faulty BIOS.
</p></li><li><p>
FreeDOS: an open-source DOS to allow you to run BIOS flash utilities or
just plain-old DOS.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
UNetbootin can download the correct ISO image for all
of these distributions automatically, or you can download (or create)
your own ISO image and hand the filename to UNetbootin. In either case,
the next step is to extract all of the files from the image so they
can be copied to the USB drive. The USB drive you want to use needs to
be formatted with a filesystem already on it. Once the files all
have been extracted, UNetbootin uses some heuristics to figure out where
the kernel and initrd files are hiding and places them into /ubnkern
and /ubninit. It then goes through the boot configuration files from
the ISO to try to figure out what boot options need to be set on the
USB drive. Once it figures that out, it puts those options into the
configuration file /syslinux.cfg. Then, UNetbootin uses Syslinux to make
the USB drive bootable, and you should be good to go.
</p><p>
Another utility that has started garnering a lot of attention is
usb-creator (<a href="https://launchpad.net/usb-creator" target="_self">https://launchpad.net/usb-creator</a>). This program is the official tool to create live
USB versions of Ubuntu live CDs. This utility started with version
8.04 of Ubuntu. A KDE front end showed up in version 8.10, and a Windows
version currently is in the works. This utility can do the same sort
of work as UNetbootin. It has the built-in ability to create an Ubuntu
live USB, but that's not all. Like UNetbootin, usb-creator can take
an arbitrary ISO image and copy that onto your USB drive. It even
can take a CD-ROM from your CD drive and copy its contents over to your USB
drive. It's a simple matter of selecting the source and the destination,
and then running.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10969pocketf2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. usb-creator
</p></div></div><p>
One big advantage of usb-creator is its ability to create a persistent
live USB for you very easily. Any extra space on your USB drive, above
and beyond what is required for the OS files, can be used as writable
space for persistent files. This means any changes you make to
your system will be written to the USB drive. You even have the option
of clearing the persistent space on shutdown. That way, you can use your
USB drive as a complete operating system, exactly as if it were on your
hard drive. And, there you go, Linux on a thumbnail.
</p><p>
All of these techniques require you to have either a live CD or an ISO
image of a live CD. But what if you want to go a bit more low-level, a bit
more from scratch? One of the tools available to you is Syslinux (<a href="http://syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/The_Syslinux_Project" target="_self">syslinux.zytor.com/wiki/index.php/The_Syslinux_Project</a>). Syslinux
actually is a suite of different programs that provide for booting from
many different media, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
syslinux: booting from FAT filesystems.
</p></li><li><p>
pxelinux: network booting.
</p></li><li><p>
isolinux: bootable &ldquo;El Torito&rdquo; CD-ROMs.
</p></li><li><p>
extlinux: booting from ext2/ext3/ext4 or btrfs filesystems.
</p></li><li><p>
memdisk: a tool to boot legacy OSes from nontraditional media.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Syslinux installs into the boot sector of your device and
puts a copy of the file LDLINUX.SYS into the root directory. It then
loads the kernel and other OS files from the actual filesystem. Because the
filesystem is just a simple FAT filesystem, all the files, including
the kernel, can be manipulated using standard DOS tools. By default,
Syslinux assumes the kernel is in the file named LINUX on the boot
disk. This default can be changed in the config file. If you hold down the
Shift or Alt keys during bootup, Syslinux displays a LILO-style
&ldquo;boot:&rdquo; prompt where you can enter a kernel filename and options.
</p><p>
Syslinux searches for its configuration file in the following order:
/boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg, /syslinux/syslinux.cfg, /syslinux.cfg.
</p><p>
In this file, you can set parameters to change all the default
settings. Any filenames in the configuration file are relative to the
directory that syslinux.cfg is in, unless it is a full path. A basic
example looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEFAULT linux
LABEL linux
  SAY Now booting the kernel from SYSLINUX...
  KERNEL vmlinuz.img
  APPEND ro root=/dev/sda1 initrd=initrd.img
</pre>
</p><p>
The kernel types that Syslinux supports don't need to be a regular
Linux kernel image. They can be a PXE bootstrap program, a boot sector
or a COMBOOT image.
</p><p>
These techniques and utilities should give you a good start at putting
your USB drives to their best use. You now can carry around your whole OS
in your pocket. This is essentially what I've done for my old Eee PC. With
Linux on USB, I can keep the same system there, and on my MacBook through
Parallels. You also can use the same system on basically any machine
that you can get to boot off of USB. Have fun and be creative.

<h2 class="title">Statistics with R</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #203, March 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the January 2011 issue, I looked at using Scilab to do some basic data
analysis. Although you can do a lot with Scilab, sometimes it makes more
sense to use a specialized tool. In the case of statistical problems,
that specialized tool is R, developed at Bell Labs. R is actually a full programming language,
designed for doing statistics tasks. 
It's very similar to another
statistical programming language, S. Because R and S are programming
languages, any actual programs are implementations of
this language. Commercial implementations are available, like
S-Plus. In this article, I discuss the open-source implementation by the R
Project. References to R from here on refer to this open-source
implementation.
</p><p>
R is broken up into a core engine and a full complement of libraries
and functions that provide all its capabilities. Because of this,
different downloads contain different prepackaged functions. However,
an entire repository of extra functionality is available at CRAN
(Comprehensive R Archive Network) where a strong community of people
is willing to share the work. Thus,
there usually is a function, or several, to handle almost any task you can
imagine. If not, you can develop your own. Because
R is broken down into a core engine and functions, any
graphical interface simply is bolted on top of the core. Several
graphical interfaces exist, such as RCommander or Rgui. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10969Rf1.large.jpg"><img src="10969Rf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. R on a Mac
</p></div></div><p>
Graphical interfaces also are available for Windows
and Mac OS X. Here, I'm looking at actual commands in R, so I'm 
using the text interface. To start it, simply type <tt  >R</tt>
and press Enter. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10969Rf2.large.jpg"><img src="10969Rf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Starting R
</p></div></div><p>
To quit R, type <tt  >q();</tt> and
press Enter. In R, commands can end either with a semicolon or newline.
</p><p>
R has extensive help files for all the commands and
functions, which are in the form of man pages. You can access these help pages in two ways:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; help(command)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; ?command
</pre>
</p><p>
You can run
a whole series of commands with the source command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; source("commands.R")
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
where the file &ldquo;commands.R&rdquo; contains all the commands you want
to run as a single block. Think of it as if it were a shell script. You
can send your output to a file with the sink command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; sink("output.txt")
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you are done writing the output, you can reset the output back to
the console with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; sink()
</pre>
</p><p>
R can handle basic statistics out of the box. The available functions can
do all the single variable statistics you're familiar with doing. The
first step is to load data. Data is stored in lists, which can be
arranged as arrays and matrices. The easiest way to create data arrays
is to use the concatenation function <tt  >c</tt>. It works well when you 
have only a little bit of data to work with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; data1 = c(2,3,4,2,0,1,2)
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a single list and dumps these values into the variable
data1. Then you can use this variable in other functions&mdash;for example,
to find the average of these values, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; mean(data1)
[1] 2
</pre>
</p><p>
The second line above is the output from the function
<tt  >mean</tt>. Output is
labeled with a numeric label: <tt  >[1]</tt>. The output from the first command in a
session has the label <tt  >[1]</tt>; the output from the second command is labeled
<tt  >[2]</tt> and so on. If you have a larger amount of data to
work with, use the read command to read in a file. If that data
is in a table format, you can read the table in as a whole with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; DataToUse = read.table("research.data")
</pre>
</p><p>
You can access individual data elements by using the [] characters, so
printing the second item is as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; data1[2]
[1] 3
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to set a value in a vector, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; data1[2] = 5
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's say you were making some measurements on whales. You
would start by saving the data into a variable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; whale = c(74,122,235,111,292,111,211,133,156,79)
</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing you would want to do is to run some basic statistical
functions to find the mean, variance and standard deviation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; mean(whale)
[1] 152.4
&gt; var(whale)
[2] 5113.378
&gt;std(whale)
Error: couldn't find function "std"
</pre>
</p><p>
It looks like there is no standard deviation function. But, because R is
a full programming language, you can write your own:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; std = function(x) sqrt(var(x))
&gt; std(whale)
[3] 71.50789
</pre>
</p><p>
This shows one of the shortcomings of R. Because it is such a large system,
it does tend to have a relatively steep learning curve. More research
would have shown that there is a built-in standard deviation function;
it's just called sd instead of std:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; sd(whale)
[4] 71.50789
</pre>
</p><p>
Sometimes it's worth taking the extra time to do some research before
storming forward and writing all the code yourself.
</p><p>
R has very extensive graphing capabilities as well. It generates very
high-quality plots and graphs you can use in publications. The
commands can be very simple, if you just want a quick display so
you can inspect your data visually. If you want very specific output,
with lots of markup and customizations, R provides full control
over all your graphs' details. The most basic plot command is
simply plot. Let's say you have a series of 2-D data:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; x = c(1,2,3,4)
&gt; y = c(2,3,4,5)
&gt; plot(x,y)
</pre>
</p><p>
This gives us the plot shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10969Rf3.large.jpg"><img src="10969Rf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Example Plot
</p></div></div><p>
This looks like a straight
line, so you probably want to do a linear regression on it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; abline(lm(y~x))
</pre>
</p><p>
This command does the linear regression of a straight line and plots
it on the same plot (Figure 4). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10969Rf4.large.jpg"><img src="10969Rf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Linear Regression of a Straight Line Plotted on the Example Plot
</p></div></div><p>
It seems a pretty close fit,
so you probably should look at the coefficients of the linear model:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; lm(y~x)
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)           x
          1           1
</pre>
</p><p>
So you end up with a straight line with a slope of 1 and an intercept of 1.
</p><p>
Once you've done all your analysis, you'll probably want to generate
some nice plots for your publication. By default, when you call one of
the plotting functions, the output is the graphical display. But, you can
change this to an output file of a particular format. Let's say you want
to generate some PNGs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; png("filename.png")
&gt; plot(x,y)
</pre>
</p><p>
This will save your plot to the file &ldquo;filename.png&rdquo;. You also can save
to several other file formats (JPG, PDF, PostScript and so on). 
Many other options are available, so check out the help page.
</p><p>
This short crash course should give you a starting point for
exploring R. See the R Project's main page for more information
(<a href="http://www.r-project.org" target="_self">www.r-project.org</a>), and remember to check out the
CRAN repository (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org" target="_self">cran.r-project.org</a>) before you put too much work
into it. If you'd like me to cover any scientific packages or computational
science techniques, please let me know.

<h2 class="title">GUI from Afar</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #203, March 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For most configurations, I prefer to use command-line tools. This is
especially true on headless servers. There are a few things, however,
that I find easier to configure with GUI tools. Webmin does a fine
job for some of those things, but sometimes the native GUI tools are
really nice. One good example is virt-manager. Although it's possible to
run virt-manager on a workstation separate from the server running KVM,
sometimes installing virt-manager also installs kernel modules that are
incompatible with other virtual systems.
</p><p>
In my particular scenario, I like to run VirtualBox on my workstation,
but KVM on my server. Although it is possible to run virt-manager on a
workstation with VirtualBox installed, it can get messy with conflicting
kernel modules. That's where <tt  >ssh -X</tt> comes into play. Just install
virt-manager on the server, run it remotely with a simple <tt  >ssh -X
user@server virt-manager</tt>, and the GUI program starts up right on your
current desktop!
</p><p>
It's not a new trick, but it's one I find myself using often. If you
haven't considered installing GUI tools on your headless server, just
because it seemed silly, don't forget the GUI power of SSH. It might
make your life a little easier&mdash;or at least more colorful.

I'm sure many of you carry around your monthly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
with you everywhere. Sure, the glossy paper does tend to get a little
beaten up, but having important reference material with you at all
times is worth a bit of wear and tear.
On the other hand, we know some
of you take meticulous care of your issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, placing them
gingerly on your coffee table for all your guests to marvel at. Either
is perfectly fine with us, but we have a portability solution that will work
for everyone. Visit LinuxJournal.com from your mobile device, and you'll
notice you are now viewing a simplified version of the site that is
optimized for a mobile experience. We hope this proves useful to you while
you are off on all your geeky adventures, or even when you are just sitting
around the dinner table and need to show your friend that awesome blog post
by Shawn Powers you read last week. Happy surfing!

<h2 class="title">Silly Programs</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Those of us who have been using Linux for a long time all know the joy
of silly programs like xeyes. One of my favorites, however, is good
old xsnow. Whether you love the cold weather or live in Florida and
like to ski on occasion, xsnow will add some winter fun to your desktop.
The xsnow program has been around forever and is surely available for
your distribution.
</p><p>
If you're absolutely against snow and all its icy accomplices, you
might want to check out a couple other oldies but goodies. Back before we
had fancy computer games, we used to waste time with programs like xneko
(you'll probably find it now as oneko), which was a little cat that
chased your &ldquo;mouse&rdquo; around the screen. Or, perhaps you still enjoy the
ever-staring eyes of xeyes (or a more modern tuxeyes). Finally,
if your time-wasting tastes are a bit more on the macabre side, xroach (or
groach) might tickle your fancy with bugs that scurry to hide under the
windows on your desktop. Whatever your thoughts on silly time-wasting
apps, you owe it to yourself to check out a bit of Linux/UNIX history.
