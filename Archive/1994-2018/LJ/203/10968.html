NOOKcolor: E-reader or Internet tablet?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243f580.0x2537250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The march of technology never ends. Not long ago (in the December 2010
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, actually), I reviewed the Android-powered NOOK
e-reader from Barnes &amp; Noble. That product was an E Ink-based product,
running Android 1.5. What a difference a few months can bring. Barnes
&amp; Noble has just released its second-generation e-reader, the
NOOKcolor. As one can gather from the name, the NOOKcolor's immediate
distinguishing factor is a 7" color touchscreen, while the original NOOK
had a 6" black-and-white E Ink screen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10968f1.large.jpg"><img src="10968f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

NOOKcolor&mdash;an Overview</h2></div></div><p>
Although the original NOOK was a decent enough e-reader and could be hacked
to add additional functionality, the NOOKcolor borders on being an actual
Android-powered tablet. Table 1 compares the specifications for the two units.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x243f580.0x2537778"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. NOOK vs. NOOKcolor</b></p><table     summary="Table 1.

Looking at the specs, you can see that the NOOKcolor is a much more
capable device. Unlike the original NOOK, the NOOKcolor is much hungrier
for battery life&mdash;that excellent color IPS screen gobbles a lot of
power. The NOOKcolor can run for 8&ndash;10 hours on a charge,
while the original NOOK was good for a couple days if I kept the
wireless radios off. The NOOKcolor charges via the Micro USB connector on
the bottom edge of the unit, much like the original NOOK did. However,
unlike the original NOOK, the NOOKcolor <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be plugged in to its wall
charger to charge fully. A computer's USB port will supply only 500ma,
which isn't enough to charge the NOOKcolor under operating conditions
and will only slightly trickle-charge the unit when it's asleep. The
NOOKcolor's wall charger puts out 2000ma, which is enough to charge the
unit fully in about three hours. There is a little &ldquo;n&rdquo; logo embossed in
the Micro USB cord end that glows with the charging status of the NOOKcolor
(yellow for charging, green for fully charged), which is a nice touch.
</p><p>
As with the original NOOK, the NOOKcolor can read several media types:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
EPUB e-books (with and without DRM).
</p></li><li><p>
Mobi/eReader e-books (with and without DRM).
</p></li><li><p>
PDF, XLS, DOC, PPT and other office-related formats.
</p></li><li><p>
MP3 and AAC audio files (can be played in the background while reading).
</p></li><li><p>
JPEG, GIF, PNG and BMP image types.
</p></li><li><p>
MP4 video playback (new to NOOKcolor).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The NOOKcolor also includes a fairly capable, much improved Web browser
over the original NOOK, and it ships with Pandora Internet Radio,
a chess game, a sudoku game and a crossword puzzle game.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243f580.0x252f768"></a>
Using the NOOKcolor</h2></div></div><p>
I've never covered an &ldquo;unboxing&rdquo; ritual before, but I feel compelled to
mention it with the NOOKcolor. Your first impression of the NOOKcolor is
when you open the box, and Barnes &amp; Noble really did a great job on the
packaging. It's a cardboard box that utilizes a magnetic closure to hold
the lower one-third of the box closed. You pivot the lower one-third back,
and it'll bend back and is held against the back of the box by another
magnet, where you can reach inside the box and pull the NOOKcolor out
of its recycled cardboard sarcophagus. It's wholly unnecessary, but
absolutely awesome in its execution, and it gives you a clue as to what
Barnes &amp; Noble is thinking: the NOOKcolor is no device to be trifled with.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10968f2.large.jpg"><img src="10968f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Unboxing the NOOKcolor
</p></div></div><p>
The initial boot of the NOOKcolor drops you into a wizard that walks
you through your Barnes &amp; Noble store account and initial Wi-Fi access
point setup. The unit also displays a short video that shows you
the NOOKcolor's features. The NOOKcolor doesn't have much in the
way of hardware buttons&mdash;only a power button on the left edge, volume
rocker on the right edge and an n button at the bottom center of the
screen. If you push the n button, you'll be taken back to the home
screen, where you can select any books on the NOOKcolor's desktop.
</p><p>
There's also a little arrow on the screen, right above the n
button. Its normal mode is up, but when pressed, it rotates down, and
a pop-up menu is exposed. This is the NOOKcolor's main menu. From here,
you can select Library where you can choose your reading material.
The Shop button connects you to the Barnes &amp; Noble on-line store. The Search
button is, well, a search. Extras is where the other NOOK programs
are, such as Pandora, sudoku and chess. Web launches the Web browser,
and Settings is where you can adjust system settings like Wi-Fi, screen
brightness and so on.

</p></div></div><p>
As good as a reading experience as I found the original NOOK, the
NOOKcolor is better in almost every way. The instantaneous response of the
IPS color touchscreen is a treat after the perceptible wait of the E Ink
screen of the original NOOK. Although I found the original NOOK acceptable,
not having the flash of the screen and the page flipping delay is quite
nice. I'm fortunate in that I'm not prone to eye strain, so looking at the
NOOKcolor's screen wasn't an issue for me, but if you're prone to that,
you might want to test-drive a NOOKcolor at your local Barnes &amp; Noble
for a bit. The one place the color screen is a liability is in bright
light or sunlight. It just can't compete with the E Ink screen of the
original NOOK under those conditions. Personally, I prefer the vivid,
backlit screen of the NOOKcolor. You can see it in Figure 4, with John Scalzi's
excellent book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Android's Dream</em></span> displayed (get it if you haven't
already!). All the original NOOK features for highlighting, bookmarking and
instant dictionary lookup are present and accounted for.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10968f4.large.jpg"><img src="10968f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Page flipping on the NOOKcolor is a completely different experience from
the original NOOK too, as the unit has no hardware page forward/reverse
buttons. Instead, you use the touchscreen to swipe across
the screen, like you are turning the pages of a book. Alternatively,
tapping the right side of the screen advances the page, and tapping
the left side of the screen flips a page back. Unfortunately, there
is no &ldquo;page-flipping&rdquo; animation&mdash;the screen simply displays the next
page. I'd like to see a page-flipping animation while using the swipe
gesture and have the current behavior on screen taps, as the shorter
gesture implies a faster page turn.
</p><p>
The NOOKcolor's on-line store experience is similar to the original
NOOK, however, the vivid color screen really helps make the
act of shopping a breeze. Again, Barnes &amp; Noble built on its earlier
technology and polished the edges of the on-line store, while keeping
all of the good things about it, like automatic downloading of content
in the event you replace your NOOK.
</p><p>
The Web browser is one area in which the old NOOK needed lots of work,
and Barnes &amp; Noble delivered. In fairness, it's the stock browser from
Android 2.1, but the old NOOK's browser was so bad, the new browser beats
it hands down. The new browser also scores 93/100 on the Acid3 test&mdash;not fully compliant, but it works a lot better than the browser in the
original NOOK. It's this browser that makes you think the NOOKcolor
may have more to it than meets the eye.

More than Meets the Eye&mdash;Rooting the NOOKcolor</h2></div></div><p>
If you've been following along, you'll see that the NOOKcolor's a
very capable device, hardware-speaking, and it runs Android. The
folks at NookDevs thought the same thing, and they started poking at the
NOOKcolor. They decided to attempt to root, or gain control of the
hardware outside any blocks put on it by the manufacturer. They found
that the device can be booted off a properly formatted MicroSD card. If
they put their own OS on it, they could, in theory, boot off the card,
mount the NOOKcolor's internal disk and make changes to it, allowing
for installation of other software and modification of the unit. This
is exactly what they did, and it turns out the NOOKcolor makes a very
capable Internet tablet. Because this is a highly moving target at the time of this
writing&mdash;literally, advances are being made almost on an hourly basis&mdash;I'm not going to do a step-by-step account of the method. Rather, I
touch on the concepts here, and for current details, check out the
NookDevs portal Web site (see Resources).
</p><p>
The method to root the NOOKcolor at the time of this writing is to use a specially
prepared image of a MicroSD card. Once you get that image, you <tt  >dd</tt> write
it to a MicroSD card, then boot the NOOKcolor off the card. The NOOKcolor
will not have anything on its display during the boot, so you need to have a bit of faith
and wait a while, then pull the card and reboot the unit. If all goes
well, once the NOOKcolor reboots, you should be able to talk to it
using the <tt  >adb</tt> command found in the Android SDK. If the result of 
<tt  >adb devices</tt> shows a serial number, you're talking to your
NOOKcolor via the debugger, and you can sideload programs in the Android
.apk format to it! Anything you add to the NOOKcolor appears in the
Extras menu, so it's easy to get to and launch those new programs.
</p><p>
At this point, you can start pushing software to the NOOKcolor.
Quite a few sites host Android freeware on the Internet (one of
them is in the Resources section of this article). You even can get the ad-supported
free version of the hit game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span> running on the NOOKcolor. It
runs flawlessly, and it's an excellent time killer. At this point, the
sky's the limit. You can swap out launchers for alternate launchers and
modify the system further (see NookDevs for examples of what you can do).

Figure 6. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span> Running on the NOOKcolor
</p></div></div><p>
So there you have it&mdash;the NOOKcolor is a good e-reader and a very
hackable device. If you're in the market for something fun to play with 
that has good build quality and lots of potential, check out the NOOKcolor
at your local Barnes &amp; Noble. It's a very nice device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243f580.0x2530948"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Dangers of Rooting Your NOOKcolor</b></p><p>
Obviously, anything you do to modify the NOOKcolor voids your warranty
instantly. Do not try to return it or pass off anything you've done
as a factory issue. If you break it, you keep both pieces. You should
be technically adept and have a good working knowledge of Linux before
attempting any rooting processes. If you have any data on the unit,
back it up, as you run the risk of erasing that data.
</p><p>
Having said all that, 90% of all the things that can go wrong with rooting
a NOOKcolor can be fixed by doing a factory restore of the firmware. To
do that, simply turn the unit off, then press and hold the Volume Up key,
n button, and power button until the NOOKcolor turns on. You'll then
be prompted with a Factory Reset wizard. Follow the steps to confirm
the reset, and the NOOK will restore its firmware from a .zip file on
a hidden partition of the internal Flash.
</p><p>
Please be sure to read the current instructions at NookDevs <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
attempting anything, as things are likely to change dramatically by the time this article is printed.

Breaking News</b></p><p>
At the time of this writing, many things still are being discovered
about the NOOKcolor. It appears that the chipsets inside the unit have
Bluetooth functionality, and that it's simply disabled in the kernel
and OS. There's strong evidence of that, but I was unable to get the
reported Bluetooth operating, although others have claimed success with
basic pairing to other Bluetooth devices. Check in on the crew at NookDevs
for the latest news on what's going on with the NOOKcolor.
