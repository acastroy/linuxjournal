A new way of looking at testing.

Last month, I covered Shoulda, a Ruby gem that allows you to test
your code using a method called behavior-driven development. BDD,
as it is known, is closely related to test-driven development (TDD),
which has become increasingly popular during the past few years,
particularly within the Ruby community.
</p><p>
In both BDD and TDD, you start to program by writing a test that the
program should pass, if it's working correctly. Of course, because
the program hasn't been written yet, the test will fail. You then
write the smallest amount of code possible to ensure that the test
passes. When that happens, you continue coding by writing
another test. The fact that your code is tested completely gives you
the confidence and flexibility to &ldquo;refactor&rdquo;, moving code around and
joining it together, without having to worry about introducing new,
subtle bugs.
</p><p>
BDD differs from TDD not in its overall method, but rather in its
approach and semantics. BDD concentrates on how things look from the
outside, rather than from the inside of the code. In the case of a Web
application, this often means looking at things from the user's
perspective, or if you're a consultant, from the customer's
perspective. No longer are you testing the code&mdash;instead, you are 
checking that it meets its specifications. Thus, working with BDD 
requires that you constantly think of yourself as a consumer of a
particular piece of code, and that you consider what it should do at
each point, if it is to work correctly. I intentionally use the word
<span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> here, because as you will see, that is an especially important
word in the RSpec vocabulary, and it appears in nearly every test.
</p><p>
RSpec has become quite popular among Ruby programmers in general and
Rails programmers in particular. It also is closely tied to several
other high-quality testing technologies, such as Cucumber and
Celerity, which I will explore in coming months. And, although RSpec is
not everyone's cup of tea, it is popular enough that you should expect
to encounter it if you do any Ruby development. Moreover, it is often
good to try something different, and RSpec definitely is different,
providing a new way of looking at testing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d78720"></a>
Installing RSpec</h2></div></div><p>
The home page for RSpec is <a href="http://rspec.info" target="_self">rspec.info</a>, which contains
instructions for installing RSpec, either on its own or as part of a
Rails application. I'm looking at a simple Rails application this
month as an example, so you need to install both parts.
</p><p>
The first requirement is installing two Ruby gems, both of which are
stored on the popular repository for open-source projects, GitHub.
You can install these gems with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install rspec rspec-rails -V --source
 &#8618;http://gems.github.com/
</pre>
</p><p>
(If you already have installed GitHub as a source for gem
installations, you don't need to specify it in this command.)
</p><p>
Note that if you have older RSpec-related gems installed, such as
rspec_generator or spicycode_rspec_extensions, you probably
should remove them from your system. Current versions of RSpec handle these
functions for you, and I have encountered problems and conflicts that
disappeared when I removed those old gems.
</p><p>
Now that you have RSpec installed, let's create a new, simple Rails
project. I often like to use an address book (and appointment
calendar) for my examples, so let's create one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails --database=postgresql appointments
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember, Rails assumes you have three databases for your
application, one each for the development, test and production
environments. The database parameters are defined in
config/database.yml. I assume you are able to set these
configuration parameters correctly. Although you don't necessarily need a
production database for the purposes of this column, you will need both
development and test databases.
</p><p>
Now you must tell the Rails application to include RSpec. There are
plugins for RSpec, but I generally prefer to use gems when possible.
Modern versions of Rails allow you to include gems in
config/environment.rb by adding the following two lines:


<pre     class="programlisting">
config.gem "rspec", :lib =&gt; false, :version =&gt; "&gt;= 1.2.0"
config.gem "rspec-rails", :lib =&gt; false, :version =&gt; "&gt;= 1.2.0"
</pre>
</p><p>
With the gems in place, you now can put RSpec in place for your Rails
application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate rspec
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a spec directory (parallel to the test directory,
which it effectively replaces). The spec directory contains, by
default, three files:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
rcov.opts: setting options for running the Ruby coverage tool
rcov when run from within RSpec.
</p></li><li><p>
rspec.opts: setting options for RSpec itself.
</p></li><li><p>
spec_helper.rb: a Ruby file containing global definitions and
configurations for the individual specifications, much like
test_helper.rb performs in Test::Unit.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With the spec directory in place, you can begin to use the
special RSpec generators for models, controllers and scaffolds. For
example, you normally would generate a person model with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate model person first_name:text last_name:text
</pre>
</p><p>
This still will work, but any automatically generated tests will use
Test::Unit, installing files into the test directory. By contrast,
you can use:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate rspec_model person first_name:text last_name:text
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates the same model file, but also creates a skeleton
set of RSpec tests.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d791c8"></a>
Model Testing with RSpec</h2></div></div><p>
Let's create a slightly more sophisticated version of the person model:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate rspec_model person first_name:text \
    last_name:text email_address:text phone_number:text \
    sex:text
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a migration, which you can use to create the first version
of your person model:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, it's true that you should go into the migration file and modify
things, such that (for example) the person's name, e-mail
address and sex are all mandatory. However, let's ignore that
step for now and assume that you want all of your validation logic to
be at the application layer. In such a case, you would want to put
some validations in the model file.
</p><p>
Well, you could do that, but that wouldn't be very BDD of you, would
it? Rather, you should imagine the specification that a consumer, or
the manager, might want from a &ldquo;person&rdquo; object, and then build the
object up to adhere to those standards.
</p><p>
For example, you might want to ensure the presence of the first
and last names. So, the first file to modify is 
spec/models/person_spec.rb, rather than app/models/person.rb. (For
reasons I don't quite understand, Test::Unit calls model tests
unit tests, and RSpec calls them model tests, and the controller
tests are called functional tests.) If you open that file, you'll
see a new, bare-bones specification:


<pre     class="programlisting">
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/../spec_helper')

describe Person do
  before(:each) do
    @valid_attributes = {
      :first_name =&gt; "value for first_name",
      :last_name =&gt; "value for last_name",
      :email_address =&gt; "value for email_address",
      :phone_number =&gt; "value for phone_number",
      :sex =&gt; "value for sex"
    }
  end

  it "should create a new instance given valid attributes" do
    Person.create!(@valid_attributes)
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
You can run your full suite of specs at any time, by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake spec
</pre>
</p><p>
The first line imports anything defined in spec_helper, which I
mentioned earlier. Next comes a describe line; this will be
familiar to those of you who have looked at Shoulda. The basic idea
is that someone reading the specification reads the argument to
&ldquo;describe&rdquo; and then reads each of the individual specifications that
start with &ldquo;it&rdquo;. In other words, this spec file tries to say
&ldquo;Person should create a new instance given valid attributes.&rdquo;
And,
sure enough, it does.
</p><p>
The before(:each) block tells RSpec what it should invoke before each
&ldquo;it&rdquo; block. This ensures that the @valid_attributes instance variable
will be set to a predictable value before running each spec. You then can
modify @valid_attributes as necessary within each spec, as you
will soon see.
</p><p>
The thing is, you're checking the validity of your specification by
creating a new instance of Person. You can do that, but if the spec
fails, you will end up with a code backtrace mixed in with your
report. For this reason, I'm going to change the existing spec
definition to look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
it "should create a new instance given valid attributes" do
  p = Person.new(@valid_attributes)
  p.should be_valid
  p.save.should_not == false
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Instead of Person.create, you now are invoking Person.new, assigning it
to the variable p. Let's check p in two different ways, once using
should and the other using should_not. These methods are mixed in by
RSpec to the Object class and contain a great deal of
behind-the-scenes magic to make specifications readable, almost as if
they were in plain English. For example, when you say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p.should be_valid
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x1d79b68"></a></h2></div></div><p>
RSpec's should method looks for a method named valid? for that
object and checks that the invocation of this method returns true.
This works for any predicate (that is, method that returns true or
false). If should or should_not is followed by be_XXX, RSpec
turns that into a method call of XXX? on the object instance.
</p><p>
So, you can understand what it means to say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p.save.should_not == false
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x2171f70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which you equivalently could write in a more positive, optimistic way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p.save.should == true
</pre>
</p><p>
In both cases, you invoke the save method on the object and check
that its returned value is true. You might argue that you don't need
to invoke both new and save on your object, but I like to make sure
the object is valid in both Ruby and the database. After all, it
could be that you told the database to reject null values, but that you
allowed it using validations in your ActiveRecord definition.
</p><p>
Now let's move a bit beyond the defaults to set some limits on
attributes. Presumably, you want people in your database to have all of
these fields (first name, last name, e-mail address, phone number
and sex) defined. If you were developing in a non-TDD/BDD way, you
first would set up validations for all of those and then add some
tests. But, here you're trying to write tests first, thinking from the
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; how your object might behave. And indeed, each person should
have a first name, a last name, an e-mail address and a telephone
number. (Strange as it might seem now, there was once a time when
having an e-mail address was not expected.)
</p><p>
So you could, for example, include the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
it "should not be valid without a first name" do
  @valid_attributes.delete[:first_name]
  p = Person.new(@valid_attributes)
  p.should_not be_valid
  p.save.should == false
end
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, you take @valid_attributes, remove the :first_name key
from it and then create a new person with the rest of the name-value
pairs from @valid_attributes. This should not work, because everyone
needs a first name. But when I run the specs, I get:


<pre     class="programlisting">
1)
'Person should not be valid without a first name' FAILED
expected valid? to return false, got true
./spec/models/person_spec.rb:23:

Finished in 0.038731 seconds

2 examples, 1 failure
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, the specification failed. But that's okay&mdash;that's
precisely what you want when you're working in BDD fashion. You wrote a
test, it failed, and now you can go into the code and modify it, so as
to ensure that the test passes. Ensuring that this current test
passes is a simple matter of adding a validation to your ActiveRecord
model. Instead of being the empty default:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c80580.0x2172440"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you need to make it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_presence_of :first_name
end

</pre>
</p><p>
I save this change, run <tt  >rake spec</tt> again, and sure enough, I get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Finished in 0.070752 seconds
2 examples, 0 failures
</pre>
</p><p>
What's next? Now I can move on to the other fields, one by one, in
order to test them. And indeed, this back and forth is precisely the
way you want to work when you're programming in TDD/BDD fashion. You
add a spec indicating what the object <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> do, watch the spec
fail and then add the appropriate line or lines for it to work that
way.
</p><p>
You can get a bit fancier than merely checking whether attributes exist.
RSpec's should method is very powerful, allowing you to check
equality (==), numeric comparisons (&lt; and &gt;) and regular expression
matches, among other things.
</p><p>
When using RSpec on models, to a large degree, you can rely on the
built-in validations that Rails provides. For example, you presumably
want the sex field to contain either an M or an F. If someone
enters a value other than that, you should not save it to the database.
The first step toward such a feature is the introduction of a new spec:

<pre     class="programlisting">
it "should forbid characters other than M and F" do
  @valid_attributes[:sex] = 'Z'
  p = Person.new(@valid_attributes)
  p.should_not be_valid
  p.save.should == false
end
</pre>
</p><p>
I run <tt  >rake spec</tt>, and find that this test fails. Again, that's to be
expected, and now I can modify my Person class such that it is more
restrictive:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :first_name
  validates_inclusion_of :sex, :in =&gt; %w(M F), :message =&gt; 
  "Sex must be either M or F"
end

</pre>
</p><p>
When I run <tt  >rake spec</tt>, I get a failure, but not from this latest
spec, which passed just fine, telling me that Z is illegal. Rather,
what fails is the first spec, in which @valid_attributes has set the
key sex to the value for sex. Once again, that's fine; the
fact that I have moved forward in small, incremental steps gives me a
chance to identify such issues and fix them, before things get too
out of hand. By modifying @valid_attributes such that it uses an M
(or an F, if you prefer), the specs work.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
RSpec offers a refreshingly different, but still somewhat familiar,
approach to issues of testing. By thinking in terms of behavior and
specifications, rather than configuration and internals, it becomes
easier to create tests. The natural &ldquo;describe&rdquo;, &ldquo;it&rdquo;
and &ldquo;should&rdquo;
terms used in RSpec were chosen carefully, and they help turn testing
into a joint venture among all parties, not just programmers.
</p><p>
Although I covered only built-in RSpec matchers (that is, the test that
comes after should), it is possible, and even encouraged, to create
your own custom matchers for objects in your project.
</p><p>
Next month, I'll continue exploring RSpec by looking at
the ways you can test controllers. This raises a number of
questions and issues, including those having to do with model objects
that are instantiated while inside a controller. As you will see,
RSpec's &ldquo;mock objects&rdquo; will make this problem much less painful than
it otherwise might be.

The home page for RSpec is <a href="http://rspec.info" target="_self">rspec.info</a>, and it contains
installation and configuration documentation, as well as pointers to
other documents. The Pragmatic Programmers recently released a book
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>The RSpec Book</em></span>, written by RSpec maintainer David Chelimsky
and many others actively involved in the RSpec community. If you are
interested in using RSpec (or its cousin, the BDD tool Cucumber), 
this book is an excellent starting point. An RSpec mailing list,
which is helpful and friendly but fairly high volume, is at
