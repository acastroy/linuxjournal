H.D.S. Hungary's Hard Disk Sentinel</h2></div></div><p>
The &ldquo;ounce of prevention&rdquo; guys at H.D.S. Hungary have released version 2.9
of Hard Disk Sentinel, a data protection solution that monitors the status
of solid-state and hard disks. Hard Disk Sentinel provides detailed disk
information, statistics, alerts and backup functions, alerting to present
or future disk problems, such as excessive temperature or degradation of
disk health, which are signs of imminent hardware failure. The company
touts the solution's unique support for a wide range of both internal
IDE/SATA/SCSI/SAS and external USB/FireWire/e-Sata hard disks and hard
disk enclosures. The new version 2.9 offers deep disk tests to verify
hard disk noise, performance and temperature changes. In addition,
disk information in RAID arrays connected to 3ware/AMCC and ARECA
RAID controllers and solid-state disk features also can be detected.
The Enterprise server solution allows monitoring and managing of disk
information of remote hosts from a centralized administration console.

Kaltura Community Edition</h2></div></div><p>
Making the space for on-line video more interesting is Kaltura
Community Edition (KCE), which Kaltura dubs &ldquo;the world's first and
only open-source, self-hosted on-line video platform&rdquo;. The freely
downloadable KCE allows any site owner or Web developer to integrate
customizable video and interactive rich-media functionalities, including
video management, publishing, uploading, importing, syndicating, editing,
annotating, remixing, sharing and advertising. Kaltura also claims
that KCE breaks the &ldquo;build vs. buy&rdquo; conundrum and vendor lock-in by
allowing publishers and enterprises to build upon and extend 
an existing robust platform to customize fully their own self-hosted
solution on their own servers, behind their own firewalls and at no cost.
The company further offers paid support services. KCE runs on Linux,
Mac and Windows and is slated to be available on several cloud
computing platforms.

Jedox's ODBO Driver for Palo</h2></div></div><p>
Led by the kick-butt motto &ldquo;Excel without the hell&rdquo;, the company Jedox
has announced &ldquo;the industry's first free ODBO [OLE DB for OLAP]
driver&rdquo;

the new ODBO connectivity allows users to carry out advanced OLAP-based
Pivot table queries in Excel without the need for expensive licenses for

directly to Palo's OLAP cubes. The company calls &ldquo;Excel plus
Palo&rdquo;
a solution with all the advantages of a centralized BI solution without
the cost and time.
