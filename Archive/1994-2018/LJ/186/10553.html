Twitter</h4><p>
I'm with Kyle Rankin on Twitter, and what is more, I have tried it [see Kyle
Rankin and Bill Childers' Point/Counterpoint debate on Twitter in the August
2009 issue].
As far as I have found, at least 90%, probably 99%, of content is pointless
and uninteresting, even from the few people that I know. Reading the drivel
of strangers is even more time-wasting. What I am doing now is usually
private and personal&mdash;not even for sharing with friends, let alone with,
potentially, the whole world.
</p><p>
Several years ago, I gave up all forms of instant messaging. I am not
prepared to react instantly to the needs of others. If people want to
contact me, they can send me e-mail, and I will reply when I feel like it. There
is
no need for anything to be instant. I stopped answering the telephone six
years ago and have not died from the lack of instant contact. In fact, it
is
quiet peaceful.

I envy your ability to shut out the &ldquo;on call&rdquo; structure so many of
us are required to live out. That said, Twitter either can be useful
or it can be a time suck. The same thing can be said for tons of
everyday things we use: cell phones, e-mail, instant messaging, books,
food and so on. I'm not suggesting a person would die without Twitter
(unlike with food), but I say, if it's useful, use it. If not, don't.&mdash;Ed.

Dropbox
</h4><p>
I just received my August 2009 <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> and noticed that next
month, Cross-Platform Development is the topic. I recently came across a cool app
that helps share files across cross-platform OSes without a hitch.
It is called Dropbox (<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com" target="_self">www.getdropbox.com</a>). They have installs for Linux,
MS and Apple. I actually can share files in my Virtual Machine with my
host, without having to make sure that the file shares are set up properly.
</p><p>
They offer a 2GB account for free subscribers, and you can access your
files from their &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; from any computer that has Internet
access. For
larger groups, they have options for paid accounts with larger space
provisions.
</p><p>
You guys are still the highlight to my trips to the mailbox each month!
Keep it up!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
soosurfer   <br><br>
</p><p>
You're absolutely right. Dropbox is one of those nifty
apps that is
indeed cross-platform and largely relies on Internet-hosted services.
It's not quite a Web-based app, but leverages the Internet as
a means to communicate. We demonstrated the virtues of Dropbox on our
Web site as well: <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/dropbox-linux" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/video/dropbox-linux</a>.
It's an awesome tool!&mdash;Ed.

Using banner Instead of motd for Legal Text
</h4><p>
In the article &ldquo;Right Command, Wrong Server&rdquo; [July 2009], Kyle Rankin mentioned adding
a
legal warning to the message of the day to be delivered to users after
they
log in. For legal warnings, I believe the sshd banner option would be more
appropriate. The banner is presented to users before a successful login,
so
people are warned well before they gain access to the system. Edit the
/etc/ssh/sshd_config (or distro-specific sshd_config location),
and uncomment the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Banner /etc/issue.net
</pre>
</p><p>
Then create the text file (/etc/issue.net) that contains your legal
warnings to be presented to users before they even attempt to log in.
Remember to restart sshd to apply the change.

<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> Thanks for the tip!
IANAL, so I'm not even sure how
effective these notices
are in a court of law. I recommend checking with a lawyer to see how
enforceable these notices are before you do a system-wide deployment.

Help with MyBook Hack
</h4><p>
I am an <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> subscriber, and I was so inspired by Federico
Lucifredi's article &ldquo;Hacking Your Portable Linux Server&rdquo; in the
July 2009 issue that I
searched eBay until I was able to buy my own WD MyBook WE NAS drive
[MDL:WD10000G032-001]. On eBay, it was advertised as WDG1NC10000N World
Edition 1TB. I don't know yet if there is any subtle difference between
these models. It arrived three days ago, and without trouble, my browser brought
up the WD Shared Storage Manager Web interface, reporting firmware version
2.00.15. As an upgrade was available, I immediately upgraded to 2.00.18. I
easily followed your article's instructions and used Martin Hinner's script
to set up SSH and then log in from a terminal on my PC running Linux Mint.
(Shared Storage Manager gave the &ldquo;update has failed&rdquo; message that you
mentioned, as expected with this latest firmware.) I switched to root, made
ssh permanent through inittab, and disabled MioNet (line 19 in my
post_network_start.sh) and also verified that my kernel was 2.6.17.14. I logged
out, rebooted, logged back in, and yes, ssh was permanent. So far so good.
Martin Hinner also provided instructions to install nano, an alternative text
editor to vi, so I used wget to obtain the ncurses-5.7 (required by nano) and
nano-2.09 tarballs and untarred them. When I tried
<tt  >./configure</tt> for
ncurses-5.7, I hit a wall! It reported &ldquo;gcc no, cc no, no acceptable cc
found in $PATH.&rdquo;
</p><p>
As I understand it, the problem is (at least) that there is no gcc compiler
on this MyBook. I have checked almost every directory, and it's certainly not in
/usr/bin or /usr/sbin or anywhere else that I can see. So my question is,
how can I install a gcc ARM9 compiler? I will need to obtain it as a
compatible binary and install it, so gcc source doesn't help me unless I
need to first cross-compile on my Linux Mint PC and then transfer from
there. This is less important, but it would be interesting to know: when did WD stop
including gcc? If I hadn't upgraded from 2.00.15 to 2.00.18, would the
compiler still have been there? Could it be a subtle difference between my
WD10000G032-001 and the WDG1NC10000N? Could Martin Hinner's scripts or
anything else I did have deleted gcc? I am stuck and can't make any progress
until I get a working compiler. 
</p><p>
Your article mentioned the presence of
gcc3.4.2, gmake, wget and so on, and it gave output for <tt  >df
-h</tt> (same as
mine) and <tt  >cat /proc/mdstat</tt> (the same except for md4, as mine is a single
disk 1TB). Everything seems to check out except the presence of the gcc
compiler. Any help with my problem would be so appreciated, and a follow-up
MyBook article also would be great.

The WDG1NC10000N is a single-drive &ldquo;Blue LED&rdquo; WD Mybook World Edition,
and it has hardware matching what is described in the article.
</p><p>
Your trouble arises from the 2.x firmware. Although the 1.x firmware
versions include the full GCC toolchain, I recently upgraded one of my
devices and found that GCC is missing in the more recent firmware.
</p><p>
I ignore the reason for the change (indeed, Western Digital endorsed
direct access to Linux in the latest &ldquo;White LED&rdquo; devices, where root ssh
access can be configured straight off the Web interface), but you have
two options for recovery: heading over to the MyBook Community Wiki
(<a href="http://mybookworld.wikidot.com/forum/t-50241/tutorial:how-to-recover-gcc-after-firmware-2-00-15-upgrade" target="_self">mybookworld.wikidot.com/forum/t-50241/tutorial:how-to-recover-gcc-after-firmware-2-00-15-upgrade</a>)
for recovery instructions would be the first. The alternative is for you
to build a cross-compiling toolchain, which is more involved but certainly
convenient, as this way you can build your software for beefier machines.
If you choose this latter approach, O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Embedded Linux
Systems</em></span> is your best introduction.
</p><p>
I also want to note that ipkg (<a href="http://mybookworld.wikidot.com/optware" target="_self">mybookworld.wikidot.com/optware</a>)
is on its way to the MyBook. Look for prebuilt packages
before you rebuild everything yourself.
</p><p>
There is certainly more that can be said in the subject. I will
consider a follow-up article if the interest is there.

Squid Correction</h4><p>
I've been waiting for the last installment of Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Building a
Secure Squid Web Proxy&rdquo; series [see the May through August 2009 Paranoid
Penguin columns] since it was
announced back in the April issue. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is one of the magazines I
read from front to back, and I enjoy it.
</p><p>
I noticed a couple errors in the last article of the series [August 2009]. One is in the instructions to
install the blacklists with the --strip argument for the tar command. The
code states --strip 1 and the explanation states --strip 2. The other
error is in the &ldquo;Configuring Squid to Use squidGuard&rdquo; section at the end of
the fourth paragraph. The last word should be changed from
url_rewrite_program to url_rewrite_children.
</p><p>
One more feature that could be added to this series is how to configure
squid as a transparent proxy. I think that a lot of us use Linux or other
*nix systems as a firewall to protect home or other networks. When using a
transparent proxy, there is no need to configure browsers. There is also
protection from other applications that might be accessing banned sites.
Keep up the good work.

A Suggestion
</h4><p>
I have been a subscriber for a long time. If you must cover proprietary
products as well, please go right ahead. But, the least you can do when
you write such an article is to mention the license in a little space under
the title, or at least mention there whether a product is FLOSS or not; it will
save many readers like me the time we spend finding out the same for ourselves.
</p><p>
Even if I were not philosophically opposed to proprietary products,
installing third-party products on my servers is more pain in the long run
than it's worth, not to mention a security risk.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dave   <br><br>
</p><p>
Great suggestion. We'll do our best to clarify licenses when dealing with
products.&mdash;Ed.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> Correction
</h4><p>
Your pipeline of tr and grep has the unintended consequence
of eliminating any words that contain, are followed, or are
preceded by punctuation [see Dave Taylor's &ldquo;Looking More Closely at
Letter and Word Usage&rdquo; in the August 2009 issue]. This is not an insignificant number,
as it eliminates the last word of every sentence and comma-separated clauses,
plus the first and last word of quotations,
contractions and hyphenated words.
</p><p>
Using the alternative pipeline, I mentioned a few issues back [see the July
2009 Letters section]:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs '[:lower:]' '\n'
</pre>
</p><p>
the word count of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> text increased by more
than 20%.
</p><p>
However, this pipeline results in a different error. Contractions,
such as o'clock and didn't, get split into multiple words. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> text contains many unusual contractions such as y'are,
Ye'll, a'hidin' and gard'ners. Some strange words result when
they are split.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jon   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
You're talking about this code snippet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat dracula.txt | tr ' ' '\
' | grep -v '[^[:alpha:]]' | grep -v "^$"
</pre>
</p><p>
And you're exactly right. I can't believe I didn't notice that! Thanks for
the correction, Jon!
