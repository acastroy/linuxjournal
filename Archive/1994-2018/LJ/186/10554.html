Check out a few simple spam-fighting tweaks to two of my favorite
open-source programs: mutt and Postfix.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd93b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When you think about it, all spam really is, is hacked ham. This is true
for both meanings of the word. In the food sense, it is composed of
hacked-up bits of pork that are reassembled to resemble (sort of) ham. In
the e-mail sense, spam is just hacked-up bits of text that are reassembled
so they somewhat resemble a legitimate e-mail you want to read (ham).
</p><p>
Countless articles talk about the open-source tools you can
use to reduce the amount of spam in your inbox, so I'm not going to write
yet another article about SpamAssassin, Razor/Pyzor, Spam Blackhole Lists
(SBLs) or even grey-listing, although I recommend looking into those
countermeasures if you haven't already done so. Instead, I
assume you already have these measures in place, so I'm
going to discuss a few extra tools that make spam management a bit more,
well, manageable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd95c0"></a>
Virtual Addresses in Postfix</h2></div></div><p>
I'm not a huge fan of Web-based e-mail, although for the longest time, I did
think it was a great tool for spam-catching. I would set up a free Web
e-mail account, and whenever I bought something on-line, I used that e-mail
address as a contact. Of course, whenever I bought something new, I'd have
to go into the account first and purge the mountain of spam that had
accumulated since the last time I used the account. The other downside was
that I still never knew which companies had sold out my e-mail address and
which ones kept it protected.
</p><p>
Since then, I've found an even better solution with virtual addresses in
Postfix. Now that I run my own mail server, I can set up as many e-mail
addresses as I want for free and have them all land in the same inbox. Not
only does this make it easier to find all my on-line receipts later, but also
because of the 
way I set it up, I easily can find out which companies sold me out and block
only their e-mail messages.
</p><p>
Virtual addresses in Postfix work much like aliases work in most mail
servers. It provides you a way to set up a large series of To addresses
that your mail server will accept and map those addresses to one or more real
addresses on the server, or even forward e-mail to addresses on a completely
different server. All you have to do is set up a new database that defines
the mapping between virtual and real addresses, and then tell Postfix to
use it.
</p><p>
For this example, let's assume I have a mail server that already accepts
mail for example.net, and my personal account is kyle@example.net. Whenever
I set up a new account, either on a social network or an on-line
retailer (anything that could potentially send me spam), I set up a new
virtual address named after them and the year. Let's assume I created an
account on CompanyX's site, so I could buy a T-shirt and also registered a
new profile on TweetBookSpace&mdash;the new hip social-networking-meets-cell-phones-meets-LOLcats site.
</p><p>
First, I would create a regular text file called /etc/postfix/virtual that
contained the following entries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# System accounts that should exist
kyle@example.net                  kyle@localhost
root@example.net                  kyle@localhost

# Spam-catching accounts
companyx2009@example.net          kyle@localhost
tweetbookspace2009@example.net    kyle@localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
All of the addresses in the left column correspond to addresses for which 
Postfix will accept mail, and the right column tells Postfix to which real
account to forward the mail. Instead of an @localhost address, I 
also could forward it to some other external e-mail address, or even list
multiple addresses separated by commas. Once I set up the file and
whenever I make any changes, I need to run the postmap command against it,
so that it creates the custom database file Postfix actually will read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo postmap /etc/postfix/virtual
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I just need to add some new lines to my /etc/postfix/main.cf to define
what domains I will use for my virtual aliases and tell it to use the file
I just created. I added only one domain here, but if you already have
multiple domains defined in your mydestination line, move as many as you
want managed by this file over to the virtual_alias_domains setting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
virtual_alias_domains = example.net
virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I can run <tt  >sudo postfix reload</tt> to reload my settings. If I start to
notice that I'm getting spam sent to companyx2009@example.net, all I
have to do to block that address is comment out that line in
/etc/postfix/virtual and run postmap again. Although it's not necessary to
add the year to the e-mail address, I've found that helps when I periodically
go through my old throwaway e-mail addresses and comment them out&mdash;after
all, I always can uncomment them the next time I want to order something.

Spam Tips for Mutt Users</h2></div></div><p>
I know plenty of people use whiz-bang
graphical e-mail programs, and many of them also have fancy buttons and icons
that flash when e-mail might be spam. Well, if you didn't already know from
my prior columns, I'm a big fan of mutt, and I didn't want to be left out of
all these fancy spam-managing techniques. Once again, mutt's powerful
customization comes to the rescue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd9c48"></a>
Colorize Borderline Spam</h2></div></div><p>
Although I do have spam filters set up on my personal account, sometimes
messages get through my defenses. It's always a delicate balancing act
when you tweak your spam thresholds, so I not only wanted to see how close
spam that made it through was to the threshold, but I also wanted to know if any of
my legitimate e-mail was close.
</p><p>
I have SpamAssassin configured so that it adds the score to my e-mail
headers via the custom X-Spam-Status header. Let's say that my spam
threshold was a score of 6; I then set up two rules: one to color any
messages with a score of 2 or 3 red and another to color messages with a
score of 4 or 5 bright red. That way, both types of messages would stand
out&mdash;especially the messages right on the tip of my threshold. Here are
the folder-hook rules I added to my mutt config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
folder-hook . "color index red default '~h 
 &#8618;\"X-Spam-Status:.*score=(2|3)\.\"'"
folder-hook . "color index brightred default '~h 
 &#8618;\"X-Spam-Status:.*score=(4|5)\.\"'"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, like many people, I have a special spam folder set aside so I can train
SpamAssassin. I go in there from time to time to look for any false
positives, so I also wanted to highlight any messages that were right
above the threshold. The following rule colors any messages that have
a score of 6, 7 or 8 magenta:

<pre     class="programlisting">
folder-hook . "color index magenta default '~h
 &#8618;\"X-Spam-Status:.*score=(6|7|8)\.\"'"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd9eb0"></a>
Quick Macro to Save to the Spam Folder</h2></div></div><p>
Now, whenever I go through my inbox and see a message with a suspicious
Subject line, if I notice it's colored red or bright red, I might not even
bother to open it. Because I know it's close to the threshold, I simply can 
move it to my spam folder. In mutt, you can do this with just a few
keystrokes, but of course, that doesn't stop me from automating it a bit
further. After all, why do a few keystrokes when I can bind the S key to
save to my spam folder automatically? All I had to do was add the
following to my mutt config:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# make S automatically save spam to the spam folder
macro index	S "simaps://mail.example.net/INBOX.spam"
macro pager	S "simaps://mail.example.net/INBOX.spam"
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, change <tt  >imaps://mail.example.net/INBOX.spam</tt> so that it points to
the spam folder on your IMAP server, but once you do, you either can press S
to save an individual message to the spam folder or you can tag all of the
spam in your inbox with the T key, and press ;S to save it all to the spam
folder at once. 
</p><p>
Sure, it would be great if we never had any spam to begin with, but although
I can choose what canned food I buy at the grocery store, I may never fully get
rid of spam in my inbox. After all, one man's hacked-up pork by-product
is another man's tasty canned-ham substitute. If people didn't order
those male-enhancement pills, they wouldn't advertise them. At least with
a few extra steps, I can make managing spam take less time.
