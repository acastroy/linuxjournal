As I write this month's column, I'm getting ready to attend DEFCON,
my all-time favorite information security conference and hacker
rave party. I'll catch up with treasured Known Associates, attend
cutting-edge technical presentations and drink Sam Adams beer two-fisted
at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacker Jeopardy</em></span> (it's a tough job, but I'm up to it).
</p><p>
And, at some point, I'll engage in two closely related activities:
connecting my laptop to the DEFCON WLAN (wireless local-area network)
to check e-mail, hoping fervently that I won't do anything dumb enough
to expose my passwords or other personal information to the thousands
of other mischievous punks connected to the DEFCON WLAN, and I'll have
a nervous chuckle or two at the Wall of Sheep, a real-time list of WLAN
users who have done something dumb enough to expose their passwords and
other personal information to the thousands of mischievous punks on the
DEFCON WLAN.
</p><p>
There isn't necessarily that much shame in ending up on the Wall of Sheep.
Several years ago it happened to none other than world-renowned security
expert Winn Schwartau. I should mention that Winn was a very good sport
about it, too&mdash;no identity theft, no foul, as they say.
</p><p>
But, that doesn't mean I'm quite ready to put my own reputation on the
line without a fight. You can bet that before I board the plane for Las
Vegas, I'm going to lock my laptop <span   class="emphasis"><em>down</em></span>, and when I'm
there, I'm
going to take care of myself like I was back home in the hood, on the
wrong side of the tracks, after dark, with a pork chop hung around my
neck. Nobody's going to pwn Mick at DEFCON this year without busting
out some <span   class="emphasis"><em>supernatural</em></span> kung fu.
(I hope.)
</p><p>
So what, you may ask, does any of this have to do with those of you who never
go to DEFCON and generally stick to your friendly local coffee shop
wireless hotspots and neighborhood cable-modem LAN segment? Actually,
I think that question pretty much answers itself, but I'll spell it
out for you: the tips and techniques I use to navigate the DEFCON WLAN
safely with my trusty Linux laptop should amply suffice to protect
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> on whatever public, semiprivate or spectacularly hostile
networks to which you may find yourself having to connect.
</p><p>
This month's column is about ruthlessly practical Linux desktop
security&mdash;what to do to harden your system proactively and, even more
important, what to avoid doing in order to keep it out of harm's way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc7b988"></a>
Overview and Generalities</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a summary of what I'm about to impart:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Keep fully patched.
</p></li><li><p>
Turn off all unnecessary network listeners or uninstall them altogether.
</p></li><li><p>
Harden your Web browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Never do anything important in clear text. Actually, do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span>
in clear text.
</p></li><li><p>
Use VPN software for optimal imperviousness.
</p></li><li><p>
Pay attention to SSL certificate errors.
</p></li><li><p>
Be careful with Webmail and surf carefully in general.
</p></li><li><p>
Make backups before you travel.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Some of those things should be extremely familiar to my regular readers,
or simple common sense, or both. Patching, for example, is both critically
important and blazingly obviously so. Most network attacks begin with
a vulnerable piece of software. Minimizing the number of known bugs
running on your system is arguably the single-most important thing you
can do to secure it.
</p><p>
I'll leave it to you to use the auto-update tools on your Linux
distribution of choice, and the same goes for making backups, an equally obvious
(though important) piece of advice.
</p><p>
At least equally important is minimizing the number of software
applications that accept network connections. If a given application
either is turned off or has been uninstalled, it generally doesn't
matter whether it's vulnerable or not. (Unless, of course, an attacker
can enable a vulnerable application for purposes of privilege escalation,
which is one reason you should not only disable but also remove unnecessary
applications.) I cover service disabling in depth later in this article.
</p><p>
So far, so obvious. But, what about antivirus software? As a matter of
fact, and by the way I'm waiting for someone to convince me otherwise
on this, viruses and worms are not a threat I take very seriously on
Linux. In all my years using and experimenting with Linux, including
in university lab settings and in my own Internet-facing DMZ networks,
I never have had a single malware infection on any Linux system I ran
or administered.
</p><p>
Is this because there are no Linux worms or viruses, or because Mick
is so fabulously elite? No, on both counts. Rather, it's because I've
never been lazy about keeping current with patches, and because I've
always very stubbornly used plain text for all my e-mail.
</p><p>
Worms exploit vulnerable network applications&mdash;no vulnerability (or no
app), no worm. E-mail viruses depend on users executing e-mail attachments
or on their e-mail software's running scripts embedded in HTML-formatted
e-mail&mdash;no attachment executing or script running, no infection.
</p><p>
I've also been lucky in this regard because there are few Linux worms
and viruses in the wild to begin with. But, even if there were more, I
would repeat, <span   class="emphasis"><em>keeping current with patching and using e-mail carefully
is more important than running antivirus software</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc7c3d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What about Targeted Malware?</b></p><p>
I don't want you to come away from this with the notion that malware
<span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> figures into Linux security or that it never
will. In
settings where you can't control what software people run or install
on their systems or can't fully enforce automated, timely patching,
good antivirus software is essential.
</p><p>
And, I worry quite a bit about targeted malware&mdash;that is, hostile
code that has been custom created to attack a specific organization
or individual. That is becoming an increasingly common tool used
by organized crime in stealing large quantities of sensitive data
(most typically credit-card numbers and identity data) from specific
organizations. Often, the worm or virus will be &ldquo;planted&rdquo; in the target
network by someone with inside access.
</p><p>
Because a given worm, virus or trojan of this type has been
&ldquo;handcrafted&rdquo;
and never has been released against the general public, there's zero
likelihood that any antivirus software vendor even will know about it,
let alone provide antivirus signatures that can detect it. Mainstream,
signature-based antivirus software is, therefore, generally useless against
targeted malware. For this and other reasons, targeted malware is very,
very difficult to defend against, even with good patching practices.
</p><p>
But, this article isn't about protecting large networks or even about
defending yourself from targeted attacks by well-funded attackers. It's
about protecting yourself from attacks by more or less random strangers
you may encounter on the Internet, at your local coffee shop's wireless
LAN and so forth. And in those contexts, I don't worry very much about
Linux malware.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc7c7f8"></a>
Turning Off Network Listeners</h2></div></div><p>
So, assuming you're fully patched already&mdash;and I assure you I
am&mdash;let's get busy disabling network listeners. The first step in
doing this
is to <span   class="emphasis"><em>find</em></span> them. If I run the command
<tt  >netstat --inet -al</tt> on my
Ubuntu laptop, I see what is shown in Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc7ca08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

You can see I'm running the Swat front end for administering Samba
services, the Secure Shell d&aelig;mon, the Internet Printing Protocol and
Squid (whose default port is TCP 3128). Hmm, you'd never guess that I
recently wrote articles on Samba and Squid, would you?
</p><p>
Well, those articles are long finished, so right now I don't have any
compelling reason to keep <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> of these services running, especially
when I travel. I not only need to shut them down, but also disable their
startup scripts. I could simply uninstall them, but I might need them
later. Still, as a general rule, if you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> uninstall unnecessary
software, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span>. Doing so via your preferred package manager
is simple enough for me to skip describing here.
</p><p>
At the application level, I can use Swat to shut down Samba cleanly. This
clobbers the netbios nameservice (netbios-ns) and netbios datagram
(netbios-dgm) udp listeners in Listing 1. But, I also need to disable
the Samba startup scripts and Swat itself.
</p><p>
Distributions vary in how they handle startup scripts for system d&aelig;mons
like these. On SUSE, you can use YaST2 or the command
<tt  >insserv</tt>. On Red
Hat, Fedora and CentOS systems, use the command
<tt  >chkconfig</tt>.
</p><p>
Because my system runs Ubuntu, I can use either the Services Settings
applet (Figure 1) in my X Window System's Applications menu or the update-rc.d
command. Let's start with the Services Settings applet, which, by the
way, is part of GNOME and, therefore, may very well be installed on your
non-Ubuntu GNOME desktop too.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10563f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. GNOME Services Applet
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows the Services Settings applet after I've already clicked the
Unlock button and provided my root password. Figure 1 also shows the
bottom of the list of services running on my system, but that's where
some of the juicier items are. I definitely want to uncheck the boxes
next to Proxy cache service (squid), Remote shell server (ssh) and
Web server (apache2).
</p><p>
What about Printer service (cups)? I'll disable that too, because at
DEFCON, it's highly unlikely I'll need to print anything (or even have
the opportunity to). But, note that as Listing 1 shows, my system is
listening only for incoming IPP connections on the loopback interface
(localhost:ipp). It isn't listening for remote connections to this
service.
</p><p>
Me being me, I'll disable it anyhow. A &ldquo;local&rdquo; attack vector is 
local only until some <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> process is hijacked by a remote attacker,
at which point the hijacked process might be used to spawn some other
process that can attach to the thing having the &ldquo;local&rdquo; vulnerability.
</p><p>
Along the same lines&mdash;that is, in the interests of generalized
paranoia&mdash;I'll also disable the following in Services Settings (not shown in
Figure 1):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Account information resolver (winbind).
</p></li><li><p>
Folder sharing service (samba).
</p></li><li><p>
Multicast DNS service discovery (avahi-daemon).
</p></li><li><p>
Network service (xinetd).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Those are all things I'm sure I can live without in an untrusted
environment. File sharing in particular, in the form of Samba and its
winbind service, is to be avoided in such settings. Now if I re-run my
<tt  >netstat --inet -al</tt> command, I see only what is shown
in Listing 2.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc74058"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

udp        0      0 *:bootpc            *:*
</pre></div><p>
Not bad! Listing 2 shows that by clicking two buttons in the Swat
interface and unchecking some boxes in the Services Setting applet,
I've clobbered 11 out of the 13 network listeners that previously
had been active on my system.
</p><p>
But, I'm not done with listeners yet. There still are two left. I can't
do much about bootpc, which is part of the dhcp client d&aelig;mon that
most of us use to configure low-level TCP/IP settings automatically
when we connect to a LAN. Even at DEFCON, I'll need dhcpcd (bootpc)
active in order to connect to the DEFCON WLAN.
</p><p>
Swat, on the other hand, is fair game to shut down, especially considering
I've disabled all the <span   class="emphasis"><em>rest</em></span> of Samba. But hold on a second, I've
forgotten how! There's neither a Swat entry anywhere in the Services
Settings applet nor any applicable script in /etc/init.d. Maybe I can
figure out the name of the actual process listening on the Swat port
using the lsof (list open files) command, as shown in Listing 3.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc74420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
Oh, now I remember! Swat is run by inetd, which on Ubuntu systems is part
of the package openbsd-inetd. You may remember my disabling xinetd in
Services Settings, but openbsd-inetd's startup script has to be disabled
manually, the old-school Debian way (Listing 4).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc746e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

In Listing 4, you can see that I first stopped openbsd-inetd via its

/etc/rc0.d, etc/rc1.d and so forth, via the update-rc.d command. I can
undo all this later, as shown in Listing 5.

Obviously, I will need to make note of the sequence number (in
this example, 20 for both the start and kill links) and the runlevels
(2&ndash;5 for starting and 0, 1 and 6 for killing). As it happens, the
settings for openbsd-inetd also are Ubuntu's defaults, so I could use
the command <tt  >sudo update-rc.d openbsd-inetd defaults</tt> when re-enabling
that particular service.
</p><p>
I've spent the bulk of this column shutting down network services. Is
that all there is to system hardening?
</p><p>
Ordinarily not. If we were talking about a server, we'd have a lot more
work to do: configuring individual applications for maximum security,
disabling unnecessary user accounts, tightening file permissions,
configuring an integrity checker such as tripwire, maybe creating a
local iptables firewall script and so forth.
</p><p>
But this is my personal laptop, a single-user system. Shutting down and
disabling unnecessary network listeners really is 90% of what I need to
do to &ldquo;harden&rdquo; it. Most of the rest of what I need to do concerns how
I <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> this system. Before I get to that, however, I need to harden
one killer application: my Web browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc74e18"></a>
Hardening Firefox</h2></div></div><p>
Firefox's default security settings are surprisingly okay. Personally,
however, I prefer to disable third-party cookies (which admittedly breaks
some sites), and sometimes I temporarily turn third-party cookies back
on. I also like to turn off my browsing history completely. I don't
need to know where I've been, and neither does anybody else. Figure 2
shows these privacy settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10563f2.large.jpg"><img src="10563f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Firefox Privacy Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Under Firefox's Security settings, I certainly want to make sure Firefox's
default warnings for add-on installations, suspected forgeries and other
suspected hostile sites are intact. I also turn off all
password caching&mdash;the very idea of allowing my browser to store passwords is, if you
ask me, the way of tears. Figure 3 shows these settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10563f3.large.jpg"><img src="10563f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Firefox Security Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, I should mention a couple useful Firefox add-ons. I swear by
Adblock Plus, which enforces a blacklist of known Web advertisement sites
whose content is frequently streamed to various other sites. Blocking
those sites effectively blocks in-line ads. You can get Adblock Plus
by searching for &ldquo;adblock plus&rdquo; in Firefox's Get add-ons tool, under
Tools&rarr;Add-ons.
</p><p>
I realize this breaks various people's Internet revenue streams, but I
use Adblock Plus less for aesthetic or performance reasons (ad-blocking
certainly shortens Web site load times) than for security. Blocking
ads reduces the attack surfaces of the sites you visit and, therefore,
reduces your chances of being exposed to spyware or other hostile
content.
</p><p>
It may be difficult for a given Web hacker to compromise
nytimes.com directly, but it's considerably easier to compromise one or more advertisers
whose content is loaded in tandem with http://www.nytimes.com. Personally,
I'm less worried about destroying Internet ad revenue than I am about
protecting my humble browser.
</p><p>
(Before I forget to mention it, you should minimize the number of
unfamiliar sites you visit in the first place when using an untrusted
network for the very same reason.)
</p><p>
Finally, the Firefox add-on Ghostery allows you to see what Web bugs
(trackers), ad feeds and other hidden scripts are active on each Web
site you visit. For most such scripts, Ghostery can tell you from whence
it originates and why you should or shouldn't worry about it. You can
get Ghostery at <a href="http://www.ghostery.com" target="_self">www.ghostery.com</a>.
</p><p>
Now that Ubuntu and Firefox are hardened for DEFCON use, here are
some things I'll do when actually connected to that wicked DEFCON WLAN
to minimize my chances of ending up on the Wall of Sheep.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xc75600"></a>
Never Transmit Unencrypted Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
Always, always assume somebody can and will eavesdrop on all network
traffic. Whether you personally can believe or imagine how they'll do
this or not is unimportant&mdash;it's the attacker's imagination and skill
that matter here, not yours. The only sensible assumption for you to
make about the network's integrity is that there isn't any, and that
someone can see all traffic going to and from your system. Accordingly,
you must not log on to any remote system through any unencrypted protocol.
</p><p>
Telnet, non-anonymous FTP, IMAP, POP3 and any browser-based login
involving an http:// URL rather than https://, therefore, are all
off limits. In the modern era, all these applications (remote shell,
file transfer, e-mail and most Web applications) can and should be used
in encrypted implementations, such as SSH, FTPS or SFTP, IMAPS, POP3S
and https, at least for logons and other sensitive transactions.

Use VPN</h2></div></div><p>
If your home or corporate network supports it, use a strong VPN protocol
such as IPsec or SSL-VPN to connect back, and do all your Web surfing
and other Internet business via the home network. Yes, this will degrade
the performance and speed of your Web-surfing experience; however, it will
all but obliterate risks associated with eavesdropping, DNS spoofing,
evil twinning and similar attacks (although, of course, if your home or
corporate network is targeted further downstream from the hostile LAN
you're connected to locally, those downstream attacks
<span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> apply).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xf88eb8"></a>
Care about SSL Certificates</h2></div></div><p>
When using any public, hostile or otherwise untrusted network, you must
pay careful attention to your browser's padlock icon. If there is any
problem with any certificate being presented by an SSL-protected site
you've had no issues connecting to in the past, you should assume that
somebody is attempting a man-in-the-middle, proxy or imposter Web site
attack.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb83580.0xf88fc0"></a>
Be Careful with Webmail and On-line Banking</h2></div></div><p>
Gmail, Yahoo, Windows Live (Hotmail) and on-line banking sites are
all particularly likely for someone to attempt to proxy or spoof. If
you must visit such a site from a hostile LAN, again, watch for any
certificate weirdness.
</p><p>
If you have your own Webmail server or have access to Webmail from a
smaller provider, such as a regional ISP, those may be less likely for
someone to attempt to spoof or proxy than one of the &ldquo;big
guys&rdquo;. For
maximum paranoia though, using a strong VPN connection really is best.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And with that, we're out of space for this month, but we're done! If I
say so myself, it wasn't a bad column's work. My laptop is now hardened
for DEFCON WLAN use, and you've hopefully learned a thing or two about
Mick's brutally pragmatic approach to desktop security. We'll see whether
I end up on the Wall of Sheep this year (if so, maybe I'll admit it,
and maybe I won't). Good luck with your own public LAN adventures!
