Back when we were creating the editorial calendar for 2009 and decided on
&ldquo;Hack This&rdquo; as the topic for October, I think our
resident Hack &amp; / columnist Kyle Rankin thought that issue was going to
be dedicated completely to him. (Either
that, or he was a bit worried we'd make him write every single article in the
issue.) As it turns out, neither was true. I considered telling him we
needed enough content from him this month to fill the magazine, but to be
honest, Kyle scares me a bit. So, I saved my joking for this
piece.
</p><p>
Just because our Hack Editor didn't write every jot and title this month
doesn't mean we won't leave as better hackers. Duilio J. Protti gets us going
with low-level system programming, but we don't use an actual system. Thanks
to KVM, we learn low-level system hacking on a virtual machine. Virtual
machines are so robust nowadays, the concepts and practices will work on a
real system too. If software hacking isn't enough for you, fear not. Marco
Fioretti shows us some actual hardware hacking with
Field Programmable Gate Arrays. You won't need to break out a soldering
iron, but it'll just about feel like it!
</p><p>
If all this system hacking sounds fun, but you're worried your proprietary
computer BIOS will hinder your skills, Anton Borisov might be just the man
you want to listen to. He shows us the ins and outs of coreboot (you may
know it as LinuxBIOS). Although flashing the firmware on off-the-shelf
routers might be second nature, not too many of us have ventured into BIOS
flashing. It seems a perfect fit for this issue.
</p><p>
If you've hacked your computer so that it bends to your every whim, you
definitely want it to look cool as well. Sure, Compiz on your desktop will
draw oohs and ahhs from the occasional Windows user, but even Linux users
will be impressed if you implement Clutter in your programming. Clutter
allows you to add rich, GUI interfaces to your
applications quickly and easily. Alex Crits-Christoph demonstrates utilizing Clutter's
advanced toolkit. In fact, we've got a bunch of programming hacks this
month. Reuven M. Lerner talks more about testing with RSpec for
Rails, and Dave Taylor shows us some cool (and $RANDOM) Web server tricks.
</p><p>
And, of course, the &ldquo;Kyle Rankin&rdquo; issue wouldn't be complete without his
monthly Hack &amp; / column. This time, Kyle shows us his secret to
fighting spam (and its only slightly more palatable cousin,
e-mail ham) preemptively. We all have a handful of &ldquo;throw-away&rdquo; e-mail addresses we use
when signing up for something on-line, but Kyle uses a different address
every single time. So while Kyle shows us how to keep unwanted things out
of our inboxes, his buddy Bill Childers demonstrates how to put things we
might want (namely Android) in some bizarre places. A few months back when
the editorial team was talking about content for this issue, I challenged
him to install Android on his Netbook. He rose to the challenge, and not
only got Android running on his Netbook, but also on a Windows Mobile
phone!
</p><p>
We have a full lineup of articles on other topics as well. Whether you are
looking for desktop security tips from Mick Bauer, new product information
from James Gray or a rally cry to take over the Internet from Doc Searls,
you're gonna love his issue. Heck, even I get into the hacking act with
Google Voice. You might be able to get unlimited minutes on your cell phone
thanks to a handy little trick with your free GV phone number. So for this
month, we all got to be hacks. You can too. And if you become a hacker,
don't worry, we won't tell Kyle. We wouldn't want him to get jealous.
