Let's hack an open Internet, starting at home.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3b358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You can only hack what's hackable. We owe Linux to the fact that operating
systems are hackable, and that they can run on common hardware, much of which
is also hackable. We also owe Linux to the Internet, which is a hack on
wiring and data trafficking.
</p><p>
For PCs and mobile devices, Linux is a defaulted choice. It's at GandhiCon 4.
That and the first three GandhiCons are implicit in the Mohandas Gandhi
quote, &ldquo;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you,
then you win.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The Internet, however, is another matter. The Internet Protocol (IP) arrived
at GandhiCon 4 by 1981 (with IPv4). That's because it was created as what we
might call a public protocol, connecting devices using just about any kind of
network wiring, hardware and data link protocols (Ethernet, Token Ring,
FDDI and so on), without prejudice. This made it easy and cheap for anybody to use.
</p><p>
By design, the Internet Protocol was decentralized. It reduced network
complexity inside the network as far as possible, while relying on
intelligence at its end nodes. It was even agnostic toward addressing
schemes, leaving choices up to implementations at higher levels in the stack
and resolution up to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
</p><p>
Alas, what most people know best about the Internet is not its decentralized,
depoliticized and free (as in both freedom and beer) public nature, but
rather its centralized, politicized and costly (as in both freedom and beer)
private one. This is the Internet of domain names that are privately owned
(actually, rented), controlled by a central naming authority (the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN) and filled with
&ldquo;pipes&rdquo; mostly owned by private interests and highly cartelized. This is not
an Internet to which we can simply connect. Instead, it's one we can
&ldquo;access&rdquo; only 
through Internet Service Providers&mdash;a class of businesses that was born
when small independent companies found ways to make the Internet available to
anybody with a land line and has since become the tertiary service of
phone and cable companies selling &ldquo;broadband&rdquo; or
&ldquo;high-speed Internet&rdquo; as the
third act in a &ldquo;triple play&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Although the former Internet is hackable, the latter one is not.
</p><p>
As it happens, I've been living in the hackproof hell of the private,
centralized Internet for the last two weeks, during which time my home
connection here in Santa Barbara has been intermittently plagued by high
latencies and packet losses. My ping and traceroute tests clearly isolate the
problem somewhere between my cable modem and the first IP address my packets
encounter: a gateway downtown that's also owned by the cable company. Cable
company technicians that have come to my house (four so far) have excused
from blame my cable modem and all wiring between it and the service pole.
They know the problem is somewhere in their system. They still have not
solved it, and neither can I, even with help from many friends far geekier than
myself.
</p><p>
So here is a radical proposition. Let's build the Internet we want&mdash;a free,
open and hackable Internet&mdash;from the outside in.
</p><p>
This is something Bob Frankston has been advocating for many years. What Bob
wants is simple connectivity between any points floating on the vast resource
he calls our &ldquo;sea of bits&rdquo;. His latest label for this is
&ldquo;ambient
connectivity&rdquo;. In his essay &ldquo;Opportunity for
Innovation&rdquo;, Bob writes, &ldquo;Once we
can assume connectivity we can start taking advantage of the opportunities.
It's not just about high-value applications like education, commerce and
entertainment. It's about basic infrastructure. We won't discover the real
value until we've had a chance to experience ambient connectivity.&rdquo; In a
follow-up essay titled &ldquo;Zero Marginal Cost&rdquo;, he adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The idea that we can create our own solutions using raw, unreliable bits is
at the heart of the Internet's generativity....
</p><p>
We've already seen the power of zero marginal cost. It was the availability
of unmeasured local phone service that gave the United States the lead in
adopting the Internet in the 1990s. We rejected digital phone service
because the phone companies chose to charge a premium for that service. We
just worked around it using modems because there was zero marginal cost for
using the existing infrastructure.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Bob's model of the Internet is home networking, expanded outward through
converging communities. In my interview with Bob for the March 2008 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10033" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10033</a>), he said, &ldquo;The networks in our homes are a good example. You
'just' print without worry about negotiating for the printing
provider.&rdquo;
</p><p>
As it happens, I'm also shopping for home networking gear&mdash;in
particular, for a
router/switch to connect the 16 Ethernet jacks scattered about the
house. Cat-6 wiring runs from each of those jacks to a patch panel in a
wiring closet. The cable company's modem is in there too.
</p><p>
Lemme tell ya, if there's a category ripe for disruption, it's home
networking. I've been looking at Belkin, Cisco/Linksys, D-Link, Netgear and
others&mdash;none of which are especially helpful. The 8-port device I'm replacing
is a Netgear router/switch that was billed as a &ldquo;VPN
Firewall&rdquo; but failed at
the essentials: its gears were stripped by the cable company's new 20Mb
downstream data speeds.
</p><p>
So let's look at making the Net hackable from the outside in. VCs always
are asking about market size and &ldquo;pain points&rdquo; in need of relief. I can't think
of a bigger, or more ideally hackable, pain than the one we find right at
home.
