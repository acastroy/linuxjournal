Self-Sovereign Identity</h4><p>
I always read Doc Searls' column, not to learn anything new but to try
to figure out what his point is. In the July 2016 issue, he introduces the
concept of &ldquo;self-sovereign identity&rdquo; with several obscure
sentences, and 
then, to take fuzzy thinking to a higher level, he quotes Devon Loffreto
with a paragraph of absolute gibberish. Here's one excerpt:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A self-Sovereign identity produces an administrative trail of data
relations that begin and resolve to individual humans.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And another:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A self-Sovereign identity is the root of all participation as a valued
social being within human societies of any type.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Now that's gibberish.
</p><p>
It's ironic that this column appears in a magazine that is so informative
otherwise.

<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> Phil, I try to bring up subjects, and make points,
that nobody else does. If some of that effort comes off as gibberish, at
least it beats silence.
</p><p>
Lots of original thinkers and authorities on topics don't make full
sense. But that doesn't mean what they say isn't worth listening
to, or de-bugging. That's why I followed the Devon Loffreto quote by
compressing his point down to &ldquo;only the individual has root for his or her
own source identity&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In a world where surveillance is the norm, I believe that insight can help
guide some necessary work. That's why I wrote this piece.

Tiny Internet&mdash;Test for CPU Extensions for Virtualization</h4><p>
I'm a bit behind in my reading, so I'm not sure if anyone else has commented
on this. In the May 2016 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> in John S.
Tonello's &ldquo;The Tiny Internet Project, Part I&rdquo;, he provides
instructions on seeing if the computer can support virtualization, but he
tests only for Intel's VT. Some individuals new to this may have AMD-based
systems (especially if they are using older hardware as AMD is not nearly
as popular as it once was). Anyway, it's always better not to assume
what the CPU is and do: <tt  >egrep '(vmx|svm)'
/proc/cpuinfo</tt> and instruct
users to make sure they have <span   class="emphasis"><em>either</em></span> vmx or svm in the output. Also,
don't forget that, again when using older PCs, some may not have 64-bit
capability so checking for &ldquo;lm&rdquo; in the output also is
important, and if
it isn't present, to use 32-bit distros. And finally, some virtualization
platforms require Execute Disable to be enabled, so users should check for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>either</em></span>
XD or NX in the output of /etc/cpuinfo.

<span   class="bold"><b>John S. Tonello replies:</b></span> You're absolutely right about AMD. Many of my
early machines were AMD-powered, albeit well before 64-bit was widely
available. Your tips are great for anyone looking to test their hardware
before proceeding with building a &ldquo;Tiny Internet&rdquo;. Thank you for sharing!
