One of the great works of geekdom is Neal Stephenson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>In the Beginning Was
the Command Line</em></span>, an essay-length book that came out in 1999
(<a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html" target="_self">www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html</a>). As with Linux,
the code was open. Still is. Here's one copy of the book's full text:
<a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/%7Eweis/info/commandline.html" target="_self">cristal.inria.fr/%7Eweis/info/commandline.html</a>. Though
many of Neal's references (for example, the Be operating system) are forgotten or
stale, his case for Linux (and its UNIX relatives) is as fresh and right
as ever. Here is the gist of it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The file systems of Unix machines all have the same general structure. On your
flimsy operating systems, you can create directories (folders) and give them
names like Frodo or My Stuff and put them pretty much anywhere you like. But
under Unix the highest level&mdash;the root&mdash;of the filesystem is always designated
with the single character &ldquo;/&rdquo; and it always contains the same set of top-level
directories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/usr
</p></li><li><p>
/etc
</p></li><li><p>
/var
</p></li><li><p>
/bin
</p></li><li><p>
/proc
</p></li><li><p>
/boot
</p></li><li><p>
/home
</p></li><li><p>
/root
</p></li><li><p>
/sbin
</p></li><li><p>
/dev
</p></li><li><p>
/lib
</p></li><li><p>
/tmp
</p></li></ul></div><p>
and each of these directories typically has its own distinct structure of
subdirectories. Note the obsessive use of abbreviations and avoidance of
capital letters; this is a system invented by people to whom repetitive stress
disorder is what black lung is to miners. Long names get worn down to
three-letter nubbins, like stones smoothed by a river.
</p><p>
This is not the place to try to explain why each of the above directories
exists, and what is contained in it. At first it all seems obscure; worse, it
seems deliberately obscure. When I started using Linux I was accustomed to
being able to create directories wherever I wanted and to give them whatever
names struck my fancy. Under Unix you are free to do that, of course (you are
free to do anything), but as you gain experience with the system you come to
understand that the directories listed above were created for the best of
reasons and that your life will be much easier if you follow along (within
/home, by the way, you have pretty much unlimited freedom).
</p><p>
After this kind of thing has happened several hundred or thousand times, the
hacker understands why Unix is the way it is, and agrees that it wouldn't be
the same any other way. It is this sort of acculturation that gives Unix
hackers their confidence in the system, and the attitude of calm, unshakable,
annoying superiority captured in the Dilbert cartoon. Windows 95 and MacOS are
products, contrived by engineers in the service of specific companies. Unix,
by contrast, is not so much a product as it is a painstakingly compiled oral
history of the hacker subculture. It is our Gilgamesh epic.
</p><p>
What made old epics like Gilgamesh so powerful and so long-lived was that they
were living bodies of narrative that many people knew by heart, and told over
and over again&mdash;making their own personal embellishments whenever it struck
their fancy. The bad embellishments were shouted down, the good ones picked up
by others, polished, improved, and, over time, incorporated into the story.
Likewise, Unix is known, loved, and understood by so many hackers that it can
be re-created from scratch whenever someone needs it. This is very difficult
to understand for people who are accustomed to thinking of OSes as things that
absolutely have to be bought. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, he did it on a NeXT machine,
which also had UNIX ancestors. But never mind that. What matters is that Tim
arranged the web's directory on the UNIX model: files were nested in
directories divided hierarchically by a series of slashes:
http://example.com/this/that/etc. The same hierarchy is also implicit in
client-server, which should have been called server-client, to reflect the
arrangement of status: server over client.
</p><p>
Between the directory path and client-server, what we've got is a mental model
of computing and networking that anchors all of computing's
civilization.
</p><p>
But it also gives us problems when it comes to conceiving and designing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>distributed</em></span> approaches, such as peer-to-peer. It gives us hierarchy after
hierarchy, and hierarchies within hierarchies, rather than the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>heterarchy</em></span> that
Paul Baran imagined the future internet to embody when he drew his diagram in
1964 (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed Networks
</p></div></div><p>
While we're at it, let's also revisit &ldquo;End-To-End Arguments in System
Design&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/%7Echuah/classes/eec273/eec273-w12/refs/SRC84-e2e.pdf" target="_self">www.ece.ucdavis.edu/%7Echuah/classes/eec273/eec273-w12/refs/SRC84-e2e.pdf</a>)
by David P. Reed, Jerome H. Saltzer and David D. Clark: a design guide
(<a href="http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/ANe2ecomment.html" target="_self">web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/endtoend/ANe2ecomment.html</a>) that
helped manifest and rationalize the internet protocol
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol</a>), which in an ideal world
would give us a fully distributed network (C, in Figure 1). Alas, the current
internet's implementation is closer to decentralized (B, in Figure 1). As
distributed networks go, it's good, but not good enough, because it still
subordinates client nodes to server ones, so servers get scale, while clients
get little more scale than the servers (and the operators of sphincters in the
network itself) allow. We also have a networked world where governments can
favor or ban traffic they don't like. Even society itself has to some degree
been re-organized and re-centralized by giant private &ldquo;social
networks&rdquo;, such
as Facebook and LinkedIn.
</p><p>
Back in April 2016, I suggested that our next fight is for freedom from exactly the
kind of centralized systems I just described
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/whats-our-next-fight" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/whats-our-next-fight</a>). Fighting for freedom would also
get us closer to each of these ideals:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
General-purpose computing and networking.
</p></li><li><p>
Decentralization and distributed everything.
</p></li><li><p>
Privacy.
</p></li><li><p>
The true Internet of Things.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now I suggest that we also need to free ourselves from the very mental models
that we used to build giant centralized traps from which we need to
escape.
</p><p>
There are positive signs. The blockchain, for all its faults, is distributed
by design. To come up with blockchain and Bitcoin (which uses a blockchain),
Satoshi Nakamoto (or whoever that really is) had to think outside of fiat
currency, banks, centralized trust systems and the other familiar boxes that
control transactions in the world's economies, nearly all of which are
centralized by design. He had to think of ways that a fully distributed
peer-to-peer approach to all those things would open possibilities and
outperform currency, payments and record-keeping done the old ways. One can
criticize Bitcoin and blockchain on many grounds, but what matters is that a
distributed system got imagined and implemented causing many other new
re-thinks and re-builds in the world.
</p><p>
The problem with mental models is that they work&mdash;also that we can't escape
the deepest ones that are anchored in our own experience as physical bodies,
operating in the physical world.
</p><p>
Ever wonder why good is up (or high) and bad is down (or low)? Why it is
easier to conceive of heaven in the sky and hell below the ground, than vice
versa? Or why light is good and dark is bad? Or why people say
&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;endarkened?&rdquo; Or why we &ldquo;catch&rdquo; or
&ldquo;grasp&rdquo; ideas? The answer is,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>because we are upright-walking diurnal animals with hands and opposable
thumbs</em></span>. If owls or moles were equipped by nature with the means to have moral
systems and speak about them, their metaphors would be radically different.
Dark might be good, and light might be bad.
</p><p>
We are embodied animals, and we can't get away from that fact. But we are also
inherently distributed, and different. At a base level, we are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>heterozygous</em></span>.
No two of us are the same, unless we are identical twins; and even then we are
separate and distinct individuals. (An interesting fact: so are apples. Writes
Michael Pollan in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Botany of Desire</em></span>, every seed in
every apple &ldquo;contains
the genetic instructions for a completely new and different apple tree, one
that, if planted, will bear only the most glancing resemblance to its
parents&rdquo;. All the varieties of Apple we know&mdash;Granny Smith, Delicious,
Macintosh&mdash;grow on trees that start as grafts off a single ancestral
plant.)
</p><p>
The designs we need are ones that appreciate our heterozygous inheritances,
and the fact that we are designed to learn throughout our healthy lives.
&ldquo;Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me&rdquo;, Walt Whitman advises. He
adds: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
Urge and urge and urge, 
Always the procreant urge of the world. 
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance.
Always substance and increase, always sex, 
Always a knit of identity, always distinction,
Always a breed of life.
</pre>
</p><p>
I love how Whitman puts those together, because none of them fits in a system,
other than one even he fails to comprehend, even as he embraces its mystery. I
also love &ldquo;knit of identity&rdquo;, because each life is a thread distinct in its
substance and capacity for increase, yet part of a whole that changes as well.
Every self, like every species, is a breed of life.
</p><p>
It is hard for computing to comprehend this, but not for the minds of people
programming and using computers.
</p><p>
Computing and programming require that we think of both in explicit ways, and
in explicit terms. Yet our knowledge of the world is mostly tacit. &ldquo;We know
more than we can tell&rdquo;, Michael Polanyi says, and that's a near absolute
understatement. It applies to everything we think and say. For example: even
if I've made full sense to you in this column so far, you probably won't be
able to repeat it back to me verbatim. And if you could, it would owe more to
memorization than comprehension. Short-term memory is an amazing grace of
human nature. It forces us to communicate meaning more than words. Consider
how often, in the midst of explaining something, we don't remember exactly how
we started the sentences we are now speaking, or exactly how we will finish
them, yet somehow we'll say what we mean, and others will understand it, even
though they can't repeat exactly what we said.
</p><p>
That's because, when we communicate with each other, we don't deliver an
explicit cache of words. Instead we cause meaning to form in the mind of
another person. Meaning is most of what we take away from any conversation.
The same goes for any course in school, any book or any experience. The meaning
we take is mostly tacit. It is also mostly unquestioned, once we make it our
own. 
</p><p>
Here's how I put it many years ago in a chapter of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open Sources
2.0</em></span>
(<a href="http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Open_Sources_2.0/Beyond_Open_Source:_Collaboration_and_Community/Making_a_New_World" target="_self">programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Open_Sources_2.0/Beyond_Open_Source:_Collaboration_and_Community/Making_a_New_World</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Several years ago I was talking with Tim O'Reilly about the discomfort we both
felt about treating information as a commodity. It seemed to us that
information was something more than, and quite different from, the
communicable form of knowledge. It was not a commodity, exactly, and was
insulted by the generality we call &ldquo;content&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Information, we observed, is derived from the verb <span   class="emphasis"><em>inform</em></span>, which is related to
the verb <span   class="emphasis"><em>form</em></span>. To inform is not to &ldquo;deliver
information&rdquo;, but rather, to form
the other party. If you tell me something I didn't know before, I am changed
by that. If I believe you and value what you say, I have granted you
authority, meaning I have given you the right to author what I know.
</p><p>
Therefore, <span   class="emphasis"><em>we are all authors of each other</em></span>. This is a profoundly human
condition in any case, but it is an especially important aspect of the open-source value system. By forming each other, as we also form useful software,
we are making the world, not merely changing it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So now look at authoring as something all of us do&mdash;or should be able to
do&mdash;all the time, in many more ways and contexts than our pyramidal
centralized systems would allow.
</p><p>
Consider the possible purposes of both our heterogeneousness and our enormous
capacity to communicate and learn, throughout our lives. Why are we that way?
Are those very human natures not insulted by systems built to subordinate
individuality to categories in databases? Is the full promise of heterarchy
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/opening-minds-spheres-among-us" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/opening-minds-spheres-among-us</a>) not a price we pay for making nothing but hierarchies, over and over again,
because that's what our tools and mental models are biased to do?
</p><p>
That we come in many colors, sizes and body shapes&mdash;all with different
faces that also change as we grow and age&mdash;is a grace meant to help us
recognize every person as distinctive and separate. Not just so we can typify
each other by any one of those characteristics. None of us is just black or
white, male or female, tall or short. We are sovereign selves with complete
souls that cannot be reduced to any one characteristic, no matter how easy it
is to do that, especially with research and computers.
</p><p>
I bring this up because I believe it is also worth considering that the best
case for distributed systems and networks is that they take advantage of the
countless differences and originalities among us. Distributed systems, more
than any other kind we can name&mdash;make possible recognizing that our
greatest resources are each other&mdash;and ourselves.
