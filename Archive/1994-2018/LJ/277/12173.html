Retro United Ltd.'s Write!</h2></div></div><p>
Even when you're sequestered in a monastery with nothing to do but
write, you still need a tool to record your thoughts. Realizing the
overabundance of bloatware out there&mdash;replete with features, icons,
templates, check boxes and other stuff that consumes screen space and
RAM&mdash;Retro United, Ltd., released Write!, a new distraction-free text
editor for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Write! is an elegant workspace
for any kind of writing, from notes to to-do lists, tweets and
novels&mdash;writing projects and texts of any kind. It has all the features of a good word
processor, notes Retro, packed into a clutter-free interface. Write! is
as functional as it is aesthetically pleasing with a minimalist design and
features a specialized focus mode for concentrating on a single paragraph
at a time. Write!'s publishing feature lets users quickly publish
their writing online for target readers&mdash;for example, Twitter
followers&mdash;and
a dark theme makes nighttime writing pleasant for the eyes.

Wibu-Systems CmASIC</h2></div></div><p>
Wibu-Systems describes the new generation of its CmASIC module as &ldquo;the
answer to the security-by-design needs of modern embedded computing
technology leaders&rdquo;. CmASIC is a module that Intelligent Device
Manufacturers (IDMs) can directly embed into their boards to provide
out-of-the box security and entitlement management. Security-by-design
leaves nothing to chance: the system is developed free from
vulnerabilities from the get-go and is impervious to attack. By soldering a
security module directly on to the board of the endpoint, the endpoint
is clearly identified, sensitive data (such as encryption keys,
production records and configuration schemes) is safeguarded, and the
module itself is accessible only by physically and logically tampering
with the endpoint. Integrating CmASIC is a snap, as the module is
delivered in a VQFN-32, 5x5mm chip-size package. On the software side,
CmASIC supports all mainstream operating systems via CodeMeter Embedded,
including Linux, MacOS and Windows for PCs, Embedded Linux and Windows
Embedded for embedded systems, Linux RT, VxWorks and QNX for RTOS,
and CODESYS, B&amp;R and Rockwell for PLCs.

G&aacute;bor Farkas' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical GIS</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
Open-source GIS tools are maturing rapidly, and G&aacute;bor Farkas' new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical GIS</em></span> is a guide to applying these tools to managing geographic
information like a pro at minimal cost. Farkas deploys the popular
QGIS application and explains how to use it to generate useful spatial
data. From there, readers are guided through the basics of queries, data
management and geoprocessing. After mastering the essentials, readers
practice their knowledge on real-world examples, solving various types of
geospatial analyses with appropriate methods. Finally, readers learn how
to publish data (and results) on the web with QGIS Server and GeoServer
and create a basic web map with the API of the lightweight Leaflet
web-mapping library. Storing data in a PostGIS database also is treated in
the book.

Crank Software's Storyboard Suite</h2></div></div><p>
Crank Software is working hard to change how embedded user interface (UI)
solutions are developed. Traditional development methodologies, asserts
the Crank group, leave designers on the sideline after the artwork has
been handed off to the software developers. This linear process typically
leads to a UI that isn't a true reflection of the design vision and
is difficult to update. Enter Storyboard Suite 5.0, Crank Software's
recently updated turnkey UI development software that gives designers
and developers the tools to work collaboratively and iterate the UI and
UX to perfection in a fraction of the time. Storyboard Suite supports
graphic designers and engineers equally with innovative features and
an intuitive workflow that allows them to work in parallel to deliver
UIs that are modern, scalable and optimized for embedded products. The
platform is powerful enough to create high-end, sophisticated UIs yet
easy to learn and use without requiring hardware decisions to be made
up front. Teams can be productive from the beginning of a project
through to final delivery, saving valuable resources and costs and
delivering powerful user experiences in less time. New features in
version 5.0 include finer execution control and custom easing rates for
improved animations and movement; ready-to-use, sharable components for
quick prototyping and test UI interactions; a new render extension to
facilitate drawing and graphing programmatically; and an exports option
that simplifies sharing of Storyboard applications for quick testing to
improve the feedback loop for design iteration. Storyboard Suite offers
Ubuntu Linux, Mac OS and Windows versions.

CloudBees, Inc.'s CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
Modern IT departments are adopting continuous delivery (CD) and automating
software pipelines to accelerate and scale their software development
and delivery across environments. This means that CD platforms are now
business-critical and need to be scalable, secure, stable and reliable. To
address these requirements, CloudBees, Inc., developed CloudBees Jenkins
Enterprise, a new unified CD platform offering that allows enterprises to
achieve CD for their entire software portfolio, securely and in a manner
that handles a large volume of projects. CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise
is based on Docker container technology and architected from the ground
up to allow for scale and failure backup. It can run anywhere, including
public cloud or private cloud, virtual environments (VMware vSphere),
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and from legacy to container-based technology.
CloudBees warns that most continuous delivery solutions focus on a
specific technology stack or process, leading to the deployment of
multiple competing or overlapping solutions lacking holistic support
of the enterprise-wide IT delivery processes. In contrast, CloudBees
Jenkins Enterprise leverages Jenkins' 1,200+ extensions and is the
only solution on the market that makes it possible for enterprises to
have a unified view across their entire software portfolio. As a result,
it is possible to evaluate how teams are progressing in their adoption
of DevOps, continuous delivery and ultimately time-to-market goals.
