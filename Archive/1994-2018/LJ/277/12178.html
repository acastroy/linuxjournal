Wonder who (or what) is hogging your bandwidth? Install a network monitor.

In a previous article, I explained the process for setting up Cacti, which is a
great program for graphing just about anything (see the November 2016
issue). One of the main things I
graph is my internet usage. And, it's great information to have, until there
is internet activity you can't explain. In my case, there was a
&ldquo;blip&rdquo;
every 20 minutes or so that would use about 4mbps of bandwidth
(Figure 1). In the grand scheme of things, it wasn't a big deal, because
my connection is 60mbps down. Still, it was driving me crazy. I don't
like the idea of something on my network doing things on the internet
without my knowledge. So, the hunt began.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12178f1.large.jpg"><img src="12178f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. That blip drove me crazy for weeks.
</p></div></div><p>
Most folks immediately told me to use Wireshark to analyze the
data. That's good advice, but the problem makes me want a real-time
monitoring system rather than a one-off packet search. Plus, even
with Wireshark, you need to address the issue of capturing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the data
flowing to and from the internet. Modern switching hardware purposefully
directs traffic only to the ports on your switch where the traffic is
intended. That means you can't just &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; the whole network without
some effort. So regardless of how I was going to analyze the traffic,
I had to be able to see the traffic. Thankfully, there are a few ways
to accomplish that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8e828"></a>
Sniffing All the Data</h2></div></div><p>
Network hubs were very common 20 years ago. The idea with a hub is
that the network data coming in is repeated to every port on the hub,
and whichever computer the packet was intended for accepts it. Every
other computer just ignored the data. This worked fine when the amount of
data was low
and the speed of the data was slow, but as more devices were added to the
network,
it quickly became congested. About that time, &ldquo;switching&rdquo; technology entered
the picture. A switch would accept data on every port, but repeat the
packets only to the single port on which the intended device was listening. At
first, switches were extremely expensive, so it wasn't uncommon to
see a four-port rackmount switch that had hubs connected to each port. It
was a way to segregate the congestion into manageable chunks. Eventually,
switching technology became mainstream. Now even the $10 eight-port devices
you can buy online are switches instead of hubs, and the idea of a hub
is outdated.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8e988"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Wi-Fi Hubs?</b></p><p>
Although Ethernet networks rarely use hub technology anymore, Wi-Fi doesn't
have that same luxury. In fact, the reason Wi-Fi access points can 
support only a certain number of devices before they become unusable is
that Wi-Fi functions conceptually like a hub. All the devices on a Wi-Fi
network receive all the packets and &ldquo;accept&rdquo; only packets destined
for them. That's the reason it is so important to be security-conscious
when using a public Wi-Fi network. Anyone else connected can see all
your traffic, so make sure any sensitive data is encrypted via SSL,
or even better, encrypt all your traffic via VPN.
</p></div><p>
Why is all that important? Well, if you're trying to monitor an entire
network, switches work against you. Back in the day of hubs, every
computer saw all the traffic on a network, which made it easy to monitor
what was happening. (It also made it easy to sniff other people's packets,
but that's another story altogether.) Thankfully, there are a few options
for capturing all the data so you can analyze traffic on your network.
</p><p>
The first thing to determine is where you want to monitor. You can 
monitor only traffic flowing through a certain place, so you need to determine
where that place is. In my case, I want to monitor internet traffic, so
from a port standpoint, I want to see all the traffic flowing into and
out of where my router plugs in to my LAN (Figure 2). There are a
few ways to capture that data&mdash;let me run through the options.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12178f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This is the bottleneck through which all internet traffic flows.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8eeb0"></a>
Option 1: Use a Hub</h2></div></div><p>
If you look at Figure 3, you can see how this option works. All the
internet traffic flows through the hub into the router. Because hubs repeat all
data to every port on the hub, you simply plug the monitoring computer
in to that same hub, and it &ldquo;hears&rdquo; all the network traffic to and from the
internet. There are a few problems with this method. One, it's difficult
to find hubs anymore, especially those capable of 100mbps. Even if
you can find a hub, it will be a cheap desktop type that is likely not
reliable enough to handle all your data. Quite honestly, even though
option 1 is technically still feasible, it's a really bad idea, and I
don't recommend it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12178f3.large.jpg"><img src="12178f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A hub is technically an option, but not a good one.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8f1c8"></a>
Option 2: Mirror a Port on Your Switch</h2></div></div><p>
This is probably the best way to monitor network traffic in a modern
LAN environment. Figure 4 shows what it looks like. The only problem
with this method is that it requires a &ldquo;smart&rdquo; or
&ldquo;managed&rdquo; switch. That
usually increases the cost drastically, but it gives you other management
features like VLANs. Still, if you already have an unmanaged switch,
this can be a large expenditure. If you want to use this method in an
environment already populated with unmanaged switches, perhaps consider
getting a small managed switch and put it in place of the hub shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12178f4.large.jpg"><img src="12178f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. This is probably the best way to monitor traffic, but it
requires a managed switch, which I didn't have.
</p></div></div><p>
The actual process for mirroring a port works differently on different
brands of switches. Regardless of the specific method, however, all
managed switches should allow you to mirror the traffic from one port to
another. Then your monitoring computer can listen on that mirror port and
analyze the traffic. It's sort of like creating an internal two-port hub
that sends traffic only one way. Usually if you do this, it's wise to
&ldquo;sniff&rdquo; with a second Ethernet card on the monitoring computer. That
way, you're not confusing traffic to and from the monitoring computer
with the internet traffic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8f5e8"></a>
Option 3: Inline Linux Bridge</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 5 shows what I actually did on my network. I didn't use this method
because it's better than option 2; rather, I used it because I didn't have
a managed switch. Basically, in this setup, you need a monitoring server
with two Ethernet cards. You create a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; interface, and plug the
computer in between the switch and the router. This does capture all the
traffic because it literally flows through the computer. Unfortunately,
it means if something goes wrong with your monitoring computer, it
can take down internet access for your entire network, along with DHCP
and DNS if your router hosts those for you. There are special Ethernet
cards with multiple ports that &ldquo;fail open&rdquo;, so that if the machine does,
traffic still flows. If you're going to spend money on this, however,
I recommend just getting a managed switch and doing a mirrored port.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12178f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Although possibly not the best way to do it, this is probably
the nerdiest. It's also the way I did it, because it didn't require any
new hardware.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8f9b0"></a>
Option 4: Use Your Router</h2></div></div><p>
This option works only if your router is robust enough to run
bandwidth-monitoring tools. Some are, especially if you're using a full-blown
server as a router. Most can do it, but not well. Still, if you only
want simple monitoring and your router can handle the load, it's an easy
way to do it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0xf8fab8"></a>
My Bridge Install</h2></div></div><p>
I went with Option 3, which meant I needed to install a network bridge
on my Linux machine. On Ubuntu, the process is really simple. It's not
difficult on other distros like CentOS, but if you're using something
other than Ubuntu, you'll need to google the specific steps. For Ubuntu,
do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install bridge-utils
</pre>
</p><p>
Then edit your /etc/network/interfaces file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The bridge interface
auto br0
iface br0 inet dhcp
    bridge_ports eth0 eth1
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0
    bridge_maxwait 0
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll need to adjust your interface names if your Ethernet devices
don't come up as eth0 and eth1, but the configuration should make sense
from looking at my example. You either can restart networking or, even better,
reboot your system to make sure it comes up properly on startup. Once
up and running, the <tt  >ifconfig</tt> command should look something like mine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
spowers@pooky:~$ ifconfig

</pre>
</p><p>
Note the only interface with an IP address is br0. The other two
interfaces are bridged together, so traffic can freely flow through
them. It's interesting that this is the way distributions like Untangled
work. They create a bridge device and then filter/block/redirect traffic
as it passes through.

The Software</h2></div></div><p>
So far, I've gotten only to the point where the monitoring computer
can listen to the traffic going to and from the internet. I haven't
actually installed any software to do the listening. Quite a few
different packages exist for capturing traffic and analyzing it. Depending on
the type of network trends you're looking for, you might choose a different
software package from me. I actually installed a few, but rely most
on BandwidthD for analyzing traffic. I'll talk more about BandwidthD,
but be sure to check out some others too:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Ntop: <a href="http://www.ntop.org" target="_self">www.ntop.org</a>
</p></li><li><p>
Wireshark: <a href="https://www.wireshark.org" target="_self">https://www.wireshark.org</a>
</p></li><li><p>
BandwidthD: <a href="http://bandwidthd.sourceforge.net" target="_self">bandwidthd.sourceforge.net</a>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I like BandwidthD because it shows traffic graphs for each device on my
network. If you remember my initial problem, I was trying to figure out
what device on my network was downloading something every 20 minutes. I
figured it was a game system or cell phone stuck in a failed download
loop or something.
</p><p>
Installing BandwidthD (or most any of the utilities) is a simple
<tt  >apt-get
install</tt> away. The software is most likely in your distribution's
software repository, and even if the version is a little outdated,
it should work perfectly fine. The only thing I needed to do is edit
/etc/bandwidthd/bandwidthd.conf and set the network I wanted to monitor
and the interface I wanted to listen on. Otherwise, I left everything
the default. BandwidthD installs an Apache configuration file, so you should
be able to access its interface at http://server.ip.address/bandwidthd/.
</p><p>
After it's running for a while, you should see statistics like those
in Figure 6,
which shows the top 20 bandwidth users on my network. It's fun information
to see, but if you're looking for a specific traffic pattern, you'll
need to scroll down a bit to see network graphs for every device on your
network. Figure 7 shows the traffic to and from my Plex Media Server. Keep
in mind this is only traffic going to and from the internet, but still,
you can see when friends and family were watching videos from my server
over the internet. It's important to note that although the default page
of BandwidthD shows only the top 20 users, you can click on the network
address to see every user who accesses the internet. It's an amazing
tool for figuring out what's happening on your network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12178f6.large.jpg"><img src="12178f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. I love BandwidthD; it's full of so much juicy data.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12178f7.large.jpg"><img src="12178f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Having a set of graphs for each device on the network is
amazingly convenient. Having it done automatically is just plain amazing.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe96580.0x1388c28"></a>
What about My Blip?</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out that I couldn't find anything on my network causing those
network usage spikes every 20 minutes. I looked at the graphs for every
single device on my network and compared it to the spikes on my Cacti
bandwidth graphs. I just couldn't find a match. Then I realized that
my total bandwidth graph from BandwidthD should come pretty close to
matching my WAN bandwidth graph from Cacti. And, it didn't. My entire
network monitoring server setup seemed to be for nothing, because I
couldn't track down what was causing the blips.
</p><p>
I decided to troubleshoot my Cacti installation to see if there was
something happening every 20 minutes to cause an error. It was then that I
noticed that while the WAN interface on my router had the blip every
20 minutes, the LAN side of my router (which I graph, but never really
look at because it's just an inverse of the WAN graph) didn't have the
blip. It turns out that my UniFi router has a feature that runs a speed test
every 20 minutes to graph the health of the connection. I don't remember
turning that feature on, but sure enough, it was enabled. When I disabled
the periodic speedtest, my network blips stopped.
</p><p>
So in the end, my network monitoring setup didn't find anything, but I
don't regret setting it up. Now I can monitor traffic easily and see
what sort of bandwidth requirements individual devices need. In fact,
the only change I plan to make is to set up my server using Option
2 instead of Option 3, because I recently upgraded my server rack to
managed switching hardware. That way if my monitoring computer dies,
my internet connection stays up.
