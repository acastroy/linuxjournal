There's more to sysadmin experience than a name. Find out the skills
behind these sysadmin titles.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2955580.0x2a4d408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is the fourth in a series of articles on systems administrator
fundamentals. These days, DevOps has made even the job title &ldquo;systems
administrator&rdquo; seems a bit archaic like the &ldquo;systems
analyst&rdquo; title it
replaced. These DevOps positions are rather different from sysadmin
jobs in the past with a much larger emphasis on software development
far beyond basic shell scripting and as a result often are filled
with people with software development backgrounds without much prior
sysadmin experience. 
</p><p>
In the past, a sysadmin would enter the role at a
junior level and be mentored by a senior sysadmin on the team, but in
many cases these days, companies go quite a while with cloud outsourcing
before their first DevOps hire. As a result, the DevOps engineer might
be thrust into the role at a junior level with no mentor around apart
from search engines and Stack Overflow posts. 
</p><p>
In the first article in this series, I explained how to approach
alerting and on-call rotations as a sysadmin. In the second article, I
discussed how to automate yourself out of a job. In the third, I covered
why and how you should use tickets. In this article, I describe
the overall sysadmin career path and what I consider the attributes that
might make you a &ldquo;senior sysadmin&rdquo; instead of a
&ldquo;sysadmin&rdquo; or &ldquo;junior sysadmin&rdquo;,
along with some tips on how to level up.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that titles are pretty fluid and loose things, and
that they mean different things to different people. Also, it will take different
people different amounts of time to &ldquo;level up&rdquo; depending on their innate
sysadmin skills, their work ethic and the opportunities they get to
gain more experience. That said, be suspicious of anyone who leveled up
to a senior level in any field in only a year or two&mdash;it takes time in
a career to make the kinds of mistakes and learn the kinds of lessons
you need to learn before you can move up to the next level.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2955580.0x2a4d8d8"></a>
Junior Systems Administrator</h2></div></div><p>
Junior sysadmins are early on in their sysadmin training. It
might be their first sysadmin job where they are learning everything
from scratch, or they might have a few years of experience under their
belts. Either way, a few attributes are common among
junior sysadmins:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Tasks will require help from other members of the team to complete.
</p></li><li><p>
They will rely heavily on documentation and may not understand what individual
tasks do.
</p></li><li><p>
It may take weeks or even months to be productive at a new job.
</p></li><li><p>
Most of their time will be spent with daily tickets.
</p></li><li><p>
Eventually they might take on a project, but will need quite a bit of help to
complete it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One of the first attributes that defines junior sysadmins is the amount
of outside help they will need to do their jobs. Generally speaking, they
will need help and direction to perform day-to-day tasks, especially at
first. If you document your routine tasks (and you should!), you will
find that junior sysadmins will dutifully follow your procedures step by step,
but they may not understand exactly what those steps do. If a task deviates
from the norm, or if for some reason a step fails, they will escalate
up to a more senior member of the team for help&mdash;this is a good thing,
because this mentoring is one of the main ways that junior sysadmins build
their experience besides making mistakes and fixing them.
</p><p>
It might take sysadmins at this level a few weeks or even months at a new
organization until they are productive and can start doing daily 
tasks independently without help. These are great opportunities for a
team to audit documentation and for junior members of the team
to flag gaps in documentation or places where they are out of date. If
you have junior team members add documentation themselves, just
make sure that a more senior team member goes over it to make
sure it's correct and complete.
</p><p>
A sysadmin's task list is usually divided into two main categories:
day-to-day tasks and projects. Junior sysadmins often end up being
assigned more of the day-to-day &ldquo;grunt work&rdquo;, not as a punishment, but
just because projects usually require more experience&mdash;experience they
will get as they master daily tickets. 
</p><p>
That said, at some point, it will
be important for junior sysadmins to take on their first project. Ideally,
this will be a project without a strict deadline, so they can take the
time they need to research and get it right. At this level, a more senior
team member will need to devote a fair amount of time to act as
a mentor and help direct the planning and research for the project and
answer any questions.
</p><p>
Both daily tasks and projects are important for junior sysadmins, as it's
the mastery of daily tasks and the successful completion of a couple 
projects that will help prepare junior sysadmins to level up. Each task
they master will add a certain level of confidence and proficiency in
routine sysadmin tasks, and projects will help develop their research
skills and the ability to complete tasks that fall outside a playbook.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2955580.0x2a4e010"></a>
Mid-Level Systems Administrator</h2></div></div><p>
It can be difficult to draw the exact line where a sysadmin levels up past
the junior level. There isn't an exact number of years' experience needed;
instead, it has more to do with sysadmins' competency with their craft
and their overall confidence and independence. Here are a few attributes
that are common to mid-level sysadmins:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
They generally perform day-to-day tasks independently.
</p></li><li><p>
They understand some of the technology behind their routine tasks and don't
just parrot commands they see in documentation.
</p></li><li><p>
It takes a few weeks up to a month to be productive at a new job.
</p></li><li><p>
Their time is pretty equally balanced between daily tickets and longer-term
projects.
</p></li><li><p>
They are able to come up with new approaches and improvements to existing
tasks.
</p></li><li><p>
They can complete simple projects independently and more complex projects with
some help from more senior team members.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The main difference between junior sysadmins and mid-level sysadmins has
to do with their independence. As sysadmins become more comfortable with
servers in general, and the processes within an organization specifically,
they start to be able to perform typical tasks by themselves. 
Mid-level sysadmins should be able to handle all of the normal tasks that
are thrown at them without outside help. It's only when they get an odd
&ldquo;curve ball&rdquo;, such as a one-off task that hasn't been done
before or some
unique emergency, that mid-level sysadmins may need to reach out to
the more senior members of the team for some guidance. As with junior
sysadmins, this type of help is very important, and it would be a mistake
for mid-level sysadmins not to ask for help with odd requests just to
try to be &ldquo;more senior&rdquo;. Asking questions and getting advice 
from more experienced sysadmins will help them level up. If they
try to go it completely alone, no matter what, it will take much longer.
</p><p>
Mid-level sysadmins also take on more projects than their junior
counterparts, and they are able to complete simple projects independently.
Junior sysadmins might be able to maintain an existing system, but
mid-level sysadmins actually might be able to set it up from scratch. They
also can start tackling larger, more complicated projects that may
require them to learn new technologies and come up with some approaches
independently, although in those cases, they'll still sometimes need to reach
out to more experienced team members to make sure they are on
the right track.
</p><p>
As sysadmins master all of the day-to-day tasks, they also
naturally will start to come up with improvements and efficiencies for those
tasks, and they may make some suggestions to the team along those lines. These
improvements may become projects for them in their own right. They also should
be able to provide some level of mentorship and training for junior
members on the team, at least with daily tasks.
</p><p>
One of the most important things for mid-level sysadmins to do if they
want to level up is to take on projects and help triage
emergencies. 
Projects and emergencies often provide opportunities to think outside 
established playbooks. It's this kind of critical thinking, research
and problem-solving that builds the experience that's so important for
sysadmins. They will start to notice some common patterns
the more emergencies and projects they work through, and that realization
builds a certain level of confidence and deeper understanding that is
vital for moving to the next level.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2955580.0x2a4e7f8"></a>
Senior Systems Administrator</h2></div></div><p>
Although some may consider people to be senior sysadmins based on a
certain number of years' experience, to me, what makes someone a senior
sysadmin versus a mid-level sysadmin isn't years of experience or number
of places worked at, it's more a particular state of mind that
one can get to via many different means. Many people get the title before
they get the state of mind, and often it takes getting the title (or some
of the responsibilities associated with it) to make a person level up.
</p><p>
The main difference between senior sysadmins and mid-level sysadmins
is that one day, something clicks in senior sysadmins' minds when
they realize that basically every emergency they've responded to 
and every project they've worked on to that point all have a common
trait: given enough time and effort, they can track down the cause of
just about any problem and complete just about any sysadmin task. This
is a matter of true confidence, not false bravado, and it's this kind
of real independence that marks senior sysadmins. 
</p><p>
Early on in your
career, certain tasks or projects just seem over your head, and you
absolutely need help to complete them. Later on, you master daily
tasks, but weird emergencies or complex projects still may intimidate
you. Senior sysadmins have completed so many projects and responded
to so many emergencies, that they eventually build the confidence such
that they aren't intimidated by the next project, the next emergency
or the prospect of being responsible for important mission-critical
infrastructure. Like mid-level sysadmins might approach their daily
tickets, senior sysadmins approach any task that comes their way.
</p><p>
Here are some attributes common to senior sysadmins:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
They can perform both daily tasks and complex projects independently.
</p></li><li><p>
They understand the fundamentals behind the technologies they use and can
distill complex tasks down into simple playbooks everyone on the team can
follow.
</p></li><li><p>
They can be productive at a new job within a week or two.
</p></li><li><p>
Their time is spent more on large projects and odd requests that fall outside
the norm.
</p></li><li><p>
They mentor other team members and have a good sense of best
practices.
</p></li><li><p>
They come up with new projects and improvements and can suggest appropriate
designs to solve new problems.
</p></li><li><p>
They understand their own fallibility and develop procedures to protect
themselves from their own mistakes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Again, it's the confidence and independence of senior sysadmins that
separates them from mid-level sysadmins. That's not to say that senior
sysadmins never ask for help. Along with the confidence of being able to
tackle any sysadmin task is the humility that comes with a career full
of mistakes. In fact, part of their experience will have taught them
the wisdom of asking other people on the team for feedback to make sure
they haven't missed anything. Often senior sysadmins will come up with
multiple ways to tackle a problem, each with pros and cons, and use the
rest of the team as a sounding board to help choose which approach would
work best in a specific case.
</p><p>
Senior sysadmins' experiences exposes them to many different
technologies, systems and architectures through the years. This means they
start to notice which approaches work, which don't, and which work at
first but cause problems in the long run. In particular, they might track
some project they completed themselves through its lifetime and note how
their initial solutions worked to a particular point and then either
failed as it scaled, or needed to change with the advent of some new
technology. The more this happens, the more senior sysadmins start to
develop a natural sense of best practices and what I call the &ldquo;sysadmin
sense&rdquo;, which, like Spiderman's &ldquo;spidey sense&rdquo;, starts to warn them when
they see something that is going to result in a problem down the road,
like a backup system that's never been tested or a system that has a
single point of failure. It's in developing this expertise that they
are able to level up to the last major level outside management.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2955580.0x2e47338"></a>
Systems Architect</h2></div></div><p>
Although every organization is a bit different, there are two main career
paths senior sysadmins might choose from as they gain experience. The most
common path is in management. Senior sysadmins over time end up spending
more time mentoring their team and often are promoted to team leads and
from there into full managers over their teams. The other path continues
on with the &ldquo;individual-contributor&rdquo; role where they may or may not act as
team leads, but they don't have any direct reports and don't spend
time doing employee evaluations or things of that sort. Of course, there
also are paths that blend those two extremes. In this last section, I
describe one of the last levels for an individual-contributor
sysadmin to move to: systems architect.
</p><p>
In many organizations, the line between a systems architect and a senior
sysadmin can be blurry. Equally blurry are the qualifications that
may make someone a systems architect. That said, generally speaking,
systems architects have spent a number of years as senior
sysadmins. During the course of their careers, they have participated in a
large number of projects, both with a team and independently, and they have
started to see what works and what doesn't. It's this accumulation of
experience with a wide variety of technologies and project designs that
starts to build this inherent sense of best practices that makes someone
a systems architect.
</p><p>
The following are some attributes common to systems architects:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
They are familiar with many different technologies that solve a particular
problem along with their pros and cons.
</p></li><li><p>
When solving a problem, they come up with multiple approaches and can explain
and defend their preferred approach.
</p></li><li><p>
They understand the limitations to a solution and where it will fail as it
scales.
</p></li><li><p>
They can distill a general problem down to individual tasks as part of a
larger project that can be divided among a team.
</p></li><li><p>
They can evaluate new technologies based on their relative merits and not be
distracted by hype or popularity.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Systems architects aren't necessarily married to a particular approach,
although they may have a set of approaches for tackling certain problems
based on what's worked for them in the past. Because they have operated at
a senior level for some time, they have developed a deeper understanding
of what defines a good architecture versus a bad one and how to choose
one technology over the other. Technology moves in trends, and those
trends tend to repeat themselves over a long enough timeline. Systems
architects have been around long enough that they have seen at least one
of those trend cycles for some hyped technology, and they probably have been
burned at some point in the past by adopting an immature technology too
quickly just because it was popular. Whereas junior administrators
are more likely to get caught up in the hype behind a particular new
technology and want to use it everywhere, systems architects are more
likely to cut through the hype and, for any new technology, be able to
identify where it would be useful and where it wouldn't.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope this description of levels in systems administration has been
helpful as you plan your own career. When it comes to gaining experience,
nothing quite beats making your own mistakes and having to recover from
them yourself. At the same time, it sure is a lot easier to invite
battle-hardened senior sysadmins to beers and learn from their war
stories. I hope this series in Sysadmin 101 fundamentals has been helpful
for those of you new to the sysadmin trenches, and also I hope it helps save you from
having to learn from your own mistakes as you move forward in your career.
