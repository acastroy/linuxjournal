When a university professor writes a journal article for no pay,
and the university library can't afford the journal, something is wrong.
Open access is bringing reform to scientific publishing.

The Scientific community, especially in the area of
bioinformatics, always has been a strong proponent
of open-source technologies. Linux and related
technologies, such as the Perl programming language,
rapidly are becoming the de facto standards for
conducting computational research in the biological
sciences. In fact, openness and information
sharing are some of the most fundamental tenets of
the scientific world. Scientific progress is
based on the ideal that information uncovered by
one group should benefit the research and development
efforts of other groups as well.
</p><p>
Information sharing is promulgated through the
publication of scientific research in peer-reviewed
journals. However, there is one kink in this system.
Most scholarly journals do not pay authors,
and many actually impose page charges on scientists
who contribute. Journal editorial boards also are typically
made up of scientists who serve without pay. Yet, despite
the fact that
scholarly journals have little
or no costs for articles and editorial direction,
many of them require the payment of prohibitively
expensive subscription fees before researchers from an
institution are able to access the research contained
inside these journals.
</p><p>
The growth of the open-source revolution within the
bioinformatics world is causing a reevaluation of
this publishing model, however. Perhaps, in
essence, these two campaigns are really striving for
the same goal. The open-source software revolution
seeks to promote freedom among software users, so
they have the freedom to use the software in
any way they see fit. Among these freedoms is the
ability to examine the source code and study the
inner workings of the software in order to learn how
it operates. Users then are free to modify this
source code and adapt it as they see fit. Users
then can make these improvements available to the rest
of the world.
</p><p>
Within the Open Source community, this is how
software evolves. Someone has an idea and releases
a program that makes this idea possible. Others
then are able to take this functionality and apply it
to new problem sets, perhaps even ones the original
author never thought possible. As scientists,
we currently are seeking the same kind of freedom
for our research results.
</p><p>
The scientific world actually has made some strides
in this direction, with several upstart publications,
such as the Public Library of Science (PLOS), making
all of the articles they publish open access.
However, many established publications still
insist that they must continue to charge high fees
for subscriptions and for on-line access to archives
in order to turn a profit.
</p><p>
The momentum of the open access movement is picking
up, however, and has led to the development of a
promising proposal by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), an organization that funds much of
the biomedical research within the United States.
According to this new proposal, publishers can
keep exclusive subscription-based access to
publications that result from NIH-funded research
for a period of only six months. After that time, the
papers must be made available to the public in
an electronic format that has been archived in a
scientific literature repository such as Pubmed.
If this proposal passes, it will be a major stride
toward achieving open access for research articles
in the biological sciences. It is expected
that many publishers will adapt their ways rather
than risk losing large numbers of articles that
help their journals sell in the first place.
</p><p>
As Linux and open-source enthusiasts, this issue holds
more for us, however, than simply the freedom
to access scientific discoveries. It represents
a change toward openness in an environment that
in many ways was trying to become more closed.
We all have witnessed the development of copy
restriction methods on audio files, videos, e-books
and proprietary software. Industry groups such as
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)
also seek to add additional restrictions to the way
we can utilize our electronic media and software.
</p><p>
This current publication movement is a step in the other
direction&mdash;a
step toward promoting the same types of freedom
and openness that we seek when we turn to an open-source solution. The open access issue is not only
significant for the scientific advances it may
help unleash, but also because it provides the Open
Source community with an alternative means to enlighten
society about the virtues of freedom and openness. This,
in turn, may garner more support for the
open-source cause. Thus, in the spirit of freedom
and openness, we should rally behind this issue and
demand the right to access openly the research that
our tax and tuition dollars are supporting.
