So that is where my 2005 wine encyclopedia has gone! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon
Dieu</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, I've been looking for that everywhere. Wait a minute. That's my
Parisienne cookbook, my Tuscan creations cookbook and my Provencal herbs
reference. How many of my books do you have here? Non, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, I am not suggesting anything other than I have been looking for these
for some time now. Yes, you are right, at least they weren't lost. I
think you had better prepare the tables, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, our
guests will be here any moment.
</p><p>
Too late, they already are here. Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span> to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where fine Linux fare is always on the
menu, and the wine cellar is always among the greatest in the world. Please sit and make yourselves
comfortable while Fran&ccedil;ois fetches the wine. Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, head down to the north wing of the cellar and bring back the 2000 Bordeaux
we were, ahem, subjecting to quality control earlier. It's next
to the Margaux labeled &ldquo;don't open until 2010&rdquo;.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>!
</p><p>
While we wait for my faithful waiter to return with the wine, let me tell
you about today's menu. As you know, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span> has served up a great
number of recipes in the years we have been here. We've also served
up a great deal of wine. Much as I would like to think that I can remember
all of this information, the truth is somewhat more realistic. That's why
there are shelves of books on Linux, cooking and wine in the kitchen,
cellar and office. The problem becomes one of management, and that's
why we need a database.
</p><p>
But what kind of database? How about something easy and extremely
flexible. Meet Tellico.
Robby Stephenson's Tellico is billed as a collection manager, but I like
to think of it as a versatile personal library system. It's
a great tool for keeping track of your many cookbooks as well as Linux
books, science-fiction books, mysteries and so on (Figure 1). That
in itself would make it an extremely useful tool for keeping track of
what books various friends and family have borrowed. I don't know about you,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but I have lent out numerous books over the years that
have never come back. The people who borrowed them forgot whom they
borrowed books from, and I forgot whom I lent them to&mdash;with the exception of
Fran&ccedil;ois. I keep a special list for him.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8028f1.large.jpg"><img src="8028f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Tellico makes a great personal library system, and it looks
good doing it.
</p></div></div><p>
Tellico has templates to track other
forms of collections as well, including videos, music, coins,
stamps and more. There's even a template for your wine cellar. You
also can create your own collections or modify existing forms. I
show you more and tell you how to work with it shortly.
Prebuilt packages are
available for a number of the major distributions, such as Fedora, SuSE,
Mandrake, Slackware and others. You also can download the source (see the
on-line Resources) and
build it using our famous extract and build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf tellico-0.13.1.tar.gz
cd tellico-0.13.1
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
Tellico is a KDE 3.1 or greater package and requires the associated Qt
and KDE development libraries. If you are working from source, you may
want to consider building with a couple of additional but optional libraries.
The taglib development libraries are the first option, which lets you read
information from audio files&mdash;more on this shortly.
Another optional library is yaz. Build Tellico with that and you have
access to Z39.50 searches.
</p><p>
When you start Tellico&mdash;by running the command
<tt  >tellico</tt>&mdash;you start with the proverbial clean slate. Expand the program window to
a comfortable size and start defining a collection. To create a book
collection, click File on the Tellico menu bar, then New and then select New
Book Collection. I mentioned that Tellico is a great personal library
system to let you record your books and keep track of when and where you
got them, as well as who has borrowed them. Before we get to that stage,
however, we need to enter the information from our collection (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8028f2.large.jpg"><img src="8028f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Entering a New Title into Your Book Collection
</p></div></div><p>
Under the various tabs, you can enter the obvious title and author
information as well as publisher, publishing date, edition, genre,
series number, condition, whether the book is signed, whether it is
currently loaned out and whether you have read it. Many more fields are
available for you to explore yourself, but I must
mention that you can enter a cover image too, as you saw in Figure 1.
</p><p>
If this seems like a lot of work and you don't feel like adding all this
information yourself, there is another way. No, you don't have to hire
anyone. All you need is a connection to the Internet, because Tellico offers
the ultimate in convenience. Simply click Edit on the menu bar and select Internet Search.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8028f3.large.jpg"><img src="8028f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. With an Internet connection, entering book information is a breeze.
</p></div></div><p>
When the Internet Search dialog appears (Figure 3), you can enter the
book's title, author, International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or any keyword you wish. Searches are
done on Amazon.com's database, although you can search on UK,
Japan and Germany sites too. If you searched by ISBN, you likely will have
only one entry returned, but other searches probably will return more than
one title. Click to select the one you want, then click Add Entry.
Your database automatically is updated along with a nice cover image.
</p><p>
Tellico provides an intelligent search dialog to find a particular title
or range of titles. You also can access this information at a glance by
adding or removing columns reflecting the various fields from the listings
on the right-hand side. For instance, if you always want to know what
is out, simply right-click on the fields bar and add Loaned. Titles with
that field checked have a green check mark in that position.
</p><p>
Other options exist for bringing data into your Tellico collections
besides the ones described here. Click on File and look under the Import
submenu. There, you can find options to use data from simple CSV files,
Alexandria, Bibtex and more.
</p><p>
The export function is even more interesting because this is where we
enter into reporting. You can print an entry at any time, but
the export function is somewhat more powerful than this.
For example,
by selecting HTML export, you can generate an HTML page of all your
books with whatever display fields your particular view uses.
You then are asked for an HTML filename, whether you want to format all
fields or selected entries only and so on. The result is a clean HTML-formatted
page (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8028f4.large.jpg"><img src="8028f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. An HTML-Formatted Report
</p></div></div><p>
Before we move on, I want to tell you about one other export function of
which I am particularly fond. Choose Export to PilotDB from the list,
and you can generate a PDB format report readable by your favorite Palm
document reader. Simply hotsync to install your document, and you have
everything your need at your fingertips.
</p><p>
When I started telling you about Tellico, I mentioned that templates for
other collections exist, including music collections. If
you don't have a collection on the go already, click File and select
New Music Collection. Entering a new CD title is a process similar to
that of entering a book, except the fields are different. That said,
adding your CD collection to your library is easy if you have the taglib
extensions on your system. Simply enter a music CD
into your CD-ROM or DVD drive, click File, select Import and choose
Import Audio CD Data (Figure 5). The program reads the information
from your CD and imports it to your collection.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8028f5.large.jpg"><img src="8028f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Tellico can read the title, artist and track information
directly from your CDs.
</p></div></div><p>
Once your titles are entered, you can go back and fine-tune any
information that might be missing. Of course, if your collection is
on vinyl or tape, you have to enter everything manually. As with
the book collection, you can enter that an album has been loaned to
a friend. Knowing what books and music you have and where they are at
the moment, you can sit back with a glass of wine and relax.
</p><p>
And now, we find ourselves back at wine, which is not a bad place to be. What
about your wine cellar? Incredibly, Tellico has something for the home
wine cellar as well. In the same way that you created a book and music
collection, you also can create a wine collection. Click File, then New
and select New Wine Collection. Now, click Collection, then New Entry
and start adding your wines, one by one (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8028f6.large.jpg"><img src="8028f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. But of course, we can build a wine cellar database as well.
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, there is no magical entry system for building a database
of your wine collection, no fanciful way to scan the labels and
have all the information magically appear. Each bottle must be entered
manually (Figure 5). Still, spending a little time in the wine cellar,
studying and recording your collection should not be seen as chore but
a labor of love.
</p><p>
Finally, for those who have been asking themselves for a package that
would allow them to create simple, custom databases, Tellico is also for you.
Instead of using one of the predefined templates, choose to create a custom
collection. The default collection fields are
extremely simple here&mdash;title only&mdash;so you will want to modify it. After
creating your custom collection, click Collection on the menu bar and
select Collection fields. Here, you can define additional fields,
whether text, numeric or whatever your needs might be.
</p><p>
On that note, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I see by the clock that
closing time once again has arrived. Now that our wine cellar is entirely
up to date, Fran&ccedil;ois can give you his complete attention and happily
will refill your glasses. Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us
drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
