You can speed up complex Web tasks while retaining the simplicity of CGI.
With many useful libraries available, the jump from a scripting language to C isn't as big as you might think.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x13632f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Perl, Python and PHP are the holy trinity of CGI application
programming. Stores have shelves full of books about these languages,
they're covered well in the computer press and there's plenty on the
Internet about them. A distinct lack of information exists, however, on using
C to write CGI applications. In this article, I show how to
use C for CGI programming and lay out some situations in which it
provides significant advantages.
</p><p>
I use C in my applications for three reasons: speed, features and
stability. Although conventional wisdom says otherwise, my own benchmarks have
found that C and PHP are equivalent in speed when the processing to be
done is simple. When there is any complexity
to the processing, C wins hands-down.
</p><p>
In addition, C provides an excellent feature set. The language itself comes with a
bare-bones set of features, but a staggering number of
libraries are available for nearly any job for which a computer
is used. Perl, of course, is no slouch in this area, and I don't contend that
C offers more extensibility, but both can fill nearly any bill.
</p><p>
Furthermore, CGI programs written in C are stable. Because the program is
compiled, it is not as susceptible to changes in the operating
environment as PHP is. Also, because the language is stable,
it does not experience the dramatic changes to which PHP users
have been subjected over the past few years.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1363500"></a>
The Application</h2></div></div><p>
My application is a simple event listing suitable for a
business to list upcoming events, say, the meeting schedule for a day
or the events at a church. It provides an administrative interface
intended to be password-protected and a public interface that lists
all upcoming events (but only upcoming events). This application also
provides for
runtime configuration and interface independence.
</p><p>
I use a database, rather than write my own data
store, and a configuration file contains the database
connection information. A collection of files is used
to provide interface/code separation.
</p><p>
The administrative interface allows events to be listed, edited,
saved and deleted. Listing events is the default action if no
other action is provided. Both new and existing events can be saved.
The interface consists of a grid screen that displays the list of
events and a detail screen that contains the full record of a single
event.
</p><p>
The database schema for this application consists of a single table,
defined in Listing 1. This schema is MySQL-specific, but an equivalent
schema can be created for any database engine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1363710"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. MySQL Schema
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE event (
  event_no int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  event_begin date NOT NULL default '0000-00-00',
  name varchar(80) NOT NULL default '',
  location varchar(80) NOT NULL default '',
  begin_hour varchar(10) default NULL,
  end_hour varchar(10) default NULL,
  event_end date NOT NULL default '0000-00-00',
  PRIMARY KEY  (event_no),
  KEY event_date (event_begin)
)

</pre></div><p>
The following functions are the minimum necessary to implement the
functionality of the administrative interface: list_events(),
show_event(), save_event() and delete_event().
I also am going to abstract the reading and writing of database data
into their own group of functions. This keeps each function simpler,
which makes debugging easier. The functions that I need for the
data-storage interface are event_create(), event_destroy(),
event_read(), event_write and event_delete. To make my life easier,
I'm also going to add event_fetch_range(), so I can choose a range
of events&mdash;something I need to do in at least two places.
</p><p>
Next, I need to abstract my records to C structures and abstract database
result sets to linked lists. Abstraction lets me change database
engines or data representation with relatively little expense, because
only a little part of my code deals directly with the data store.
</p><p>
There isn't room here to print all of my source code.
Complete source code and my Makefile can be downloaded from my Web
site (see the on-line Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x13639d0"></a>
Tools</h2></div></div><p>
The first hurdle to overcome when using C is acquiring the set of tools you
need. At bare minimum, you need a CGI parser to break out the
CGI information for you. Chances are good that you're also
looking for some database connectivity. A little bit of
logic/interface independence is good too, so you aren't
rewriting code every time the site needs a makeover.
</p><p>
For CGI parsing, I recommend the cgic library from Thomas Boutell (see
Resources). It's shockingly easy to use and
provides access to all parts of the CGI interface. If you're a C++
person, the cgicc libraries also are suitable (see Resources),
although I found the Boutell library to be easier to use.
</p><p>
MySQL is pretty much the standard for UNIX Web development,
so I stick with it for my sample application. Every significant
database engine has a functional C interface library, though, so you
can use whatever database you like.
</p><p>
I'm going to provide my own interface-independence routines, but you
could use libxml and libxslt to do the same thing with a good deal
more sophistication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1363be0"></a>
Runtime Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
At runtime, I need to be able to configure the database connection.
Given a filename and an array of character strings for the
configuration keys, my configuration function populates a
corresponding array of configuration values, as shown in Listing 2.
Now I can populate a string array with whatever keys I've chosen to
use and get the results back in the value array.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1363ce8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

          while(isspace(*target)) *target-- = 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  fclose(cfile);

}

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1363ea0"></a>
User Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The user interface has two parts. As a programmer, I'm
concerned primarily with the input forms and URL strings. Everybody
else cares how the page around my form looks and takes the
form itself for granted. The solution to keep both parties happy is to have
the page exist separately from the form and my program.
</p><p>
Templating libraries abound in PHP and Perl, but there are no common
HTML templating libraries in C. The easiest solution is to include
only the barest minimum of the output in my C code and keep the
rest in HTML files that are output at the appropriate time. A
function that can do this is found in Listing 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1364000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. HTML Template Function
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

void html_get(char* path, char* file) {

  struct stat sb;
  FILE* html;
  char* buffer;
  char fullpath[1024];

  /* File &amp; path name exceed system limits */
  if (strlen(path) + strlen(file) &gt; 1024) return;

  sprintf(fullpath, "%s/%s", path, file);
  if (stat(fullpath, &amp;sb)) return;

  buffer = (char*)calloc(1, sb.st_size + 1);
  if (!buffer) return;
  html = fopen(fullpath, "r");
  fread((void*)buffer, 1, sb.st_size, html);
  fclose(html);
  puts(buffer);
  free(buffer);

}

</pre></div><p>
Before generating output, I need to tell the Web server and the
browser what I'm sending; cgiHeaderContentType() accomplishes this task. I want a content type of text/html, so I pass that as the
argument. The general steps to follow for any page I want to display
are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
cgiHeaderContentType("text/html");
</p></li><li><p>
html_get(path, pagetop.html);
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
html_get(path, pagebottom.html);
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1364528"></a>
Form Processing</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I can generate a page and print a form, I need to be able
to process that form. I need to read both numeric and text elements,
so I use a couple of functions from the cgic library:
cgiFormStringNoNewlines() and cgiFormInteger(). The cgic library
implements the main function and requires that I implement
int cgiMain(void). cgiMain() is where I put the bulk of my form
processing.
</p><p>
To display a single record in my show_event function, I get the
event_no (my primary key) from the CGI eventno parameter.
cgiFormInteger() retrieves an integer value and sets a default
value if no CGI parameter is provided.
</p><p>
I also need to get a whole raft of data from the form in
save_event. Dates are thorny things to input because they consist of
three pieces of data: year, month and date. I need both a begin and
an end date, which gives me six fields to interpret. I also need to
input the name of the event, begin and end times (which are strings
because they might be events themselves, such as sunrise or sunset)
and the location. Listing 4 shows how this works in code.
</p><p>
Listing 4 also demonstrates cgiHeaderLocation(), a function
that redirects the user to a new page. After I've saved the submitted data,
I want to show the event listing page. Instead of a literal string, I
use one of the variables that libcgic provides,
cgiScriptName. Using this variable instead of a literal one means the
program name can be changed without breaking the program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1364738"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. save_event(), Parsing CGI Data
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

struct event* e;

e = event_create();
cgiFormInteger("eventno", &amp;e-&gt;event_no, 0);
cgiFormStringNoNewlines("name", e-&gt;name, 80);
cgiFormStringNoNewlines("location",
                        e-&gt;location, 80);

/* Processing date fields */
cgiFormInteger("beginyear",
               &amp;e-&gt;event_begin-&gt;year, 0);
cgiFormInteger("beginmonth",
               &amp;e-&gt;event_begin-&gt;month, 0);
cgiFormInteger("beginday", &amp;e-&gt;event_begin-&gt;day, 0);
cgiFormInteger("endyear", &amp;e-&gt;event_end-&gt;year, 0);
cgiFormInteger("endmonth", &amp;e-&gt;event_end-&gt;month, 0);
cgiFormInteger("endday", &amp;e-&gt;event_end-&gt;day, 0);

/* Process begin &amp; end times separately */
cgiFormStringNoNewlines("beginhour",
                        e-&gt;event_begin-&gt;hour, 10);
cgiFormStringNoNewlines("endhour",
                        e-&gt;event_end-&gt;hour, 10);

event_write(e);

cgiHeaderLocation(cgiScriptName);


</pre></div><p>
Finally, I need a way to handle the submit buttons. They're the most
complex input, because I need to launch a function based on their
values and select a default value, just in case. The cgic library has
a function, cgiFormSelectSingle(), that emulates this behavior exactly.
It requires the list of possible values to be in an array of strings.
It populates an integer variable with the index of the parameter in
the array or uses a default value if there are no matches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1364948"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

                    "Save", "Delete", 0};
void (*action)(void)[5] = {list_events,
  show_event, save_event, delete_event, 0};
int result;

cgiFormSelectSingle("do", command, 4, &amp;result, 0);
action[result]();


</pre></div><p>
See Resources for information on function pointers.
If function pointers still
baffle you, you can choose the function to run in a switch
statement. I prefer the array of function pointers because it is more
compact, but my older code still makes use of the switch statement.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1364b58"></a>
Database System</h2></div></div><p>
MySQL from C is largely the same as PHP, if you're used to that
interface. You have to use MySQL's string escape functions to
escape problematic characters in your strings, such as quote characters
or the back slash character, but otherwise it is basically
the same.
The show_event() function requires me to fetch a single record from
the primary key. All of the error checking bulks up the code, but
it's really three basic statements.
A call to mysql_query() executes the MySQL statement and generates a
result set. A call to mysql_store_result() retrieves the result set
from the server. Finally, a call to mysql_fetch_row() pulls a single
MYSQL_ROW variable from the result set.
</p><p>
The MYSQL_ROW variable can be treated like an array of strings
(char**). If any of the data is numeric and you want to treat it as
numeric data, you need to convert it. For instance, in my
application it is desirable to have the date as three separate numeric
components. Because this data is structured as YYYY-MM-DD, I use
sscanf() to get the components (Listing 6).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x1364cb8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

MYSQL_RES* res;
MYSQL_ROW row;

int beginmonth;
int beginday;

if (mysql_query(db, sql)) {
  print_error(mysql_error(db));
  return;
}
if((res = mysql_store_result(db)) == 0) {
  print_error(mysql_error(db));
  return;
}
if ((row = mysql_fetch_row(res)) == 0) {
  print_error("No event found by that number");
  return;
}

sscanf(row[0], "%d-%d-%d", &amp;beginyear, &amp;beginmonth,
       &amp;beginday);


</pre></div><p>
Writing data to the database is more interesting because of the need
to escape the data. Listing 7 shows how it is done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x135b758"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

                         strlen(name));

</pre></div><p>
escapedname holds the same string as name, with MySQL special
characters escaped so I can insert them into an SQL statement
without worry. It is essential that you escape all strings read from
user input; otherwise, a devious person could take advantage of your
lapse and do unpleasant things to your database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x135b968"></a>
Debugging CGI Programs</h2></div></div><p>
One distinct disadvantage of debugging C is that errors tend to cause
a segmentation fault with no diagnostic message about the source of
the error. Debuggers are fine for most other types of programs, but
CGI programs present a special challenge because of the way they acquire
input.
</p><p>
To help with this challenge, the cgic library includes a CGI program called capture. This program
saves to a file any CGI input sent to it. You
need to set this filename in capture's source code. When your
CGI program needs debugging, add a call to cgiReadEnvironment(char*) to
the top of your cgiMain() function. Be sure to set the filename
parameter to match the filename set in capture. Then,
send the problematic data to capture, making it either the action of the
form or the script in your request. You now can use GDB or your
favorite debugger to see what sort of trouble your code
has generated.
</p><p>
You can take some steps to simplify later debugging
and development. Although these apply to all programming, they pay off
particularly well in CGI programming. Remember that a function should do one thing and
one thing only, and test early and test often.
</p><p>
It's a good idea to test each function you write as soon as possible
to make sure it performs as expected. And, it's not a bad idea to see
how it responds to erroneous data as well. It's highly likely that at
some point the function will be given bad data. Catching this behavior ahead of time can
save unpleasant calls during your off hours.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x135bb78"></a>
Deployment</h2></div></div><p>
In most situations, your development machine and your deployment
machine are not going to be the same. As much as possible, try
to make your development system match the production system.
For instance, my software tends to be developed
on Linux or OpenBSD and nearly always is deployed on FreeBSD.
</p><p>
When you're preparing to build or install on the deployment machine,
it is particularly important to be aware of differences in library
versions. You can see which dynamic libraries your code uses with
<tt  >ldd</tt>. It's a good idea to check this information, because you often may be surprised
by what additional dependencies your libraries bring.
</p><p>
If the library versions are close, usually reflected in the same major number, there probably
isn't a big problem. It's not uncommon for deployment and development
machines to have incompatible versions if you're deploying to an
externally hosted Web site.
</p><p>
The solution I use is to compile my own local version of
the library. Remove the shared version of the library, and link
against this local version rather than the system version. It bulks
up your binary, but it removes your dependency on libraries you
don't control.
</p><p>
Once you have built your binary on the deployment system, run
<tt  >ldd</tt>
again to make sure that all of the dynamic libraries have been found.
Especially when you are linking against a local copy of a library,
it's easy to forget to remove the dynamic version, which won't be
found at runtime (or by <tt  >ldd</tt>). Keep tweaking the build process; build
and recheck until there are no unfound libraries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x135bee8"></a>
Speed: CGI vs. PHP</h2></div></div><p>
Conventional wisdom holds that a program using the CGI
interface is slower than a program using a language provided by
a server module, such as mod_php or mod_perl. Because I started
writing Web applications with PHP, I use it here as my basis for
comparison with a CGI program written in C. I make no assertions
about the relative speed of C vs. Perl.
</p><p>
The comparison that I used was the external interface to the database
(events.cgi and events.php), because both used the same method for providing
interface separation. The internal interface was not tested, as
calls to the external interface should dwarf calls to the internal.
</p><p>
Apache Benchmark was used to hit each version with 10,000 queries,
as fast as the server could take it. The C version had a mean
transaction time of 581ms, and the PHP version had a mean
transaction time of 601ms. With times so close, I suspect that if
the tests were repeated, some variation in time would be seen. This
proved correct, although the C version was slightly faster than the PHP
version more times
than not.
</p><p>
My normal development uses a more complex interface separation
library, libtemplate (see Resources). I
have PHP and C versions of the library. When I compared versions of
the event scheduler using libtemplate, I found that C had a much more
favorable response time. The mean transaction time for the C version
was 625ms, not much more than it was for the simpler version. The PHP version
had a mean transaction time of 1,957ms. It also was notable that the
load number while the PHP version was running generally was twice what
was seen while the C version was running. No users were on the
system, and no other significant applications were running when this test
was done.
</p><p>
The fairly close times of the two C versions tell us that most of the
execution time is spent loading the program. Once the program is
loaded, the program executes quite quickly. PHP, on the other hand,
executes relatively slowly. Of course, PHP doesn't escape the problem
of having to be loaded into memory. It also must be compiled, a step
that the C program has been through already.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126b580.0x135c150"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
With the right tools and a little experience, developing CGI applications with C is no
more difficult than it is when using Perl or PHP. Now that I have the experience and
the tools, C is my preferred language for CGI applications.
</p><p>
C excels when the application requires more advanced processing and
long-term stability. It is not especially susceptible to failure when
server changes are beyond your control, unlike PHP. Short of
removing a shared library, such as libc or libmysqlclient, the C
version of our application is hard to break. The speed of execution
for C programs makes it a clear choice when the application requires
more complex data processing.
