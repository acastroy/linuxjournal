Ssh! Everybody Look Professional!</h4><p>
People &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; understand that Linux is
perfectly appropriate for the enterprise. However,
there are many circles that still think of
Linux as a hobbyist project. Consultants such
as myself face an up-hill battle when pushing
Linux-based solutions. I believe our job is made
more difficult when one of the few Linux-focused
periodicals actually to make it to the local magazine
racks prominently displays the powerful operating
system's ability to act as a Web-based cat feeder.
I appreciated the article, but did it have to go on
the cover?

Happy Birthday, Patrick</h4><p>
As a subscriber of <i  >Linux Journal</i> since 1994, I have
been following all the great pictures of newborns, who
get their first introduction to Linux on the pages of
your great publication. When my son Patrick arrived
on October 23, 2004, I knew I had to start him
off with penguins as soon as possible. So, on his
first-month birthday, my wife snapped this picture
to show that a new Linux hacker is on his way to help
in the Open Source community.

64-Bit Porting, Please</h4><p>
As I am currently hacking my way through this
myself...I would really like to see an article on
building software (compiling) for the AMD64. There
are certain pointer symantics and sizing issues that
need to be dealt with, and I have yet to find a good

Laptop Comparisons, Please</h4><p>
In the January 2005 issue, you have a nice review of
the HP laptop. I do not mean to be too critical,
but it seems to me that you have given us half a loaf.
We do not buy such things in a vacuum. There are
other Linux boxes out there, such as from Emperor
or even Lindows, Wal-Mart, sub300 (ugh), etc.
</p><p>
It would help me a great deal if a review would
describe not only the object under discussion, but also
include some comments about whether it is &ldquo;better
than&rdquo;, in almost any way you choose to evaluate it,
some other machine. Is is a better buy than the
equivalent box from Emperor? Where does it fit in,
in the long scale of very cheap to very expensive,
versus quality. I think the reader would be better
served with such information, even if it is only your
best guess. Because (I hope) you have a lot better
data base to go on than I do.
Many thanks for a good magazine.

After hinting for the last four and a half years of

Unicode Question</h4><p>
Thanks for your article in the December 2004 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> about
aggregating feeds, I really enjoyed it. It's probably
months since you wrote the article, but I've only
just got around to reading it over the Xmas break!
I don't know Python, but managed to tinker with your code and get my
own feeds page going (<a href="http://snowfrog.net/myfeeds.html" target="_self">snowfrog.net/myfeeds.html</a>).
</p><p>
I'm getting an error when I syndicate some sites,
such as <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/rss" target="_self">safari.oreilly.com/rss</a>, and I don't
know how to fix it. Any pointers? Obviously, it involves
stripping out non-ASCII chars, or changing the codec
to Unicode, but I don't know how to do that (yet):

<pre     class="programlisting">
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xae' in
position 66: ordinal not in range(128)
</pre>
</p><p>
This occurs when (for example) I do a
<tt  >sys.stderr.write(mystring)</tt>.
Thanks for any help you can give.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Sonia Hamilton  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Reuven Lerner replies:</b></span>
I'm glad that you enjoyed the article! And yes, I normally write
columns about 3&ndash;4 months before they are printed&mdash;but I do remember
writing about feedparser and aggregating feeds.
</p><p>
Hmm, I'm a bit surprised that something is choking on Unicode characters.
That shouldn't happen, should it? And for feedparser to be choking is
even weirder, because I was sure that it could handle Unicode just fine.
But the problem isn't the Unicode string. Rather, it has to do with the
fact that the Unicode string isn't being translated into a non-ASCII
codec, which is what you guessed.
For example, consider the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

 &gt;&gt;&gt; print u'\xae'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in ?
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xae' in
position 0: ordinal not in range(128)

 &gt;&gt;&gt; print u'\xae'.encode('utf-8')
&reg;

</pre>
</p><p>
So you (or the feedparser source; it's not clear if the problem is in
code that you wrote or in the feedparser code) probably should include a
call to encode, indicating the resulting codec.
</p><p>
I haven't read it very carefully, but the feedparser documentation
includes a description of encoding systems. It might well be that
you're being bitten by something there
(<a href="http://www.feedparser.org/docs/character-encoding.html" target="_self">www.feedparser.org/docs/character-encoding.html</a>).
I hope that this helps! Please let me know if you have any further
questions.

GPG Fingerprints</h4><p>
I read you rolled out GPG for everybody at SSC.
How about adding the key fingerprints in the journal
itself as an example to give validity to the keys.
You list all the collaborators on page 4 with the
e-mail addresses, this would be a nice spot to add
the fingerprints.
The only drawback would be the space it takes.
Better: create a master key, sign all the keys with
the master, and print the fingerprint of the master.
Keep up the good work with the magazine, I am now the owner of 50cm
of magazines. And my best wishes for 2005 to you and the whole team.

Dependency Hunting, S'il Vous Pla&icirc;t</h4><p>
I appreciate Marcel Gagn&eacute; and his monthly column,
particularly because it is the only one in <i  >LJ</i> that I
can consistently understand. But, why does he feel
it necessary (or useful) to repeat the same five-step
build process for every piece of software? It's only
useful if it compiles with no problems&mdash;and we all
know that never happens. Anyone capable of hunting
down dependencies certainly knows the build process.
</p><p>
I have a proposal for Marcel and Francois: how about a column devoted
specifically to the compile process? I am particularly interested in
knowing about common dependency issues, common paths to specify, and why
and how to install dependencies in a different directory so they can
coexist with other, default versions of the same software. I am
running Xandros 2.0, which uses an older version of KDE (and many other
things). I would love to be able to install software that requires KDE
3.3, but upgrading to that would certainly wreck my OS. There must be a
way to install dependencies in parallel, with the more advanced versions
to be used only by the programs that I specifically point to them, but I
have no idea how to go about this.

Letters to the Mainstream Media</h4><p>
I was looking in the local rag, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Daily

the editorial column:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Microsoft Windows is a terrible
product. If Windows were a commercial aircraft, the FAA would ground it.
If it were a prescription drug, the FDA would ban it. If it were a
horse, you'd shoot it. Every new Windows release is miles worse than the

more desperately. Microsoft Windows wants to kill you.
</p><p>
But yet we're all stuck with it. We all depend on it, completely and

Try Knoppix on CD. It comes with everything you

Kernel IPSec History</h4><p>
The article &ldquo;Linux VPN Technologies&rdquo; [February 2005]
discusses IPSec and its availability in the 2.6 series
kernel. It states that FreeS/WAN is available in the
kernel, when in fact the 2.6 kernel uses a port of
the KAME IPSec stack (<a href="http://www.kame.net" target="_self">www.kame.net</a>). The KAME
stack was originally developed for the BSD variants
and is very mature. The utilities for interacting
with this stack, called ipsec-tools, can be found at
<a href="http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net</a>. I'm successfully
using the 2.6 IPSec stack for a custom wireless access
point using hostap. Thanks for the excellent work.

More Innovative Apps, Please</h4><p>
I have been a Linux advocate for many years and
continue to marvel at the progress it has made.
Several leaps have brought Linux much more into
the mainstream of business and even home users in
recent years.
</p><p>
It seems that many applications are not innovative,
but just copies of other ideas from other platforms.
While it is important that critical areas be filled
with appropriate applications in order to make Linux
viable for users, it is also important to innovate.
That being said, will users move to Linux for the
same applications that they can get on other systems?
Probably, because of cost savings. But, more users
would move faster to Linux if there are applications
that are innovative.
</p><p>
I remember in the mid-1980s when a small company was
able to capture nearly 25% of the PC market despite
having more expensive products. A simple change to
the user interface that used graphics in place of
menus made all the difference.
</p><p>
So, as I flip thought the last several issues of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, I have yet to see many innovative
applications. As more people become interested in
Linux for its reliable and highly customizable
features, will there be an incentive to switch
other than cost? Without innovative applications,
it could relegate Linux to remain in the back office
in the hands of the techies.

NLD as Seen by a Novell User</h4><p>
Just before reading the latest issue [February 2005], I was thinking
to myself that <i  >LJ</i> really hasn't yet acknowledged that
Novell is now one of the major players in the Linux
world. And then there was your review of Novell Linux
Desktop (which as I'm sure others have told you by
now is NLD not NDS). As a longtime Novell user and
a longtime Linux user I was happy that Novell took
the steps it did. Like everyone else I was keeping
my fingers crossed that they wouldn't screw up like
they did when the acquired WordPerfect and sold UNIX
to SCO. So far they haven't made any major blunders.
</p><p>
Initially, the emphasis was on a good server kernel to
replace NetWare, which although still quite capable,
isn't as good as Linux in many areas. Of course
Novell just couldn't resist competing with Microsoft
by pushing Linux on the desktop. NLD isn't bad,
but it offers little advantage over any of the
other distributions. Novell is positioning NLD
as a business desktop.
</p><p>
In their rush to get NLD out the door, they didn't
get all the pieces in place to integrate NLD
into an existing Novell network, so most established
NetWare shops aren't finding it very useful either. I
don't even think ncpfs (needed to mount NetWare
volumes) came installed by default. I know GroupWise
didn't, even though they have a pretty good Linux
version. Evolution 2 is the default mail program but
none of the GroupWise hooks are working yet. Those
are waiting on the next version of GroupWise due
out mid-year. The reset of the integration part
is waiting on Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES), now in beta.
Supposedly, it will have a true NetWare
client akin to the the Win32 client. Time will tell.
</p><p>
Novell is a major player in the Linux world now,
and we should accept that fact and work with
them. They are very open-minded right now and will
benefit from interaction with people that have been
around Linux a lot longer then they have. I'd encourage
you to attend Brainshare this year. Linus was there
last year. As always, <i  >LJ</i> is great and continues to
get better. Thanks for the good work.

Cruelty-Free Advertising, Please</h4><p>
I used to be a subscriber to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Magazine</em></span> until
the Microsoft ads started appearing a few years ago.
I was sickened and stunned. I stopped dead still in
my tracks with feelings of anger and realizations
of betrayal. I really used to look forward to the
monthly delivery of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LM</em></span>, but I was left staggered and
emotionally confused at the sight of Microsoft's ugly
and sudden appearance. There was a sinister happiness
about the ad, and it felt very much as if the magazine
I was holding contained a plague that began infecting
my hands. I could feel the hate and cruelty making
its black way up both my arms...going for my soul...trying to turn me into its Golem. Even as the
magazine slammed against the wall across the room,
I still felt sick, and angry, and sad, and betrayed.
It was a really tough day for me.
</p><p>
<i  >Linux Journal</i> is the only Linux magazine I subscribe
to now. If something should happen to you guys...where else could I go?

Security Blanket?</h4><p>
My home office is in the basement of my Wisconsin

winter, so my wife surprised me with a blanket she made
to help keep me warm as I use my Linux workstation.

A mid-winter kite flying event called &ldquo;Kites on Ice&rdquo;

root Password Management</h4><p>
May I interject a thought regarding the comments made
in the January 2005 <i  >LJ</i> [Best of Technical Support,
&ldquo;Distributing /etc/shadow&rdquo;, p. 68]?
While possibly more than was originally requested, one
of the other options available instead of constantly
changing the root password would be to use the SecurID
system (and ACE Server) that is sold by RSA Security.
It gives you a variation on &ldquo;one-time passwords&rdquo;
and in a lot of cases can satisfy the MIL-Spec that
requires rotating the root passwords.
However, in practice, locking out the root password
and using <tt  >sudo</tt> for everything (which can also use
SecurID) is a much smarter idea. It provides auditing
as a side benefit.

Open Access to Archives, Please</h4><p>
Please put my vote in the &ldquo;liked open access better&rdquo;
category. I subscribe to make <i  >Linux Journal</i>
possible and to have a hard copy in my hand every
month. It doesn't bother me that someone else may be
getting it free off the Web. I think that requiring
a subscription to get full content is passing up the
opportunity to provide a service. Let me give you
an example.
</p><p>
I've been asked to do a piece for IEEE Software. So
while researching past issues to find the appropriate
tone for the audience, I found that there's a lot
of good stuff there that I (and others like me)
don't have access to because we don't get the
subscription. As a result, we're less informed
than we might be. Publications that do that may be
protecting their copyrights and business model at
the cost of their community being less informed.
Even as a subscriber I'd be happier if the average
Linux user was better informed.
</p><p>
The last time I checked, the European Linux magazines
offered free access to content that was over a year
old. If allowing access to older content (for some
small value of &ldquo;older&rdquo;) will satisfy the original
objectors, I can live with that.
</p><p>
I will keep my subscription whether you choose to
change the subscriber-only policy or keep it. In either
case, I get what I want and what I paid for. I think
that open Web access to content is a valuable extra
to me and the community.

California last August (donated by Google).
</p><p>
We were on nearby Koh Samed (Samed Island) the next
day when the tsunami hit. Luckily, both Rayong and
Koh Samed are in the Gulf of Thailand, not on the Bay
of Bengal. We noticed nothing more than a 3&ndash;4 foot surf,
slightly larger than normal.

What Was the Bug?</h4><p>
I am very curious about the &ldquo;Horrible Bug&rdquo;
referenced in the diff -u section of the February
2005 <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I have just purchased SuSE
Linux Professional, Release 9.2, which contains the
2.6.8 kernel. A description of the bug would help
to determine if my specific system would in any way
be impacted.

<span   class="bold"><b>Zack Brown replies:</b></span> The bug was with NFS. Entering a mounted NFS directory would result in an
OOPS under the 2.6.8 Linux kernel. Only folks using NFS would experience
a problem.
</p><p>
Regarding SuSE Pro 9.2, you can put your mind at ease, the fix is
included. All Linux distributions, SuSE, Debian, Red Hat and the
rest, apply various patches to their kernels before release. In fact,
in recent days the kernel developers have come to rely on vendor patches
more explicitly, as a crucial element of the stabilization process. The
2.6.8 kernel included in the SuSE Pro 9.2 release is not a
&ldquo;true&rdquo; 2.6.8
kernel, it is more like a 2.6.9-rc2 kernel with further additions. One
of these additions clears up the NFS oops problem found in the official
2.6.8 kernel.

Question on Serial Ports</h4><p>
I particularly enjoyed Chris McAvoy's article in
the January 2005 issue entitled &ldquo;How I Feed My Cats with
Linux&rdquo;. I do have one question though. He makes the
point that the BASIC Stamp uses a nonstandard serial
port and specifically points out that Parallax's
method makes two-way communication difficult. This
seems a valid reason for replacement, except that
I can't find any instances in the sample code where
two-way communication is actually used. Did I miss
something? For the purpose of the given example,
wouldn't the onboard serial suffice? I do appreciate
that this is but one example of the possibilities
of this kit and can see where two-way communication
would be useful, just not in this case.
</p><p>
I would like to commend this article and ask for more
like it, as I am interested in data acquisition and
digital I/O controls for some future projects that
I am planning, and currently <i  >LJ</i> is my only link to
the computer world until 2008. Which brings me to a
final question for the subscription department. I am
a longtime subscriber, but the last couple of years,
I have been receiving my <i  >LJ</i> while incarcerated in
a California State prison, and I wonder, are there
any other inmate subscribers? I've run into very few
computer geeks like myself in prison, and not a single
Linux enthusiast, so my curiosity is piqued.
</p><p>
Thanks to the entire <i  >LJ</i> staff for their hard work in
putting out a fine publication.

<span   class="bold"><b>Chris McAvoy replies:</b></span> thanks for writing. You're right about not necessarily needing the
MAX232 for one-way serial communication to the STAMP. Given the way
we're using the STAMP, we could have just used the built-in serial
port. That said, it was nice during testing to be able to run the DEBUG
command in my PBASIC code, and see the output live on the console. If
we used the built-in port, it would be more difficult to debug. Plus,
the MAX232 kit is really slick, and relatively inexpensive.
</p><p>
Yes, there are other subscribers
in prison, but we can't give out the exact number.  &mdash;Ed.

An Epistle
for General Release</h4><p>
The New Bedford Monthly Meeting of Friends met this
second day of January 2005 and resolved to declare
our recognition of the good that free software is
doing in the world and to thank those who have shared
the fruit of their labor.
</p><p>
We single out this activity for the following reasons.
</p><p>
That our Meeting uses these products for
administrative purposes and that we hope to soon use
them to help others. This is our thank-you note.
</p><p>
That those who are doing this work might better
realize their own Light. We see Godliness in their
actions and by drawing their attention to that
Godliness may we let them feel it more strongly.
</p><p>
That people generally may know of and use this
software and save their resources for other needs.
</p><p>
The society at large, and especially those who
regulate, legislate, or adjudicate, may note the
public good done by such sharing of intellectual
property. Society should look kindly on this sharing,
a sharing which its laws seem ill suited to promote.
</p><p>
In using the words free software we mean software
which is put in the public domain or is released with
conditions that ensure that any interested person
may have, use, improve, and redistribute the software.
