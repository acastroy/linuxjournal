With UpStage, the next theater is only a mouse click
away.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21ca348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Writers, musicians, painters, filmmakers and artists of every kind are
using the Web as a platform. Only one traditional art form does not have
a strong presence in cyberspace yet&mdash;theater. But, as soon as one
is willing to adapt to the medium, a new art form evolves,
cyberformance.
</p><p>
The term cyberformance was coined by New Zealand performance artist Helen Varley
Jamieson to describe &ldquo;performance
that uses the Internet to bring remote performers
together, in real time, in a live theatrical
event&rdquo;. She has been working for several years with
the cyberformance troupe Avatar Body Collision,
using free Internet chat applications to create
performances in cyberspace. To provide her, her
coperformers and their audience with a Web-based
stage, she initiated an open-source project called UpStage,
written by Douglas Bagnall (see the on-line Resources). The
first release, launched in January 2004, was funded
by the New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science and
Technology and Creative New Zealand, and funds now are
being sought to continue its development.
</p><p>
Of course, the software isn't restricted to on-line
performances. UpStage also makes an interesting tool for
on-line teaching, as well as product and other types of
presentations. It even serves as a collaboration tool for virtual
workgroups. UpStage's strength is its user-friendly and
highly accessible interface: players and audience
alike need to have nothing more than a standard browser and
Internet connection to participate. Newbies can
learn the basics and find themselves happily
text-rapping and avatar-hopping in no time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21ca558"></a>
Your Theater Needs Careful Planning</h2></div></div><p>
The server software itself is written in
Python and comes with its own Web server,
giving artists the opportunity to set up a stage easily, wherever their
laptop is located on-line. Apart from the Web server,
which requires the Python Twisted framework,
the software makes extensive use of other
open-source programs commonly installed on Linux systems,
such as the text-to-speech-system Festival,
the netpbm tools and gif2png. See the Problems with GIFs sidebar to
this article for more details.
</p><p>
Often not shipped with Linux distributions are swfttools and the MP3 encoder
lame. The timeout program from The Coroner's Toolkit, which is used
during speech synthesis, also generally is not included. But it usually can be
omitted if one isn't afraid to touch the source code.
</p><p>
The stage is a Flash client, and here is where
the swfttools enter the picture. They convert the
PNGs and JPEGs used both for stage decoration and as
avatars into Flash format. Hence, performers and audience alike need the
Macromedia Flash plugin for their Web browsers. KHTML- and Mozilla-based
browsers work fine, but at present, Opera isn't suitable.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the current version of
UpStage does not honor PATH settings. Therefore, it is wise
to check whether all the above-mentioned programs are
situated in one of the directories that are hard-compiled
into /bin/sh:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ strings /bin/sh | grep -E "/(bin|sbin)"
[...]
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:
/sbin:/bin
</pre>
</p><p>
If not, appropriate links should be set. Otherwise, error hunting can
become tricky, as UpStage isn't good at providing meaningful error messages in
every situation. Things become even more complicated when using the
sound tools. Despite UpStage using graphics tools in /usr/local/bin,
it doesn't necessarily find lame there. So for users who aren't up to
hacking the source, creating a link named /usr/bin/lame seems unavoidable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21ca818"></a>
Setting Up the Theater</h2></div></div><p>
Now it is time to start the server. Unpack the source archive,
Upstage-2004-09-28.tar.gz, and enter the newly created Upstage
directory. Here, you find the shell script go.sh that tries
to kill an old twisted-server mentioned in the
file Upstage/twistd.pid and starts a new one.
So, don't worry about the relevant error message
when you run <tt  >./go.sh</tt> as a nonprivileged user for
the first time. It's only then that Upstage creates the pid-file.
</p><p>
For security reasons, it is not advisable to run
UpStage as root. That's why the server uses an
unprivileged port above 1024. The port on which your
UpStage server runs can be configured. If
you dislike the default port 8081, change the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
WEB_PORT  =  8081
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21caa28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in Upstage/upstage/config.py, and re-run
<tt  >./go.sh</tt>.
</p><p>
Because the September 2004 version of UpStage is missing
the directory that the server uses to store
temporary MP3 files, you can save yourself a lot
of trouble if you create it by hand:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir html/speech
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, point your local Web browser to
the following: http://localhost:8081/, and you should end up at
the entrance to your theater (Figure 1). To customize
it according to your needs, change its HTML code in
Upstage/html/index.html and the corresponding
stylesheet, Upstage/html/style/main.css. It's
a good idea to keep the relative link <tt  >"&lt;a
href="/stages"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"</tt> to the stages&mdash;your audience
will be grateful&mdash;and the login for the artists.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7981f1.large.jpg"><img src="7981f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The default entrance hall clearly shows
the origin of the software.
</p></div></div><p>
The theater also has a back door for its personnel.
The URLs http://localhost:8081/admin and
http://localhost:8081/login.html lead you
directly to a login dialog that can be changed in
Upstage/html/login.html.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21caef8"></a>
Hiring Personnel</h2></div></div><p>
The name of UpStage's default theater
director is z, and z has no password. You probably want to
change this, so log in and enter the theater's
director. Using the Add a new player link, go
to http://localhost:8081/admin/new/player
and add the name and password of the new director. To
make him or her the big boss who can hire
and fire, make sure you tick the permission to
Add or Remove Players (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7981f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. <i >LJ</i> becomes a big boss.
</p></div></div><p>
This new player is written to the user
configuration file, Upstage/config/players.xml,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;player password="551a9c1c68844936b0d182080fe7dcc0"
 name="lj" rights="act,admin,su"&gt;
&lt;/player&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The password attribute doesn't contain the actual
password, which is upstage for this example, but its md5sum. If you want
to add users using your favorite text editor,
you can generate the password like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo -n "upstage" | md5sum
551a9c1c68844936b0d182080fe7dcc0  -
</pre>
</p><p>
The name attribute contains the user name of the
player, and you can grant up to three rights. The
big boss needs the su right. Everyone who is
supposed to create and edit things that can be seen
and used on stage needs the admin permission, and all players
need the right to act.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the Web front end is quite buggy
when it comes to deleting and editing users. It
doesn't show you the correct rights, it doesn't allow
you to change them (not even with superuser power)
and it doesn't let you delete users. If you
click the check box before the relevant user entry in
http://localhost:8081/admin/edit/player/ and press the
Remove Players as a superuser button, UpStage removes the
relevant player until the end of the session but
doesn't delete him or her from players.xml. After restarting
the server, all the players are alive and kicking again.
Douglas Bagnall promised to fix this bug soon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21cb420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Problems with GIFs</b></p><p>
Even if you have installed gif2png properly, the
September 2004 version of UpStage can't convert GIF
pictures for use as avatars, props or backgrounds.
Until a new version is available, you can fix this
bug yourself by uncommenting line 38 in Upstage/img2swf.py
and deleting <tt  >"giftopnm" flag "--background
"#fff""</tt> in line 63. The relevant lines then should
read as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[...]
35 def do_gif(tfn, swf):
[...]
38 #    os.path.remove(png)
[...]
57 def thumbnailer(filetype, tfn, thumb, log):
[...]
63           'image/gif'      :     'giftopnm %s |
pnmscale -height=10 | pnmtojpeg &gt; %s'
</pre>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21cb688"></a>
Fixing Up Roles and Props</h2></div></div><p>
These problems with users and permissions don't appear with the
inventory of your theater. You can add and edit stages, avatars (an
avatar complies with a character in your performance in one
disguise),backdrops or stage designs and props using the workshop
http://localhost:8081/admin/ URL.
The latter can be carried by your avatar, and they always
appear in the upper-left portion of the avatar, such as the
blue bubbles attached to the bomb in Figure 6.
</p><p>
When creating new avatars, props and backdrops, you
have some choices: two-dimensional pictures, Flash animations
and video streams. Be careful with moving pictures, however; they require
bandwidth and are real performance killers.
</p><p>
Video streams must be available locally and should be stored in
Upstage/html/media/. For Linux,
the UpStage user manual recommends webcamd
as the software to use to upload a video stream by way of
FTP. Unfortunately, webcamd's original project site seems to be closed
(see Resources), but it still is available both as a binary and as a
source archive from Debian servers.
</p><p>
Differing from real-world theater, an
avatar, backdrop or prop can be assigned
to multiple stages simultaneously. This is
done in the Manage an existing stage section
(http://localhost:8081/admin/edit/stage/&lt;stagename&gt;/,
Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7981f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Although the inventory names are
clickable, these links don't lead to the edit
dialog for the relevant item but instead point to the
Flash file.
</p></div></div><p>
The configuration data for the stages are stored
in XML format in Upstage/config/stages.xml and
Upstage/config/stages/&lt;stage-id&gt;/config.xml. The
first file lists all available stages; each of the
latter holds information about the inventory
assigned to the appropriate stage.
</p><p>
Needless to say, the three types of inventory
have their own text configuration files, namely
Upstage/config/props.xml, avatars.xml and
backdrops.xml. They all follow the structure
shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x21cbb00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

&lt;/avatar&gt;

file="clock.swf" thumbnail="/media/thumb/clock.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/avatar&gt;
&lt;/avatars&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Although the name of the root element does not
actually matter, UpStage uses avatars,
props and swamp, respectively, when generating
the files. What matters is the name of the
sub-elements: avatar, prop and backdrop. Each
sub-element has four mandatory attributes plus one optional
attribute, as described in Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x25c3f60"></a><p class="title"><b>

Choose the
http://localhost:8081/admin/edit/avatar/ link from
the workshop and click the name of the relevant
item to edit an existing avatar. The appropriate dialog (Figure 4) leaves
you with two options, to change the item's name
and voice.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7981f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Edit dialog of this avatar doesn't
tell you this penguin is so big that it takes up
almost the entire screen.
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, this dialog is of little help when it
comes to estimating the size of the picture on
stage. The UpStage client renders backdrops
to fit the size of the browser window,
while props and avatars appear about three
times their original dimensions. The user manual (see Resources)
contains a section with recommendations for sizes and formats
for creating graphics.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x25c4900"></a>
Making Noise</h2></div></div><p>
When it comes to voice definitions, one no longer
has to deal with XML&mdash;now it's Python. The file
Upstage/upstage/config.py contains a section, actually a dictionary
object, called VOICES that defines the commands used in text-to-speech
synthesis (Listing 2). Having said this, UpStage
speech generation does not depend on Festival
exclusively. This is especially important
for non-English speakers, because the Festival
distribution as is limits itself to English.
</p><p>
If you want to add new voices, simply start a new
line inside the curly braces following the VOICES
keyword. Type the name of the new voice in single
quote marks and add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
: ("| ", _fest),
</pre>
</p><p>
Make sure you start the line with as many
whitespaces as needed to place your opening single
quote directly below the beginning of the other
voice definitions. Python is picky about
indentations, and incorrect indentations mean that
UpStage stops working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x25c4b10"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Voice Definitions in config.py
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
VOICES = {
          'kal': ("| timeout 15 text2wave -eval
'(voice_kal_diphone)' -otype raw",
                 _fest),
         [...]
         }
</pre></div><p>
Following the pipe character (|), enter
whatever command (pipeline) you like, provided it
reads text from stdin and provides 16kHz raw PCM
output on stdout. To test it, issue the following
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo "Say something in the relevant language" |
&lt;command&gt; | timeout 15 lame -S -x -m s -r -s 16
--resample 22.05 --preset phone - /tmp/test.mp3

</pre>
</p><p>
If an MP3 player playing the resulting
/tmp/test.mp3 file says what it is meant to say, insert
your command into config.py. Because UpStage is
particular about paths,
make sure you're using absolute paths in this file.
</p><p>
The original config.py file contains more
text-to-speech commands than probably will work with your
installation. Because all of them appear in the voice
drop-down menu when adding or editing an avatar, it is
wise to comment them out using the # sign. Notice that
with the original voice definitions, you have to
comment out two or three lines per item. If you miss
one, you receive an error message such as this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Failed to load application: invalid syntax
(config.py, line 92)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x25c4e80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
when restarting the server using <tt  >./go.sh</tt> in
order to activate the changes.
</p><p>
If all of your avatars lose their voices after this,
you probably commented out the default voice
definition as well. Bad idea! It's perfectly fine to
redefine the command behind the default entry,
but you must not leave UpStage without having one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d2580.0x25c5038"></a>
Rehearsal Time</h2></div></div><p>
When your stage is prepared, it is time to start
rehearsing. This means all players need to log in
and enter the relevant stage using the Stages
link, http://localhost:8081/stages/, in the workshop.
Once in, they at first find a big empty space,
the stage, surrounded by the chat window to the
right where all uttered text can be read. An
image gallery is located beneath the chat window.
Clicking one of the backdrop icons in the left part
of the image gallery changes the stage design. The
right part holds the props (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7981f5.large.jpg"><img src="7981f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. When choosing backdrops, one needs to consider that the
outer-right portion will be obscured by the chat window.
</p></div></div><p>
Above the chat window users see a button bar that
mainly serves to control avatars. The characters
themselves can be found in the wardrobe above
the buttons on the right-hand side. Here users
find thumbnails of all avatars activated for this
stage. If you click one of them, it appears
in the mirror to the left of the wardrobe.
Hence, a glimpse in the mirror always shows you
which role you are playing.
</p><p>
But, your character can't be seen on stage at once.
If you type some text in the input field below the
chat window, your avatar acts as a voice-over.
When you first click on the stage window, the avatar
appears there and its utterances can be read
as balloons (Figure 5). Whether UpStage
shows the avatar's name as text on stage can be triggered by
using the pink name button.
</p><p>
When you click elsewhere on stage, your avatar moves
slowly there. If you want it to jump there at once,
click the green fast button first; the orange
slow button brings you back into slow-motion mode.
To bring the character to a full stop
use the red stop button.
</p><p>
To equip your avatar with a prop, click the appropriate
thumbnail in the right part of the image gallery
below the stage window. It then follows your avatar
in all its movements.
</p><p>
When you click another thumbnail in the wardrobe,
your old character remains on stage but can be
overtaken by your coplayers. When the avatar
you currently hold needs to leave the stage,
use the yellow drop button. At the moment, this
also is the only way to get rid of a prop. Even
though it is possible to change props by clicking
another prop icon&mdash;although this is not done entirely without
side effects&mdash;this current UpStage version has no &ldquo;get
rid of prop&rdquo; button yet.
</p><p>
The gray clear button empties the stage except
for the avatars your coplayers are holding. The
entire operation, however, has a side effect: before
your coplayers can move their characters again,
they have to reselect them in the wardrobe.
</p><p>
Sometimes it might seem as though things haven't disappeared from the
stage. In most cases, a browser reload helps, but then you need to
grab your avatar again.
</p><p>
When for some reason you need to start from scratch, you can use
the red reset button. This should not be done during a performance
or when others are on the same stage, as it dramatically throws everyone
off and requires a browser reload. Some players even may need to log in
again. Moving the reset button to a less-tempting location is on the
priority fix list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7981f6.large.jpg"><img src="7981f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. To applaud or to hoot, the audience can
type into the chat.
</p></div></div><p>
If not logged in, one sees the stage and the
chat window only (Figure 6). This however, doesn't
mean the audience has no voice. Everything
non-actors type in can be seen by everyone in
the chat window, which makes UpStage a brilliant
choice for on-line teaching and presentations. You can
choose to respond or ignore the audience comments. The only differences
are the audience text appears in gray font, without an avatar name
attached, and it isn't spoken aloud. Hence the applause in
UpStage is silent.
</p><p>You can try it out even without installing
UpStage. Every month Avatar Body Collision offers
an open session for those interested in
sampling and learning more about performing interactively with
UpStage. Watch out for the next
date (see Resources). Additional
help is available through the user manual and the
mailing list.
