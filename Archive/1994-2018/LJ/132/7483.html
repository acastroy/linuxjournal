LifeKeeper for Linux is a high-availability clustering software package
from Steeleye Technology, Inc. Steeleye acquired LifeKeeper when NCR spun
off the technology, originally developed by AT&amp;T Bell Labs.
Steeleye ported LifeKeeper to Linux as well as to other operating systems. Version
4.4.3 supports failover for communications resources, databases,
filesystems and mail, print and Web servers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7483f1.large.jpg"><img src="7483f1.jpg"></a></div><p>
Steeleye refers to the type of high
availability provided by LifeKeeper as fault resilience, the ability to
recover from a failure automatically. This is differentiated from the
idea of fault tolerance, where the system continues to operate after a
failure occurs.
</p><p>
LifeKeeper is supported on various Linux distributions, including
Red Hat, SuSE, UnitedLinux and Miracle Linux. The minimum system
requirements for LifeKeeper are a supported Linux distribution running
on an Intel-based server, 64MB of RAM and approximately 10MB of local
disk space. Data protection is achieved by using either shared storage
with SCSI or Fibre Channel or non-shared storage using LifeKeeper Data
Replication.
</p><p>
The LifeKeeper software contains of a set of core
applications and is extended by application-specific recovery kits (ARKs). The
installation support and core applications package installed the software
base. This included binaries and configuration files for the graphical and
command-line interfaces, recovery support for the operating system, filesystems, SCSI subsystem, processor, memory, IP address and raw I/O. It
also included an on-line help system and man pages. Application
recovery kits are available for Apache Web server, data replication, IBM DB2, Informix,
Logical Volume Manager, MySQL, NAS, NFS, Oracle, PostgreSQL, print
services, SAMBA, SAP and Sendmail.
</p><p>
The software is licensed per server
and per recovery kit. A cluster of two servers requires two licenses
for the core application and two additional licenses for each of the
application recovery kits. For instance, to protect a pair of LAMP Web
application servers, licenses are required for the core application,
plus Apache and MySQL application recovery kits. Although licensing costs can
mount up quickly, it does allow you to pay for only what you need.
</p><p>
I began my review of LifeKeeper for Linux by reading the product
documentation, taking the on-line tutorial and attending a Web-based
seminar. This is a well-documented product. The CD-ROMs I received from
Steeleye contained a planning and installation manual, a configuration
guide and manuals for each of the application recovery kits. The
documentation was available on the Web as well as in PDF format. The on-line tutorial
was fairly basic and covered the same information as the manuals.
</p><p>
The seminar consisted of a marketing presentation
and a live demonstration of LifeKeeper. I felt that the presentation and
demonstration would be useful to anyone starting to look into
the product. If you're looking to introduce LifeKeeper into your
business,
it may be useful to have managers and coworkers attend the seminar. The
live question-and-answer session was the best part. I encourage anyone
interested in the product to review the tutorial and on-line documentation
and compile a list of questions to submit during the seminar.
</p><p>
Some flexibility exists in the cluster configuration, so it is a
good idea to spend some time considering what hardware, applications
and services you want to protect. As a minimum, you should consider
server hardware, storage options, communications path, failover model,
protected applications and services. Steeleye is positioning LifeKeeper
as a commodity product. As such, it should support most reasonable
server configurations. Nevertheless, they have certified some hardware
and provide guidelines for verifying LifeKeeper with uncertified hardware.
Certified hardware vendors include Dell, HP and IBM.
In fact, you can include the LifeKeeper software when purchasing systems
from them.
</p><p>
Multiple storage options are available to choose from. Shared
storage consists of a SCSI or Fibre Channel array that is connected
to both systems in the cluster. Data is located on the shared array.
LifeKeeper's locking mechanism prevents the standby system from accessing
the partition while the active system is in service. The data-replication
option enables data stored on the local disks of one system to be mirrored
to another system. The network-attached storage option facilitates
the use of volumes mounted from an NFS server or NAS device. For instances
in which the data is static, such as Web servers, there is an option to not
share or replicate the data store.
</p><p>
A central concept of LifeKeeper,
as with most high-availability solutions, is the system heartbeat.
One server sends a signal to the other to determine system and application
health. Heartbeat communication path options include serial port and
LAN. It is a good idea to use multiple paths, such as serial and LAN or
multiple LAN connections. The failover models include active/active,
active/standby and N+1. In active/active configuration, each server in the
cluster is providing its own set of applications and services. If one
fails, the other takes over. Users may experience some degradation of
services, because the remaining system is serving both sets of applications
and services, although it does allow for maximum resource utilization.
</p><p>
Active/standby provides the best continuity of service after a failure.
However, it requires a redundant system and the associated cost. In N+1
configuration, one standby system provides failover protection
for multiple active systems. This configuration provides reasonable
utilization of resources while minimizing cost. If multiple failures
should occur, users still may experience some increase in response time.
Alternately, other active servers could be configured to take over.
As previously mentioned, LifeKeeper offers failover protection for
a variety of system components, services and applications. More
information and documentation is available for each of the application
recovery kits on the Steeleye Web site.
</p><p>
The first test scenario was a pair of servers running Linux, Apache,
MySQL and PHP, serving up several Web applications. The hardware
configuration I used was a cluster of two servers with dual network cards.
I connected one NIC (eth0) on each server to the LAN; the second NICs
(eth1) were connected to each other using a crossover cable. I connected the serial
ports (ttyS0) with a null modem cable. I installed and tested
the operating system, applications and supporting software before
installing LifeKeeper. This is the recommended procedure, although
the software could be installed after LifeKeeper.
</p><p>
During my first pass
at installing LifeKeeper, I was running a custom kernel. Consequently,
the Data Replication and NFS Recovery Kits were not installed. However,
the installation guide provides instructions for patching your kernel and
modules as needed. Later, I rebuilt the system and used a default kernel.
No glitches occurred while running the installation support setup, installing
the core applications and recovery kits. I used the LifeKeeper GUI
to set up the communication paths for the heartbeat and to
protect the Web application. Command-line procedures are available as well.
The manual has step-by-step instructions for each phase of the setup and
configuration, but the process is fairly intuitive. I tried several other
configurations, including shared storage and legacy systems.
</p><p>
Once the software was installed and configured and I had tested all
of the protected applications to ensure they were working properly,
I ran several failover tests. I used the GUI to failover
manually from one server to another and back again. This is the procedure that
would be used to take a protected system out of service for maintenance.
The other failures I induced included killing and shutting down protected
services, shutting down and removing cables from the network interfaces
and heartbeat communication paths and shutting down and pulling the power
cord from a protected system. Manually taking a system out of service
produced the quickest change over. Failover due to one of
the faults I induced, however, was not as prompt. Failover from the active to
standby system was quick but not immediate. A system administrator
who might be watching the systems closely or a user who happened
to be accessing the application when a fault occurred would notice a
momentary pause in service. Depending on the type of application or
service provided, this may not be a problem. Overall, I found the
performance for failover and restoration of services to be adequate and
consistent across all of my tests.
</p><p>
Having experimented with high-availability, open-source solutions and
having used other commercial packages, I found LifeKeeper for Linux version
4.4.3 to be a good product. It is well documented and the
software is comparatively easy to install and configure.
Application recovery kits are available for most situations. Additionally, a
generic recovery kit and a software development kit are available for those
few cases not covered. The technical support is knowledgeable
and helpful, and the cost is reasonable. Anyone in the market for a high-availability solution definitely should consider this product.
