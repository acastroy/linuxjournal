Upgrade your wireless network from the old, insecure WEP to the new
standard&mdash;and integrate the authentication with your Linux network.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1298580.0x13903a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Are you worried about the security of your 802.11b wireless
local area network (WLAN) because you're using plain-old wired
equivalent privacy (WEP)? If you're still relying on WEP alone,
you <span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> be nervous: venerable and well-known
vulnerabilities in WEP make it simple for eavesdroppers to crack your
WEP keys simply by capturing a few hours' worth of WLAN packets and
brute-forcing the flawed encryption used by WEP.
</p><p>
But there's hope! Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) adds new authentication
mechanisms and improved encryption key generation to 802.11b, and WLAN
products supporting WPA have become readily available. Better still, Linux
tools are available for WPA supplicants (client systems), authenticators
(access points) and servers (RADIUS authentication servers).
</p><p>
In the next couple of columns, I describe WPA and its component
protocols, how they interoperate and how to build a Linux-based WLAN
authentication server using the FreeRADIUS server-software package.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1298580.0x13905b0"></a>
Overview</h2></div></div><p>
So, what's wrong with 802.11b security in the first place? In
a nutshell, 802.11b's WEP protocol has two fatal flaws. First,
cryptographic-implementation flaws make it impossible to achieve
encryption key strength effectively higher than 40 bits, even
if your gear supports higher key lengths. Second, a weakness in WEP's
encryption key derivation implementation makes it possible for an attacker
to derive a WEP-protected network's WEP secret key&mdash;the encryption key
used by all clients on the entire WLAN&mdash;after capturing a sufficient
number of packets.
</p><p>
The pending 802.11i protocol will provide a complete, robust security
framework for WLANs. Even after it's finalized, however, it will be some
time before this protocol is available widely in commercial products
or free software packages.
</p><p>
Enter WPA. WPA adds two crucial components of 802.11i to 802.11b. First,
it adds the 802.1x authentication protocol, which provides flexible and powerful
authentication capabilities. Second, it adds the TKIP protocol, which provides
mechanisms for assigning unique WEP keys to each WLAN client and
then dynamically re-negotiating them, such that WEP's key derivation
vulnerability effectively is mitigated.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8017f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. WPA Topology
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows how the various pieces of a WPA system interact. First,
we have a WLAN-enabled client system, whose WPA client software is called
a supplicant. The client/supplicant connects to a wireless access
point (AP), which serves as an authenticator, effectively proxying
authentication between the supplicant and a back-end authentication
server. In Figure 1, this back-end server is portrayed as a RADIUS
server, but TACACS also can be used.
</p><p>
Besides proxying authentication between supplicant and server, the
AP/authenticator also feeds data from the authentication server through
the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to obtain a WEP session
key. It then pushes the key back to the supplicant. The supplicant
periodically is prompted to re-authenticate itself, at which time its
WEP key is replaced by a new one.
</p><p>
The authentication (RADIUS) server is optional. Another option is to use
pre-shared key (PSK) mode, in which shared keys unique to each
WPA supplicant system manually are entered into the AP and used for
authentication in lieu of RADIUS. This is better than WEP by itself,
because this shared key is not used as an encryption key itself. Rather,
it is used to seed TKIP transactions, which in turn provide
dynamic WEP keys.
</p><p>
WPA already is supported by a wide variety of new commercial
WLAN adapters and access points. It's even been back-ported to some
older 802.11b products, thanks to firmware upgrades. In the
Linux world, it's supported on the client side by wpa_supplicant
(<a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant" target="_self">hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant</a>), on Linux
access points by hostapd (<a href="http://hostap.epitest.fi/hostapd" target="_self">hostap.epitest.fi/hostapd</a>) and on the authentication server
side by FreeRADIUS
(<a href="http://www.freeradius.org" target="_self">www.freeradius.org</a>).
</p><p>
Before we narrow our focus to building a WPA-ready FreeRADIUS server,
which mainly will be covered in my next column, let's look more closely at the
authentication and encryption portions of WPA.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1298580.0x1390be0"></a>
WPA Authentication: 802.1x, EAP and RADIUS</h2></div></div><p>
Are you following me? Because WPA actually is a bit more complicated
than Figure 1 implies. To review: in WPA, your client system (supplicant)
must authenticate itself to the network before being allowed to connect,
at which point it's provided with a session encryption key that changes
periodically.
</p><p>
The reason this gets complicated is the 802.1x protocol used
for WPA authentication allows for a variety of methods to authenticate
supplicants, which is a good thing. By using a modular,
extensible authentication mechanism, the odds are reduced that WPA&mdash;or
802.1x or 802.11i&mdash;will be made obsolete as particular authentication
protocols go in and out of favor. 802.1x's modularity and extensibility is
provided, appropriately enough, by the Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP), of which a number of variants exist. Let's talk about a few
of the most popular ones.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1298580.0x1390d40"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
So Many Protocols!</b></p><p>
One of the reasons I'm devoting an entire column to describing how WPA
works, rather than simply diving into how to configure FreeRADIUS for WPA,
is the myriad protocols and sub-protocols that comprise WPA can
be confusing. If you're having trouble keeping all this straight,
maybe Figure 2 can help; it shows WPA's protocols in hierarchical form.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8017f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. WPA Protocols
</p></div></div></div><p>
EAP-MD5 uses a simple MD5-hash-based
credentials exchange. The supplicant provides
a username and MD5-hashed password to the server,
and the server compares these to its own
database. Unfortunately, an eavesdropper can capture the
hash transmitted by a WPA supplicant
and run an off-line dictionary attack against the
hash to deduce the password used to create it. Also,
although EAP-MD5 authenticates the supplicant to the
server, it doesn't do anything to authenticate the
server to the user, for example, with server certificates,
&agrave; la SSL. EAP-MD5 therefore is a poor choice for
802.1x authentication in WPA contexts.
</p><p>
EAP-TLS uses the TLS encryption protocol, a descendant of SSL,
as a basis for authentication. On the one hand, this is a strong
authentication method: it requires both the authentication server
and its users to have digital certificates, which are the basis of
authentication transactions. Issuing digital certificates to
a large number of users and managing those certificates, however, can be
complex and time consuming. Consider, for example, the time required to
revoke certificates of people who leave your organization. Also, EAP-TLS
generally requires a complete public key infrastructure (PKI) environment,
which few small-to-medium organizations are comfortable supporting. Also,
when authentication is initiated, user names are transmitted in clear text,
a small but noteworthy exposure.
</p><p>
PEAP (Protected EAP) was developed primarily by Microsoft as a
means of using TLS encryption to protect weaker but simpler authentication
methods, such as MD5 and MS-CHAP. With PEAP, an encrypted channel is
established between supplicants and the server before any credentials are
exchanged. This is consistent with the way most Web applications
use TLS. That is, they use TLS to establish an encrypted tunnel over which simple
user name-password authentications safely can be performed, without
going so far as to use TLS's more secure but more complicated
client-certificate authentication mechanism. The main disadvantage of
PEAP is its Microsoft-centricity. Although some free software tools do
support PEAP, many people see no incentive for Microsoft to ensure
interoperability with other vendors' WPA products or platforms.
</p><p>
EAP-TTLS is, essentially, a non-Microsoft-driven alternative to
PEAP. It involves establishing an encrypted TLS tunnel over which
either TLS-based or other (weaker) forms of authentication are conducted.
Its main advantage over PEAP is being less subject to the whims of one
large corporation. It also presently supports a slightly wider range of
authentication methods, although PEAP is designed to support more methods
than have been implemented thus far. Lacking Microsoft's muscle, some
people see EAP-TTLS as not having as much momentum as PEAP.
</p><p>
Other EAP variants include EAP-SIM, Microsoft's EAP-MSCHAPv2 and Cisco's
Lightweight EAP (LEAP).
</p><p>
At this point, you might be wondering, &ldquo;Hey, isn't RADIUS an
authentication protocol too? How does that fit in?&rdquo; RADIUS is the
protocol your authenticator (AP) speaks to your authentication server. In
the context of 802.1x and WPA, you can think of RADIUS as the transport
over which your authenticator forwards EAP messages to your server. Put
another way, your end-user's supplicant speaks EAP to your authenticator;
your authenticator forwards those messages within RADIUS packets sent
to your server.
</p><p>
There's still <span   class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> protocol at play here, playing a similar
role in supplicant-authenticator communications: EAPOL, or EAP Over
LANs. This protocol is completely transparent, however, because it's
built in to supplicant and authenticator software and requires no
configuration of its own. Therefore, there's nothing specific you need
to know or understand about EAPOL unless you write WPA software.
</p><p>
From the time a supplicant initiates its connection attempt
to the AP, your AP allows <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> EAP traffic. Only after
authentication has completed successfully, based on the server's
response, is your supplicant system given a DHCP lease and permitted to
connect completely to the WLAN. Another consequence of successful authentication,
however, is the assigning of a WEP key to the supplicant.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1298580.0x1391478"></a>
TKIP and WEP Keying</h2></div></div><p>
If a supplicant is authenticated by way of EAP-TLS or some other encrypted
version of EAP, that authentication traffic also is encrypted. But
the wireless LAN frames themselves are not; that can't happen until
WEP is enabled on the connection between the supplicant system and the
access point. As it happens, from the implementor's standpoint, this is the simplest
part of WPA. Upon successful authentication, the server, authenticator
and supplicant use the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to
negotiate and transmit WEP keys securely for use between the authenticator
and the supplicant system. This process largely is transparent: you do
not need to configure anything on the server or supplicant for this to
work. However, most access points, including hostapd on Linux, can be
configured with custom settings for things such as WEP-re-keying interval.
</p><p>
The other thing to remember about TKIP is, as I mentioned earlier,
the server is optional. If you've configured your supplicants and
authenticator to use pre-shared key (PSK) mode, TKIP still is used
to key and re-key WEP encryption dynamically between your supplicant
and access point.

Conclusion (for Now)</h2></div></div><p>
That's WPA in a nutshell. Next time, we'll apply these concepts of using
FreeRADIUS to create a Linux-based authentication server for WPA. If you
