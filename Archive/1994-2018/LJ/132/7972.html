Forced to use proprietary file formats? Let open source ease the
burden.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d98348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Let's begin with a story. Here's what happened:
my second book, coauthored with Dr Michael
Moorhouse, finally was finished. I had spent an
extra six months on it, which meant it now was at
least six months late. I had spent every spare
minute typesetting, proofreading, writing, manually
converting Michael's Microsoft Word files to LaTeX,
reading and then re-reading. Then, I'd proofread it all
again. When it was done and dusted, I was jaded. Soon after, I received
the final proof of the cover. And there it was&mdash;printed right
on the back cover&mdash;a promise to provide Microsoft PowerPoint slides
on the Web site for use with the text. It was too
late to change the cover, which meant I was committed
to providing the slides one way or another. I had
forgotten that we had decided to do this
at the start of the project, more than 18 months prior.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d98450"></a>
The PowerPoint &ldquo;Standard&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>
Eighteen months ago, PowerPoint was the de facto
standard slide production technology within
the academic community. Today, PDF is popular too. As with many in the Linux community, I already had
made the move to OpenOffice.org, leaving PowerPoint
behind. With 20 chapters in the book, I estimated
it would take at least 20 days' effort to produce
the slides manually. The thought of doing this work
with PowerPoint was not something I relished. I could
work within OpenOffice.org Impress, of course, and
then export to PowerPoint when finished, but this idea
didn't sit well with me, either. The basic problem
was I knew all the content already was in the
LaTeX files and having to reproduce it using a slide
production application left me feeling even more drained
than I already was. If only I could find a way to
extract the content programmatically from my LaTeX
files and populate PowerPoint slides with it&mdash;that
would improve things considerably.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d985b0"></a>
Working with Presentation File Formats</h2></div></div><p>
Searching Google resulted in frustration. Perhaps not
surprisingly, details of the PowerPoint file format
were hard to come by. I did find a file in Microsoft
Windows Help format that described the XML standard
for Microsoft Office documents, to which PowerPoint
documents can be exported. Unfortunately, it was
a large, complicated piece of writing.
Having decided I wasn't going to get anywhere on
Google, I surfed over to Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Perl, my programming
language of choice, has been hooked
up to all types of file formats and other computing forms. If anyone had played
with Perl and PowerPoint, details of the work would
be available on CPAN. Unfortunately, this search also drew a blank.
</p><p>
Then it occurred to me: if I could work with the open and widely published
OpenOffice.org Impress document format, I then could export my Impress
slides to PowerPoint as a last step. A quick perusal of the OpenOffice.org
Web site uncovered the official XML description of the OpenOffice.org file
formats. Weighing in at more than 600 pages, the standard is bigger than my
book!
</p><p>
The XML document is well written, but it's pretty heavy going. I
surfed back to CPAN to see if any other programmers had taken the time to
work with OpenOffice.org formats and were gracious enough to
upload their work to CPAN. This time I wasn't disappointed. Jean-Marie
Gouarne of Genicorp recently had released the OpenOffice::OODoc
module, a Perl interface to the OpenOffice.org formats.
Given an existing
document, OpenOffice::OODoc can manipulate the content, adding to,
deleting from and updating the disk file as need be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d98768"></a>
The Slide-Producing Strategy</h2></div></div><p>
I started with a simple filter, written in Perl, that takes
a LaTeX file as input and produces the slide content as output in a
customized textual form. By producing a text file, I ensured that any
text editor could be used to edit the output from the filter, fine-tuning
the textual content as necessary. Once happy with the textual content,
another filter, also written in Perl, uses the textual content
to create an Impress presentation. The Impress presentation then can be
opened in Impress and exported to PowerPoint and/or PDF format.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d98870"></a>
Slide Design</h2></div></div><p>
I made a conscious effort to keep my presentations as simple as possible
and decided to have only three slide types. The title_slide
would contain the title of the chapter at the start of the presentation
file. Within the presentation, the title_slide would do double duty as
a placeholder for any graphic images associated with the chapter, with
one title_slide created per graphic image. The bullet_slide
would contain section titles as its slide heading and subsection titles
as bullet items. Finally, the sourcecode_slide would provide a
mono-spaced, verbatim slide used for program listings.
</p><p>
I used Impress to create a three-slide presentation manually, which I called blank.sxi. Each
of the created slides corresponded to each of the
three slide types described in the last paragraph. I
planned to clone this presentation every time I
programmatically created a presentation for each
of my chapters. By cloning, I'd ensure that all of
the presentations conformed to a standardized look
and feel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d989d0"></a>
The Filter for Extracting Textual Content</h2></div></div><p>
The getcontent script is the type of script that Perl programmers
typically create, use and then throw away. (See the on-line Resources
for downloading the files referred to in this article.) It loops on
standard input, reading one line at a time, and attempts to pattern-match on
content of interest. If a match occurs, appropriate output is produced. As
an example of what getcontent does, here's the code for dealing
with the chapter title from the LaTeX file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if ( /\\chapter\{(.*)\}/ )
{
    print "CHAPTERTITLE: $1\n";
    next;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
A simple regular expression attempts to match on the LaTeX chapter
macro; if a match is found, the chapter title is extracted and output is
generated. The call to next short-circuits the loop, allowing the
next line to be read in from standard input when a match is found. In
this way, the following LaTeX snippet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
\chapter{Working with Regular Expressions}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d98be0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is transformed into this textual content:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CHAPTERTITLE: Working with Regular Expressions
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d98d40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That is, the LaTeX markup is removed and replaced with a much simpler
markup. The section and subsection LaTeX macros were treated in a similar
way. Here's the code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if ( /\\section\{(.*)\}/ )
{
    print "BULLETTITLE: $1\n";
    next;
}

if ( /\\subsection\{(.*)\}/ )
{
    print "BULLETCONTENT: $1\n";
    next;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Working with source code listings is only slightly more complex, due to
the requirement to spot when a chunk of verbatim text has been entered and
exited. Here's the code that handles entry into a LaTeX verbatim block:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if ( /\\begin\{verbatim\}/ )
{
    print "STARTCODE\n";
    $in_verbatim = TRUE;
    next;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
And, here's the code used to handle the exit from a verbatim block:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if ( $in_verbatim )
{
    if ( /\\end\{verbatim\}/ )
    {
        print "STOPCODE\n";
        $in_verbatim = FALSE;
    }
    else
    {
        print;
    }
    next;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
A simple boolean, the $in_verbatim scalar, helps to
determine whether the script currently is working within a
verbatim block. Similar code extracts the maxims that appear throughout
the book's chapters, and a few if blocks handle the graphics,
their captions and other content of interest. For example, consider the following chunk
of LaTeX markup:

<pre     class="programlisting">

\chapter{The Basics}

\textit{Getting started with Perl.}

\section{Let's Get Started!}

There is no substitute for practical experience when first
learning how to program. So, here is the first Perl program
\index{welcome@\texttt{welcome}, and the first program, called
\texttt{welcome}:

\begin{verbatim}
    print "Welcome to the World of Perl!\n";
\end{verbatim}

\noindent When executed by \texttt{perl}
\footnote{We will learn how to do this is in
just a moment.}, this small program displays
the following, perhaps rather not unexpected,
message on screen:

\begin{verbatim}
    Welcome to the World of Perl!
\end{verbatim}

</pre>
</p><p>
The getcontent script transforms the above LaTeX into this textual
content:

<pre     class="programlisting">

CHAPTERTITLE: The Basics
CHAPTERCONTENT: Getting started with Perl.
BULLETTITLE: Let's Get Started!
STARTCODE
    print "Welcome to the World of Perl!\n";
STOPCODE
STARTCODE
    Welcome to the World of Perl!
STOPCODE

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d99160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Notice how all of the LaTeX markup is gone, replaced by a simpler markup
language that will be used to produce slides programmatically. Assuming the LaTeX
chunk was in a file called chapter3.tex, the getcontent
script is executed as follows, piping the result of the transformations
into an appropriately named file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl getcontent chapter3.tex &gt; chapter3.input
</pre>
</p><p>
The chapter3.input file now contains the textual content, and it
can be fine-tuned with any text editor prior to producing the slides.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d99318"></a>
The Impress Presentation Creation Filter</h2></div></div><p>
Producing the slides within an Impress document was complicated
by a number of factors. For starters, the OpenOffice::OODoc
module cannot be used to create a new OpenOffice.org file; it can
manipulate existing files only. Additionally, the module was created with
a view to working primarily with OpenOffice.org Writer files&mdash;word
processor documents&mdash;not Impress presentations. By way of example,
here's a short program, called appendpara, that adds some text to
an already existing Writer document:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

use OpenOffice::OODoc;

my $document = ooDocument( file =&gt; 'blank.sxw' );

$document-&gt;appendParagraph
(
    text    =&gt; 'Some new text',
    style   =&gt; 'Text body'
);

$document-&gt;save;
</pre>
</p><p>
This small program uses the OpenOffice::OODoc module and creates
a document object from the existing Writer file. The program then invokes
the appendParagraph method to add some text before invoking the
save method to commit the changed document to disk.
</p><p>
In addition to the appendParagraph method, the
OpenOffice::OODoc module provides the insertElement method,
which allows a new page of a specified type to be added to a document. The
page can be a clone of an existing page or it can be actual, raw XML.
</p><p>
After reading as far as page 6 of the 600+ page OpenOffice.org XML
file format document, I discovered that Impress used the //draw:page
XML type to represent a slide within a presentation. Unfortunately, the
OpenOffice::OODoc module could not work directly with objects of
this type, so I had to come up with some other mechanism to manipulate the
data. Specifically, I wanted to take the blank template slides contained
in the blank.sxi document and clone each slide as I needed it,
populating the slide's content with the textual content produced by
the getcontent script. To do so, I needed to learn more about the
Impress XML format.
</p><p>
I had two choices: continue to read the 600+ page standard document or
take a look at an actual file to see if I could learn enough to get the
job done. I chose the latter. Recalling from a previous
<i  >Linux Journal</i> article that OpenOffice.org compacts
its multipart file using the popular ZIP algorithm, I created a temporary directory and
unzipped the blank.sxi file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir unzipped
cd unzipped
unzip ../blank.sxi
</pre>
</p><p>
This produced a bunch of files and directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
content.xml
META-INF
meta.xml
mimetype
settings.xml
styles.xml
</pre>
</p><p>
Of most interest is the content.xml file, which contains the
actual content that makes up the document. Viewing this onscreen or
within an editor produced a mass of hard-to-decipher XML. In order
to keep the parts as small as possible, no attention had been paid to
formatting the XML, in any of the parts of the zipped container, in any
meaningful way. Typically, the XML is dumped/stored as a non-indented,
non-whitespace text stream. To try to make sense of it, I needed to be
able to print the XML in a legible manner. In what I can describe only as a moment
of temporary inspiration, I dropped into a command-line and typed
<tt  >xml</tt>
followed by two tabs. A listing of pre-installed tools that start with
the letters xml appeared on screen:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xml2-config     xml-config      xmllint
xmlto           xml2man         xml-i18n-toolize
xmlproc_parse   xmlwf           xml2pot
xmlif           xmlproc_val     xmlcatalog
xmlizer         xmltex
</pre>
</p><p>
The xmllint tool immediately caught my eye. Reading its man page
uncovered the --format option, which&mdash;yes, you guessed
it&mdash;pretty-prints XML provided to the tool. Therefore, typing
<tt  >xmllint --format content.xml</tt> resulted in output
I could pipe to less and actually read without losing my sanity. Here's
an abridged snippet of the pretty-printed content.xml showing the XML
for the title_slide from the blank.sxi Impress document:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;draw:page draw:name="page1" draw:style- ...
  &lt;draw:text-box presentation:style-name= ...
    &lt;text:p text:style-name="P1"&gt;
      &lt;text:span text:style-name="T1"&gt;
        ChapterTitleSlide
      &lt;/text:span&gt;
    &lt;/text:p&gt;
  &lt;/draw:text-box&gt;
  &lt;draw:text-box presentation:style-name= ...
    &lt;text:p text:style-name="P3"&gt;
      &lt;text:span text:style-name="T2"&gt;
        ChapterTitleSlideText
      &lt;/text:span&gt;
    &lt;/text:p&gt;
  &lt;/draw:text-box&gt;
  &lt;presentation:notes&gt;
    &lt;draw:page-thumbnail draw:style-name= ...
    &lt;draw:text-box presentation:style-name ...
  &lt;/presentation:notes&gt;
&lt;/draw:page&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the ChapterTitleSlide and ChapterTitleSlideText content, which
I had typed into blank.sxi when creating it with Impress. If I
could use the insertElement method to add raw XML based on this
extract, with the empty content replaced with my textual content, I'd
be home free.
</p><p>
By way of example, consider what happens once
the title of the presentation and its subtitle
are processed by produce_slides. The
insertElement method is invoked as follows,
creating a new slide:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$presentation-&gt;insertElement( '//draw:page',
  $last_slide++,
    title_slide( $title_title, $title_content ),
      position =&gt; 'after' );
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d99a50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The title_slide subroutine returns raw XML, which is inserted into
the document.
</p><p>
Given an input file conforming to the textual content produced
by getcontent, the produce_slides script clones the
blank.sxi Impress file and populates any number of slides,
programmatically producing a presentation. The script is not unlike
getcontent in structure, its only warts being the verbatim
inclusion of the required XML for each of the three slide types
contained within blank.sxi. To create a presentation, invoke
produce_slides as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl produce_slides 3 chapter3.input
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d99c08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This results in a new Impress document called chapter3.sxi appearing
on disk.
</p><p>
With the Impress files created, I needed to replace my
graphic image placeholders with the actual image. The
getcontent script extracted the image filename, however,
not the actual image. Importing the images into
Impress should have been straightforward, except that
the originals I had were of pretty poor quality compared to
those that made it into the book. The final images had been improved
greatly during the publisher's final typesetting phase. And, of
course, I didn't have the final image files.
</p><p>
Then I remembered that the publisher had sent final
proof PDFs with all the high-quality graphic images
in place. I used xpdf to view the proofs at
200% and then fired up The GIMP to screen-capture
the xpdf display window. I then cut out the
graphic image and saved it as a JPEG. It took a
little while, but when finished I had a beautiful
set of book-quality images to import into my Impress
presentations. With this task complete, I exported
the Impress document to PowerPoint format and the job
was done. My initial estimate of 20 days of effort
was reduced to about 20 hours of real work.
</p><p>
And now, of course, if I need to produce some slides quickly, I can
create my textual content manually in vi, run it through the
produce_slides script and I'm done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ca0580.0x1d906a8"></a>
Final Words</h2></div></div><p>
What started off as a seemingly impossible task&mdash;programmatically
producing PowerPoint presentations&mdash;turned out to be quite possible,
thanks to open source. All the tools I needed shipped out of the box
with my stock Red Hat 9 distribution: vi, unzip, Perl, xmllint, xpdf, The GIMP and
the OpenOffice.org suite.
