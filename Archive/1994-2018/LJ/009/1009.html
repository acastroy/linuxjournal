space reserved for this column to include more interesting and
useful articles, but it is time to give you an update on what is
happening at <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
</p><p>Despite several setbacks, including my computer dying, <i  >LJ</i> has
improved over the past few months, as we are told over and over
again in letters to the editor. However, we see much more room for
improvement&mdash;and the more subscribers we have, the faster we are
able to improve. Our thanks to all our subscribers!</p><p>Our greatest improvements will come from our readers. There
is only so much that we can write; you, our readers, use Linux for
things that we haven't thought of yet. In this issue, for instance,
you'll read how Vance Petree at Virgina Power has implemented a
system for managing large amounts of data using Linux systems (see
page 23). In our September issue, Greg Wettstein wrote about using
Linux to manage patient care for a large cancer research center. It
is our policy to print at least one article each month about how
Linux is being used in the real world, but we are dependent on you,
our readers, to keep us informed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1173580.0x126b558"></a>What We've Been Up To</h2></div></div><p>We have hired several new staff members to process all our
new subscription orders and to spend more time editing the
articles. We have designed short monthly features with useful
information, including ftp sites where information about Linux is
available. Over the last few issues, we have instituted a policy of
including a guide to available applicable resources of all types
(including Internet sites, WWW URLs, and books) with most articles.
We are now in the process of publishing a book called The Linux
Sampler, filled with a mix of articles from <i  >Linux Journal</i>, with
sections on Linux history, systems administration, resources, and
real world applications.</p><p>We exhibited at Unix Expo, as was covered in last month's
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, and helped make technical contacts between Linux
developers and hardware and software vendors interested in Linux.
We sponsored a two-day Linux Conference at Open Systems World in
December, which included several short classes on a variety of
topics and one full-day tutorial introduction to Linux.</p><p>Also, we like having fun with Linux just as much as the rest
of you do. Many of you have seen our &ldquo;My Other Computer Is a Linux
System&rdquo; stickers and t-shirts; we are now offering a Linux
bumpersticker, and we sell other Linux-related products through our
catalog. If you have other ideas for fun Linux-related items, feel
free to send them to info@linuxjournal.com.</p></div></div>
