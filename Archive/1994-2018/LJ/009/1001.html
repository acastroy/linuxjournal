    Want a faster connection to the Internet? In this article,
    you'll learn how to get your Linux box connected.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c864a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ever wonder what it would be like to have
your Linux box connected to the backbone of the Internet? Well,
maybe not the backbone&mdash;but how about a direct connection to one of
the many Internet service providers? Lightning-fast response time.
You could set up your very own ftp site, or perhaps a gopher or
World Wide Web server. Wouldn't it be nice to have Mosaic draw
heavily graphical World Wide Web pages in seconds instead of
minutes at 14.4 kbps?
</p><p>What does all this cost? You'd better sit down first. Comfy?
Good. Assuming you already have a Linux box, startup costs are in
the range of $3,000-$5,000. Monthly costs range anywhere from
$500-$1,000. This generally places such a connection out of reach
for most people.</p><p>However, there is currently a rapidly-expanding market for
small Internet service providers, who need a faster connection to
the Internet than 14.4 kbps to be competitive&mdash;and some of whom are
using Linux. There are also more and more businesses becoming
interested in having a presence on the Internet, and many are using
Linux boxes to provide this.</p><p>In this article, I'll take you on a tour of what's required
to get a direct connection to the Internet. First, I'll touch on
the various software packages you'll need to understand how to
manage an Internet-connected machine. Next, I'll introduce the
concepts behind a direct Internet connection; I'll describe the
hardware required and the different configurations available.
Finally, I'll discuss how to select an Internet service
provider.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c866b8"></a>Get Some Experience First</h2></div></div><p>You've got a lot to learn. No, seriously. And, with the cost
of a direct Internet connection, the last place you want to learn
this stuff is online. If you have the time to do it right, I'd
suggest connecting in several stages, learning in pieces as you go
along.</p><p>Let's assume you are fairly skilled at managing a Linux box.
This is a skill you can learn even if your machine has no
connections to the outside world. In fact, having no connections
makes learning easier; it will allow you to focus on the tasks
needed to maintain a Linux box. Once you are comfortable doing
this, take one small step towards the Internet: Obtain a UUCP
connection to your machine.</p><p>A UUCP connection is a good way to get your feet wet
connecting to the outside world&mdash;it will teach you how to manage a
news and mail feed. Most of the Linux distributions come with all
the news and mail tools you'll need. The Mail-HOWTO guide and the
News-HOWTO guide will help you configure things correctly. News and
mail are the two most common services on both directly connected
and indirectly connected Internet machines. These are important
services that people using your machine will expect to work. Spend
the time to learn how each package works. Make sure you understand
how news and mail are configured. Learn what log files are produced
and where they are located. When you connect your machine to the
Internet, it is inevitable that you will encounter problems with
news and mail. You can save yourself a lot of time and trouble by
learning how these work now, rather than later.</p><p>The next step above a UUCP connection is a dial-up IP
connection. Dial-up IP places your machine on the Internet like a
dedicated connection, whenever you dial in. This will give you some
experience running TCP/IP. You can also try running your very own
ftp site, a gopher server, or even an HTTP server for WWW clients.
If you expect to be running any of these services when you get your
dedicated connection, start experimenting with them now. Learn how
to configure them. Learn what log files are produced and where to
find them. Check out the comp.info-systems.www newsgroup.</p><p>Security becomes a very important issue once you place your
machine on the Internet. Any data residing on an Internet-connected
machine can potentially be read by anyone on the Internet, unless
your security prevents it. Now, even if you think you don't have
anything on your machine that you don't mind others reading, don't
think you can just brush security concerns aside. There are many
documented bugs in Unix packages that allow hackers to gain access
to an existing account, or even root access.</p><p>To get up to speed on security, start by reading the
comp.security .unix newsgroup. It has an excellent FAQ on what to
watch out for. Also check the newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce. You
will find Linux-specific security holes posted here. The best
method to determine just how secure your machine is, is to have
someone try and break in. If you know someone who is very
knowledgeable about Unix, that person would be an excellent
candidate for the job. If you don't know or trust someone enough to
do this, just get a few average computer people to try to break in.
You'd be surprised at how many holes even the average user can
discover.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86978"></a>What Type of Dedicated Connection Should I
Get?</h2></div></div><p>At this point, if you have followed my advice, you've managed
a UUCP news and mail feed. You've worked with dial-up IP. Maybe
you've even tried running a gopher, ftp, or HTTP server. And, you
have learned a lot about Unix security. If you haven't, do it
now!</p><p>A dedicated connection means your machine is connected to the
Internet 24 hours a day. This speeds up services like news and
mail. Mail between two Internet-connected machines happens
literally in seconds. The frequency of Usenet news updates is
controlled by each site. Hourly&mdash;or even more frequent&mdash;news
updates are commonplace. You also get some services that are only
available to Internet connected machines such as telnet, ftp,
gopher, and World Wide Web.</p><p>In order to put your machine on the Internet, you will need a
dedicated line between you and your service provider. A dedicated
line is a telephone line that is open 24 hours a day. What do I
mean by open 24 hours a day? Say you call a friend and talk for a
few minutes. Then, you walk away from the phone for a while. When
you have something else to tell your friend, you pick up the phone
and tell him. You don't have to dial his number again because
you've never hung up. This service is billed at a fixed, monthly
rate; there is no charge for usage. The phone company connects the
dedicated line to the destination phone number. Only the phone
company may change the destination.</p><p>You will have to decide how fast a connection you will need.
The minimum speed is 56 kbps, which is perfect for a small
business. If you plan on transferring audio in real-time, you will
need a 1.54 Mbps line, commonly known as a T1 line. If you plan to
transfer video in real-time, you'll need a T3 line which transfers
data at the rate of 45 Mbps. Watch out for bottlenecks&mdash;buying a T1
line in the hopes of talking with a remote site across the country
at T1 speeds is pointless if any of the other lines the data will
pass through are running at 56 kbps.</p><p>Dedicated lines come in several different flavours. Analog
lines can handle speeds up to 28.8 kbps. This is the same grade as
your typical home phone line. You probably don't want one of these.
Digital lines handle speeds of 56 kbps right up to T3 (45 Mbps)
speeds. The cost of a digital line depends on the distance between
you and your service provider. An alternative to digital dedicated
lines is frame relay. Frame relay is the new technology on the
block. Frame relay charges are based on speed, not distance; this
may offer significant savings over a digital line. Not all service
providers support frame relay. Check with your service provider.
For the purposes of this article, I will assume you are going to go
with a digital line at 56 kbps. This is the most common Internet
connection.</p><p>With a dedicated connection, your Linux box is available 24
hours a day to access the Internet. But beware, the reverse is also
true. The Internet can access your Linux box 24 hours a day. Keep
your machine secure or you could suffer a lot of damage from system
crackers. In order to prevent this, consider reading Cheswick and
Bellovin's Firewalls and Internet Security, reviewed in issue 6 of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86c90"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1001f1.jpg"></div><p>Before I describe a 56 kbps connection, let's review a
connection with which you are probably more familiar: a regular
14.4 kbps modem connection. (See Figure 1 above.) A 14.4 kbps
connection will require a serial port in each machine, a modem at
each machine and, of course, a telephone line. The two modems
communicate at 14.4 kbps using the v.32bis protocol. The serial
connection between each modem and the Linux box can be set at 19.2,
38.4, or 57.8 kbps; data compression is the reason the serial
connection runs faster than the modem. The modem connection is 14.4
kbps compressed with the v.42bis compression protocol; the serial
connection is uncompressed. In order for the serial line to keep up
with the modem connection, it must pass more bits per second than
the modem. Now that you know where all the protocols fit into the
picture in a 14.4 kbps connection, let's tackle a 56 kbps
connection.</p><p>Take a look at Figure 2 (opposite). A 56 kbps connection may
be too fast for your serial port, so Ethernet offers an
alternative. Ethernet signals cannot be transferred over the
telephone lines, so you must use a protocol specifically designed
for telephone lines, v.35. What you end up with is Ethernet coming
out of the Linux box, being converted to v.35 signals, and being
transferred over the telephone lines to your Internet service
provider. You need to install an Ethernet card in your Linux box
and configure the kernel to support TCP/IP&mdash;see the NET-2-HOWTO
document for the details. To convert Ethernet signals to v.35
signals you will need a router. Finally, to send the v.35 signals
over the phone lines, you will need a 56 kbps CSU/DSU (also known
as a digital modem).</p><p>The router with CSU/DSU is the most common configuration for
dedicated connections to the Internet. Vendors are now selling
hardware which combines the router and CSU/DSU into one box. The
single box is cheaper, but not as flexible in case of future
growth. For example, if you want to change from a 56 kbps to a 128
kbps line, you can use the same router with a 128 bkps CSU/DSU. If
you go with the single box, you'll have to replace the entire unit.
Take into account your plans for the future and pick the option
that suits them.</p><p>It will soon also be possible to buy a v.35 CSU/DSU card that
plugs directly into your Linux box. That is, it is possible to buy
the card now, but the driver is still being developed as this is
written. When the driver is available, this option will cost less
than an Ethernet card, router, and external CSU/DSU, be a little
less flexible, require that the Linux box it is attached to act as
a router, and be ideal for many situations where the Linux box is
being used as a firewall. On the other hand, it is a poor solution
for sites with more than a few dial-in lines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c86fa8"></a>Choosing an Internet Service Provider</h2></div></div><p>The Internet service provider business is booming right now.
New companies come online each month. Service providers come in all
sizes&mdash;from large, cross-country providers serving an entire
country, to medium-sized, regional providers serving several nearby
cities, to small providers serving only a single city.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1001f2.jpg"></div><p>Finding the larger providers and most medium-sized ones is
easy. There are several lists of service providers available; here
are a couple I have found useful:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>DLIST: A list of Internet service providers that
sell direct connections. Most, if not all, of the large national
providers are listed here. You can get a copy of this list by
sending e-mail with an empty message body to dlist@ora.com. If you
have any problems getting this list, send e-mail to
mj@ora.com.</p></li><li><p>PDIAL: A list of Internet service providers that
offer dial-up accounts. The PDIAL list contains many more providers
than the DLIST. The additional providers tend to be the small to
medium-sized ones. Most of the companies listed will provide
dial-up accounts only; however, if you find a provider close to
you, call or e-mail them and ask if they sell dedicated
connections&mdash;some of them might. To receive the PDIAL list, send
e-mail to info-deli-server@netcom.com with &ldquo;Send PDIAL&rdquo; in the body
of the note.</p></li></ul></div><p>Finding the smaller providers that service only your city can
be a little trickier. Check your city's computer paper. Check local
user groups. Check with local computer stores to see if they know
of anyone providing Internet access in the area. You'd be surprised
how many consulting firms, out-sourcing companies, and even
computer stores are using the unused time on their computer
equipment to provide Internet access.</p><p>Most providers have an e-mail address you can send mail to
for more information; select a few and e-mail them. Describe your
site to them and the type of connection you are looking for. For
example, if you have an office LAN you want to connect to the
Internet, tell them. See what they suggest and how much it will
cost.</p><p>Now, you have to be careful when it comes to costs. Some
providers charge a setup fee. Others require you to sign a six- or
twelve-month agreement with them. Some charge only for the Internet
feed; you must pay the phone company directly for the dedicated
line. Others combine the two charges and you pay the service
provider only. Some require you to purchase a CSU/DSU at their
site. Others include this charge as part of your setup fee. In the
end, you'll have to decide on whether you want the flexibility of a
month-to-month lease, or the extra savings of a long-term
commitment.</p><p>Narrow the possible candidates down to two or three good
prospects. Then, ask for references. The best way to check the
quality of a service provider's service is to talk with at least
three other companies using their service and get their opinions.
Ask how long they have had the connection, what they like most,
what they like least, how often the connection goes down, and how
long it takes to get fixed. Ask for references similar to you in
terms of type of connection, number of users, and type of office
network.</p><p>Maintenance is another issue. Some providers will install the
equipment at your site and maintain the equipment remotely; this is
a good option for small sites with little experience with the
hardware involved. For the more daring, you can install your own
equipment at your site. You might have the odd interruption as you
learn how things work, but if you don't mind this possibility, the
knowledge you gain will be helpful to you later.</p><p>You still need to purchase a dedicated line from your site to
your service provider's site. Some service providers take care of
this for you; others require you to arrange this with the telephone
company. Arranging for a dedicated line is not difficult&mdash;you could
do it yourself. The advantage of having the service provider handle
this is you only have one number to call if something goes wrong
with the connection. If you are dealing with two companies, each
may tell you the problem lies with the other's equipment and will
ask you to contact the other first. If you have ever run into this
vendor-roulette before, you'll know how frustrating it can be.
Neither side wishes to investigate the problem until the other side
has investigated things first.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c875d8"></a>What To Do with Your Connection?</h2></div></div><p>If you have an existing TCP/IP network that you are
connecting to the Internet, you may want to set up your Linux box
as a firewall between your network and the Internet. This is done
to prevent unauthorized users from accessing services you want only
your local users to access. See the comp.security.unix FAQ for more
information about firewalls. If you plan on connecting dial-in
lines to your Linux box, I have some suggestions on the machine
size and configuration. These suggestions may not work for every
situation, but they will give you a starting point from which to
work.</p><p>For a small operation with 1-4 dial-in modems, a 486DX33 with
16MB of RAM and a four port serial card would be a good starter
system. For a medium sized operation with 4-16 dial-in modems, a
486DX33 with 32MB of RAM and a 16 port serial card might be
reasonable configuration to start with. Keep in mind that the CPU
speed and amount of memory needed will ultimately depend on what
your users will be doing on your system. If they only read news and
send e-mail, this might be more than enough. If things start
slowing down, add more memory.</p><p>For a large operation with 16+ dial-in modems, try two
486DX66s with 16MB each. Put a large hard drive on one machine and
NFS mount it on the other machine. With so many modems, you don't
want to overburden your Linux box with serial ports. Instead, you
can get a terminal server which is a piece of hardware that manages
modems. Your modems plug into one end and an Ethernet connection
comes out of the other. Another feature of terminal servers is they
allow you to attach each modem (or port) to a different Linux box.
In this case you have two machines, so assign half to each machine.
If your machines are getting overloaded, you can increase memory as
before, or you can get a third machine and redistribute the ports
accordingly.</p><p>Keep in mind that the above systems are only suggestions;
there are too many variables involved to suggest that any of the
above systems will work in all cases. Your configuration will
ultimately depend on how many people use your machine and what
tasks they normally perform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b8e580.0x1c877e8"></a>Looking Further</h2></div></div><p>If you want more information about connecting to the
Internet, I recommend the following books:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Connecting To the Internet</em></span>,
O'Reilly &amp; Associates, ISBN 1-56592-061-9. Covers all aspects
of connecting and offers a general overview of how data travels
through the Internet, the different types of available hardware,
how to choose an Internet service provider, and the trade-offs of
dial-up IP vs. 56 kbps connections.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Canadian Internet Handbook 1994
Edition</em></span>, Prentice Hall Canada, ISBN 0-13-304395-9. If
you live in Canada, this is an excellent source of information on
how the Internet flows through Canada; includes a list of service
providers by province.</p></li></ul></div><p>Various USENET newsgroups are also an excellent source of
information. Check out the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>comp.security.unix - Unix security issues.</p></li><li><p>comp.unix.admin - Administering Unix boxes in
general.</p></li><li><p>comp.os.linux.announce - Important announcements
about Linux.</p></li><li><p>comp.os.linux.admin - Administering a Linux
box.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you have a security question, ask it first in comp
.security.unix. For the most part, security is the same on all
flavours of Unix&mdash;it is rarely Linux-specific. If your question
happens to be one of those rare cases, there are many
Linux-literate readers of this newsgroup who can help you
out.</p><p>Connecting your machine or network to the Internet is a huge
undertaking. But if you take the time to learn how things work, you
will be able to tackle this task with ease. Good luck on your
connection adventure.</p><p>Russell Ochocki, B.C.Sc. (Hons), is a computer
