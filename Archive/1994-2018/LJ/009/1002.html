    Jens Hartman shows how to use rlogin, rcp, and rsh to transfer and
    manipulate data on different computers from across the network.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ffb500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Normally, being connected to some kind of
network does not mean that you are able to directly access all
resources provided by that network. Some devices, like tape drives
and printers, are connected to special computers and are only
accessible on these machines. Others, such as disk drives, can be
accessed easily, when the system administrators allow it.
</p><p>Gaining direct access to resources becomes more complicated
the larger the network gets. This is partly due to security
reasons, and partly due to the simple fact that the more people
that have to be convinced you need to mount a disk, the less your
chance of success. From this follows the rule that the more
resources available, the harder it will usually be to connect to
them.</p><p>A nice and easy way around this dilemma is using the remote
commands <b  >rlogin</b>, <b  >rcp</b> and
<b  >rsh</b>. These commands allow access to any account
that is owned by you on any computer in the network without the use
of a password. <b  >rcp</b> and <b  >rlogin</b>
can be compared with ftp and telnet, whereas <b  >rsh</b>
offers the possibility to combine commands on different machines in
one shell pipeline.</p><p>Configuration is extremely easy&mdash;in fact, your host network
is probably configured correctly already&mdash;and you have instant
access to these capabilities. In this article, I present these
commands, explain the local setup, give some examples to give you a
start, show some options, and demonstrate the complexity that can
be reached. Most of my examples can easily be replicated on your
networked machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ffb920"></a>Setup:</h2></div></div><p>Under normal conditions (your network is up, you can telnet
into other machines, and you can be reached by other machines), the
only thing you need to do is create a file called
<b  >.rhosts</b> in your home directory which is readable
and writable only by you (mode 600). This file should contain the
full hostnames of each of the machines you want to log in from, and
the user name on that machine, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apple.groucho.edu          fred
orange.groucho.edu              sam
</pre><p>The <b  >.rhosts</b> file specifies the machines
and users that are allowed to login to the user
<span   class="bold"><b>on the machine where the .rhosts file
resides</b></span>. If I am logged in as sam on the machine
banana.groucho.edu and I have the above .rhosts file in my home
directory, then the user sam from orange.groucho.edu and the user
fred from the machine apple.groucho.edu have remote access to my
account.</p><p>Now, I log into apple.groucho.edu (username fred) from my
account on banana.groucho.edu. From apple.groucho.edu I run the
following command: <b  >rlogin banana.groucho.edu -l
sam</b>. Once you are logged in, shell commands will work as
normal.</p><p>If you are asked to enter your password, do not enter a
password, but instead quickly switch back to your original login on
banana.groucho.edu and type <b  >ps -a</b>. In the
process list your rlogin request should appear with the name of the
machine it came from as an argument. When this is different from
the name you entered in the <b  >.rhosts</b> file, you
will need to enter the new name. Sometimes a machine uses different
lines or a common server for such communication, although its name
doesn't change. If there is still no connection, you should ask the
system administrator. Some machines simply don't allow any rlogin
commands.</p><p>In order to respond to any rlogin request, your Linux
machine's <b  >inetd.conf</b> should have the following
two lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
shell   stream  tcp     nowait  root /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.rshd
login   stream  tcp     nowait  root /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.rlogind
</pre><p>When you are a member of a domain and share usernames, you
might want to include the hosts you frequently connect to in
<b  >/etc/hosts.equiv</b>. In this case your
<b  >.rhosts</b> file may contain only the nickname
(which is commonly just the machine name without the domain
information) together with the username. The above example
<b  >.rhosts</b> file on the machine named
banana.groucho.edu would then look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
apple.groucho.edu               fred
orange                          sam
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ffc058"></a>RCP:</h2></div></div><p>The rcp command copies files or directories from one machine
to another. It is used like the cp command. For instance, I can
copy a file named test.dat from the remote machine banana to my
local machine orange. (For this example to work the two machines
must share usernames.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp banana:test.dat .
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp banana.groucho.edu:test.dat .
</pre><p>The file <b  >test.dat</b> is situated in my home
directory on banana and is copied to my current directory on
orange.</p><p>If I want to copy my Mail directory and its contents to
orange into the directory <b  >Mail.banana</b> (again,
from orange):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp -r banana:Mail Mail.banana
</pre><p>To preserve the time stamp I would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp -r -p banana:Mail Mail.banana
</pre><p>Making a remote copy from the machine apple where I have a
different account, apple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp fred@apple:test.dat test
</pre><p>Of course, things also work the other way around. Here is a
remote copy to apple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp test.dat fred@apple:test.dat
</pre><p>The last interesting thing would be a copy from apple to
banana, while you're logged into banana. Unfortunately, this works
on every other machine except my Linux machines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rcp fred@apple:test.dat banana:test.dat
</pre><p>You see that <b  >rcp</b> is a bit handier than
ftp.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rlogin:
</pre><p>With <b  >rlogin</b> you perform a remote login to
another machine. It can be used instead of telnet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rlogin orange
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rlogin -l fred apple
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rlogin  apple -l fred
</pre><p>(for some versions of Unix)</p><p>I integrate every machine in my window-menu with an rlogin.
This makes login very efficient. As an example, here are two
descriptions&mdash;one for windows manager <b  >fvwm</b> and
one for <b  >olvwm</b>--to add a menu and a shortcut key
for <b  >rlogin</b> to orange. The
<b  >xhost</b> can be omitted, but it is useful for other
things. For <b  >fvwm</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Popup "Rlogin"
Title "Rlogin"
Exec "banana F1" xhost +banana;\
exec xterm -fn fixed -T banana -sb -e rlogin banana &amp; EndPopup
Key F1  A N  Exec "banana" xhost +banana;\
exec xterm -fn fixed -T banana -sb -e rlogin banana &amp;
</pre><p>For <b  >olvwm</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"Login" MENU
"Rlogin" TITLE PIN
"banana"  xhost +banana; exec xterm -T banana\
-sb -e rlogin banana
"Login" END
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ff36a8"></a>rsh:</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >rsh</b> command is the most powerful
remote command, as it can be integrated into a pipe. This enables
you to execute complex command sequences between different
machines. Without any command, <b  >rsh</b> rlogins to
the other machine. When I am logged into orange:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana
logs me remotely to banana, while:
rsh -l fred apple
</pre><p>does the same on apple, where the username is different from
the one for my current shell on orange.
</p><p>Both <span   class="bold"><b>stdout</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>stderr</b></span> from the remote machine are
piped to the local machine. After establishing the connection,
neither <b  >/etc/profile</b> nor
<b  >.bash_profile</b> (for bash) nor
<b  >.login</b> (for csh and tcsh) are scanned. This can
be confusing in the beginning, as not everything you defined as
variables and aliases for a login shell are present. This is
different from rlogin, which gives you a real &ldquo;login shell&rdquo;. The
most common problem is that you use a command that cannot be found
because the path variable has not been set correctly. In these
cases, you could set your path in your shell initialization file,
such as <b  >.bashrc</b> or <b  >.cshrc</b>
(there is no such file for <b  >/bin/sh</b>, however). A
more general solution is to simply use fully qualified pathnames
for commands.</p><p>The easiest use of <b  >rsh</b> is a simple command
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana ls
</pre><p>You should get a listing from your home directory on banana.
If you want to use options that start with &ldquo;-&rdquo;, the syntax would
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana `ls -al'
</pre><p>Everything in between the quotes is executed on banana.
</p><p>The listing was sent to your local stdout, your screen, just
as if ls had been executed locally (on orange). Below are some
examples of creating a tar archive on banana from a directory
called bin, with the output going to stdout and the archive file
being placed on orange:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana `tar cf - bin' | dd of=archive.tar
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana `tar cf - bin' &gt; archive.tar
</pre><p>Of course this will work for different usernames or in the other
direction too:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh -l fred apple `tar cf - bin' &gt; archive.tar       tar cf - bin | rsh -l
fred apple dd of=archive.tar
</pre><p>The <b  >dd</b> command is very handy here, because
it copies stdin to the file specified by <b  >of</b>. If
I were to use &gt; to redirect the output, I would end up on orange
again, but I want the file to be written to apple instead, which
<b  >dd</b> does correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ff41a8"></a>rsh Wizardry:</h2></div></div><p>Now for some examples of what happens on which machine. Start
with something simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        ps -aux | grep root
</pre><p>This shows all processes root owns on your local machine. The
next command will show all processes on banana which are owned by
root.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        rsh banana `ps -aux' | grep root
</pre><p>In this case, the <b  >ps</b> command is executed
on banana, but <b  >grep</b> is executed locally (on
orange).</p><p>The next command does the same thing, except that the grep
command is executed on banana, as is the ps command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana `ps -aux | grep root'
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana `ps -aux' | rsh banana `grep root'
</pre><p>The next example shows how to split
<span   class="bold"><b>stderr</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>stdout</b></span> (this works only for sh or
bash, not for csh or tcsh!):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 rsh banana `dd if=bin.tar 2&gt;fehler' &gt; test.dat
</pre><p>Here we have dd that writes its error output to the file
<b  >fehler</b> on banana, but which transmits its
standard output to orange into the file
<b  >test.dat</b>. The secret here is the use of quotes.
Because <b  >2&gt;fehler</b> is inside the quotes it is
executed on banana. Things can get very tricky. Not only can you
make full use of shell commands, you also can run them on different
machines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana `tar xf bin.tar `rsh banana `tar tf \ bin.tar' | grep gj2.c`'
</pre><p>Here I have a tar archive <b  >bin.tar</b> on
banana. In it there is a file called
<b  >usr/local/src/gj2.c</b>. First, there is a command
expansion in between <b  >` ... `</b>. This expansion
returns all the filenames from the archive which contain the string
&ldquo;gj2.c&rdquo;. First, <b  >tar tf</b> returns the list of files
in the archive and then <b  >grep</b> (running on orange)
performs the pattern match. This yields
<b  >usr/local/src/gj2.c</b> and
<b  >usr/local/src/gj2.c~</b>. Now the first tar
(<b  >tar xf bin.tar</b>) extracts these files on
banana.</p><p>Imagine that you have a tape drive attached to banana and
another to orange. You want to make a copy of a tape. Dumping the
contents of the tape to the disk drive and copying it back to
another tape would be a solution, but would require enough free
disk space to hold the entire contents of the tape. Another
solution would look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana dd if=/dev/rst0 ibs=1024 | dd \
of=/dev/rmt0 obs=1024
</pre><p>Here <b  >/dev/rst0</b> is a SCSI tape drive on
banana and <b  >/dev/rmt0</b>a SCSI tape drive on orange.
Now you want to process your data with a special program called
<b  >demux</b>. After processing, your data has shrunk
considerably to about 200 megabytes. As we operate on binary data,
porting our program to banana would be very time consuming (orange
is still my Linux machine). On the other hand, orange doesn't have
200 megabytes of free space. We do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana dd if=/dev/rst0 ibs=1024 | demux | \
rsh banana dd of=file.dat
</pre><p>Now we read from banana, process on orange and write back to
banana.</p><p>In the next illustration you want to access a printer
connected to banana. We have a PostScript file,
<b  >test.ps</b>, that we want to send on a printer
called p_a4:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=test.ps | rsh banana `lpr -Pp_a4'
</pre><p>You might want to have a look at the file before you print
it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=test.ps | rsh banana `xv - -display orange:0'
</pre><p>This will only work under X-windows. On orange, you would
have given a command like <b  >xhost +banana</b>
first.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ff5178"></a>Problems:</h2></div></div><p>Apart from the fact that some of the above examples probably
will not run under some configurations, I have encountered some
strange behavior. Consider we have, as in the previous examples,
two identical files: <b  >bin.tar</b> on banana and
<b  >bin.tar</b> on orange. Now I try on orange:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls | grep bin
</pre><p>The response is <b  >bin.tar</b>. The same goes
for:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rsh banana ls | grep bin
</pre><p>but the next one chokes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls | rsh banana grep bin
</pre><p>Piping files into a remote shell with the command
<b  >dd</b>, though, has never choked.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f03580.0x1ff55f0"></a>Conclusion:</h2></div></div><p>With the help of these commands, getting connected to other
machines is made considerably easier. The <b  >rcp</b>
and <b  >rlogin</b> commands can be almost fully
substituted for commands such as <b  >ftp</b> and
<b  >telnet</b> on your local network. Not only can you
access your accounts, you might also allow other trusted users to
access your accounts by means of the <b  >.rhosts</b>
file.</p><p>Finally, the <b  >rsh</b> command enables you to
generate data streams through several different machines, accessing
local disk and tape drives (or anything else you are allowed to
access).</p></div></div>
