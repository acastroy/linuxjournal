    As I write this in mid-November and look back on 1994, I see
    some amazing
    happenings in the computing field&mdash;and most of the amazement has to do
    with Linux itself.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131d580.0x14153f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Here are a few examples:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Decus invites Linus to speak at their conference in
New Orleans.</p></li><li><p>The Australian Unix Users' Group invites Linus to
speak at their annual meeting.</p></li><li><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> has a booth at
Unix Expo and gives out 3,000 copies of the magazine.</p></li><li><p>PC Week names Linux as software Product of the
Week.</p></li><li><p>Rumors are that HP, IBM, and other big names are
using Linux internally.</p></li><li><p>I went into three mainstream computer stores and
said I was looking for a laptop to run Linux. One store didn't know
what I was talking about. Another suggested a particular system
because it had a larger hard disk which would be good for Linux.
The other told me that the laptop they sold didn't run Linux (they
had tried it), but suggested another brand that did.</p></li><li><p>Companies such as the Roger Maris Cancer Center and
Virginia Power port applications from commercial operating systems
to Linux and explain that they did it because they needed something
&ldquo;better&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Open Systems World, in its sixth year as a
Washington, DC, based trade show decides to have a Linux Conference
right along with the SCO and Solaris conferences.</p></li><li><p>Unix Expo contacts <i  >Linux Journal</i> about doing a Linux section at their New York
show in 1995.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131d580.0x1415c38"></a>Why is this amazing?</h2></div></div><p>Because these aren't &ldquo;Linux events&rdquo;, these are cases of the
&ldquo;real world&rdquo; showing an interest in Linux. At the beginning of the
year, mainstream computing hadn't even heard of Linux. At Uniforum
in March, <i  >Linux Journal</i> had a booth. Although
the booth was very popular, the most common question was &ldquo;What is
Linux?&rdquo; Today people seem more likely to ask &ldquo;Why should I run
Linux?&rdquo;, and then actually listen to the answer.</p><p>Now comes the assignment. If we want people to take us
seriously we need to give good answers. Yes, Linux is a fun
&ldquo;hacker&rdquo; system. But some of these people want to do real work. We
need to listen to their needs and either explain how Linux can meet
those needs or, if it can't, tell everyone who is interested in
development what these people are looking for.</p><p>And this is where <i  >Linux Journal</i> can
help. Let us know what people are asking for and we'll help get the
word out.</p><p>To start off this effort, here is an idea I am working on&mdash;a
Linux-based &ldquo;freenet&rdquo; system. For those of you not familiar with a
freenet, it is a public-access computer system designed to offer
communications within a local community. Access is free, users are
generally not computer oriented and much of the information on the
system is supplied by local volunteers.</p><p>Current freenet software has a lot of shortcomings which
include being inefficient, not particularly user-friendly and
generally running on expensive hardware. Combining the openness and
capabilities of Linux with this movement could offer a much better
starting point for these freenet projects. And implementing a
freenet on Linux could help us spread the word on how useful Linux
can be.</p><p>In future issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i> I want
to explore the current limitations and see what Linux can offer in
the way of a good base for the freenet of the future. Again, your
input is welcome. If you want to get involved, write me via
<i  >Linux Journal</i> or e-mail
info@linuxjournal.com.</p></div></div>
