    To sail the cyber sea.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8a580.0x1b823f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Purportedly, this article is about how an
&ldquo;obscure&rdquo; operating system called Linux was used to launch a happy
band of netsurfers into the wild ocean of the Internet. But it is
really a rousing tale of adventure and discovery&mdash;with Linux
playing the part of a trusty ship. That ship enabled us to chart a
map of the vast Internet ocean, in the guise of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Netsurfer
Digest</em></span>, a free, sponsor-supported e-zine (electronic
magazine), serving as a gateway to on-line adventure for netsurfers
all over the world.
</p><p>It all started in the spring of 1994 when I gathered together
a small band of netsurfers and, through the proper application of
persuasion, hand waving, and free food, convinced them to put
together an on-line publishing company. Following venerable startup
tradition, we scribbled on numerous coffee house napkins, ate lots
of pizza, exchanged tons of e-mail, and gave birth to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Netsurfer Communications</em></span>. Our goal was to
publish interesting and user-friendly e-zines using the hot new
technology of the World Wide Web.</p><p>Being a fairly on-line literate bunch, we decided that our
products would be made available exclusively on-line, and that the
company would be run as a virtual corporation. We intended to take
every advantage of the vast leverage provided by modern
communication technology. By existing entirely on-line, we would be
able to effortlessly communicate with our consumers, tap a global
pool of talented contributors, and keep our overhead to a
minimum.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8a580.0x1b82660"></a>We Need a Ship</h2></div></div><p>While prototypes of our flagship publication,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Netsurfer Digest</em></span>, were being prepared and the
production process was being designed, a number of technical
decisions had to be made. One of the most important was the choice
of operating system for our production facilities and for our
Internet site. Whatever we chose had to meet a number of fairly
stringent requirements.</p><p>First, we needed a very reliable e-mail platform. Our system
had to be able to support mailing lists serving thousands and
provide reliable e-mail storage for our internal editorial
communications. Second, we needed a reliable World Wide Web and FTP
site. Back issues of our e-zine as well as various background
information had to be made available to people all over the world,
at all hours of the day and night. We also needed the ability to
easily change and update this information, sometimes by automated
scripts. Finally, it was important that whatever environment we
chose supported good development tools. We planned to create a
number of custom programs to aid in production and distribution of
our e-zines.</p><p>It didn't take a genius to figure out that some flavor of
Unix was what we needed. After all, Unix is the native operating
system of the Internet and may well be the best development
environment ever designed. The only question was which brand of
Unix to go with? There were a number of commercial versions
available running on expensive workstations or feature-loaded PCs.
The key word there was &ldquo;expensive&rdquo;. Now, if you've been involved
with startups, then you know that next to the occasionally
scrambled brains of the startup team, the most precious resource is
cash. You only spend it on items absolutely essential for keeping
the venture going, such as marketing, hardware, and pizza. This was
definitely on our minds when the time came to choose our operating
system.</p><p>It just so happened that at the time I had a copy of Linux
available, which I had purchased on CD-ROM from Trans-Ameritech. I
had played around with it at home and had also heard good things
about it from my friends. It appeared to be a full-featured,
relatively robust operating system which might be able to meet our
needs through the early stages of the e-zine. The price was right,
and what's more, we did not need some super-expensive machine to
run it. We had little to lose by giving Linux a try. If it worked,
we had a very inexpensive solution to our requirements. If not,
well, we could always go with one of the more expensive commercial
operating systems, something we figured we'd have to do anyway as
our enterprise grew.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8a580.0x1b828c8"></a>Trimming the Sails</h2></div></div><p>It was clear that Linux was a nice stand-alone operating
system, but we needed to find out if Linux could reliably support
an Internet site. Early in May of 1994 the big day came. I had
already installed Linux version 1.0.9 on our machine, a humble
486DX33 PC with 8 meg of RAM, a 245 meg drive, and an Ethernet
card. The first priority was to see if we could hook it up to the
Ethernet network at our provider site and, from there, work on
getting it on the Internet. So I lugged the machine across the San
Francisco Bay to Berkeley and sat down with our netmaster, Bill
Woodcock, to install it on his network. I was prepared to spend a
few hours fiddling with the system to get it running. I even
brought some snacks to munch on as we worked during the afternoon
on getting the whole contraption to work.</p><p>First, we read the instructions in the Ethernet-HOWTO, which
essentially said to make sure that the kernel had been compiled
with support for our Ethernet card. No problem; I had already done
this. Next we read the NET-2-HOWTO, which told us how to configure
the TCP/IP network. This boiled down to either running a utility
called ifconfig or changing a few well commented lines in the
rc.inet1 and rc.inet2 files. It seemed deceptively simple, and
after we made the changes, Bill and I looked at each other
skeptically and rebooted the machine.</p><p>I've spent all my professional life working with complex
hardware and software systems, first as a mainframe design
engineer, and later, as a software manager. In my long experience,
I've learned that the first time you test a new piece of software,
turn on new hardware, or configure a network, it never works.
Never. There is always some fiddling and adjusting, or even
bug-fixing, which must be done before the whole thing works vaguely
the way it was designed to. That's just the nature of the beast.
Imagine my consternation when the machine came up, recognized the
network, and responded to pings from the rest of the world. This
just does not happen in the real world. I was, frankly, stunned and
amazed. But in a good way.</p><p>In short order, we brought up the standard daemons and had
telnet, FTP, and e-mail going between our machine and the rest of
the network. What I thought would be a long afternoon of debugging
and digging through obscure on-line documentation turned into a
half-hour job. We took the rest of the afternoon off and went out
to get some pizza. I even sprang for extra sauce.</p><p>Bill spent the next few days configuring the machine to our
liking. He arranged domain name registration, set up secure FTP and
WWW software (all freely available on the Net), wrestled with
e-mail configuration, and set up the necessary user accounts. We
were on the Internet and ready to support beta testing of our first
e-zine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Netsurfer Digest</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8a580.0x1b82b88"></a>The Sea Trials</h2></div></div><p>Throughout the summer of 1994, the Linux box supported our
beta effort, which eventually grew to over 1500 users getting
copies of our e-zine twice per week. At the same time we obtained
another PC to be used for development and production. This was
outfitted with X-Windows as a user interface, Perl as the primary
development language, and Seyon as the telecommunications program.
Work proceeded on developing both our editorial process and on
various support tools. So far, Linux was proving to be a very
cost-effective choice and quite flexible as a beta test platform.
However, our voyage was not entirely smooth sailing.</p><p>Early during the Beta test period, we had problems handling
the continually-growing mailing lists. Our problems were caused by
an interaction between our mailing software (smail at the time),
the relatively slow machine, and a slow Internet connection (28.8K
modem). In short order, we located another mailer (sendmail) at a
Linux FTP site, wrote some Perl scripts, and had a working mail
configuration. Linux's flexibility as a development environment was
starting to pay dividends.</p><p>Of greater concern to us was stability. One of the things we
noticed was that the machine was not as stable as we would have
liked. It appeared that, for one reason or another, we had to
reboot two or three times per month, on average. Frequently, this
was due to random segmentation exceptions, or other obscure errors,
which would hang-up our machine for no discernible reason. We could
live with these occasional glitches during our beta test period,
but clearly, this would not do for a production machine which had
to reliably serve thousands of readers. However, since these
glitches did not seriously impact our beta testing effort, we could
put up with them for a while, given the economical nature of the
software in particular. We were a happy and cheap startup.</p><p>By the fall of 1994, we were on the eve of a formal launch of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Netsurfer Digest</em></span>. Our mailing lists were
growing larger and our Internet site was being accessed more and
more often. As part of our effort to prepare for our public debut,
one of the things we did was upgrade our copies of Linux to the
then current version of 1.1.61. We noticed immediately that the new
version appeared much more stable than the earlier 1.0.9. This has,
in fact, proven to be true over the long term, with the latter
version of Linux taking us smoothly through the early days of our
commercial existence.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steady as She Goes: Hauling the Cargo</b></span></p><p>Throughout the winter of '94-'95, Linux performed flawlessly
as our Internet and production platform. Our subscription rates,
and therefore our weekly mailings, were growing at a furious pace.
We reached the point where it took over 24 hours to mail out one
issue to our thousands of direct subscribers. The response time on
our system did slow during a mailing, but Linux took the load and
completed each run.</p><p>The accesses to our WWW server also started taking off. It
seemed that every week we were adding another thousand hits to our
daily access statistics. The real test came in early January, when
we created a special Macintosh issue to coincide with Macworld
Expo. Overnight, accesses to our poor 486DX33 PC topped 10 thousand
per day as Macintosh aficionados overwhelmed us with accesses.
Linux met the load with graceful performance degradation, doing
just what a good operating system should do. There finally came a
point where our faithful system could take no more and the machine
hung. We had pushed our system to its limits.</p><p>By the end of January 1995, Linux was routinely handling over
16 thousand accesses to our Web site every day, with peak loads
reaching almost 20 thousand hits per day. At the same time, we were
handling mailing lists numbering over 15 thousand subscribers for
two different e-zines. It was mind-boggling that this free system
on a relatively puny machine could do all this. We definitely got
value for our money.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8a580.0x1b82fa8"></a>Larger Oceans, Bigger Ships</h2></div></div><p>We realized in late 1994 that there would come a time when we
would have to upgrade our systems to handle the loads imposed by
our dizzy growth rate. Simple math told us that, at some point, our
weekly mailing would impose such a load on the system that people
accessing our site would not be able to get through. Beyond a
certain point, a 486 PC, or even a Pentium, would run out of
horsepower. To handle tens of thousands of subscribers and tens of
thousands of daily hits on our Net site, we would need to upgrade
the speed of our feed, arrange for professional mirror sites, and
get some serious hardware.</p><p>Fortunately, this does not mean that we will abandon Linux.
All of our production and development still takes place on a Linux
PC workstation. Our current machine, now a veteran of a long and
eventful year, will remain hooked up to the Internet as a backup
resource. Linux has proven itself in a very demanding environment.
We have pushed it to its limits and occasionally beyond. We would
not be where we are today without this wonderful operating system,
and by extension, without all those who made it the great and
powerful tool that it is today. We can only hope that by publishing
our free e-zines, by making them entertaining and useful, we can
return something to that vast Internet community without whom we
could not have our dream jobs.</p></div></div>
