    In an effort to corrupt the readers of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Brian
    asks you to take a pair of hypothetical binoculars
    (preferable of the &ldquo;X-ray&rdquo; genre so popular in old comic
    books) and become a &ldquo;Peeping Tom&rdquo; with him, looking into two
    very  different homes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1331580.0x14294a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The first house has something very
different about it, seen even without the binoculars. You can see a
50-foot tower looming high into the sky. On the structure are
scores of antennas in every size and shape imaginable. As you
&ldquo;peer&rdquo; into the den of the house, you see more electronic equipment
than you would expect to find at the local radio station. There are
dials, lights, LEDs, and meters of every kind. There are the sounds
of Morse code, static, and eerie-sounding human (human?) voices.
The man at the equipment has a microphone in front of him, and in
his right hand there is a telegraph operator's key.
</p><p>Now, moving to the second house, we see a typical home, like
you'd expect in Anytown, USA. Nothing unusual as we approach it. So
get out the binoculars! (Come on, get into the shadows. Someone
will see us!)</p><p>In the den of this home, we find an ordinary-looking man
sitting at his personal computer. His eyes seem a bit bleary, but
he seems to be enjoying whatever it is that he is doing. Looking
closer, you can see that the operating system is obviously Linux,
as he swaps virtual consoles at the speed of light. But then he
stops on one VC which seems to be an IRC-type chat group, but
instead of &ldquo;handles&rdquo;, each VC is identified by a cryptic series of
letters and numbers...</p><p>Okay, put the binoculars down. What do these two men have in
common? They are <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> amateur radio operators.
And amateurs have been migrating to Linux in remarkable numbers. In
this article, I'll try to give the non-amateur a feel for why this
is occurring, from an insider's viewpoint (yes, I'm one of them:
KO4KS is my amateur radio callsign).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1331580.0x1429710"></a>What is the Amateur Radio Service?</h2></div></div><p>Without getting into the nitty-gritty details of it, the
countries of the world cooperate together to provide radio spectrum
for use by licensed operators for experimentation, public service,
and just plain fun!</p><p>Amateurs have a wide variety of radio-related ways to enjoy
their hobby. There is the traditional Morse code, shortwave, as
well as local voice communications. In addition, among others,
there are satellite communications, participation with the space
program, and something called packet radio.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1331580.0x1429870"></a>What is Amateur Packet Radio?</h2></div></div><p>Most of you have probably seen e-mail addresses in the
&ldquo;ampr.org&rdquo; domain. These are addresses of amateur radio operators,
using packet radio. But how did they get on the Internet? Don't get
ahead of me....</p><p>Packet radio is described by some as Ethernet over radio
(though Ethernet used to be described as packet radio over wire).
Anything you can do over Ethernet can be done over packet. Packet
operators and programmers have been highly involved in many
Internet RFCs as they have found ways around the problems
encountered in using radio in this manner.</p><p>Packet radio uses a variation of the X.25 protocol called
AX.25 (Amateur X.25). Their radios are connected to their computers
with a little packet modem.</p><p>Initially, the &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; of packet radio was the Packet
BBS (PBBS). PBBSs are pretty crude by today's BBS standards, but
they pass messages internationally by means of thousands of
individually owned radio sites that relay the mail, hop by hop
along the way. Some packet PBBSs have HF (&ldquo;High Frequency&rdquo;--which,
paradoxically, is at the very low end of the frequencies used for
packet radio) ports for passing the mail over longer hops, but most
hops are only a few miles each.</p><p>Then, several years ago, Phil Karn/KA9Q wrote a program
called NET, to incorporate AX25 and TCP/IP together on computers
running MS-DOS. As time progressed, NET became NOS (Network
Operating System), which was now a multi-threaded application
allowing multiple incoming and outgoing sessions. I am told that
some commercial manufacturers have licensed the KA9Q code as a base
for their development, and many of the new and modified protocols
have made their way into commercial wireless TCP/IP
networks.</p><p>Phil made his code available freely to amateurs and for
educational purposes and even has allowed variations to spring up.
There are many &ldquo;xNOSs&rdquo;, such as WNOS, JNOS, PMNOS, etc. and others
that I'm sure I missed. I'm a little partial to Tampa NOS (TNOS),
since I am the one who has developed this variation.</p><p>This interest in TCP/IP leads very naturally to Linux, but
even more so when you consider the limitations of a program like
xNOS under MSDOS. Good ol' DOS doesn't have a linear memory map,
TCP/IP or multitasking built in. And it <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span>
have the 640K conventional memory barrier. It also requires
dedicating a computer to xNOS under DOS.</p><p>Packet Radio Meets Linux</p><p>Linux is a good move for xNOS, since the DOS-related
restrictions are gone. A couple of xNOSs have already been ported
to Linux, including TNOS. Those interested can find it at
ftp.lantz.com:/tnos/current/linux. For Web slingers, try
<a href="http://www.lantz.com" target="_self">www.lantz.com</a>.</p><p>NOS under Linux is still a large program, with all of the
same features as the DOS version, including its own TCP/IP stack.
You can connect TNOS to the Linux TCP/IP stack by means of a ptty
SLIP or PPP link.</p><p>Amateur Radio TCP/IP is passed over the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> Internet by Amateur gateways. These
gateways exist both on the Internet and on the local packet
network. Other non-gateway Amateur packet stations can pass packets
through the gateway to Amateur stations on the other side of
distant gateways. This is done by encapsulating the 44.xx.xx.xx
addresses (addresses assigned to the ampr.org domain) into &ldquo;real&rdquo;
Internet addresses for passing through the backbones.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1331580.0x1429df0"></a>An Amateur TCP/IP Gateway Tour</h2></div></div><p>In visiting a TNOS system, you will find many things that are
familiar. Various core Internet protocols are supported, such as
FTP, SMTP, POP, ICMP. Many familiar applications, like
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span>, can also be found.</p><p>You will find things that are new, too. A telnet connection,
rather than a login to a shell program, will find you placed in a
Packet Bulletin Board System. You will find specialized information
servers and other goodies.</p><p>And then there are conference bridge applications. These are
the amateur radio equivalant of IRC. You could be &ldquo;chatting&rdquo; with
amateurs around the world.</p><p>I said &ldquo;could&rdquo; because most Amateur Radio gateways are
secured very heavily: partly for the same reasons that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> would secure your system on the Internet,
and also because Amateur Radio operators have certain laws to which
they are held accountable regarding the content of the information
transmitted over their radios.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1331580.0x142a0b0"></a>What Next?</h2></div></div><p>AX.25 support has been added to the Linux kernel, and it is
maturing quite well, thanks to the efforts of Alan Cox and several
others. As this becomes more and more usable, the large xNOS
applications will probably become history, with their unique
functions becoming stand-alone daemon programs which will run in
the background. Several TNOS-specific features have already been
made into stand-alone programs. Additional Internet services will
become readily available via Amateur Radio, e.g. Gopher, World Wide
Web, NNTP, etc.</p><p>So, expect to see increasing numbers of Amateur Radio
operators coming to Linux. You can take this as a welcome addition,
as they are some of the most innovative and technologically sound
individuals to be found. Now, when you read magazine articles that
say that both the Internet and wireless technologies are on the
increase, maybe you will have a better understanding as to
why.</p></div></div>
