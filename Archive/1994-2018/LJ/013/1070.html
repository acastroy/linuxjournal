    Do you like Linux, but need to use DOS programs? Dean
    Oisboid recently braved the wilds of the Linux DOS emulator
    and has returned with the answer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd30580.0xe283f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome back. In the first
Novice-to-Novice article, we installed Linux to an existing DOS
setup using UMSDOS and without needing to repartition. This is one
of the great beauties of Linux for PC users&mdash;being able to try it
without losing their DOS setup.
</p><p>If you read the first article, you know it took me a few
tries to get a good installation, the problem primarily being not
enough hard drive space despite reserving 150 megabytes for this
purpose. Since then, I must confess, I reinstalled one more time,
and by being very picky regarding which files to install, I managed
to keep Linux down to about 80 megabytes of the 150
available.</p><p>Also I discovered that Slackware defaults to four virtual
consoles set up for login, with X coming up on the fifth virtual
console. While this was great for switching between screens using
the Alt-F buttons, the resulting lack of RAM (I only have 8 MB)
interfered with many programs, most notably
<span   class="bold"><b>seyon</b></span> (a modem program) under
X-Windows. The solution was to edit the /etc/inittab file and
comment out (by putting a # character at the beginning of the lines
mentioning tty3 and tty4) the third and fourth virtual consoles.
Rebooting with this freed up a lot of memory, allowing X and seyon
to run a bit smoother.</p><p>For this article, we'll explore a unique facet to Linux:
running MS- or PC-DOS under Linux via
<span   class="bold"><b>dosemu</b></span>. (Windows emulation using
WINE is still in its infancy and was covered in the August 1994
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.)</p><p>Why try dosemu? Put simply, emulators allow you to use
multiple operating systems at one time. The flexibility that this
gives the user is something that is not available in Windows and
DOS, but it is available under Linux. There are also other
emulators available for other operating systems; the brave can try
an Apple II+ emulator or an &ldquo;iBCS2&rdquo; emulator that allows the user
to run binaries intended for other Unix systems. You can see that
Linux may well stand as the vanguard of a quiet yet extraordinarily
powerful revolution&mdash;that of function and utility over sheer profit
margin.</p><p>Enough of that, let's do it!</p><p>For the record, I tested version 0.53 patch level 28 of
dosemu. This is the distribution I received on my Slackware
Professional 2.1 disks. (As always with projects in development,
these versions were obsolete even before the CDs were mastered.)
The latest development version of dosemu is 0.53pl45 as of this
writing, and the developers plan to have a stable, public release
available soon after Linux 1.2.0 is released.</p><p>I copied /tsx-11/ALPHA/dosemu/Development</p><p>/pre0.53_28.tgz to /usr using
<span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span>, the Midnight Commander&mdash;the
great Norton Commander clone&mdash;which also, via an option under F2,
allowed me to unzip and untar the file once it was copied
over.</p><p>If you have purchased any Linux documentation, you may have
discovered that information on dosemu is skimpy. There is a HOWTO,
but it doesn't cover using the emulator in conjunction with UMSDOS
nor how to begin, except for a reference QuickStart to a file that
comes with dosemu. Looking through this file, another thing you'll
notice is that dosemu will need to be compiled. Time for a heart
attack.</p><p>Two immediate caveats: One, you will need to have
<span   class="bold"><b>bison</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>flex</b></span> (installed from Slackware's
`D' set), otherwise the compilation process will crash. Second, you
want to backup any important DOS files and prepare a DOS system
boot disk. I insist!</p><p>If you want to compile this version of dosemu, the
installation recommends having a sum total of 12-20MB of RAM and
swap available. My computer has only 8MB of RAM and dosemu just
wouldn't compile. Swap space was definitely needed. I had not ever
tried setting up swap but decided to give it a try.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Novice Note:</b></span> If you decide
to create a swap space (while using UMSDOS) you
<span   class="bold"><b>must&mdash;must, must</b></span>--repartition your
hard disk. If you go through the creation process without
repartitioning and referring to that partition, expect to lose
something. My hard disk got slaughtered! Linux wouldn't recognize
directories. A reboot wouldn't bring up DOS. Panic? Heart attack?
Wet pants? Oh yes, and then some. Luckily I had a DOS boot disk,
and Norton Disk Doctor was able to put things right and restore the
FAT (File Allocation Table) and system files. Sigh of relief! This
is how religions get started.</p><p>What I really wanted, since it doesn't require
repartitioning, was a <span   class="emphasis"><em>swapfile</em></span> for my swap.
Peter Scott of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory pointed this out to me
and gave me a clue as to the commands to do the job. In a normal
Unix system, he also mentioned, you would want a large partitioned
swap space, around 50MB or so. I shook my head; my hard drive was
down to 30MB because of a sudden influx of vital games and
work-related data. [Linux requires less swap space than normal Unix
systems because it uses memory somewhat differently&mdash;ED]</p><p>According to the System Administration manual, you create a
swap file called /swap with the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=8192
mkswap /swap 8192
sync
swapon /swap
</pre><p>This will create an 8MB swap file. Even if you decide to skip
using dosemu, you could still benefit from using swap. For example,
I've been playing with a copy of Netscape in X, but without swap,
it wouldn't allow me to access the preferences menu. It would
crash. But with the swap active, preferences and other menus became
available. This was a real testament to the value of swap
space.</p><p>In order to cause the swap file to be used each time you
boot, you can add swapon /swap to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file.
However, a better way is to add the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/swap  none  swap  defaults  0  0
</pre><p>to your /etc/fstab file. This will cause the swap to be
automatically added at the best possible time.</p><p>If you ever desperately need the disk space back, you can
delete the swap file with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
swapoff /swap
rm /swap
</pre><p>If you have added a line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local or /etc/fstab,
make sure that you remove that line.</p><p>With a swap file in place and active, I tackled the
compilation of dosemu again. Reading through the QuickStart file
knotted my stomach but I followed instructions. The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make most
</pre><p>started the dirty work of compilation. I do not have
<span   class="bold"><b>TeX</b></span> (an advanced typesetting
system) installed, so this was the correct command instead of
<b  >make doeverything</b>. After some time of grinding,
the compilation finished. No crashing errors! The instructions then
said to copy hdimage.dist to /var/lib/dosemu/hdimage and also to
copy and edit /examples/config.dist to /etc/dosemu.conf.</p><p>Editing /etc/dosemu.conf was straight-forward. The only lines
I really had to change were for my mouse and modem; I also had to
uncomment the reference to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
disk { image "/var/lib/dosemu/hdimage" }
</pre><p>The sample dosemu.conf file that was provided has extensive
comments explaining what to do.</p><p>With that done, I then prepared the recommended boot disk by
returning to DOS and formatting a system disk. Then back to
Linux.</p><p>Finally, I typed in dos, and sure enough, the boot disk
booted and I was staring at the familiar A: prompt. From there if I
typed C: I was brought to an image of a C: drive.</p><p>Nice, but not what I was expecting. The goal was to be able
to access my current DOS system through Linux, not have a faux DOS
image.</p><p>Going back into the /etc/dosemu.conf file, I switched the
hard drive reference to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
disk { partition "/dev/hda1" 1 readonly }
</pre><p>This would allow me to access the hard drive but not change
anything because of the readonly mode. Yet when I started dosemu
nothing happened. What the heck, I changed the disk reference
to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
disk { wholedisk "/dev/hda" }
</pre><p>which would allow full and potentially dangerous access.
Typed dos and sure enough dosemu started to load. First thing
noticeable was a message saying something about QEMM (Quarterdeck's
memory manager program) not being loaded because the processor was
already in Virtual 86 mode. Without QEMM, many of the other memory
residents didn't get loaded. A check using DOS mem showed that the
mouse and CD drivers were missing (not surprisingly, since dosemu
provides its own mouse and CD drivers). Yet in all, I had 599K free
RAM. Not too bad. However, the real test would be to run a program.
[dosemu provides the basic functionality of QEMM&mdash;it provides as
much EMS and XMS memory as you want it to&mdash;ED]</p><p>Unfortunately, while the documentation says that wholedisk
access is dangerous, it is easy to miss why it is dangerous. It
turns out that a DOS file system can be destroyed by using
wholedisk access to that partition while that partition is mounted
by the kernel, either as a Ms-dos or UMSDOS file system.</p><p>After experiencing some file system damage, I found out that
there is a way to make my DOS C: drive also be my C: drive under
the DOS emulator without doing damage and without booting from a
floppy. Taking a hint from a comment in dosemu.conf, and with a
little help from a friend, I first edited config.sys on my boot
floppy, adding the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
device=a:\emufs.sys /dos/
</pre><p>which makes the /dos directory under Linux show up as C:
under dosemu. I also added the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
a:\lredir d: linux\fs\
</pre><p>to autoexec.bat to make the Linux root directory show up as
D: under dosemu, to make it easier to access some Linux files from
within dosemu.</p><p>I then enter</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/var/lib/dosemu/floppy
</pre><p>with my boot floppy in drive A. Then, in the floppy
configuration section of dosemu.conf, I changed</p><pre     class="programlisting">
floppy { device /dev/fd0 threeinch }:
</pre><p>to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
floppy { heads 2 sectors 18 tracks 80 threeinch
file /var/lib/dosemu/floppy }
floppy { device /dev/fd0 threeinch }
</pre><p>by modifying and uncommenting a few lines. I changed the
<b  >bootC</b> line to <b  >bootA</b> and
removed the <b  >wholedisk</b> line that damaged my
files. Now I could boot without a floppy in the drive, but C: was
still C:. [There are other ways to do the same thing, but this
works fine&mdash;ED]</p><p>Sadly, it still seemed that nothing would run. Quattro Pro 5
for DOS crashed mightily. Warlords II did the same. The crashes
were bad enough to not only lock up the computer but when I did a
Ctrl-Alt-Delete to reboot, the screen filled with colorful garbage.
This rather pretty effect also happened if I switched virtual
consoles.</p><p>Although I hated to ask for any help, I sent a message to
James MacLean, who is the current maintainer of dosemu, asking if
anyone else had success using dosemu under UMSDOS. Three replies
came quickly back from Mr. MacLean, Marty Leisner, and Lars
Marowsky-Bree. All offered help, which I politely declined because
their very replies gave me the incentive I needed&mdash;the knowledge
that, indeed, someone had succeeded!</p><p>Back in Linux, I glared mightily at dosemu.conf&mdash;and bless it
if the answer wasn't there all the time. A section of the
configuration file deals with the video setup. Originally I had
chosen:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
video { vga console }
</pre><p>but I should have chosen:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
video { vga console graphics }
</pre><p>to enable graphics. This worked! When I ran dos and picked
the bare boot setup, sure enough, I could now run programs like
Warlords II or Quattro Pro 5.</p><p>But the mouse wouldn't work. AAARRGHH!! OK,
<b  >exitemu</b> to return to Linux, edit
/etc/dosemu.conf, and change the line from:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
serial { com 1 mouse }
</pre><p>to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
serial {com 1 device /dev/mouse }
</pre><p>and try once again. No good. DOS just couldn't find the mouse
as if...as if the mouse were already in use. GPM! (General Purpose
Mouse driver) My Linux setup automatically loads gpm upon booting.
Using top, I located the process number for gpm and
<b  >kill</b>-ed it. [<b  >killall gpm</b>
would also work&mdash;ED] Back to DOS, load the mouse driver. YES! DOS
recognizes the mouse. YES! Warlords II runs with mouse support!
YES! Quattro Pro v5 runs with mouse support! NO! FoxPro 2.6 crashes
because of memory problems (I expected that but the lucky streak
was there and I had to press it). [FoxPro 2.6 can also be run with
the correct configuration&mdash;ED]</p><p>Whew! Despite all my problems with compiling, swaps, and
pretty color crashes, I consider dosemu an incredible achievement.
That DOS can run under Linux is mind-boggling. Sure, dosemu can be
rough going for us newbies but the potential reward makes up for
it. There are a few things being worked on now that will make it
easier. One is the FreeDOS project which is writing a free version
of DOS. It will run under dosemu just like MS-DOS, except that
dosemu can be distributed with it pre-installed, saving the user
(that's you!) the pain of installing a legally-owned copy of
MS-DOS, PC-DOS, or DRDOS to get started. Also, the public release
of dosemu should be very stable and easier to distribute.</p><p>Next month, the lighter side of Linux as Novice-to-Novice
descends into the depths of DOOM and tackles blasting sound using a
SoundBlaster. Until then...</p></div></div>
