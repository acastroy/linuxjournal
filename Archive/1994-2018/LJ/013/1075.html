    How old is Linux? The Linux project was started about four
    years ago, but the Linux distributions are really far more
    than four years old. Linux is the product of many years of
    hard work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c62580.0x1d5a3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Everyone knows that the Linux operating
system was created from scratch about four years ago, right?
Actually, while the Linux project is itself only four years old, it
is important to remember that large parts of the Linux system on
your desk are far older.
</p><p>Linux is not an entire operating system&mdash;it is an operating
system kernel. Any Unix or Unix-like operating system kernel
requires a large suite of utility programs to complete the entire
operating system. The Unix kernel has historically been distributed
with many text manipulation tools, a C language compiler,
programming libraries, and on-line documentation for all (or almost
all) of the utilities and libraries. All of this together comprises
the operating system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c62580.0x1d5a500"></a>Some History</h2></div></div><p>Years before Linux was started, programmers who were fed up
with bugs and limitations in the standard versions of Unix
utilities started to write their own versions and contribute them
to the Free Software Foundation's &ldquo;GNU&rdquo; project. Slowly, over the
years, programmers noticed bugs and limitations in nearly all Unix
utilities and wrote replacements for them, freeing the users from
having to rely on software vendors to be consistently
perfect.</p><p>These replacements were ported to most &ldquo;flavors&rdquo; of Unix that
were available&mdash;but they all still required a commercial kernel,
and the users were still dependent on their Unix software vendors
to fix bugs and remove limitations in the kernel. The Free Software
Foundation (known as the FSF) started work on a replacement kernel
(now called &ldquo;The Hurd&rdquo;), but work was slow, original efforts met
with legal challenges, and although the legal questions have long
been settled, The Hurd has still not been publicly released.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c62580.0x1d5a660"></a>More Recent History</h2></div></div><p>In the spring of 1991, Linus Torvalds, a college student in
Finland, started writing a 32-bit terminal emulator for his 386. He
wrote it in a combination of assembly language and C, and in order
to learn more about the 386 chip, made the emulator completely
independent of DOS or any other operating system. Over the next few
months, he learned enough to turn his terminal emulator into the
beginnings of a Unix-like kernel.</p><p>To compile his code, Linus used the FSF's gcc C compiler and
assembler. As a shell, he used the FSF's bash (&ldquo;bourne again
shell&rdquo;). For the <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> program, he
used the FSF's GNU make. In short, he and the team that quickly
assembled around him used nearly all of the FSF's GNU programs to
complement the Linux kernel and assemble a complete operating
system.</p><p>These pre-tested and refined utilities turned a Unix-like
kernel into a Unix-like operating system overnight. Many users who
are not very familiar with the Free Software Foundation's suite of
utilities are under the impression that the entire Linux operating
system has been developed completely from scratch in the last four
years. In reality, Linux leveraged (to use a current buzzword) a
huge amount of tested, quality code to turn a kernel into an
operating system, virtually overnight&mdash;the GNU project has enabled
the Linux operating system to take the world by storm. Most of
what's really new is the name and the kernel&mdash;much of the rest is
GNU.</p><p>This does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> belittle the kernel. It is
large and complex, and there are few people who have the
combination of qualities required to write&mdash;and especially
maintain&mdash;one. It merely points out that Linux is in reality not a
four-year-old newcomer, but a respectable, mature option for Unix
users.</p><p>This new, powerful combination of the FSF's GNU utilities and
the Linux kernel has in turn contributed to the quality of the GNU
utilities. Because Linux users rely exclusively on the GNU
utilities, when they find a bug in a GNU utility, they cannot
simply fall back and use the version of the utility that came with
the system. This means that more people are working on fixing those
bugs that still exist in the GNU utilities, making them even more
stable than they used to be. Those bug fixes (and enhancements) are
usually given back to the FSF, as is appropriate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c62580.0x1d5a978"></a>Other Contributors</h2></div></div><p>Not all of the utilities that Linux uses come from the GNU
project. The University of California at Berkeley had a
long-running project which produced the Berkeley Software
Distribution of Unix, known simply as BSD. Since much of the Unix
networking software was developed by and for Bed's distribution of
Unix, the BSD networking utilities still define the standards, and
so many of the Linux networking utilities are time-tested utilities
from BSD. As another example: thanks to the work done by MIT and
the corporate members of the X Consortium, Linux had a well-tested,
respected GUI less than a year after the project started.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c62580.0x1d5aa80"></a>True Innovation</h2></div></div><p>Linux, as innovative as it is, has been created from
&ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo; technology&mdash;it has gone fast and far on the
shoulders of giants. It has employed (for the most part) proven
technology to give users a truly open operating system.</p><p>The most important innovation Linux has given users is not
the code, but the license. Because Linux is licensed under the
FSF's GNU Public License, users have control, and are not tied to a
vendor's apron strings. This creates a market for support, and
users who are dissatisfied with the support they are receiving have
the option to switch support providers. Not only is there a market
for support, but users are also enabled to fix problems and enhance
the software themselves, if they are so inclined.</p><p>Neither of those options truly exists for operating systems
that do not include source; those options demonstrate the true
innovation of Linux.</p></div></div>
