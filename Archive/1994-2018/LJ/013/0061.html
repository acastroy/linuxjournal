After reviewing a copy, I can say that SSC has produced a useful
&ldquo;Linux Resource Guide&rdquo; of &ldquo;Resources, Technical Information, and
Articles from <i  >Linux Journal</i>&rdquo;, with an emphasis (as we might expect)
on <i  >Linux Journal</i> articles.</p><p>To help demonstrate the organization of the book, I will list
the table of contents:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An Introduction to Linux</p></li><li><p>Linux in the Real World</p></li><li><p>Talking about Linux</p></li><li><p>Politics, Opinions and Future of Linux</p></li><li><p>Linux and Other Operating Systems</p></li><li><p>Technical Articles</p></li><li><p>Systems Administration</p></li></ol></div><p>Also included are a Glossary and an Appendices. Each of these
seven main sections has anywhere from three to six articles,
selected mostly from <i  >LJ</i>. A nice feature of this organization is
that one doesn't have to leaf through seven or eight issues of <i  >LJ</i>
to read about one of the topics above. For example, two interviews
with Linus Torvalds that were published in issue 1 and issue 9 are
placed back to back in chapter 3 and Chet Ramey's bash articles
from issues 3 &amp; 4 are a single seamless article in chapter
6.</p><p>Chapter 1 is comprised of two parts. The first three articles
discuss the history&mdash;albeit in a broad overview&mdash;of Linux and will
probably be used as background for many other publications. The
next three articles are more of the what-is-available-for-me-now
type and will be dated in a few years (I hope not sooner than
that).</p><p>Chapter 2 has brief case studies of how Linux systems either
replaced older mini-computers and improved upon their functionality
and&mdash;user satisfaction&mdash;or how Linux systems solved new problems.
These are well-written and should prove useful if one is trying to
get a supervisor to authorize using Linux at work.</p><p>Chapter 3 has interviews with Linus Torvalds, Slackware's Pat
Volkerding, and DOSEmu team leader James MacLean. I enjoyed the
interviews, but I already enjoyed them in the various issues of <i  >LJ</i>
as well.</p><p>Chapter 4 seemed lacking to me. Although each of these
articles was interesting in <i  >LJ</i>, I feel that they lose something
when brought together. Perhaps because the content of each article
stimulates thinking, dreaming and imagining about the future, the
effect is lost when they are read sequentially. I suggest reading
them at least a sleep apart.</p><p>Chapter 5 is another useful one. An article comparing memory
and disk requirements for Linux, Windows NT, and OS/2 appears to be
a thorough evaluation. The remaining articles discuss emulators to
run other code on Linux&mdash;iBCS2, which runs binaries for other
Intel-based Unices; mtools, not really an emulator, but a set of
tools for accessing MS-DOS file systems (particularly on floppy
disk) from Linux; Wine, an MS-Windows emulator that is still in
test mode; and SAMBA, an implementation for Linux of the SMB
protocol (used by LanManager, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT,
and OS/2). SAMBA was the only one of these that I had not heard of
before I read about it in <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>Chapter 6 contains articles on porting other Unix
applications to Linux, the GNU C Library, and bash. These are all
pithy but meaty articles, yet I do not like this section being
called &ldquo;Technical Articles&rdquo;. Perhaps something like &ldquo;Tips for
Programmers&rdquo; would have been a better title.</p><p>Chapter 7 barely scratches the surface of system
administration, but what is there is well-written.</p><p>The Glossary is generally good, but I have a few quibbles:
e.g.: &ldquo;Cisco A brand of router&rdquo;.</p><p>In the Appendix are found &ldquo;Linux Products and Services
Directory&rdquo;, &ldquo;Linux User Groups&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Linux Resources&rdquo;. These are
fine now, but some of the references have to be updated already.
For example, in the list of Usenet usegroups, page 211 doesn't
reflect the most recent division of the comp.os.linux newsgroups.
Therefore, the newsgroup comp.os.linux.setup, one invaluable for
those new to Linux and Unix, is not included.</p><p>Overall, this is a worthwhile book, even for those who have
been subscribing to <i  >LJ</i> since Issue 1. The collection of related
topics, the good glossary, and the list of newsgroups, ftp sites,
products and services, all together in one volume, make it a source
that you want next to the Network Administrator's Guide, Linux
Installation &amp; Getting Started, and the HOWTOs. This reference
(which could also be named The <i  >Linux Journal</i> Sampler) does nothing
to tarnish SSC's reputation.</p></div></div>
