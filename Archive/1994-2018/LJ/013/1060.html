    The Executable and Linking Format has been a popular topic lately,
    as people ask why the kernel configuration script asks whether or not
    to configure loading ELF executables. Since ELF will eventually be
    the common object file format for Linux binaries, it is appropriate to
    document it a bit. Last month, Eric introduced us to ELF, and this
    month,
    he gives us a guided tour of real ELF files.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8e580.0x1b86450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we reached a point where were
beginning to dissect some real ELF files. For this, I will use the
<span   class="bold"><b>readelf</b></span> utility which I wrote when
I was first trying to understand the ELF format itself. Later on,
it became a valuable tool for debugging the linker as I added
support for ELF. The sources to readelf should be on tsx-11.mit.edu
in pub/linux/packages/GCC/src or in pub/linux/BETA/ibcs2.
</p><p>Let us start with a very simple program&mdash;the hello world
program we used last month.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% cat hello.c
main()
{
        printf("Hello World\n");
}
largo% gcc-elf -c hello.c
</pre><p>On my laptop, the gcc-elf command invokes the ELF version of
gcc&mdash;once ELF becomes the default format, you will be able to use
the regular gcc command which produces the ELF file hello.o. Each
ELF file starts with a header (<b  >struct elfhdr</b> in
/usr/include/linux/elf.h), and the readelf utility can display the
contents of all of the fields:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% readelf -h hello.o
ELF magic:7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00
        00 00 00 00
Type, machine, version = 1 3 1
Entry, phoff, shoff, flags = 0 0 440 0
ehsize, phentsize, phnum = 52 0 0
shentsize, shnum, shstrndx = 40 11 8
</pre><p>The ELF <b  >magic</b> field is just a way of
unambiguously identifying this as an ELF file. If a file does not
contain those 16 bytes in the <b  >magic</b> field, it is
not an ELF file. The type, machine, and version fields identify
this as an ET_REL file (i.e., an object file) for the i386. The
<b  >ehsize</b> field is just the <b  >sizeof(struct
elfhdr)</b>.</p><p>Each ELF file contains a table that describes the sections
within the file. The <b  >shnum</b> field indicates that
there are 11 sections; the <b  >shoff</b> field indicates
that the section header table starts at byte offset 440 within the
file. The <b  >shentsize</b> field indicates that the
entry for each section is 40 bytes long. All throughout ELF, the
sizes of various structures are always explicitly stated. This
allows for flexibility; the structures can be expanded as required
for some hardware platforms and the standard ELF tools do not have
to know about this to be able to make sense of the binary. Also, it
allows room for future expansion of the structures by newer
versions of the standard.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
largo% readelf -S hello.o
There are 11 section headers, starting at offset 1b8:
[0]             NULL            00000000 00000 00000 00 / 0 0 0 0

</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 1.</b></span> Section Table for hello.o
</p><p>Each section header is just a <b  >struct
ELF32_Shdr</b>. You may notice that the name field is just a
number&mdash;this is not a pointer, but an offset into the .shstrtab
section (we can find the index of the .shstrtab section from the
file header in the <b  >shstrndx</b> field). Thus we find
the name of each section at the specified offset within the
.shstrtab section. Let us dump the section table for this file; see
figure 1. You will notice sections for nearly everything which we
have already discussed. Each section has an identifier which
specifies what the section contains (in general, you should never
have to actually know the name of a section or compare it to
anything).</p><p>After the type, there is a series of numbers. The first of
these is the address in virtual memory where this section should be
loaded. Since this is a .o file, it is not intended to be loaded
into virtual memory, and this field is not filled in. Next is the
offset within the file of the section, and then is the size of the
section. After this come a series of numbers&mdash;I won't parse these
in detail for you, but they contain things like the required
alignment of the section, a set of flags which indicate whether the
section is read-only, writable, and/or executable.</p><p>The readelf program is capable of performing
disassembly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% readelf -i 1 hello.o
0x00000000  pushl       %ebp
0x00000001  movl        %esp,%ebp
0x00000003  pushl       $0x0
0x00000008  call        0x08007559
0x0000000d  addl        $4,%esp
0x00000010  movl        %ebp,%esp
0x00000012  popl        %ebp
0x00000013  ret
</pre><p>The .rel.text section contains the relocations for the .text
section of the file, and we can display them as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% readelf -r hello.o
Relocation section data:.rel.text (0x2 entries)
Tag: 00004 Value 00301 R_386_32    (0 )
Tag: 00009 Value 00b02 R_386_PC32  (0 printf)
</pre><p>This indicates that the .text section has two relocations. As
expected, there is a relocation for printf indicating that we must
patch the address of printf into offset 9 from the beginning of the
.text section, which happens to be the operand of the call
instruction. There is also a relocation so that we pass the correct
address to printf.</p><p>Now let us see what happens when this file is linked into an
executable. The section table now looks something like
<a href="1060l1.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>The first thing you will notice is a lot more sections than
were in the simple .o file. Much of this because this file requires
the ELF shared library libc.so.1.</p><p>At this point I should mention the mechanics of what happens
when you run an ELF program. The kernel looks through the binary
and loads it into the user's virtual memory. If the application is
linked to a shared library, the application will also contain the
name of the dynamic linker that should be used. The kernel then
transfers control to the dynamic linker, not to the application.
The dynamic loader is responsibile for first initializing itself,
loading the shared libraries into memory, resolving all remaining
relocations, and then transferring control to the
application.</p><p>Going back to our executable, the .interp section simply
contains an ASCII string that is the name of the dynamic loader.
Currently this will always be /lib/elf/ld-linux.so.1 (the dynamic
loader itself is also an ELF shared library).</p><p>Next you will notice 3 sections, called .hash, .dynsym, and
.dynstr. This is a minimal symbol table used by the dynamic linker
when performing relocations. You will notice that these sections
are mapped into virtual memory (the virtual address field is
non-zero). At the very end of the image are the regular symbol and
string tables, and these are not mapped into virtual memory by the
loader. The .hash section is just a hash table that is used so that
we can quickly locate a given symbol in the .dynsym section,
thereby avoiding a linear search of the symbol table. A given
symbol can typically be located in one or two tries through the use
of the hash table.</p><p>The next section I want to mention is the .plt section. This
contains the jump table that is used when we call functions in the
shared library. By default the .plt entries are all initialized by
the linker not to point to the correct target functions, but
instead to point to the dynamic loader itself. Thus, the first time
you call any given function, the dynamic loader looks up the
function and fixes the target of the .plt so that the next time
this .plt slot is used we call the correct function. After making
this change, the dynamic loader calls the function itself.</p><p>This feature is known as lazy symbol binding. The idea is
that if you have lots of shared libraries, it could take the
dynamic loader lots of time to look up all of the functions to
initialize all of the .plt slots, so it would be preferable to
defer binding addresses to the functions until we actually need
them. This turns out to be a big win if you only end up using a
small fraction of the functions in a shared library. It is possible
to instruct the dynamic loader to bind addresses to all of the .plt
slots before transferring control to the application&mdash;this is done
by setting the environment variable
<b  >LD_BIND_NOW=1</b> before running the program. This
turns out to be useful in some cases when you are debugging a
program, for example. Also, I should point out that the .plt is in
read-only memory. Thus the addresses used for the target of the
jump are actually stored in the .got section. The .got also
contains a set of pointers for all of the global variables that are
used within a program that come from a shared library.</p><p>The .dynamic section contains some shorthand notes used by
the dynamic loader. You will notice that the section table is not
itself loaded into virtual memory, and in fact it would not be good
for performance for the dynamic loader to have to try to parse it
to figure out what needs to be done. The .dynamic section is
essentially just a distilled version of the section header table
that contains just what is needed for the dynamic loader to do its
job.</p><p>You will notice that since the section header table is not
loaded into memory, neither the kernel nor the dynamic loader will
be able to use that table when loading files into memory. A
shorthand table of program headers is added to provide a distilled
version of the section table containing just the information
required to load a file into memory. For the above file it looks
something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% readelf -l hello
Elf file is Executable
Entry point 0x8000400
There are 5 program headers, starting at offset 34:
PHDR       0x00034 0x08000034 0x000a0 0x000a0 R E
Interp     0x000d4 0x080000d4 0x00017 0x00017 R

Dynamic    0x0054c 0x0800154c 0x00098 0x00098 RW
Shared library: [libc.so.4] 1
</pre><p>As you can see, the program header contains a pointer to the
name of the dynamic loader, instructions on what portions of the
file are to be loaded into virtual memory (and the virtual
addresses they should be loaded to), the permissions of the
segments of memory, and finally a pointer to the .dynamic section
that the dynamic loader will need. Note that the list of required
shared libraries is stored in the .dynamic section.</p><p>I will not pick apart an ELF shared library for you
here&mdash;libraries look quite similar to ELF executables. If you are
interested, you can get the readelf utility and pick apart your own
libraries.</p><p>At the start of this article, I said one reason we were
switching to ELF was that it was easier to build shared libraries
with ELF. I will now demonstrate how. Consider two files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% cat hello1.c
main()
{
        greet();
}
largo% cat english.c
greet()
{
        printf("Hello World\n");
}
</pre><p>The idea is that we want to build a shared library from
english.c, and link hello1 against it. The commands to generate the
shared library are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
largo% gcc-elf -fPIC -c english.c
largo% gcc-elf -shared -o libenglish.so english.o
</pre><p>That's all there is to it. Now we compile and link the hello1
program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% gcc-elf -c hello1.c
largo% gcc-elf -o hello1 hello1.o -L. -lenglish
</pre><p>And finally we can run the program. Normally the dynamic
loader only looks in certain locations for shared libraries, and
the current directory is not one of the places it normally looks.
Thus to run the program, you can use a command like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

largo% LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./hello1
Hello World
</pre><p>The environment variable <b  >LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>
tells the dynamic loader to look in additional places for the
shared libraries (this feature is disabled for setuid programs for
security reasons).</p><p>To avoid having to specify
<b  >LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, you have several options. You
could copy your shared library to /lib/elf, but you can also link
your program in the following way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
largo% gcc-elf -o hello1 hello1.o\ /home/joe/libenglish.so
largo% ./hello1
Hello World
</pre><p>To build more complicated shared libraries, the procedure is
not really that much different. Everything that you want to put
into the shared library should be compiled with
<b  >-fPIC</b>; when you have compiled everything, you
just link it all together with the <b  >gcc -shared</b>
command.</p><p>The procedure is so much simpler mainly because we bind
addresses to functions at runtime. With a.out libraries, the
addresses are bound at link time. This means that lots of special
care must be taken to ensure that the .plt and .got have sufficient
room for future expansion and that we keep the variables at the
same addresses from one version of the library to the next. The
tools for building a.out libraries help ensure all of this, but it
makes the build procedure much more complicated.</p><p>ELF offers one further feature that is not easily available
with a.out. The <span   class="bold"><b>dlopen()</b></span> function
can be used to dynamically load a shared library into the user's
memory, and you are then able to call the dynamic loader to find
symbols within this shared library&mdash;in other words, you can call
functions that are defined in these modules. In addition, the
dynamic loader is used to resolve any undefined symbols within the
module itself.</p><p>This may be easiest to explain with an example. Given the
following source file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;
main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
   void (*greeting)();
   void * module;
   if( argc &gt; 2 ) exit(0);
   module = dlopen(argv[1], RTLD_LAZY);
  if(!module) exit(0);
   greeting = dlsym(module, "greet");
   if(greeting) {
     (*greeting)();
   }
  dlclose(module);
 }
</pre><p>you can compile, link, and run it (using the shared library
english.so which was built earlier):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
largo% gcc-elf -c hello2.c
largo% gcc-elf -o hello2 hello2.o -ldl
largo% ./hello2 ./libenglish.so
Hello World
</pre><p>To expand this example a little bit, you could generate other
modules with greetings in other languages. Thus in theory, one
could add multi-lingual support for some application merely by
supplying a set of shared libraries that contain the
language-specific portions of the application. In the above
example, I showed how you can locate the address of a function
within a shared library. But the
<span   class="bold"><b>dlsym()</b></span> function will also return
the address of data variables, so you could just as easily retrieve
the address of a text string from the shared library.</p><p>As I prepare to close, I should mention some options to
readelf which I have not demonstrated. <b  >readelf
-s</b> dumps the symbol tables and <b  >readelf
-f</b> dumps the .dynamic section.</p><p>Finally, I should mention something about the timetable. When
we first got ELF to a point where it was usable (last September),
we decided to spend a relatively long period of time testing it and
shaking out all of the problems. Back then I felt that roughly
4-to-6 months would allow people to test it thoroughly, plus we
wanted to give an opportunity for certain applications to be
adapted for ELF (the most recent versions of insmod and Wine now
support ELF, for example). As I write this, no firm date has been
set for a public release, but it is possible that ELF will be
public by the time you read this.</p><p>In these articles I have attempted to give you a guided
introduction to the ELF file format. A lot of the material I have
covered is not of much practical value to most users (unless you
want to hack the linker), but my experience is that there are a lot
of people who are curious about how it all works, and I hope that I
have provided enough information to satisfy most people.</p><p>For more information about the ELF file format, you can
obtain the ELF specifications from a number of sources&mdash;you can try
ftp.intel.com in pub/tis/elf11g.zip. The specifications are also
available in a printed format. See <span   class="emphasis"><em>SYSTEM V Application
