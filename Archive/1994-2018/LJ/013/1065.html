    The World Wide Web is designed to be easy to attach to. Not
    just by using Mosaic, Lynx, or Netscape to read other
    people's pages, but also by publishing your own information.
    Eric Kasten tells you how to start.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Access to networked multimedia data has
become commonplace on the Internet. Chances are good that you've
gone <span   class="emphasis"><em>surfing</em></span> in search of data for a project
or technical paper or out of simple curiosity. You have probably
passed through a large number of sites scattered across the globe
and have seen what can be done. Now you want to set up your own
collection of information, images, and sound so that the networked
world can come and visit. One of the first steps is to set up a
world wide web (WWW) server. The remainder of this article will
endeavor to provide the necessary information to successfully
install the WWW server provided by CERN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x19015b0"></a>Preparation and Compilation</h2></div></div><p>The three basic parts of the CERN WWW source package are the
line-mode client, the daemon, and the common library. Of these, the
daemon and common library source are necessary to compile the
server. You may also want to retrieve and compile the client code
for future use. These packages may be retrieved by clicking on the
appropriate links in the document found at URL
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html" target="_self">www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Status.html</a>,
or by anonymous ftp from gatekeeper.dec.com in directory
/put/net/infosys/www/src. The file names are shown in the tar
commands below. Once you have retrieved the tar archives, move them
to the directory where you wish to compile the server, then extract
the source. Using GNU's tar this can be done by executing the
following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzvf WWWDaemon.tar.Z
tar xzvf WWWLibrary.tar.Z
tar xzvf WWWLineMode.tar.Z
</pre><p>The final file and tar command is optional since it extracts
the line-mode client. Once extracted, the source will be in
subdirectory WWW. To build the server under Linux, change to
subdirectory WWW and execute BUILD. This is done as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd WWW
./BUILD
</pre><p>The build process should recognize that it is running on a
Linux system, and proceed to compile the common library followed by
the server. If you have not extracted the source for the line-mode
client, the build process will exit with an error once the server
has been built. This is normal and can be ignored. You can verify
that you have successfully built the server by examining the files
in subdirectory Daemon/linux. In addition to a number of .o files
there should be the following six files:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>cgiparse: A tool for parsing CGI environment
variables.</p></li><li><p>cgiutils: A tool for generating replies from CGI
scripts.</p></li><li><p>htimage: Used to parse the input from a clickable
image.</p></li><li><p>httpd_3.0: The server or daemon.</p></li><li><p>httpd: A symbolic link to httpd_3.0</p></li><li><p>htadm: An administration tool for managing server
access files.</p></li></ul></div><p>CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. CGI is a set of
specifications for how scripts and other programs can interact with
a WWW server.</p><p>Sidebar: <a href="1065s1.html" target="_self">The NCSA http
Daemon</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1901df0"></a>Basic Installation</h2></div></div><p>You may install the server and associated tools in any
directory you see fit. This article assumes that the installation
directory is /usr/local/WWW. If you are installing in some other
directory, be sure to make the necessary changes in the following
references.</p><p>To install the server list, create a user id and a group for
the server. This user id and group will help control what access
rights the server possesses and allow selective access to the
server files for administrative users. This article uses user
<b  >www</b> and group <b  >wwwgroup</b>. They
can be created using your favorite method for adding users and
groups to the system.</p><p>Next, create the directory tree where the server and
associated tools and files will reside. A typical server directory
will have the following directories (and possibly others):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>config: Configuration files.</p></li><li><p>cgi-bin: CGI scripts and programs.</p></li><li><p>icons: Icons.</p></li><li><p>htdocs: HTML documents.</p></li></ul></div><p>To create these directories, execute the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /usr/local/WWW
cd /usr/local/WWW
mkdir config cgi-bin icons htdocs
</pre><p>Now these directories can be populated. Return to the
directory where you compiled the WWW server, and execute the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd Daemon/linux
tar cf - htadm httpd httpd_3.0 | \
  (cd /usr/local/WWW; tar xvf -)
tar cf - htimage cgiparse cgiutils | \
  (cd /usr/local/WWW/cgi-bin; tar xvf -)
cd ../../server_root/icons
tar cf - * | (cd /usr/local/WWW/icons; tar xvf -)
cd ../config
tar cf - * | (cd /usr/local/WWW/config; tar xvf -)
</pre><p>This sequence of commands copies the server binaries, CGI
utility programs, supplied icons, and several example server
configuration files to the proper subdirectories in /usr/local/WWW.
Note how tar is used. This is an often-used method to successfully
copy files, links, and subdirectories without accidentally
modifying links and other characteristics during the copy operation
due to improper flags passed to cp.</p><p>You should also set the ownership and permissions on this
directory tree. Here is a possible set of permissions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local
chown -R www.wwwgroup WWW
chmod a+rx WWW WWW/htdocs WWW/icons \
  WWW/cgi-bin WWW/config
chmod g+rx WWW/httpd_3.0
cd WWW/icons
chmod a+r *
cd ../cgi-bin
chmod a+rx *
</pre><p>These are typical permissions that allow access to the server
when documents or icons are requested or the execution of a CGI
program or script is required. However, it is possible to remove
world permissions from most of these files as long as the server
runs as user www and group wwwgroup (see UserId and GroupId
below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1902630"></a>Basic Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The /usr/local/WWW/config directory contains several example
configuration files. The CERN server has a rich collection of
options, including caching specifications, proxy support, and
access control. This article will cover only a set of the basic
options to get you started.</p><p>Listing 1 is a basic configuration file, which, with the
following descriptions, you can modify to get your server up and
running. This file should be created in /usr/local/WWW/config/ and
can have any name you desire; however, here it will be called
cern_httpd.conf. The default file name that the server will search
for at startup is /etc/httpd.conf; however, this is easily
overridden on the command line, or you can create a symbolic link
between /usr/local/WWW/cern_httpd.conf and /etc/httpd.conf. I
prefer to simply override the default, thus providing an obvious
indication as to which configuration file is currently in
use.</p><p>Upon examining listing 1 you will find a number of options
set to various values. Note that a comment line can be added to a
configuration file by using the shell script convention of placing
a # in the first column.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

# Rules
Exec    /cgi-bin/*      /usr/local/WWW/cgi-bin/*
Pass    /*              /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/*
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 1. WWW Configuration
File</b></span>
</p><p>One of the first configuration options is
<b  >ServerRoot</b>. This option determines the directory
which the server will use as the default root directory. This may
be prepended to other option settings (such as PidFile) in the case
that an absolute path is not specified. In our case, ServerRoot
should be set to /usr/local/WWW.</p><p>The HostName directive should be set to the fully qualified,
dot-separated host and domain name of the host your server will run
on. This is necessary so that the server can properly construct
references to itself. This option may also be used to specify a
hostname alias to be used in constructing URLs, as opposed to the
hostname which is returned by the system.</p><p><b  >Port</b> specifies the port the server will
accept connections on. When a client (such as Mosaic or Netscape)
retrieves a document from your server, it will contact your host at
this port to make a request. Ports provide a fixed location at
which to access a particular service on a host. Many ports have
been defined universally to be the access point for certain
services. You may examine the /etc/services file to discover some
of the ports that have been reserved on your system. If you are
setting up a WWW server which you want accessible to the general
public, you should probably use port 80. This port has been
established as the default port for providing a hypertext transport
protocol (http) service.</p><p>The <b  >PidFile</b> directive specifies the file
in which the server should log the process id of the principle
httpd server. This process id can be used to help locate the server
in the event that you want to send it a signal. The path specified
can be either an absolute path or a path relative to the
<b  >ServerRoot</b>. For example, setting
<b  >PidFile</b> to httpd-pid would cause the server to
log its process id in the file httpd-pid in the
<b  >ServerRoot</b> directory.</p><p>The next options are <b  >UserId</b> and
<b  >GroupId</b>. These options specify the user and
group ids under which the server will execute. In this article, as
pointed out earlier, I will be using www as the user and wwwgroup
as the group for the server.</p><p>Next are a set of options which control the kind of
information the server will log about access activity and errors.
<b  >AccessLog</b> and <b  >ErrorLog</b> should
be set to valid file names. These logs may be useful for providing
insight on tuning or security. You may want to keep these in
/var/log or in a directory specially created for your WWW server
logs. <b  >LogFormat</b> should be set to
<b  >Common</b>, thus indicating a logging format that is
likely to be recognized by many of the tools available to help you
process the log information. LogTime can be set to either
<b  >GMT</b> or <b  >LocalTime</b> depending on
how you want the log records time stamped.</p><p><b  >UserDir</b> specifies the name of the public
HTML document directory under each user's home directory. The
example specifies public_html as the directory the server should
support. This means that a universal resource locator (URL) of the
form http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/~<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>
is redirected to the directory
~<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>/public_html/. Each user on your
system can then create a public_html directory where they can set
up their own home pages or other publically available
documentation.</p><p>There are several <b  >Welcome</b> directives in
the example. <b  >Welcome</b> indicates which file should
be presented when a URL is passed to the server where the path
specifies only a directory. For instance, using the example
configuration file, the URL http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/docs/
would result in either Welcome.html, welcome.html, or index.html
being retrieved from directory /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/docs/ on the
server. The order that the <b  >Welcome</b> directives
appear in the configuration file determines the search order which
the server will use for finding the welcome document. Only the
first document found will be displayed.
<b  >AlwaysWelcome</b> should normally be set on. If this
option is off, the server will differentiate between URLs
specifying directories with and without a trailing /. With this
option off, a URL directory without a trailing / will result in a
directory listing being displayed instead of the welcome
document.</p><p>The <b  >Enable</b> and <b  >Disable</b>
directives specify which methods are enabled on the server. Methods
are actions that may be conducted during client-server sessions.
For instance, the <b  >GET</b> method allows documents to
be retrieved from the server while <b  >PUT</b> allows
documents to be written to the server. By default,
<b  >GET</b>, <b  >HEAD</b> and
<b  >POST</b> are enabled and <b  >DELETE</b>
and PUT are disabled. I prefer to explicitly define the methods so
as to clearly control the accesses that I wish to allow. It is
usually best not to allow destructive methods, such as
<b  >PUT</b> or <b  >DELETE</b>, since it is
possible to accidentally allow insecure accesses to the server
which may provide a method for an intruder to enter your
system.</p><p>The last section of our example configuration file deals with
rules. Rules are used to control the processing of URLs which are
passed to the server. These rules may map URL strings to specific
files or operations. In the example file, two rules are included to
simplify URL construction and to specify an executable path for the
CGI programs and scripts. The first rule is an
<b  >Exec</b>. This rule tells the server that URLs which
contain the string <b  >/cgi-bin/</b> are to result in
the execution of a CGI program or script in the physical directory
/usr/local/WWW/cgi-bin/. <b  >Pass</b> indicates a rule
which causes all URLs starting with the string /to be mapped to the
directory /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/. This is the directory where you
should place your server's public HTML documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfba60"></a>The Default Welcome Document</h2></div></div><p>You will probably want to have a default document that will
be displayed when a client accesses your server without specifying
a particular document. For instance, a client might connect to your
server using a URL of the form http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/. If
there is no default welcome document, a file listing of the
directory as specified by the <b  >Pass</b> directive
will be displayed. A client may then access any documents in this
directory with the correct permissions. Also, keep in mind that if
a document is in the htdocs directory, a client can access it by
explicitly naming that file in a URL. Only documents which you want
made public should be here.</p><p>To create a default welcome page for your server, you need
simply create a welcome document in the directory
/usr/local/WWW/htdocs using one of the file names you specified in
the server configuration file with a <b  >Welcome</b>
directive. To set up a simple default welcome document create the
file /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/Welcome.html containing the following
text and set the file permissions to be world readable
(<b  >chmod a+r</b>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;TITLE&gt;Welcome!&lt;/TITLE&gt;
Welcome to my WWW server!
</pre><p>This will display a document with the title Welcome! and a
simple welcome message displayed in the body. Later, you will
probably want to add more interesting information to this file,
along with links to other documents that your server
provides.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfbd78"></a>Testing and Startup</h2></div></div><p>Now the server is ready for an initial test run. You will
first want to start up the server in verbose mode from a terminal
connection so that you can check for any configuration errors. From
a terminal, enter the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/WWW/httpd -v -r /usr/local/WWW/config/cern_httpd.conf &amp;
</pre><p>The <b  >-v</b> flag indicates that server should
run in verbose mode, and the <b  >-r</b> flag specifies
the server configuration file. The server will print a number of
initialization messages and messages about any configuration errors
it encounters as it starts. Check these messages for errors or
discrepancies. Once the server has completed its start-up
processing, you can use your favorite WWW browser to connect to it
using an URL of the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/
</pre><p>If all goes well, you should see the message from the default
welcome document. Be sure to examine the output of the server for
any errors, and correct them as necessary.</p><p>The server can be started from one of your rc scripts
(probably rc.local or rc.inet2) when the system is booted. It
should be started after the network is initialized. A good place to
start the daemon is in the same rc script used to start sendmail or
inetd. The following entry can be used to start the httpd server
daemon and to warn you if it cannot be started:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Start the CERN httpd server
if [ -x /usr/local/WWW/httpd ]; then
          echo -n ", httpd"
          /usr/local/WWW/httpd -r /usr/local/WWW/config/cern_httpd.conf &amp;
else
          echo
          echo "=================="
          echo " httpd not found. "
          echo "=================="
fi
</pre><p>This is a standalone startup of the daemon. You can also
start the server using inetd, but you will get better response from
a standalone startup. Proper configuration of inetd is outside of
the scope of this article. If you wish to use inetd, please refer
to the man pages and documentation on inetd and the relevant
section of CERN's documentation available at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Installation/Inetd.html" target="_self">www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Installation/Inetd.html</a>.
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> was also documented in the
System Administration column in issue 12 of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfc2a0"></a>Controlling the Daemon</h2></div></div><p>The httpd daemon accepts various types of signals. Two of
these are most notable. A KILL signal will cause the daemon to
terminate, and can be issued with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kill -KILL `cat /usr/local/WWW/httpd-pid`
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -KILL httpd
</pre><p>Sometimes you may want to reconfigure the daemon without
shutting it down. This can be done by changing the configuration
files then issuing a HUP signal to the daemon as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kill -HUP `cat /usr/local/WWW/httpd-pid`
</pre><p>or</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -HUP httpd
</pre><p>As always, be sure to check the error log for any possible
configuration errors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfc668"></a>User's Home Pages</h2></div></div><p>For a user to create a home page, the subdirectory specified
by the UserDir directive in the configuration file (public_html in
the example) must be created in the user's home directory. The user
should place all publically available documents under this
directory. The user may want to create a welcome page for
presentation when the server resolves URLs of the form
http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/~joe. The server will attempt to
resolve a URL of this form to reference a welcome document in the
public_html directory. If a welcome document is not found, a
directory listing will be presented to the client instead.</p><p>For the server to properly access a user's home pages, the
permissions on the user's home directory must be set to allow the
server to <span   class="emphasis"><em>read through</em></span> the home directory into
the public_html subdirectory. This can be done by setting the
user's home directory so that it has world execute permissions
(<b  >chmod a+x</b>). The public_html directory must be
set to allow world read and execute (<b  >chmod
a+rx</b>). Finally, the documents in the public_html
directory should have permissions which allow world reading
(<b  >chmod a+r</b>).</p><p>An alternative to having users home pages in subdirectories
of their home directories is to create a special directory tree
under /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/. This directory tree will typically
have a subdirectory for each user who will be creating public
documents accessible via the httpd daemon. With this arrangement
special permissions need not be set on users' home directories,
maintaining some additional security. If this method is
implemented, the <b  >UserDir</b> directive shown in the
example should probably be omitted. This will disable the support
of URLs of the form
http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/~<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>.</p><p>For example, you could create a /usr/local/WWW/htdocs/home/
directory. Under this directory you could create a subdirectory for
each user who will be creating public documents. If the user is to
be able to freely modify the directory contents, the ownership and
permissions must be set accordingly. The permissions must also be
set to allow the server to access this directory. This usually
means making the directory world readable (<b  >chmod
a+r</b>). A user's home page can then be accessed using a URL
such as http://wwwhost.my.domain.name/home/joe/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1809580.0x1cfcae0"></a>You Have Just Begun...</h2></div></div><p>What has been presented here has been designed to get a basic
server up and running. Many topics are left out, including proxy
support and special access control. The CERN httpd daemon is a very
flexible and configurable WWW server. For further research you will
