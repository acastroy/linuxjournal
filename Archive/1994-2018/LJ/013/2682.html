released Linux 1.2.0, also called &ldquo;Linux '95&rdquo;, little less than a
year after his release of the ground-breaking Linux 1.0. In his
announcement, Linus pointed out an important difference&mdash;the
license&mdash;between the two operating systems, with an elaborate spoof
on Microsoft's license explanation. Here's a short sample from
Linus's spoof:
</p><p>Linux '95 has several types of licenses, including, but not
limited to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>End-User License Agreement&mdash;Applications:This is an
application-specific license, which is intended for a single
application running on your Linux '95-authorized computer. The
license agreement rules differ depending on the application. See
appendix `H'.</p></li><li><p>End-User License Agreement&mdash;Systems:This agreement
is intended for single system product use, such as the Linux '95
kernel license. It's important to note that the Systems product
licenses do not permit concurrent, or second copies. There is a
special Multi-License upgrade program for those that want to start
out with a single license but later expand their setup.</p></li><li><p>Multi-License Pak:This agreement is intended for
sites with multiple systems, which want to run multiple copies of
the Linux '95 system concurrently and/or on several machines. This
license is available as a 10, 50 or 100-unit license depending on
the size of your installation.</p></li><li><p>[...]</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;I've got too much money&rdquo; License: Contact us
for details on this exclusive licensing deal, we'll work something
out. Please contact &ldquo;ivemoney@linux.Helsinki.FI&rdquo; directly.</p></li></ul></div><p>Large institutions that want to possibly combine several
licenses can do so with a standard licensing fee reduction. Please
contact our licensing department for further details.
</p><p>[...]</p><p>We thank you for using Linux '95,</p><p>Linus
</p><p>Of course, Linux 1.2 is still freely available under the GNU
public license, just as Linux 1.0 was, and just as future versions
will continue to be, and so all the licensing fees mentioned above
are $0 per copy...except maybe the &ldquo;I've got too much money&rdquo;
license.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2682f1.jpg"></div><p>Figure</p><p>Here is a list of a few of the new features that version 1.2
has, compared to version 1.0:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Highly improved networking.</p></li><li><p>Faster disk I/O.</p></li><li><p>EIDE, multiple-IDE controllers, and ATA-CD-ROM
support.</p></li><li><p>Supports more kinds of floppies, including 2.88
MB.</p></li><li><p>More CD-ROM devices supported.</p></li><li><p>Improved SCSI support, support for new SCSI adapter
drivers.</p></li><li><p>Support for more network adapters.</p></li><li><p>New, improved memory management.</p></li><li><p>Multi-platform support underway.</p></li><li><p>UMSDOS filesystem: install Linux on DOS
filesystem.</p></li><li><p>New sound driver supports Linux DOOM</p></li><li><p>Much, much more.</p></li></ul></div><p>Most Linux vendors are expected to release new versions of
their distributions containing Linux 1.2 soon.</p><p>If you have Internet access, you can download the source code
for the new kernel via ftp from ftp.funet.fi, in the directory
/pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/v1.2/. Version 1.2.0 is in the file
linux-1.2.0.tar.gz; by the time you read this, it is likely that a
few bug fixes will have been released, so look for the newest
version there. If you do not have internet access, a local BBS may
have the source code, and any one of the vendors advertising in
<i  >Linux Journal</i> will be happy to sell you a CD-ROM with the source
included as soon as they have them available.</p><p>Linus has indicated that further testing, and bug fixing as
necessary, will be done for approximately another month, leading to
an even more stable Linux 1.2.x release. He has indicated that he
will probably begin work on a new development series, Linux 1.3.x,
sometime in early April.</p><p>Some utilities will need to be upgraded if you upgrade from
Linux 1.0 to Linux 1.2, including networking utilities like
ifconfig. The update program and the module utilities will also
need to be updated. An article in the next issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> will cover the process of updating from 1.0 to
1.2 in detail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a60580.0x1b595d8"></a>What Does 1.2.x Mean?</h2></div></div><p>Since Linux version 1.0 was released, the version number has
been used to distinguish between &ldquo;production&rdquo; or &ldquo;stable&rdquo; releases
of Linux and &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; or &ldquo;development&rdquo; versions. Each version
number has three parts: the major release number, the minor release
number, and the patchlevel. Version 1.1.95, is major version 1,
minor version 1, patchlevel 95. Version 1.2.0 is major version 1,
minor version 2, patchlevel 0. All version numbers with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>even</em></span> minor version numbers are considered
production versions, and official patches to production versions
only include bug fixes, so for instance, between version 1.0.0 and
1.0.9 there were only bug fixes. All version numbers with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>odd</em></span> minor version numbers are development
versions, which (although they usually work fine) are not expected
to be stable&mdash;all sorts of changes might have happened during their
development.</p><p>Linux 1.2 is the second production release of Linux, and
follows the first production release, Linux 1.0, by just under a
year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a60580.0x1b597e8"></a>What Is Left to Do?</h2></div></div><p>Linus and others are working on support for multiple
platforms, including DEC's Alpha, Sun's Sparc, MIPS' R3000 and
R4000 series, and IBM and Motorola's PowerPC. Support for Amigas
and Ataris with the Motorola 680x0 CPU has become relatively stable
recently, and work is progressing on merging that work into the
standard development kernel. DEC has funded a small team of
programmers to work on porting Linux to the Alpha, and has loaned
an Alpha machine to Linus. They are working in parallel. The DEC
team has already released a 32-bit version of Linux that can run
some programs, and Linus has released a 64-bit version that can run
some Alpha OSF/1 binaries, and has successfully run GNU
Bash.</p><p>Many Linux developers have been working behind the scenes on
more performance enhancements and additional functionality that
they would like to add to Linux 1.3.x. Linus has indicated that
disk-space quotas, considered essential by many people who use
Linux to run public-access systems, will probably be added during
1.3.x development. Further improvements to networking are being
designed by Alan Cox, the main networking developer. Donald Becker,
the developer of most of the Linux ethernet drivers, is working on
some 100MB/s ethernet drivers that are likely to be added to 1.3.x.
Work on wide SCSI support has already been started. More
&ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; (or co-processing) serial adaptor drivers will be
added. New hardware devices are being added all the time, and it is
reasonable to expect that quite a few new supported devices will be
added during 1.3.x development.</p><p>Not necessarily in version 1.3.x, but at some point in the
not-yet-determined future, Linus has mentioned support for systems
with multiple CPU's, such as the dual Pentiums being sold by many
vendors now.</p><p>Of course, all the exact predictions here are the predictions
of the author, and should be &ldquo;taken with a grain of salt&rdquo;. We can
expect that the Linux developers have more nice surprises in store
for us, some of which they haven't yet thought of.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a60580.0x1b599f8"></a>In Mostly Unrelated News...</h2></div></div><p>The Linux dosemu development team reported that their current
development version of dosemu (runs DOS, and DOS programs, from
within Linux) runs the 32-bit Borland C/C++ compilers. They also
report being able to run several 32-bit DOS-only games that they
had been told would be impossible to run in dosemu. The list of
games posted included: DOOM, DOOM2, Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 2,
OMF 2097, Raptor, Wacky Wheels, and Rise of the Triad. (Note that
Id software has also made native versions of Doom available for
Linux.) Of course, common DOS applications like WordPerfect still
run, too.</p><p>The team intends to have a public release of dosemu ready
within a month or so; hopefully dosemu 0.60 will be available for
ftp from tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/ALPHA/dosemu/ by the time you
read this. They are currently looking for volunteers to help them
write documentation, and they will probably still be looking for
volunteers to help with this large task by the time you read this;
if you are interested, download dosemu and contact the team leader,
