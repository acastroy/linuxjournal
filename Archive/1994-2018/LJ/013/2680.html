programs from several textbooks, pre-built search indexes for tools
such as Glimpse, LQ-Text, viewers for PostScript and PDF, and other
goodies. Also included is the full source code for two complete
window systems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The X Window System, Version 11, Release 6, (latest
patch Level 11), including XFree86 (3.1.1.), and</p></li><li><p>The MGR Window System by Steve Uhler of
Bellcore.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to the textbooks, tool, and source code, there is
an online &ldquo;tour&rdquo; of OPEN LOOK, XView, and other parts of the
CD-ROM. The Tour is written in validated HTML, usable with Mosaic,
Netscape, TkWWW, or your favorite Web viewer. If you are on the
Internet, you can follow links to the outside. HTML hyperlinks are
provided to the original FTP sources for much of the free software
