    If you program for Linux, you do need to understand
    licensing, no matter if you are writing free software or
    commercial software. Here's a road map.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x19c05b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>How often do you see on Usenet a sentence
like &ldquo;DISCLAIMER: I am not a lawyer, and I am not qualified to
give legal advice ?&rdquo; Perhaps one day tort reform will be passed
and non-lawyers won't have to make a disclaimer like this in order
to avoid being sued. Until then, I need to make the same
disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. I don't even play one on T.V. What
you read here is my interpretation of these licenses, and while I
have done my best not to err, to err is human. Before betting your
life, your fortune, or your sacred honor on my interpretation you
should read them yourselves, come to your own understanding of
them, and if you are not comfortable <span   class="bold"><b>ask a
lawyer</b></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x19c0710"></a>Licensing versus Copyrighting</h2></div></div><p>The first thing you need to understand is the difference
between copyright and license. A copyright safeguards the ownership
of an intellectual property. If you hold
<span   class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span> to some intellectual property, you
have several rights regarding that property, and you can assign
(sell or give) some or all of those rights to others. A
<span   class="emphasis"><em>License</em></span>, on the other hand, is a document lets
someone use your intellectual property.</p><p>For example, the GNU General Public License (GPL), which is
often incorrectly called a &ldquo;copyright,&rdquo; is a license. Applying
the GPL to code to which <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> own the copyright
does not assign the copyright to the Free Software Foundation (FSF,
the authors of the GPL). You still own the copyright&mdash;applying the
GPL to your code merely lets other people modify and redistribute
your code in accordance with the GPL's terms. The GPL is too long
to include in this article; you can use FTP to retrieve a copy from
the canonical site, prep.ai.mit.edu, in the /pub/gnu
directory.</p><p>The GPL is one of the most popular licenses in the Linux
world; the MIT X and BSD licenses are also popular. The MIT license
is very permissive: it says (like all software licenses of which I
am aware) that no warranty is provided, that the copyright notices
must be maintained, and that MIT's name (or with similar licenses,
the name of the copyright holder) cannot be used in advertising or
publicity without written permission. The BSD license, by contrast,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>requires</em></span> that all advertising materials
display an acknowledgment of &ldquo;the University of California,
Berkeley and its contributors,&rdquo; while prohibiting using either
name as an <span   class="emphasis"><em>endorsement</em></span>. In other respects, it
is much like the MIT license. If you can't figure out how to
acknowledge MIT and BSD without using them, talk to a lawyer. The
<a href="1297s2.html" target="_self">MIT</a> and
<a href="1297s1.html" target="_self">BSD</a> licenses are short enough to
reprint in this article&mdash;see the sidebars.</p><p>Let's say you wish to develop <span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>
software derived from software that is licensed under the terms of
any one of these agreements. All you have to do is maintain the
current copyrights and insert your copyright notice for the code
you add, thereby licensing your additions under the same license as
the rest of the code.</p><p>However, if you wish to develop
<span   class="emphasis"><em>commercial</em></span> software derived from free
software, there are thornier issues. The MIT and BSD licenses do
not require you to release your source code. You must simply follow
the terms of the license, which mostly have to do with maintaining
copyright notices and following limitations about advertising and
promotion. If the original software is licensed under the GPL,
however, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> release your source code in
compliance with the GPL in order for you to distribute the derived
work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x19c0ce8"></a>Licensing when Developing under Linux</h2></div></div><p>The biggest single concern shared by software developers new
to Linux is that because Linux is subject to the GPL, any software
written or compiled under Linux is also subject to the GPL.
Fortunately, this concern is groundless. Plenty of commercial
software is available for Linux, and it does not violate the GPL in
any way. Developing and compiling your software on a Linux system
does not cause your software to be <span   class="emphasis"><em>derived</em></span>
from the GPL-licensed Linux source code.</p><p>Some people assume that because they use
<b  >#include</b> to include system header files in their
application, their application is suddenly considered to be
&ldquo;derived from&rdquo; those header files. This is not the case; the
declarations in header files are legally considered &ldquo;public
interfaces&rdquo; and cannot be copyrighted. This is the same as any
other development platform: the header files on every commercial
platform sport copyright notices that assert ownership over the
header files, but that doesn't mean your application was derived
from those header files.</p><p>Some people also assume that if they compile their program
with the GNU C compiler (gcc), their program must be licensed under
the terms of the GPL. This is not true. The GPL states that &ldquo;the
output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute
a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).&rdquo; Many commercial software vendors compile
their products exclusively with GCC; some Unix systems are shipped
from the vendor with GCC as the standard system compiler. They are
not in violation of the GPL.</p><p>You do need to be careful, however, when linking with
libraries that are licensed under a slightly relaxed version of the
GPL called the GNU Library General Public License, or LGPL. Linux's
standard C library, and most of its other libraries, are licensed
under these terms, which require you (read the license for further
details) to do <span   class="bold"><b>one</b></span> of the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Link dynamically.</p></li><li><p>Provide object files that can be linked to static
libraries.</p></li><li><p>Provide source code.</p></li></ul></div><p>The second option isn't very easy to implement, and the third
option, while great for freely redistributable software, is less
than ideal for more restricted commercial software vendors. The
right answer for <span   class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span>, whether the
software is free or not, is to link dynamically. This provides
several advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Your program uses less system memory when
running.</p></li><li><p>Allows your program to be upgraded automatically
when bugs are found in the library.</p></li><li><p>Creates smaller binaries.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since dynamic linking is the default on all normal Unix
platforms, using it on Linux platforms is not likely to be a
hardship.</p><p>Note that this restriction applies only to libraries licensed
under the LGPL. Commercial libraries such as the Motif libraries
are not affected by this condition, nor are libraries that are
licensed under the BSD or MIT terms. Since there is rarely any
reason to link statically, you can almost always ignore this issue.
You need only worry about it if you want to distribute a program
that is staticly linked against an LGPL-licensed library
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> you do not wish to distribute the source
code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x19c1688"></a>Caution</h2></div></div><p>There are a few things that you can do that are incompatible
with using the GPL. First of all, you can't derive a work from code
licensed both under the GPL and the BSD license. This is because
the GPL forbids imposing any restrictions beyond those imposed by
the GPL, and the BSD license imposes the additional restriction
that UCB and its contributors be acknowledged in
advertisement.</p><p>Also, non-disclosure agreements (NDA) that prohibit you from
releasing source code developed under the terms of the agreement
are blatantly incompatible with using the GPL. If you sign an NDA
that doesn't allow you to distribute source code, and then write
code for a GPL application under the terms of the NDA, you can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> your modified version of the GPL
application (remember that the GPL doesn't restrict use in any
way), but you cannot redistribute it.</p><p>Similarly, if your code uses a software patent, the patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use, or you cannot
redistribute your modified version of the application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x19c1898"></a>Licensing and the Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The Linux kernel is licensed under the GPL. This means that
if you write code linked into the Linux kernel, and want to
distribute it, the code <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be licensed under
the GPL. For example, you are not allowed to distribute the driver
for a new hardware device as an object file that needs to be linked
into the kernel at compile time. To do so would beg a lawsuit
brought by everyone who holds copyright to some part of the Linux
kernel.</p><p>It <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> possible, however, to distribute a
driver in binary form only, under any licensing terms you wish, as
a kernel loadable module. The kernel provides a public interface to
which object modules can be bound at run time. The key words here
are <span   class="emphasis"><em>public interface</em></span>. A public interface
cannot be copyrighted. The declarations in a C header file and the
system call interface are also examples of public interfaces, that
are also not copyright-able. You can safely think of the
kernel-loadable module interface as &ldquo;system calls for code running
with kernel privileges in kernel space&rdquo;.</p><p>However, it is usually not advisable to distribute
binary-only kernel loadable modules, for a variety of
reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The public interface is subject to change at any
time and is frequently changed.</p></li><li><p>It violates the spirit of the GPL that has made
Linux a success by taking away users' freedom to support
themselves, and some users or potential users may become vocal
about losing that freedom.</p></li><li><p>Linux developers will not notify you of changes in
the interface; you need to be proactive in discovering changes by
&ldquo;joining the kernel-of-the-day club&rdquo; (downloading, compiling, and
running the latest kernel every time a new development kernel is
released) or you will get complaints from users that your software
suddenly broke.</p></li></ul></div><p>Maintaining a binary-only product based on a kernel-loadable
module is definitely possible but doing this does take extra work,
and if you don't account for the work beforehand, you may be
unhappy when you need to take the time. To say this another way:
most commercial software development on Linux raises no more issues
than are raised on any other platform, but binary-only kernel
modules <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> raise other issues that you would
need to consider.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x1dba0c0"></a>Licensing Tricks</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes people want their code to be licensed under terms
that are compatible with both the GPL and the BSD licenses. There
are three ways to do this.</p><p>The first involves the <span   class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span> instead
of the license. You can donate the copyright to the public domain
which gives intellectual ownership to everyone in the world,
individually and collectively. Anyone can do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> at all with the code, with no
restrictions whatsoever. Since they <span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> the
code, they don't need a license to use it.</p><p>The second involves writing a very permissive license that
allows anyone to use the code for almost any purpose. As long as
you don't add any restrictions that aren't in the GPL, and as long
as you don't prevent other people from adding restrictions, code
protected by this form of licensing can be used for projects that
use the GPL or the BSD license, without legal problems. If you
choose to write your own license, be <span   class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> to
get legal help in doing so. There are many licenses written by
laymen that are legal nonsense, and if you want to have any chance
of being able to enforce your license, get a legal opinion. Also,
get a legal opinion if you do want other people to be able to use
your code, since without a license, it is illegal to use code you
don't own. anyone concerned about lawsuits won't be able to use
your code if it is licensed under non-enforceable terms, even if
you have personally decided you would never sue anyone over use of
the code.</p><p>Perhaps the best option, however, is this: as the copyright
owner, you can license your code to anyone you like under any
license you like. You don't have to offer only one set of license
terms. You can offer users the choice between, say, the GPL license
terms and the BSD license terms. For example, a set of libraries
called PAM is being developed which will need to be linked both
with GPL applications and BSD applications. Its license first gives
the BSD license terms (modified not to mention UCB, since UCB isn't
involved in its development), and then says, &ldquo;ALTERNATIVELY, this
product may be distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License, in which case the provisions of the GPL are
required INSTEAD OF the above restrictions.&rdquo; Some code in the
Linux kernel has been licensed in this way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x1dba430"></a>Shareware Licensing</h2></div></div><p>Shareware hasn't really caught on in the Linux world. Perhaps
because so much quality software is available without any sort of
payment, and perhaps because Linux grows out of the movement to
write free software for Unix and predates the shareware movement,
there are only a few popular shareware packages in the Linux world.
Most of these provide for <span   class="emphasis"><em>optional</em></span> payment for
personal use, and required payment only for business or commercial
use. There are no <span   class="emphasis"><em>legal</em></span> restrictions that keep
you from releasing shareware for Linux, but be aware that you are
entering relatively uncharted waters if you choose to license a
Linux application as shareware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c8580.0x1dba5e8"></a>It's Not That Hard</h2></div></div><p>The most important thing to remember is that licensing isn't
a particularly complicated issue in most cases. This entire article
has been concerned mostly with exceptional cases. Most normal
application vendors and most free software authors will have no
licensing issues to resolve. Just be aware of the differences
between licensing techniques, so that you will be aware of the
issues involved. if you ever do have a problem to resolve.</p></div></div>
