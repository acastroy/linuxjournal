    It's worth making
    friends with a good C debugger.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10bf500"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are many reasons you might need a
debugger&mdash;the most obvious being that you're a programmer and
you've written an application that doesn't work right. Beyond this,
Linux depends heavily both on sharing source code and on porting
code from other Unix systems. For both types of code, you may turn
up problems that the original authors didn't have on their
platform. So it's worth making friends with a good C debugger.
</p><p>Luckily, the Free Software Foundation has come through with
an excellent debugger named <span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>,
which works with both C and C++ code. gdb lets you stop execution
within the program, examine and change variables during execution,
and trace how the program executes. It also has command line
editing and history features similar to those used with
<span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> (the GNU shell) and Emacs. In
fact, it now has a graphical interface. But since we've grown up
using the command-line interface (and it's easier to show in print)
we'll stick to that in this article.</p><p>To get full documentation on all gdb commands, read the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Debugging with gdb</em></span> manual on-line or order it
from the Free Software Foundation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10bf7c0"></a>Compilation for gdb</h2></div></div><p>Before you can use gdb to debug a program, compile and link
your code with the <b  >-g</b> option. This causes the
compiler to generate an augmented symbol table. For example, the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ <span   class="bold"><b>gcc -g file1.c file2.c file3.o</b></span>
</pre><p>compiles the C source files file1.c and file2.c, generating
an expanded symbol table for use with gdb. These files are linked
with file3.o, an object file that has already been compiled.</p><p>The compiler's <b  >-g</b> and
<b  >-O</b> are not incompatible; you can optimize and
compile for debugging at the same time. Furthermore, unlike many
other debuggers, gdb will even give you somewhat intelligible
results. However, debugging optimized code is difficult since, by
nature, optimization makes the machine code diverge from what the
source code says to do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10bfb30"></a>Starting gdb</h2></div></div><p>To debug a compiled program with gdb, use the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ <span   class="bold"><b>gdb </b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span> [ <span   class="emphasis"><em>core-dump</em></span> ]
</pre><p>where <b  ><i><tt>program</tt></i></b>
is the filename of the executable file you want to debug, and
<b  ><i><tt>core-dump</tt></i></b> is the name
of a core dump file left from an earlier attempt to run your
program. By examining the core dump with gdb, you can discover
where the program failed and the reason for its failure. For
example, the following command tells gdb to read the executable
file qsort2 and the core dump core.2957:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ <span   class="bold"><b>gdb qsort2 core.2957</b></span>

$
</pre><p>The startup is fairly verbose; it tells you which version of
gdb you're using. Then it tells you how the core file was generated
(by the program <span   class="bold"><b>qsort2</b></span>, which
received signal 7, an &ldquo;emulator trap&rdquo;), and what the program was
doing (executing line 118). The prompt &ldquo;(gdb)&rdquo; tells you that gdb
is ready for a command. In this case, we'll just quit.</p><p>Both the executable file and the core file arguments are
optional. You can supply a core file at a later date with the
<span   class="bold"><b>core</b></span> command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10c01b8"></a>Basic gdb Commands</h2></div></div><p>With just a few commands, you can get most of your work done
in gdb. The basic things you have to do are: look at your source
code, set breakpoints, run programs, and check variables.</p><p>If you forget which command to use (or want to check for
obscure features) use the built-in help facility. You can request a
particular command (like <b  >help print</b>) or on a
number of special topics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10c0370"></a>Listing a File</h2></div></div><p>To see the contents of the source file from which the
executable program was compiled, use the command

</pre><p>To print specific lines from the file you are currently

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10c0948"></a>Executing a Program</h2></div></div><p>To run the program you are debugging, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>run</b></span> command. This may be followed
by any arguments you want to pass to the program, including the
standard input and output specifiers &lt; and &gt;, and shell
wildcards (<b  >*</b>, <b  >?</b>,
<b  >[</b>, <b  >]</b>). You can't use C-shell
history (<b  >!</b>) or pipes
(<b  >|</b>).</p><p>For example, consider running the program
<span   class="bold"><b>exp</b></span> through gdb. The following gdb
command runs exp with the argument <b  >-b</b>, taking
the standard input to exp from <span   class="emphasis"><em>invalues</em></span> and
redirecting standard output to the file
<span   class="emphasis"><em>outtable</em></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ <span   class="bold"><b>gdb exp</b></span>
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>run -b &lt; invalues &gt; outtable</b></span>
</pre><p>That is, this command runs <b  >exp -b &lt;
<i><tt>invalues</tt></i> &gt;
<i><tt>outtable</tt></i></b>. If you have not set
any breakpoints or used any other gdb debugging features, exp will
run until it terminates, either correctly or incorrectly.</p><p>If the program you're debugging terminates abnormally,
control returns to gdb. You can then use gdb commands to find out
why the program terminated. The
<span   class="bold"><b>backtrace</b></span> command gives a stack
backtrace showing exactly what the program was doing when it bombed
out:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ <span   class="bold"><b>gdb badref</b></span>

</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>backtrace</b></span> (which is usually
abbreviated <span   class="bold"><b>back</b></span>) produces a list
of all active procedures and the arguments with which they were
called, starting with the most recent. So this display shows that
the program died in a function named
<b  >march_to_infinity()</b>; this function was called by
the function <b  >setup()</b>, which in turn was called
by the function <b  >main()</b>. The only thing left is
to figure out exactly what wrong in
<b  >march_to_infinity()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10b7de0"></a>Printing Data</h2></div></div><p>You can inspect the variable values by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> command. Let's use it to see
exactly what happened in the previous program. First, we'll list
some code to see what we're dealing with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>list</b></span>

9            p=&amp;j;

14                p++;
15           }
16      printf("h: %d\en",h);
17
</pre><p>It should already be pretty clear what's happening.
<b  >p</b> is some kind of a pointer; we can test that by
using the <span   class="bold"><b>whatis</b></span> command, which
shows us its declaration:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>whatis p</b></span>
type = int *
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>print p</b></span>
$1 = (int *) 0xf8000000
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>print *p</b></span>
$2 = Cannot access memory at address 0xf8000000.
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>print h</b></span>
$3 = -1
(gdb)
</pre><p>When we look at <b  >p</b>, we see that it's
pointing somewhere up in the stratosphere. Of course, there's no
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ad hoc</em></span> way to know whether this value for
<b  >p</b> is legitimate or not. But we can see if we can
read the the data <b  >p</b> points to, just as our
program did&mdash;and when we give the command <b  >print
*p</b>, we see that it's pointing to inaccessible
data.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> is one of gdb's true
power features. You can use it to print the value of any expression
that's valid in the language you're debugging. In additions to
variables from your program, expressions may include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Calls to functions within your program; these
function calls may have &ldquo;side-effects&rdquo; (i.e., they can do things
like modify global variables that will be visible when you continue
program execution).</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x10b8888"></a>Breakpoints</h2></div></div><p>Breakpoints let you stop a program temporarily while it is
executing. While the program is stopped at a breakpoint, you can
examine or modify variables, execute functions, or execute any
other gdb command. This lets you examine the program's state to
determine whether execution is proceeding correctly. You can then
resume program execution at the point where it left off.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>break</b></span> command (which you
can abbreviate to <span   class="bold"><b>b</b></span>) sets
breakpoints in the program you are debugging. This command has the
following forms:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  ><i><tt>break</tt></i>
<i><tt>line-number</tt></i></b></span></dt><dd><p>Stop the program just before executing the given
line.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  ><i><tt>break</tt></i>
<i><tt>function-name</tt></i></b></span></dt><dd><p>Stop the program just before entering the named
function.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  ><i><tt>break</tt></i>
<i><tt>line-or-function</tt></i>
<i><tt>if</tt></i>
<i><tt>condition</tt></i></b></span></dt><dd><p>Stop the program if the following
<b  ><i><tt>condition</tt></i></b> is true
when the program reaches the given line or function.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The command <b  >break
<i><tt>function-name</tt></i></b> sets a
breakpoint at the entrance to the specified function. When the
program is executing, gdb will temporarily halt the program at the
first executable line of the given function. For example, the
<span   class="bold"><b>break</b></span> command below sets a
breakpoint at the entrance to the function
<b  >init_random()</b>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>run</b></span> command then executes the
program until it reaches the beginning of this function. Execution
stops at the first executable line within
<b  >init_random()</b>, which is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> loop beginning on line 155 of the source
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

identification number (in this case, 1) and prints some essential
information about the breakpoint. Whenever it reaches a breakpoint,
gdb prints the breakpoint's identification number, the description,
and the current line number. If you have several breakpoints set in
the program, the identification number tells you which one caused
the program to stop. gdb then shows you the line at which at which
the program has stopped.</p><p>To stop execution when the program reaches a particular
source line, use the <b  >break

</pre><p>Execution will continue until the program ends, you reach
another breakpoint, or an error occurs.</p><p>gdb supports another kind of breakpoint, called a
&ldquo;watchpoint&rdquo;. Watchpoints are sort of like the &ldquo;break-if&rdquo;
breakpoints we just discussed, except they aren't attached to a
particular line or function entry. A watchpoint stops the program
whenever an expression is true: for example, the command below
stops the program whenever the variable <b  >testsize</b>
is greater than 100000.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <b  >watch testsize &gt; 100000</b>
</pre><p>Watchpoints are a great idea, but they're hard to use
effectively. They're exactly what you want if something is randomly
trashing an important variable, and you can't figure out what: the
program bombs out, you discover that
<b  ><i><tt>mungus</tt></i></b> is set to some
screwy value, but you know that the code that's supposed to set
<b  ><i><tt>mungus</tt></i></b> works; it's
clearly being corrupted by something else. The problem is that
without special hardware support (which exists on only a few
workstations), setting a watchpoint slows your program down by a
factor of 100 or so. Therefore, if you're really desperate, you can
use regular breakpoints to get your program as close as possible to
the point of failure; set a watchpoint; let the program continue
execution with the <span   class="bold"><b>continue</b></span>
command; and let your program cook overnight.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x13cd638"></a>Single-step Execution</h2></div></div><p>gdb provides two forms of single-step execution. The
<span   class="bold"><b>next</b></span> command executes an entire
function when it encounters a call, while the
<span   class="bold"><b>step</b></span> command enters the function
and keeps going one statement at a time. To understand the
difference between these two commands, look at their behavior in
the context of debugging a simple program. Consider the following
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

executing at line 79, rather than 46. Rather than executing
<b  >gen_and_sort()</b> in its entirety, it stepped
&ldquo;into&rdquo; the function. In contrast,
<span   class="bold"><b>next</b></span> would execute line 46
entirely, including the call to

you are in the program; their arguments and output depend on the
current frame. Usually, the current frame is the function where you
are stopped. Occasionally, however, you want to change this default
so you can do something like display a number of variables from
another function.</p><p>The commands <span   class="bold"><b>up</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>down</b></span> move you up and down one

<span   class="bold"><b>down </b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> move
you up or down <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> levels in the stack. Down the
stack means farther away from the program's
<b  >main()</b> function; up means closer to
<b  >main()</b>. By using
<span   class="bold"><b>up</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>down</b></span>, you can investigate local
variables in any function that's on the stack, including recursive
invocations. Naturally, you can't move down until you've moved up
first&mdash;by default you're in the currently executing function, which
is as far down in the stack as you can go.</p><p>For example, in <b  >qsort2()</b>,
<b  >main()</b> calls <b  >gen_and_sort()</b>,

<b  >gen_and_sort()</b>; the command
<span   class="bold"><b>down</b></span> moves you back towards
<b  >swap()</b>. If you forget where you are, the command
<span   class="bold"><b>frame</b></span> summarizes the current stack
frame:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>frame</b></span>
#1  0x278c in qsort2 (l=0, u=9, strat=1) at
qsort2.c:121
121                    swap(i,j);
</pre><p>In this case, it shows that we're looking at the stack frame
for <b  >qsort2()</b>, and currently executing the call
to the function <b  >swap()</b>. This should be no
surprise, since we already now that we're stopped at a breakpoint
in <b  >swap</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x13ceb30"></a>Machine Language Facilities</h2></div></div><p>gdb provides a few special commands for working with machine
language. First, the <span   class="bold"><b>info line</b></span>
command is used to tell you where the object code for a specific
line of source code begins and ends. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>info line 121</b></span>
Line 121 of "qsort2.c" starts at pc 0x277c and
ends at 0x278c.
</pre><p>You can then use the
<span   class="bold"><b>disassemble</b></span> command to discover
the machine code for this line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>disassemble 0x260c 0x261c</b></span>
Dump of assembler code from 0x260c to 0x261c:
0x260c &lt;qsort2&gt;:        save  %sp, -120, %sp
0x2610 &lt;qsort2+4&gt;:      st  %i0, [ %fp + 0x44 ]
0x2614 &lt;qsort2+8&gt;:      st  %i1, [ %fp + 0x48 ]
0x2618 &lt;qsort2+12&gt;:     st  %i2, [ %fp + 0x4c ]
End of assembler dump.
</pre><p>The commands <span   class="bold"><b>stepi</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>nexti</b></span> are equivalent to
<span   class="bold"><b>step</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>next</b></span> but work on the level of
machine language instructions rather than source statements. The
<span   class="bold"><b>stepi</b></span> command executes the next
machine language instruction. The
<span   class="bold"><b>nexti</b></span> command executes the next
instruction, unless that instruction calls a function, in which
case <span   class="bold"><b>nexti</b></span> executes the entire
function.</p><p>The memory inspection command
<span   class="bold"><b>x</b></span> (for &ldquo;examine&rdquo;) prints the
contents of memory. It can be used in two ways:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>x/</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>nfu addr</em></span>
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>x </b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>addr</em></span>
</pre><p>The first form provides explicit formatting information; the
second form accepts the default (which is, generally, whatever
format was used for the previous <span   class="bold"><b>x</b></span>
or <span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> command&mdash;or hexadecimal,
if there hasn't been a previous command).
<b  ><i><tt>addr</tt></i></b> is the address
whose contents you want to display.</p><p>Formatting information is given by
<b  ><i><tt>nfu</tt></i></b>, which is a
sequence of three items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  ><i><tt>n</tt></i></b> is
a repeat count that specifies how many data items to print;</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>f</tt></i></b>
specifies what format to use for the output;</p></li><li><p><b  ><i><tt>u</tt></i></b>
specifies the size of the data unit (e.g., byte, word,
etc.).</p></li></ul></div><p>For example, let's investigate <b  >s</b> in line
79 of our program. <span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> shows
that it's pointer to a <b  >struct tms</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
79          s = &amp;start_time;
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>print s</b></span>
$1 = (struct tms *) 0xf7fffae8
</pre><p>The easy way to investigate further would be to use the
command <b  >print *s</b>, which displays the individual
fields of the data structure.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>print *s</b></span>
$2 = {tms_utime = 9, tms_stime = 14,
tms_cutime = 0, tms_cstime = 0}
</pre><p>For the sake of argument, let's use
<span   class="bold"><b>x</b></span> to examine the data here. The
<b  >struct tms</b> (which is defined in the header file
time.h) consists of four <b  >int</b> fields; so we need
to print four decimal words. We can do that with the command
<span   class="bold"><b>x/4dw</b></span>, starting at location
<b  >s</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>x/4dw s</b></span>
0xf7fffae8 &lt;_end+-138321592&gt;:  9  14  0  0
</pre><p>The four words starting at location <b  >s</b> are
9, 14, 0, and 0&mdash;which agrees with what
<span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> shows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x164ac48"></a>Signals</h2></div></div><p>gdb normally traps most signals sent to it. By trapping
signals, gdb gets to decide what to do with the process you are
running. For example, pressing CTRL-C sends the interrupt signal to
gdb, which would normally terminate it. But you probably don't want
to interrupt gdb; you really want to interrupt the program that gdb
is running. Therefore, gdb catches the signal and stops the program
it is running; this lets you do some debugging.</p><p>The command <span   class="bold"><b>handle</b></span> controls
signal handling. It takes two arguments: a signal name, and what
should be done when the signal arrives. For example, let's say that
you want to intercept the signal <b  >SIGPIPE</b>,
preventing the program you're debugging from seeing it. Whenever it
arrives, though, you want the program to stop, and you want some
notification. To accomplish this, give the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>handle SIGPIPE stop print</b></span>
</pre><p>Note that signal names are always capital letters! You may
use signal numbers instead of signal names.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x164af60"></a>C++ Programs</h2></div></div><p>If you write in C++ and compile with
<span   class="bold"><b>g++</b></span>, you'll find gdb to be a
wonderful environment. It completely understands the syntax of the
language and how classes extend the concept of C structures. Let's
look at a trivial program to see how gdb treats classes and
constructors. <a href="1298l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> contains a
listing produced in gdb.</p><p>In order to see the program in action, we'll set a breakpoint
at the <b  >entry</b> statement on line 24. This
declaration invokes a function, of course&mdash;the
<b  >entry</b> constructor.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>b 24</b></span>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x23e4: file ref.C, line 24.
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>run</b></span>
Starting program: /home/los/mikel/crossref/ref
Breakpoint 1, main (argc=1, argv=0xeffffd8c) at
ref.C:24
24           entry entry_1(text_1, strlen(text_1),
ref_1);
</pre><p>Now we'll enter the function. We do this through the
<span   class="bold"><b>step</b></span> command, just as when
entering a function in C.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>step</b></span>
entry::entry (this=0xeffffcb8, text=0x2390
"Finding errors in C++ programs",
    length=30, ref=0x23b0 "errc++") at ref.C:14
14                e_text = new char(length+1);
</pre><p>gdb has moved to the first line of the
<b  >entry</b> constructor, showing us the arguments with
which the function was invoked. When we return to the main program,
we can print the variable <b  >entry_1</b> just like any
other data structure.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>print entry_1</b></span>
$1 = {e_text = 0x6128 "Finding errors in C++
programs",
  e_reference = "errc++",
  '\e000' &lt;repeats 73 times&gt;}
</pre><p>So C++ debugging is just as straightforward as C
debugging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc7580.0x164b698"></a>Command Editing</h2></div></div><p>Another useful feature is the ability to edit your commands
in order to correct errors in typing. gdb provides a subset of the
editing commands available in Emacs, letting you move back and
forth along the line you're typing. For example, consider the
command below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>stop in gen_and_sort</b></span>
</pre><p>If this doesn't look familiar to you, it shouldn't; it's a
<span   class="bold"><b>dbx</b></span> command. We really meant to
type <b  >break gen_and_sort</b>. To fix this, we can
type <b  >ESC b</b> three times, to move back over the
three words in <b  >gen_and_sort</b> (spaces,
underscores, and other punctuation define what's meant by a
&ldquo;word&rdquo;). Then we type <b  >ESC DEL</b> twice, to delete
the erroneous command <b  >stop in</b>. Finally, we type
the correct command, <b  >break</b>, followed by RETURN
to execute it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) <span   class="bold"><b>break gen_and_sort</b></span>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x2544: file qsort2.c, line 79.
(gdb)
</pre><p>Emacs has a special mode that makes it particularly easy to
use gdb. To start it, give the command <b  >ESC x
gdb</b>. Emacs prompts you for a filename in the
minibuffer:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Run gdb (like this): gdb
</pre><p>Add the executable's name and press RETURN; Emacs then starts
a special window for running gdb, where you can give all regular
gdb commands. When you stop at a breakpoint, gdb automatically
creates a window displaying your source code, and marking the point
where you have stopped, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        struct tms end_time, *e;
        int begin, end;
=&gt;      s = &amp;start_time;
        e = &amp;end_time;
</pre><p>The mark <b  >=&gt;</b> shows the next line to be
executed. The position is updated whenever gdb stops
execution&mdash;that is, after every single-step, after every
<span   class="bold"><b>continue</b></span>, etc. You may never need
to use the built-in <span   class="bold"><b>list</b></span> command
again!</p><p>This article was adapted from the book &ldquo;Programming with GNU
