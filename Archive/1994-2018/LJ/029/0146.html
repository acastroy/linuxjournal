    With a new major release of Linux it was time to see what
    the father of the OS had to say.
    </p></div></div><div class="qandaset"><a name="N0x29fc580.0x2af4500"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x29fc580.0x2af4500"></a></h4><p>Phil:</p><p>Why is 2.0 so wonderful?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>If you mean &ldquo;why do we call it 2.0 instead of 1.4&rdquo;, then
the answer is that there are a lot of major conceptual jumps in it,
notably the multi-architecture support and the SMP [symmetrical
multi-processor] support. Even with nothing else new, those two
features certainly are enough to warrant a major number bump.</p><p>Note that this doesn't mean that the multi-architecture and
SMP work is finished&mdash;the only really supported platforms in 2.0
will be alpha and the x86, and the SMP stuff will need to be worked
on too in order to scale better. The important thing about 2.0 is
that the support is there, even though we'll obviously continue
working on it (the same way 1.0 had networking support, even though
we obviously had to work on that too after releasing 1.0).</p><p>Now, if the &ldquo;why is 2.0 so wonderful&rdquo; question is more
&ldquo;why should I upgrade&rdquo;, i.e., you have a machine that is already
supported by 1.2, then the answer is that no, you don't have to
upgrade, but there are lots of things that makes an upgrade to 2.0
a good idea.</p><p>For example, performance is much better, especially in the
networking and NFS client department. If you have your home
directory NFS-mounted, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>definitely</em></span> want to
upgrade. There are other areas too where 2.0 is noticeably faster,
like process handling and filesystem throughput.</p><p>Also, 2.0 finally supports read-write shared memory mappings
of files, along with file descriptor passing, using Unix domain
sockets. Those are the two major things that 1.2 doesn't do and
that most other modern Unices support.</p><p>Phil:</p><p>What comes next?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>The SPARC and the PPC port are very close to being integrated
into the normal kernel&mdash;most of it is already there, just a few
things missing that haven't been applied due to the code-freeze.
And MIPS support will also probably go in early in the 2.1
development kernels. So, during 2.1 we'll get a lot of new
interesting architectures supported&mdash;essentially 2.0 lays the
ground work for multi-architecture, and so it becomes a lot easier
to do ports now.</p><p>Also, SMP needs to do finer-granularity locking for good
performance on more CPU's, and while SMP currently works on the x86
and Sparc, we'll probably work on making the other architectures
SMP-aware too.</p><p>There are obviously other things too: the normal kernel
update stuff, more drivers, and more performance improvements.
IPv6, DECnet etc.</p><p>Phil:</p><p>Anything about yourself that you want to share?
Lots of people ask us to cover more about who the developers are.
They can read the code or the documentation but not everyone can
meet the developers.</p><p>Linus:</p><p>Ehh, umm, aahh... Nothing much has happened, I finally got my
BSc but I'm still working on my masters degree. It's slow, as Linux
obviously takes a lot of my time. Hopefully I'll have it done by
the end of the year, I mainly just have the thesis to write. It's
not as if I didn't have anything to write about, it's just hard to
get started with so much else going on.</p><p>Tove [Linus' &ldquo;significant other&rdquo;] and the cats are doing
fine...</p><p>Phil:</p><p>When you get your masters degree do you plan on
&ldquo;getting a real job&rdquo; or do you intend to stay the highest-profile
unemployed person in the computer field?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>Hey, I resent that remark. I'm not unemployed, I'm just
selective about what I do...</p><p>Actually, I've been employed by the University of Helsinki
for the last few years, and that has been paying my bills. While
I'm still studying, I also work in a research and teaching
position. And the CS department is flexible enough that I can do
Linux on work hours, and they encourage this by trying to keep my
other work at a minimum.</p><p>Obviously a &ldquo;real job&rdquo; pays better than most universities
will pay, but I've been very happy with this arrangement&mdash;I get to
do whatever I want, and I have no commercial pressures whatsoever
doing this. Getting a masters won't change things radically,
although it will obviously make it easier for me to accept other
work as I don't need to worry about wanting to graduate some
day.</p><p>As I've been able to live happily on university pay, the
deciding factor is not so much the money as the interest level of
any &ldquo;real job&rdquo; (but lest somebody gets the idea that money
doesn't matter at all, I'll just mention that yes, it does).</p><p>Phil:</p><p>How much of the code in the kernel is still yours?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>Umm.... Very little when it comes to the number of lines.
What's still &ldquo;mine&rdquo; is the mm/*.c, kernel/*.c, fs/*.c (only the
BVFS code, not the specific filesystem stuff) and parts of the x86
and alpha-specific low-level architecture files.</p><p>Even those parts have much of the code contributed by others,
but the basic stuff is still pretty closely under my control. It's
essentially all of the really basic stuff&mdash;things that everything
else depends on.</p><p>There are lots of things I haven't really even touched: most
of the device drivers are totally written by others, and while they
sometimes are based on stuff I have written they really aren't mine
any more. Same goes for a lot of the filesystem code.</p><p>The networking has been completely written by others,
although I've touched some of it.</p><p>In lines of code, I probably am responsible for about 10%
these days. That's just a rough guess, I haven't really taken a
look.</p><p>Phil:</p><p>How (or maybe why) does project management work?
That is, Linux is a huge effort and it continues to progress very
well. How is this cooperation possible?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>Most of it happens automatically&mdash;people who are doing things
for fun do things the right way by themselves. That said, I do work
8 hours a day (and that's just about minimum) on Linux, and most of
the time goes to administrative things, mostly email. And it's not
as if I'm the only &ldquo;manager&rdquo;--there are others who manage their
own subsystems and then send me already cleaned-up patches (notably
when it comes to networking).</p><p>Phil:</p><p>Is there any expertise lacking? Is there something
or someone that, if available, would make development go
better?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>I think we're doing pretty well. I need longer days (and
nights!), but there isn't anything specific we really need. Lots of
areas needing work, and lots of developers that don't have enough
time, but we can't really complain.</p><p>Phil:</p><p>We asked this before, but the answer may have
changed. What, if anything, did you do wrong in Linux development.
(When Ken Thompson was asked this about Unix he said he left the
&ldquo;e&rdquo; off the &ldquo;creat&rdquo; system call. Is there something that you
would do different?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>I'll be arrogant and say &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;. I think that's the same
answer as last time. I've made lots of mistakes, but that's okay
and normal, and the kernel is the better for it&mdash;it tends to only
help make the corrected version more robust. And I've obviously
conned a lot of people to work for free on this project!</p><p>Phil:</p><p>Are there any shows you will be attending in the
U.S. later this year or in early 1997?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>I hope to attend at least the USELINUX conference (or
whatever it's officially called) in January. No firm plans...</p><p>Phil:</p><p>I hope to see you there and let you trade some of
the virtual beer I promised for the real stuff.</p><p>Gena:</p><p>How do you feel about commercialization of Linux?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>On the whole, it's a very positive thing for me. I'm not
worried about the kernel itself or the basic system&mdash;all the
commercialization is about the distributions and the applications.
As such, it only brings value-added things to Linux, and it doesn't
take anything away from the Linux scene.</p><p>However, I don't think commercialization is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>answer</em></span> to anything. It's just one more facet
of Linux, and not the deciding one by any means. Let me mention
Wabi as an example&mdash;a commercial windows emulator (that may
actually be out by the time this article hits print; it's in beta
testing now).</p><p>Wabi is a nice program (I've been using it to make slides
with PowerPoint under Linux) and a lot of people will find the
reason to pay for it. However, it won't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>revolutionalize</em></span> Linux the way Wine may do&mdash;a
freely available windows emulation package will make a lot of
difference for the whole market, while Wabi makes a lot of
difference to only a subset of the market. Obviously, right now
Wabi is a lot more advanced than Wine, but we'll see what happens
in a year or two.</p><p>Gena:</p><p>What challenges do you see the Linux Community
facing in the next 10 years?</p><p>How do you feel about commercialization of Linux?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>I'm having trouble planning two weeks ahead, much less 10
years... It's too hard to say what will happen. It all depends on
availability of good applications, and the first steps are being
taken with both commercial and free end-user applications starting
to appear. Linux already has a lot of traditional UNIX
applications, what I'm really looking forward to is the desktop
personal and business stuff...</p><p>Gena:</p><p>What advice/pearls o' wisdom would you share with
new members of the Linux Community?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>Umm.... &ldquo;Be excellent to each other&rdquo;? No, wrong movie..
Ahh.. &ldquo;Multiply and populate the earth&rdquo;? Naah, that's been done
too..</p><p>Gena:</p><p>What keeps you motivated (i.e., why do you keep on
doin' what you do)?</p><p>Linus:</p><p>It's a very interesting project, and I get to sit there like
a spider in its web, looking at the poor new users struggling with
it. Mwbhahahhaaahaaa..</p><p>No, seriously, what kept me going initially after I had
&ldquo;completed&rdquo; my first test-versions of Linux back in '91 was the
enthusiasm of people, and knowing people find my work interesting
and fun, and that there are people out there depending on me.
That's still true today.</p><p>And it really is technically interesting too&mdash;still, after
these five years. New challenges, new things people need or find
interesting. But the community is really what keeps me
going.</p><p>Phil:</p><p>Thanks. A case of virtual beer will be on the way.</p><p>Linus:</p><p>Virtual, smirtual.. Where's the <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> stuff?</p></div></div>
