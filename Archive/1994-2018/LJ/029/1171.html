    If the process of creating documents with TeX or LaTeX has
    confused you, Evelyn may have the answer you have been
    searching for.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad2580.0x1bca500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the first things you notice about
TeX or LaTeX is that neither have a good user interface. In order
to run either program, you must type in commands at the prompt
line. While running, error and status messages are written to your
terminal. The process is more like compiling a program than using a
<a href="1171s1.html" target="_self">word processor</a>. Just as you would
compile, link and then test with a C compiler, so in TeX you
compile and preview.
</p><p>Running TeX or LaTeX is only part of what you need to do to
create a good-looking document. TeX compiles your source into a dvi
file (DeVice Independent), which is conceptually similar to an
object file produced from a C source file. In order to view or
print a dvi file, you must use a viewer like xdvi or convert the
dvi to a PostScript or a Portable BitMap (pbm) file. This is a
completely different process than when a word processor is
used&mdash;there you get to see how your words will look when they are
printed as you type and format them. With a word processor, you can
usually print without the extra step of converting between print
formats.</p><p>Writing documents in a way similar to writing programs is not
what most writers are familiar with today. The advantage of this
style of production cycle is that it is easier for the writer to
focus on the task at hand. That is, while writing, you don't have
to worry about hyphenation or page breaks. Also, while formatting,
you can concentrate on applying a consistent structure to your
document without worrying about how that structure will show up on
the printed page. Finally, when you are working with how the
structure is displayed, you can be more sure that your formatting
will be applied consistently throughout the document, than when you
are using Words for Windows, for example.</p><p>I use a menu interface to TeX/LaTeX and associated programs
called <a href="1171f1.html" target="_self">xtem</a> that I found on the
Internet at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). CTAN has
a WWW page at O'Reilly and Associates
(<a href="http://jasper.ora.com/ctan.html" target="_self">jasper.ora.com/ctan.html</a>),
and is the place to go for fonts, filters, style sheets, back
issues of the TeX Users Group newsletter, TUGboat and all the other
things you may want in order to use TeX more effectively.</p><p>Without xtem, I'd still be trying to get all the pieces
together. With xtem, I am creating complex documents in just a few
hours. It helps me manage all the tasks I need to accomplish to
write and format letters, articles and longer documents. For
example, I can manage my bibliography database with BibTeX, check
spelling with ispell and even check my TeX syntax with
texchk.</p><p>The name xtem comes from X11-TeX-menu. It is a Tcl/Tk program
written by G. Lamprecht, W. Lotz and R. Weibezahn of Bremen
University in Germany (weibezahn@lrw.uni-bremen.de). It requires
version 7.4 of Tcl and version 4.0 of Tk. The latest version of
xtem is version 4, and I'll be describing this version.</p><p>xtem provides on-line help for LaTeX syntax. The LaTeX
commands are illustrated with sample output, which is handy for
things like demonstrating LaTeX commands with sample output for
both LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e. The on-line help very useful when I
was first learning LaTeX, but finding it was a little confusing for
me. The help window is supposed to come up automatically when you
open a .tex file to edit or when
you select the &ldquo;<a href="1171f2.html" target="_self">help</a>&rdquo; button with the middle mouse button. I
suspect there was some problem with my installation, because I
couldn't get the &ldquo;right mouse button for help on a menu item&rdquo; to
work.</p><p>xtem was easy to install. I picked up the file
xtem_texmenu.tar.gz off the Internet via ftp from
ftp.lrw.uni-bremen.de in the directory /pub/tex/xtem/. The file is
about 1.2MB compressed. It decompresses to about 3MB.</p><p>I first decompressed it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ gunzip xtem_texmenu.tar.gz
</pre><p>Then I checked whether I would have to create a directory for
the archive with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar tf xtem_texmenu.tar
</pre><p>All the files in the archive are under /xtem, so I
de-archived them with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xf xtem_texmenu.tar
</pre><p>To use xtem, according to the xtem/README file, I needed
Unix, Tcl/Tk, XWindows (X11R4 or R5 or R6) and a three button
mouse, as well as TeX/LaTeX, an editor and a viewer. You'll also
need a spell checker, BibTeX for handling bibliographies, makeindex
for creating an index, etc.</p><p>Most of these programs, e.g., TeX/LaTeX and Tcl/Tk, were
already installed on my system as they come with the Slackware
distribution of Linux, so I didn't have to install them. [They come
with all major Linux distributions as well&mdash;ED] The instructions
to install Tcl/Tk, if necessary, are included in the xtem/README
file.</p><p>xtem comes with an English and a German version, and it is
easy to add support for other languages. I installed only the
English version. Deleting the German version files in
xtem/help_german and xtem/locals_german saved about 1.2MB. It also
comes with an HTML page that describes all the included files, and
their links.</p><p>The README instructions were thorough, and the descriptions
of the steps to install xtem were in the order I needed
them.</p><p>The most complex step, and it wasn't very complex, was
modifying the /xtem/locals_english/mkcommand.vst file. I deleted
where indicated, and chose the high performance option,
(mkcommand.3_tcl7.3) because it will work under Linux and Tk7.3. I
discovered that I could choose another option while actually
running the program, so I didn't worry about picking the wrong one
while doing the installation.</p><p>I then had to modify the shell script xtem/xtem to tell it
where the programs that it manages are located. To discover where
they are on your system use the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ which <span   class="emphasis"><em>programname</em></span>
</pre><p>if you use a C shell, and the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ type -path <span   class="emphasis"><em>programname</em></span>
</pre><p>if you use the bash shell.</p><p>For example, the wishx Tk Shell is installed in
/usr/bin/wishx on my system, so I changed the wishcall line in the
shell script. I also had to add a line to set the environment
variable <b  >XTEMPATH</b> which contains the directory
path where I installed xtem. This will vary depending on your
system. On my system the line I added was:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ XTEMPATH=/tmp/xtem
</pre><p>Then I uncommented the line which set the default language to
English:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
defaultlanguage="english"
</pre><p>by removing the pound sign (#) at the beginning of the
line.</p><p>The rest of the xtem configuration options can be set while
the program is running, just by selecting any of the menu buttons
with the middle mouse button.</p><p>Once I had checked to see that it worked, I moved the xtem
application to /users/local/bin, and the rest of the xtem directory
to /users/local/lib, changing the <b  >XTEMPATH</b> when
I did so.</p><p>About the only thing I don't use xtem for is printing, even
though there is a print option available. Once I have formatted a
file in Tex/LaTeX, I take a look at it with either xdvi or
Ghostview, depending on whether I'm going to be printing it or not.
xdvi looks closer to the printed output than Ghostview, but viewing
in Ghostview automatically invokes the dvi to PostScript filter,
and saves the PostScript file. My printer is connected to a
different computer and I use Ghostscript to print, so when
everything looks perfect in xdvi, I view the file in Ghostview and
print from the .ps file.</p><p>xtem is a program that makes it easier for someone new to TeX
to manage all of the different programs. It provides a complete
on-line help system with formatted examples of the different LaTeX
commands. However, xtem is more than training wheels. It has a
couple of essential features I use regularly, since they make TeX
file management much easier. The first is cleanup, which allowed me
to delete all of the .log, .aux and other files created in a TeX
session from one window. The second is that xtem tries to catch
&ldquo;conflict&rdquo; situations. This means it warns me if I'm
spell-checking a file I am already using in an open edit session.
stem doesn't prevent me from getting into trouble; it just lets me
know that I may be making changes that won't be saved.</p><p>I recommend xtem because of the detailed help files for LaTeX
syntax, and because it makes managing all the different programs I
use with LaTeX easy. It is also easy to customize for different
installations, even for someone without a lot of Unix experience.
Essentially, xtem has made using LaTeX clearer to me.</p></div></div>
