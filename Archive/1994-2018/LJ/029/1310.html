    A software solution that allows you to run PC programs ona
    SPARC station.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c5580.0x24bd558"></a></h2></div></div><p>By far, the majority of my time involving
a computer was spent working with my Sun SPARCstation. I could do
almost everything computer related, including e-mail interaction,
system administration, net surfing, network Doom (I confess&mdash;it was
me who circulated that hack so you could run Doom on Solaris 2.3),
all on the same machine I used for software development.
Occasionally, though, I found myself firing up the ol' PC on my
desk, using MS Word to crank out documentation or a memo, or to run
one of a handful of smaller utility programs I purchased years ago.
Well, that got old quick! Having two keyboards, two monitors, and
two computers on one's desk consumes more than desktop real
estate&mdash;it takes much more time to maintain and introduces
frustrations from the disparate OS designs. So, I began looking for
a software solution which would allow me to run on my SPARCstation
the handful of PC programs I used.
</p><p>The idea of paying a lot of money to run something I'd
already purchased didn't sit well with me, and I was interested in
finding something I could extend if necessary. A little searching
on the Internet didn't turn up anything low- or no-budget that
would run MS Windows 3.1 on a SPARC and for which source code was
accessible. The Wine and DOSEMU projects were making great
progress, but they would never run on non-x86 architectures. There
was an emulator program called pcemu, which would run on a SPARC.
It did what it was intended to very well&mdash;run DOS. Unfortunately,
it was engineered to emulate an 8086, and didn't lend itself to be
extended to support 80286 and 80386 features. My search also turned
up another 8086 emulator, one which went along with an older
version of MINIX, allowing MINIX to run on non-x86 platforms. Since
it was geared toward allowing a real mode version of MINIX to run
within the emulator, this didn't seem like a good candidate for
enhancing either.</p><p>There just wasn't anything out there that would do what I
wanted it to do or which would be a good starting point if I was
willing to put the effort into enhancing it. At the same time, I
noticed significant similar interest on the net, specifically in
the comp.emulators.* newsgroups. At that point, I began working on
Bochs (pronounced &ldquo;box&rdquo;), a portable software PC emulator
project, with the goal of making it possible to run PC software on
a Unix workstation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c5580.0x24bd710"></a>Bochs' Journey</h2></div></div><p>Looking back, it's still hard to believe it all came
together. The biggest hurdle often was documentation. Here we have
a somewhat undocumented DOS (and later Windows) trying to use parts
of a multitude of non-standardized and sometimes poorly documented
BIOSs, using hardware devices which aren't always documented
accurately or fully, and running on a non-open Intel x86
architecture, which has undocumented instructions and features
(e.g., LOADALL). If it weren't for the likes of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Undocumented PC</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Undocumented
DOS</em></span>, I would have quit a long time ago. The other large
hurdle was (and will be) tracking down and fixing the bugs which
seem nearly impossible to find in such a complex system. One wrong
bit flipped here, and sometimes the ill effect shows up 10 million
instructions later, when the wrong character is displayed on the
screen! Bugs which depend on timings proved to be elusive, since
they don't always show up, and timing is drastically affected by
the debug print statements inserted in the code. I've had occasion
to sift through debug files of some 50+ megabytes (which I refer to
as stealth bug contrails), only to find I didn't print out the one
piece of info I needed!</p><p>In the two and a half years I've worked on this software,
Bochs has made it past some very important landmarks. The first was
booting up MS DOS 5.0 to the A prompt! At that point, I had only
very rudimentary text HGA (a monochrome video card) emulation and
no keyboard support, so I had to hardwire keystrokes into the
keyboard BIOS to get past the time and date prompts during boot and
to run DOS commands afterwards. It wasn't pretty, but it showed
there was potential.</p><p>I was then on my way to implementing the graphics mode of the
HGA and basic keyboard support, in an attempt to get Windows 3.0
running in real mode. After many red-eye nights, I managed to get
Windows 3.0 to boot up past the initial graphics banner screen.
What a sight that was! I remember staring at the screen, soaking it
all in, not daring to type any keys, fearing it would hang Windows.
Indeed it did, and that's when I knew I was right on
track...</p><p>Though I had designed the emulator to be 32-bit right from
the start, at this point I had only 8086 emulation. It was time to
take the plunge and implement the protection and memory management
models of the 80286. Surprisingly, after only a few months, I had
coded a large part of 80286 support and was able to get MS Windows
3.1 (and 3.0) running in standard mode (286 protected mode).</p><p>Though MS Windows and MS-DOS have been largely the software I
focus on running within the emulator, I've had some other
interesting experiences. Recently, I've been working with the MINIX
project (Andrew S. Tanenbaum and friends) to get it to boot/work
under the Bochs emulator. The idea is to allow MINIX (a Unix clone
suited for learning how internals work) to run on platforms to
which it has not been ported. Recently, I was able to perform a
full MINIX installation within Bochs and to boot up MINIX in 286
protected mode (although more work needs to be done).</p><p>I worked with and integrated my source code with the DOSEMU
project's source, for a while. However, they were so productive
with their code changes, it was hard to keep up, especially before
things began to solidify with Bochs, and I had soon written my own
keyboard and video support.</p><p>When I get to 80386 emulation (I've recently began this
trek), I look forward to talking with the Wine team to look at the
potential of a compile-time, optional merge of Wine and Bochs,
allowing Wine to run on non-x86 platforms. Wine contains an MS
Windows-to-X Windows/Unix translation technology, but it lacks x86
emulation which would allow it to run on other platforms. A merger
would mean a significant performance gain could be achieved while
running Windows within Bochs, since the Windows GUI and OS calls
would be mapped to native Unix/X functions by Wine, instead of
Bochs emulating the whole process entailed by the the Windows call.
This is the same basic concept behind Sun's Wabi product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c5580.0x24bdad8"></a>A Technical Look at Bochs</h2></div></div><p>Since the term &ldquo;emulator&rdquo; has been tossed around quite a
bit in recent times, let me clarify the different types of
emulation. Software such as DOSEMU and Wine are, in my terminology,
environmental or OS emulators. That is, they run the executables
natively (x86 code running on an x86 processor) and translate or
&ldquo;emulate&rdquo; the interaction between the OS the executable expects
(like MS Windows) and the OS that is currently running (like
Linux). This kind of &ldquo;emulation&rdquo; is bound to an x86 platform,
since no instruction set emulation is provided, but it is very
efficient and an excellent alternative to having a dual-boot setup
on your x86 machine.</p><p>Bochs is a pure emulator in that it emulates each x86
instruction in software, along with the necessary BIOS and hardware
you expect to find on a PC. There's one giant decode loop, which
closely models the fetch-decode-execute actions of the CPU.
Components of the CPU&mdash;namely the registers&mdash;are modeled by fields
in a large structure representing the CPU. Main memory is
represented by a large array of memory within the C program. Input
and output devices, such as the keyboard, timers, PIC, etc., are of
a very modular design, &ldquo;plugging into&rdquo; the rest of the code via
the registration of their corresponding IRQ, I/O address space
usage, and interrupt service routines.</p><p>Bochs needed to emulate a graphics card supported by Windows,
and I chose the monochrome Hercules Graphics Adapter (HGA), since
it was the simplest to implement. Using an X window to represent
the PC monitor and video frame buffer was a portable and natural
choice, and it provided a keyboard input mechanism, as well.</p><p>Since all instructions are emulated in the C language, Bochs
is not bound to any particular processor and is very portable to
many other Unix platforms. I want to extend this theme as far as
possible, and would like to see Bochs ported to other non Unix-like
OSs, like Mac OS.</p><p>As with any emulation software, performance is always an
issue, as running programs under an emulator is inherently slower
than running native software. I've tried to keep performance in
mind while coding Bochs, though I am postponing some optimizations
until later, so that they don't interfere with the development path
towards 386 emulation.</p><p>A few people have asked me if I had any plans for adding
dynamic compilation techniques to Bochs to enhance the performance.
I strongly subscribe to the K.I.S.S. philosophy, and I'd like to
keep the source simple, understandable, and manageable, so I doubt
I will add it any time soon. There is room in the immediate future
for some more traditional performance enhancements, however. I
think flags processing is an area with potential performance
improvements. Though, one of the blessings of using such a
simplistic (and brute-force) method of emulation, devoid of many
fancy optimizations, is there are no problems handling
self-modifying code, since the instruction stream is decoded and
executed on-the-fly.</p><p>From the beginning, I coded Bochs to be a 32-bit emulator
(386 and up). Internally, registers and other features have always
been represented by 32-bit quantities. This has been an immense
help, as I continue to add 32-bit processor features to the
emulation support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c5580.0x24bddf0"></a>Compiling and Installing Bochs</h2></div></div><p>Since I began use of the GNU &ldquo;autoconf&rdquo; utility, the
configuration and compilation process has become much easier and
more portable. However, the process of setting up the environment
(hard disk and floppy image files, VGA font, etc.) and the
installation of DOS/Windows 3.1 within Bochs is a little lengthier.
Consult the INSTALL file within the Bochs distribution for details.
However, to give you a feel for the compilation and configuration
process, I'm including the commands I use to compile Bochs and
install Windows 3.1 on my Linux machine. Note, I'm using tcsh, and
commands may vary on different platforms.</p><p>First, unpack the distribution:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd parent-dir
$ gzip -dc bochs-<span   class="emphasis"><em>YYMMDD</em></span>.tgz | tar xvf -
</pre><p>Then configure the Makefile and source code, and
compile.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd bochs-<span   class="emphasis"><em>YYMMDD</em></span>
$ setenv CFLAGS "-O3 -Wall -m486"
$ ./configure --enable-80286 \\
  --enable-native-floppy
$ make
</pre><p>If you are using a Bourne shell, such as bash, setenv will
not work. Use</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall -m486"; export CFLAGS
</pre><p>instead.</p><p>You may need to install the &ldquo;VGA&rdquo; font. Read the INSTALL
file within the bochs distribution for this procedure. Your font
directory may be /usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc,
/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/misc, or somewhere else.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp fonts/vga.pcf <span   class="emphasis"><em>font-dir</em></span>
$ mkfontdir <span   class="emphasis"><em>font-dir</em></span>
</pre><p>Create a <span   class="bold"><b>bootable</b></span> 1.44M
floppy containing the DOS FORMAT and FDISK executables,
<span   class="bold"><b>using a real DOS machine</b></span>. Assuming
the 1.44MB floppy is drive A:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
C:&gt; FORMAT /s /u A:
C:&gt; COPY FORMAT.COM A:
C:&gt; COPY FDISK.EXE A:
</pre><p>Now insert this floppy into your workstation, and create an
image of it as a Unix file. Assuming your 1.44MB floppy drive is
/dev/fd0, do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ dd if=/dev/fd0 ibs=512 of=1.44
</pre><p>Create an empty 1.2M floppy image file for B: (unused in this
example):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=1.2 bs=512 count=2400
</pre><p>Now create a 20MB hard disk image file (other sizes are
possible, but we'll stick with a simple example for now):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=20M bs=512 count=41820
</pre><p>Edit the .bochsrc file included at the top level of the
source. Change the floppya line to <b  >floppya:
file=./1.44</b>, change the floppyb line to <b  >floppyb:
file=./1.2</b>, and change the diskc line to <b  >diskc:
file=./20M</b>.</p><p>Boot Bochs with the 1.44M floppy image file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ bochs -bootA
</pre><p>Bochs should now be running. Press the Return key a couple of
times and accept the date and time.</p><p>Use FDISK to partition the C: drive (the 20M file). Add the
whole drive as a PRIMARY partition. That is, run FDISK, and type
Return three times; once to &ldquo;Create DOS partition or Logical DOS
Drive&rdquo;, once to &ldquo;Create Primary DOS Partition&rdquo;, and once to
chose the maximum size.</p><p>At this point, just click a mouse button on the window to
exit bochs. Since Bochs doesn't support rebooting yet, you must
exit and restart Bochs, then format the C: drive and add the DOS
system files to it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ bochs -bootA
A&gt; FORMAT /u /s c:
</pre><p>Again, quit Bochs by clicking any mouse button in the
window.</p><p>Now change the <b  >floppya</b> line in .bochsrc to
<b  >floppya: 1_44=/dev/fd0</b>. Put Disk 1 of the
Windows 3.1 installation set in the floppy drive. Then restart
Bochs, booting from the hard drive image file, and fire up the
Windows 3.1 installation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ bochs -bootC
C&gt; a:setup

</pre><p>Press the Enter key to install Windows now, and press. &ldquo;c&rdquo;
to do a custom installation. Press Enter again to install Windows
in the default C:\WINDOWS location.</p><p>In the Windows Setup screen, everything should be recognized
fine, except the keyboard type, which you will need to change. Use
the arrow keys to select &ldquo;All AT keyboards&rdquo;. Continue installing
Windows, using keystrokes only (remember, clicking the mouse in the
window exits Bochs). There is no point in setting up printers and
applications. Allow Windows to create (or change) your AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS files, and watch Windows boot. Then return to DOS,
click in the window to exit Bochs, and restart Bochs and
Windows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ bochs -bootC
C&gt; WIN
</pre><p><a href="1310f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows a sample

Bochs has been largely determined by the suite of software which
I've run within the emulator environment. A lot of my effort has
been focused on supporting enough features to run MS DOS 5.0 and
Windows 3.1. Recently, I've added Minix 1.7.2 to my list of
targeted software. Given this, Bochs currently supports the
following items: (Keep in mind that new features are always being
added, and some of these may only be available in the next
release):</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>8086/80286 instruction set</b></span>
including protection and virtual memory models. An option to the
configuration script allows for compiling for either
architecture.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Monochrome Hercules Graphics Adapter
(HGA)</b></span> This is a fairly simplistic graphics adapter with
character and pixel mapped graphics capabilities. Text and pixel
graphics are mapped to an X window.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Floppy drives: 1.44M 3.5", 1.2M 5.25",
and 720K 3.5"</b></span> These are implemented by mapping them to
either Unix files of the corresponding size or to the floppy drive
on your workstation. Originally, only BIOS software interrupts
(like a subroutine call) were supported, but recently I added a
minimal amount of Direct Memory Access (DMA) and floppy I/O support
for use with Minix.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hard drives: 10, 20, or 30-Megabyte
drives</b></span> Hard drives are also implemented as a Unix file.
Read and write requests to the hard drive are directed to read()
and write() Unix system calls, operating on the hard disk image
file. Access to the hard drive is currently limited to BIOS
software interrupts. It's likely that use of DMA and hard drive I/O
will be added.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Master/slave Programmable Interrupt
Controller (PIC)</b></span> Hardware devices which need to
communicate their need to interrupt the CPU to be serviced are
attached to either PIC. These include the keyboard, system timer,
disk controller, etc. A fairly complete emulation of both master
and slave PIC is provided.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Non-enhanced keyboard</b></span>
Keystroke input from the X window used for the video display,
provides input for the keyboard emulation. Both BIOS keyboard
software interrupt (int 16H) and hardware I/O access are provided.
The keyboard code still needs a little work.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>CMOS functions</b></span> I've
implemented only a partial set of CMOS functions, although it
allows both BIOS software interrupt and hardware I/O access.
Primarily, functions which deal with CMOS time, date, and shutdown
status are provided. A CMOS real-time clock (RTC) has not yet been
implemented.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>A fair amount of typical BIOS
interrupts and data area values</b></span> These functions include
sensing features and capabilities of your PC, memory size
information, reading/writing floppy and hard disk sectors, an
interval timer, video functions, a bootstrap loader, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Makefile configuration via GNU 'autoconf'</b></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Runs DOS 5.0, Windows 3.0, Windows
3.1</b></span> Additionally, I was able to install and boot up
Minix 1.7.2, but more work needs to be done.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c5580.0x28b77f8"></a>Why and What for Bochs' Future</h2></div></div><p>There are many more features to add to Bochs to truly make it
a useful tool. In the near future, the plan is to focus on adding
the 80386 features set, since this will allow Bochs to run
up-to-date operating systems, such as Windows 95 and 32-bit code
within Windows 3.1. I have other improvements in mind, and I get
more ideas from suggestions and input I receive via the Net. Here's
a list of additional features I have planned:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>386, 486, and other x86 generation
features</b></span> There's a good start on 32-bit emulation
already. Coding should progress nicely; testing and debugging will
be slower and more arduous. This should allow Bochs to run Minix
for 386, Windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, Windows 95, and
Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Networking</b></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Floating point coprocessor emulation</b></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mouse emulation</b></span> I've
already got a good start on emulating a PS/2 mouse, but since it's
so intimately integrated with the keyboard hardware, it makes
debugging the keyboard/mouse code difficult. Mouse code is
currently disabled until I revisit it. I'd really like to get good
(low-level) documentation on a Logitech or other bus mouse, in
which case I'd happily implement it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>File system redirector</b></span> This
would allow DOS or Windows to map a drive, such as E:, to your Unix
directory (e.g., /home/johndoe/windows-drive). You'd also be able
to read CDs mounted on your Unix file system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>More performance
enhancements</b></span> I'm hesitant to do much in the way of
performance enhancements until 386 features are coded, but
afterwards, a lot of elements of the code need to be examined for
potential performance enhancements. This will be a good time to
elicit ideas from the performance wizards of the world.</p><p>And more...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c5580.0x28b7d78"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>For further information about Bochs, the developer's e-mail
