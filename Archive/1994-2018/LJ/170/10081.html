Look (and listen) in on the OLPC's laptop audio designs.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13ff2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In January of this year, I received an XO laptop from the One Laptop Per
Child (OLPC) Project, thanks to a kindly recommendation from my friend
Dr Richard Boulanger, professor of music synthesis at the Berklee
College of Music. Rick knows that I maintain a private teaching studio
and that many of my students are youngsters who would love to play with
the XO. He also knows that I have a twin interest in Csound and Linux
audio development, two rather significant aspects of the machine. Thus,
this article focuses on my experiences so far with the XO's audio
subsystem and its sound and music software. My students have had only
brief exposure to the machine, but I conclude with some remarks
concerning their interaction with the XO and its audio capabilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13ff460"></a>
General Overview of the XO</h2></div></div><p>
There's plenty of material on the Web that describes the XO in minute
detail, so here I recap only the most salient features of the machine.
</p><p>
The XO laptop (Figure 1) is small and lightweight without feeling flimsy
or poorly constructed, and the few mobile parts are connected
firmly at their joints. The display swings up from the base and can be rotated
180 degrees left or right in its upright position. It also can be tilted
slightly backward. The keyboard is a single rubber membrane, designed for
kid-size fingers, but ham-handed adults like yours truly can plug in a
USB keyboard if necessary. A two-button touchpanel replaces the mouse,
though currently only one panel and one button are active. That's not
a problem, because only the pointer control and an entry button are required to
navigate the GUI.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10081f1.large.jpg"><img src="10081f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. One Tricked-out XO at Studio Dave
</p></div></div><p>
I'm impressed by the thought that has gone into the design of
the XO. At every level, I find consideration for the user's experience,
from the design of its battery pack to the excellence of its display
resolution. In fact, when I've shown the machine to friends, they've all
especially admired the handle and wondered aloud why their laptops didn't
include one.
</p><p>
On the software side, the XO is powered by a modified version of
Fedora Core with a 2.6.22 Linux kernel. The GUI is the renowned Sugar,
a Python-based graphic interface that is singularly unlike the typical
Linux desktops with which I'm familiar, and the Linux command-line is
easily available at any time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13ff880"></a>
Audio Hardware and Capabilities</h2></div></div><p>
The XO's CPU is a 433MHz AMD Geode LX-700. The laptop's multimedia
capabilities are provided by the Geode CS5535/CS5536 companion
chipset. According to the Wikipedia page on the Geode, the CS5535 is a
&ldquo;...Southbridge for Geode GX and Geode LX...[that] integrates four
USB ports, one ATA-66 UDMA controller, one infrared communication port,
one AC97 controller, one SMBUS controller, one LPC port, as well as GPIO,
Power Management, and legacy functional blocks&rdquo;. The processor's AC97
controller is of central importance to this article, along with the
possibilities afforded by the USB support, so let's consider exactly what
that AC97 is and what it does.
</p><p>
In 1997, Intel developed an audio codec to provide high-quality audio
services for motherboards, modems and sound hardware. The AC97 defines
a high-quality audio architecture with a sampling rate of up to 96kHz for stereo and 48kHz for multichannel digital audio recording and
playback, with bit depths up to 20 bits. The AC97 became very popular with
manufacturers and is found on most desktop machines, though it has been
superseded recently by Intel's HDA (high-definition audio). The codec
is divided into a digital controller and an analog stream handler,
effectively combining the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
converters in a single package (an appealing feature for hardware
designers). By the way, Intel's use of the word codec here refers to the
encoding/decoding of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog streams,
as distinct from binary compression/decompression codecs such as MP3, Ogg
or WMA/WMV.
</p><p>
The AC97 implementation for the CS5535 comes from an integrated Analog
Devices AD1888 chipset that provides up to six channels of digital or
analog audio output. The AD1888 is notable also for its direct connection
to the core CPU, a cost-saving factor that accords nicely with the
XO's overall design. The XO also uses another Analog Devices chipset
(the SSM2211) for audio amplification.
</p><p>
So much for audio on the inside. On the outside, we find an integrated
microphone, two integrated speakers and jacks for stereo audio output
(to headphones or other speakers) and for a monaural microphone-level
input. The jacks are standard consumer-grade sound-card connectors that
take 3.5mm mini-plugs, and I'm happy to report that connections to those
jacks are firm and steady. The jack functions also are redefinable with
the alsamixer utility, but I did not experiment with this feature. See
the OLPC Wiki page on the XO's audio hardware for more information about
redefining the audio I/O ports.
</p><p>
The XO also includes three USB ports. Obviously, these ports 
can be used to expand the machine's audio capabilities by adding a MIDI
interface or a higher-quality digital audio interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13ffb40"></a>
The Software Side: System Audio Support</h2></div></div><p>
My machine runs the ALSA sound system in version 1.0.14. Running
<tt  >dmesg</tt> reports
that the ALSA device list consists of the CS5535 audio hardware at base
address 0x1480 on IRQ5, and <tt  >modinfo</tt> reports that the cs5535audio driver
includes only one significant option, a workaround for certain faulty
AC97 implementations.
</p><p>
Under normal circumstances, ALSA is completely transparent to the
user. Activities (that is, the XO's programs) access the kernel sound services
with no intervention from the user, and sound pours forth from the
speakers. The expected ALSA utilities are all available from the command
prompt, though only to the root user. Alsamixer correctly identifies
the CS5535 as the sound card and the AD1888 as the audio chipset, and
the range of mixer controls is impressive, particularly with regard
to the surround sound capabilities of the AC97. Given this transparency,
there isn't much else to add regarding ALSA on the XO. However, readers
who want to know more details about the CS5535 audio driver should read
the papers by Jaya Kumar, developer of the cs5535audio driver (see 
Resources for links to his presentations at the Linux Audio
Conference 2007 and at FOSS/India 2006).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13ffda8"></a>
Sound and Music Activities</h2></div></div><p>
The XO is designed for the explorative mind. With regard to basic sound,
the default system provides activities for simple audio recording and
playback in various formats. However, the system's real audio attractions
are found in the TamTam activities.
</p><p>
TamTam is a suite of four programs designed for exploring and
experimenting with sound and music creation. At first glance, they may
seem to be attractive toys, but I can verify that these applications
are powerful enough to keep experienced musicians busy with their
possibilities. The TamTam designers have created a unique blend of Python
and Csound and presented the concoction to the user in an interface
that completely conceals its technical foundations. The GUIs are easy
to comprehend, and users need no knowledge of Csound or Python or even
music to start composing, jamming and making their own sounds.
</p><p>
Alas, there isn't space in this article to describe each program
in the suite fully, so I present each application briefly and advise
interested readers to listen to the XO audio demos I've posted at
linux-sound.org (see Resources). 
</p><p>
The TamTam Mini (Figure 2) is an introductory-level program for very
young users. The Mini is essentially a preset-style synthesizer played
with the computer's keyboard. Users select an instrument from the
display, and then play it by pressing the keys Z through M (lower octave) and
Q through I (higher octave). A drum set can be added to create a looping
play-along beat (with the start/stop button), and further controls
include sliders for master volume, tempo, beat complexity and number
of beats per bar. Sliders also are included for balance (that is, panning)
and a reverb effect. All controls are usable in real time, and users'
jams can be recorded for later playback. Finally, in accord with the XO's
design philosophy, Mini also supports collaborative play between multiple
machines, with all players synchronized to a shared beat. TamTam's Mini
may be simple in its operation, but it is a sophisticated learning
tool that succeeds at being instructional and fun&mdash;a winning design for
enticing children into learning more about music and sound.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10081f2.large.jpg"><img src="10081f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. TamTam Mini
</p></div></div><p>
The TamTam Jam (Figure 3) is the XO's main music performance activity. As
with the Mini, users select sounds from the display and play them
via the computer keyboard. A beatbox-style drum machine is available for
accompaniment grooves, and a sequencer is provided for recording phrases
played on the keyboard. Jam also is targeted at younger users, but it
is a much more sophisticated program. Polyphonic playing is supported,
and users have full control over the accompanying sequences and their
instrumentation. A virtual band can be formed with a drum set and up to
five instruments, and each instrument is coupled to a series of sequence
loops selected from the Loops display. These loops can be added or deleted
in real time, and right-clicking on the loop invokes its editor. The loop
editor controls the number of beats within the loop and its
&ldquo;regularity&rdquo;
(a randomization control), and a mini-piano roll editor lets users
redefine the notes and their order within the loop. It won't take long
before users realize that Jam is a powerful MIDI sequencer that can
make music in almost any style or degree of complexity.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10081f3.large.jpg"><img src="10081f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. TamTam Jam
</p></div></div><p>
TamTam's Edit (Figure 4) is a music composition/generation program that
can be employed as a more-or-less conventional five-track MIDI sequencer
or as a user-definable musical automaton. Beyond its transport controls,
Edit's toolset differs between its two modes. Compose mode includes
Select, Draw and Paint tools; volume and tempo sliders; and controls
for recording from the computer keyboard and saving your work as an
Ogg file. Generate mode includes only three tools, a Generate Tune
toggle and dialogs for the music generation parameters and for other
general properties of the sequence. The generation dialog has a 
cool interactive graphic interface for setting the conditions for each
generated event's rhythm, pitch and duration. Pitch material can be
defined further with selections from seven scales and four randomization
modes, any of which can be defined in real time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10081f4.large.jpg"><img src="10081f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. TamTam Edit 
</p></div></div><p>
Playback can be limited to a single sequence to create a real-time loop
composition environment. Sequences can be selected in noncontiguous
order with a Ctrl-left-click, although playback is always from left
to right. Hold and sweep with the same key combination selects multiple
continuous sequences.
</p><p>
Edit is an impressive toolkit for serious music composition, whether
in real time or off-line. I've worked with dozens of music generation
programs in text-based and graphic interfaces, and few of them are as
well designed as Edit. In software reviews, the word flexible is
usually overworked jargon, but it applies neatly to Edit. The program
supports a variety of approaches to music composition, from the strictly
deterministic to the utterly aleatoric, and it presents itself with an
interface that welcomes interactivity. Edit has its limits, but within
those limits, it is one of the coolest music programs I've used to date.
</p><p>
The TamTam SynthLab (Figure 5) is a sound design laboratory for advanced
students. According to the TamTam Wiki, the SynthLab is modeled on
the famous Max/MSP, a graphic environment for music composition and
multimedia development, but it reminds this reviewer of PatchWork,
an ancient editor for Csound instruments. In SynthLab, as in the older
program, icons representing synthesis primitives are wired together to
create a patch&mdash;that is, a new sound. SynthLab provides modules for sound
generation (FM, sample playback, granular synthesis), modulators (LFO,
envelopes) and effects processors (delay, reverb, chorus) that can be
wired together in arbitrary connections to create new sounds, all in
real time, of course. These sounds can be played on the computer keyboard
and/or saved to any of eight slots reserved for use in TamTam Mini.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10081f5.large.jpg"><img src="10081f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The TamTam suite is a great achievement, particularly when considered in
its hardware context. It certainly proves a point about efficient program
design, and there were many times when I forgot that the TamTam software
was doing its stuff on a machine with a 433MHz CPU. It also proves
a few other points about leveraging the power of contemporary Csound
and Python. Those languages have been developed for excellent real-time
performance, a factor well exploited by the TamTam programs. Vast thanks
and praise must go to Jean Piche, TamTam's master architect and to his
crew of talented developers for coming up with this most fascinating,
instructive and hugely fun group of activities and for giving it to the
children of the world. (And, yes, that includes children of all ages.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x1400958"></a>
Media Players</h2></div></div><p>
I knew that the XO was able to play media files in various formats,
but at first I was mystified as to how to access such files. The Sugar
interface doesn't provide a file manager a la Nautilus or Konqueror.
Instead, the Journal activity lists all work done on the machine in a
kind of diary. All saved work also is listed there, including recordings
and other media files, and I needed only to double-click on an item to
view or listen to it.
</p><p>
Players are invoked automatically for a selected file. On the base system,
I had no trouble playing MP3, Ogg and WAV audio with the players in the
eToys and Browser activities (Figure 6). I also played video files in AVI,
MPG and Ogg formats, with the understanding that playback was not likely
to be cinematic with a 433MHz CPU. However, videos made on the XO are
recorded at 30 frames per second and played smoothly (in their original
640x480 resolution) when transferred to my more powerful desktop machines.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10081f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x1400c70"></a>
Simple Recording</h2></div></div><p>
Audio recording on the XO is done with the Recorder activity, a simple
utility for capturing pictures, video and sound. After selecting the
particular media task, a &ldquo;ready to record&rdquo; icon appears (an eye for
video and lips for audio). Click the icon to start recording, and click 
it again to stop the process. The file is named and saved automatically,
and it can be previewed directly from the Recorder.
</p><p>
I tested the audio recorder with the internal microphone and with an
inexpensive external mic. To its credit, the internal mic recorded with
less noise and a stronger signal. I've since decided to do all casual
recording on the XO with its own microphone. Settings for the microphone
input level (and all other audio channel levels) can be managed with
alsamixer or any similar sound card mixer, but I found the default levels
to be adequate under relatively calm acoustic conditions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13f76b8"></a>
A Word about the Speakers</h2></div></div><p>
The XO's internal speakers are okay for basic purposes, but they
will not provide high-fidelity sound. For a better audio experience,
I suggest either good-quality headphones or a set of powered external
speakers. Surround sound playback is supported by the XO's audio chipset,
so you may want to attach a 5.1 system. Alas, I was unable to find
technical specifications on the integrated speakers, but it's obvious
on listening that bass response is almost nil, which gives the audio a
thin and tinny sound. This is especially unfortunate with regard to
the TamTam software&mdash;it simply sounds far better on external speakers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13f77c0"></a>
The Csound/Python Connection</h2></div></div><p>
Thanks to the pioneering work of Michael Gogins, Steven Yi and other
developers, Csound now includes a number of Python-related opcodes. Python
is rather ubiquitous in the XO's software structure, and Csound is the
audio engine for the machine, so it's a wrap that the XO might be an
excellent platform for experimentation with the world's most powerful
music and sound programming language. Alas, I've run out of space to
describe adequately the XO's Csound/Python potential in this article,
but I can recommend interested readers to the OLPC Wiki page on Csound. A
few pointers to relevant projects and activities can be found there,
and further information can be discovered in the Csound mailing list and
its archives. Jean Piche and Rick Boulanger are Csound gurus, so I have
great expectations for working with the language on this machine. If
TamTam is any indicator, the creative possibilities are truly impressive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1307580.0x13f7920"></a>
Critical Remarks</h2></div></div><p>
I loaned the machine to two students, both of whom had trouble figuring
out how to save their work. They discovered how to use the Recorder and
other activities with little difficulty, but the Save procedure was dark
to them until I explained the Journal and its functions. Documentation
is entirely Web-based, and the students said it was a hassle to switch
between the Web browser and their current activity. Of course, once they
learned how to use the Journal, all was well.
</p><p>
The only other problematic area for me was the wireless
connectivity. Connections are hard to come by in my area, and I would
have been happier with an Ethernet port. However, I understand the design
consideration, and my USB-to-Ethernet adapter is already on order.
</p><p>
If you've been waiting to purchase one machine for yourself or thousands
for children in the remoter parts of the globe, just do it. The XO is
intended to spread happiness and joy throughout the world, but the
project needs your help to achieve this lofty goal. See the OLPC Wiki
for more information on how you can get on board.
</p><p>
So, do I like the XO? I <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> this machine, and I heartily
recommend it to anyone anywhere. It squeezes more juice from a relatively
low-powered CPU than I would have thought possible, the TamTam software's
performance is nothing short of astonishing, and the fun factor scales
right off the charts. The XO gets five stars for overall excellence,
and if I had to choose a single word to describe the machine and
the experience of using it, that word would be joyous.
