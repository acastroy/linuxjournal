<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #170, June 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There have been some very interesting changes in the way the kernel is
developed lately. In a continuing effort to keep contributors enthusiastic
about participating in kernel development, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> announced he's
willing to accept <span   class="bold"><b>less-polished driver
code</b></span>. Actually, this affects code
throughout the kernel, but it particularly affects driver code, because if
a driver breaks, it probably won't cause problems anywhere else in the
kernel. There are several benefits to making this change. For one, as
Linus has pointed out, accepting code into the kernel makes it easier for
others to find bugs and submit fixes. Keeping code out means that the
developers must work more in isolation and get less help from those
potential contributors. Another benefit is that strict code submission
requirements can have a depressing effect on developers. In the
even/odd stable/unstable version-numbering days, developers went through a
lot of pain during the stable development cycle, because it's just more fun
to write new code than to fix bugs. The transition to the 2.6 kernel and to
a permanent phase of development meant that this recurring period of
frustration was gone. But, there was still a lot of focus on ensuring that
code was up to snuff before it could be accepted.
</p><p>
With the creation of the new stable series that did not interrupt 2.6
development but just ran alongside, the stage really has been set for some
kind of move like this from Linus for some time. But, there certainly
will be large repercussions during the coming months. For one, people who
have taken it upon themselves to keep the kernel clean, remove old code, fix
odd badness and so on will have a much tougher job of it now. <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span>
is one of these, but there are others as well, and it'll be harder for them
or anyone else to make the kind of progress they've been making lately.
</p><p>
Another repercussion has already occurred&mdash;the creation of the
<span   class="bold"><b>&ldquo;Linux Next&rdquo;
git tree</b></span>. It's a tree for subsystem maintainers to sync their code every
day, so that any conflicting patches are identified and resolved quickly.
The issue of subsystem conflicts actually has existed for a while now, but
Linus' new code-acceptance policies pushed <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> over the edge
and made him start asking for volunteers to maintain a &ldquo;Linux
Next&rdquo;-type
thing. The problem is that subsystem updates don't just touch code within
the subsystems themselves, they can include patches to many other parts of
the kernel. So, whenever Linus would open up a new merge window, there would
be many patch conflicts, and the maintainers would run around fixing them
before they could get their code in through the window. With the new easier
acceptance policies, this problem would have gotten worse. It was
already driving the subsystem maintainers crazy. Using Linux Next, they
merge their trees on a daily basis without having to wait for Linus, so all
conflicts are identified right away, and folks have more time to fix them,
instead of having to try to fix everything at the last minute, with no prior
knowledge of any breakage. With Linux Next, as soon as the merge window
opens, all the subsystem trees can be accepted into the main tree at once,
with far less hassle.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephen Rothwell</b></span> has volunteered to maintain the Linux Next tree, and so
far, dozens of subsystem maintainers have joined it. There still are plenty
of problems with Linux Next that need resolving. For example, the order
in which the trees are merged is significant, because any trees that give
conflicts will be rejected, and the maintainer of that tree will be
expected to fix the conflict. Because trees merging earlier are unlikely to
see any conflicts, as they merge against a more pristine tree, this
means that trees merging later will be arbitrarily responsible for fixing
the patch conflicts. Andrew's solution to this is to rank each subsystem by
importance and merge in that order. The question of which subsystems are
most important then becomes a political issue, with the potential for
in-fighting and bitterness. I expect some more elegant solution to
emerge, unless it turns out that subsystem rankings are very obvious to
everyone involved.
</p><p>
Andrew's larger goal with Linux Next is to increase visibility into the
code that goes into the kernel, so that Linus' new looser restrictions on
patch submissions still will allow kernel folks to scrutinize those
submissions after the fact, to identify what needs to be cleaned up and
decide where the most developer attention should be diverted. It's likely that
Andrew and others will continue coming up with ideas to implement this
increased visibility over time. In terms of the average Linux contributor,
however, Linus' new policies herald a new period of freedom, as well as
the chance for many of them to react to feedback from users, at a level
they may not have experienced previously.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Samuel Thibault</b></span> has written a driver for
the <span   class="bold"><b>VisioBraille</b></span> device. Because the
code is at the driver level and not in user space, it is intended, in this
case, to handle situations where user-space Braille drivers would not be
effective&mdash;for example, during boot failures. Early in the boot process,
user processes can't run, but blind users still might want to read the
failure messages and report bugs back to the kernel developers. The patch
itself is apparently fairly ugly, but Andrew Morton at least was unable to
find a way to improve it. It's likely to go into the kernel very soon.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Daniel Phillips</b></span> has written <span   class="bold"><b>Ramback</b></span>, a new virtual block device with the
speed of a RAM disk and the data persistence of a hard drive. Users see a
regular filesystem, but all file activity is done in RAM and then quietly
mirrored to a hard disk back end. Daniel has measured a 25-fold speed
increase with this approach. The gotchas all tend to center around how and
when the data migrates from RAM to the hard disk. Daniel's approach has
been to focus on the behavior during clean shutdowns and restarts, but
there is still a big gray area regarding what happens when the system
crashes. Daniel is very excited about the possibilities for a really fast
user experience, but acknowledges that there are still a lot of technical
problems, and that people shouldn't be storing their data in Ramback just yet,
unless they want to help debug and develop it. The biggest critic of
Daniel's patch seems to be <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, who questions whether a virtual device
even is needed. He suggests a simple RAM disk, with a user d&aelig;mon that
saves everything to disk on a periodic basis. So, it's unclear whether
Ramback will make it into the kernel. Although with Linus' new acceptance
policies, who knows?

<h2 class="title">Eee PC Gets an Upgrade</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #170, June 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
ASUS's little Eee PC notebook (or UMPC, Ultra-Mobile PC) computer, which
has sold hundreds of thousands of units since hitting the streets late last
year&mdash;and which ASUS expects to sell up to 5 million of in 2008&mdash;is
getting a bit more capable. At CeBIT in March, ASUS unveiled the Eee PC 900.
Improvements over the original (G4) include an 8.9" WSVGA (1024 x 600)
display (the original was 800 x 400 WVGA), 8GB or 12GB SSD storage (up from
4GB) and 1GB of RAM (up from 512KB). Other than that, everything else is
pretty much the same. It's still only two pounds, features three USB ports, card
readers, wireless (802.11b/g) and wired Ethernet, a Webcam and a claimed
battery life of up to four hours. It is due for release this summer,
reportedly at a price of 399 Euro, or whatever that costs in the US when
you read this. It's an increase over the original model price. That one, at
press time (March), was running mostly in the mid-$300 (US) range at
on-line stores. Oh, and they're &ldquo;Windows-ready&rdquo;, but that OS costs extra.
Linux still comes standard on the base model.

<h2 class="title">Bravia for the GPL</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #170, June 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A few months back, Peter Semelhack of Bug Labs mentioned to me that his new
Sony Bravia flat-screen TV came with some interesting paperwork: a
statement about GPL'd software. As it happened, we also own a Bravia flat-screen. Sure enough, when I looked at the pile of paperwork that came with
it, there was a large folded sheet covered with small type titled REQUIRED
PUBLIC STATEMENT FOR GPL/LGPL LICENSED SOFTWARE USED IN THIS TELEVISION.
Above almost four pages containing the full text of the GPL v.2 and
the LPGL v.2.1 licenses, Sony says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

Source code for these executables and libraries can be obtained using
the following link: <a href="http://www.sony.com/linux" target="_self">www.sony.com/linux</a>.

That link leads to a simple page with links to code behind four product

I bought our TV, a KDL-40XBR2, in November 2006, and found it in the 2006
list. When I click on that link, I get to the Open Source Code 06 section
of Sony's &ldquo;Open Source Code&mdash;English&rdquo; page. There, I see that my TV runs on
the ATI GTX Linux kernel, which is a blue link that starts downloading the
source code when I click on it.
</p><p>
I'm no hacker, so I probably won't do anything funky with our television.
(More capable friends are welcome, family permitting.) Instead, I'll sit
content to know there's one more Linux device in our house, and that
clearly we're moving toward GandhiCon IV. That's the last stage suggested
by Mohandas Gandhi's famous statement, &ldquo;First they ignore you, then they
laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Of course, if we've won, that means that Linux in the TV is a feature and
not a buried host for functions. How long before that happens?

<h2 class="title">What Are They Using?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #170, June 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I was celebrating Leap Day (February 29) at a London pub with Mark Antony
Kent, Head of Technology Strategy at British Telecom, hoping also to pump
his brain for insights to follow up on a contentious FCC hearing at Harvard
earlier that week&mdash;one convened to visit issues around Comcast's valving
of BitTorrent traffic. Mark is both a telecom and Internet veteran of long
standing, and he's full of exciting ideas about how to work around the
congestion issues that got Comcast into so much trouble.

</p><p>
In the midst of this, I learned that Mark was coincidentally a
veteran Linux hacker who also packed a lot of lightweight Linux iron around
with him. When he began pulling some of this stuff out and showing me what
it did, I pulled out my little Canon camera to record his ad hoc demo
(which later made a nice little podcast) and to document details I could
share here. In brief, here's the gear he talked about and how he uses it:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
EfficientPC generic Linux box. His came with a MythTV PCI card that comes
with its own digial TV tuner and a remote control. &ldquo;I just plugged it in
and it works&rdquo;, Mark said. Signals he picks up from the BBC and other
sources are recorded here, where he downcodes with...
</p></li><li><p>
MEnccoder, a free GPL'd command line tool for downloading, encoding and
filtering for video. The resulting files are then transferred to
his...
</p></li><li><p>
Nokia N800 UMPC (ultra-mobile PC). Here, he stores the shows on a Flash
card. The N800 has two slots for these, one inside and one on the bottom.
He uses one for video and the other for audio. He showed me a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Father
Ted</em></span>
show he had recorded, which the N800 organizes with the amazing...
</p></li><li><p>
Canola media center, which plays beautifully through MPlayer, complete
with stereo sound through its little speakers or through a headset. Mark
fills up several cards with video and does his telly watching on the train,
on a screen far bigger than that of, say, an iPhone. He records audio
directly from the FM tuner built in to the N800, or listens live. (The FM
radio is a feature sadly missing on the newer N810. Hope it comes back in
future versions.) He also stores both video and audio at home on a...
</p></li><li><p>
Excito Bubba media server, which runs on Debian with the 2.6 Linux
kernel. At home, his N800 sees the Bubba's Wi-Fi signal, from which Canola
can discover files using the DAAP and UPnP protocols, then list and play
them directly. He also has...
</p></li><li><p>
Two Nokia N770s, which are the predecessors to the N800. He liked them
so much that he just had to have two. &ldquo;Then, when (the N800) came out, I
wanted the radio. The 770s also run Canola and play everything from the
Bubba.&rdquo; Mark says, &ldquo;The 770 has a Samba server as well, which also increases
possibilities.&rdquo; Thanks to these lightweight items, he stopped hauling around
a laptop, and instead uses the N800 as his portable computer, thanks to a...
</p></li><li><p>
Bluetooth keyboard. At home, he also has...
</p></li><li><p>
Another Linux PC&mdash;&ldquo;an ASUS thing from the EfficientPC guys&rdquo;, with dual
flat-screen monitors. Back on the road, he also can get on the Net by
bluetoothing from his handhelds over a...
</p></li><li><p>
Motorola A780, which is coincidentally Linux-based as well and uses 2.5G
&ldquo;edge&rdquo; technology. He has also ordered an...
</p></li><li><p>
ASUS Eee PC for his son. &ldquo;He's a Mac guy&rdquo;, Mark said, but &ldquo;he saw this
and really, really wanted one&rdquo;. Mark is &ldquo;desperate to get one&rdquo; as well.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Mark's enthusiasm was infectious, and I caught the bug. After I flew back
home to the US the next morning, I immediately started to ramp up my own
version of Mark's portfolio of cool tools.

Purple Labs, a company based in France with a multinational management
team, is pushing Linux mobile phones outward in capabilities and downward
in price.

</p><p>
Positioned as &ldquo;the only independent software vendor with a complete Linux

&ldquo;replace their legacy RTOS with a flexible and scalable Linux platform,
accelerating development of feature-rich 3G phones while reducing
investment&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The latest of these is Purple Magic, which Purple Labs calls a &ldquo;reference
design&rdquo; for &ldquo;the 1st sub-$100 3G Linux feature phone&rdquo;. Features include
music playback, Internet browsing, video telephony and video streaming, in
addition to plain-old cell phone service.
</p><p>
And, as you can see from the picture, it doesn't look bad, either.

Some people think innovation in technology is about how hard it is to
implement, or how long it took, or how complex it is, or convoluted. They
see innovation as wizardry. I see it differently. I'm impressed by the
ratio of functionality to complexity. I like that number to be as big as
possible, because the less complex it is, the fewer moving parts, the less
likely it is to break, and the easier it will be for others to build on the
idea.
