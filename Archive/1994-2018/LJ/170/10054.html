An alternative e-mail client.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b6250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Zimbra Desktop is an alternative e-mail client. I don't mean 
that it is yet another choice in e-mail client-land. It
is more than merely another choice. Zimbra Desktop is an attempt to blur
the lines between a browser-based Web application and a traditional
desktop application. In many ways, it is similar to applications
like Evolution, Outlook or KMail&mdash;what Zimbra refers to as
&ldquo;fat&rdquo;
clients&mdash;but in other ways, it has more in common with browser-based
e-mail platforms, such as Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo mail. In a nutshell, Zimbra
Desktop is the Web-based Zimbra Ajax Web client running inside a custom
Prism install (for more about Prism, see the What Is Prism? sidebar).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b6460"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is Prism?</b></p><p>
Prism is a Mozilla Labs project. Its aim is to allow you to split
Web applications out of your browser and run them directly on your
desktop. In reality, it allows you to run your Web
application inside a stripped-down Firefox window, with no buttons or
bars to get in the way.
</p><p>
The reason this is useful is because of one of Firefox's design
decisions. In order to save on memory and processor usage, all of your
browser windows run under a single Firefox process. This generally works
well, except when Firefox crashes. Because of the design, a crash in one
Firefox window affects all other Firefox windows. Prism lets
you separate Web applications into their own processes. In
this way, they behave more like traditional desktop applications&mdash;for
example, if my Prism Gmail application dies, it doesn't affect the
other Web applications I have running or close the Web sites I currently
have open.
</p><p>
Development is ongoing, and new features are coming out all the time. For
example, a new plugin for Firefox 3 recently was released that allows
you to convert a Web site into a desktop application simply by clicking
Tools&rarr;Convert Website to Application.
</p><p>
More information about Prism is available at
<a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/featured-projects/#prism" target="_self">labs.mozilla.com/featured-projects/#prism</a>.
</p></div><p>
At first blush, I thought to myself, &ldquo;Why would someone want to do
this? What's the point?&rdquo; Well, the point, I came to discover, is that
desktop e-mail suites have certain advantages over browser-based e-mail
suites, and vice versa.
</p><p>
The main advantage desktop e-mail clients have over their browser-based
brethren, in my opinion,
is the ability to read saved e-mail when you
are not connected to the Internet. There is also, in corporate settings
especially, the advantage of integration with LDAP directory servers and
scheduling functions through shared calendars and the like. On the other
hand, the main advantage that browser-based e-mail clients
have over desktop e-mail clients is that they run exactly the same, or
very nearly the same, on multiple browsers and operating systems. There
also is no lengthy install process; you simply go to the site and there
it is. The aim of Zimbra Desktop is to give you the best of both worlds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b68d8"></a>
Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, because Zimbra Desktop acts like a traditional application,
there is an installer. The installer itself is an approximately 40MB shell
script. Actually, it is a 340-line shell script cat'ed to an approximately
40MB
tar.gz file. The script extracts the tar.gz file from itself,
gunzips and untars it, and then runs the Java-based installer that lives
inside. This sort of installation bootstrapping, by extracting a file
stored inside a shell script, is something commercial Linux software
seems to prefer doing, and I have to say, it does work.
</p><p>
The GUI installer is nothing special. It uses install4j, and it gets the
job done.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10054f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Zimbra Desktop Installer
</p></div></div><p>
At the end of the installation process, you'll have a zimbra folder wherever
you instructed the installer to put it. The home folder of the user that
performed the install is the default location. Optionally, you also will
have a desktop icon, if you did not uncheck the Create Desktop
Shortcut box.
</p><p>
Double-click the desktop icon, and Zimbra Desktop launches and prompts
you to enter in the settings for an e-mail account of your choosing. Zimbra
Desktop supports Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS), Gmail, Yahoo Mail
Plus and standard POP and IMAP accounts. I tested with Gmail and ZCS,
as those are what I have.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b6ca0"></a>
E-mail on Zimbra Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
The initial sync of my Gmail account took about an hour from start to finish. I
just left it alone while it downloaded my mail. I didn't have much mail
in my ZCS account, so that sync was almost instantaneous.
</p><p>
Using Zimbra Desktop reminds me a lot of using Evolution or
Thunderbird. You can drag and drop e-mail messages from one folder to another,
right-click on single messages or groups of messages and perform various
actions (such as forward, filter, tag, mark as read or unread and so on), and
you can do
many of the other things that you would expect. It was easy to forget
that the entire interface is built using HTML and JavaScript.
</p><p>
The e-mail composer has all the features I expect from a modern client. You
can compose in HTML or plain-text format, and in HTML mode,
you have all of the usual control over fonts, lists, colors, text size
and so on.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f2.large.jpg"><img src="10054f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Zimbra Desktop composer window offers all the features you
would expect.
</p></div></div><p>
The e-mail viewing interface has the familiar three-pane view that most
clients default to, and the HTML e-mail messages I used for testing rendered the same
as in other clients.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f3.large.jpg"><img src="10054f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Zimbra Desktop has no trouble rendering HTML e-mail messages.
</p></div></div><p>
On the whole, using Zimbra Desktop is quite plain. 
It feels like what I'm used to with standard &ldquo;fat&rdquo; desktop
mail clients. The interface is easy to navigate around, and things are
generally about where I expect them to be, and when I
wanted more information, the integrated help system was very useful.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f4.large.jpg"><img src="10054f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Help is just a click away.
</p></div></div><p>
One of the biggest differences between Zimbra Desktop and a standard
client is that there aren't the normal File, Edit, View, Search
(and so on) drop-down menus arranged into a nice menu bar. This is not
a limitation as such, it's just different. In normal, everyday use,
I didn't miss them.
</p><p>
One of my favorite features in Zimbra Desktop (which is also one of my
favorite things about Gmail) is the extensive availability of keyboard
shortcuts. In fact, many of the key combinations are similar, if not
the same, so I quickly felt at home. This is something fat clients could
learn from their browser-based cousins&mdash;easy keyboard shortcuts, such
as
pressing J to move down in the list of messages and K to move up, are great
time-savers. The complete list of shortcuts is available under
Preferences&rarr;Shortcuts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f5.large.jpg"><img src="10054f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Zimbra Desktop has a lot of shortcuts.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b7748"></a>
Calendaring</h2></div></div><p>
The calendaring component of Zimbra Desktop is very nice. It's much better,
in my opinion, than Google Calendar, if not quite as good as some of the
other desktop calendar apps I have used.
</p><p>
You can create appointments by a click and drag on the calendar, and
you can move appointments by selecting them with the mouse and moving
them where you want. You can create new calendars simply by clicking the
New Calendar button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f6.large.jpg"><img src="10054f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Zimbra Desktop can subscribe to remote ical calendars.
</p></div></div><p>
The shared calendars and scheduling features work only with ZCS accounts,
so keep that in mind if you are thinking of using Zimbra Desktop in a
multi-user setting.
If you are using Zimbra Desktop with an e-mail account other than ZCS,
the calendar works like a standard desktop calendar. You also
can subscribe to shared ical calendars.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b7ab8"></a>
Address Book</h2></div></div><p>
As far as the address book goes, it's an address book. If you're using
ZCS, you likely will have access to a shared address book. There's nothing
special here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19b7bc0"></a>
Zimlets</h2></div></div><p>
One thing that Zimbra Desktop has that other clients don't are
Zimlets. Because the Zimbra Desktop's entire interface is based on HTML
and JavaScript, it makes sense to include other pieces of on-line content
into the client, and Zimlets are what allow this. Included with Zimbra
Desktop are Yahoo Maps and Yahoo Local Zimlets. More Zimlets are
available at <a href="http://gallery.zimbra.com" target="_self">gallery.zimbra.com</a> that can do things like track
flights and add support for Flickr to the e-mail composing window, but
installing them is nowhere near as easy as say, installing a Firefox
extension, and if anything, they should be easier to install. They're
a neat idea though, and they enable functionality that you just can't get in
traditional e-mail clients.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f7.large.jpg"><img src="10054f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Zimlets are a nice way to extend your e-mail interface.

What I Don't Like</h2></div></div><p>
On the whole, I was impressed with Zimbra Desktop. But, there were some
things I really didn't like. As Zimbra Desktop is in beta,
take these criticisms with a big grain of salt, because they might have
disappeared by the time you read this.
</p><p>
Setting Zimbra Desktop to connect to my Gmail account was an easy
process, but using it was not so easy. When connecting to Gmail via IMAP,
your Gmail labels show up as folders, and the first time you click on
any folder other than the Inbox you get a &ldquo;This folder is currently
not syncing. Click here to sync this folder&rdquo; message. This is silly,
because if I did not want to view the messages in the folder, I would
not have clicked on the folder. The very action of me clicking on the
folder indicates that I want to sync the folder, so there is no need to
ask me. In addition to this, after you click on the link, you are sent
back to the Inbox for some reason. Clicking on the folder again finally
gets you the folder you wanted. Three clicks just to view one folder
seems excessive, and the effort involved in getting my entire Gmail tree
syncing was unnecessary. I will grant that I have a lot of labels, and
thus, a lot of folders, but Zimbra Desktop could have been smarter with
its default behavior.
</p><p>
Another annoyance is that in the Zimbra Desktop interface you can 
view only one account at a time. Because of this, dragging e-mail from one
account to another one is impossible, as far as I can tell.
</p><p>
Each account also has its own calendar and contact list. I have a
work e-mail and a few personal e-mail accounts, and both work and home
calendars. In Zimbra Desktop, there does not appear to be a way to view
all contacts from all accounts at the same time. Ditto for calendars.
</p><p>
Another minor quibble about the calendar is this: because I'm using
Zimbra Desktop with my Gmail account, when I saw the calendar,
I thought to myself, &ldquo;hey, this probably will sync in both directions
to my Google Calendar&rdquo;. It doesn't. Zimbra Desktop can read and show
your Google Calendar by subscribing to the ical link you can get from
Google Calendar, but it is read-only. The writeable calendar is only in
Zimbra Desktop. I suppose I can't complain too much, as Zimbra never
said the calendar would sync with Google Calendar, but I'm still
sad it doesn't. Maybe in a future version?
</p><p>
On the topic of missing functionality, I was not able to get the touted
off-line capabilities working with either Gmail or the ZCS server I set
up for testing. I tested the feature simply by unplugging my computer
from the network and then launching Zimbra Desktop. Instead of showing
my e-mail messages, I received a message stating that the document could not
be displayed in front of a blank window. This should improve with future
releases and may well be fixed by the time this article is published.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10054f8.large.jpg"><img src="10054f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. This error message would be more useful if there were a File menu
in Zimbra Desktop, but there isn't.
</p></div></div><p>
There also is a d&aelig;mon that must be running for Zimbra Desktop to
start. If it is not running, you'll get an error message.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10054f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. The zdesktop d&aelig;mon must be running for Zimbra Desktop to
work.
</p></div></div><p>
This d&aelig;mon lives at zimbra/zdesktop/zdesktop and must be launched
with a single <tt  >start</tt> argument. The installer does tell you about it,
but it does not set it to start automatically, so in order to make sure
it was always running when I was logged in, I created a Startup Program
entry for it. This is a small annoyance, and one that hopefully will be
automated in a future version of the installer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10054f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. A simple startup entry ensures that zdesktop starts whenever I
log in.
</p></div></div><p>
One final thing to be aware of when using Zimbra Desktop with Gmail that
I found is annoying is that if an e-mail does not have a label assigned
to it and it is not in the Inbox, you won't be able to see it. So
if you plan on using this with Gmail, label everything.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19af1b8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Will I be ditching other e-mail clients and switching over to using
Zimbra Desktop full-time? In a word, no. Zimbra Desktop is a very nice
e-mail client. It has the features I expect a modern client to have, it
can handle multiple accounts easily, and everything is rolled up into a
nice easy-to-install package. But being &ldquo;just as good&rdquo; as other e-mail
clients is not enough to make me switch. Even the coolness of Zimlets
is not enough.
</p><p>
The integration of Zimbra Desktop with the Zimbra Collaboration Suite is,
naturally, very good, and if I were using ZCS as my primary mail server,
the choice to use Zimbra Desktop would be obvious. I would. And,
that is, I suppose, my final recommendation. If you are using ZCS,
Zimbra Desktop lets you access your messages, contacts and calendars
even when you're off-line (that's the promise, anyway), and you can use
it for all of your other e-mail accounts too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18be580.0x19af370"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Zimbra Collaboration Suite</b></p><p>
The documentation for Zimbra Desktop states that you have to have a
Zimbra Collaboration Suite (ZCS) to connect to. This is not technically
true, as you can use Zimbra Desktop with Gmail, Yahoo mail or any POP
or IMAP server without a ZCS in sight. However, the integration with
Zimbra server is, naturally, very strong, so if you run your own
e-mail server, the ZCS + Zimbra Desktop combination is very compelling.
</p><p>
One of the main benefits of running ZCS as your e-mail server is that
the installation is easy when you compare it to setting up your
typical SMTP + IMAP + ClamAV + LDAP server installation.
</p><p>
ZCS comes in both a commercial Network edition and an open-source
Community edition. Both have excellent documentation, which is great
help in getting it up and running.
</p><p>
More information on the Network edition is available at
<a href="http://www.zimbra.com/products" target="_self">www.zimbra.com/products</a>.
And, more information on the Community edition is available at
<a href="http://www.zimbra.com/community" target="_self">www.zimbra.com/community</a>.
</p></div><p>
Even if you do not use ZCS, you still might want to give it a try. The
download and install process is easy, and you'll be up and running
quickly. I think you'll find, as I did, that alternatives, such as Evolution,
Thunderbird or Gmail work equally as well, and that there is no compelling
reason to move away from what you are already using&mdash;in which case, there
is a nice uninstaller.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10054f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. If Zimbra Desktop is not for you, there is a handy uninstaller
located in the zimbra folder.
</p></div></div><p>
But, then again, maybe you'll love it and never want to use a traditional
e-mail client again.
