An open-source angle on Nick Carr's latest book.

I've always liked Nicholas Carr, even when I didn't agree with him. He's a
clear thinker, a solid writer, a fearless partisan for sanity and a member
of nobody's cabal. His landmark 2003 article, &ldquo;IT Doesn't
Matter&rdquo;, was voted
the best of that year by the staff of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Harvard Business
Review</em></span>. In 2004,
Nick expanded that article into the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Does IT
Matter?</em></span>. He followed in
2005 with &ldquo;The End of Corporate Computing&rdquo;, in <span   class="emphasis"><em>MIT
Sloan Management Review</em></span>.
As usual, few reviewers agreed with him. Including me.
</p><p>
His main point: IT functions were turning into &ldquo;commodity
inputs&rdquo; developed
outside of IT organizations and becoming profoundly generic. He added that
IT was declining in strategic importance within organizations, and instead
was doomed to perform purely functional roles. From the Preface to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Does IT
Matter?</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
IT's transformation from a set of proprietary and heterogeneous systems
into a shared and standardized infrastructure is a natural, necessary, and
healthy process. It is only by becoming an infrastructure&mdash;a common
resource&mdash;that IT can deliver its greatest economic and social
benefits.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I didn't see how much this thesis had in common with my own observations
about open-source development until I read Nick's latest book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Big
Switch: Rewiring the World, from Edison to Google</em></span>. In it, Nick stays on the
supply side of technology, detailing the sources of IT's&mdash;and
everybody's&mdash;commodity inputs from pure utility service providers: Google/YouTube,
Amazon, Skype and PlentyofFish. He sees good and bad in the trends. For
example, although he agrees with some observations in Lewis Hyde's classic
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property</em></span> and Yochai Benkler's more
recent <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wealth of Networks</em></span>, he also dismisses their optimism:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...there's a naivet&eacute;, or at least a short-sightedness, to these
arguments as well. The utopian rhetoric ignores the fact that the market
economy is rapidly subsuming the gift economy. The &ldquo;gifts of time and
ideas&rdquo; are becoming inputs to the creation of commodities...businesses are
using the masses of Internet gift givers as a global pool of cut-rate
labor.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Yet, there is more to a gift economy than the charity implied by the g-word.
As Eric S. Raymond put it in &ldquo;Homesteading the
Noosphere&rdquo;:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Abundance makes command relationships difficult to sustain and exchange
relationships an almost pointless game. In gift cultures, social status is
determined not by what you control but by what you give away....
</p><p>
This abundance creates a situation in which the only available measure
of competitive success is reputation among one's peers.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Eric's essay appeared on the Web in 1998. At that time, the LAMP stack was
still four letters long. Now that stack is a pile that exceeds a half-million code bases. Most of that code was produced originally for very
practical reasons: to solve a problem, to add a capability, to get some
work done&mdash;or, in hacker parlance, to &ldquo;scratch an itch&rdquo;. Those code bases
are what organizations, including companies large and small, use to build
countless new &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; and businesses. What they benefit from is less
the value of gifting and peer esteem than the value of re-usability, which
matters not only to hackers but also to anybody who wants to save money and
time.
</p><p>
Peer-built commodity code has given us re-usability out the wazoo. In fact,
we have so much of it that the builder of anything technical has to cope
with a surfeit of free loose parts, as if sitting in a vast bin of Lego
pieces, all seemingly from different sets&mdash;a little Star Fighter here, a
little Train Station there, a lot of who-knows-what&mdash;all of it useful, or
it wouldn't have been made in the first place.
</p><p>
It is usefulness that lies behind the creation, expansion and ubiquitizing
of what Nick calls the World Wide Computer. If it weren't for the LAMP
heap, we would not have the scale of freeness and abundance required to
scale up a Flickr, an Amazon Web Service or a Google Cloud Computer.
</p><p>
Consistent with Nick's prophesies, I've been hearing lately about troubles
in IT-land. It seems that the gears where IT meets HR are stripped by the
independence of what Peter Drucker prophetically called Knowledge
Workers. It seems these workers are getting, and sharing, most of their
knowledge through commoditized external services outside of IT's control. I
know one company where the internal IT system is so locked-down and
firewalled against usefulness that employees in one division are getting
most of their work done on their own computers, with their own cell phones,
using utility &ldquo;social networking&rdquo; services from Twitter and Facebook.
</p><p>
There is a natural tendency, of course, to imagine utopian scenarios for
the future of the Net. Being an natural optimist, I have gone overboard in
that direction more than once&mdash;and have been called on it by Nick
himself, repeatedly. What still gives me hope, however, even after I
discount my own optimism, is the almost brutally meritocratic and practical
nature of open-source goods production, and the abundance of smart sources
from which they come.
</p><p>
I don't see utopian ideals behind what Alvin Toffler called the Information
Age (in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Third Wave</em></span>, which came out in 1980). Rather, I see practical
ones, modeled on the construction industry, complete with
&ldquo;architects&rdquo;,
&ldquo;designers&rdquo; and &ldquo;builders&rdquo;. The difference is in the
materials. In the physical
world, we are bound by the laws of physics and the periodic table. In the
networked world, we are bound by what the human mind can produce. We have
no equivalents of rock and wood, because our raw materials are far less
limited and far more abundant than both. This creates new problems and
opportunities in equal profusion.
</p><p>
But, for better and worse, the source is us.
