<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>: a computer in graceful, self-contained
form. Laptops are small, wireless, resource-minimal and portable.
You can take them wherever you go and hide them when not in use&mdash;no
ugly computer to occupy space. The LCD flat screen displays are
clearer and cleaner than cathode ray tube monitors (with less
brain-wave-zeroing effect), and the keyboards are small and quiet.
Even without portability, laptops have many advantages over desktop
machines.
</p><p>Laptops also have their shortcomings, the most obvious of
which is price. Laptops are <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> expensive and
difficult to repair or upgrade, although it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be done. They also offer inferior
performance compared to desktop machines, specifically in disk
access, processor speed and hardware support. Hard disks on laptops
spin slowly and are loathe to accelerate or decelerate; hence, disk
operations can be very slow, especially random accesses. Take a
look at the Bonnie benchmarks (see Table 2) to see just how slow.
Processors are also slower and more expensive. One reason is
laptops have relatively poor ventilation (making them quiet), so if
you have too many megahertz/gates/volts on the chip/CPU, it will
get too hot. (Notice the popularity of StrongARM processors in
machines without powerful fans, for example the NetWinder and
Empeg.) Also, laptop processors are physically different from
standard processors because they must be small and low-profile,
although smaller chips require less voltage so they don't generate
as much heat.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x1ebece8"></a>LinuxLaptops Attache</h2></div></div><p></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x1ebedf0"></a>The Good</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Debian GNU/Linux</p></li><li><p>Entirely free software</p></li><li><p>Flexible, loose</p></li><li><p>Superb console mode</p></li><li><p>Highly tuned, fast</p></li><li><p>Well customized</p></li><li><p>14.1" LCD screen is clear, flicker-free</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x1ebf3c8"></a>The Bad</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>GNOME/Enlightment is a tad slow, sometimes

providers are LinuxLaptops and ASL Workstations. LinuxLaptops is a
specialty shop run by Nathan Myers, which deals exclusively in
laptops for Linux and has three models at the moment. It is highly
focused on optimization and tuning, working within the interesting
limitations of laptop hardware, to maximize Linux performance. ASL
Workstations, on the other hand, is a successful Linux workstation
builder which provides many excellent workstations and makes its
AS-LT300 laptop as a logical component in a complete product line
of high-powered, server-oriented machines. Penguin Computing is
also developing a laptop, but it is still in beta and was not
available for review. VA Linux Systems, the best-known Linux
machine maker, has discontinued laptops for the time being.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3766f1.large.jpg"><img src="3766f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The Laptops
</p></div></div><p>Since only enormous firms have their own laptop factories,
laptop providers for Linux buy standard laptops and configure them
for Linux. Incidentally, the AS-LT300 and Attache are both ChemBook
7400s. Internally, they have slightly different configurations, but
the most significant difference is between their respective Linux
setups. Table 1 shows the more relevant features of the laptops
sent to <i  >LJ</i>, but keep in mind that you have
much flexibility in configuration if you order a laptop for
yourself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x1ebfa50"></a>Table 1.

well it worked. Nowadays, people have these funny ideas; they'd
like to be comfortable while using their machines and not get
headaches, neck cramps, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome,
radiation sickness, etc. Laptops win on most counts, the only
problem being that tall people may be made to suffer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x1eb84e8"></a>Monitors</h2></div></div><p>The LCD flat screens on these laptops are pristine and clear:
images are sharp and detailed, without glare, fuzziness, or
flicker. There are exactly 1024x768 pixels on the screens (unlike
CRT monitors, which often haven't got enough phosphors for the high
resolutions they &ldquo;support&rdquo;). While laptop monitors are not as
lovely as the extraordinarily expensive LCD flat panels, they have
remarkable clarity and accurate color. And, they consume very
little power while emitting hardly any electromagnetic radiation.
Ever since these laptops arrived, I haven't touched my desktop
computers, preferring instead to use
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> to log in from the
laptops.</p><p>Both monitors are identical, 14.1-inch Active Matrix TFT
(thin film transistor) panels. The ASL looked a tiny bit better in
X, while the Attache looks significantly better in console mode.
The reason for this is the Attache has been configured with a
frame-buffer device, so the console shows up in 1024x768 instead of
the usual 640x400. This means the screen can fit 48 rows and 128
columns of crystal-clear text (literally), as opposed to the usual
25 rows by 80 columns in 640x400 mode (which will appear ghosted on
a laptop). LCD screens look proper only in their ideal resolution,
so a monitor made for 1024x768 will be clear only in this mode and
should stay there all the time to take advantage of the excellent
image quality. If you are a console enthusiast, LinuxLaptops'
frame-buffer-enabled kernels which run the console in 1024x768 are
the only way to go.</p><p>The main disadvantage of LCD screens, other than expense, is
they have particular viewing angles; if you look from the wrong
angle, the colors and brightness will be off. Also, the screens are
very delicate, so you can't get mad and punch your monitor. One
shouldn't press on the screen at all, so it takes a concerted
effort to clean. If you buy a laptop off the shelf and try to
install Linux, configuring X will be a challenge. Finally, if you
are slightly taller than average, you might develop neck and back
pain from hunching over, since the keyboard is fixed so close to
the monitor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x1eb86f8"></a>Keyboards</h2></div></div><p>The ChemBook 7400 keyboard is a compact arrangement of
full-size keys which are perky and shallow. You don't have to push
down very far, so typing should conceivably be faster. One problem
with these keyboards is they sit far back in the laptop, leaving a
big surface in the way, and this usually results in the user
resting his or her wrists on the laptop. After about thirty minutes
of typing away while resting my wrists on the laptop, I feel a
horrible throbbing pain which follows me around all day; I suspect
this is what carpal tunnel syndrome feels like. So during the time
I have been using only laptops for their nice monitors, I have also
been using an external keyboard. Still, the key action on the
laptop keyboard is fast, and LinuxLaptops even took the effort to
remap <b  >CAPS LOCK</b> to serve as the
<b  >CTRL</b> key.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21cbe50"></a>Pointer Device</h2></div></div><p>Truthfully, I think track balls and little red joysticks are
neat, but these days the typical pointer is a pad which one runs a
finger across, inspiring the pointer to move accordingly. The pad
is easy to get accustomed to, and the movement is logical and
straightforward. The mouse buttons are two wide buttons situated
below the pad. Clicking both at once will emulate the third button,
but these days we should just have three buttons. Also, tapping on
the pad often acts as a mouse click, and this leads to some funny
accidents, especially on the Web.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21cbf58"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>The fundamental difference between the AS-LT300 and the
Attache is that the AS-LT300 is a Red Hat system, whereas the
Attache is a Debian system. Although distributions are usually
fairly similar, especially when one gets past installation, these
two are essentially polar opposites. Red Hat, as we know, is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>market</em></span> leader, the epitome of commercial
Linux, while Debian GNU/Linux is a vanguard of the free-source
philosophy, and typically the hacker's favorite setup. Herein lies
the difference in the feel of these laptops: ASL went the
commercial route, while LinuxLaptops took the expressly
non-commercial route.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21cc0b8"></a>X</h2></div></div><p>ASL includes the Accelerated X-Server, while LinuxLaptops
runs the standard XFree86. According to Xi Graphics, there is
usually a 40% to 60% performance improvement gained from running
the commercial servers, as well as support for many more cards. I
have not noticed any visible advantage; GNOME/Enlightenment is slow
on both laptops. Nevertheless, if you do graphics-intensive work,
there may be a benefit here. Both laptops use the ATI 3D Pro LT
card, so the graphics performance is similar. Neither in X nor in
console mode did I notice the lagging, slow updates associated with
LCD screens of the past. Graphics on both are superb.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21cc1c0"></a>The Good</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Well stocked, fully loaded</p></li><li><p>KDE or GNOME</p></li><li><p>Faster X server</p></li><li><p>Complete, functional laptop for Linux</p></li><li><p>Clear, flicker-free 14.1" LCD monitor</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21cc638"></a>The Bad</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Console mode is ghosty</p></li><li><p>Disk access a bit slow</p></li><li><p>Has some unnecessary software</p></li><li><p>Very expensive</p></li></ul></div><p>The window manager situation is a bit different. The AS-LT300
offers a choice between KDE and GNOME, and the Attache uses
GNOME/Enlightenment. While the Attache's devotion to
GNOME/Enlightenment (which <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> well configured)
keeps good faith with the open-software movement, the window
manager and desktop environment are a tad too resource-intensive
for a mid-range laptop, not to mention being unstable and slightly
buggy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21ccab0"></a>Sound</h2></div></div><p>As is typical of Linux, audio support is a mess. The Attache
awaits the release of the free sound driver, so other than beeps
(which you can mercifully turn off with a volume control), you
don't have audio support. The AS-LT300 has OSS audio support, which
means you can play CDs, but the audio devices are not set up
properly so you'll miss out on mpegs and the like (I expect ASL has
fixed by now). Still, the microphone appears to be working, because
at full volume, the machine starts generating horrible feedback
when I type. What to do about MIDI? Might as well get a hardware
sequencer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21ccbb8"></a>Network</h2></div></div><p>Network support on both laptops is fine and simple. All you
have to do is plug an Ethernet/Modem card into the PCMCIA slot,
edit the network files (five minutes tops), reboot, and your system
will be completely on-line. Networking is transparent and I even
swapped the network card in and out of the computers while running
and without any disastrous effects. The network card gets
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> hot, though; I worry it will melt. It
would be preferable to have Ethernet/modem built into the laptop
instead of using a PCMCIA card, since it looks less graceful to
have this gizmo sticking out of the laptop's side.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21ccd18"></a>Benchmarks</h2></div></div><p>Benchmarks are good general indicators of system performance,
but they're often misleading and not entirely relevant. It is true
these laptops do not compare well performance-wise to desktop
machines or servers, especially in terms of disk access, but then,
these laptops are not servers and servers are not particularly
portable. Laptops are generally one- or two-user machines and will
not be called on to do anything resource-intensive. As for disk
access, you don't need a super fast drive if you won't have several
dozen users reading and writing all at once, and you don't need too
many megahertz or that much RAM to run vi or Emacs. Multimedia
would be the one area for which a single user would need
supercomputing power, but then multimedia support on Linux is not
outstanding. So, Table 2 shows the Bonnie and BYTEmark results. The
AS-LT300 shipped with a faster processor (and higher price tag) so
its processor results are slightly better, while LinuxLaptops has
spent much effort tuning for hard-drive performance, hence the
better results here. I set both laptops to &ldquo;Suspend to RAM&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Large Filesystem&rdquo;, and ran the benchmarks several times for best
results. Bonnie's results fell into a broad range, due partially to
variance in access speed depending on the location of the data on
the disk. Laptop drives tend to be single speed, so the farther in
you go, the slower your access speed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x21cce20"></a>Table 2.

Attache even includes a tiny DOS partition for the emulator, but
included neither the correct file-system module for the new kernel
nor an entry in fstab or mtab. I think both laptops have a slightly
odd partition setup, with too much swap (256MB on the Attache,
128MB on the AS-LT300). Table 3 is a short file-system table so you
can see how they're set up for Linux, a bit systematic for what is
presumably a single-user system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc6580.0x244c7d8"></a>Table 3.

Linux. There are too many peculiarities and quirks of the hardware,
and drivers are hard to come by. The best anyone can hope for in
the near future is that everything will work after a bit of fixing.
I would expect LinuxLaptops to lead the way, with ASL and the
others adopting those ideas which turn out well. We don't have
Linux-specific laptop factories, and we don't have perfect support
for all the hardware. Laptops for Linux are coming, and hopefully
some day they will be as completely functional as desktop boxes.
Right now, they lack audio and some video support (svgalib, for
example). These laptops do have PCMCIA slots, infrared ports, disk
and CD-ROM (optional DVD) drives, and some potential for expansion.
Check the web sites for the full technical details.</p><p>Now that players have entered the Linux laptop market, we're
going to see quality go up and price go down, though there are many
options to buying a Linux laptop. If you need just a portable
machine with little computing power, you could get an inexpensive
or used laptop and install Linux. If you want the flat screen
monitor, you could buy one (I think they are worth the reduced eye
strain and radiation); Xi Graphics already has some drivers
available. If you want a small computer, pair your flat panel
display with a NetWinder and Happy Hacking Keyboard Lite. If you
need a laptop but don't like either of these, you could try one of
LinuxLaptops' other models (the Paquet looks exceedingly cute).
Also, you could wait until we move on to 64-bit RISC technology
(one x86 is enough, eh?). If you are buying only one computer, and
you live in an apartment which you'd like to look nice (i.e., no
ugly CRTs), or if you travel and need your computer, these laptops
have much to offer. The choice between our review subjects should
be easy. By now, you must know if you're a Red Hat (AS-LT300)
person or a Debian (Attache) person, although realistically,
LinuxLaptops has made a more highly tuned machine for the price.
Either way, how can you go wrong putting Linux on a computer,
especially one as cool as a laptop?</p></div></div>
