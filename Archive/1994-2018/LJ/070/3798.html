operating system that supports each presidential candidate's
official web site. Can you guess who runs on what? Let's take a
look. (Cue the drum roll...)</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Running on Windows NT or Windows 98: Republicans
Gary Bauer and George W. Bush, Democrat Al Gore and Reform Party
candidate Pat Buchanan. All serve pages with Microsoft IIS.</p></li><li><p>Running on Solaris: Democrat Bill Bradley and
Republicans Steve Forbes, Orrin Hatch and Alan Keyes. All but
Forbes use an Apache web server. Forbes uses
Netscape-Enterprise.</p></li><li><p>Running on BSD: Libertarian Harry Browne. Uses
Apache.</p></li><li><p>Running on IRIX: Republican John McCain. Uses
Rapidsite.</p></li><li><p>Finally (intensify that drum roll), running on
Linux: Independent candidate Bob Smith and Reform Party candidate
Donald Trump (arguably the poorest and richest guys in the race).

than Donald B. Marti, former proprietor of Electric Lichen and now
a Technical Marketing Manager with VA Linux Systems. Don is a gonzo
marketer of the highest order. Talk about starting fires; Don is
the guy who discovered the silly Unisys patent on the .GIF
compression algorithm, made a lovely stink about it, then staged
&ldquo;Burn all GIFs Day&rdquo;, along with a web site
(<a href="http://www.burnallgifs.org" target="_self">http://www.burnallgifs.org/</a>)
to coordinate and commemorate the event.
</p><p>Don was also a prime mover behind &ldquo;Windows Refund Day&rdquo;, and
he's the skilled hacker behind one of the Web's great memes: the
operating system sucks-rules-o-meter
(<a href="http://srom.zgp.org" target="_self">http://srom.zgp.org/</a>).</p><p>More than a great incendiary, Don is a revolutionary thinker.
Here are just two lines he dropped in a recent conversation:</p><p>&ldquo;Now it's time to hack the real world and let other people
write web sites about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Sucks-Rules-O-Meter is the first crude attempt to do
the opposite of advertising&mdash;in which the customers do the writing
and the supplier does the reading.&rdquo;</p><p>Here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we are adopting
the sucks-rules system to keep tabs on what people really say about
the various Linux distributions Hey, it's too good a hack not to

MESSAGING</h2></div></div><p>While Microsoft and AOL were joined in an Instant Messaging
(IM) &ldquo;war&rdquo; last fall, the open-source development community did
what it does best. It hacked together a working alternative that
outdoes both rivals by doing what neither party seems to know how
to do: work with everybody else for the benefit of not just the
customer, but the whole marketplace.</p><p>The project is Jabber. Think of Jabber as the Linux of
Instant Messaging. Then think of Jeramie Miller as the Linus
Torvalds of Jabber. About two years ago, Miller became annoyed with
the popular but inflexible and proprietary messaging systems from
AOL and Mirabilis (since bought by AOL), and came up with the idea
for an instant-messaging system that would be open and able to do
things the other systems could not, such as keep up with multiple
clients running at once.</p><p>Just as it happened with Linux, a devoted group of developers
and users quickly joined in and got to work. Using XML, they
created a &ldquo;transport&rdquo; between any and all IM platforms. Among
other things. <span   class="emphasis"><em>osOpinion</em></span> calls it &ldquo;the end of
instant messaging as we know it&rdquo;.</p><p>At the most practical level, this means users of AIM (AOL
Instant Messaging), ICQ (AOL's own alternative) and Microsoft's new
messaging system will all be reconciled by a new, independent,
open-source IM platform. It also means Linux users, still ignored
by AOL and Microsoft, can not only participate in the
instant-messaging movement, but clear its evolutionary path as
well.</p><p>Looking ahead on that same path are at least two commercial
companies: Webb Interactive Services and Corel. Webb's president is
Perry Evans, perhaps best known for creating Mapquest a few years
back. Mr. Evans liked Jabber so much he hired Mr. Miller for
similar reasons as Transmeta hired Mr. Torvalds. Webb and Corel are
now partnering to include Jabber in Corel's new Linux distribution,
among other things.</p><p>To join the Jabber development conversation, or to

company took a tack toward Linux with its new Linux Bridge product,
and acquired a technology patent protecting its whole Bridge series
of products. These products allow users to operate applications on
other platforms&mdash;essentially using those platforms' workstations as
terminals for applications run on servers elsewhere. GraphOn also
announced an OEM deal with Corel, which was a big hit at Comdex
with its new Linux distribution and application suite. One could
almost see the stock rise as the implications (in particular,
Windows-to-Linux migration) became apparent.</p><p>While at Comdex, I spoke with Robin Ford and Walt Keller, the
couple who founded GraphOn. Robin is Executive Vice President,
Sales and Marketing, and Walt is CEO and President. The talk was
recorded, and this is the edited transcript.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What's going on between
you guys and Corel?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: Years ago, Corel
started developing a technology called J-Bridge, which allows you
to access a Windows application from any desktop over any kind of
connection. They were doing it because they needed to web-enable
their existing applications. GraphOn has that technology for the
UNIX and Linux market. We allow people to access a UNIX or Linux
application from any desktop over any connection. This is great
because you can run an X application over a low-bandwidth line, and
it's like running an X server on your desktop. Corel ran into some
challenges in their technology about this time last year. They had
the core technology&mdash;the server part was coming along well&mdash;but
they needed to put together the protocols and the client. They were
already partners of ours for other reasons, and as they became more
familiar with our technology, they realized we do this sort of
thing for a living. It made more sense for us to carry this
forward, as we had the low-bandwidth protocol. Thus, we acquired
Corel's technology, which was unfinished at the time, and
integrated it with our software.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: And where are you with
it now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: We call it Win
Bridge, and we launched it here at the show. We've also &ldquo;OEMed&rdquo;
our technology to Corel. Thus, any Windows-based application can be
served to any desktop, and any Linux-based application can be
served to any desktop&mdash;over any connection.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: The exciting news for
Corel is they can now insert very strong support into the Linux
desktop. They can take any of their Windows applications and run
them on those Linux desktops. By that, I mean the application is
still running in an NT environment, but you can view and manipulate
it from your Linux desktop as if it were running locally. That's
the beauty of this bridging technology. Complete cross-platform
capabilities.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So this has all kinds
of implications for support, migration...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: Yes. It lets people
easily migrate into the Linux world. It's a difficult thing for
most enterprises. They can't say, &ldquo;Hey, we're going to switch to
Linux&rdquo;, and it's done. You need a migration path, and this
technology provides that path.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How is this playing out
in enterprises you know?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: Well, the most
interesting stuff at the moment&mdash;to us, at least&mdash;is in China. They
don't want to deal with sole-source suppliers. They truly like the
idea of Linux, and are very committed to it. Yet when you visit the
schools, they're training on Microsoft. But the bridge between one
and the other is a migration path that we pave. They're figured out
ways to do that with server-based technology.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So you've got three
bridges here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: Linux Bridge, Win
Bridge and UNIX Bridge, each a component of a product called
Bridges.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How do you see it
playing out in the Linux movement in general?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: Everybody agrees the
next step for Linux is the desktop. To be successful, Linux has to
be able to run Windows applications. Corel knows this, and they've
been very smart about their strategy. That's why they've OEMed the
Linux Bridge technology, and why it's very hot already, even though
we aren't shipping until the end of December. When we were on
ZD-TV, it was the most outrageous thing. Here was ZD-TV talking
about server-based computing&mdash;serving up Linux applications. They
invited people to come to the playpen part of our site and download
a Java applet that allows them to run WordPerfect running on Red
Hat on our server. It was amazing. We had thousands of people
registering to download the Linux server portion of our
product.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: What knocked people
out was they could sit there on their PCs and run Linux without
ever loading it. An interesting concept, and a great way to start
down the road to Linux or teach it over the Internet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I want to ask you guys
about this patent that seems to be a source of some
controversy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: We discovered the
controversy entirely by surprise. Obviously, it is not our
intention to be out there stifling innovation, especially in the
Linux community. We became aware of the patent because some of the
people we have in Seattle were developing this technology a long
time ago. We thought it was in the best interest of our
shareholders and customers that we acquire this patent. It covered
taking a Windows technology to a UNIX desktop using the X
server&mdash;in other words, right in the path of our own product
development. So our goal was just to acquire it and remove it as a
potential problem, for the good of everybody.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: That's interesting. I
wonder sometimes if the reason to get a patent like this is as
prophylaxis against the Jay Walkers of the world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: It is. These things
are like baseball cards. You've got to trade them. If you don't
have any, you don't get to trade.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You give yourself the
right to be the alpha developer in this space.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: It's a very strong
form of protection. The truth is, you can't work in this industry
without tripping over patents, and a patent of this type is a very
strong one. We had to have it&mdash;better us than someone else.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So you want the Linux
community to trust you to use it well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: That's right.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Let's go back to
origins here. For years, you guys were known as a hardware company.
What happened?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: About three years ago,
we saw the light. Before that, we were in the terminal business,
selling to the X community. We did quite well, but the PC won the
desktop. What we actually discovered was thin-client computing. We
developed this technology for UNIX in the late '80s; the desktop,
the client side, was very thin and all the heavy lifting happened
on the server. But we were swimming against the tide in those days,
very much against the flow of what people thought client-server
should be.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>:
Desktop-centric.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: And we were going the
opposite way. So finally, we decided to get out of the hardware
business, take this technology, and make it work on the desktop. We
found we were right in the middle of this new Internet conversation
which is much more server-centric. Sun snapped it up, then IBM, and
we were off and running. We funded ourselves last year, then went
public last July, and it's been a real ride ever since.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I've always been
interested in the soul of a company&mdash;where it comes from.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: We're a
family-oriented company. In case you didn't</p><p>notice, Walt and I are married, and the place is very much a
family operation.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Are your kids
involved?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: Yes, our daughter
works at the company. We welcome people bringing their kids in
during the day. It's not unusual to hear little ones in the
background. Our people work very hard, often for long hours, so we
try our best to integrate having a life with being a Silicon Valley
company. Although we've been around for a long time, we behave very
much like a start-up. That's our energy&mdash;very entrepreneurial&mdash;very
open-door&mdash;not very hierarchical. Walt is involved in almost
everything that's going on at the company. It's not a strict
reporting structure&mdash;just very entrepreneurial and very
productive.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You know each other.
That must count for something.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: Everybody here knows
each other. This value system we have applies to acquisitions too.
We picked up this group in Seattle. The people there had been
together for years and wanted to be in on what we have going here.
The fit has been excellent.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You've been around
since what, 1982?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Walt</b></span>: 1982, yeah&mdash;a long
time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Were you married when
you started the business?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: No. We got married in
1985. But we were together for a long time before we started out.
We just finally admitted to ourselves that it would work out.
(laughter)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: That's a great
story.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin</b></span>: It is a great story.
We've had fun, and we're having more fun than ever now.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254c580.0x2bcfa90"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>GraphOn site:

five? I confess I am guilty of this sort of thing, feeling
nostalgic for computer games that were state-of-the-art just a few
years back. Old is not necessarily bad. Modern software is
technically impressive, but how useful is it? Still, I have yet to
find a computer game that rivals chess in excitement, or Go in
elegance and subtlety, while both games are at least 1,500 years
older than computers. You'd think 3-D shooters would bore people to
death, or maybe we could do something more creative with the
amazing virtual-reality techniques we've got. Anyway, Linux remakes
of classic games are cultural oddities; I hope some anthropologist
catalogs them. In keeping with the theme of &ldquo;Linux on the
Desktop&rdquo;, here are some games you can play on your desktop!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254c580.0x2bcffb8"></a>Defendguin</h2></div></div><p>Linux gamers tend to have a soft spot in their hearts for the
disturbingly popular blast-Bill-Gates-to-pieces games, the family
of games in which Bill Kendrick's Defendguin is the newest member.
Yes, it's the classic Defender game, only the graphics aren't
hollow line drawings. The trick is to save the Penguinoids from
being mutated by little flying Gates saucers. In honor of the new
journalistic tradition of pulling random quotes and holding them up
as though they represent the entire community, here's a stellar

Q*Bert addicts. Black Penguin (&ldquo;rotund&rdquo; would be more accurate,
and anyway, it's a blue penguin) is a fellow who hops around
collecting happy things while avoiding his opponent, the Evil
Window. It uses Qt, the sources are well-commented, and it's a good
game for Linux newbies to get used to compiling software from the
source as well as learn from the source. I should warn you that Qt
is not LGPL, but I imagine you've already heard. The home page

looked pretty cool. Pair it with some Beethoven and an artsy,
scribbled logo, and you've got a happening intro for your next act
of brilliance. Ah, but how <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> we get the music
playing? Well, assuming Beethoven is what you want and not some
frantic dance pop, we've got to figure out a way to get music into
the program.</p><p>Years ago, this was tricky. We had to program in assembly
code and call a play routine every vertical blank. Before that,
pitched beeps had to be carefully inserted into the program, and
any deviance from the loop would cause the whole program and/or the
music to change speed. Fortunately, today we have multi-tasking
machines, so we don't have to bother with anything difficult; we
just fork a process or call a library routine. Now the question is,
what do we want to do? How to do it is easy.</p><p>For music in a Linux program, there are several options. One
is to use the sound card's built-in midi synthesizer, which is
extremely resource minimal. Xavier XOSXE uses this approach in his
excellent, high-resolution escapade SpaceBoom, reserving digital
audio exclusively for sound effects. This way, the CPU's resources
are left over for the horizontal scrolling landscape and
trigger-happy space aliens. Playing midi music is very simple; all
you have to do is <span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> to the
program <span   class="bold"><b>playmidi</b></span>. And no, it's not
cheating&mdash;fork is an integral part of the UNIX model. Consider that
by using it, you pay homage to the same function that got us past
the first <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> routine. Listing 1
is simple code for starting up your tune.</p><p>Just keep tabs on the process ID (PID) so you can kill the
playmidi program when you want to change tunes, or when the game is
finished. (The SpaceBoom source code, albeit C++, has a more
elegant example of how to do this.) With on-board synthesizers
improving dramatically, midi files are really a viable option for
music. They're easy to create, resource-minimal to play, have small
footprints, and are fun.</p><p>Another option is to use the time-tested, scene-approved,
MODs! From their birth on the Amiga, these things just won't die.
MODs are digital audio music files, which basically include audio
samples of the instruments, loop points and note data (newer
formats include more instrument parameters).</p><p>The advantage of MODs is they are digital audio, so you get
sample playback, as opposed to midi files which use preset
instruments on the sound card; MODs give you more flexibility. The
downside is that your CPU needs to dump a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span>
of data to /dev/dsp, so MODs are resource intensive. For example,
at 44,100Hz of 16-bit stereo (CD quality), you'll be writing 16
bits of data to each channel 44,100 times every second&mdash;that's
176,400 bytes of writing to /dev/dsp every second, not to mention
the calculations that go on within the mod-playing routine (volume,
mixing, effects, pitch slides, etc.).</p><p>These days, processors are incredibly fast, so MODs are more
practical than they used to be, but sound cards have better synths
than ever before. Wouldn't you like extra CPU for more intensive
graphics? While I definitely opt for midi, most people prefer MODs.
If you're making a game on CD-ROM, just record a whole album. Maybe
when we all have supercomputers, we can use mpegs in real time. You
can choose between MikMod and Midas for MOD playing; MikMod is GPL
while Midas is not quite, so in the spirit of GNU, let's try out
MikMod. Listing 2 is code for starting and stopping a MOD with
mikmod.h.</p><p>Next month, we'll finish up on sound for now and take a look
at how to use generic digital audio for sound effects.</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p><p>Listings are available by anonymous download in the file

SOURCE</h2></div></div><p>During the past two years many companies have come to support
the Linux operating system, but most do not come to open
source&mdash;their software products remain proprietary. Even those who
do open source their software usually do it only for Linux, keeping
Windows and UNIX versions closed. On December 7, this trend was
reversed in a big way.</p><p>Matra DataVision, a French company, announced it would be
making its product open source, not just for Linux, but for every
platform it supports. And this isn't some little do-nothing
product, either. It is an enterprise level product for geometric
modeling, ranging from CAD to 3-D geological mapping. Also, Matra
is not a small company looking for publicity for their product; its
CAS.CADE product accounts for 10% of the total market.</p><p>Matra has taken a good look at the Open Source movement and
seen the advantages that can be had with an open-source product.
The company believes this move will enable them to extend their
market outside its current limits with gains, not losses, in
profitability. They intend to concentrate their efforts in support
and development of technical applications for specific needs of
customers. These are exactly the areas most mentioned by advocates
of open-source business models. It is quite refreshing to see a
major company take the movement so seriously that they are willing
to base their whole business model on it.</p><p>Matra also intends to give its developments back to the
community. They have a team of 50 people dedicated to furthering
open-source development in this area and a web site at
<a href="http://www.opencascade.org" target="_self">http://www.opencascade.org/</a>
that is dedicated to open source. I talked to Sana Abou-Haidar,
Matra Marketing Manager, on December 10 and she told me, &ldquo;We have
decided to base the business model on the service part, so the
development part can be true open source. The license is completely
LGPL-compliant.&rdquo; Our conversation can be found on the
<i  >LJ</i> web site at
<a href="../000/5024.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/conversations/009.html</a>.</p><p>Linux has needed an enterprise-level CAD application, and now
it has one&mdash;one that not only supports Linux, but is also open
source. I wish Matra success and hope more companies will follow
their example in the coming months.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Potential</b></span>: Red Hat went from
