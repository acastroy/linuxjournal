book. After reading it, I can say that the writing is concise and
in places even terser than an uninformed reader might desire.
Overall, I think it succeeded.</p><p>The book contains 15 chapters and some useful appendices.
Chapter 1, &ldquo;Installing LINUX on your PC&rdquo;, starts off by assuming
the user has a Microsoft OS on his computer, has a net connection
and web browser, and wants to run more than one OS on the computer.
The instructions are fine if one does not run into any problems,
but if one does, the recommendation is to go to a web site or
Usenet newsgroup to read and ask questions. How many MS users have
the patience to do that? Other chapters are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;GNOME, the Linux GUI&rdquo; describes the GNU Network
Object Model Environment and Enlightenment.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Connecting to the Internet&rdquo; via a serial port
and modem.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Living in a Shell&rdquo; is an overview of bash,
piping and redirection.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The Linux File System&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Important Linux Commands&rdquo; contains brief
descriptions of commands and configuring a printer with X.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Text Editors&rdquo; covers vi, Emacs, pico, gnotepad+
and gEdit.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Slicing and Dicing&rdquo; describes filter commands
such as sort, uniq, grep and find with examples of using them with
pipes.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Rolling Your Own: Linux Programming&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Managing your E-mail&rdquo; is mostly about
Pine.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Compression, Encoding and Encryption&rdquo; introduces
tar, gzip, compress, shar, et al.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Linux does DOS and Windows&rdquo; discusses mtools,
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span>, DOSEMU, WINE, VMware and
Macintosh tools.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Tweaking Linux&rdquo; describes using the setup
utility for configuration, X, rc.d directory, linuxconf and
more.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Updating your Linux System&rdquo; explains RPM in
great detail.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Learning More About Linux&rdquo; covers web sites to
visit for more information.</p></li></ul></div><p>Appendix A lists all software packages on the Red Hat 6.0
CD-ROM included with the book. One particularly good feature is an
indication of how much disk space each will take. This could be
quite useful for someone trying to put together a fun setup on a
small hard drive. Appendix B contains &ldquo;The GNU General Public
License&rdquo;. Appendix C, &ldquo;DOS and UNIX Equivalencies&rdquo;, lists a
couple of dozen parallel commands with examples of usage.</p><p>I do have a few criticisms of this book. In Chapter 1,
several examples of hard drive partitions and/or CD-ROM drives
referred to by their /dev file names are given, but I don't believe
the average Microsoft software user could configure a system with
just the /dev information in this book. It was a serious omission
not to list the conventions for IDE, SCSI, etc. Luckily, the CD-ROM
installation procedure may help the uninitiated. Another problem
was the statement &ldquo;...but you can't really hurt anything if the
installation isn't successful....&rdquo; Without qualifying that your
original system absolutely must be backed up for this to be true so
that one can restore if necessary, I don't understand how using
DOS' <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> can't help hurting
something. It would have been nice for the author to guide the user
through <span   class="bold"><b>fips</b></span> and not just
fdisk.</p><p>I also had a problem with the facetious sentence in Chapter
13:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you think you did everything right and the
mouse still doesn't work, sometimes whacking it on a hard surface
while shouting, &ldquo;You stupid mouse!&rdquo;, works wonders.</p></blockquote></div><p>In my experience, the &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; is the mouse ball mashes a
sensor and one must then obtain a new mouse.
</p><p>Although Rankin emphasizes using GNOME and describes how
quite well in several chapters, he does not neglect the
command-line interface. Particularly good were chapters 2, 4, 7, 8,
10 (the description of Pine), 11 and 14 (the detailed explanation
of RPM).</p><p>For those whom I think of as typical Microsoft users, I
recommend they follow the step-by-step installation procedures in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux for Dummies, 2nd Edition</em></span>, then move on
to this book after they have a working Linux system. The
installation process described there will work with the CD-ROM that
comes with this book as well. For the Microsoft user who is willing
to read first and needs little guidance to solve problems easily, I
also recommend it. For someone who has already installed Red Hat
6.0 Linux and wants to learn more about its new capabilities, I
wholeheartedly recommend this book.</p></div></div>
