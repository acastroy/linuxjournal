    An introduction to a command-line program for matrix
    manipulation.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x13213a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The first time I heard about Matlab was
when DOS 3.3 was popular and my dad received a demo version on his
PC. I played around with it a bit, but soon lost interest because
there was no manual and I did not have any real use for it.
</p><p>The second encounter was about three years ago when I
attended a lecture on numerical mathematics. Some of the exercises
the students had to hand in were intended to be solved with Matlab.
There was even a handout describing the basic functions of the
program. As is usually the case with exercises, numerical homework
tends to be very time-consuming, so again I did not spend much time
on it. Soon thereafter, I installed Linux on my then new PC.</p><p>The third time I came into contact with Matlab was during my
diploma thesis. All serious data evaluation in the group where I
worked was done using Matlab&mdash;not on UNIX, but on a
Macintosh.</p><p>I asked whether I could bring my until-then &ldquo;unplugged&rdquo;
Linux box to the lab and network it. I got an IP number and a
weekend later the first Linux computer of our group was up and
running.</p><p>Campus licenses are available for various software and I was
quite happy to find Mathematica, Maple and Matlab for Linux.
Shortly afterwards, I was running the already-existing Mac-Matlab
scripts on my computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x1321608"></a>Introduction to Matlab</h2></div></div><p>Matlab is a command-line-driven program specializing in all
types of matrix manipulation. Everything in Matlab is expressed
using matrices; even a scalar can be thought of as a 1x1
matrix.</p><p>The first noncommercial version of Matlab was based on
LINPACK and EISPACK routines. Since then, much has changed and
Matlab is now one of the fastest packages available for numerical
computation.</p><p>When Matlab is started in an xterm, a prompt appears after a
brief display of the logo in a separate window. Basic editing is
possible, though the spoiled Linux user might miss tab completion.
(A sophisticated tab-completion feature recognizing file names
would be great.)</p><p>A nice feature of Matlab is the ability to cluster data into
compounds similar to structs in C, but it is not necessary to
define them in advance. One simply adds fields to a variable, i.e.,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>data.Temp</em></span> might be the temperature at which a
measurement was taken, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>data.B</em></span> is a vector
containing the values of the magnetic field at which the Hall
resistivities <span   class="emphasis"><em>data.rxy</em></span> were measured. Adding a
string <b  >data.date='July-4th-1999'</b> is not a
problem, either. Going a step further, it is even possible to use
object-oriented features.</p><p>For complex tasks involving more than two or three commands,
one can write scripts or functions. The difference between them is
that scripts are executed as if they were typed at the command
prompt, whereas functions use private memory with local and global
variables, and of course, can have multiple return values. The
syntax loosely follows C and makes scripting relatively
straightforward.</p><p>It is even possible to implement graphical front ends for
your Matlab application with all different kinds of buttons,
sliders and levers, as shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3502f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

dialogs are possible by combining buttons, sliders and graphs.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x1321be0"></a>User Interface</h2></div></div><p>The interface used in the Linux version is extremely simple
compared to the Windows or Macintosh version. No editor is provided
for scripting, so the user has to stick to Emacs or some other
editor. I personally use XEmacs in Matlab mode with syntax
highlighting. The mode was written by Matt Wette and can be found
at
<a href="ftp://ftp.alumni.caltech.edu/pub/mwette/matlab.el" target="_self">ftp.alumni.caltech.edu/pub/mwette/matlab.el</a>.
As far as I know, there is even a mode for GNU Emacs which makes it
possible to run a Matlab session within the Emacs window.</p><p>Debugging scripts is not nearly as comfortable as in the
Windows or Macintosh environment, where the editor windows have
buttons for running the script stepwise. Instead, debugging has to
be done by issuing commands for setting breakpoints, etc., on the
command line. Mathworks could make big improvements by adding, for
example, a window with Step In/Over/Out buttons with a display
showing the next command and offering the option of adding
breakpoints.</p><p>In my opinion, it should be rather straightforward to
implement this in Tcl/Tk with the script sending the specific
command to the command line. An inspection window for variables
would also be a neat feature, one that, to my knowledge, does not
even exist on other platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x1321df0"></a>Graphics</h2></div></div><p>Separate windows are used to display graphics. There is a
vast variety of different kinds of plots ranging from simple bar
charts to color-shaded 3-D plots with different light sources.
Every aspect of a plot can be controlled by setting the appropriate
variables. Since 5.3, it is possible to edit a graph directly with
a simple point-and-click interface.</p><p>A very handy feature is the support of LaTeX-like syntax for
text-in-graphics windows.</p><p>Exporting images to encapsulated PostScript is possible,
although importing the file into, e.g., a (La)TeX document might
not lead to the desired result, especially if there is extra text
in the figure. Matlab uses fixed-size fonts, so scaling the picture
can result in odd-looking tick labels. Therefore, an export mode
where text and graphics are written into separate files as in XFig
and Xmgr would definitely find friends in the (La)TeX community.
For publications, I still export the processed data and import it
into Xmgr.</p><p><a href="3502f2.jpg" target="_self">3502f2.gif</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x1322058"></a>Figure 2. Nice measurement of the Quantum Hall
Effect and the longitudinal resistance in a two-dimensional

commands similar to LaTeX.</h2></div></div><p>Figure 2 shows the trace of a hall measurement in the
two-dimensional electron gas of a GaAlAs heterostructure. The plot
was obtained from the commands issued as shown in Figure 3.</p><p><a href="3502f3.jpg" target="_self">3502f3.gif</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x1322210"></a>Figure 3. The startup screen of Matlab with some

might arise when copying scripts from one platform to the other is
CR/LF conversion.</p><p>A colleague of ours recently had a problem with a Macintosh
at work. It did not have enough memory to display a large matrix,
so she issued the command <span   class="bold"><b>save</b></span>
which stores the current state in the file matlab.mat, copied the
resulting file to our Linux server, loaded it under the Linux
version of Matlab, and continued her work on Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x13224d0"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>After the uproar in the Linux community concerning the
Mindcraft report, I could not resist running a benchmark with Linux
and MS Windows 98. The command
<span   class="bold"><b>bench(</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>) is a
Matlab script that times five different tasks from different fields
of numerical math and graphics. Data structures and general math
are tested by solving ordinary differential equations (ODE).
Floating-point values are the main issue of the Linpack part (LU),
sparse matrices mix both integer and floating-point calculation
(Sparse), 3-D graphs test z-buffering, and 2-D graphics test line
drawing. The parameter N gives the number of times a test is
performed. The higher the number, the more reliable the
test.</p><p><a href="3502t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a></p><p>The results of <span   class="bold"><b>bench(100)</b></span>
are shown in the first two lines of Table 1. The system the test
was run on is a 133MHz Pentium with 32MB of RAM. Linux is a bit
slower in all cases except when it comes to 2-D graphics, where it
is faster. The reason for this might be that the graphics driver
for Linux is better than the generic Windows driver. I did not
bother to install all possible drivers since VMWare (see &ldquo;VMWare
Virtual Platform&rdquo; by Brian Walters, July 1999) is now available,
and I won't need to reboot the machine any more in order to read an
Excel spreadsheet. I installed this PC emulator on our server which
has a 400MHz processor and 128MB of RAM. Just for fun, I ran the
same benchmark in the emulator and directly on Linux. The results
are listed in the remaining lines of the table.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1229580.0x13227e8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Features in the user interface could be drastically
improved&mdash;a user-friendly debugger would be great.</p><p>I was amazed by the quick response I got from the Matlab
newsgroup (comp.soft-sys.matlab). Matlab engineers seem to frequent
the forum quite often and provide immediate help and
support.</p><p>To put it all together, Matlab for Linux is a very useful
tool for doing numerical mathematics with a wealth of toolboxes,
including signal processing, symbolic computation, financial
mathematics and others.</p></div></div>
