    Over the years, we've seen
    many computer publications falter or fade as they sought faithful
    readers and fickle advertisers in the face of an ever-volatile
    industry.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc71580.0xd69450"></a></h2></div></div><p> It's a delight to debut column-wise in
one of my favorite magazines, a journal that has remained finely
focused since March 1994. Over the years, we've seen many computer
publications falter or fade as they sought faithful readers and
fickle advertisers in the face of an ever-volatile industry. There
has always been a broad spectrum of editorial targets with
&ldquo;content-addressed&rdquo; titles, ranging from the cosmic general
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span>) to the minutely specialized
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>printf() Daily</em></span>). By &ldquo;content-addressed&rdquo;, I
mean the magazine title aims both to capture (figuratively) the
themes to be addressed and to capture (factually) a viable market
segment. The old signifier-signified problem has oft raised its
intractable transient-fashion semantic head.
</p><p>Consider the demises of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Datamation</em></span> (why
does this sound archaic, in spite of recent data-centric
resurrections?) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>BYTE</em></span> (the once &ldquo;in&rdquo;
term, with a matching chain of Byte shops, encapsulating the 1980s
thrill of affordable, personal computing, but now worth a few
mundane bits). Some publications have survived with brash, broad
names such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Computer Weekly</em></span>, a title that
was quite content-specific in the 1960s but nowadays reveals only
its frequency. Others have gone for &ldquo;insider&rdquo; titles. Thus,
unless you already knew, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's</em></span> might at
first glance appear to be yet another paternal self-health
advisory. (Some Dobb's fans may say &ldquo;indeed&rdquo;.) Mostly, though,
it's an upfront WYSIWYG world (What You Subscribe to Is What You
Get). If you pay through the nose for <span   class="emphasis"><em>MSDN [Microsoft
Developer Network] News</em></span>, that's what you'll get: the
current designation, security vulnerabilities, APIs-du-jour, and
ETAs for NT 5.0. (To be fair, Dr GUI does offer &ldquo;work-arounds&rdquo; to
the baffled with non-corporate aplomb.)</p><p>There's no shortage of drop-dead titles that strutted bravely
but briefly and are heard no more. I wrote evangelically, no one
more, for <span   class="emphasis"><em>OS/2 Magazine</em></span> until it succumbed--
not for want of reader devotion (they screamed &ldquo;Stan, say it isn't
so...&rdquo;) but for IBM's own lack of commitment and the natural
ensuing reluctance of the advertisers.</p><p>Then we have the fascinating name-change phenomenon. Reacting
to those restless, highly paid &ldquo;demographers&rdquo; who filter your
blatant reader-response fibs through a statistically stunted
spreadsheet, the publisher-suits are often convinced that the
titular temperature needs a tweak. (Consultant Axiom #1: It's
difficult, alas, for the client to ignore expensive advice.)
Whether the content should change to reflect the &ldquo;hotter&rdquo; title
is a tricky problem. Too dramatic a shift in both is rather like a
new magazine launch and everything that entails. Instructive
exemplars abound: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Computer Language</em></span> moved
fairly gracefully to the less &ldquo;technical&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Software
Development</em></span> with an appropriate content-drift toward the
bland. (Its &ldquo;Peopleware&rdquo; articles are notorious for their vacuous
&ldquo;Cook Until Done&rdquo; recipes: &ldquo;Create a well-formed plan before you
start coding, and don't forget to select the best-possible team for
your project...&rdquo;) Similarly, following the trend set by Clemens
Szyperski's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Component Software&mdash;Beyond Object-Oriented
Programming</em></span> (Addison-Wesley/ACM Press, 1998) [Reference
1], SIGS's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Object Magazine</em></span> traveled &ldquo;beyond&rdquo;
to become <span   class="emphasis"><em>Component Strategies</em></span>. This advance
was cut short by another popular name-changing influence: the
publishing trade's agglutinative propensity. Following one of those
hard-to-keep-up-with takeovers (not to be confused with those
equally baffling &ldquo;strategic alliances&rdquo;), <span   class="emphasis"><em>Component
Strategies</em></span> has been newly &ldquo;folded&rdquo; into
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Application Development Trends</em></span>. Presumably,
this title allows the tracking of SE (Software Engineering)
fashions beyond mere components. An interesting counter-example,
where the content has been fashionably &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; without a title
change, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>C/C++ Users Journal</em></span> that now
carries a regular column and even detached supplements
on...shock-horror...drum-roll...Java! Recall that the earlier
post-incremental title update from <span   class="emphasis"><em>C Users
Journal</em></span> still triggers irate reader mail. Likewise, for
complex &ldquo;space-precludes&rdquo; reasons, we've seen the long-going
(1983) <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Review</em></span>, outliving all its UNIX
rivals [Reference 2], moved by market forces to (1998)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Review's Performance Computing</em></span> and now,
as I write, to simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>Performance
Computing</em></span>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Linux revives the old UNIX &ldquo;Live Free or Die&rdquo;
spirit of the 1970s. The only Open Road beckons. <i  >Linux Journal</i> leads the way. And lest we become too
