    &ldquo;In just a few more years, the current homogenized 'voice' of
    business-the sound of mission statements and brochures-will
    seem as contrived and artificial as the language of the
    18th-century French court.&rdquo; --The Cluetrain Manifesto
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdce580.0xec6558"></a></h2></div></div><p> Seven seconds is the life expectancy of
a detail. Phone numbers, names, street signs, the exact words in
the last sentence, all gone in seven seconds, give or take a few.
We can trick our minds into carrying more of the very recent past,
but only one fact remains: memory for detail is wickedly,
blessedly, short. Decay is the rule.
</p><p>Yet meaning persists, and if it has any value, it
grows.</p><p>Meaning is the valued cargo in our trains of thought. The
trains come and go, but their purpose is to leave goods on the
platform. That's what we <span   class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> from what the
other person says&mdash;or what they <span   class="emphasis"><em>deliver</em></span> when
their words <span   class="emphasis"><em>carry</em></span> meaning.</p><p>What do we mean when we talk about markets? Do we mean
populations of consumers we hope will buy our products? Do we mean
fields of battle where companies fight to grab or protect
territory? Do we mean invisible hands and other animal
forces&mdash;bulls and bears&mdash;that push stock prices up and down? Do we
mean a large drop zone at the end of the value chain?</p><p>How about when we use the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; as a verb? Do we
mean air support for sales troops on the ground? Do we mean selling
by another name? Do we mean &ldquo;serving the customer, no matter
what&rdquo;, as Theodore Levitt put it? Or do we mean nothing, as Tom
Hanks' character suggested in the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big</em></span>,
when he asked &ldquo;What's marketing?&rdquo; and his boss replied,
&ldquo;Exactly&rdquo;?</p><p>The truth is, we mean all those things&mdash;each one is a
metaphor. But here's what we forget: none of them were in use
before the Industrial Revolution. None of them have anything to do
with what markets were in the first place or how they really
work.</p><p>The first markets were places, not
<span   class="emphasis"><em>targets</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>demographics</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>seats</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>eyeballs</em></span> or other
abstractions. In the first markets, producers and consumers were a
handshake apart&mdash;and so were all the other reciprocal market nouns:
producer and consumer, vendor and customer, supply and demand. They
were all embodied in seller and buyer.</p><p>In the first markets, most sellers were also producers; most
buyers were also consumers. Our surnames still express the personal
roles our ancestors played in the markets they made: Weaver,
Potter, Hunter, Smith, Shoemaker, Baker, Fisher, Carpenter.</p><p>The first markets were central to culture itself. No setting
had a more civilizing effect on our species. The Greek word for
market, <span   class="emphasis"><em>agora</em></span>, means &ldquo;gathering place&rdquo;. The
Agora of classical Athens was where citizens gathered to make
civilization. Politics, philosophy and democracy&mdash;all Greek
words&mdash;were born in The Agora amidst the noise of commerce: vendors
and patrons arguing the merits and prices of good bread and bolts
of cloth.</p><p>For thousands of years, we knew exactly what markets were,
but when industry arrived, we began to forget. We made markets into
battlefields for competitors, populations of consumers, targets for
messages, collections of numbers, forces with animal natures,
economic demons and deities, and verbs for actions done to people
rather than with them. Why?</p><p>Industry pushed production and consumption far apart, then
reconceived business as an activity that begins with factories and
ends with consumers, interposing a vast distribution delta between
the two. As Alvin Toffler put it in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Third
Wave</em></span>, industry drove an &ldquo;invisible wedge&rdquo; between
production and consumption. By rending the two, this wedge &ldquo;ripped
apart the underlying unity of society, creating a way of life
filled with economic tension, social conflict and psychological
malaise.&rdquo;</p><p>The movement of materials from production to
consumption&mdash;from flax to linen and from ore to musket&mdash;was a long
one, but this distance made room for business at every stage along
the way. Thus the wedge Toffler talks about is the &ldquo;value chain&rdquo;
that runs like a conveyor belt from supply to demand, producer to
consumer. For two hundred years, we have been thinking in terms of
that chain and the metaphor it requires. In business, that metaphor
is shipping.</p><p>We literally conceive business in shipping terms. We make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span> that we <span   class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span>
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>delivery</em></span> through <span   class="emphasis"><em>distribution
channels</em></span>. What we now call <span   class="emphasis"><em>markets</em></span>
(populations of tastes, demographics or characterizations like
eyeballs) are so far removed from their suppliers that we need a
new professional concern, marketing, to understand and influence
them. To do its work, marketing uses military versions of business'
shipping metaphor. It <span   class="emphasis"><em>addresses</em></span> goods called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span>, but deploys them through
<span   class="emphasis"><em>campaigns</em></span> that are <span   class="emphasis"><em>aimed</em></span>
or <span   class="emphasis"><em>targetted</em></span> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>deliver
impact</em></span> or obtain
<span   class="emphasis"><em>penetration</em></span>.</p><p>In the Industrial Age, these metaphors made perfect sense,
but now that age is ending. It is customary to say we now live in
the Information Age, but we have also customarily conceived
information as an industrial good. In fact, we betray our
industrial thinking when we re-characterize information as content.
The popularity of the word &ldquo;content&rdquo; betrays a monstrous irony:
we live in an age of information, while continuing to think in
industrial terms.</p><p>For example, speaking to <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Week</em></span> last
year, Lycos CEO Bob Davis said, &ldquo;We're a media company. We make
our money by delivering an audience that people want to pay for.&rdquo;
Note the two different species: audience and people. And note the
roles: the audience is cargo; the people are customers. You can see
Toffler's wedge sticking out of Davis' head like an axe. Look in
the mirror of our own prose, and we see the same axe wedged in our
own heads.</p><p>With that axe still stuck in our heads, we misconceive what's
really going on in the marketplace. We don't see that the Third
Wave is not the next stage after the Second Wave, but a return to
the First.</p><p>The Internet is not just a way to ship content. It is the new
agora. It restores markets to what they were in the first place:
settings where people can meet, talk about &ldquo;Stuff that Matters&rdquo;
(thank you, Slashdot), and sell goods to each other. It allows us
to reconceive markets as conversations&mdash;just as they were before we
began to forget, before the long interruption we call the
Industrial Age.</p><p>What does all this have to do with Linux? It's us&mdash;the Linux
community&mdash;along with like-minded carpenters building the new agora
with materials and methods (especially open source) that we create
and share. We do it for the same reason our ancestors did it: it's
good for everybody's business.</p><p>More than any other professional category, open-source
developers are demonstrating the truly conversational nature of
markets. That means we are the ones in the best position to
remember and demonstrate what &ldquo;market&rdquo; actually means. It's our
job to start yanking those axes out of everybody's heads.</p></div></div>
