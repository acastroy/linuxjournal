Cutter, NCutter@ricegrowers.com.au
</p><p>Like most modern operating systems, Linux uses write caching.
Turning the computer off (it's hard to get it to crash without an
actual hardware problem) without properly shutting it down can
cause data errors on your hard drive. To solve this problem, you
should do exactly what it says: run
<span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> manually on your hard drive.
You should do this from a boot disk. The boot disks that you used
to install Linux are usually fine for this purpose. Simply run
<b  >fsck&nbsp;/dev/sda1</b> (the partition that is
showing the errors). The program will prompt you to fix each error
in exactly the same way that&mdash;Chad Robinson,
Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>No, it is not stalled, it just isn't yet booted. You must run
fsck by hand (<b  >e2fsck /dev/sda1</b>) and reply to
questions. Most likely, you'll just answer yes to any questions, so
you might even add the <b  >-y</b> switch to e2fsck,
although this is considered unsafe. When you are done, exit from
the shell (<b  >exit</b>) and the system will reboot.
Since not every file system repair can be performed automatically
in a fail-safe way, human intervention can be required when bad
errors are detected. I can't tell what caused the problem, but I
dare say the most likely reason is some hardware failure (the disk
itself or a RAM chip), as fsck found an all-one word (0xffffffff,
or 4294967295) where real data was expected.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,

have downloaded the kernel and it compiles fine. I installed the
zImage and System.map files where required. However, when I try to
boot up again, the kernel version is still 2.2.7. Subsequently, the
system tries to load the 2.2.7 modules and not the 2.2.12 modules I
require.  &mdash;Michael Hoegen, m_hoegen@yahoo.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Copying the image files to the correct disk
locations isn't enough. In fact, your system may</em></span> stop
booting shortly. You need to tell your boot loader that you've done
this. Linux isn't running yet when your system needs to find that
file, so to work around that problem, your boot loader records its
physical disk location, and copying one file over another always
changes this location. If you are using LILO as your boot loader,
you can simply type <b  >lilo</b> at your shell prompt
(as root) to force it to see this file. If you are using another
boot loader, consult that program's documentation.  &mdash;Chad Robinson,
Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>I don't think you reran /sbin/lilo after copying the kernel,
and most likely you didn't even copy the kernel to the right place.
If you truly overwrote the kernel and only forgot to run lilo, your
system will stop booting very soon (I won't dig into the technical
details here; please check LILO documentation and my article about
booting in the June 1997 <i  >LJ</i>). When upgrading the kernel on a
working box, you should always keep a copy of the previous
(working) kernel, to recover the computer in case the new kernel
image doesn't work for you. To do that, you should add another
&ldquo;image=&rdquo; stanza to /etc/lilo.conf and rerun lilo. If your
lilo.conf is not well-commented, you'll need to refer to proper
documentation (such as man lilo.conf).  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,
rubini@linux.it</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a6580.0x269ebe0"></a>Odd Booting Message</h2></div></div><p>When Linux boots, I receive the message &ldquo;LIL-&rdquo;.
Documentation said that it is a description table error. How can I
fix this problem?  &mdash;Adrian Lasso, alasso@baufest.com</p><p>LILO is looking for your kernel and can't find it. Usually
this happens in one of two cases. The first is when you install a
new kernel and forget to tell LILO it's there by running
<span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span> as root before rebooting. The
second is when LILO simply can't cope with your hard drive format.
You can solve it either way by booting from a set of boot disks and
rerunning LILO. If running it alone doesn't help, try running it as
<b  >lilo -l</b>. This often lets LILO work around
certain hard drive formats that it otherwise might not be able to
read.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>Recovering from such problems is not trivial, as you need an
alternate way to boot. I'd suggest you rerun /sbin/lilo after
entering your system on booting from CD or floppy. Also, adding a
&ldquo;linear&rdquo; keyword to the /etc/lilo.conf file is usually
beneficial. These problems, however, are usually very hard to track
down; you can find a lot of information on architectural problems
related to system boot in Andries Brouwer's pages, at
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb" target="_self">http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/</a>.  &mdash;Alessandro

able to issue LILO boot commands on the serial console. Eventually,
if all goes well, I'd like the machine to be totally headless. If
you could give me a hands-on &ldquo;how to do this&rdquo;, it would be great.
I have already read your &ldquo;Serial Terminal as Console&rdquo; (Issue #36,
April 1997) article, but I don't get the LILO prompt on my
terminal.  &mdash;Rick McFarland, mbsrick@ctel.net</p><p>This is not a problem at all. If you run kernel 2.2 or 2.3,
just configure serial console support and read
Documentation/serial-console.txt. If you run 2.0, you must apply
the serial-console patch
(<a href="ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/miquels/kernel" target="_self">ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/people/miquels/kernel/</a>)
and fall back to the previous case. To use LILO on the serial port,
just add <b  >serial=0,9600n8</b> or an equivalent line
to the /etc/lilo.conf file. In order to interact with LILO, you'll
need to send a &ldquo;break&rdquo; character.  &mdash;Alessandro Rubini,
rubini@linux.it</p><p>Here are the relevant two lines from my lilo.conf file for
serial port 1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

w1 off of the server. I'm wondering how I go about creating a
simple network between the two and the concepts involved.  &mdash;Nick
Anderson, neekolai1@hotmail.com</p><p>You are slightly confused when you use the DOMAIN term; what
you are giving are FQDNs (fully qualified domain names or host
names with the domain attached).</p><p>Being able to ping yourself doesn't mean much; it can work
even if your network is non-functional. You may have a bad cable or
some other link-layer problem. You should check the link light on
both of your Ethernet cards to make sure it's lit. Maybe you
connected the machines directly without using a crossover
cable.</p><p>To run an application on a remote display, you need to do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

allowing anyone on the server to take over your X display and snoop

2.x which isn't free), as SSH takes care of X security and the
