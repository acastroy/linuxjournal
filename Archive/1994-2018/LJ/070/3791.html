    Office suites are the mainstay application for any OS; Linux
    has two competing for your business.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15cf5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>We humans love glowing boxes. Monitors,
TV sets, suns, moons, lanterns, candles&mdash;it all goes back thousands
of years, when we sat around in tribes staring into the fire.
Computers? As long as we're comfortable while staring into the
glowing box, it matters little what exactly we're doing. The light
is comforting, hypnotizing. Still, some crazy person got this idea
that computers ought to have a use, nay, a killer app. Now we're
cursed with spreadsheets, word processors, databases, development
tools, office suites, mathematical packages... Well, Scott McNealy
doesn't want your money (at least not right away), so we might as
well make the best of it.
</p><p>I must admit, the &ldquo;warring office suites&rdquo; cover has an air
of commercialism to it, but it's not far from the truth. At the
same time, it doesn't tell the whole story&mdash;Sun and Applix have
their minds on bigger things. It is true that on one level, we have
a price war in a particular market (cross-platform office suites
for Linux/UNIX), but Sun's plans for StarOffice and Applix's ideas
for Applixware are fixed on a less immediate horizon. Before we
look at the offerings of these respective packages, it's worth the
effort to find out where these products are heading.</p><p>Sun acquired StarOffice last August and has been giving it
away free of charge. It's not open source, not guaranteed to always
be free, and it is proprietary software replete with generic
licensing nonsense&mdash;still, you can now download all 65MB of it
without paying a fee. You can also order it on CD for $10 or $40 if
you want documentation and support. The question is, where is Sun
going with this? A typical cynic might expect Sun to dump
StarOffice on the market, drive out the competition, and then start
charging for the updates&mdash;typical rent-seeking behavior. However,
Sun's plan is a bit more visionary. Remember web-based e-mail? Sun
wants a web-based office suite.</p><p>StarPortal will be the name of this &ldquo;portal computing&rdquo;
office suite, but since it's first-class vaporware, we don't know
how it will be implemented (well, Java). Still, everyone wants to
cash in on the falling cost of bandwidth. StarPortal will have many
obstacles to overcome (stability, security,
accessibility/availability, even the client/server implementation
itself), but at least Sun has the size and capital to pull off this
kind of project as far as it can go, and Sun owns Java.</p><p>Applix, not to be left behind, in fact to be in front with
software instead of vaporware, is also expanding into the
thin-client office suite market. Anyware Office, Applix's answer to
the portable office problem, is an 800K Java applet which allows a
user to have office suite access from within any Java environment
(Netscape, IE, JavaOS, etc.). You need to have Applixware on your
home machine, of course, but if you've got this much, you can set
up a home office and contact it from any terminal whenever
necessary. It's quite a clever model, one both Applix and Sun are
pursuing. One difference in strategy is that Sun hopes to have
StarOffice accessible even from PDAs (personal digital assistants
with their half-functional web browsers) while Applix, at least for
now, is staying solidly on the functional web-browser level.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3791f1.large.jpg"><img src="3791f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Applixware Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Another issue is the use of Java. Years ago, when asked for
my opinion of Java, I said it was not a serious language, but only
a distraction, trendy and not worth the effort. Nowadays, Java has
grown in popularity, not entirely on its own merits but because of
C's memory management issues and C++'s tendency to produce
memory-leaking monstrosities (well, low-level languages do expect
you to deal directly with memory). Java has been quite successful
on the Internet and intranets and is enthusiastically supported on
account of its attempt at platform independence. However,
developers must be aware that Java is a proprietary language. The
specification is open: anyone can write Java programs, compilers or
interpreters, but Sun owns the rights. It's probably not a good
idea to become dependent on proprietary languages, and much better
languages are available, but Java is nevertheless where our
Linux-based office suites are headed.</p><p>Now we know where these office suites are going, so how do we
choose between them? This assumes, of course, that we are willing
to rely on commercial software. It's mildly difficult to get by
without using commercial wares from time to time, so if you can,
maybe you <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> a saint, or at least truly
clever. Office suites are often the justification for getting a
computer, and if you've been in school recently, you know exactly
how much of your otherwise pleasant life is spent in front of a
word processor. Likewise, science types may often find themselves
chained to spreadsheets and need to have a fast, stable package
with all the formulas and graphing functions that might come up. In
any event, if you want to use a computer with only one OS on it and
expect to get something done other than hacking, a word processor
is a good idea.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15cfb30"></a>At a Glance</h2></div></div><p>Precisely what is included in an office suite varies from one
vendor to another. Applixware and StarOffice provide many of the
same applications, but each offers a couple of things the other
does not. StarOffice has quantitatively more offerings, although
one is well-advised to consider quality over quantity. And of
course, the real question isn't &ldquo;who's best?&rdquo;, but which one
makes you happiest. To complicate matters, StarOffice is free of
charge at the moment while Applixware costs $100, so there is
definitely a price incentive to go with StarOffice. At the same
time, office suites are like office chairs; you should be sure you
have the right one, because you're going to be spending a lot of
time with it. Also, there is something to be said for the danger of
letting larger businesses affect Microsoft-style price wars
(&lt;\#224&gt; la Internet Explorer), but one wants to go with the
best product either way, and Sun may adopt a semi-open-source
policy at some point. Regardless, Table 1 is a summary of the
similar offerings from Applixware and StarOffice.</p><p><a href="3791t1.html" target="_self">Application Summary</a></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3791f2.large.jpg"><img src="3791f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. StarOffice Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Superficially speaking, the look-and-feel difference between
StarOffice and Applixware is that StarOffice features itself as
having a self-contained, uniform office environment, all in one
window (see Figure 1), whereas Applixware's components are
integrated but have individual windows operating within the window
manager's environment (see Figure 2). The advantage of StarOffice's
approach is that users have a complete office environment they can
use on any platform with any window manager, without having to deal
with anything unfamiliar. Likewise, the advantage of Applixware's
approach is that it gives more flexibility to the user to
manipulate the windows in whatever ways happen to work best. Hence,
the disadvantage, if you call it that, is users will need the
brainpower to cope with a window manager. Still, it must be said
that window managers for Linux have become nothing short of
amazing, while StarOffice's environment does not look as nice or
work as well as any of our typical window managers or desktop
environments. In fact, StarOffice's habit of restricting everything
to one window loses the benefit of virtual desktops and can lead to
several layers of clutter. However this is entirely an issue of
personal taste, and while I prefer Applixware's flexibility of
windows, many people will prefer StarOffice's self-contained
environment, and none of this should really matter compared to the
capabilities of the suites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15cff50"></a>Word Processors&mdash;Applix Words and
StarWriter</h2></div></div><p>The word processor may be the most popular computer
application and consequently has become a flagship product in
office suites. Corel, for example, is planning to deliver an office
suite for Linux based around the strength of WordPerfect. Word
processors don't actually do anything phenomenal and they're very
similar these days, so as a result of an effort to improve word
processors that are already just fine, they have become overrun
with gratuitous functions, while it seems some basic areas are
given less attention than they might deserve.</p><p>An important consideration for Linux users who want to purge
MS Word from their life, but need to read and write .doc files, is
how well a Linux word processor can import and export different
file formats. StarOffice Writer and Applix Words both export and
import MS Word files and RTF (Rich Text Format), but Applixware
supports more import/export formats including WordPerfect, Frame
MIF and various ASCII formats, while StarOffice has very strong
support for export formats but less support for importing. &ldquo;It's
not us vs. them, it's us <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> them&rdquo; says
Applix's web site, and this consideration is taken more seriously
with Applixware. Sun probably doesn't see things this way and has
the capital to make this an &ldquo;us vs. them&rdquo; struggle. In fact, Sun
has developed a program to wean people from MS Office and get them
trained for StarOffice. Still, cooperation is nice, and these
processors would benefit from increased support of standards like
PostScript and PDF. The existing support for importing and
exporting document formats is not quite perfect in either, and
there seems to be some resentment on all fronts to keep up with
everyone's formats. However, documents are less complicated than
spreadsheets, so you can expect things to be all right here.</p><p>As for the gratuitous functions, both Applix Words and
StarOffice Writer are loaded. Obviously, these days you can easily
import whatever you want into your document, especially anything
created with any other component of the office suite. This is
exceedingly useful, but a host of other features go a bit over the
top. Both suites can make all sorts of formatting contortions,
format automatically, correct errors, offer thesaurus support,
insert all kinds of objects and fields, sort, merge and manipulate
whatever you like. And, of course, there's clip art&mdash;lots of it.
Word processing has become synonymous with desktop publishing, and
now it's moved into the new territory of the Web.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0160"></a>HTML&mdash;Applix HTML Author and StarWriter</h2></div></div><p>For your desktop web-publishing needs, Applix offers HTML
Author, a variation of Applix Words designed specifically to create
web pages. StarOffice Writer, the word processor, is likewise
equipped for producing web documents. Already you can include
hyperlinks in normal text files, but with these packages, you can
create and format documents for the Web. After all, it's the most
logical extension of desktop publishing, since web content can
reach an enormous audience while consuming practically no resources
(compared to the tree-slaughtering, postal-service-dependent
printing press). It seems a bit like cheating to use these visual
web programs instead of just writing the HTML yourself, but WYSIWYG
can be more appealing than the trial-and-error (type this and see
what happens) approach. The HTML capabilities are more of a
convenient extension of desktop publishing functionality than a
substitute for Netscape (or preferably just learning HTML),
although you can also browse the Web with them; StarOffice Writer
works much better for this. Also, there's no clever caching as in
Netscape, so you're best off with Netscape/Mozilla or KFM for web
browsing with graphics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0268"></a>Graphics&mdash;Applix Graphics and StarDraw</h2></div></div><p>If you want serious graphics, you need either the GIMP or to
wait for CorelDRAW. For any small or medium-size drawing projects
especially producing objects for your documents, spreadsheets or
presentations, the Applixware and StarOffice drawing applications
can do what you need quickly and easily. Applix Graphics looks
simple on the surface, like X Paint, but has much to offer
including support for many graphics formats. It is simple and easy
to use, but not exactly full-featured. In contrast, the StarOffice
Draw and Image programs are well-designed for graphics components
in an office suite (the phrase &ldquo;almost engineered&rdquo; comes to
mind). There is a good assortment of brushes, effects and
functions, all of which are quite flexible. The brush control is
particularly nice. It's a bit complicated to get around, but if you
can figure it out, you can produce usable graphics without much
effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0370"></a>Spreadsheet&mdash;Applix Spreadsheets and
StarCalc</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3791f3.large.jpg"><img src="3791f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. StarCalc Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>The spreadsheet was once the killer app of the computer
world, and maybe it still is. As useful as word processors are, it
is the spreadsheet that best exploits the computer's
number-crunching capabilities. From office workers to
statisticians, scientists and students, it seems we're all on
spreadsheets at one point or another. Spreadsheets can dig into
databases, crunch enormous amounts of information, spit out
colorful and elegant graphs, and provide answers for our
mathematical and statistical curiosity; hence they're quite
popular. However, spreadsheets are tricky. There are so many
different functions and syntaxes to support, it becomes very
difficult to give comprehensive support to numerous popular
spreadsheet file formats. The Applixware and StarOffice spreadsheet
programs are quite good in their own right, but still have
compatibility issues. Of course, Excel doesn't exactly support
Applixware and StarOffice formats, either.</p><p>Cross-platform support is a big problem with Applixware
Spreadsheets and StarCalc. While supporting word processor formats
is not so difficult, the complexity involved in formulas, arrays,
titles, graphics, tables, relationships, etc. makes it excruciating
to program a spreadsheet that can deal with so many formats. If you
import complicated spreadsheets, expect to find some titles missing
and some functions listed as unimportable.</p><p>Ideally, you will be running your business on Linux/UNIX
machines, so you shouldn't have to put up with Windows formats on a
regular basis. There is a growing awareness of Linux as a business
platform, and we can all help this along by taking the leap to
break away from our dependency on non-native spreadsheet
formats.</p><p>As for the spreadsheets themselves, they're fast and high
quality, the difference being that StarCalc (see Figure 3) has far
more to offer in terms of functions while Applixware Spreadsheets
is fast and easier to use. Applix says Wall Street brokers use
their software, and it's pretty good in the financial department.
However, Applixware is missing too many formulas for it to be
useful for serious statistical work (without having to program your
own formulas, which can be done), whereas StarCalc is well-endowed,
which can also mean a higher success rate in importing formats.
Applixware is also quite inaccurate in its current incarnation in
dealing with discrete floating-point operations. Worth considering
is the excellent Xess spreadsheet from Business Logic, very fast
and full of formulas, which I will review next month. If
spreadsheets are crucial to you, check this one out before
deciding.</p><p>The graphics on both spreadsheet packages are fine. The
computer will generate color graphs of your data, rotate it, label
it, and let you decide all the details of how it will look. This is
typical of spreadsheets, but these actually do a good job of it.
StarCalc is more thorough and offers some nice 3-D functions.
Applixware is a bit funny; it uses chi as the formula icon, but
then doesn't have chi stat formulas.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0840"></a>E-mail&mdash;Applix Mail and StarMail</h2></div></div><p>There is little to be said about e-mail. It's not hard to
implement, so it works. Both Applix Mail and StarMail are fine for
sending and receiving e-mail, supporting MIME, Sendmail, POP3,
folders, etc. These actually seem a bit dull, and I'd prefer to use
mutt with all its colors, but they're integrated components and
that's what' important. StarOffice even has its own threaded
newsreader called Discussion.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0948"></a>Presentation&mdash;Applix Presents and
StarImpress</h2></div></div><p>Presentation software is important for people who make
presentations. If you are one of these people, you can use one of
these packages. As is typical in the Applixware/StarOffice
comparison, Applixware is simpler while StarOffice is more
thorough. I found Applix Presents to do well for informal affairs
(probably just on account of the nature of its templates), while
StarImpress would be better suited for formal presentations,
although this is a bit categorical. StarImpress has a nice
collection of templates and a well-designed drawing program, so
with some resourcefulness, you can put together quite a decent
presentation. Applix Presents will also do for most circumstances
and it's quite easy to use, but seems a bit less flexible and the
included templates are not as beautiful. Since presentation
software is so bureaucratic and businesslike, it fits in with the
office-culture scene, but I have my doubts as to its value. Still,
it's fun to play around with.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0a50"></a>Database&mdash;Applix Data and StarBase</h2></div></div><p>In the <i  >LJ</i> Readers' Choice poll, many
people asked, &ldquo;Who needs databases?&rdquo;, and honestly, they can be a
bit dull. In any case, StarOffice has a database with drag-and-drop
and relational-link capabilities between several tables. Applixware
in turn has more or less the same thing, to spare you the effort of
learning SQL. ODBC (for example, MySQL and ADABAS) should work
fine, so if you feel the need to bother with databases, you can
choose either of these tools. Not being a database connoisseur, I
don't have a preference.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15d0bb0"></a>Development&mdash;Applix ELF</h2></div></div><p>A key element of Applixware Office is ELF, the Extension
Language Facility, a scripting language with interactive
interpreter, compiler and debugger. The idea is to allow rapid
prototyping, so there are over 3,300 macros included, as well as
typical user-interface design tools such as a menu editor, bitmap
editor, drag-and-drop/dialog editor, a TCP/IP socket interface and
an SQL database interface. Applix says the Applixware Office suite
is written largely in ELF, so clearly it's capable of something.
Although it was once proprietary, ELF has been detached from
Applixware and is available under LGPL as SHELF. Inside of
Applixware, the giant advantage of ELF is that it rapidly allows
users to extend the functionality of the suite. Businesses each
have their own peculiar demands, and this kind of flexibility and
extensibility is said to have popularized Applixware. ELF is a
composite of Elisp and BASIC (sounds promising, eh?), but
apparently ELF is more like an evolved awk or sed.</p><p>Applix Builder is the integrated development environment for
designing and debugging ELF programs. The ELF library is LGPL and
can be dynamically linked. The applixware.org web site is devoted
to the open-source exchange of ELF software. It's an interesting
attempt at utilizing the open-source phenomenon to increase the
value of a product, and it may actually be working. In any event,
you can incorporate C, C++ and CORBA into your ELF code, so it's
fairly powerful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15c75a0"></a>Office Planning&mdash;StarSchedule</h2></div></div><p>StarOffice has a unique offering, an office-scheduling
program which is a lot like those big white calendar sheets people
put on their desks&mdash;only digital and a bit more organized. Control
freaks can chart out their days, weeks and months and keep track of
projects, meetings and the usual business events. PDA enthusiasts
may find this quite useful, as StarOffice Schedule will synchronize
data with PDAs such as the PalmPilot. I think
<span   class="bold"><b>plan</b></span> is good enough, but at least
you've got this scheduler around if you feel inclined to use
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15c7700"></a>Applix Filters and StarTools</h2></div></div><p>By including so many components, Applixware and Sun haven't
made it easy to quantify their office suites. First, the filters.
There are a ton of them, and they work well enough to get a file
loaded into your office suite. However, there are far more filters
than importers, and filters take things away. That means you can
bring a document, spreadsheet or presentation across, but
umprocessable data will be removed and you'll have to fill it in by
hand. Exporting is a bit easier to implement, especially for simple
files. In general, the less fancy the file, the easier it is to
move. The more advanced the formatting, the more likely it will be
mangled, er, filtered.</p><p>StarTools are components of the individual programs in the
office suite. StarOffice Image, for example, is part of StarDraw;
Chart is part of the spreadsheet; Math is a formula editor; Gallery
is for navigating clip art and other multimedia bits; HelpAgent is
the on-line help; Navigator is your typical GUI; Stylist manages
the templates. Ultimately, they're just necessary components. For
advertising purposes, Sun catalogs its accessories while Applix
catalogs its filters, although both packages have components. It's
generally true that StarOffice is better on accessories and
Applixware is better on filters, but both are fairly
well-balanced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15c7860"></a>Which One to Choose?</h2></div></div><p>The question on so many minds is how to set up a productive
Linux desktop, and preferably, how to do it inexpensively.
StarOffice is free of charge right now, so if you have the
bandwidth, you might as well download it. It has a slightly steeper
learning curve than Applixware, but once you have it down, you
should be able to do anything. The point is, it's free, so if it's
good enough for you, there's little sense in spending money unless
you are worried about Sun gaining market dominance and not trusting
what will happen afterwards. If you plan to spend most of your time
writing, I'd opt for WordPerfect. Likewise, if you are going to be
dependent on a spreadsheet, at least consider Xess before making a
decision.</p><p>Applixware has its advantages. It's much faster than
StarOffice (which has a habit of crashing and leaving tracers), and
the interface is easier to negotiate. The feel is quite UNIX, and
it's been a standard for a long time. Probably most, if not all,
programs in Applixware are easier to use for anything basic, but
when you find yourself wanting those weird, hard-to-do things,
you'll probably have a higher success rate with StarOffice.
Businesses could definitely take advantage of ELF, so I would
recommend they consider Applixware Office, while I would suggest a
download of StarOffice for individuals who just want to save
money.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d7580.0x15c79c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Linux office suites are not quite as easy as on other
platforms. The features aren't all there, but if you're the
slightest bit clever, you can do anything. A large part of the fun
of using Linux is roughing it. &ldquo;I'm not supposed to be able to do
this, but look&mdash;I did it anyway!&rdquo; is a defiant thrill, a key part
of the Linux experience. The time when everything will work
perfectly and there won't be any obstacles to office work is not
far off. In the meantime, enjoy the mild challenges that come up
when you have to do something weird that isn't quite supported; in
the future, it's a recreational activity we might not have.</p><p>The market itself is a curious issue. Software's free nature
has enabled the Open Source movement, but has also delivered to the
commercial software industry the incantation for Armageddon, the
ultimate price war. Applix is a strong competitor with unique
offerings and intelligent strategies and should survive this full
scale assault. Applix launched smartbeak.com, a web site devoted to
the open-source exchange of ELF programs, and more recently
acquired CoSource.com, a web site that matches free source
developers with funding (truly a more modern development model).
Nevertheless, the free-of-charge tactic exposes another fundamental
defect in the already failing Cathedral-style, proprietary model.
Without intervention, the commercial software industry might burn
itself up, but with intervention it could strangle itself with more
and more regulations imposed to support an arbitrary and
inefficient development model, especially considering the
impracticality of enforcing arbitrary &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;
laws which are already considered illegitimate by many. With the
new weapons of free-of-charge price wars, look-and-feel patents and
reinforced hard-core digital copyright laws, this is a trip-wire
and land-mine industry.</p><p>One thing we do know is this: Linux is completely ready to be
your one and only desktop OS. We've got two excellent office
suites, with more on the way, as well as individual components such
as Corel WordPerfect and the Xess spreadsheet. Abolish your DOS
partition, and put Linux on your secret Macintosh. What was once a
hacker's project is now a completely viable system for home users,
corporate users, government and public institutions, scientists,
researchers, high school and college students; and yes, it's still
the strongest magnet of brainpower in the computer world.</p></div></div>
