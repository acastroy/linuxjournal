    The authors have studied five libraries that can be used
    for multi-thread applications and herein present the
    results.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110c580.0x12047c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recent years have seen an increase in the
popularity of threads, because there are many applications in which
threads are useful. In many aspects, threads operate in the same
manner as processes, but can execute more efficiently. All modern
operating systems today include some kind of support for thread
management. Moreover, threads have been standardized by the IEEE
Technical Committee on Operating Systems. This standard allows
users to write portable multi-thread programs.
</p><p>As with other operating systems, Linux includes
multi-threading capability, and some multi-threading libraries are
available for Linux. We will describe a comparative study of five
threads packages for Linux: CLthreads, LinuxThreads, FSU Pthreads,
PC threads and Provenzano Pthreads. All libraries evaluated make
use of POSIX-compliant functionality. The main objective of this
study is to evaluate and compare the performance of some
multi-thread features to analyze the suitability of these libraries
for use in multi-thread applications. Also, we make a comparison
with Solaris threads.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110c580.0x1204920"></a>The Notion of Threads</h2></div></div><p>A thread is an independent flow of control within a process.
A traditional UNIX process has a single thread that has sole
possession of the process' memory and other resources. Threads
within the same process share global data (global variables, files,
etc.), but each thread has its own stack, local variables and
program counter. Threads are referred to as lightweight processes,
because their context is smaller than the context of a process.
This feature makes context switches between threads cheaper than
context switches between traditional processes.</p><p>Threads are useful for improving application performance. A
program with only one thread of control must wait each time it
requests a service from the operating system. Using more than one
thread lets a process overlap processing with one or more I/O
requests (see Figure 1). In multiprocessor machines, multiple
threads are an efficient way for application developers to utilize
the parallelism of the hardware.</p><p>This feature is especially important for client/server
applications. Server programs in client/server applications may get
multiple requests from independent clients simultaneously. If the
server has only one thread of control, client requests must be
served in a serial fashion. Using multi-thread servers, when a
client attempts to connect to the server, a new thread can be
created to manage the request.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3184f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Overlapping Processing and I/O Requests
</p></div></div><p>In general, multi-threading capabilities are of great benefit
to certain classes of applications, typically server or parallel
processing applications, allowing them to make significant
performance gains on multiprocessor hardware, increase application
throughput even on uniprocessor hardware, and make efficient use of
system resources. Threads, however, are not appropriate for all
programs. For example, an application that must accelerate a single
compute-bound algorithm will not benefit from multi-threading when
the program is executed on uniprocessor hardware.</p><p>There are two traditional models of thread control:
user-level threads and kernel-level threads.</p><p>User-level thread packages usually run on top of an existing
operating system. The threads within the process are invisible to
the kernel. Threads are scheduled by a runtime system which is part
of the process code. Switching between user-level threads can be
done independently of the operating system. User-level threads,
however, have a problem: when a thread becomes blocked while making
a system call, all other threads within the process must wait until
the system call returns. This restriction limits the ability to use
the parallelism provided by multiprocessor platforms.</p><p>Kernel-level threads are supported by the kernel. The kernel
is aware of each thread as a scheduled entity. In this case, a set
of system calls similar to those for processes is provided, and the
threads are scheduled by the kernel. Kernel threads can take
advantage of multiple processors; however, switching among threads
is more time-consuming because the kernel is involved.</p><p>There are also <span   class="emphasis"><em>hybrid models</em></span>, supporting
user-level and kernel-level threads. This gives the advantages of
both models to the running process. Solaris offers this kind of
model.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110c580.0x1204ea0"></a>POSIX Threads</h2></div></div><p>Threads have been standardized by the IEEE Technical
Committee on Operating Systems. The base for the POSIX standard
(POSIX 1003.1), <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Portable Operating Systems
Interface</em></span>, defines an application program interface
which is derived from UNIX but may as well be provided by any other
operating system. This standard includes a set of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Thread
Extensions</em></span> (POSIX 1003.1c). These thread extensions
provide the base standard with interfaces and functionality to
support multiple flows of control within a process. The facilities
provided represent a small set of syntactic and semantic extensions
to POSIX 1003.1 in order to support a convenient interface for
multi-threading functions.</p><p>The interfaces in this standard are specifically targeted at
supporting tightly coupled multitasking environments, including
multiprocessor systems and advanced language constructs. The
specific functional areas covered by this standard and their scopes
include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Thread management</b></span>:
creation, control and termination of multiple flows of control in
the same process under the assumption of a common shared address
space.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Synchronization
primitives</b></span>: mutual exclusion and condition variables,
optimized for tightly coupled operation of multiple control flows
within a process.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Harmonization</b></span>:
with the existing POSIX 1003.1 interfaces.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110c580.0x1205420"></a>Linux Threading</h2></div></div><p>Multi-threading capability is included in the Linux 2.0
kernel. There is an ongoing effort to refine this and make the
kernel more reentrant. The multi-thread capability is offered by
the <span   class="bold"><b>clone</b></span> system call, which
creates a new <span   class="emphasis"><em>context of execution</em></span>. This call
can be used to create a new process, a new thread or one of a range
of possibilities which doesn't fit into either of these categories.
The <span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> system call is actually a
call to clone with a specific set of values as parameters, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_create</b></span> function call could
be a call to clone with a different set of values as
parameters.</p><p>The clone system call has several flags to indicate how much
will be shared between threads. Figure 2 lists each flag.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3184f2.large.jpg"><img src="3184f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Flags of the clone System Call
</p></div></div><p>Threading capabilities are given by different threads
packages. Several threading libraries are available for Linux. All
libraries referred to in this article make use of POSIX-compliant
functionality; however, at the time of this writing, there are no
fully POSIX-compliant multi-threading libraries available for
Linux.</p><p>The libraries we have evaluated are the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Provenzano threads
(PT)</b></span>: this package offers a user-level POSIX threads
library with thread-blocking system calls
(<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>connect</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sleep</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>wait</b></span>, etc.) and a thread-safe C
library (stdio, network utilities, etc.). This implementation
currently supports basic functionality, synchronization primitives,
thread-specific data and thread attributes.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>FSU_Pthreads
(FSUT)</b></span>: this is a C library which implements user-level
POSIX threads for different operating systems: Solaris 2.x, SCO
UNIX, FreeBSD, Linux and DOS. This implementation supports thread
management, synchronization, thread-specific data, thread priority
scheduling, signals and cancellation.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>PC threads (PCT)</b></span>:
this is a user-level POSIX threads library that includes
non-blocking select, read and write. This library has runtime
configurable parameters, such as clock interrupt interval, default
thread-scheduling policy, default thread-stack size and the I/O
polling interval, among others.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>CLthreads (CLT)</b></span>.
CLthreads is a kernel-level POSIX-compliant library on top of
Linux. CLthreads uses the clone system call to take full advantage
of multiprocessor systems.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>LinuxThreads (LT)</b></span>.
LinuxThreads is an implementation of POSIX threads for Linux.
LinuxThreads provides kernel-level threads: they are created using
the clone system call, and all scheduling is done in the kernel.
This approach can take full advantage of multiprocessor systems. It
also results in a simpler, more robust thread library, especially
for blocking system calls.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110c580.0x15fe2d0"></a>Solaris Threading</h2></div></div><p>Solaris supports a hybrid model of threads&mdash;user-level and
kernel-level threads&mdash;and a POSIX-compliant library. User-level
threads are supported by the library for their creation and
scheduling, and the kernel is not aware of these threads. Solaris
defines an intermediate level of threads as well, the lightweight
process (LWP). LWPs are between user-level threads and kernel-level
threads (see Figure 3). LWPs are manipulated by the thread library.
The user-level threads are multiplexed onto the LWPs of the process
(each process contains at least one LWP), and only threads
currently connected to LWPs accomplish work. The rest are either
blocked or waiting for an LWP on which they can run.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3184f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Threads in Solaris
</p></div></div><p>There is a kernel-level thread for each LWP, and some
kernel-level threads run on the kernel's behalf and have no
associated LWP. Kernel-level threads are the only objects scheduled
within the system.</p><p>With this model, any process may have many user-level
threads. These user-level threads may be scheduled and switched
among kernel-supported lightweight processes without the
intervention of the kernel. Each LWP is connected exactly to one
kernel-level thread. Many LWPs are in a process, but they are
needed only when threads need to communicate with the kernel; if
one blocks, the others can continue to execute within the process.
In Solaris, users can create new threads permanently bound to an
LWP.</p><p>Figure 4 summarizes the user-level and kernel-level features
of the evaluated libraries.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3184f4.large.jpg"><img src="3184f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

with a dual Pentium Pro Processor. The Pentium Pro Processor is a
32-bit processor with the RISC technology. This processor uses
dynamic execution, a combination of improved branch prediction,
speculative execution and data flow analysis. The clock speed of
the computer was 200MHz, and it was equipped with 64MB of memory
and a 2GB hard disk.</p><p>The tests were all performed ten times and the mean of the
measurements was taken as the result for the test. This result is
an indication of the performance of the function being evaluated.
We have considered average values, because they are more
representative of the performance the user can obtain from the
machine. Other authors consider minimum values, because they are
supposed to be free from the influence of the operating system and
other users. The tests were taken with only one user on the
machine. All tests compared the performance obtained for Solaris
threads, Provenzano threads (PT), FSU_Pthreads (FSUT), PC threads
(PCT), CLthreads (CLT) and LinuxThreads (LT). Threads created in
Solaris are permanently bound to an LWP to take full advantage of
the hardware platform used.</p><p>The numbers presented in Figure 5 are the results of the
thread-management measurements. All values are given in
microseconds, except for granularity of parallelism where values
are given in number of iterations. In general, it can be seen that
user-level packages are more efficient than kernel-level packages
and Solaris threads, since the threads are created on top of the
operating system and are invisible to the kernel; however, these
libraries are not useful for multi-threaded applications running on
multiprocessor systems. This is true for Provenzano threads and
FSU_Pthreads, although PC threads present more time-consuming
results. Results for granularity of parallelism are shown for
kernel-level libraries (Solaris, CLthreads and LinuxThreads);
user-level libraries cannot execute multiple threads in more than
one processor. Figure 5 shows how Solaris can take better advantage
of multiprocessor architecture. Comparing thread execution and
granularity of parallelism results, we can see that context
switching is more time-consuming for Linux threading (CLthreads and
LinuxThreads) than for Solaris threading. LinuxThreads can take
better advantage of multiprocessor systems than CLthreads
can.</p><p><a href="3184f5.html" target="_self">Figure 5. Thread Management
