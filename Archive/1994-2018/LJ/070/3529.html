    If you have trouble remembering where you are going, this
    clever program can help you find your way.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1671450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Remind is a calendar and reminder program
for Linux and most UNIX Systems. I started writing Remind in 1989
because I was fed up with the limitations of the UNIX calendar
program. In the last ten years, it has accreted features and has
become one of the most sophisticated calendar programs I've seen.
I'd like to take you on a journey through the history of Remind,
demonstrating some of the features which lead me to immodestly call
it the &ldquo;Ultimate Personal Calendar&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1671558"></a>In the Beginning: Calendar</h2></div></div><p>First, let's start with the venerable UNIX
<span   class="bold"><b>calendar</b></span> program. This program
simply scans a text file for lines containing likely-looking dates.
It prints any lines containing today's or tomorrow's date (where
Monday is considered &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; relative to Friday). You can also
arrange to have reminders mailed to you.</p><p>Well, this is fine for very simple things. However, there is
no provision for repeating reminders, so you can't (for example)
remind yourself of something on the first of every month.</p><p>The next step up in sophistication is
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>. This lets you specify dates
in a relatively sophisticated format, so you can remind yourself of
daily, weekly or monthly events. Still, cron won't handle fairly
simple things like events which happen on the first Wednesday of
every month.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x16717c0"></a>The Birth of Remind</h2></div></div><p>To remedy these shortcomings, I started work on Remind. In
its simplest form, Remind is similar to calendar in that it reads a
text file and sends reminders to standard output. However, Remind
uses a sophisticated date-specification language which allows very
complex reminders to be issued. Although the language is
sophisticated, it is still quite intuitive for simple cases. Let's
look at a few examples from a Remind script file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REM 6 January MSG David's birthday.
</pre><p>That example is fairly straightforward. On January 6 each
year, it reminds me of my birthday. But suppose I need advance
warning of my wife's birthday, so I have time to buy her a present.
Try this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
REM 20 December +7 MSG Norine's birthday is %b.
</pre>


A little more complex, but still understandable: The
<b  >+7</b> means Remind starts warning me seven days
ahead of time. The <b  >%b</b> is a special substitution
sequence, and it works like this:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>On 13 December, <b  >%b</b> is replaced
with &ldquo;in 7 days time&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>On 19 December, <b  >%b</b> is replaced
with &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>On 20 December, <b  >%b</b> is replaced
with &ldquo;today&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div>

So, already we have some nice features: a selectable amount of
advanced warning and a message body which changes depending on the
&ldquo;trigger date&rdquo; of the reminder relative to today's date.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1671df0"></a>More Complex Reminders</h2></div></div><p>How about some more tricky reminders? My local Linux users'
group meets on the first Wednesday of the month. How do we express
this in Remind?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REM Wed 1 MSG OCLUG Meeting.
</pre><p>How does it work? The <b  >Wed</b> is recognized as
a weekday token, and the <b  >1</b> as a day-of-the-month
token. If both of these tokens are present, the trigger date is the
first weekday on or after the day-of-the-month. If you specify
multiple weekdays, the first matching one is used. Here are a few
more illustrations:
<pre     class="programlisting">
REM Wed MSG Issued every Wednesday.
REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri MSG Issued every working\
   day.
REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri 1 MSG Issued first\
  working day of the month.
REM Sat Sun 1 June MSG Issued first weekend day\
  in June.
</pre>


Seemingly more difficult things like the first Tuesday after the
first Monday in a month are, in fact, easy: a little thought shows
that the first Tuesday after the first Monday in a month is simply
the first Tuesday on or after the second of the month:
<pre     class="programlisting">
REM Tue 2 MSG Presto! First Tuesday-after-Monday.
</pre>


The last Monday in a month is handled like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
REM Mon 1 --7 MSG Last Monday of a month.
</pre>


This one is rather tricky: the <b  >Mon 1</b> part is the
first Monday of a month, but the <b  >--7</b> means &ldquo;go
back 7 days&rdquo;. So that reminder is triggered seven days before the
first Monday of every month&mdash;which happens to be the last Monday of
the previous month. The <b  >--n</b> sequence can solve
some thorny problems related to the &ldquo;last something in a month&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1672268"></a>Holidays</h2></div></div><p>So far, any commercial calendar package can keep up with
Remind, but now we start pulling ahead of the pack.</p><p>One of the most annoying things about most calendar programs
is how they handle holidays. Suppose you have a meeting every
Thursday, but not if it's a holiday. The typical calendar program
will go ahead and remind you anyway. Here in Canada, July 1 is a
holiday and July 1, 1999, is a Thursday. Look at this script
snippet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
OMIT 1 July MSG Canada Day.
REM Thursday SKIP MSG Meeting.
</pre><p>The OMIT line tells Remind that 1 July is a holiday, and it
also prints a nice message on that date. The SKIP token in the REM
line tells Remind to skip the reminder if it falls on a holiday.
The reminder will thus be triggered on 24 June 1999 and 8 July
1999, but not 1 July 1999.
</p><p>There are other flavours:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REM Thursday BEFORE MSG Meeting moved to preceding\
   Wednesday if Thursday is a holiday.
REM Thursday AFTER MSG Meeting moved to next\
   Friday if Thursday is a holiday.
</pre><p>Remind has fairly sophisticated mechanisms for adjusting
reminders because of holidays and weekends; please read the manual
for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1672580"></a>GUI, GUI, GUI!</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3529f1.large.jpg"><img src="3529f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Main TK Remind Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>At this point, your head may be spinning. You don't want to
learn yet another command language or obscure configuration-file
format. You pine for the GUIs your Microsoft colleagues use. No
problem; Remind comes with a graphical front end called TkRemind,
written in Tcl/Tk. TkRemind presents a graphical calendar and lets
you enter reminders with a simple graphical entry box. Figure 1
shows the main TkRemind window, and Figure 2 shows the reminder
entry box.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3529f2.large.jpg"><img src="3529f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Reminder Entry Box
</p></div></div><p>With TkRemind, you never have to learn Remind's scripting
language, as long as you can express all the reminders you need
with the GUI. However, you are encouraged to learn to script
Remind; from the GUI, just click &ldquo;Preview Reminder&rdquo; to see the
Remind code which will implement your reminder.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1672b00"></a>Timed Reminders</h2></div></div><p>The GUI also hinted at the existence of something called a
&ldquo;timed reminder&rdquo;. This is a reminder with a time of day
specified. You can arrange to have Remind pop up reminders just
before an important meeting, or more importantly, remind you to go
home.</p><p>Here's an example of a timed reminder:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REM Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri AT 17:00 +15 *3 MSG Go home!
</pre><p>The AT keyword introduces an &ldquo;AT clause&rdquo;. The
<b  >17:00</b> means that the trigger time is 5:00 PM.
The <b  >+15</b> means Remind starts carping at you
fifteen minutes ahead of time, and the <b  >*3</b> means
it annoys you every three minutes.
</p><p>The TkRemind front end runs Remind in a special &ldquo;daemon
mode&rdquo; so that timed reminders like the previous example are popped
up in X windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1a6b0c0"></a>Super Advanced Scripting</h2></div></div><p>While what we've seen so far is quite cool, there is still
the stubborn oddball reminder which requires a much tougher piece
of scripting to handle. Consider the 4th of July in the U.S. If
this falls on a Saturday, the previous Friday is a holiday. If it
falls on a Sunday, the next Monday is a holiday. Otherwise, the 4th
itself is the holiday. I won't even attempt to explain this bit of
scripting; get yourself the manual, and become a hard-core Remind
programmer.</p><p>Listing 1 illustrates several features of Remind scripting:
Remind has built-in functions (66 of them, to be precise) and
allows user-defined functions (e.g., FSET). It also has conditional
tests (e.g., IF/ENDIF). A bit of clever scripting can express
reminders which prove too tough for most calendar programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1a6b220"></a>Astronomy</h2></div></div><p>Ultimately, all calendars are derived from astronomical
observations. Remind includes routines to calculate sunrise and
sunset times for where you live, as well as moon phases. The moon
phases were illustrated in the GUI calendar. These astronomical
calculations are available as built-in Remind functions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1a6b328"></a>PostScript and HTML Output</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3529f3.large.jpg"><img src="3529f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. PostScript Output</p></div></div>
</p><p>In addition to issuing reminders on standard output or with
pop-up windows, Remind can create high-quality PostScript and HTML
calendars. The actual Remind &ldquo;engine&rdquo; knows nothing about
PostScript or HTML. Rather, if invoked with a command-line option,
it prints out reminders in a format convenient for back ends to
process. The <span   class="bold"><b>Rem2PS</b></span> back end
produces PostScript output (Figure 3) and
<span   class="bold"><b>rem2html</b></span> produces HTML output.
Remind itself can produce a passable text-only monthly
calendar.</p><p>Remind uses classic UNIX pipes to communicate with back ends.
In fact, TkRemind is a pure Tcl script which uses pipes to
communicate with a background Remind process. In this way, all the
hairy date-calculation code is contained in Remind, and the pretty
GUI and formatting code in the appropriate back end. It should be
fairly straightforward to write GNOME and KDE equivalents to
TkRemind.</p><p>In addition to sending normal reminders to back ends, Remind
can transmit &ldquo;out-of-band&rdquo; data which makes the back end do
something magical. Currently, special mechanisms are defined for
drawing moon phases and shading calendar blocks. The PostScript, Tk
and HTML back ends all respect these mechanisms. Additional back
ends can easily extend the mechanism for special purposes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1a6b7f8"></a>Francais, Espa&ntilde;ol, Deutsch...</h2></div></div><p>Not everyone speaks English. While you wouldn't know this
from most software, things are changing and software authors are
internationalizing their software. Remind is no exception; it has
been translated into twelve different European languages.
Unfortunately, this was done with a customized mechanism which does
not recognize or respect the POSIX locale functions. You have to
specify a language for Remind at compile time.</p><p>Different languages have different rules for forming plurals,
expressing times and expressing time intervals. This makes simple
message translation impossible; in some cases, the code for a
language is specific to that language alone.</p><p>Remind has been designed so translators can port it to
another language fairly easily; please see the source code for
details. If anyone would like to make Remind recognize and respect
the LC_* locale environment variables, that would be a great
project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1a6b9b0"></a>The Kitchen Sink</h2></div></div><p>Because I like to know when Jewish holidays fall, I included
Remind functions for dealing with the Hebrew calendar. If anyone
would like to contribute code for the Chinese and Muslim calendars,
I'm open to input.</p><p>Two last bits of scripting. Suppose you want to be reminded
of something every Friday the 13th. This does not work:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REM Fri 13 MSG Black Cat
</pre><p>because it would be issued on the first Friday on or after
the 13th of every month. Try this instead:
<pre     class="programlisting">
REM 13 SATISFY [wkdaynum(trigdate()) == 5] MSG\
Black Cat.
</pre>


The <b  >SATISFY</b> keyword causes Remind to iterate
through all possible &ldquo;13ths of the month&rdquo; until it hits one where
the weekday is Friday. This powerful mechanism makes very complex
reminders quite simple.
</p><p>Finally, here's some Remind code to figure out when a blue
moon occurs. A blue moon is the second full moon in a calendar
month. (Blue moons are quite rare.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FSET isFirstFull(date) \
           monnum(moondate(2, date)) == \
                monnum(moondate(2, moondate(2, date)+1))
REM 1 SATISFY isFirstFull(trigdate())
        set blue moondate(2, moondate(2,\
        trigdate())+1)\
MSG Next blue moon is [trigger(blue)]
</pre><p>Running this script through Remind shows that the next blue
moon will take place on October 31, 2001. The one after that is
July 31, 2004.
</p><p>I defy you to get Microsoft Schedule to warn you of an
upcoming blue moon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1579580.0x1a6bdd0"></a>And Still More...</h2></div></div><p>I've barely scratched the surface of Remind. For more
exciting esoteric things like system variables, priority, SCHED and
WARN, TAG and DURATION, the substitution filter, safe movable
OMITs, security features, the OMIT context, expressions, functions,
debugging features, and so on, please download Remind. It's
