on page 18, Terra Soft Solutions, Inc. is presented with the URL of
www.blacklablinux.com, which is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> our
corporate web site
(<a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com" target="_self">http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/</a>),
and again, one sentence later, our primary distribution Yellow Dog
Linux is presented with the URL of www.yellowdog.com, which is a
completely nonassociated design firm on the East Coast who then
called us and complained that Yellow Dog Linux customers are now
calling them asking for sales and support information. The correct

Red Hat, free software and open-source software. Both Cygnus and
Red Hat have long admired each other's organization and innovative
leadership in engineering, promoting and maintaining Linux
software. We are both proud of the fact that the software developed
and maintained by our companies has become fundamental to the free
software and open-source communities and is becoming fundamental to
the larger commercial markets as well. We are also mindful of the
fact that we did not get to this point alone.</p><p>Having spent a lot of time over the past few months
contemplating and discussing a possible merger, we have amicably
and willingly signed a definitive agreement to merge. To say that
we are excited about the possibilities is the understatement of the
decade. We believe by enabling developers from both companies to
work together more closely, with a common and larger purpose, we
can drive the open-source revolution faster and further than would
otherwise be possible.</p><p>We hope you will continue your support of both organizations
as one and help us move open source even further. Please don't
hesitate to e-mail us or anyone else you know at either company if
you have any questions, concerns or suggestions about how we can
make this merger a &ldquo;Good Thing&rdquo; for everybody.</p><p>&mdash;Donnie Barnes and Michael Tiemann djb@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeae608"></a>Ads, Ads, Ads</h2></div></div><p>I have been receiving <i  >Linux Journal</i> for
almost a year now, and it has drastically changed in this short
period. I am referring to the annoying ads on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> page. It seems your magazine is no
longer content-oriented, it is now <span   class="emphasis"><em>stuff</em></span>
oriented. I know you're just trying to make money, but when do you
have enough? This really bothers me, and I will probably not
resubscribe to your magazine.</p><p>&mdash;Kyle E. Wright tachyon9@purdue.edu</p><p>You are right: we do have a lot more ads now&mdash;with the growth
in Linux popularity and products, more companies are placing ads
with us. We are a major advertising spot for them. However, we have
not decreased our content pages. Instead, we have expanded the
number of pages in each issue. We are now at 132 pages, where just
a few months ago, we had only 100. (This issue, February, will have
156.) Advertising money pays for us to grow and offer you more and
better content and services for your subscription &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeae8c8"></a>USB and Linux</h2></div></div><p>I noticed an error in a letter from a Mr. Ellerby in the
November <i  >LJ</i>, which mentioned a lack of Linux
USB support.</p><p>Last Thursday (October 21, 1999) evening in Austin, TX, Mr.
David Nelson (davido@austin.rr.com) demonstrated to the Austin
Linux Users Group (ALG) a USB HP scanner and a USB camera on an
i386 Red Hat Linux machine. The camera was supplied by Jason Cohen
of Photodex Corp., producer of Compupic 4.6 beta 20.x Linux. It
worked! David's home page lists information on this topic. The URL
is
<a href="http://www.jump.net/~dnelson" target="_self">http://www.jump.net/~dnelson/</a>.</p><p>&mdash;Donn Washburn n5xwb@inetport.com</p><p>One thing to remember is the November issue came out in
mid-October before this announcement, and had been put to bed more
than a month earlier &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeaeb88"></a>Too Much Red Hat?</h2></div></div><p>I've been following your journal for about a year, and had a
look at older issues from the Web. All went well until #66. News
about Red Hat shares was okay, but now in #67, I started feeling
that these are advertisements, rather than news. If <i  >Linux Journal</i> is a &ldquo;journal&rdquo; rather than a magazine, I think
these writings should be classified as advertisements. You may say
that these help the advocation of Linux, but as long as you don't
advocate the other companies, it will look as if you're advocating
only Red Hat Linux.</p><p>I have been using Red Hat Linux for about two years, both for
servers and my desktop machine, so I have no antipathy toward Red
Hat. But I am not buying your journal with the dream of making
money on Wall Street, and I am not interested in how profitable
investing in Linux can be.</p><p>&mdash;Can Bican bican@metu.edu.tr</p><p>The upFRONT section was created so that we would have a place
to put information we felt was of interest to our readers that was
not necessarily technical. Being the first and only Linux IPO so
far, we thought people would be interested in the
numbers &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeaedf0"></a>Praise Indeed</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Hacking an Industry&rdquo; by Doc Searls in the November issue
is a very well-written and appropriate article&mdash;it is the stuff I
tend to look for and reference in <i  >Linux Journal</i>!</p><p>&mdash;Russell McOrmond russell@flora.ottawa.on.ca</p><p>May I blush? Thank you.  &mdash;Doc Searls, <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeaf058"></a>The Ties that Bind</h2></div></div><p>I just wanted to correct one error in the interview with
Guido van Rossum in your December issue. Guido thought the KDE/Qt
Python bindings weren't being actively maintained. That's just not
the case. Phil Thompson very actively develops the PyKDE/PyQt
bindings&mdash;the PyQt bindings even work with the Windows Qt. It's a
very slick tool kit, very easy to use, and since it's based on an
object-oriented tool kit, fits very neatly into the Python way of
programming.</p><p>The bindings are at
http://www.river-bank.demon.co.uk/software/, and you can find a
tutorial on my web site:
<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~bsarempt/python/tutorial.html" target="_self">www.xs4all.nl/~bsarempt/python/tutorial.html</a>.
There's also a mailing list at

1999) I've seen so far on the subject&mdash;reset that one VCR, and it
will be good for another century&mdash;that is what a lot of the answers
will be; just reset whatever needs it.</p><p>There is one more thing: in January 2000, we will start
building the Y2.1K problem. Really, it's because two-digit dates
cover a man's lifetime.</p><p>&mdash;Dan Tillmanns tillmanns@earthlink.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeaf478"></a>Hot <span   class="emphasis"><em>Damn</em></span></h2></div></div><p>I was just reading Doc Searls' &ldquo;Linux for Suits&rdquo; column in
the December <i  >LJ</i>. That's it; it's over; I can
go home now&mdash;he is generating ESR-like sound bites better than
mine. In particular:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Freedom is an efficiency that drives
value.</p></blockquote></div><p>That's so good, it gives me goosebumps. I wish I'd thought of
it first.

(Dec. '99) which has sparked my interest in Python.</p><p>Not only was the article entertaining, but he and writer Phil
Hughes confirmed my own first impressions of that other language,
Perl: &ldquo;All the speed of BASIC combined with the readability of
FORTH.&rdquo;</p><p>A quick visit to the newsgroup comp.lang.python this morning
also proved interesting: there's an attitude of helpfulness there
that is a real breath of fresh air after all the smoke and flame in
the *perl groups.</p><p>I hope <i  >LJ</i> will continue to publish
articles featuring a wide variety of programming languages. No
single language is right for everyone, so when it comes to choosing
one, a few examples from actual users with real applications can be
far more valuable than any number of man pages written by ace
programmers who list their second language as &ldquo;human&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Irv Mullins irv@ellijay.com</p></div></div>
