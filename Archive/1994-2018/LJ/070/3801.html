    Bonjour, mes amis! Welcome back to my restaurant, &ldquo;Chez
    Marcel&rdquo;. Please, sit down. Francois has prepared your usual
    table and will be along with your wine tout de suite.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228b580.0x2383500"></a></h2></div></div><p>This month's menu features &ldquo;Linux on the
Desktop&rdquo;. Your desktop, like any well-dressed table, should
reflect something of your personality. Do you use gold-edged silver
cutlery or stainless steel? Is candlelight a must for your dinners?
Are your napkins linen, cotton or paper? Most important, of course,
is to simply enjoy your meal. The well-dressed table, like the
well-dressed Linux desktop, simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>enhances</em></span>
the experience.
</p><p>Okay, I admit it; I am stretching the metaphor, but what's a
meta for if not for stretching? Fran&ccedil;ois! Better bring me a
glass, as well. As for you, my welcome guests, let me show you how
you, too, can develop a desktop theme that reflects your
personality.</p><p>On your K Desktop (I am running 1.1.2), you will find the
theme manager under the Settings/Desktop menu. Using this tool, you
can easily import new themes (see Resources for links), delete old
themes, create and modify them. Despite great strides in the
development of the theme manager, creating and modifying a theme is
still largely a command-line job. The theme manager is used
primarily to manage existing themes, a job it does very
well.</p><p>Using the theme manager, I created the skeleton for a
&ldquo;Cooking&rdquo; theme by clicking on &ldquo;Create&rdquo;. Imagine that, non!
This created a default structure for my theme in the directory
/home/marcel/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Work/Cooking. As I
mentioned, this is primarily a command-line (or editor) job. The
theme manager allowed me to save my settings and apply changes on
the fly as I worked out the details of my theme. A note of caution,
though: when you click &ldquo;Save&rdquo;, your current working directory
will be erased and rebuilt. Before clicking on &ldquo;save&rdquo;, you need
to go back a directory (<b  >cd&nbsp;..</b>) before
continuing. Once you have saved your theme and applied it, you can
safely go back into the Work/Theme_name directory.</p><p>There are several components in a theme. They include icons,
colors and fonts, borders and so on. Each of these is defined in a
.themerc file for your theme. In my case, I have a Cooking.themerc
file. The default built by the theme manager includes only the
title and author information, in the <b  >[General]</b>
section of the file. Here's what mine looked like immediately after
the Theme Manager created it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# KDE Config File
[General]
Author=Marcel Gagn&eacute;
Homepage=http://www.salmar.com
Version=0.1
description=Chez Marcel chef Marcel Gagn&eacute; brings you his Cooking with Linux theme
Email=mggagne@salmar.com
</pre><p>This is only the beginning of the template; it requires
several more sections, each with its own details: Display, Colors,
File Manager and Window Border, to name a few.
</p><p>If you feel so inclined and have a lot of wine to drink, you
can write every section of your .themerc manually. My method
involves copying the system .themerc template to the one created by
the theme manager. You can find the system template under your KDE
share directory. On an RPM system like mine, it is called
/usr/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes/Template.themerc. I use the
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> command to do the copying with
the following single line (ignore wrapping):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat /usr/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes/
Template.themerc &gt;&gt; /home/marcel/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/
Work/Cooking/Cooking.themerc
</pre><p>This gives me a complete template to work with. Using
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> to edit the file, I removed the
template's <b  >[General]</b> section and left my own in
place. For my <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cooking with Linux</em></span> theme, I used
only the Display, Window Border, Window Titlebar and Window Button
Layout sections.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x228b580.0x2383b88"></a>Getting Creative</h2></div></div><p>So, you want to create a theme, eh? Before we begin, let me
give you some quick technical notes. All of my graphics were either
created or modified using the GIMP. You could use another package
to do this, but why would you? Other than the desktop wallpaper,
which is a .jpg file, all images are in .xpm format and indexed
before saving.</p><p>In creating this recipe, I started with a background I knew
had to be food-related. A few years ago, at a very strange New
Year's party in our home, a couple of friends offered to bring a
veggie tray. This veggie tray was a joy to behold, with hard-boiled
egg islanders, carrot palm trees and mushroom huts. We were so
impressed, we took a picture of it. This was my starting point.
With a little modification in the GIMP, I added Tux, gave him a
glass of wine and sat him under a celery palm. Here are the
specifics from the <b  >[Display]</b> section.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CommonDesktop=true
Wallpaper0=aveggietray.jpg
WallpaperMode0=Centred
</pre><p>Next, I created buttons. The way I see it, when you minimize
a window, you are essentially offering it a glass of wine and
giving it a rest. What better icon than a glass of wine, non? Then
came maximizing a window to the desktop&mdash;sort of like &ldquo;spooning&rdquo;
it out onto the desktop, n'est-ce pas? Et voil&lt;\#224&gt;, a
spoon! The sticky button was obvious as well. You stab the window
with a fork and anchor it, pointing down to stick and up to unstick
(also the default position). Finally, I needed a close button, the
great <span   class="emphasis"><em>coup de gr&lt;\#226&gt;ce</em></span> that
dispatches a window. Ah, oui! A knife of the finest steel.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3801f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Icons
</p></div></div>

</p><p>All these icons form the <b  >[Window Titlebar]</b>
section. They can be up to 20 pixels in height and width. Before
finishing here, I created a pixmap for the titlebar, a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>salad</em></span> look and feel. The difference between
the active titlebar and the inactive one is brightness. Finally, I
right-aligned the text. Here is the resulting section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[Window Titlebar]
CloseButton=knife.xpm
MaximizeButton=spoon-up.xpm
MaximizeDownButton=spoon-down.xpm
MenuButton=
MinimizeButton=wine.xpm
StickyButton=fork.xpm
StickyDownButton=forkdown.xpm
TitlebarPixmapActive=saladbar.xpm
TitlebarPixmapInactive=inactivesaladbar.xpm
PixmapUnderTitleText=yes
TitleFrameShaded=no
TitleAlignment=right
</pre><p>Buttons can be positioned anywhere you wish. There are six
possible button positions: three on the left and three on the
right. Since I tend to click before I think, I decided to stay with
the default positions. However, if you are feeling dangerous, you
could switch the Iconify and Close positions. Ah, the romance of
living on the edge! Here is the section in question:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[Window Button Layout]
ButtonA=Menu
ButtonB=
ButtonC=
ButtonD=Close
ButtonE=Maximize
ButtonF=Iconify
</pre>


Window borders are a strange thing to me&mdash;I both
<span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>hate</em></span> them. On
one hand, they decorate; on the other, they take up valuable
desktop real estate on my notebook's panel display. For those times
I feel wild and foolish, I decided to throw in a flash of color to
my borders. For corner icons, I brought Tux and his wine glass
back. The resulting entry from my &ldquo;.themerc&rdquo; follows.
<pre     class="programlisting">
[Window Border]
shapePixmapTop=horizborder.xpm
shapePixmapBottom=horizborder.xpm
shapePixmapLeft=vertborder.xpm
shapePixmapRight=vertborder.xpm
shapePixmapTopLeft=tuxwine.xpm
shapePixmapTopRight=tuxwine.xpm
shapePixmapBottomLeft=tuxwine.xpm
shapePixmapBottomRight=tuxwine.xpm
</pre>


The border sections, like the window titlebar, need not be terribly
long. KDE will automatically tile your image to fill any window.
There is a catch, though, and let me tell you that I ached over
this one for quite some time. You need to make sure the borders can
line up with the corner. If you create a 20-by-20-pixel corner
icon, make sure you line it up with a 20-pixel width border.
</p><p>You know, as the Perl motto goes, &ldquo;there is more than one
way to do it&rdquo;. Clicking &ldquo;Save&rdquo; each time you make changes in the
theme manager is just one way to do it. If the constant refreshing
of your Work directory gets tiring after awhile, resort to your old
friend, the command line, and create your own lovely tar bundle.
Gzipped, bien s&ucirc;r. To simplify the image here, I will step
back a directory and back up my bundle from there. Remember, I was
in the Work/Cooking directory.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd ..
tar -czvf Cooking.tar.gz Cooking
</pre><p>This will create my Cooking.tar.gz theme bundle. The catch,
if you do it this way, is that you then need to copy the bundle
back to your ~/.kde/share/apps/kthememgr/Themes directory.
</p><p>In any case, when you are satisfied with your work, you can
upload it to your favorite theme site for all the world to savor.
It can then be installed with the theme manager using the
<span   class="bold"><b>Add</b></span> function. For your viewing
pleasure, Figure 2 is a picture of the resulting theme. Should you
be so inspired, you may download a copy from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site or from my own. Surely, fame and
fortune are then only a heartbeat away, non?</p><p>
