had intended to say something like &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, but neither
word fits&mdash;&ldquo;strange&rdquo; does.</p><p>The book is organized into eight parts with multiple chapters
plus an appendix on installing StarOffice. The first part has
general information on StarOffice. The next five parts cover
StarWriter, StarCalc, the graphics pieces of StarOffice (StarDraw,
StarImage and StarPresents), StarSchedule and StarBase. The last
two parts include how to configure StarOffice for an Internet
connection and a number of tips.</p><p>On the good side, there is a reasonable amount of useful
information to help someone new to StarOffice get up to speed. The
ideas are presented clearly, with illustrations where needed. It is
also very easy to skip to the section of interest, StarCalc for
example, and just start reading. As long as you either knew the
basics or read Part I, you should be fine.</p><p>Now, about the strange stuff. First, in spite of the book's
title, it also covers StarOffice for MS Windows. I find this a
little strange, and more importantly, distracting. When you are
reading about how to use a new application&mdash;particularly a large,
complicated one&mdash;you don't need this sort of distraction.</p><p>The next weird thing is the &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo; in the front of
the book. This is very common for this series of books, but the
content doesn't make sense. With all the possible things a reader
might want on a reference card, IDG chose to define what the icons
mean on the various toolbars. If you have ever used StarOffice, you
probably know that if you leave the mouse pointer over an icon, the
function of the icon is displayed.</p><p>The system configuration chosen by the author is also a
little odd. It is Red Hat Linux 5.2 with KDE 1.1 and StarOffice
5.1. The default Red Hat 5.2 system didn't run KDE. While
StarOffice should run with any window manager, this deviation from
the standard distribution is not explained. Also, the installation
appendix covers installing StarOffice from StarDivision, not Sun.
Things have changed significantly since Sun bought the
product.</p><p>While I am on the subject of installation, I should mention
StarOffice 5.1 automatically adds StarOffice to the KDE panel. The
author, however, has you bring up a terminal window to start
StarOffice. This makes no sense, as there is no need to associate a
terminal with the program. Even if the author didn't want to use
the icon, using the <b  >ALT-F2</b> key sequence to bring
up a command line would be more appropriate.</p><p>The author's background will shed some light on this subject.
While he has written other books and clearly has software
experience, there is no indication that he has any Linux
experience.</p><p>I have other nits to pick with the book. For example, the
&ldquo;Entering Chart Data&rdquo; for StarChart first insists that you must
manually enter all your data. Then, it goes on to show how you can
embed a chart in a StarCalc spreadsheet using the spreadsheet data.
An introductory sentence indicating an alternative was coming would
have made the reader feel much better.</p><p>In the chapter titled &ldquo;Creating and Editing Images&rdquo;, a
&ldquo;Linux-only&rdquo; note talks about file and directory permissions.
Unfortunately, it is written backwards (mixing up cause and effect)
and is also incorrect.</p><p>That's about it from my end. The book does cover a lot of
what you need to know about StarOffice, but it certainly isn't
perfect. My recommendation is to look at the other book(s)
available or wait for the second edition, which hopefully will have
been technically edited by a Linux person.</p></div></div>
