    A discussion of the operation, advantages and flaws of an
    experimental extension for the TCP protocol.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f9f9d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>T/TCP is an experimental extension for
the TCP protocol. It was designed to address the need for a
transaction-based transport protocol in the TCP/IP stack.
</p><p>TCP and UDP are the current choices available for
transaction-based applications. TCP is reliable but inefficient for
transactions, whereas UDP is unreliable but highly efficient. T/TCP
sits between these two protocols, making it an alternative for
certain applications.</p><p>Currently, several flavours of UNIX support T/TCP. SunOS
4.1.3 (a Berkeley-derived kernel) was the very first implementation
of T/TCP, and made available in September 1994. The next
implementation was for FreeBSD 2.0, released in March 1995. For my
final-year project, I implemented T/TCP for Linux at the University
of Limerick in April 1998. The source code is available at
<a href="http://www.csn.ul.ie/~heathclf/fyp" target="_self">http://www.csn.ul.ie/~heathclf/fyp/</a>.</p><p>In this article, I discuss the operation, advantages and
flaws of T/TCP. This will allow application developers to decide
when T/TCP is appropriate for networking applications. I present my
results from a comparative analysis between T/TCP and TCP, based on
the number of packets per session for each transaction. I also give
my conclusions from a case study I conducted into the possible
impact of T/TCP on the World Wide Web.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f9fc38"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>The TCP/IP reference model is a specification for a
networking stack on a computer. It exists to provide a common
ground for network developers. This allows easier interconnection
of the different vendor-supplied networks.</p><p>The most popular implementations of the transport layer in
the reference model are Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), a
connection-oriented protocol, and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), a
connectionless protocol.</p><p>Both of these protocols have advantages and disadvantages.
The two main aspects of the protocols make them useful in different
areas. Being a connectionless protocol, UDP is unreliable but fast
and useful for applications, such as DNS (Domain Name System),
where speed is preferred over reliability. TCP, on the other hand
is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol. As a result, TCP is a
slower protocol than UDP.</p><p>With the explosion of the Internet in recent years, the need
for a new specification arose. The current transport protocols were
either too verbose or not reliable enough. A protocol was needed
that was faster than TCP but more reliable than UDP. This new
protocol could reduce bandwidth and increase the speed of
transmission of data, which is very much needed at the
moment.</p><p>TCP for Transactions (T/TCP) is a possible successor to both
TCP and UDP. It is a transaction-oriented protocol based on a
minimum transfer of segments, so it does not have the speed
problems associated with TCP. By building on TCP, it does not have
the unreliability problems associated with UDP. With this in mind,
RFC1379 was published in November 1992. It discussed the concepts
involved in extending the TCP protocol to allow for a
transaction-oriented service. Some of the main points the RFC
discussed were bypassing the three-way handshake and shortening the
TIME-WAIT state from 240 seconds to 12 seconds. Eighteen months
later, RFC1644 was published, with the specification for
Transaction TCP. T/TCP cuts out much unnecessary handshaking and
error detection done by the current TCP protocol, and as a result,
increases the speed of connection and reduces the necessary
bandwidth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f9fea0"></a>Transaction Transmission Control
Protocol</h2></div></div><p>T/TCP can be considered a superset of the TCP protocol. The
reason for this is that T/TCP is designed to work with current TCP
machines seamlessly. What follows is a brief description of T/TCP
and how it differs from the current TCP standard in
operation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f9ffa8"></a>What is a Transaction?</h2></div></div><p>The term &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; refers to the request sent by a
client to a server, along with the server's reply. RFC955 lists
some of the common characteristics of transaction processing
applications:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Asymmetrical Model: the two end points take
different roles; this is a typical client-server role where the
client requests the data and the server responds.</p></li><li><p>Short Duration: normally, a transaction runs for a
short time span.</p></li><li><p>Few Data Packets: each transaction is a request for
a small piece of information, rather than a large transfer of
information both ways.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1fa0318"></a>Background to T/TCP</h2></div></div><p>The growth of the Internet has put a strain on the bandwidth
and speed of networks. There are now more users than ever, and a
more efficient form of data transfer is needed.</p><p>The absolute minimum number of packets required in a
transaction is two: one request followed by one response. UDP is
the one protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack that allows this, but
the problem is the unreliability of the transmission.</p><p>T/TCP has the reliability of TCP and comes very close to
realizing the 2-packet exchange (three in fact). T/TCP uses the TCP
state model for its timing and retransmission of data, but
introduces a new mechanism to allow the reduction in
packets.</p><p>Even though three packets are sent using T/TCP, the data is
carried on the first two, thus allowing the applications to see the
data with the same speed as UDP. The third packet is the
acknowledgment to the server by the client that it has received the
data, which is how the TCP reliability is incorporated.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1fa0528"></a>Basic Operation</h2></div></div><p>Consider a DNS system, one where a client sends a request to
a server and expects a small amount of data in return. A diagram of
the transaction can be seen in Figure 1. This diagram is very
similar to a UDP request with a saving of 66% in packets
transferred compared to TCP. Obviously, in cases where a large
amount of data is being transferred, there will be more packets
transmitted and thus a decrease in the percentage saved.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3075f1.large.jpg"><img src="3075f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Time line of T/TCP Client-Server
Transaction</p></div></div>
</p><p>Timing experiments have shown that there is a slightly longer
time required for T/TCP than for UDP, but this is a result of the
speed of the computer and not the network. As computers get more
powerful, the performance of T/TCP will approach that of
UDP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1fa0898"></a>TCP Accelerated Open</h2></div></div><p>TCP Accelerated Open (TAO) is a mechanism introduced by T/TCP
designed to cut down on the number of packets needed to establish a
connection with a host.</p><p>There are a number of new options that T/TCP introduces.
These options allow the establishment of a connection with a host
using the TAO. T/TCP uses a 32-bit incarnation number, called a
connection count (CC). This option is carried in the options part
of a T/TCP segment (see Figure 2). A distinct CC value is assigned
to each direction of an open connection. Incremental CC values are
assigned to each connection that a host establishes, either
actively or passively.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3075f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. TCP Header
</p></div></div><p>The three-way handshake is bypassed using the CC value. Each
server host caches the last valid CC value it received from each
different client host. This CC value is sent with the initial SYN
segment to the server. If the initial CC value for a particular
client host is larger than the corresponding cached value, the
property of the CC options (the increasing numbers) ensures that
the SYN segment is new and can be accepted immediately.</p><p>The TAO test fails if the CC option arriving in the SYN
segment is smaller than the last CC value received that was cached
by the host, or if a CCnew option is sent. The server then
initiates a three-way handshake in the normal TCP/IP
fashion.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1fa0c60"></a>Examples</h2></div></div><p>T/TCP can be beneficial to some of the applications that
currently use TCP or UDP. At the moment, many applications are
transaction-based rather than connection-based, but still have to
rely on TCP, along with the overhead. UDP is the other alternative,
but not having time-outs and retransmissions built into the
protocol means the application programmers have to supply the
time-outs and reliability checking themselves. Since T/TCP is
transaction-based, there is no set-up and shutdown time, so the
data can be passed to the process with minimal delay.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f975f8"></a>HTTP and RPC</h2></div></div><p>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is the method used by the World
Wide Web to access web pages. T/TCP can be used to reduce the
number of packets required.</p><p>With TCP, the transaction is accomplished by connecting to
the server (three-way handshake), requesting the file (<b  >GET
<i><tt>file</tt></i></b>), then closing the
connection (sending a FIN segment). T/TCP would operate by
connecting to the server, requesting the document and closing the
connection, all in one segment (TAO). It is obvious that bandwidth
is saved by this method.</p><p>Remote procedure calls (RPCs) also adhere to the transaction
style paradigm. A client sends a request to a server for the server
to run a function. The results of the function are then returned in
the reply to the client. There is only a tiny amount of data
transferred with RPCs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f97860"></a>DNS</h2></div></div><p>The Domain Name System is used to resolve host names into the
IP addresses that locate the host.</p><p>To resolve a domain name, the client sends a request with the
IP address or a host name to the server. The server responds with
the host name or IP address where appropriate. This protocol uses
UDP.</p><p>As a result of using UDP, the process is fast, but not
reliable. Furthermore, if the response by the server exceeds 512
bytes of data, it sends the data back to the client with the first
512 bytes and a truncated flag. The client has to resubmit the
request using TCP.</p><p>The reason for this is there is no guarantee that the
receiving host will be able to reassemble an IP datagram exceeding
576 bytes. For safety, many protocols limit the user data to 512
bytes.</p><p>T/TCP is the perfect candidate for the DNS protocol. It can
communicate at speeds approaching that of UDP, and it has the
reliability of TCP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f97ac8"></a>Testing and Analysis</h2></div></div><p>In order to investigate the benefits of this implementation
of T/TCP, it is important to test its operation, and also to
compare its operation to the original TCP/IP operation. I performed
these tests using the Linux 2.0.32 kernel with T/TCP modifications
and FreeBSD version 2.2.5, which already implements T/TCP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f97bd0"></a>Performance Analysis</h2></div></div><p>To investigate the performance of T/TCP in comparison to the
original TCP/IP, I compiled a number of executables that returned
different-sized data to the client. The two hosts involved were
elendil.ul.ie, running Linux, and devilwood.ece.ul.ie, running
FreeBSD 2.2.5. The tests were performed for ten different response
sizes in order to vary the number of segments required to return
the full response. Each request was sent 50 times and the results
were averaged. The maximum segment size in each case is 1460
bytes.</p><p>The metric used for performance evaluation was the average
number of segments per transaction. I used
<span   class="bold"><b>Tcpdump</b></span> to examine the packets
exchanged. Note that Tcpdump is not entirely accurate, since during
fast packet exchanges, it tends to drop some packets to keep up.
This accounts for some discrepancies in the results.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f97d88"></a>Number of Packets per Transaction</h2></div></div><p>Figure 3 shows the results from testing for the number of
segments for T/TCP versus the number of segments for normal TCP/IP.
It is immediately obvious that there is a savings of an average of
five packets. These five packets are accounted for in the three-way
handshake, and the packets sent to close a connection. Lost packets
and retransmissions cause discrepancies in the path of the
graph.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3075f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Number of Segments versus Size of Data Transfer
</p></div></div><p>One interesting point about the average number of segments
when using a TCP client and a T/TCP server is that there is still a
saving of one segment. A normal TCP transaction requires nine
segments, but because the server was using T/TCP, the FIN segment
was piggybacked on the final data segment, reducing the number of
segments by one. This demonstrates a reduction in segments, even if
only one side is T/TCP-aware.</p><p>Figure 4 shows the percentage savings for the different
packet sizes. The number of packets saved remains fairly constant,
but because of the increase in the number of packets being
exchanged, there is a decrease in the overall savings. This
indicates that T/TCP is more beneficial to small data
exchanges.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3075f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Percentage Savings per Size of Data Transfer
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f982b0"></a>Memory Issues</h2></div></div><p>The main memory drain in the implementation is in the routing
table. In Linux, for every computer with which the host comes into
contact, an entry for the foreign host is made in the routing
table. This applies to both a direct connection and to a multi-hop
route. This routing table is accessed through the rtable structure.
The implementation of T/TCP adds two new fields to this structure,
CCrecv and CCsent.</p><p>The entire size of this structure is 56 bytes, which isn't a
major memory hog on a small stand-alone host. On a busy server,
though, where the host communicates with maybe thousands of other
hosts an hour, it can be a major strain on memory. Linux has a
mechanism where a route no longer in use can be removed from
memory. A check is run periodically to clean out unused routes and
those that have been idle for a time.</p><p>The problem here is the routing table holds the TAO cache. So
anytime a route which contains the last CC value from a host is
deleted, the local host has to re-initiate the three-way handshake
with a CCnew segment.</p><p>The benefits of leaving the routing entries up permanently
are clear. The most likely use would be in a situation where a host
talks to only a certain set of foreign hosts and denies access to
unknown hosts. In this case, it is advantageous to keep a permanent
record in memory so the three-way handshake can be bypassed more
often.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f984c0"></a>Protocol Analysis</h2></div></div><p>The original protocol specification (RFC1644) labeled T/TCP
as an experimental protocol. Since the RFC was published, there
hasn't been an update to the protocol to fix some of the problems.
From the previous sections, the benefits over the original TCP
protocol are obvious, but is it a case of the disadvantages
outweighing the advantages?</p><p>One of the more serious problems with T/TCP is that it opens
up the host to certain Denial of Service attacks. SYN flooding (see
<a href="http://www.sun.ch/SunService/technology/bulletin/bulletin963.html" target="_self">www.sun.ch/SunService/technology/bulletin/bulletin963.html</a>
for more information) is the term given to a form of
denial-of-service attack where the attacker continually sends SYN
packets to a host. The host creates a sock structure for each SYN,
thus reducing the number of sock structures that can be made
available to legitimate users. This may eventually result in the
host crashing when enough memory has been used. SYN cookies were
implemented in the Linux kernel to combat this attack. SYN cookies
cause problems with T/TCP, as there are no TCP options sent in the
cookie, and any data arriving in the initial SYN can't be used
immediately. The CC option in T/TCP does provide some protection on
its own, but it is not secure enough.</p><p>Another serious problem discovered during research was that
attackers can bypass rlogin authentication. An attacker creates a
packet with a false IP address in it, one that is known to the
destination host. When the packet is sent, the CC options allow the
packet to be accepted immediately and the data passed on. The
destination host then sends a SYNACK to the original IP address.
When this SYNACK arrives, the original host sends a reset, as it is
not in a SYN-SENT state. This happens too late, as the command will
already have been executed on the destination host. Any protocol
that uses an IP address as authentication is open to this sort of
attack. (See
<a href="http://geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_2/0020.html" target="_self">geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_2/0020.html</a>.)</p><p>It should be noted, however, that the use of T/TCP in
conjunction with protocols such as HTTP have fewer security
problems, due to the inability to run any server commands with
HTTP.</p><p>RFC1644 also has a duplicate transaction problem. This can be
serious for applications that are non-idempotent (repeat
transactions are very undesirable). This error can occur in T/TCP
if a request is sent to a server and the server processes the
transaction, but before it sends back an acknowledgment, the
process crashes. The client side times out and retransmits the
request; if the server process recovers in time, it can repeat the
same transaction. This problem occurs because the data in a SYN can
be immediately passed to the process, rather than in TCP where the
three-way handshake has to be completed before data can be used.
The use of two-phase commits and transaction logging can eliminate
this problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f987d8"></a>Case Study: T/TCP Performance over Suggested
HTTP Improvements</h2></div></div><p>With the World Wide Web being the prime example of
client-server transaction processing today, this section will focus
on the benefits of T/TCP to the performance of the Web.</p><p>Currently, the HTTP protocol sits in the application layer of
the TCP/IP reference model. It uses the TCP protocol to carry out
all its operations, UDP being too unreliable. Much latency is
involved in the transfer of information, i.e., the three-way
handshake and explicit shutdown exchanges.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f98938"></a>Web Document Characteristics</h2></div></div><p>In a survey of 2.6 million web documents searched by the
Inktomi web crawler search engine (see
<a href="http://inktomi.berkeley.edu" target="_self">http://inktomi.berkeley.edu/</a>),
it was found that the mean document size on the Web was 4.4KB, the
median size was 2.0KB and the maximum size encountered was
1.6MB.</p><p>Referring to Figure 4, it can be seen that the lower the
segment size, the better the performance of T/TCP over normal
TCP/IP. With a mean document size of 4.4KB, this results in an
average savings of just over 55% in the number of packets. When
taking the median size into account, there is a savings of
approximately 60%.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f98af0"></a>Suggested Performance Improvements for
HTTP</h2></div></div><p>At the moment, all web pages are transferred in plaintext
form, requiring little work from either the server side or the
client side to display the pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f98bf8"></a>Compression</h2></div></div><p>In their paper &ldquo;Network Performance Effects of HTTP/1.1,
CSSI and PNG&rdquo; (see Resources), the authors investigated the effect
of introducing compression to the HTTP protocol. They found that
compression resulted in a 64% savings in the speed of downloading,
with a 68% decrease in the number of packets required. Over normal
TCP/IP, this brings the packet exchanges and size of data down to
the level where T/TCP becomes beneficial. Thus, a strategy
involving both compression and T/TCP can result in enormous savings
in time and bandwidth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f98d00"></a>Delta Encoding</h2></div></div><p>In this situation, a delta refers to the difference between
two files. On UNIX systems, the
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> command can be used to
generate the delta between two files. Using the changed file and
the delta, the original file can be regenerated again and vice
versa.</p><p>J. C. Mogul, et al. (see Resources) investigated the effect
that delta encoding has on the Web. In their testing, they not only
used delta encoding, they also compressed the delta generated to
further reduce the amount of information transferred. They
discovered that by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>vdelta</b></span> delta generator and
compression, they could achieve up to 83% savings in the
transmission of data.</p><p>If this method was used with T/TCP, there could be as much as
a further 66% savings in packets transferred. This is a total of
94% reduction in packet transfer.</p><p>It should be noted, however, that this is a best-case
scenario. In this situation, the document will already have been
cached on both the server and the client side, and the client and
server will previously have completed the three-way handshake in
order to facilitate the TAO tests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x1f98fc0"></a>Socket Programming under T/TCP</h2></div></div><p>Programming for T/TCP is slightly different using socket
programming. As an example, the chain of system calls to implement
a TCP client would be as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>socket</b></span>: create a
socket.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>connect</b></span>: connect
to the remote host.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>: write data
to the remote host.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>shutdown</b></span>: close
one side of the connection.</p></li></ul></div><p>Whereas with T/TCP, the chain of commands would be:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>socket</b></span>: create a
socket.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sendto</b></span>: connect,
send data and close connection. The sendto function must be able to
use a new flag <b  >MSG_EOF</b> to indicate to the kernel
that it has no more data to send on this connection.</p></li></ul></div>

Programming under T/TCP is much like programming under UDP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea7580.0x22acdf8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Analysis of T/TCP shows that it benefits small,
transaction-oriented transfers more than large-scale information
transfers. Aspects of transactions can be seen in such cases as the
World Wide Web, Remote Procedure Calls and DNS. These applications
can benefit from the use of T/TCP in efficiency and speed. T/TCP
reduces on average both the numbers of segments involved in a
transaction and the time taken to complete the transaction.</p><p>As T/TCP is still an experimental protocol, there are
problems that need to be addressed. Security problems encountered
include the vulnerability to SYN flood attacks and rlogin
authentication bypassing. Operational problems include the
possibility of duplicate transactions occurring. Problems that
occur less frequently would be the wrapping of the CC values on
high-speed connections, thus opening up a destination host to
accepting segments on the wrong connection.</p><p>Many people recognize the need for a protocol that favors
transaction-style processing and are willing to accept T/TCP as the
answer. Security considerations lead to the conclusion that T/TCP
would be more useful in a controlled environment, one where there
is little danger from a would-be attacker who can exploit the
weaknesses of the standard. Examples of enclosed environments would
be company intranets and networks protected by firewalls. With many
companies seeing the Web as the future of doing business, internal
and external, a system employing T/TCP and some of the improvements
to HTTP, such as compression and delta encoding, would result in a
dramatic improvement in speed within a company intranet.</p><p>Where programmers are willing to accept T/TCP as a solution
to their applications, only minor modifications are needed for the
application to become T/TCP-aware. For client-side programming, it
involves the elimination of the connect and shutdown function
calls, which can be replaced by adding the
<b  >MSG_EOF</b> flag to the sendto command. Server-side
modifications involve simply adding the
<span   class="bold"><b>MSG_EOF</b></span> flag to the send
function.</p><p>Research into T/TCP suggests it is a protocol that is nearly,
but not quite, ready to take over transaction processing for
general usage. For T/TCP alone, more work needs to be done to
develop it further and solve the security and operational problems.
Security problems can be solved using other authentication
protocols such as Kerberos and the authentication facilities of
IPv6. Operational problems can be dealt with by building greater
transaction reliability into the applications that will use T/TCP,
such as two-phase commits and transaction logs.</p><p>Applications can be easily modified to use T/TCP when
available. Any applications which involve an open-close connection
can use T/TCP efficiently, and the more prominent examples would be
web browsers, web servers and DNS client-server applications. To a
smaller extent, applications such as
<span   class="bold"><b>time</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>whois</b></span> can benefit from T/TCP as
well. Many networking utilities are available that can take
advantage of the efficiency of the protocol. All that is needed is
the incentive to do it.</p><p>Perhaps a more immediate task, though, is to port the T/TCP
code to the new Linux kernel series,
