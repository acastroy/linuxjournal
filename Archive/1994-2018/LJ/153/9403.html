Evaluating two very different GUI libraries, Qtopia and Nano-X.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x231f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this article, we look at two GUI libraries, examine the
differences and give some advice on when to choose each.
</p><p>
The company I work for is dedicated to helping customers make the
right decision about the technology they want to use in their embedded
software development, and afterward it supports them in using the chosen
technology.  My specialty is embedded Linux.
</p><p>
Talking with customers, I see that more and more products need some sort
of graphical display.
So, I decided it was time to gain more knowledge about GUI development
on embedded Linux.
</p><p>
The path I chose was the practical one.  I did some
research and found that the most common libraries are
Qtopia (also known as Qt
embedded) and Nano-X (formerly known as
Microwindows).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x231f450"></a>
How to Test</h2></div></div><p>
The first solution is simply to implement some test app to demonstrate
the two GUI libs.  Such &ldquo;test apps&rdquo; only seldom
resemble a real-world application, but I do this mostly because I am an engineer,
and engineers are more interested in the technology beneath than in
the appearance.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Then why have an engineer test the libraries?&rdquo;, you might
ask.  Well, think
of GUI libraries as the technology to make an appearance.  Therefore,
you need both the technology view and the appearance view.
</p><p>
Another aspect of me doing this test is that I am not involved in any of
the projects, and therefore I come with the knowledge that most other
programmers have when they start out using the libraries.  Some of my
choices regarding the implementation probably are not optimal.  They
are made from the information available to the common user of the
library&mdash;such as the problem with the scrolling graph, discussed
below.
</p><p>
So, before ranting at me about how I could have done things differently,
please look in the docs.  Are they clear about the matter? If not, maybe
it is better to change the docs instead.
</p><p>
I decided to get some external inspiration and went to the nearby
university, where they have a department educating in User Centered
Design (UCD).  I asked one of the students, Esti Utami Handarini Povlsen
(who was an old friend of mine), to come up with a GUI specification
that I would then implement, using the two libraries.  After having
calibrated our technical language so we could communicate, we found a
suitable design that I took to my home to implement.
</p><p>
The design that I got was for a Personal Mobile Medical Device (PMMD).  The
design consists of a single window with some static buttons and a changing
display area showing text and/or graphs.
</p><p>
It turns out that the most challenging part is the heartbeat monitor
graph,
which is a varying line scrolling across the screen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x231f818"></a>
The Target Device</h2></div></div><p>
The platform I used for the evaluation is the MIPS32-based mb1100
from Mechatronic Brick.  The mb1100 development kit is
equipped with an AMD Alchemy au1100 CPU, a 6.5" TFT screen, an ADS7846E
four-wire touch screen, 32MB of RAM and 32MB of Flash.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x231f920"></a>
Qtopia</h2></div></div><p>
I started out with the Qtopia library.  The creator of Qtopia is the
Norwegian company Trolltech.  Trolltech is mostly known for its Qt
library on desktop computers; Qt is the base GUI of KDE.  Qtopia is the
embedded version of the Qt library.
</p><p>
Both Qt and Qtopia are dual-licensed, under the GPL and a commercial
license.  You can download the GPL version from the Trolltech Web site and use it
as any other GPL library.  This forces your Qt/Qtopia applications to go
under the GPL too.  You also can choose to buy the commercial license,
which allows you to make closed source applications.  The differences
between
the two versions are minor, if any, except of course for the licenses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x231fa80"></a>
Getting It Up and Running</h2></div></div><p>
Qtopia can run directly on the framebuffer device, so make sure
that the kernel is compiled with framebuffer support and that it is working.
</p><p>
That is the easy part.  The difficult part is making the touch screen
work.  After having corrected a few glitches in the driver, I had a lot
of trouble calibrating the device in Qtopia.
</p><p>
I am using Qtopia with tslib for the touch screen, and after having
corrected the driver, tslib was working, and the little calibration
program included in the tslib package calibrated well.  Drawing lines
with the pen in the same program worked fine.  After starting a Qtopia
program, the calibration was gone, and I tried the calibration program
from the Qtopia package with no luck.
</p><p>
I found the error when looking in the sources of Qtopia and tslib.  When
tslib starts up, it looks into a file in /etc.  This file tells tslib what
modules to load, and those modules usually include the linearization
module and different noise filters.
</p><p>
The linear module is the one that does the calibration.  When looking in
the sources of Qtopia, I found that the programmer wanted to make sure
that the linear module was loaded, so after parsing the tslib config file,
Qtopia loads the linear module, regardless of what is written in the config
file.  This means that if the linear module is defined in the config file,
it is loaded twice, and this breaks the functionality.  Having figured
this out, I removed the linear module from the config file.  (I know the
correct solution would be to correct the Qtopia sources, but I took the
shortcut.) Now the calibration worked in Qtopia.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x231fce8"></a>
Programming in Qtopia</h2></div></div><p>
I will not go into detail about the implementation of my application,
as it is not within the scope of this article.  However, to summarize,
Qtopia is C++-based, and I think the Qtopia designers have a good grasp
of the idea of C++.  As is no surprise, all widgets are objects, and to have
standard functions (methods) in your own widgets (defined in your own
class), you inherit from base classes.
</p><p>
The different objects (widgets) need to communicate.  For example, if I click on
a button, the button object might want to tell the text field object to
update the text.  In Qt, and thereby Qtopia, this is done using signals and
slots.  They are simply standard methods with an attribute.  This interface
makes it possible to make the objects independent of each other.  The
button just sends a signal, &ldquo;clicked&rdquo;, the text object has a slot
&ldquo;update&rdquo;, and they compile and work fine without each other.  Then,
when I put them together in my app and give the connect (obj1,
clicked, obj2, update) command in the initialization to connect signal
clicked with slot update, the magic happens.  The text is
updated when I click the button.
</p><p>
Those connections even can be made automatically, simply by giving them the
right name.  If I have a widget named cancelBtn, with the signal
clicked, and I make a slot named on_cancelBtn_clicked, the
clicked signal from the cancelBtn is automagically connected to this
slot.  This signal/slot design makes the code easy to read and maintain.  On
the other hand, if you are not familiar with signals and slots, and you
look at someone else's code, you can go on a wild goose chase looking
for the calling of the slot (method) for a long time.

Documentation</h2></div></div><p>
So far, the documentation has been a great help.  They have done a great
job writing the documentation of the API.  However, the API documentation
does not help you if you don't know what API call you should use for
a task.  I spent a lot of time making the drawing object work correctly,
because I had to collect the information from different places in the
documentation.  I never found an efficient way to make my scrolling
graph.  I did not find any bitmap manipulation that would scroll my
heartbeat graph, so I chose to repaint the whole thing for every scroll
step.  There might be an easier way, but I did not find it.
</p><p>
Therefore, if you want to do more advanced programming in Qtopia, you
need to find a good book or guide to complement the API documentation.

Nano-X</h2></div></div><p>
Nano-X was formerly known as Microwindows.  Why the change of name? Take
a wild guess.  If your guess includes a lawyer, you are probably on the
right track.
</p><p>
Nano-X is an open-source project at Nano-X.org, started and still headed
by Greg Haerr.  Nano-X is licensed under the MPL license.  The MPL license allows
you to create closed source drivers and applications.  But, the Nano-X
source itself must stay open.  There is an option to use the GPL license,
if desired.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x23203c8"></a>
Getting It Up and Running</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux package from Mechatronic Brick includes the Nano-X library,
but this version did not include support for PNG pictures.  I needed PNG
support, so I had to recompile.  This was quite easy after I found out
what config file is used when building in the Mechatronic Brick setup.  I
noticed that Nano-X comes with a config file that set up Nano-X to be
built with TCC, a small and very fast C-only compiler.  I decided to use
this too, and then the library was compiling in no time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2227580.0x23204d0"></a>
Programming in Nano-X</h2></div></div><p>
Starting to program in Nano-X is quite a change, especially when coming from the
nice and polished C++ classes of Qtopia.  Nano-X is so much simpler,
which leaves a lot more work for the application programmer.
</p><p>
Nano-X does not have widgets, or buttons or combo boxes&mdash;only
windows.  There are libraries to put on top of Nano-X that will give you
more features, such as Nano-X's own reimplementation of the win32 library
and
the Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK).  In this article, we delve into the basic
part of Nano-X.
</p><p>
Basically, when programming for Nano-X, you do four things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create windows.
</p></li><li><p>
Paint in the windows.
</p></li><li><p>
Select event types for each window.
</p></li><li><p>
Wait for an event (the event loop).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
A typical standard application window is made of a base window with the
frames and the small x close button (of course, there are options to
customize this look).  Subwindows act as buttons and display fields.  Yes,
in Nano-X, a button is declared like a subwindow with the mouse-click
event selected.
</p><p>
In Qtopia, I simply made a class, connected some signals and slots, and
puff, the magic happened.  In Nano-X, I had to take care of things
myself.  A
central part of a Nano-X application is the event loop, typically a for
(ever) loop containing the get event function and a case structure to
handle the event (see Listing 1 for an example).  When I get a mouse-click
event, I ask which window captured this event and act from that.  This
means that the single button is not isolated in its own piece of code,
but weaves into the app.  The basic function of the button or the display
field should of course be in a function by itself, but the event loop
must be aware of which events are selected in the button and what to do
with the events.

  }

Documentation</h2></div></div><p>
The documentation for Nano-X is a bit lacking.  There are some great
documents out there; however, the links from the Web page are not
updated, and many of them are dead.  I used Google to find the most
useful documentation.  One also can use the Nano-X source and the mailing
lists.  The mailing list is very active, and Greg Haerr is right there, giving
quick responses to questions.
</p><p>
A make doc in the sources will make some doc on the API using Doxygen,
but not all functions are documented.  I had to look directly in the
source a few times.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Nano-X does win by miles when it comes to size.  However, Qtopia is
far ahead when it comes to polished graphics and nice, well-structured
programming.
Don't get me wrong, this is not entirely a C vs. C++ issue.
You can do nice programming using C and Nano-X, but it does require
more skill and discipline from the programmer.  Hard-core C programmers
will often crank out muddy C++ code with Qtopia, so C++ doesn't always
translate into good practices&mdash;it all depends on your existing skills,
time and willingness to learn.
</p><p>
Regarding speed, I did not see much difference, except in my scrolling
graph.  Using Qtopia, the graph was jittery, because I did not find a way
actually to scroll the bitmap, so I had to redraw the complete graph for
each step.  The graph turned out nicely in Nano-X, using a bitmap copy to
make the scrolling, and then just drawing the new part of the graph.
Given more
time and trial and error, it is likely that you could scroll more efficiently
in Qtopia too&mdash;probably by sub-classing the right object.  But given the
current documentation, I did not find a way to do it.
