Howdy.  My husband is Chester Gnull and I'm Laverta Voyd, and I'm the
lady to light a way for all you sweethearts out there who do fancy
stuff with Linux.  Me and my husband's gonna be bringing you tech tips
just about every month now.  I reckon you and yours are wondering why my
husband's and me's last names don't match.  Well, Chester don't like much
in the way of attention, so he got the editor to change our last names
so's we don't get no pesky e-mails or people messin' with us in real life.
</p><p>
I don't know nothing about Linux.  Chester, he's the smart one, but he's
not much of a talker.  That's why I'm here.  He don't do nothing without
me, and I don't mind much cause I like talkin' and I like hosting.  Chester
don't understand why we gotta talk at all, but that's what the editor
wants, and well, he's paying us, so we figure there ain't nothing wrong with
that.  So those <i  >LJ</i> folks are gonna send us the tips, my Chester does the
pickin' and I do the hosting.  And, I say, I do love hosting, but seeing as
this here's just writing stuff, we ain't gonna be serving up none of my
specials like biscuits and gravy with sausage and real maple syrup,
and it's all homemade but the maple syrup.  But they tell me the tips
are just as tasty to you Linux folk.  That don't make much sense to me,
but Chester says that's how it is and I believe my Chester.
</p><p>
Now honeys, we got some tips to start.  One tip is by the editor to get
things rolling.  He don't get no $100 but I figure he gets enough just
being editor.  So, we want you to send us some of your tips.  If we put
your tech tip in this here column, you get $100.  We know that ain't
gonna get you no Fleetwood mobile home, and I'm talkin Park Models,
not even them fancy Entertainer Models with two bathrooms.  But $100
will get you some good eats at your local Piggly Wiggly.  So send them
tips in, sweethearts, and we'll appreciate it real nice.  You send 'em
on in to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> and the editors will pass 'em on to
Chester for ya, and we'll do the rest.

Modify initrd to Make 3ware RAID the First Serial Device</h2></div></div><p>

You can install a RAID card in your PC and configure the BIOS to
make the BIOS consider the RAID card to be the first SCSI device on
your system.  But, Ubuntu (and probably other distributions) do not
necessarily respect your BIOS settings.  For example, I have an ASUS
M2N32 WS Professional motherboard, which includes a PCI-X slot for the
3ware 9550SX-4LP RAID card.  I can set the BIOS to make this card the
first device.  However, if I add a SATA drive, the Ubuntu initrd will
see the onboard SATA as the first SCSI device on the system, in spite
of the BIOS settings.
</p><p>
There may be a kernel boot parameter to override this behavior, but I
haven't found one that works.  Regardless, I like the following solution
if for no other reason than it teaches one how to extract, modify an
Ubuntu initrd and then reassemble it for use.
</p><p>
Here's why the Ubuntu initrd defies the BIOS settings.  The initrd for
Ubuntu runs the script shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1091580.0x11898c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

# initramfs local-top script for udev

{
        echo "$PREREQ"

if [ -x /sbin/usplash_write ]; then
    /sbin/usplash_write "TIMEOUT 540"
    trap "/sbin/usplash_write 'TIMEOUT 15'" 0
fi

# Load drivers for storage controllers found on the
# PCI bus; these show up the same for both IDE and
# SCSI so there's no point differentiating between
# the two.  Do it in serial to try to provide some
# predictability for which wins each time.
/sbin/udevplug -s -Bpci -Iclass=0x01*

# We also need to load drivers for bridges (0x06),
# docking stations (0x0a), input devices (0x09),
# serial devices (0x0c) and "intelligent" devices
# (0x0e).  This is both to support filesystems on the
# end and just in case there's a keyboard on the end
# and things go wrong.
/sbin/udevplug -Bpci -Iclass=0x0[69ace]*

# If we're booting from IDE, it might not be a PCI
# controller, but might be an old-fashioned ISA
# controller; in which case we need to load ide-generic.
/sbin/modprobe -Qb ide-generic
/sbin/udevplug -W</pre></div><p>
The following line, which discovers storage controllers, happens to
discover the NVIDIA SATA first:</p><pre     class="programlisting">/sbin/udevplug -s -Bpci -Iclass=0x01*</pre><p>
You can force this script to find the 3ware controller first by adding a
line that explicitly loads the 3ware module before this line.  Listing 2
shows how
to modify the script to do that (Listing 2 is only an excerpt from the relevant
part of the script).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1091580.0x1189b88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Add the line to discover the 3ware card first.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">/sbin/modprobe 3w-9xxx

# Load drivers for storage controllers found on the
# PCI bus; these show up the same for both IDE and
# SCSI, so there's no point differentiating between
# the two.  Do it in serial to try to provide some
# predictability for which wins each time.
/sbin/udevplug -s -Bpci -Iclass=0x01*</pre></div><p>
This forces the script to discover the 3ware RAID card first and assign
it as /dev/sda before udevplug discovers the rest of the PCI storage
controllers.
</p><p>
The trick here is that you need to unpack the default initrd file that
comes with Ubuntu, modify this script, and then repack it and use it
instead of the default initrd.
</p><p>
Here's one way to do that.  These instructions assume you are using Ubuntu
Dapper AMD64 with the kernel 2.6.15-27-amd64-generic.  If you're using
some other kernel, you must change the command accordingly.  You can be
more careful than I have been with these instructions and use sudo for
all the appropriate commands.  However, I jumped into a root shell with
the <tt  >sudo -s -H</tt> command to make this easier to
read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ sudo -s -H
(enter password)
# cd /root
# mkdir initrd-tmp
# cd initrd-tmp
# gzip -dc /boot/2.6.15-27-amd64-generic | cpio -id</pre><p>
This unpacks your initrd so that you can manipulate its contents.
Now, edit this file.  (Use whichever editor suits you.  I am using vi as
an example.)</p><pre     class="programlisting"># vi scripts/local-top/udev</pre><p>
This is the file that contains the code in Listing 1.  Add the modprobe
command as shown in Listing 2.  Save the file.
</p><p>
All this assumes that the module 3w-9xxx exists in your initrd.  If it
doesn't, or you need some other module in your initrd, you'll have to
copy it to the following location (once again, this assumes you are using
the 2.6.15-27-amd64-generic kernel&mdash;modify as necessary for your
setup):</p><pre     class="programlisting"># cp &lt;module&gt; /root/initrd-tmp/lib/modules/
&#8618;2.6.15-27-amd64-generic/kernel/drivers/scsi</pre><p>
Now you need to repack the initrd file.  I suggest that you name this
initrd something other than the original, so that if you have done
something wrong, you can revert to the original easily.
</p><p>
Here is how to repack the file to a new initrd.  This assumes your current
working directory is still /root/initrd-tmp:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># find . | cpio --quiet --dereference -o -H newc | gzip
 &#8618;-9 &gt; /boot/2.6.15-27-amd64-generic-3w</pre><p>
Now change your bootloader to add another boot option to use the new
initrd file.  You can replace the existing boot entry, but that's asking
for trouble (although GRUB, for example, lets you edit a boot entry at
boot time, so there's always hope if you use GRUB).  If you use GRUB,
specify the modified initrd as the initrd image, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">initrd    /boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-27-amd64-generic-3w</pre><p>
Reboot, and try it out.
</p><p>
This should work for cards other than the 3ware if you are having the
same problem with another RAID card (or even some other storage card).
All you have to do is change /sbin/modprobe to load the appropriate module
for your card.  Don't forget to check to see whether the driver module exists
in the unpacked initrd before you pack it again.

Knoppix Does More Than Show Off Linux to Windows Users</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Your computer won't boot because you been using one of them unofficial
kernels, I bet.  That'll get you in a heap of trouble.  It's yer own
fault.  Boot a Linux live CD to fix the damage you
did.
&mdash;Chester</em></span>
</p><p>
It happens to the best of us, you sit at your computer in the morning,
turn it on, and find that it won't boot properly.  After an hour of
troubleshooting, diagnostics and grumbling, you come to the conclusion
that something about your hard drive is toast.  You think of all the files
you may have just lost in the process and curse the fact that you didn't
back up diligently enough.
</p><p>
Most of the time when your OS is dead, your files are still intact on
the drive; you just have to find a way to get to them.  In some cases,
your problem may be that the root partition is too corrupted to mount
it, but not so corrupt that you can't restore it.  For example, your
root partition may be formatted as XFS, and all you need to do is run
a utility like xfs_repair on the partition to get things back in order.
</p><p>
Some distributions come with a repair disk, and some installation disks
have a repair option.  But, you might find it more useful to boot to
a live CD to make repairs, because a live CD may put more utilities
at your disposal than a repair disk.  Knoppix is one of many live CD
versions of Linux that runs straight from the CD and allows you access
to the hard drives.
</p><p>
Even if you are in a worst-case scenario and have to recover individual
files, all you need to recover files, or possibly the entire contents of
the hard drive, is a copy of Knoppix (or your favorite live CD distro)
and a portable hard drive, jump drive or some other kind of USB portable
storage device.  Or, if you have an unused SATA or IDE spot in your system,
you always can open up the computer and plug in the extra drive (properly
configured, of course).  If you go portable, then how big the portable
storage device is depends on how much you want to save.
</p><p>
Double-check the BIOS on your target computer to make sure it is set to
boot from a CD.  If your BIOS allows you to interrupt the boot sequence
with the Esc key, F8, or some other key in order to choose which drive
to boot, you may not even have to reconfigure your BIOS.  Regardless,
boot from CD, and Knoppix should boot up automatically into the desktop.
</p><p>
Once in the desktop, all that's left to do is search the computer's hard
drive and find the files to salvage and transfer to your portable media
device or additional internal device.  Finding the files will require
that you know where the file is on the hard drive, and this will
be more or less difficult depending on the filesystem on the drive that
was corrupted.

Finding Disk Space and inode Hogs</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I knowed somebody was gonna get to this problem sooner or
later.  You
get too many inodes on your system, and you're asking for another heap
of trouble.  This tells you how to find out and fix
it.
&mdash;Chester</em></span>
</p><p>
One of the most common tasks of a system administrator is storage
management.  When you're faced with a full or almost full filesystem, it's
good to have a few tools at your disposal to help figure out
&ldquo;where&rdquo; the
hog is.
</p><p>
Searching for space hogs is very easy.  With one simple command you
can total up the contents of every directory in a tree (/usr in this
case) and see which are the largest:</p><pre     class="programlisting">du -k /usr/ |sort -n |tail -30

167156  /usr/include
168960  /usr/share/icons
173972  /usr/share/texmf
244332  /usr/bin
263144  /usr/lib/openoffice.org2.0
265492  /usr/share/doc
344536  /usr/share/locale
1223992 /usr/lib
1959412 /usr/share
4159996 /usr/</pre><p>
As you can see, /usr/share/ and /usr/lib/ are pretty big, and you can
drill down further by going up the list.
</p><p>
A somewhat rarer situation is running out of inodes in a filesystem.  In
this case, you will see available space, but the system will be unable to
write new files because it has run out of inodes.  To find inode hogs,
use this quick Perl script named inodu:</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/usr/bin/perl -w

my $start=$ARGV[0];

foreach $object (`find '$start'`){
        my @parts=split(/\//,$object);
        while(pop(@parts)  ){
                my $object = join('/',@parts);
                $object =~ s/\/+/\//g;
                $object2qty{$object}++;
        }
}

foreach $object (sort { $object2qty{$a} &lt;=&gt; $object2qty{$b} }
                         keys %object2qty){
        print $object2qty{$object} . "\t${object}\n";

}</pre><p>
This will total up the number of filesystem objects in each directory
and supply an output much like the previous example.  Use it like this:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">cd /usr

./inodu .

10420   ./include
10973   ./share/texmf
12012   ./share/man
13207   ./share/doc
14953   ./share/icons
16481   ./src/kernels
17201   ./src
22982   ./lib
105527  ./share
174270  .
174271</pre><p>
As you can see, again share and lib are the inode hogs using more than
100,000 inodes!
</p><p>
If you find yourself in any of these situations, there are a number
of ways to create more free space or inodes.  First, look for log
files that can be purged, moved or compressed.  Ask users to clean
up their home directories.  Remove any unnecessary software.  If you
are using Linux LVM and ext3fs, you can expand the filesystem using
lvresize and resize2fs to grow a filesystem.  This creates more free
space and inodes, but only if you have free space in your volume group.
If you have free disk space, you can create a new partition (for, say,
your /var tree), move the files to that partition and mount it as /var.
As a last resort, you can move files and directories and use symlinks
so the old path still works.  I say &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; because this method
can get out of hand very quickly and can make things very confusing.
