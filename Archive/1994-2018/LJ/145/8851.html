Run your favorite PlayStation games on Linux with PCSX.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article focuses on Sony PlayStation games and the PCSX
PlayStation Emulator. I chose this particular system because you can
find PlayStation games both on-line and in game stores, primarily in the
Used section.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f4a8"></a>
Getting and Installing PCSX</h2></div></div><p>
To get PCSX, point a browser to the Web site (see the on-line Resources), scroll down
to the Linux port section, and download the latest build. Once you
have the file, change to your download directory. Next, uncompress and
then unpackage the file. For example, on the command line inside your
download directory, you might type <tt  >tar xzvf
Lpcsx-1.5.tgz</tt>.
</p><p>
This action creates a directory called Pcsx in your current location (for
example, ~/Downloads/Pcsx). Now that you have the main tool unpacked,
it's time to download and add plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f660"></a>
Getting Plugins and BIOS</h2></div></div><p>
PCSX is just a program shell. Plugins provide the functionality you
need in order to play your games. To find a good selection, go to the
Next-Gen Emulation site (see Resources) and click PlayStation. Along
the left-hand side of the PLUGINS section of links, click Linux Plugins to
find your options.
</p><p>
The plugins I selected were Pete's XGL2 Linux GPU (video), P.E.O.P.s Linux
OSS SPU (sound), CDR Mooby Linux (to use ISO files of my games instead of
the CDs) and padJoy. If you want to learn more about any of the plugins,
click the home icon next to the entry in the listing. Otherwise, click the
disk next to it in order to download the file. Either save them
directly into the Plugin subdirectory (for example, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/Plugin),
or copy them there once you have them downloaded.
</p><p>
In addition to plugins, you need a PlayStation BIOS. &ldquo;Need&rdquo; is a strong
word&mdash;PCSX comes with a rudimentary BIOS, but many recommend downloading
a real PlayStation version for the best game compatibility. It's
legally questionable to offer the BIOS content so I won't give you
a link. However, reading TheGing's Guide to PlayStation BIOS Images
(see Resources) will not only
educate you more about PlayStation BIOSes, it will give you a list of
versions to try. Enter the name of the version you want to use in a
search engine, and you'll find the files soon enough. Save the file into
the Bios subdirectory (for example, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/Bios), or move it
there once you have it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f818"></a>
Installing the &ldquo;Easy Stuff&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>
Some parts are simple to install, and some parts are
more difficult. Let's start with the easy ones, beginning with the BIOS. It
probably came in a file ending in .zip, so use either your graphical
file manager to uncompress it, or type <tt  >unzip
<i>filename</i></tt> to do it by hand
(for example, <tt  >unzip scph1001.zip</tt>). That's it. It's installed.
</p><p>
Next, we install Pete's XGL2 Linux GPU plugin. As you might guess from
the name, if you know much about sound in Linux, this plugin uses the Open
Sound System (OSS). If your system doesn't use OSS,
you need to install and set it up before your sound will work. Your
distribution already may have it in place; see the documentation for
details or search your package management system.
</p><p>
The tarball you downloaded for this plugin is in a file similar to
gpupetexgl208.tar.gz. Using your preferred method, unpack the
file. There is no configuration directory by default, so create Pcsx/cfg
(for example, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/cfg). Now, copy the files gpuPeteXGL2.cfg
and cfgPeteXGL2 into the cfg directory.
</p><p>
Getting the P.E.O.P.s Linux OSS SPU
plugin, whose filename is similar to spupeopsoss108.tar.gz, is a nearly
identical process. Unpackage it
in Plugin, and then copy spuPeopsOSS.cfg and cfgPeopsOSS into the cfg
directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0fb30"></a>
Installing CDR Mooby Linux</h2></div></div><p>
This plugin can be a bit tougher. The installation can appear to go well
and then not work, but there's a quick fix available, so don't worry. CDR
Mooby comes in a file similar to cdrmooby2.8.tgz. Unpack this tarball in
the Plugin directory. This should be all you need to do. However,
if you find later when you start PCSX, you see the error (the
program will start anyway, look on the command line):

<pre     class="programlisting">

libbz2.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0fc90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
then PCSX is looking in the wrong place for this library. Type one of the
following two commands (try locate first, and if it doesn't work, try
find):

<pre     class="programlisting">

locate libbz2.so.1.0

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0fdf0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">

find / -name libbz2.so.1.0* 2&gt; /dev/null

</pre>
</p><p>
As an example, your result might include:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/usr/lib/libbz2.so.1.0.2

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a10000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If so, notice the difference in the filenames. To make a symbolic link
so PCSX can find the library, using the example above, type (as root):

<pre     class="programlisting">

ln -s /usr/lib/libbz2.so.1.0.2 /usr/lib/libbz2.so.1.0

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a10160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Adjust what you type accordingly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a10268"></a>
Installing padJoy</h2></div></div><p>
I've saved the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; for last. You don't have to use a game controller
to use PCSX (the keyboard works too), but you may want to use
a game controller to get a genuine PlayStation experience.
</p><p>
I say this is the worst because there's more to padJoy than simply
installing the plugin. You also have to get your game controller working,
but one thing at a time. First, make sure you installed the
tools necessary to compile C programming code (such as GCC). You also
need the GNOME development tools. In addition, make sure that you have
gtk-devel&mdash;though it may be called something like gtk+-devel in your
package management system.
</p><p>
Once you have everything you need in place, compile the padJoy plugin. The
padJoy file you downloaded looks similar to padJoy082.tgz. Unpackage
it in the Plugin folder, and it creates its own subdirectory called, not
surprisingly, padJoy (for example, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/Plugin/padJoy). Enter
padJoy/src (so, for example, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/Plugin/padJoy/src), and type
<tt  >make</tt>. This command should compile the plugin. If the compilation fails,
you may be missing a dependency&mdash;hopefully, there are hints available
in the output displayed.
</p><p>
You now find the files cfgPadJoy and libpadJoy-0.8.so in the src
directory. Copy cfgPadJoy into Pcsx/cfg (so, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/cfg)
and libpadJoy-0.8.so into Pcsx/Plugin (so, ~/Downloads/Pcsx/Plugin).
</p><p>
Before you proceed, consider the game controller you intend to use with
padJoy. Do you already own one? Is it digital or analog? Does it have a
connector that can attach to your computer, such as USB? Does it require
a game port, and do you have one? (Check your sound card if you aren't
sure.) Does it have its own funky connector? If you own an Xbox controller
already (not the Xbox 360, which uses USB, but the original Xbox),
you can go to Dan Gray's site (see Resources) and
read how to use a bit of soldering to convert the controller's connector
to use USB&mdash;use these instructions at your own risk, of course. If you
own another type of controller with a proprietary connector, you can
usually purchase a third-party converter on-line.
</p><p>
I tried two different controllers with PCSX. First, I dug around
and found a joystick that connects to a computer's game port. Then I
discovered that my SoundBlaster Live! card has a game port. The first
thing I noticed is that the joystick devices didn't exist by default
on my system (look for /dev/js0 and/or /dev/input/js0, these are often
symlinked together); however, that's because my distribution uses devfs
and creates only the devices it needs at the time. All I had to do was
become the root user and type the following two commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

modprobe analog
modprobe joydev

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, when I typed <tt  >ls /dev/j* /dev/input/j*</tt>, I found that the device
/dev/input/js0 had been created, showing that the system found my
joystick. If you think that you have everything set up properly and are
just missing the device file, type <tt  >mknod /dev/input/js0 c 13
0</tt> to
create it. To test your joystick (or gamepad, or whatever you're using),
you need the joystick tools installed if they aren't already. Then, type
<tt  >jstest /dev/input/js0</tt> (adjusting the path for your driver file). You
should see output such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Joystick (Analog 3-axis 4-button joystick) has 3 axes and 4 buttons.
Driver version is 2.1.0.
Testing ... (interrupt to exit)
Axes:  0:     0  1:     0  2:-22892 Buttons:  0:off  1:off  2:off  3:off

</pre>
</p><p>
If you see this, it's a good sign. Move the joystick controller
around and press some buttons. The numbers should change and
the button positions should change. If this happens, you're
ready to move on. Press Ctrl-C to get out of the tool. If you
see an error message or nothing, the joystick isn't being
recognized. You can find a list of all supported input hardware on
SourceForge (see Resources). It is often
possible to get third-party converters that allow you to hook up game
console controllers such as PlayStation 2 gamepads. Typically, if you
can attach a gamepad through USB, you can use it.
</p><p>
If you have an original Xbox controller, you can modify it to connect to
regular USB (again, see Dan Gray's site for details); however, it will
no longer be usable with your Xbox after that. Xbox 360 controllers,
on the other hand, have USB connectors. Gentoo users can turn to
the Gentoo Wiki (see Resources) for more information on using the Xbox
360 controller. Users of other
distributions can as well, but will have to adjust their instructions
for their versions of Linux. For example, they will have to learn how
to build a kernel from scratch if their kernel's xpad driver isn't as
new as the one linked to from the Gentoo site (the driver for Fedora
Core 4's kernel 2.6.14-1.1656_FC4-i686 was far older at version .5
compared to the 1.6 of the version that supports the 360 controller,
so you likely will need to update). Those using Xbox controllers will
need the xpad driver. Because they are USB controllers, your system will
load the driver for you when you plug in the gamepad&mdash;if the pad is
properly recognized. The same jstest program works here as well.
</p><p>
Once you're (relatively) sure you have your hardware working and all of
your plugins properly installed, you can finally move on to configuring
your emulation software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a10898"></a>
Configuring PCSX and Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
PCSX is just a core program. It requires plugins to do anything,
and you already have these installed. To configure the plugins, change
to the directory you created when you unpacked the files&mdash;for example,
~/Downloads/Pcsx. From there, run the program from the command line
by typing <tt  >./pcsx</tt>.
</p><p>
A Pcsx Msg dialog appears, telling you to configure the program. Click
OK to open the PCSX Configuration dialog (Figure 1). Many of these
dialog boxes don't need you to do anything unless you have a
specialty in sound or graphics and like to tweak things, so I will skip
to those that are essential.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8851f1.large.jpg"><img src="8851f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Main PCSX Configuration Dialog
</p></div></div><p>
The main dialog box to configure is the Pad section, so click Configure
under Pad 1 (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8851f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The PAD Config Dialog
</p></div></div><p>
Next to Emulation, click the PCSX radio button. If your controller
is analog, check the analog check box as well. From here, you can
click the various buttons to change what they map to. With a joystick,
for example, you might click the up arrow in the left cluster of four
and then press the joystick handle forward. You can set some of these
buttons to map to your keyboard as well, but your keyboard options are
limited, so try to keep most on the controller. If you're into creating
macros, use the M buttons on the bottom.
</p><p>
Click OK when you are finished mapping the keys. If you have two
controllers, click the Configure button under Pad 2 and repeat the
process for the second one&mdash;make sure to change its device listing; you
can use jstest to confirm for yourself which pad is js0 and which pad
is js1. After setting up the controllers, you need to tell PCSX which
BIOS to use. Otherwise, under the BIOS section, select the BIOS that
you downloaded. To do so, find the Bios section and use the drop-down
list box to choose the BIOS in the listing.
</p><p>
Your configuration is now complete. Click OK, if all went well, and PCSX
starts (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8851f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Preparing to Play</h2></div></div><p>
PCSX can't read a PlayStation CD-ROM directly unless you use a
different plugin than the one I chose. Don't despair. I chose
the different plugin for a reason. It is, in fact, much faster for
game play if you create an image of the game CD-ROM(s) and store
them on your hard drive. You can't use most standard tools to
do this, however, because there are many little issues in the way
(see the Mega Games site if you're
interested). Instead, use <tt  >cdrdao</tt> to build an ISO file from the CD's
raw content.
For many, the command will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cdrdao read-cd --read-raw --datafile frogger.bin --device ATAPI:0,0,0 --driver generic-mmc-raw frogger.toc

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2e094e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where frogger.bin is the data file to create (the CD you will select
when it comes time to play), and frogger.toc is the table of contents
file to create. Both of these files are named after the game,
so I easily can tell which one I want to choose. The ATAPI:0,0,0 entry
will work for most CD-ROM drives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2e095e8"></a>
Finally, Playing a Game</h2></div></div><p>
Yes, it's been a long haul, but you finally can attempt to play a
game. I'll warn you right now that not all games will work.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Frogger</em></span>
worked immediately, but I'm still fussing with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Final Fantasy
VII</em></span>, which
is, of course, a more complex game.
</p><p>
Start PCSX just as you did earlier: enter the Pcsx directory and type
<tt  >./pcsx</tt>. This time, only the PCSX dialog appears. If you need to,
use the Configuration menu to adjust your settings. When you're ready
to play, select File--&gt;Run CD and then navigate to where you stored
your .bin and .toc files. Select the .bin file for the game, and click OK
(Figure 4). It might take a bit of practice to figure out your control
setup, but it gets easier.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8851f4.large.jpg"><img src="8851f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Frogger</em></span> for the Original PlayStation Running in PCSX
</p></div></div><p>
Make sure you're not running something that hogs processor time or RAM
in the background. You can watch for this by opening a terminal window
and typing <tt  >top</tt> to open the process monitor. You may find that trying
to make the game window larger doesn't work and, in fact, even crashes
your machine. If you want to run a game through the specified BIOS,
choose File--&gt;Run CD Through BIOS. This action might convince some
touchy games to play.
