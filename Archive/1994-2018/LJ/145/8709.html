Here are ten tips that will help you avoid some of the most common
pitfalls when coding Web applications in PHP.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There is little doubt that PHP is one of the easiest languages to use to
start generating dynamic Web content. PHP, in combination with Linux,
Apache and MySQL is so popular, it has spawned the expression LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). Many pages go on-line without any need for
their authors to set up or program anything themselves. They simply find
some pre-cooked piece of code with a search engine, paste it as is into
an HTML template, upload everything to their Web server, and they are done.
</p><p>
Or so they believe. Even previous programming experience may not help
much, because coding for a desktop or for the Web are two very different
paradigms. Therefore, pretty often, when people cut and paste PHP code,
nothing happens (nothing good, at least). The pages load
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> slowly
or worse, the programmer's choice of PHP code opens a new security hole.
</p><p>
The tips below are written especially for users who already know the basics
of programming, but who have never touched PHP before. They might be roughly
divided in three categories: how to start correctly, how not to hurt
yourself and, finally, how to make their code more efficient. Due
to space constraints and the fact that there already is plenty of good
on-line and paper documentation for PHP, most tips explain only what to
look for and why.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a94a8"></a>
1. Check Whether Everything Was Installed and Configured
Correctly</h2></div></div><p>
One common source of confusion for PHP beginners is to upload their
first Web page on some server and see only the PHP/HTML
source code in the browser instead of the expected content. This happens because the Web
server doesn't recognize the file as something that should be passed to
the PHP interpreter. The reason for this is that the system administrator forgot
to associate the PHP file with the PHP interpreter. You can do this in
the Apache configuration file or in a local .htaccess file. Here is a
sample configuration line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php

</pre>
</p><p>
As a matter of fact, it is possible to know how things stand simply by
uploading this really short page to your Web space:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;PHP Configuration Check&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;? php phpinfo() ?&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
With any luck, the result will be similar to what is shown in Figure
1. The phpinfo() function prints out how PHP was compiled and the value
of all configuration variables. This function gives you a lot of useful
information. Its output probably will be the very first thing you'll
be asked for whenever you seek support on an on-line PHP forum.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8709f1.large.jpg"><img src="8709f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a98c8"></a>
2. Let PHP and the Script Tell You about Your Errors</h2></div></div><p>
In order to speed up debugging, you can tell both PHP and
the Apache Web server which errors must be reported and when. The
error_reporting variable in the php.ini configuration file can be seen as
a series of (bit) flags. Each of them can be set individually to detect
(or not) a specific category of errors. This instruction, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

error_reporting = E_ALL

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a9a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
sends anything from simple warnings to serious bugs to the browser,
but only if the other variable display_errors is turned on. General
PHP settings in the php.ini file can be overridden at the Web server
level. When using Apache, the instruction equivalent to the one above
would be (in httpd.conf):

<pre     class="programlisting">

php_flag  display_errors      on
php_value error_reporting	2047

</pre>
</p><p>
Should you have no access to the PHP/Web server configuration, as
often happens, the same result can be accomplished by adding this command
to your scripts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

error_reporting(E_ALL);

</pre>
</p><p>
Speaking of Web servers, remember also to check their error logs to know
exactly which line of code caused a script to crash.
</p><p>
If a script still fails after all these tricks have ceased to find any
error, almost surely the bug is in the script logic itself. Somewhere,
some variable is assigned a value that you thought not possible for
it, and this confuses the rest of the code. This also applies when the
variable is actually some SQL statement built on the fly and passed
to a database server.
</p><p>
The solution is to display that variable on your browser. You can do
this easily with the print() instruction normally used to send HTML
code to the browser. The die() statement does the same thing as print(),
but it also stops the script immediately afterward.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a9d40"></a>
3. Headers before Anything Else!</h2></div></div><p>
You can generate and transmit any kind of HTTP header before even starting
to build the actual Web page. However, you must remember that
header() has to be called before any HTML code or PHP output, including
blank or empty lines! Code like this, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php /* any PHP command(s) here */ ?&gt;

&lt;?php header("Content-type: image/png"); ?&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a9ea0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will not work. The mere presence of the empty line between the two
encoded PHP statements will cause PHP to transmit standard HTTP headers,
which almost always will not be what you wanted (otherwise you would not
have used that function). Note that the blank line may even
be...in another file. That is, the same thing will happen if you load PHP
code from some external file that doesn't end exactly with the closing
?&gt; PHP tag.
</p><p>
This is a frequent cause of headaches for programmers who build sites that
use cookies. The only way to make cookies work is to handle them before
your PHP program sends header information. If you don't realize that a
simple blank line sends header information, you can stare at your code
for hours wondering why you are having problems with cookies. After all,
you do handle cookies before you deliberately send the header. What you
don't necessarily notice is that there's a blank line in your program
(or included file) that is sending headers without your knowledge,
which is why your cookies don't work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aa000"></a>
4. Always Check User Data (and Beware of E-mail Addresses)</h2></div></div><p>
You should always validate data that your pages receive from the
Web. JavaScript routines that validate form input on the user browser
are useless security-wise. Nothing prevents a cracker from
sending malicious data directly to your code. Imagine a PHP shopping cart
that can show all the items below the $HIGHEST_PRICE decided by the
user. If, without previous checks, you merrily performed a database
query with a $HIGHEST_PRICE whose value is something like &ldquo;delete *
from my_database;&rdquo;, don't complain when your on-line store looks empty!
</p><p>
You can validate data using a combination of three techniques. The first
is to analyze the data with regular expressions that explicitly define
only the formats that are allowed; a phone number or year of birth,
for example, can contain only digits, so pass it through the function
is_digit().
</p><p>
The second is to use other functions like EscapeShellCmd(),
which can block &ldquo;data&rdquo; from executing unwanted system commands, or
mysql_escape_string() on variables that must be inserted into an SQL
statement.
</p><p>
The last type of validation strictly depends on the actual meaning
of a variable and the context in which it is used. Only you can help
yourself here. For example, 5555555 is made only of digits, but (in North
America) it is not a valid phone number. It should be allowed only if
the user declared to be from another country. Similarly, although 18 is
a perfectly valid $AGE, a script offering discounts to senior citizens
should refuse it, right?
</p><p>
E-mail addresses are particularly troublesome from
this point of view. There are several functions that
validate their syntactical correctness, like the one at
<a href="http://www.zend.com/tips/tips.php?id=224&amp;single=1" target="_self">www.zend.com/tips/tips.php?id=224&amp;single=1</a>. They do nothing, however,
to guarantee that an address does belong to the person who sent it,
or that it exists at all, such as Luke.Skywalker@whitehouse.gov. Well,
it's probably a safe assumption that there is no Luke.Skywalker in the
White House, anyway. Always ask users to reply to a confirmation message
or open a socket to their mail server to check whether they exist.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aa2c0"></a>
5. Properly Manage Quotes and Escapes</h2></div></div><p>
What will appear in your browser if you load this very simple PHP code?

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;? php
$HOME = 'a sweet place';
print "1: $HOME&lt;br&gt;"; // double quotes
print '2: $HOME&lt;br&gt;'; // single quotes
?&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aa420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The answer is these two lines of text:

<pre     class="programlisting">

1: a sweet place
2: $HOME

</pre>
</p><p>
Double quotes make PHP replace any variable inside them with its current
value. The content of single quotes is treated like one monolithic,
opaque block that can be copied or printed only, not modified. The
same applies when you use quotes to build the keys of an associative
array. $my_array['$HOME'] and $my_array[&ldquo;$HOME&rdquo;] will be different
elements. That's it. Still, it is very easy to forget this distinction
and use one when you meant the other, or no quote at all. Therefore, when
something doesn't have the value you expected, check the quotes first.
</p><p>
Because user data cannot be trusted, PHP can be set up to
escape with slashes automatically with all the $_POST sent by an HTML form to the
script. Actually, even internal data could contain slashes, to escape
special characters, which must be removed before processing them. The
solution is to use the stripslashes function, as in this example
straight from the on-line PHP manual:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
$str = "Is your name O\'reilly?";
// Outputs: Is your name O'reilly?
echo stripslashes($str);
?&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aa688"></a>
6. Let the Database Do the Work Instead of Your Script</h2></div></div><p>
As stated above, PHP is used together with MySQL so often that the
LAMP acronym is one of the most well-known combinations in Web design. Consequently, one of the best ways to
write faster PHP scripts is to learn MySQL well enough that it works as
much as possible instead of PHP. These two snippets of code illustrate
the concept:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php //find all the books that Asimov wrote after 1980
$sql = "select YEAR, BOOK from MY_BOOKSHELF where AUTHOR LIKE 'Asimov' ; ";
  if ($sql_res = mysql_query("$sql")) {
    while ($r  = mysql_fetch_array($sql_res)) {
      if ($r[YEAR] &gt; 1980) {// print the book title ;}
   }
?&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aa7e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And,

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php //find with MySql all the books that Asimov wrote after 1980
$sql = "select BOOK from MY_BOOKSHELF where AUTHOR LIKE 'Asimov'  AND YEAR &gt; 1980;";
  if ($sql_res = mysql_query("$sql")) {
    while ($r = mysql_fetch_array($sql_res)) {
      // just print all the returned titles ;
}
?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The second version will run much faster than the first, because database
engines are designed to select as quickly as possible all and only
the data matching any combination of criteria. They'll always be much
faster than PHP is in this kind of task. Therefore, make sure that as much
as possible of your selection logic is inside the SQL query, not in the
PHP code that builds and uses it. Of course, this whole tip applies as
is to any other database engine you would use with PHP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aa9a0"></a>
7. Write Portable File Management Code</h2></div></div><p>
Line endings in text files are encoded differently on each family of
operating systems. Binary files, such as images or compressed archives, are
much worse, in the sense that even one corrupted character can make the
whole file useless. Practically speaking, this means it is up to
you to write code that will manage file contents in the same way on any
platform you might use. This remains true even if you are sure that you
and your Web server will always and only run GNU/Linux. Otherwise, you
could find no error in your image or text processing code until you use
it to upload a file from the Windows or Apple computer of a friend!
</p><p>
As far as PHP is concerned, the solution is to make proper use of the
t (text mode translation) and b (binary) flags of the fopen() system
call. The gory details are at <a href="http://www.php.net/function.fopen" target="_self">www.php.net/function.fopen</a>. Note that
the page explicitly suggests: &ldquo;for portability, it is also strongly
recommended that you re-write code that uses or relies upon the t
mode.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aab58"></a>
8. Know String Processing Functions</h2></div></div><p>
Web pages still are mostly made of text, and the same is true for many
databases. This is why optimizing text analysis and processing is one of
the easiest ways to make all of your scripts run faster. Regular expressions
are made to order for such jobs, but they look like hieroglyphics and may
not even always be the optimal solution. PHP, although not going to the same
extremes (uh, we mean power and flexibility of Perl), has more than one
function working just like regular expressions, only much quicker. We
refer to str_replace(), strcmp(), strtolower(), strtoupper(), strtr(),
substr(), trim(), ucfirst() and several others. Take some time to study
them in the manual, it will be well worth it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25aac60"></a>
9. Keep Layout and Programming Separate</h2></div></div><p>
A sure way to make the source of any Web site unreadable and
difficult to update is to interlace large chunks of PHP and HTML
code, even if each piece of PHP is used only once in the page, as in
this example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

myfile.php&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of HTML code for static header, logo, menus...&gt;
&lt;?php lots of PHP code generating a list of the latest news ?&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of HTML code for the central part of the page...&gt;
&lt;?php lots of PHP code creating a per-user list of the
   most popular pages ?&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of HTML code for the user feedback form...&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Instead of making this error, encapsulate every piece of PHP code in
one or more functions, then put them all in one separate file (without
any HTML code), which will be loaded with the include_once command. The
result will be much cleaner and easier to maintain:

<pre     class="programlisting">

myfile.php&gt;
&lt;?php include_once ("common_code.php"); ?&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of HTML code for the static page header, logo,
menus...&gt;
&lt;?php show_latest_news (); /* only one function call */ ?&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of HTML code for the central part of the page...&gt;
&lt;?php show_most_popular_pages (); /* only one function call */ ?&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of HTML code for the user feedback form...&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Anther big advantage of this approach is that, by simply including
common_code.php as shown above, any page of your Web site will be able
to use those same functions. Even more important, should any function be
modified, the new version would be available immediately in all the pages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a1758"></a>
10. Check the Results of Function and System Calls</h2></div></div><p>
Last but not least, <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> PHP functions must return acceptable data to the
code that called them. The tricky part of this apparently superfluous
statement is the fact that the meaning of acceptable depends on the
whole script, and it may be different at any time. Here is a very dumb, but
effective example of what we mean:

<pre     class="programlisting">

function subtraction($A, $B) {
	$diff = $A - $B;
  	return($diff);
}
   $C = 1/subtraction(3, 3);      // ERROR! Division by Zero!
   $D = 1/(1 - subtraction(3,3);

</pre>
</p><p>
Although calculating $C will make the script crash, calculating (with the
same operands), $D will not. The point is that before doing anything
with a variable, you should check that it has an acceptable value. In
the example above, this would mean assigning the subtraction result to
an auxiliary variable and proceeding with the division only if it is
non-null.
</p><p>
It is even more important to check return values from system calls, that
is, the built-in functions provided to allow interaction with external
processes and files. Should you forget to check a return value, data
could be thrown away without anyone noticing, as in this example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
$HANDLE = fopen("newuser.txt","w")); // open a file
fwrite($HANDLE, "New User Data");    // write to it
?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If fopen fails (because, for example, the disc is full or you had no
permission to write) the New User Data is lost for good. Before
writing, check that $HANDLE is not null:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
if (!$HANDLE = fopen("newuser.txt","w")) { die "File access failed: newuser.txt"; }
fwrite($HANDLE, "New User Data");
?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Happy PHP coding!
