SoftMaker Office</h2></div></div><p>
Founded in 1987, the Germany-based software vendor SoftMaker has spent the
modern PC era developing and improving its own office program, SoftMaker
Office. SoftMaker Office 2016 for Linux is SoftMaker's latest release
of the office suite, which consists of the word processor TextMaker, the
spreadsheet program PlanMaker and the presentation program SoftMaker
Presentations. SoftMaker's value proposition vs. other office suites
includes a compact footprint, stability, availability in Standard and
Professional versions, add-ons for the Thunderbird e-mail client, as well
as compatibility with (and a five-fold speed advantage over) Microsoft
Office. The new SoftMaker Office 2016 boasts more than 400 new features, such as
optimized software architecture accelerated by the use of OpenGL for
screen display and multiple CPU cores for graphic rendering, improved
compatibility features with MS-Office, built-in version management for
documents, support for 9,000 label formats, improved pivot-table
functionality, smart guides for alignment of objects in presentations and
more. The Professional edition adds four high-quality dictionaries by
Berlitz for easy translation between English, Spanish, Italian, German and
French. All modern Linux distributions are supported.

Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak and Paul Buhler's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Data Fundamentals</em></span> (Prentice-Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
Because Big Data will only get bigger, the case for reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Data
Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers &amp; Techniques</em></span> will only get stronger.
Co-authored by best-selling IT author Thomas Erl and collaborators Wajid Khattak
and Paul Buhler, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Data Fundamentals</em></span> is a pragmatic, no-nonsense
introduction to Big Data for business and technology professionals. The
authors clearly explain key Big Data concepts, theory and terminology, as
well as fundamental technologies and techniques. All coverage is supported
with case-study examples and numerous simple diagrams. The authors
commence by explaining how Big Data can move an organization forward by
solving a wide range of previously intractable business problems. Next,
they demystify key analysis techniques and technologies and show how a Big
Data solution environment can be built and integrated to offer competitive
advantages. Other key topics include differences between Big Data and
previous forms of data analysis and science, business motivations and
drivers behind Big Data adoption and recognizing the five &ldquo;V&rdquo;
characteristics of datasets in Big Data environments: volume, velocity,
variety, veracity and value.

Ziften ZFlow</h2></div></div><p>
As enterprises have migrated to the cloud for economic and operational
purposes, traditional network visibility has been lost due to a lack of
access at the infrastructure layer. To help organizations avoid operating
in the dark in the penguin zone, security specialist Ziften has released a
new version of its flagship Ziften ZFlow for the Linux operating system.
Ziften ZFlow delivers greater network visibility by providing full
visibility, contextual intelligence, user behavioral analysis and
integration into previously deployed security tools. This new integration
with Linux provides previously non-existent visibility into the public
cloud infrastructure and enables Ziften's new Cloud Visibility
Initiative. The initiative helps secure cloud operations with the
visibility that security professionals need to identify and
respond to potential threats and attacks quickly. Ziften adds that ZFlow is
lightweight, meets IPFIX standards and enables better east-west
visibility to identify lateral movement of an attack within the data
center.

Varnish Software's Zipnish</h2></div></div><p>
Gaining insights into how quickly services are running or whether they are
adding latency is a difficult task in distributed architectures such as
microservices. To simplify this task, Varnish Software launched Zipnish, a
new open-source, architecture-agnostic tool that tracks performance and
helps resolve latency issues in microservices architectures. Zipnish uses
the Varnish logging API from Varnish Cache 4.0 to monitor transactions and
uses Python and the event library Twisted to transport the data. MySQL is
used as the database for storage. The presentation back end is done in Python,
whereas a slightly modified version of Zipkin is used as front end.

Red Hat CloudForms</h2></div></div><p>
To meet customer demands in today's hybrid, heterogeneous world, Red
Hat established an alliance with Microsoft to release Red Hat CloudForms
4, the latest version of the company's open-platform hybrid cloud
management solution that now features Microsoft Azure support. Red Hat
declares that Red Hat CloudForms 4 goes beyond self-service, offering a
consistent experience and comprehensive lifecycle management across
platforms, covering virtualization, private cloud, public cloud and
containers. In addition to enabling Azure customers to manage those
workloads and resources within CloudForms, release 4 adds management for
container architectures and improved self-service dashboards and charts to
better analyze the relationships between different cloud platforms and
container hosts. Other platforms besides Azure into which Red Hat
CloudForms 4 provides operational insight include Amazon Web Services,
Hyper-V, OpenShift by Red Hat, OpenStack, Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization and VMware.

Imagination Technologies' Creator Ci40</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Where do I start?&rdquo; is a common question for those of us exploring
the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded computing markets. Imagination
Technologies answers that question in the form of a product, namely the
firm's new Creator Ci40 IoT kit, which helps one make sense of the
oh-so-many boards and accessories, hardware and software interfaces,
connectivity standards and APIs in IoT. The Creator Ci40 includes not only
the hardware building blocks needed to prototype a wireless IoT
system from scratch quickly, but also the open-source software frameworks, the
network stacks and the cloud connectivity capabilities required to
connect and authenticate devices to the cloud securely. The included Ci40
microcomputer has been specifically designed for smart home, IoT and other
connected devices (drones, robots and so on) and features the hardware
requirements (802.11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi, an Ethernet port, SD and USB storage)
for use as a high-speed wireless router. The board runs Linux (Debian,
OpenWrt) and is part of Google's golden reference program for its
Brillo OS for IoT. Rounding out the kit are add-ons from Mikroelectronica:
two battery-powered Clicker board development kits and three Click boards
for measuring temperature, detecting motion and controlling a relay.

Opera Max</h2></div></div><p>
Cheapo data hogs (like you) with limited data plans can stretch their
budgets and double their streaming of video&mdash;and now music&mdash;using Opera
Max, Opera ASA's upgraded data-management and data-saving app for Android.
The latest release adds streaming audio optimization to the existing video
optimization functionality. Opera notes that nine hours of streaming music or
on-line radio require 1GB of throughput, which easily can burn through a
data plan when using mobile networks. Complementing Opera Max's
existing ability to optimize streaming-video services like YouTube and
Netflix comes new functionality that optimizes streaming music apps, such
as YouTube Music, Pandora, Slacker Radio, Gaana and Saavn, with others on
the way. Opera's optimization technique for audio involves applying
technology from Rocket Optimizer for converting MP3 and MP4 audio streams
to the more efficient AAC+ codec, which delivers high audio quality over a
low bitrate connection to any compatible device.

(Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
IT author Sander van Vugt says that his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning the Linux Command
Line</em></span>, now in it second edition, is for everyone who uses Linux&mdash;no

Linux&rdquo;. Other learning objectives include finding the right command
for the task at hand, working with text editors and intelligent filters,
shell programming, configuring access to hardware devices and more.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning the Linux Command Line</em></span> is checked against all of the most
important Linux distributions and follows a task-oriented approach
that is distribution-agnostic. This new second edition of the book covers
features of the very latest versions of the Linux operating system,
including the new Btrfs filesystem, the systemd boot procedure and
firewall management with firewalld.
