Looking to sharpen your professional skills? Here's Reuven's latest roundup of useful
books to improve your knowledge and career.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc1580.0x10b93b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the computer industry, you don't have a choice&mdash;you must constantly
keep learning new things, just to stay in place. I spend many hours
each week reading blogs, watching conference videos and just
exploring technologies on my own, because if I don't do that, 
I'm going to find myself unable to use the latest technologies to help
my clients.
</p><p>
But of course, there is at least one other tried-and-true way to learn:
books. Sure, books (or their electronic equivalents) have been
eulogized numerous times during the last few years. But,
programming-related books continue to be published, some by well known
publishers and others by independent programmers.
</p><p>
Every so often, I take time in this column to review the latest crop
of books that have helped make me more effective in my work. As
always, the descriptions and reviews of these books (and other media)
are not only subjective in terms of the content, but also in terms of
the timing; it's quite possible that I only recently discovered a book
that came out a while ago. I try to mention books here that you might
find interesting or useful in your work, much as I've found them to be
interesting and useful in my own work.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most interesting trend we're now seeing in the book
market, and especially when it comes to computer books, is the number
of self-published ebooks being produced. (Heck, I've written two of
them myself: one on Python and another on regular expressions.) These
books rely on word of mouth, social media and marketing by the
developers/authors themselves.
</p><p>
There's no doubt that traditional publishers continue to have great
reach and are producing more books (and well edited books, at that)
than independent developers ever can hope to match. But the number of
self-published ebooks continues to grow, as well as those sold via
sites like <a href="https://leanpub.com" target="_self">https://leanpub.com</a>. It will be interesting to see what happens
in the coming years as book-creation systems, such as GitBook and
Softcover, make it even easier to create and sell your own books.
</p><p>
So, what have I been reading, and what would I suggest you read as
well?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc1580.0x10b97d0"></a>
Programming Books</h2></div></div><p>
I continue to enjoy reading programming books, partly because there's
always something new to learn, partly because different authors offer
different perspectives, and partly because I often can pick up
insights and tricks that I can incorporate into my courses. I continue
to use Ruby on Rails for Web development, so I always am happy to
look at Ruby-related books.
</p><p>
One of my most favorite Ruby books is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Metaprogramming Ruby</em></span> by Paolo
Perotta and published by the Pragmatic Bookshelf. The book has 
been updated to include Ruby 2, and although Ruby's underlying object system
hasn't changed in many years, every version of Ruby is a bit
different&mdash;and knowing how to take advantage of those differences
can make a huge difference in your productivity. If you are using
Ruby in your work, you really should read this book.
</p><p>
Teaching children to program always has been a passion of mine, so
I'm always interested in books and software that try to teach
kids how to program. Several years ago, I mentioned the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python
for Kids</em></span>, and it shouldn't be much of a surprise to discover
that there's now a book for kids to get into Ruby, called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ruby
Wizardry</em></span>. I think I should distinguish between two different
goals here though. If you really want your children to learn Ruby, 
this book is an entertaining way to do so, with numerous examples and
a storyline I'd like to think kids would enjoy.
But, if you're trying to teach children to program and are agnostic on
the language used, I'm not sure if Ruby is the right way to go.
(See below for my recommendation of an on-line system that seems to be
doing that right.) My limited experience with trying to teach Ruby, or
even Python, to children has been fairly lackluster&mdash;not because the
materials are bad, but because kids are less interested in the
language than in what they can do with the language.
</p><p>
I have been using a great deal of Python in recent years and 
also have been teaching a huge number of Python classes around the
world. I'm always looking for ways to explain advanced aspects of
Python better; thus, Obi Ike-Nwosu's self-published <span   class="emphasis"><em>Intermediate
Python</em></span> ebook caught my attention. I found that many aspects of this
book put ideas into nice context and into a focus that otherwise might
have been lost. If you have been working with Python for more than a
few months and want to deepen your knowledge and understanding on a
few topics, this book seems like a good place to go.
</p><p>
Finally, I continue to work a great deal with PostgreSQL, a database
whose features and community continue to grow in size and quality with
every passing year. Hans-Jurgen Schonig, a very accomplished
PostgreSQL consultant and contributor, has written <span   class="emphasis"><em>Troubleshooting
PostgreSQL</em></span> (published by Packt), a book that is something like a
first-aid kit for PostgreSQL developers and DBAs. He touches on all
of the sensitive topics, including indexing, transactions, locking,
monitoring, replication and backups. Even if you have been using
PostgreSQL for some time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Troubleshooting PostgreSQL</em></span> is an excellent
investment, one that will more than pay for itself in time saved and
hair (not) pulled.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc1580.0x10b9cf8"></a>
Data Science</h2></div></div><p>
It was probably somewhat inevitable as someone who has worked with
databases, uses Python and has an interest in statistics that I would
slowly but surely slide into data science. I've thus been spending
time during the last year, and especially the last few months, learning
more and more about this fascinating subject&mdash;both so I can
help my clients solve data-science problems and so I can
offer training in the use of Python for data science. There has been
an explosion of books about data science in the past few years, and
I've been working my way through no small number of them.
</p><p>
Two high-quality books about data science are <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doing Data Science</em></span> by
Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt, published by O'Reilly, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Data Science from
Scratch</em></span> by Joel Grus, also 
published by O'Reilly. Grus uses Python and
pushes hard in the use of functional programming techniques in Python,
along with the standard data-science stack available to Python
developers, such as matplotlib and pandas. But, he also provides no
small amount of insights into how&mdash;and, just as important, when
and why&mdash;we should use such techniques as linear regression
vs. multiple regression vs. k-nearest neighbors. The book contains a
very large number of code examples, and because it's written in
Python, it's likely to use paradigms with which Python developers 
already are familiar, such as iteration and comprehensions. The former
book, which I have recommended in earlier book-review columns, gives a
serious introduction to the how and why, not only including code, but
also the mathematical ideas behind that code.
</p><p>
Another book on this topic, currently in early release from O'Reilly, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python
Data Science Handbook</em></span> written by Jake VanderPlas. If <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doing Data
Science</em></span> takes a mathematical approach, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Data Science from
Scratch</em></span> takes a functional-programming approach, then this book takes
what I'd call a practical approach&mdash;introducing the elements of
Python that a budding data scientist most needs to understand, keeping
the programming and mathematics at a reasonable level for people who
are unfamiliar with either or both. I'm still reading through this
early-release edition, but as an introduction to learning science with
a relatively easy learning curve, it may soon become my
most-recommended book for people new to the subject.
</p><p>
Ivan Idris has written two books for Packt Press that are good overall
introductions to data-science tools in Python, namely <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Data
Analysis</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Data Analysis Cookbook</em></span>. The former introduces
the topics and (as with the book by Grus, mentioned previously)
provides a tutorial into areas like visualization, time series
and machine learning. The cookbook is a complementary volume; instead
of teaching based on subjects, it takes a problem-solution
approach. I'd suggest that reading the tutorial first is a good idea;
you then can read through the cookbook's table of contents and/or
index to find the specific issues on which you need to work.
</p><p>
If you're interested in data science, but would rather hear about the
insights and perspective than the mathematics, read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dataclysm: Who We
Are (When We Think No One Is Looking)</em></span> by Christian Rudder, one of the
founders of OKCupid. In this book, Rudder finds fascinating correlations
that provide insights into human behavior&mdash;thanks to the huge number
of data points collected by the dating site he runs.
</p><p>
I would be remiss if I were to ignore the amazing e-mail list produced
by Analytics Vidhya, a name that doesn't quite roll off of the tongue
of English-speaking Americans, but which offers daily insights for
anyone interested in the technology, algorithms and practice of data
science: <a href="http://analyticsvidhya.com" target="_self">analyticsvidhya.com</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc1580.0x10ba2d0"></a>
Other Subjects</h2></div></div><p>
I might be a software developer, but I also run a small company, so 
I'm always looking for books that can help me run my company
even better or find new business opportunities.
</p><p>
One book, published just before I wrote this column, comes from a
group of consultants with a Slack channel. They jointly wrote and
published <span   class="emphasis"><em>The independent consulting manual</em></span>, an ebook meant for
people who are consulting, or want to consult, but aren't sure where
to start, how to find clients, how to price themselves or how to
create products. The book (at <a href="http://independentconsultingmanual.com" target="_self">independentconsultingmanual.com</a>)
has many famous contributors, all of whom have made the leap to
running their own businesses, and the lessons they've learned,
and contributed, make for extremely worthwhile reading.
</p><p>
One of the authors of the above ebook, and a co-panelist of mine on the
Freelancers Show podcast, is Philip Morgan. Morgan has done a lot to
encourage consultants to position themselves&mdash;that is, to define a
specific niche in which they can be the best-known experts. His book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Positioning Manual for Technical Firms</em></span> (available at
<a href="http://ThePositioningManual.com" target="_self">ThePositioningManual.com</a>) is full of excellent advice,
including many reminders that although advertising yourself in a specific
niche might seem like a way to lose money, it's actually the ticket to
making more and to becoming a more successful consultant.
</p><p>
Of course, I read about other subjects too. If, like me, you're interested
in the intersection of history, science and food, you should
read the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Consider the Fork</em></span> by Bee Wilson, which describes
the evolution (and diversity) of kitchen utensils and gadgets. Wonder
why China and America have different-shaped spoons or how forks and
the shape of our teeth are related? This book describes it all. I was
introduced to this book by the great &ldquo;Gastropod&rdquo; podcast, which talks
about these subjects in great depth.
</p><p>
Another great book that I read this year is <span   class="emphasis"><em>What If</em></span> by Randall
Munroe, the author of XKCD. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>What If</em></span>, Munroe asks crazy
hypothetical questions, but then proceeds to answer them with the
perfect balance of science and humor. I read the first part of this
book while eating at a restaurant, and I feel bad for the other
patrons who had to endure me laughing quite loudly at the absurdities
in this book, mixed together with (of course) great illustrations and
explanations.
</p><p>
Finally, my children are getting older, so I have less and less
of a chance to read to them. However, I did manage to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Terrible Two</em></span> by Mac Barnett and Jory John, a beautiful and funny
story about pranks (or &ldquo;hacks&rdquo;, as we called them during my undergrad
days at MIT), friendship and the all-important goal of making a
school principal look foolish in front of the students.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc1580.0x10ba958"></a>
Podcasts and Other Resources</h2></div></div><p>
I continue to listen to a very large number of podcasts each week,
partly because I enjoy them so much and partly because they're so
convenient for someone like me, who often commutes by bus or train to
clients' offices.
</p><p>
Two new Python-related podcasts have emerged in the last year: &ldquo;Talk
Python to Me&rdquo; and &ldquo;Podcast.__init__&rdquo; are both interesting, with great
interviews and many insights into technologies that I either use every
day or should start to learn.
</p><p>
Other podcasts that I enjoy tend to be on the subjects of politics and
economics&mdash;from Slate's &ldquo;Political Gabfest&rdquo; and &ldquo;Slate
Money&rdquo; to NPR's
&ldquo;Planet Money&rdquo; to &ldquo;Podcast for America&rdquo;, an irreverent look at the US
political race.
But there are many other great podcasts to try, such as the
BBC's &ldquo;More or Less&rdquo; about statistics, &ldquo;Functional Geekery&rdquo; about
functional programming, &ldquo;Freelancer Transformation&rdquo; about how to
become a successful consultant and &ldquo;Startup&rdquo;, which is all about what it's
like to run a venture-based startup company.
</p><p>
I mentioned earlier my interest in helping children learn to code, and
I've discovered (thanks to my ten-year-old son) a terrific site that
does just that: Code Monkey (at <a href="http://PlayCodeMonkey.com" target="_self">PlayCodeMonkey.com</a>) uses
CoffeeScript of all things to teach programming to children. However,
it does so using inventive and creative graphics, high-quality error
messages and a staged approach that does a very good job of
introducing programming to kids aged 8&ndash;12. In my son's
case, his school paid for entry into all of the levels, but I would
gladly have paid the $30 that Code Monkey charges to do all of the levels it
offers, as well as build some of my own. It's rare for me to say
that I have seen an educational technology that lives up to its hype,
but this is definitely one of those times.
</p><p>
Finally, let me mention a site that I run called Daily Tech Video
(<a href="http://DailyTechVideo.com" target="_self">DailyTechVideo.com</a>), which offers a new, high-quality
conference video every day. If you're interested in open-source
technologies, programming languages, databases and even some computer
history, I invite you to take a look at my site and even to suggest
high-quality conference talks I might have missed. You also
can follow the site's update on Twitter at @DailyTechVideo.
