<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #262, February 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>OOM killer</b></span> is a tough nut to crack. How can a system recover when it's violently
thrashing and out of RAM? Once upon a time, you'd just have to reboot. And today, that
still might be necessary, but less so, because the OOM killer attempts to identify and
stop the process that seems to be causing the hangup. The problem is, it may not choose
the right process every time. Another problem is that the whole thing is super tough and
complex.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michal Hocko</b></span> recently tried to peel off a sliver to work
on, taking the lead from <span   class="bold"><b>Mel
Gorman</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Oleg Nesterov</b></span>. Apparently, the current OOM killer would allocate an extra
batch of memory just for the process it wanted to kill to actually give it enough breathing room
to terminate properly. But under some circumstances, the process would accept
the extra memory and still hang the system. Then with no more memory to dole out, the
OOM killed couldn't try again, and it was time to hit the reset button.
</p><p>
Michal posted a patch to create a new kernel thread that would reclaim that extra memory
if it went unused. Then the OOM killer could try the same thing on a different process
and hopefully have a different result. And although there were no major objections to
Michal's patch itself, a variety of folks objected to the idea of making any kind of
incremental improvement to the OOM killer, when the Big Problem had not yet been solved.
</p><p>
The Big Problem, as described by <span   class="bold"><b>Johannes Weiner</b></span>, was how to resolve memory deadlocks in
general. Only by solving that problem could the OOM killer successfully kill the
processes it needed to, even to the point of killing all user processes, just to keep the
kernel up.
</p><p>
But, Michal made a point of keeping the discussion clamped down to a consideration of only
the small fixes he'd proposed. He acknowledged that he had no solution for the Big
Problem, and he pointed out that no one else seemed to have a viable solution for the Big
Problem either. And until something viable came up, Michal saw no point in stalling OOM
killer development. If something could be done to improve it, he felt, then it should be
done.
</p><p>
By and large everyone went along with this, but still, it's clear there's a lot of
pressure on the OOM killer system to come up with some kind of new idea or at least to
create a policy-based system that puts control of the choices of processes to kill into
the hands of system administrators rather than the kernel algorithms themselves.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> had some advice for anyone writing kernel code that needs to lock
resources: it's probably better to use existing locking implementations rather than
rolling your own&mdash;at least, until you know what you're doing. As he put it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
People need to realize that locking is harder than they think, and not cook up their own
lock primitives using things like trylock without really thinking about it a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span>.
</p><p>
Basically, <tt  >trylock()</tt> on its own should never be used in a loop. The main use for
trylock should be one of:
</p><p>
1) Thing that you can just not do at all if you can't get the lock.
</p><p>
2) Avoiding ABBA deadlocks: if you have an A-&gt;B locking order, but you already hold B,
instead of &ldquo;drop B, then take A and B in the right order&rdquo;, you may decide first
to <tt  >trylock(A)</tt>, and if that fails, you then fall back on the
&ldquo;drop and relock in the right
order&rdquo;.
</p><p>
But if what you want to create is a &ldquo;get lock using trylock&rdquo;, you need to be very aware
of the cache coherency traffic issue at least.
</p><p>
It is possible that we should think about trying to introduce a new primitive for that
<tt  >loop_try_lock()</tt> thing. But it's probably not common enough to be
worth it&mdash;we've had
this issue before, but I think it's a &ldquo;once every couple of years&rdquo; kind of thing rather
than anything that we need to worry about.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;locking is hard&rdquo; issue is very real, though. We've traditionally had a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of code
that tried to do its own locking, and not getting the memory ordering right, etc. Things
that happen to work on x86 but don't on other architectures, etc.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Quick Games</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #262, February 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The biggest problem I have with gaming is that it takes far too long to
get &ldquo;into&rdquo; games. I'm generally very busy, and my gaming time usually
lasts as long as it takes for the dentist to call me in from the waiting
room (or possibly how long it takes me to use the bathroom, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>eiw</em></span>,
let's not go there). For me, the perfect game can be fun even if I
can play only for a few minutes. It also has to be very quick to learn,
because &ldquo;learning to have fun&rdquo; isn't very much fun at all.
</p><p>
There are a few old standbys that work well: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bejeweled</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Peggle</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Plants vs. Zombies</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Candy
Crush</em></span> and so on. The problem is, although
those games are fun, I grow tired of them fairly quickly&mdash;either that
or they're so addictive I fear my family will disown me for ignoring
them while I play just one more level.
</p><p>
Here are some games I've been playing lately:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Swish</em></span>:
it's a puzzle game, but it's just different enough that I find it
fun. The physics seem &ldquo;right&rdquo; to me while playing, and the graphics are
really great. The premise is that you're an alien playing basketball in
space. You know, like aliens always do. There are 60 levels, and there's enough
of a challenge to make it fun.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dumb Ways to Die 2</em></span>:
I loved the first <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dumb Ways to Die</em></span> game. It was absurd. It was funny. It
was cartoonishly morbid. Part 2 is more of the same, and that's a very,
very good thing.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Asphalt Series</em></span>:
there are a bunch of games in the Asphalt racing series. Some of them
work better than others, and all of them are fairly large downloads. I
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Asphalt</em></span> because you get to race really cool cars really fast. If
you ever played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Burnout</em></span> on the PlayStation,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Asphalt</em></span> games will seem
pleasantly familiar. You have to pay for gas if you play for too long,
but I generally don't have enough time and play each session only until
my gas is gone.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11968androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
What are your favorite &ldquo;five-minute games&rdquo; for the Android platform? I 
never can really get into a book in that short amount of time, so it tends
to be the only time I play games. If you have any suggestions,
drop me a message at <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, and I'll try to follow up in later months with the
best of the best. 
</p><p>
Note: you can find all the games mentioned here in the Google Play Store.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: <span class="emphasis"><em>Snk</em></span></h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #262, February 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'm apparently in a silly-game mood this month, because I stumbled
across an open-source project I couldn't keep all to myself: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snk</em></span>. If
you remember the classic game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>snake</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snk</em></span> is the same concept,
but smaller, harder and with music.
</p><p>
I actually really like the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snk</em></span> program because it's fairly simple,
and the developer (Mowglii) has put the Xcode project on GitHub for
folks to download. If you're just starting with OS X Swift development,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Snk</em></span> is a project you can tweak for some learning on the fly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11968fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
My favorite part of the project is actually the &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; for it. Head
over to <a href="http://www.mowglii.com/snk" target="_self">www.mowglii.com/snk</a> to grab <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snk</em></span> and its source code
today. And, good luck with level three; I run directly into the wall every
time!

<h2 class="title">Astronomy for KDE</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #262, February 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Although I have covered a large number of science applications in this space, I haven't really looked
at too many options available within the KDE desktop environment. This has been due to my
own biases in using a GTK-based desktop environment, but now I'd like to look at some of the
packages available for people who really like to use KDE on their own
machines. So in this article, I'm starting off with the KStars astronomy program. 
</p><p>
If you have
the full KDE environment installed, you already should have it available. If you don't, you
should be able to install it. For example, you can install KStars on Debian-based
distributions with this command:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install kstars
</pre>
</p><p>
If this is the first KDE-based application that you are installing, it also will need to
pull in a rather large set of dependencies&mdash;that's just the price of using a new GUI
toolkit. Of course, any other packages will be incrementally smaller since all of the
shared dependencies already will be there.
</p><p>
To launch KStars, you either can click on a menu item in your desktop environment or
enter the <tt  >kstars</tt> command in a terminal window. 
The first time you
start KStars, you
need to go through the setup wizard to configure elements like your location.
Once KStars finishes starting up, you should see a display of the sky from
the location you set during the setup.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf1.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start KStars, you need to go through the setup wizard.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf2.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You get a display of the sky from your location when KStars starts.
</p></div></div><p>
You can pan the display around simply by clicking and dragging the star field to see
locations of interest. The items that are labeled depend on your zoom level.
Two buttons at the top of the display allow you to zoom in and out. Beside these is a
third button, labeled Find Object, that you can click on to get a search window. This
window can use filters to search for particular types of objects, like comets or
asteroids, or you can search through all of the objects that KStars knows about.
</p><p>
Once you find an object of interest, you can click on it and have the display move
around until the object is in the center of the display. If it is below the horizon, a
warning box will pop up asking if you still want to re-center the display.
Once you have selected your object, you can right-click on it to get a drop-down menu of
things you can do with it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf3.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can interact with the objects in the display.
</p></div></div><p>
The header of this drop-down contains the full name of the object, along
with rising and setting times. Below that, the first option is to center
and track the object. This is useful because the default display mode
is to have the display updated in real time. This way, you always have
a view of what the sky looks like right now. You can select the details
option to pull up even more information on the object. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11968kstarsf4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The detail window has a lot of extra information available for most objects.
</p></div></div><p>
You can add a flag to make the object easier to keep track of or even add tracks as the
object moves across the field of view. You also can calculate the angular distance to
another object or plan out a star-hopping path to some other object. 
</p><p>
For some objects,
there may be images from the Deep Sky Survey available. If they are, there will be
options on this drop-down menu labeled &ldquo;Show DSS Image&rdquo; or &ldquo;Show SDSS
Image&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Although KStars comes with quite a bit of data when you install it, this isn't everything
that is available. You can add new data sources by clicking on the menu item
Data&rarr;Download New Data. This will open up a new dialog window giving you a list of
what data catalogs are available to download. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf5.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Several extra data sets are available that you can download and install.
</p></div></div><p>
For some of the data sets, like comet and asteroid information, there is a constant
updating of the detailed information available to the astronomical community. You can
download those updates by clicking on the menu item Data&rarr;Updates&rarr; and selecting which
catalog to update. You even can import your own data by going to the configuration
window and clicking the Import Catalog... button on the Catalogs section. 
When you are in the configuration window, you can see that you also can change settings on how to
view several different categories, such as solar system objects, satellites and
supernovae.
</p><p>
The guides section defines what extra information is displayed, such as constellation
lines, names and the Milky Way. The INDI (Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface)
section controls how KStars talks to your connected telescope. 
You can pull up the
telescope wizard by clicking on Tools&rarr;Devices&rarr;Telescope Wizard.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf6.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can add a telescope as a device under the control of KStars.
</p></div></div><p>
Once the connection is made, you can pull up the control panel and send instructions to
your telescope. You can even automate your observations using this
functionality. Clicking on the menu item Observation&rarr;Observation Planner will pop
up a window where you can define a complete set of observations you want to run. If it
is a bit confusing at first, a wizard is available to help walk you through setting
up a plan.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf7.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Once it is connected to your computer, you can use KStars to control your
telescope.
</p></div></div><p>
While you will make your own observations, you also may want to look at observations made
by other researchers. The file format most often used is the FITS format (Flexible Image
Transport System). KStars includes a FITS viewer, which has a number of analysis tools.
You can open a FITS file by clicking on File&rarr;Open FITS.
</p><p>
Several tools are available to work with the data in the image. You can look at the
basic statistics of the image, including the width, height, maximum, minimum and mean of
the pixels. You can pull up a histogram, showing the frequency spread of the image data.
The View menu item includes several more tools where you can equalize the image, pass
it through a high contrast filter or apply an auto stretch. There is even an entry to
mark any stars that KStars can identify automatically.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11968kstarsf8.large.jpg"><img src="11968kstarsf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The FITS viewer lets you analyze and manipulate observational images.
</p></div></div><p>
You now have another astronomy program in your toolkit that you can use when your
scientific research moves in that direction. In the coming months, I plan to look at
other scientific software packages within this desktop environment and see just how much
research can be done with KDE.

My friend and fellow <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journalian</em></span> Kris Occhipinti recently posted a
reminder on Facebook for everyone to back up regularly in 2016. Although
it's something we already should be doing, if you're not a regular
backer-upper, you should start today! The method of backup isn't nearly
as important as the act itself, but this month, I found a new project
that simplifies the backup process nicely.
</p><p>
Poppins is an open-source project that builds on the SSH and rsync
programs to create an incremental backup system that is simple, fast
and reliable. Tons of other backup programs are available, but
Poppins doesn't try to be a full-blown system; rather, it's a simple one-liner
that will do file rotation, snapshots and more. It can be automated
with cron, or you can run it manually from the command line. (But you
should really, really make a cron job!)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11968poppinsf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Other backup systems have more robust interfaces, restoration
options and so on, but the beauty of Poppins is its simplicity. It's just one
step above manually running rsync yourself, but that one step means it's
simpler to do. In my world, simple is about the only way to make sure
something gets done at all!
</p><p>
In fact, even though it's a new project and still in beta, Poppins gets
this month's Editors' Choice award. It's simple enough that you might
actually get around to using it, and it has enough features to really
benefit you in the case of a catastrophic failure. Check it out today
at <a href="http://poppinsbackups.wordpress.com" target="_self">poppinsbackups.wordpress.com</a>, or go right to the Bitbucket
page: <a href="http://bitbucket.org/poppins" target="_self">bitbucket.org/poppins</a>.

<h2 class="title">Handheld Emulation: Achievement Unlocked!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #262, February 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love video game emulation. My favorite games were produced in the 1980s
and 1990s, so if I want to play them, I almost always have to emulate the
old systems. There is usually a legal concern about ROM files for games,
even if you own the original cartridges, so I'm not going to tell you
where to find ROMs to download or anything like that. What I <span   class="emphasis"><em>am</em></span> going to
share is my recent discovery of the perfect handheld gaming system. Oddly
enough, it was never intended to be an emulator.
</p><p>
The PSP is truly incredible hardware. The PSP Vita is its bigger,
younger sibling, but if you have an old PSP, I urge you not to throw it
away. With a simple firmware hack (also legally questionable, I suppose),
it's possible to load emulators that will play Atari, NES, SNES, Game Boy,
Genesis, PS1 and most other console games almost flawlessly.
</p><p>
I never had a PSP, but I was able to get a PSP Go in mint condition on
eBay for $89. The PSP Go comes with 16GB of storage, so you don't even
need to get its proprietary memory card to load it up with games!
</p><p>
One of the problems with the emulation scene is that sites seem
to come and go fairly regularly. I found all the information
I needed to get my PSP Go ready to play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mario</em></span> by doing some
Google searching for PSP emulators. Specifically, this page was great:
<a href="http://wololo.net/emulators-for-the-psp-ps-vita-the-ultimate-download-list" target="_self">wololo.net/emulators-for-the-psp-ps-vita-the-ultimate-download-list</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11968pspgof1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://wololo.net" target="_self">wololo.net</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
If you already have a PSP device, the instructions for custom firmware
installation is simple. If you don't have one, deciding which version of
the PSP to purchase is one of the toughest steps. If you like the larger
layout, I recommend the PSP 2000 model. It has an incredible screen
and fewer buggy design choices than the original. If you're looking for
portability, I'm very fond of the PSP Go I purchased from eBay. The screen
is smaller, but it's still plenty large and has beautiful quality. Good
luck, and have fun!
