Integrating memcached into your Rails application is easy and
fast, with big benefits.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x1892358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we talked about memcached, a distributed caching system
that is in widespread use among Web sites. The reason for memcached's
popularity is its simplicity. With a minimum of overhead and setup,
it's possible to set and retrieve nearly any value. Caching values
that otherwise would come from the database makes it possible to avoid
the database altogether on many occasions, speeding the throughput of
a Web application and reducing the load on the database server.
</p><p>
Memcached is a wonderful tool, and it is something nearly every Web
developer should have in his or her arsenal to improve site
performance. But with the release of Ruby on Rails 2.1, it got even
better. Rails now has integrated support for
memcached, allowing you to use it almost for free from within your
application. There are some caveats and tricks to its use, but once
you have those under your belt, you quickly will discover that
memcached has improved your site performance dramatically.
</p><p>
This month, we take a look at how to make memcached work
inside your Rails applications. We further explore some 
issues you might encounter when using memcached, some of
which are easier to work around than others.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x1892618"></a>
Cache Integration</h2></div></div><p>
Ruby on Rails has, since its inception, tried to make Web
developers' lives easier by coming out with many tools such 
developers might need. It comes with an excellent object-relational
mapper (ORM), ActiveRecord. It comes with a way to test your code at
a variety of different levels (called, in Rails-speak, unit,
functional and integration). It comes with a first-class
JavaScript library and associated effects, in Prototype and
Scriptaculous. As numerous demonstrations and tutorials have shown,
Rails allows you to jump right in to Web development, writing and
testing your code with a minimum of dependencies. If you need to
include some functionality that was left out by the Rails authors,
it's not very difficult to include a Ruby gem (downloadable
library) or even a &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; that sits inside your Rails
application.
</p><p>
Rails has long come with a multilayered caching system that
programmers can tap to speed up applications. You can cache
individual pages, controller actions or even page fragments. And
indeed, judicious use of the Rails caching commands can result in
serious improvements to performance.
</p><p>
But, it was only in version 2.1 that Rails integrated support for
caching individual objects. The support for object caching not only
has the potential to improve your
application's performance dramatically, but it also allows you to work with a variety of different
storage facilities, so you can choose the one that's most
appropriate for you. Although this article concentrates on the use
of memcached, you should know that it's possible to work with not only
memcached, but also with caches on the local filesystem, in local memory or
even on another Rails-aware server using DRb (distributed Ruby,
available as a Ruby gem).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x1892828"></a>
Caching a Simple Object</h2></div></div><p>
To demonstrate how to use memcached, I'm going to create a simple
Rails application, using PostgreSQL as the database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
createdb atf
rails --database=postgresql atf
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I create a simple object, person, for my application, with
the Rails built-in scaffolding that includes a RESTful interface:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate scaffold person firstname:string 
 &#8618;lastname:string email_address:string
</pre>
</p><p>
To import this definition into the database, I run the migration that
it created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, if I connect to the database, I can see that the table
has been created (Listing 1).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x1892b98"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Example Table</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
atf_development=# \d people
                      Table "public.people"
 Column       |            Type             | Modifiers
--------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------
id            | integer                     | not null default nextval
                                              &#8618;('people_id_seq'::regclass)
firstname     | character varying(255)      |
lastname      | character varying(255)      |
email_address | character varying(255)      |
created_at    | timestamp without time zone |
updated_at    | timestamp without time zone |
  Indexes:
      "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
</pre></div><p>
And, if I run the application, I have access (via the RESTful
interface) to the various CRUD functions associated with a Person
object: Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. I simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/server
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x1892e58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, I point my Web browser to port 3000 on my server:
http://atf.lerner.co.il:3000/people/.
</p><p>
So far, so good. With a few commands on the UNIX command line, I've
managed to create a simple database of people. I'll use the
scaffolded application to add several people, clicking on the New
person link and then adding the first name, last name and e-mail
address of each of my friends.
</p><p>
Now, if I look at the Rails development log, I easily can see that
each act I perform from within the scaffolded environment results
in an SQL query being built and sent to the PostgreSQL server. I
often do this by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f log/development.log
</pre>
</p><p>
For example, if I click on the show link for the first person I
created, I see the following in the development log:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Person Load (0.001571)   SELECT * FROM "people" 
 &#8618;WHERE ("people"."id" = 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, Rails knows that I want to load a Person object. It
also knows that I retrieve such objects from the database. This is
where ActiveRecord steps in, turning the Ruby:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Person.find(1)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x18931c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
into:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM people WHERE people.id = 1
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can imagine, it's not a big deal to do this sort of simple
query, particularly if you have a limited number of fields, a small
data set and a well-indexed primary key. But, as the number of fields
increases, you might find yourself wanting to reduce the load on
the database. Moreover, modern dynamic Web sites might need to
retrieve 5&ndash;10 different objects from the database, only some of which
are particular to the current user. If you get even 1,000 visitors to
your site each day, and if there are three objects on each page that
could be cached, that's 3,000 database queries you are foisting
upon your database unnecessarily.
</p><p>
Memcached is an obvious solution to this problem. With previous
versions of Rails, you needed to use a plugin or Ruby gem to do that.
Now, however, you can do it via a configuration file. The gem that you
previously needed to install, memcached-client, now is included
along with the Rails gem. Every Rails application contains a main
configuration file (config/environment.rb), which allows you to
configure your application using Ruby code. This is where you should
put configurations that are common to all three standard Rails
environments: development, testing and production. For
configurations that are specific to one environment, you instead
would modify config/environments/ENV.rb, where ENV should be replaced with
the environment of your choice.
</p><p>
Because we're still developing our example application, and using the
development environment, we can confine our changes to
config/environments/development.rb. Open that file in the editor of
your choice, and add the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells Rails that you want to use memcached and that the server
is on the local computer (localhost), using the default port 11211.
However, you can override these, and even put things into a separate
namespace, if you're worried about stepping on someone else's
objects.
</p><p>
When you're working in development mode, you also need to tell the
server to use caching, a parameter that is set (and false) by
default:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.action_controller.perform_caching = true
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x18935e8"></a>
Caching Objects</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's go in and modify the GET action within the controller that
was built for us by the scaffolding system. (The built-in caching is
designed to be used from controllers and views, rather than from
models.) That'll be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
app/controllers/people_controller.rb
</pre>
</p><p>
On line 16 of that file, you'll see:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@person = Person.find(params[:id])
</pre>
</p><p>
This is obviously where we invoke Person.find, as shown in the logs
earlier. Now, modify that line so it looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@person = cache(['Person', params[:id]]) do
  Person.find(params[:id])
end
</pre>
</p><p>
We still are assigning a value to @person. And, our call to
Person.find is still in there. However, Person.find now is buried
within a block. And, that block is attached to the call to a cache
function, which is given an array argument.
</p><p>
What's happening here is actually fairly straightforward. The cache
function looks in the cache for its argument, which is turned into a
key. If a value for this key exists in the cache, the value is
returned. If not, the block is executed, with the result of
executing the block stored in the cache and returned to the caller.
</p><p>
With this code in place, let's retrieve person #1 again and look at
the logfile. The first time we do this, the value is indeed retrieved
from the database, as before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Person Load (0.002212)   SELECT * FROM "people" 
 &#8618;WHERE ("people"."id" = 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
That line is followed by this new entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Cache write (will save 0.01852): controller/Person/1
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, our memcached server reports:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;7 new client connection
&lt;7 get controller/Person/1
&gt;7 END
&lt;7 set controller/Person/1 0 0 224
&gt;7 STORED

</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, our Rails controller did exactly as we asked. It
contacted memcached and asked for the value of controller/Person/1.
(We can see from this that controller is prefaced to the key name
that we create, and that elements of the cache key array are
separated by slashes.) When we get a null value back for that, Rails
retrieves the value from the database and then issues a set command
in memcached, storing our value.
</p><p>
As you might expect, we then can refresh our browser window and see
that we are saving a great deal of database time by retrieving
information about this person from the cache. So, we refresh the
browser window, and...boom! Our application blows up on us, with an
error message that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
undefined class/module Person
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, the first time this happened to me, I wasn't sure what 
hit me. What do you mean, I asked my computer, you don't know how to
find a Person class? A little head-scratching and Google searching
later, and I found my answer. I needed to tell the controller to
load the object definition by putting the following at the top of my
controller:

<pre     class="programlisting">
require_dependency 'person'
</pre>
</p><p>
This is apparently necessary only in development mode, and it has
something to do with the way Rails reloads classes while you
are developing your application. With that line in place, you can
reload the page. In the logfile, you'll see no trace of a successful
call to the database. Instead, you'll find the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Cache hit: controller/Person/1 ({})
</pre>
</p><p>
Meanwhile, our memcached log will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;7 get controller/Person/1
&gt;7 sending key controller/Person/1
&gt;7 END

</pre>
</p><p>
This is a good time to mention the only other gotcha I can
think of: whitespace is forbidden in memcached keys. This can be a
problem if you use a value from the database (for example, a parameter name)
as the key when storing things in memcached. The simple solution is
to remove the whitespace, either by running String#gsub on each of the
keys or by monkey-patching String (as I did for an application I
wrote) to add a to_key method. I could then pass <tt  >"parameter
name".to_mkey</tt> as an argument to cache().
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x179a580.0x188a818"></a>
Expiration</h2></div></div><p>
Now, it's all well and good that we have cached information about each
person in memcached. Our database certainly will thank us for that.
But, what happens when data about the person changes? The way 
we've written this application, we're out of luck. Updated information
will make its way to the database, but the cache will continue to give
us the data it stored long ago. Even if this weren't the case,
we still would want to empty the cache on occasion, allowing data to
expire if we haven't used it in a while.
</p><p>
To solve the second problem, we can invoke our cache function in a
slightly different way, indicating how long we want it to stick
around in a second (and optional) argument:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@person = cache(['Person', params[:id]],
                :expires_in =&gt; 30.minutes) do
  Person.find(params[:id])
end
</pre>
</p><p>
The :expires_in parameter accepts a number of seconds, which we 
either can enter by hand or via one of the super-convenient Rails
extensions to the Fixnum class.
</p><p>
The second problem, one of expiring data manually, requires that we
use a less beautiful, but also convenient, way of accessing the cache
storage system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Rails.cache.delete(['controller', 'Person', 
 &#8618;params[:id]].join('/'))
</pre>
</p><p>
Basically, we access the cache system using the Rails.cache object
and invoke the delete method on it. That method accepts a memcached
key. As you might remember, we previously saw that the elements of our
key array (as used by the helpful cache method) were joined by
slashes and prefixed with controller. Thus, the above works, even
though it's not quite as nice as I might have liked. We can see that
this is the case in the memcached logs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;7 delete controller/Person/1 0
&gt;7 DELETED

</pre>
</p><p>
And, sure enough, we then find that our next invocation of show for
person 1 retrieves the information from the database and caches it in
memcached.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Caching has long been an excellent way to improve performance in the
computer industry, from the hardware level all the way up to operating
systems and applications. Rails programmers have incorporated
memcached into their applications over the last few years, but I
believe that its complete integration in version 2.1 will make it even
easier, and more widespread, to find memcached-enabled Rails
applications. As you can see, adding just a few lines of
configuration and application code can speed up an application by many
times, without having to sacrifice accuracy.
