Dave begins a new series of columns on shell variable notation.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171f580.0x18174b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There I was, trying to come up with a topic for this column, when I did what
I usually do when stumped: I sent a question out to my Twitter followers.
This time, I got a great answer, from John Minnihan: &ldquo;How about how
special vars inside a script, for example, <tt  >#!/bin/bash script="${0##*/}"
current=`dirname "$0"` cd $current; make</tt>?&rdquo;
</p><p>
That's a good topic, so let's dig into it, starting with the basics
this month, shall we?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171f580.0x1817778"></a>
The Easy Special Variables</h2></div></div><p>
The basic notation of variables in the shell is $varname, but I bet
you've already used a few special notations without really thinking
about it. For example, want to know how many positional parameters (aka
starting arguments) you received when the script was invoked?
Using $# gives you
the value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "you gave me $# parameters"
</pre>
</p><p>
Want to get a specific positional parameter from the starting command line?
That's done with other special variables: $1, $2, $3 and so on. These
are rather odd cases actually, and the shift command 
shifts them all down one, so you easily can parse and trim command flags.
</p><p>
Try this snippet to see what I'm talking about:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "arg1 = $1" ; shift ; echo "now arg1 = $1"
</pre>
</p><p>
The variable $0 is a special one in this sequence. It's the name of the
script or program invoked. This can be quite helpful, because it means you
can add multiple commands to your Linux shell with a single shared script
base.  
</p><p>
Let's say that you want to add &ldquo;happy&rdquo; and &ldquo;sad&rdquo; as two
new command-line options, but you want to do it within a single script.
Easy! Write the script, save as &ldquo;happy&rdquo;, create a symbolic link that
means &ldquo;sad&rdquo; points to &ldquo;happy&rdquo;, and put this in the script
itself:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$0" = "happy" ] ; then
  echo "I am so darn happy too, hurray!"
else
  echo "Sorry you're sad. Why not take a walk?"
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
See how that works? It turns out that there's a nuance to this usage,
however, because you often get the full path in the $0 variable, so most
people use $(basename $0) instead of just utilizing the $0 directly. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171f580.0x1817d50"></a>
Checking Your Status</h2></div></div><p>
Another special variable that you might have encountered is the status
variable, $?. In a script, this contains the return value of the most
recently executed (external) command. 
</p><p>
This is where you need to read man pages so you know what to
expect on success and failure, but as an example, consider the
test command. According to the man page, &ldquo;if [the
expression] evaluates to true, it returns a zero (true) exit status; otherwise
it returns 1 (false). If there is no expression, test also returns 1
(false).&rdquo;
</p><p>
This means you could do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
test 1 --eq 3
if $? ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
Quick, now, would we be within this conditional statement or not?
That's where it's tricky because zero = true and nonzero = false,
which is somehow opposite to how we naturally think of conditional tests
(well, how I think of them, at least). In fact, the above test would be
testing 1,
because the &ldquo;test&rdquo; would evaluate to false, and its return value
also would be false.
</p><p>
Now, using test like this is a sort of daft example, but what
if you wanted to create a subdirectory and then test to see if it was
successful? That's a perfect use for $?, actually:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir $newdir
if [ $? --ne 0 ] ; then
   echo "We failed to make the directory $newdir"
</pre>
</p><p>
It turns out that you also can streamline this sort of thing by having the
&ldquo;if&rdquo; directly evaluate the return code: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
if mkdir $newdir ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a better coding style, although it can be confusing if you are used
to having conditional expressions be value tests, not actually commands
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>do something</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171f580.0x18182d0"></a>
A Few More Useful Special Variables</h2></div></div><p>
A special variable that I use with great frequency for helping create
temporary file names is $$, which expands to the current process ID in the
system. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $$
3243
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're doing a lot with subshells or spawning subcommands, another
useful variable is $!, which is the process ID of the most recently spawned
background command. I've never used this in any of my shell scripts,
but you might find a situation where it's helpful.
</p><p>
The last example I'll talk about here is most useful when you want to
hand starting parameters to subshells. The two options are $* and $@, and
it's so convoluted to explain the difference that it's easier just
to demonstrate.
</p><p>
Let's start with a tiny script that simply reports how many parameters
it's given:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
echo "I was given $# parameters"
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
I'll call that subshellcount.sh and utilize it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
echo "you gave me $# variables and the first is $1"
echo "unprotected parameters:"
./subshellcount.sh  $1 $2 $3 $4
echo "or, more succinctly:"
./subshellcount.sh $*
echo "but when we put \$* in quotes:"
./subshellcount.sh "$*"
echo "by comparison, same thing with \$@:"
./subshellcount.sh "$@"
</pre>
</p><p>
Watch what happens when I invoke it with three parameters, one of which has
a space embedded: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh test.sh I love "Linux Journal"
you gave me 3 variables and the first is I
unprotected parameters:
I was given 4 parameters
or, more succinctly:
I was given 4 parameters
but when we put $* in quotes:
I was given 1 parameters
by comparison, same thing with $@:
I was given 3 parameters
</pre>
</p><p>
Can you see the difference here? When we don't take efforts to protect
the space in the third positional parameter (either by just referencing $3
or using the $@ without quotes), it splits into two parameters to the
subshell, and we get a count of four.
</p><p>
Quoting by itself doesn't do the trick either, because of the
difference between $@ and $*. With the latter, everything expands without
&ldquo;breaking out of&rdquo; the quotes, so $* ends up being a
single positional parameter to the subshell. Fortunately, $@
works exactly as we'd like, and the subshell gets three parameters, not
one, not four.
</p><p>
It seems a bit trivial, but when you start working with filenames that have
spaces in them, for example, you quickly will learn just how tricky it is
to get all of this correct!
</p><p>
I'm going to stop here, and starting next month, we'll delve into
the more obscure and complex shell variable notation. It's interesting
stuff.
