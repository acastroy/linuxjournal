Keryx&mdash;Packaging Solution for the Net-Deprived
(<a href="http://keryx.betaserver.org" target="_self">keryx.betaserver.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
One of my chief bug bears of Linux systems over the last eight years or
so is the high level of dependence on Net connectivity and the constant
assumption that you even have a connection in the first place. &ldquo;I'm trying
to compile MPlayer, but there are dependency problems.&rdquo; &ldquo;Just install it
with apt, it's easy.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don't have the Net.&rdquo; Blank
stare. My twin brother,
for example, is a loyal Linux user and lives in a flat where it's hard
to get a connection, and as a musician, it's very hard for him to stay
in Linux to do his work, because the programs he needs have niggling
dependencies. These can take a day to resolve when he has to go to an
Internet caf&eacute;, grabbing random .deb files and hoping they work.
</p><p>
Well for all you Net-deprived people, I feel your pain, and so does
Chris Oliver, with his new program Keryx. Keryx is a free, open-source
application for updating Ubuntu. The Keryx Project started as a way for
users with dial-up or low-bandwidth Internet to be able to download and
update packages on their Debian-based distribution of Linux. Mainly built
for Ubuntu, Keryx allows users to select packages to install and check for
updates and download those packages onto a USB key. The packages are
saved onto the device and then can be taken back to the Linux box 
to be installed. Because of the design, Keryx can
be run on <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> OS that has Python, GTK and PyGTK installed. For Ubuntu
(GNOME) users, everything is pre-installed. Windows users also will have
no software to install, because Keryx and everything it depends on will
be made to run portably off a USB Flash drive.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10287f1.large.jpg"><img src="10287f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Keryx offers an impressive way of managing packages on PCs without
a Net connection.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10287f2.large.jpg"><img src="10287f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Keryx saves packages that can be used between multiple machines and
distributions&mdash;very handy.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you've got a standard Ubuntu system, you're set. If you have a
variant of some sort, make sure you install all of the standard GTK,
Python and PyGTK libraries before continuing. Head to the Web site,
grab the latest tarball, extract it somewhere locally and open a terminal
in the main keryx directory. And, that's it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
In the main keryx folder, enter the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python keryx.py
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll be greeted by the main screen where the first thing you
need to do is start a new project with the aptly titled New Project
button. Each project is designed to keep track of a different computer's
packages, meaning you can take care of multiple machines with the one
USB stick. Once you've entered your project name, you'll be prompted
to choose between Local Files or Internet. Local Files is meant
for those without any connection at all, but at this point,
there's no technical difference between either Local Files or Internet. At this stage, Keryx
will appear to hang, but it isn't, it's just processing a whole bunch of
repository information&mdash;things about local files and so on. Give it a minute
or two, and it should be back with you.
</p><p>
Once Keryx has sprung back to life, you'll be presented with a long
list of packages, Synaptic style. For choosing packages to install, the
interface is a little quirky. Those tick boxes won't let you choose a
package; they just tell you whether it's installed already. To install
a package, click on the actual name of the package, and if you want
multiple packages, Ctrl-click or Shift-click the same way you would in any
modern file manager. When you're ready to download the packages, click
Download Selected at the top-right of the screen. Keryx will
download everything and save any downloaded packages to the packages
folder in the main keryx directory.
</p><p>
From here, you'll have to install these packages yourself manually,
either by command line with dpkg or with a package management program
under X. It's a bit of pain, I'll admit. However, this project is very young,
the interface is still very much in its infancy, and adding the option
to install the packages from within Keryx should take only a few GUI
shortcuts to some pretty basic commands. It's in its early days, but it does genuinely
look promising, with a planned Mac port even in the works once the project
becomes more stable. Poor Linux enthusiasts without the Net rejoice. In the
near future, your savior may be arriving in the form of Keryx!

LanguageTool&mdash;Style and Grammar Checker for OOo
(<a href="http://www.languagetool.org" target="_self">www.languagetool.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I find that after submitting an article and reading it again
a few days later when my brain's fresh, I've made some heinous grammatical
error somewhere and not noticed it. And, that's what I've just sent to the
editor. Spiffing. Well, it's not like the spell-checker picked it up,
is it? I read through it several times, but still, I missed it. Well,
Daniel Naber has just the thing for me with the imaginatively titled
LanguageTool.
</p><p>
LanguageTool is a grammar-checking plugin for OpenOffice.org
based on Java with support for English, Polish, German, French and
Dutch, and basic support for some other languages, such as Swedish
and Russian. LanguageTool scans words and their part-of-speech tags
for occurrences of error patterns that are defined in an XML file,
and more powerful error rules can be written in Java and added later.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10287f3.large.jpg"><img src="10287f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
LanguageTool&mdash;it's like having your own Noel Coward plugin for
OpenOffice.org.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10287f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
There's an impressive array of grammatical rules available with
LanguageTool.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Head to the Web site, but before you download the plugin, you
need to choose between two versions. One is for the 2.x series; the
other is for the newer 3.x beta series. If you'd like a demo before you
install it, there's a link on the site to do just that, and it'll run in
your browser provided you've got basic Java plugins. Speaking of Java,
you need version 5 of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sun's</em></span> Java, not one of these alternative
jobbies. Once you've selected your version, save it to the hard drive and open
up your version of OpenOffice.org Writer.
</p><p>
To install the plugin, click Tools&rarr;Extension Manager, and once
inside the Extension Manager window, click the Add... button and
browse for the .oxt file you downloaded earlier. Once you've done this,
LanguageTool should be installed. Close OOo and restart it, and it
should be good to go. Before we move onto usage though, I can't stress
enough how important it is to have the right Java packages installed. If
you have Sun Java 5 installed and the following steps aren't working
for you, make sure you install all of the other Java packages, like jre
and so on.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
With LanguageTool installed, the first thing you need to do is
choose your language. Click Tools&rarr;LanguageTool&rarr;Configuration,
and once inside the configuration screen, choose your default language
under the drop-down box titled Your mother tongue:. Notice that big
list of language rules? It's pretty impressive, don't you think? For those
with OOo 3.x, life is slightly easier. Simply type
some text in the main screen, and it should check it automatically
(the Web site recommends typing &ldquo;This is an test.&rdquo; for some deliberately
bad grammar). For those on the 2.x series of OOo, you need to choose
Tools&rarr;LanguageTool&rarr;Check Text each time you want to check some text.
</p><p>
Once installed, I found LanguageTool an intuitive tool with a familiar
interface that I now will use in my daily work (much to the joy of our
editor I should imagine). Check it out.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span>&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Commander Keen</em></span> Port
(<a href="http://clonekeen.sourceforge.net" target="_self">clonekeen.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
At the very beginning of the 1990s, side-scrolling platformers were the
order of the day, and gaming consoles were having unprecedented success
with the likes of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mario Bros.</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sonic</em></span>. So, what about the PC? Enter
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Commander Keen</em></span>. Developed by the now-famous id
Software, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Commander Keen</em></span>
(or just <span   class="emphasis"><em>Keen</em></span> as it was often called) had unrivaled gameplay,
level design, smooth scrolling and a solid feel to it
that was missing in other games. id soon would go on to develop other
ground-breaking titles, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wolfenstein 3D</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and eventually, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, and in
the same way that these landmark games were all superior to their rivals,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Keen</em></span> had the gameplay and feel to it that was simply unmatched. Play it
now, and it still makes sense. Get six-year-olds to play
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Keen</em></span> for five
minutes, and you won't have to explain why it's good or say how great it
was at the time&mdash;they'll just know. And, it's not just nostalgic me that
sees it as a classic either; any Steam users can download the series and
play it through the DOSBox emulator on their modern PCs. But, that's still
really just emulation, and Caitlin Shaw has other ideas with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span>&mdash;
a restoration of the original three <span   class="emphasis"><em>Keen</em></span> episodes running natively using
SDL, making it portable to a large number of platforms including Linux,
Windows, the GP2X, the Dreamcast and PSP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10287f5.large.jpg"><img src="10287f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Another deeper gameplay element of <span  class="emphasis"><em>Commander Keen</em></span>: its very own
alphabet that is decoded later in the series.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10287f6.large.jpg"><img src="10287f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span> adds some crazy new elements to the original
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Keen</em></span> like this
insane two-player mode.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span> still is in a state of flux and needs some
cleaning up on the Linux side. I got <span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span> working and compilation
certainly is doable, but any comprehensive instructions would be too long
to include here and may well have changed by the time this goes to print,
so please check the readme file and the Web site's instructions. That's
about all I can say in that regard; however, I can give you a few tips
before you embark on a compilation fest. First, you need a copy
of the original episodes, and more important, you need to copy
these into <span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span>'s data folder. Second, once in the src folder,
you need to copy the Makefile.lnx to the Makefile like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cp Makefile.lnx Makefile 
</pre>
</p><p>
Third, enter <tt  >make clean</tt> before entering
<tt  >make</tt>,
or you'll run into errors. But finally, Caitlin herself says that she just
mostly uses the Windows binary package and copies the compiled Linux
keen binary into the folder of the Windows package and runs the keen
binary from there (and trust me, for the moment, it's easier). I realise
that's not really all that helpful, but hopefully by the time you read
this,
the installation will be cleaned up.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
If you've been lucky enough to get it working, any key will get you
into the main screen. Under Options, you can adjust the screen size so
that you don't have a tiny little window, but I recommend full screen for
the authentic feel with smooth scrolling. Start a new one-player game, and
you can control the character using the arrow keys, with Ctrl for jump,
Alt for the pogo stick once you have it, and Ctrl and Alt in combination
to fire the raygun. Otherwise, I'll let you figure it out from there
(especially the two-player mode, which I haven't had the proper chance
to explore).
</p><p>
Overall, this project is still a bit unstable, with screen errors,
sound errors and the like, but if you can get it working, it's
well worth the effort. This game really is a classic, and ten minutes
of playing time should speak for itself. Plus, the addition of the crazy
two-player mode as well as new options, such as &ldquo;Fully Automatic
Raygun&rdquo;, should give the game a breath of fresh air and a new angle
of play. Give it a go or even check it out on Steam if you're lazy. In
the meantime, I'm going to have a go at the PSP version.
