A simple solution combining Darknet and IDS.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc66580.0xd5e250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We've all heard the stories about botnets and some emerging, professional
tools to manage them in a business-like style, but 
many engineers probably have not had an opportunity to play with them or even research
them completely.
</p><p>
Botnets and computer zombies are increasing
dramatically. The ShadowServer Foundation continues to gather
interesting statistics on this trend, showing how many botnets were
found in the last two years (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10242f1.large.jpg"><img src="10242f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Known Botnets in the Past Two Years
</p></div></div><p>
The questions are simple. How can we be sure that no zombie
computers exist on our network? Are patching, antivirus, anti-rootkit and
antispam protections sufficient? Is something else is necessary? Can
we really trust one leading security IT vendor? Would it be better to
implement two? Should we exercise some other techniques?
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there are no easy answers to those questions. In March 2008, 
a security company called Damballa was the source of news that a new
Kraken botnet existed in the wild and was far more resource-reaching than the Storm
one. Damballa reported seeing approximately 400,000 compromised computers
(victims)&mdash;some of them from at least 50 Fortune 500 companies. It's an
interesting example, because many security (mostly antivirus) vendors responded
quickly that they already had protection in place and that the threat was
old, so no need to worry. Was this really a threat, and how did
Damballa get these numbers?
</p><p>
To simplify the story, Damballa discovered (probably during a
security audit) a new malware with hard-coded addresses (URLs) of control
centers (CCs&mdash;computers that manage tasks for zombie machines and
all infected computers report to them).
Damballa also found that some of those hard-coded
addresses were not registered in a DNS service (the botnet probably was tested
at that time, and the authors were preparing to launch it later). Damballa
registered those domains as its own and ended up controlling quite a large
botnet for research. Now, Damballa could identify IP addresses of zombie
computers that started to report to its CC, and it discovered 
a number of devices sitting inside large corporate networks. Damballa could
play with the bots and discover their potential
power for malicious activity.
</p><p>
Much discussion has ensued about Damballa's ethical behavior. It hasn't contacted any security company about the methods of
infection it discovered. It hasn't published any details of the
exploits used to any bugtrack, nor has it contacted any vendors to alert
them of the issue. Damballa wanted all the credit itself.
</p><p>
I don't approve of those things, but as a security
technologist, having the opportunity to research such botnets is
really tempting, and I can understand (but still not agree with) those
decisions. Having an army of zombies under the control of a security
organization is much better than having them in the wild. On the
other hand, Damballa allowed malware to spread undetected just to justify
its research.
</p><p>
But, that's not the point. The real point is Damballa proved that
undetected botnets could exist, even in highly secured environments, in
companies that have dedicated resources to fighting malware.
</p><p>
So, if large corporations that have committed a small fortune to
protect system and network resources can be vulnerable, who's
safe?
Apparently, having state-of-the-art antivirus and malware protection isn't
enough. What can you do about it, and how should you protect
your IT systems and fight undetectable malware?
</p><p>
One solution is something called Darknet.
</p><p>
The idea of Darknet isn't new. It evolved from honeypots&mdash;a solution
that's undervalued and underestimated, although it's really easy to implement.
The term Darknet refers to a private or public chunk of a network that
is empty of any servers/services.
In fact, there is at least one silent host on this network, catching and
inspecting all packets. We can call it a silent honeypot.
The idea is simple. We don't expect any traffic on this network, so
any packet found here is not legitimate and needs to be analyzed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10242f2.large.jpg"><img src="10242f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Darknet sits quietly waiting and listening.
</p></div></div><p>
As shown in Figure 2, the network has been divided into two parts
with a /26 mask. The Darknet part consists of silent &ldquo;traffic
catchers&rdquo;
or Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS).
</p><p>
There are plenty of sophisticated commercial Network Intrusion Detection
Systems, but if you don't want to pay a lot of money, you can use some
of the open-source and free solutions, such as Snort, Argus or even
the fully functional Darknet solution from Team Cymru (see Resources).
These tools allow you to gather detailed packets for analysis of new or
zero-day exploits in the wild.
</p><p>
Figure 3 from the Team Cymru Web site shows how Darknet detected a worm
just minutes after its release.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10242f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Notice the unusual spike in traffic.
</p></div></div><p>
In this example, Darknet has a public address space, which means it will
catch all the traffic from outside the network. So, we will
have all the information about what threats are currently in the wild, and we will
be alerted about new traffic patterns and potential zero-day exploits.
But, how can we detect botnets inside our network?
To answer that question, we need to look deeper into malware
behavior.
</p><p>
About 90% of malware these days behaves in specific and common
ways, so from the network traffic perspective, we can say that typical
malware has some distinct characteristics:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
It will assure its survival. It's not exactly network-related, but
it will copy itself to the Start folder or add itself to startup scripts or
the registry (Windows).
</p></li><li><p>
It will try to replicate and spread (infect other computers in its
neighborhood) by searching for
e-mail addresses and sending messages from a user's mailbox (mail channel);
creating files on Windows shared folders, network drives and P2P shares
(let's call that the P2P channel); or direct infections&mdash;using zero-day exploits
on unpatched systems.
</p></li><li><p>
It will try to contact the control center (CC) to download other
malware and to get instructions&mdash;usually from Web sites (Web channel)
or Internet Relay Chat (IRC channel). Often these CCs are located
on computers using dynamic IP addresses (dynamic DNS) or located in
countries known to be sources of malicious software (China, Russia and so
forth) or on suspicious networks (such as the so-called Russian Business
Network).
</p></li><li><p>
It will be used for malicious purposes&mdash;typically spam (mail channel), data
leakage/spyware/identity theft/phishing, DDOS, ransomware, often via
the Web channel also.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
As we can see, malware often uses the most popular channels to spread and
operate&mdash;mainly Web, mail, P2P and IRC channels.
</p><p>
Knowing this information, we can create a Darknet inside our network and place some
traffic catchers or IDS systems there to analyze and gather all suspicious data.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10242f4.large.jpg"><img src="10242f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Suspicious packets are examined instead of simply discarded.
</p></div></div><p>
The method shown in Figure 4 can be explained in one sentence:
&ldquo;All outgoing traffic that is not legitimate (violates a company's policy)
or traffic that is suspicious will be forwarded for analysis.&rdquo;
</p><p>
One question remains. How do we decide what traffic is malicious or
unwanted? The ultimate solution would be to forward all packets with
an &ldquo;evil bit&rdquo; set in a funny way (RFC 3514). Unfortunately,
this is a little more complicated.
</p><p>
Let's consider an example. If we have a company with internal mail and
a name server (DNS/WINS), we can redirect all outgoing traffic
(other than from these servers) to ports TCP 25 (SMTP), TCP/UDP 53
(DNS), TCP 6667-6669 (IRC) and all known P2P software (like Limeware)
to Darknet hosts for analyses. As computers inside the network don't
really send traffic directly to mail servers or connect to
the IRC, we can block these channels to avoid spreading malware. If
the nature of a company's business is focused on a local area or country, we
also can redirect all WWW port TCP 80 requests to suspicious domains
(such as .cn or .ru), dynamic DNS domains and so on.
</p><p>
To accomplish this task, we can set up basic iptables rules on a Linux
firewall, as in this example (we are redirecting all requests coming
from an internal eth0 interface destined for TCP 6669 IRC port to internal
host 1.1.1.1):

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 
 &#8618;6669 -j DNAT --to 1.1.1.1:6669
iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -i eth0 -d 1.1.1.1 --dport 
 &#8618;6669 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
We also will need to configure the internal server with address 1.1.1.1 to
catch all the traffic. There are two ways to do that: we 
can record all the packets going to this server, or we can install some
services (WWW, IRC, SMTP, POP3, DNS) and then monitor them for connections
and integrity.
</p><p>
Let's focus on a simple packet-capture machine. More sophisticated
solutions (such as the ones from antivirus companies) usually have a
dozen machines (most likely VMware images) with different operating
systems, open shares, Web servers, P2P clients, mail agents, instant-messaging clients and so on.
</p><p>
After the attack/infection, system changes will be compared to the
input state (VMware snapshot) to analyze malware behavior and to ease
the remediation process.
</p><p>
Such labs can be very complex, but to achieve basic functionality (traffic
monitoring and threat alerting), it is enough to have one computer with your
favorite Linux distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc66580.0xd5f8a8"></a>
Traffic Monitoring</h2></div></div><p>
One of the many tools for sniffing traffic and gathering statistics
is ntop. You can download it from <a href="http://www.ntop.org" target="_self">www.ntop.org</a> or use a package
manager on your system to install it. There already are cooked packages
for popular Linux distributions, such as Red Hat, Debian/Ubuntu and SUSE.
Before using it, you have to set up an admin password by running the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo ntop --set-admin-password
</pre>
</p><p>
And start it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo /etc/init.d/ntop start
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can go to your IP address (http://127.0.0.1:300) and look for
some statistics. This is a very powerful tool that provides
a lot of information. You can sort by packets, ports,
hosts and so on. Network usage graphs also are helpful in determining the amount of
traffic getting into your system.
</p><p>
Remember, no packets should be legitimate in Darknet, so this tool provides
great statistical data as to what hosts/networks are responsible
for illegal traffic.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10242f5.large.jpg"><img src="10242f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. ntop breaks down the flagged traffic to help identify the source
of illegal traffic.
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 5 shows ntop's graphic interface and its ability to
detect host operating systems, vendor and other details in Host view.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10242f6.large.jpg"><img src="10242f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

support for RRDTool.

Threat Alerting</h2></div></div><p>
To get alerts regarding what exploits are used (if any) on your
network, you
need a network IDS system. The best one that's publicly available is
Snort. You can get it from <a href="http://www.snort.org" target="_self">www.snort.org</a>, and it also
is available
on many systems as a binary package.
</p><p>
One thing you need to configure in /etc/snort/snort.conf is setting
your $HOME_NETWORK variable to match IP addresses and netmask to your
configuration. Snort is an intrusion detection system based on a pattern
database.
</p><p>
If traffic matches, it will write an alert to a log file (by default in
/var/log/snort) and record the packets for later analysis (you can reply
to them using the <tt  >tcpdump -r</tt> command or examine them
using tools like Wireshark). 
</p><p>
With powerful yet not complicated rules, you can write your own
signatures or edit existing ones to record traffic that matches your
custom criteria. Additionally, you can consider installing Snort support
tools, such as IDScenter (see Resources).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10242f7.large.jpg"><img src="10242f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The honeypot GUI shows recorded incidents.
</p></div></div><p>
There also is a Honeynet project, based on Snort and Sebek
technologies. It provides a cut-down Linux system, based on Fedora and
custom-built tools with a GUI for incident management (Figure 7).
</p><p>
If you want to go further, there also are projects, such as HIHAT
(Highly Interactive Honeypot Analyses Toolkit), that transform
popular PHP applications, such as PHPNuke or osCommerce, to fully functional
logging, reporting and alerting tools.
</p><p>
You easily can detect commands and SQL injections, cross-site scripting
and map involved IPs to geographic locations, as shown in Figure 8.

Results</h2></div></div><p>
This simple configuration of putting a server on an internal Darknet
allows us to detect and receive alerts on the following:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Actively spreading malware.
</p></li><li><p>
Covert channels and possible data leakage.
</p></li><li><p>
Suspicious activities (deliberate or not), such as abuse of a company's
policy and
network reconnaissance attempts (for example, port scanning).
</p></li><li><p>
Provide audit trails and record evidence for later investigation.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide general network usage statistics for base-lining.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc66580.0x1158e90"></a>
Not All Traffic Is Malicious</h2></div></div><p>
Although you decided to block IRC access from inside the network, it might
not be that clear for other employees in your company. If Mary from another
department tries to connect to her favorite IRC channel at lunchtime,
you'll probably catch it, but that doesn't mean there is a malware on
Mary's workstation trying to contact the control center.
However, a number of the same type of connections from one or multiple
computers often is a good indication that something is going wrong.
</p><p>
In my work every day, I see some strange behavior. People always
are trying to install illegitimate software, sometimes without even 
knowing it. Sometimes an employee's children try continuously installing Limewire
on a company laptop given to them for playing a game or browsing the Internet.
</p><p>
With a little bit of information, you should be able to gather some
statistics and distinguish real threats from normal misuse or other
isolated incidents.
</p><p>
Securing information systems is a very hard task. Today we are in
ongoing war against attackers&mdash;fighting the battles of time
and money. Time is crucial in securing all environments when there is a
threat in the wild, but first you need to know about it.
If you know your enemies, their intentions and weapons, it is much easier to
react and mitigate attacks.
That's what Darknet and honeypots are all about.
