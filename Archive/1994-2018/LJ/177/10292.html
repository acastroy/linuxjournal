Start creating shares on your secure Samba file server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x23af460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This month, we continue our exercise in building a secure file server for
our local LAN using Samba. In case you missed the first two installments,
this is a non-Internet-accessible file server to which users of a LAN
can mount virtual disk volumes.
</p><p>
The example scenario I'm using is a boarding house in which I need
to provide a world-readable file share containing menus (SUPPER),
a group-readable share containing schedules of chores (CHORES) and a
private share containing copies of Web logs (BUZZ-OFF).
</p><p>
Last month, we used Samba's Swat tool to configure our Samba server's
Global settings. We then created four user accounts: mick, knute, pepe
and skippy. Mick, of course, is me. Knute, Pepe and Skippy are the
three FBI agents who rent my rooms and who are interested in my daily menus
and weekly schedules of chores, but with whom I'd rather not share my
Web logs.
</p><p>
This month, we create a public share for menus called SUPPER and a
nonpublic but group-readable share for chore lists called CHORES. (We'll
save the private share, BUZZ-OFF, for next time.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x23af720"></a>
Creating a World-Readable File Share</h2></div></div><p>
As we've seen, Swat is arguably the best tool for configuring smb.conf,
Samba's primary configuration file. Other tasks, like creating new user
accounts, are best done from a command line (last month, we used the
standard commands useradd and passwd to set up our accounts under
Linux, and then smbpasswd to create corresponding Samba accounts).
</p><p>
To create shares, however, we can return to Swat. Unsurprisingly, the
navigation button you must click is labeled Shares. After you do that,
type the name SUPPER in the box to the right of the Create Share
button, and then click that button. You should see something like Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10292f1.large.jpg"><img src="10292f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Creating a New File Share
</p></div></div><p>
Under Base Options, I set comment to Mick's Menus. Then, I set
path to /home/mick/supper. This will be our weekly menu folder.
</p><p>
The value of path has to correspond to a real directory on your
server. Furthermore, the Linux permissions and ownership of this directory
need to be set to allow the desired level of access you want to
grant. In this example, the directory listing of /home/mick/supper looks
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
drwxr-xr-x 2 mick users 4096 2008-09-12 01:44 supper/
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the user mick has read-write-execute permissions, but
group and other have only read-execute permissions. Now isn't the time
for a primer on filesystem security (actually I've already written one:
&ldquo;Linux Filesystem Security&rdquo;, in the October and November 2004
issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>). Suffice
it to say for now that the commands for creating directories, setting
user and group ownership and setting permissions, respectively, are
mkdir, chown, chgrp and chmod.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x23afc48"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
A Note on Figures 1 and 2</b></p><p>
The screenshots in Figures 1 and 2 show Ubuntu's default values for
the various settings in Swat. They, therefore, do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> provide,
all by themselves, a model of how to configure Samba securely! Read the
accompanying text for my recommended (secure) settings.
</p></div><p>
Let's set some security options shown in Figure 1. By default, at least
on Ubuntu systems, Swat displays only four options under this section
in its basic view, but that's a reasonable starting point.
</p><p>
The first of these is read only, which I leave at the Ubuntu default
of yes, even though I want the user account mick to be able to publish
new menus. (The setting write list, which I'll describe a little later in
this article
will override this setting.)
</p><p>
The second security setting shown in Figure 1 is guest ok, which I
change to yes. (My guests, and those of my boarders, certainly
will be keenly interested to know what side dishes will accompany Tuesday
night's Coconut Tater-Tot Casserole.)
</p><p>
I should pause here for a quick review of how guest access works in
Samba. Last month, when we configured Samba's global settings, we set the
option map to guest to Bad User, which caused Samba to treat clients
who log in with nonexistent user names as guests. We set the option
guest account to nobody, which means that when people log on as a
guest (either by providing a bad user name or by actually logging in as
nobody), they will be logged in under the account nobody.
</p><p>
None of these global settings has any effect on a given share unless
that share's guest ok option is set to yes. As we'll see shortly,
that doesn't actually give guests any <span   class="emphasis"><em>permissions</em></span> on that share
unless we do just a little more work.
</p><p>
First, there are two more security options to attend to in Figure
1: hosts allow and hosts deny can be used to define TCP Wrappers-like,
network-level access controls on your share. You can learn everything
you need to know about this from the hosts_access(5) man page.
</p><p>
In Figure 1, hosts allow will be set to 192.168.44., which means &ldquo;allow
access from clients whose source IP address' first three octets are
192.168.44&rdquo;. In our example scenario, this corresponds to my local LAN
address of 192.168.44.0/24. hosts deny is set to ALL, which means
&ldquo;deny access to all clients who do not match any value in hosts
allow.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In my opinion, there's no good reason not to use hosts allow and
hosts deny with Samba unless your LAN is very complicated. It's not as
important as making proper use of user and group accounts, enforcing the
use of strong passwords and other things you should be doing, but it's
nonetheless a useful layer in our defense onion.
</p><p>
At this point you may be wondering, how do we tell Samba who has write
access and who has read-only access for this share? The four security
options we've covered don't address that. The answer is, we've already
established some default settings for this in the global section,
and share-specific authorization controls can be set by switching from
basic to advanced view in Swat, by clicking the Advanced button near
the top of the screen.
When you do that, you'll see something like Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10292f2.large.jpg"><img src="10292f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Share Security Options in Advanced View
</p></div></div><p>
But wait, what's this? Where did those values for valid users, read
list and so forth come from, given my earlier sidebar note about these
screenshots showing default settings?
</p><p>
As it happens, many of Samba's options can be declared
<span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> as
global settings and as share-specific settings. When you set up a new
share, Swat copies the values of any such options you set up under the
global settings
to the new share. So, Figure 2 represents Swat's settings after I've
set up the global section but before I've fine-tuned the SUPPER share.
</p><p>
And, I do need to fine-tune it! On the one hand, invalid users is set
to root as in the corresponding global option, which is a good value
to propagate here; it's never a good idea to log in to much of anything
directly as root.
</p><p>
But because I want this to be a public share, I'm going to remove all the
users listed in valid users, which will have the effect of allowing
clients to log in using <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> user name they provide. (Remember,
though, anyone logging in with a user name outside the Samba user database
or /etc/password will be logged on as nobody&mdash;that is, as a guest.)
</p><p>
Similarly, I'm going to empty read list as well, as read only is
set to yes anyhow. (read list is sort of a blacklist: anyone whose
user name is listed here will be granted only read access to this share
regardless of <span   class="emphasis"><em>any other setting</em></span> in this share or under Globals.)
</p><p>
Another setting I'm going to empty is admin users. Like I said last
month, this is a dangerous setting, and it's usually unnecessary. (I really
shouldn't have set it to mick in the global section!) Not only will
admin users operate with full Linux root privileges, all files they
create will have a user owner of root, which can complicate both Samba
and Linux filesystem permissions. Most of the time you might be tempted
to set this option, it's probably sufficient instead simply to give that
user write access.
</p><p>
And, you can do that with the option write list. In this case, we can
leave the value of mick inherited from Globals.
</p><p>
The last security setting to change is create mask. This option
determines the UNIX permissions that will be given to any files moved
into or created in the share. Its value must be a chmod-style octal mode,
as described in the chmod(1) man page.
</p><p>
The default value 0744, shown in Figure 2, translates to &ldquo;owner
read+write+execute, group read, other read&rdquo;. However, because this share
is going to contain text files, there's no reason for the group-execute
bit to be set; 0644 (owner read+write, group read, other read) is a
better choice.
</p><p>
To review, and for clarity's sake, Figure 3 shows the changed settings
for these security options in Swat's advanced view.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10292f3.large.jpg"><img src="10292f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. New Share Security Settings
</p></div></div><p>
We're almost done configuring this share. There are just two more
options to check, and now you can switch back to basic view to find them
quickly. The Browse Option browseable is set to yes by default on
Ubuntu systems, which is appropriate for a public share.
</p><p>
The EventLog Option available, on the other hand, which is used to
enable or disable a share, has the rather sensible default value of
no. I say sensible, because it's never a good idea to activate anything
before you're finished configuring and securing it! But, we are in fact
done securing this share, so we'll change available to yes.
</p><p>
The last step is to click the Commit Changes button near the top of the
Swat page. On my system, any time I click this button, the view resets to
what appear to be default settings for printer shares! If this happens
on your system too, all you need to do is click the Choose Share
button again to display the changes you just committed.
</p><p>
After you create, delete or reconfigure a share, the changes will be
applied immediately to your running Samba d&aelig;mons; there's no need to
restart any of them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x27a8f70"></a>
Testing Samba Shares</h2></div></div><p>
Now that the SUPPER share is configured and available, it should start
showing up in the Network Neighborhood (or other Windows network
browser) of users connected to the LAN. Your Samba server, which we've
configured to be a Browse Master for its workgroup, achieves this by
sending out broadcasts.
</p><p>
However, in my experience, network browsers are often unreliable&mdash;it can take a while for your new workgroup, servers and shares to show
up, and sometimes things disappear for no apparent reason. (Even for
Windows clients, using the Map Network Drive feature to specify your
share's path is both faster and more reliable than using the Network
Neighborhood browser.)
</p><p>
So although you might get decent results testing your new share by simply
firing up a network browser, I recommend using Samba's command-line
tools instead, namely, smbclient and smbtree, which are included in
Debian and Ubuntu's smbclient package, and in Red Hat and SUSE's
samba-client package. I'll leave it to you to explore the smbtree(1)
and smbclient(1) man pages, but I will give you a couple usage examples.
</p><p>
smbtree is a text-based Windows network browser that sometimes performs
better than GUI-based browsers. To view all available workgroups, servers
and public shares on your local LAN, use this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbtree -N -b
</pre>
</p><p>
smbclient is a much more versatile command that can be used both to view
and use Samba shares. To use smbclient to connect to our new share as
the user nobody (guest), you can type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbclient //CASA_DE_MICK/SUPPER -U nobody
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the share-name syntax:
<tt  >//&lt;servername&gt;/&lt;sharename&gt;</tt>. You can
use an IP address instead of the actual server name; this can result
in a quicker login, because it allows smbclient to skip the 
name-resolution step. (Have I mentioned lately how inefficient the SMB/CIFS
protocol is?)
</p><p>
Note also that to test the Bad User (guest-failover) behavior I
described earlier, this command should be functionally equivalent to
the previous one:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ smbclient //CASA_DE_MICK/SUPPER -U totallyfakeusername
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll be prompted for a password. Simply press Enter without typing one (your
nobody account shouldn't have a password!). If everything is working,
you should see something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Anonymous login successful
Domain=[FED-CENTRAL] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.28a]
smb: \&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, you now have the Samba equivalent of an FTP shell&mdash;in fact, this environment is designed to be similar to FTP clients. To
see a list of all available commands, you can enter ? or
<tt  >help</tt>. For
now, we'll just do a quick directory by entering <tt  >dir</tt>:


<pre     class="programlisting">
smb: \&gt; dir
  .                            D     0  Tue Oct  7 13:22:28 2008

         52008 blocks of size 262144. 13782 blocks available
</pre>
</p><p>
I'll leave it to you to figure out how to test copying files in both
directions (<tt  >put</tt> should work only for the user mick, but everyone
else, including guests, should be able to list, get and read files).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b7580.0x27a97b0"></a>
Creating a Group-Readable File Share</h2></div></div><p>
On the strength of our SUPPER-creating experience, you'll find it fast
and easy to create the group-readable share CHORES (which will contain
lists of household tasks my boarders can perform in exchange for a
rent discount). This share will be very similar to SUPPER: mick will
have read and write access; pepe, skippy and knute will have read
access only. However, unlike SUPPER, guest access will not be permitted.
</p><p>
Accordingly, after typing a new share name (CHORES) into the Create
Share field and then clicking the Create Share button, we'll need to
be sure to leave guest ok set to its default value of no. We'll
set comment and path to Chore lists and /home/mick/chores,
respectively (having first created this directory in a terminal
window, and setting its ownership and permissions to be the same as
for /home/mick/supper).
</p><p>
hosts allow and hosts deny can be the same as for SUPPER. browseable
can be left at yes, but available should be left at no for now.
</p><p>
Figure 4 shows these settings (except available) for our new CHORES share.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10292f4.large.jpg"><img src="10292f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Basic View Settings (Customized) for CHORES
</p></div></div><p>
Now, we'll switch to Swat's advanced view for this share (if you aren't
there already) by clicking the Advanced button. As with SUPPER, we'll
blank out admin users, because we're paranoid, and also read users,
as read only already is set to yes.
</p><p>
As you can see in Figure 5, however, I'm employing a bit of useful
laziness in the valid users field for CHORES.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10292f5.large.jpg"><img src="10292f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Advanced Security Settings (Customized) for CHORES
</p></div></div><p>
In the valid users field in Figure 5, the + in front of users
instructs Samba to look up the name users in /etc/group, and then
replace this entire value with a list of all members of the group
users. Because on this server that group consists of mick, knute, pepe
and skippy, Samba ultimately will set the value of valid users to
mick, knute, pepe, skippy.
</p><p>
Needless to say, be careful with group names in this context.
Before using one in Swat (or directly in smb.conf), be sure you know
for certain exactly which user accounts belong to that group.
</p><p>
The quickest way to do this is to look up the group name in /etc/group
and note its numeric value, noting also any secondary group members
it has. Then, see which users in /etc/passwd have that group's number
listed as its primary group.
</p><p>
Here's how this looks when enumerating the group users on my Ubuntu
system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mick@ubuntu@:~$ grep users /etc/group

users:x:100:

mick@ubuntu:~$ grep :100: /etc/passwd

dhcp:x:100:101::/nonexistent:/bin/false
mick:x:1003:100:Mick Bauer:/home/mick:/bin/sh
knute:x:1004:100:Knute:/home/knute:/bin/sh
pepe:x:1005:100:Pepe:/home/pepe:/bin/sh
skippy:x:1006:100:Skippy:/home/skippy:/bin/sh
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, there are no secondary users listed at the end of the user's
entry in /etc/group. My second grep command turned up five users, not
the four I was expecting, but dhcp matched only because its numeric
user ID (not its group ID) is 100.
</p><p>
The other settings we should change are create mask, which we'll again
set to 0644, and then browseable, which we now can safely change to
yes. Finally, we can click the Commit Changes button, and CHORES is
ready to go. Preferably using another system, test it to make sure it
works the way you expect.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
That's all we've got space for this month. Next time, we'll create
that third, mick-only share (I'll bet you can figure that out yourself
beforehand), create persistent Samba mounts on our client systems using
smbmount and at least briefly address some miscellaneous Samba security
topics, such as how to make Samba automatically and safely serve people's
home directories.
Until then, be safe!
