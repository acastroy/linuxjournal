Did you know that RAM doesn't clear the moment it loses power? That it can
persist for up to a few minutes if chilled? Learn about attack techniques
that take advantage of these facts to uncover encryption keys and break disk
encryption.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x2612300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you have used a computer for any reasonable length of time,
you've learned about the difference between RAM storage and hard drive
storage. Besides the fact that RAM is faster than hard drive storage,
we also typically think that anything stored in RAM lasts only until
the computer loses power, while data stored on a hard drive persists even
when the computer is unplugged. Anyone who has lost power while working
on a school assignment can attest to the temporary nature of RAM storage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x26124b8"></a>
The Cold Boot Attack</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out that what we have learned about RAM isn't entirely
true. On February 21, 2008, a paper titled &ldquo;Lest We Remember: Cold
Boot Attacks on Encryption Keys&rdquo; was released. In this paper, the
researchers describe their discoveries about RAM persistence and how
they can be exploited. The researchers found that RAM isn't
automatically erased when it no longer has power. Instead, RAM degrades
over time, and even after a few seconds without power, you still
can recover a significant amount of data. They also found that if you chill
the RAM first, using liquid nitrogen or even a can of compressed air
turned upside down, you can preserve the RAM state for more than 30 seconds
up to minutes at a time&mdash;more than enough time to remove the
RAM physically from a machine and place it in another computer.
</p><p>
By itself, although this discovery is surprising, what's most interesting
are some of the implications if RAM contents can survive a reboot. It
turns out that a number of common disk encryption tools for Windows, Mac
and even Linux all store encryption keys in RAM. With this cold boot
attack, if people lock their screens or even suspend their laptops,
you could pull the power, grab the RAM contents and scrub it for any
encryption keys. Essentially, you could compromise all of the common disk
encryption techniques if you had a few minutes alone with a
computer.
</p><p>
When I heard of this discovery, the first thing that came to my mind
wasn't encryption, but forensics. I've written previously about forensics
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> [see &ldquo;Introduction to
Forensics&rdquo; in the January 2008 issue], and in that article, I discuss the debate over how to
respond initially when your server has been hacked. One school of thought
favors instantly pulling the power on a compromised server. The idea is
that you want to freeze the filesystem in place and don't want to risk
that the attacker, or even the investigators for that matter, will destroy
evidence. The other school of thought believes that pulling the power
would destroy a lot of valuable data that exists only in RAM, so one
should gather data from RAM first and then pull the power. With this
cold boot attack, now you don't have to make that choice. If a server
has been compromised, you can pull power first, and then reboot
and grab the contents of RAM.

Cold Boot Attack Tools Released</h2></div></div><p>
In the paper, the researchers not only outlined the cold boot attack,
they also described tools they had created to take advantage of
this flaw. On July 16, 2008, the complete source code for these tools
was released to the public at <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/code" target="_self">citp.princeton.edu/memory/code</a>. In
true UNIX style, each of the tools are small and single-purpose:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
RAM imaging tools:
the first set of tools enables you to image a system's RAM. Although you
potentially could boot off a rescue disk like Knoppix and then copy
the memory, the rescue disk itself will overwrite a substantial amount of
RAM. With the provided tools, you have a small executable that you can boot
either from a USB disk or over the network via PXE. The USB executable
dumps the entire contents of RAM to the USB disk and then powers off
or reboots the host. The attacker then can take the USB disk to another
computer and use a corresponding tool to dump the memory from the disk
into a file. The PXE executable sets up the target for remote control,
so the attacker then can dump the RAM over the network to the PXE server.
</p></li><li><p>
Key-scanning tools:
the second set of tools on the site can scan the RAM image you
have created for encryption keys. The names of the tools are pretty
self-explanatory. The aeskeyfind tool searches for AES keys, and the
rsakeyfind tool searches for RSA keys.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x2612ae8"></a>
Download and Build the Cold Boot Attack Tools</h2></div></div><p>
Since the source for all of these tools was released, you can
download and use them yourself without too much setup. First, go to
<a href="http://citp.princeton.edu/memory/code" target="_self">citp.princeton.edu/memory/code</a>, and download the latest version
of the bios_memimage tarball, or the efi_netboot tarball if you want
to image a machine that boots with EFI. Then, unpack the tarball. For my
examples in this article, I use the bios_memimage package.
</p><p>
The bios_memimage package contains a doc directory with good documentation
on the project and how to build and use the source. The tools support both
32- and 64-bit environments. Although the 32-bit version technically
will work on a 64-bit system, it can't address all the 64-bit environment's
memory space, so you might not get a complete image. To build for a 32-bit
environment, enter the bios_memimage directory and type
<tt  >make</tt>. To build
for a 64-bit environment, enter the bios_memimage directory and type
<tt  >make
-f Makefile.64</tt>.
</p><p>

Note: I noticed when I compiled the code on my environment, the build
errored out with an undefined reference to __stack_chk_fail. This is due
to GCC's new stack protection. As a workaround, edit the pxe/Makefile
file and change the line that reads:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CFLAGS= -ffreestanding -Os -Wall -I../include -march=i386
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x2612e58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CFLAGS= -ffreestanding -Os -Wall -I../include 
 &#8618;-march=i386 -fno-stack-protector
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x2612fb8"></a>
USB-Based Cold Boot Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
Once the code has compiled successfully, you are ready to install the
tools. The procedure is different for the USB and PXE tools. For the
USB tool, you need a USB drive that you are willing to erase and that
is big enough to fit the RAM you want to dump. In the usb directory is a
bootable image called scraper.bin. Connect your USB disk (in my example,
/dev/sdb), and then use the dd tool as root to overwrite the beginning
of the drive with the boot image:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dd if=scraper.bin of=/dev/sdb 
19+1 records in
19+1 records out
9792 bytes (9.8 kB) copied, 0.0101028 s, 969 kB/s
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the disk is ready. Go to the machine you would like to image, connect
the USB drive, and then force a CPU reset or pull and then restore the
power quickly. Then, set the BIOS to boot from the USB key. This will vary
depending on the computer. On some BIOSes, you will press F12 or some other
key to see a list of boot options; others require you to enter the
BIOS configuration to change the boot order. In any case, once you boot
from the USB key, the scraper tool immediately will start dumping the
contents of RAM to the disk. Once it has completed, it will attempt an
APM power-off or otherwise will reset the machine. Then you can unplug
the USB drive and return to your machine.
</p><p>
You can use the provided usbdump tool under the directory of the same
name to dump the RAM from the USB disk to your local drive. Simply
specify the USB drive as an argument and then redirect the output to a
file of your choice:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./usbdump /dev/sdb &gt; memdump.img
recover segment0 [base: 0x0 size: 653312]
recover segment1 [base: 0x100000 size: 1062993920]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x2613220"></a>
PXE-Based Cold Boot Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
The PXE-based scraper works somewhat differently from the USB-based
scraper. First, if you don't already have a PXE server, you need
to configure one. That process is out of the scope of this article, but
I explained how to set up a PXE server in the article
&ldquo;PXE Magic&rdquo; in the April 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. Once you have a
functional PXE server, copy the pxe/scraper binary to your tftp directory
and change your pxelinux configuration so that it points to that file.
</p><p>
Next, connect the target system to the network (or if you set up the
PXE server on a laptop, just connect the target system to the laptop
via a crossover cable). Then, initiate a CPU reset or power off, and then
immediately power on the target system. As with USB booting, different
BIOSes have different ways to boot from PXE. On some BIOSes, you can press
a function key, and others require that you change the boot order from
the BIOS configuration.
</p><p>
Once the target machine gets a DHCP address and boots from the network,
it will display a status message and then wait for the pxedump utility
to connect. Unlike with the USB-based scraper, the PXE scraper doesn't
automatically dump the memory over the network. Instead, you need to
execute the pxedump binary found under the pxedump directory as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./pxedump target_machine_IP_address &gt; memdump.img
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x251a580.0x26134e0"></a>
Scan the Memory Dump</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have a dump from the target system's RAM, what can you do with
it? Well, one of the primary things you can do is to scan the image for
encryption keys. On the same page as the bios_memimage package, you will
find tarballs for aeskeyfind and rsakeyfind utilities. To use these
utilities, simply extract the source from the tarball and then run
<tt  >make</tt>
within the source directory. Each source tree includes a README file
that describes options with these utilities, but for basic scanning, just
execute the aeskeyfind or rsakeyfind binary with the path to the memory
dump as an argument. The tools will output any keys they find.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of other publicly available tools out
yet that can reconstruct other useful information from a memory dump;
however, you always can use the strings utility and grep to scan the
image for keywords:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ strings memdump.img | grep keyword
</pre>

Cold Boot Attack Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
This attack can be very effective, particularly against laptops. That
being said, there are a number of limitations to this attack. For
one, the machine you attack must be powered on, suspended or hibernated,
because the RAM will start to degrade once the machine is powered
off. Second, some BIOSes and all systems with ECC RAM will scrub the RAM
before it boots an OS. In those cases, you either would have to attempt
to disable this scrubbing or chill the RAM and move it to a system that
doesn't do any scrubbing.
