How to add one-time passwords to your own system for added
security without investing in an expensive authentication
infrastructure.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b42a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A number of factors inspired me to take a closer look at
the Yubikey. For starters, it is such a simple and elegant solution to
two of the major problems the security industry is facing these days:
authentication and identity management. Furthermore, I really like how
Yubico, the manufacturer of Yubikey, is trying to integrate the Open
Source movement into its business strategy. In this article, I 
cover three topics related to this little device. First, I 
explain what the Yubikey does and how to use it. Second, I 
examine how it works. Third, I show how to integrate the
Yubikey authentication service into your own infrastructure without too
much trouble.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b4460"></a>
What Is It?</h2></div></div><p>
A Yubikey is a small plastic rectangle that basically consists of a
USB connector and a button. It resembles a tiny USB Flash drive, and
as it measures only 18x45x2mm and weighs only 2 grams, it 
easily can be carried on a keychain or in a wallet (Figures 1 and 2).
When you plug it in to your machine's USB port,
it identifies itself as a keyboard, implying that the Yubikey is
platform-independent as long as the host device supports data entry via
the USB Human Interface Device (HID) specifications. It draws power
from the host device and, thus, does not have to depend on an internal
battery. The whole device is quite compact and can be attached to
an actual key ring using the small hole near the top of the device. The
gold surface connectors are quite robust and are expected to last the
lifetime of the device. According to a Yubico representative, Yubikeys
still were usable after running them through a washing machine's cycle.

Figure 2. Yubikey Size
</p></div></div><p>
Each time you press the button on the device, it generates a one-time
password and sends it to the host machine as if you had entered it on a
keyboard. This password then can be used by the service to authenticate
you as a user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b4930"></a>
How Do You Use It?</h2></div></div><p>
I use RoundCube to read my e-mail when I don't have access
to my own system. RoundCube is an AJAX-centric Web-based e-mail client.
You use it via your Web browser just as you might use Gmail or most other
major on-line e-mail providers. Fortunately, RoundCube is open source
and based on PHP, so it didn't take too much
work to add Yubikey authentication.
</p><p>
Normally, RoundCube asks you to enter your e-mail address and password
to log in. However, following a few modifications, the login screen now
features a third field: Yubikey OTP (one-time
password). Now, all you have to do is enter your e-mail and password as
usual, position the cursor in the newly added text field, and put your
finger on the Yubikey's button. After a second or so, the Yubikey
magically spits out a 44-character sequence followed by a newline
character. The newline character causes the form to be submitted. And,
assuming that your Yubikey is indeed associated with your account, you
will be logged in. Take a look at Figure 3, which shows the slightly
modified login screen.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10166f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Modified RoundCube Login Form UI
</p></div></div><p>
For obvious reasons, the Yubikey should not be used as the only method
of authentication. If that were the case, someone getting a hold of
your Yubikey then would be able to access your Yubikey-enabled accounts
provided that person also knows your corresponding login. However, if you use
the Yubikey to add another attribute to a multi-attribute authentication
scheme, it can increase security significantly. Imagine if you will,
people monitoring your network traffic without your consent. They may be
able to glean your password by examining captured TCP packets, but the
Yubikey password they capture will be of no use to them, because it can
be used only once! After you use a Yubikey password to log in somewhere,
it becomes useless. In the next section, I explain exactly
how this one-time password scheme works.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b4cf8"></a>
More Details</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a closer look at the character sequence the Yubikey transmits
to the host machine. Here's an example of a sequence generated by
my Yubikey:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tlerefhcvijlngibueiiuhkeibbcbecehvjiklltnbbl
</pre>
</p><p>
The above is actually a one-time password that is secured
using AES-128 encryption and ModHex encoding. Let's take a look at how
the Yubikey constructs this string. For the purpose of this discussion,
refer to Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10166f4.large.jpg"><img src="10166f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Yubikey Token Construction
</p></div></div><p>
The device starts by creating a 16-byte sequence (Figure 4) where
the individual bytes are allocated as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The first six bytes hold the key's secret unique ID, which is assigned when
a Yubikey is programmed. This ID is known only to the entity that assigned
it and cannot be retrieved from the Yubikey. Six bytes translates into
2<sup  >(6*8)</sup> = 281,474,976,710,656 unique combinations of bits, which is the
number of Yubikey IDs that can be issued before Yubico has to think of a
new scheme. Considering that this number exceeds the current world population
by a factor of more than 42,000, Yubico is not likely to run out of
unique IDs for some time, unless its business model is more successful
than anyone could anticipate.
</p></li><li><p>
The next two bytes in our sequence, bytes 7 and 8, are used to store a
session counter in nonvolatile memory. The counter starts at zero and
is incremented each time the device is plugged in. Two bytes for the
session counter allows for 2<sup  >(2*8)</sup> = 65,536
sessions. In other words,
you can plug in the Yubikey three times a day for almost 60 years
before running out of session counters. Note that you can generate a
significant number of OTPs during each session (see below).
</p></li><li><p>
The following three bytes, bytes 9 through 11, are used as a timestamp,
which is stored in volatile memory during each session. That means
each time the device is plugged in, the timestamp starts at zero
and continuously increases. Because it is incremented by an internal 8Hz
clock, timestamp values will be exhausted after about 24 days. At that
time, you need to unplug the Yubikey and plug it back in.
</p></li><li><p>
Byte 12 in the sequence is a session counter that starts at zero and is
incremented by one each time a token is generated. When it reaches that
maximum value of 255, it wraps back to zero.
</p></li><li><p>
Bytes 13 and 14 in the sequence are pseudo-random numbers provided by a
free-running oscillator. These bytes are used to add additional
entropy to the plain text before subjecting it to the cypher.
</p></li><li><p>
The last two bytes, numbers 15 and 16, contain a checksum using the
CRC-16 algorithm over all values of the token with the two checksum
bytes set to zero. This checksum is used for data-integrity checking.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Each time the Yubikey is invoked, it generates the 16-byte sequence
described above. However, if you look at the sample Yubikey output
previously listed in this article, you will notice that it actually
consists of 44 characters. That is because we still are missing
three crucial steps before the Yubikey is ready to spit out the final
token. First, the 16-byte token is encrypted using an AES-128 key that
is unique to each Yubikey. Second, the Yubikey prepends the encrypted
16-byte token with a six-byte plain-text public ID. This public ID is
completely different from the secret ID used to construct the 16-byte
sequence. The public key does not change and can be used to associate
a Yubikey token with an account. Finally, the whole 22-byte sequence
(16 bytes encrypted plus six bytes public ID) will be encoded using the
not-so-well-known ModHex algorithm.
</p><p>
Yubico chose this algorithm simply because it is limited to characters
that are common to many different keyboard layouts. Because the Yubikey
impersonates a keyboard, it tries to use characters that work with the various
keyboard settings it might encounter in the wild. The disadvantage is that
ModHex encoding is somewhat inefficient in that it requires two characters
for each byte it encodes, which is why a 22-byte sequence turns into a
44-character sequence. However, as the Yubikey does all the typing, this
does not translate into an inconvenience for users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b56f0"></a>
More about Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a closer look at the encryption step of generating the token. In
contrast to asymmetric algorithms used in public-key encryption schemes,
such as PGP, AES is a symmetric algorithm. This means both the party
encrypting the token and the party decrypting and validating it will
need access to the AES-128 key! This sharing of the AES key happens when
the device is programmed. Similar to the device's unique ID, the unique
AES-128 key is generated and stored on the device by Yubico before
it is shipped out. The company maintains a database where the unique
public as well as secret IDs are associated with their corresponding
AES keys. This way, Yubico is able to offer an authentication Web service.
</p><p>
Using a symmetric algorithm has the advantage that it is typically very
fast. Also, you don't need to rely on third parties for key management
or to vouch for identities.
</p><p>
If you want to be in charge of your own AES key, you have two
options. First, you can request your AES key from Yubico. At the time of this
writing, Yubico will send you a CD containing the AES key, but the company
also is working on a more convenient solution of retrieving the key
on-line. Second, you can use Yubico's development kit to program the key yourself. This way, you can assign
AES-128 keys, as well as public and secret IDs, according to your own
naming conventions. If you supplement this approach by running your own
authentication Web service, you eliminate any dependence on Yubico as
a third party in your authentication procedure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b58a8"></a>
The Validation Algorithm: Order Matters</h2></div></div><p>
It's not surprising that the process of validating an OTP resembles reversing
the steps necessary for constructing an OTP. A basic validation routine might
look something like this. First, you ModHex decode the string. Next, you
split the string into public ID and 16-byte token. Then, you use the public ID
to look up the corresponding AES key. After using the AES key to decrypt,
you have the original 16-byte token in plain text. Next, you would verify
the CRC-16 checksum (the last two bytes). Then, you would compare the secret ID
to the one you retrieved from the database using the public ID. Using
the session counter and the session token counter, make sure that the
current token was generated after the last successfully authenticated
token. Although you don't know exactly when any two tokens were generated,
you always can tell in which order they were generated. If the token
passes all these tests, you can send a response signaling successful
validation to the client. Otherwise, the token is rejected.
</p><p>
Optionally, you can harden the validation algorithm further. For example,
you can try to calculate how many sessions or tokens have been skipped
since the last successful validation and consider that information in
your decision to validate or reject the token. You can use the session
timestamp in a similar manner.

Yubico's Open-Source Approach</h2></div></div><p>
One thing I find really attractive about Yubico's business model is that
it tries to provide all software in the form of open source. According to
Yubico's statements, it plans to profit from the manufacture and sale of
the devices, but intends to keep all software open source. For example,
the source code for the aforementioned Web service is freely available
as a reference implementation. Furthermore, Yubico offers client libraries
needed for implementing Yubikey authentication in various applications
and platforms. Currently, there are client libraries available in Java,
C, C#/.NET, PAM, PHP, Ruby, Perl and Python. All these libraries and
programs are set up as Google Code projects. Additionally, there are
projects for libraries to decrypt OTPs in C and Java, as well as
an Open ID server and a personalization tool to allow you to program
your own Yubikey. Although all these software projects were initiated
by Yubico, you already can see others contributing. Moreover, a number
of independent open-source projects using the Yubikey technology have
surfaced. Yubico's discussion forum is a good place to keep tabs on
such projects and get support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25bc580.0x26b5b68"></a>
The Yubico Authentication Service</h2></div></div><p>
When you order a Yubikey, it comes ready to take advantage of Yubico's
authentication Web service. Because Yubico maintains a database of all API
keys, as well as public and secret IDs with which the Yubikeys have been
programmed before shipment, Yubico has decided to offer an authentication
Web service against those credentials. Developers then can use the
Yubico authentication Web service to validate OTPs captured from the
device. Yubico has a Web page where you can request an API key. Anyone
can get an API key. The only requirement is that you have to submit
a valid Yubikey OTP. This is merely a measure to avoid database bloat
from too many bogus requests. The API key also comes with an ID number.
</p><p>
The purpose of the API key is to sign/verify requests to/from the Yubico
authentication Web service using the HMAC-SHA1 hashing algorithm. This is
done because support for SSL is often spurious in the various environments
in which the Web service client libraries have to function. Note that
it is not strictly necessary to use SSL, because the token already
is encrypted! However, as an added precaution, SSL should be used as a
transport layer whenever it is available. In the PHP client library,
for example, all you have to do is add an s to http where the
authentication server URL is specified.

Adding Yubikey Authentication to Typo</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have a solid understanding of the underlying technology,
let's add Yubikey authentication to an existing application. I use
Typo to blog. Typo is developed using Ruby on Rails, and you can 
check out its latest codebase via the project's public Subversion
repository. Whether or not you like the structure RoR imposes on the
developer, it works to our advantage in this case, because it makes it
easy to locate the files we need to modify. Take a look at Figure 5
for a basic outline of the validation routine we will be implementing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10166f5.large.jpg"><img src="10166f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Yubikey OTP Validation Flow
</p></div></div><p>
To start, let's drop the Ruby Web services client library, yubico.rb,
into the project's lib directory. After adding the corresponding
require command to the config/environments.rb file, we can be assured
that the library will be available throughout the application.
</p><p>
Two groups of settings are necessary to configure Yubikey authentication.
First, there are the site-wide settings, namely the API
key and corresponding ID necessary to submit authentication requests to
the Web service. There also is a switch for enabling or disabling Yubikey
authentication on a blog-wide level. Typo stores these blog-specific
settings by serializing them and persisting them to the blogs.settings
column. Lucky for us, that means we don't have to make any changes to
the database. However, we do need to amend the UI and data model used to
store these settings within the application. Listing 1 shows how to add
these three Yubikey configuration options to the respective HTML template
in the admin user interface. Similarly, Listing 2 shows how to add those
same settings to the model. That's all it takes for Rails to render a form
to input those settings and store them in the database for each blog. 
Figure 6 shows the final result.

Second, there are two user-specific settings: Yubikey ID and Yubikey
Required. The former is necessary to associate a Typo account with a
user's unique public Yubikey ID; whereas the latter allows users to
enable Yubikey authentication selectively for their accounts only. Now,
let's
make both options available from the user's preference settings within
the application's admin interface. To make the new options appear in
the UI, I added a new section to the partial HTML template that renders
the form for editing user options (Listing 3). Thanks to RoR's
ActiveRecord support, we don't need to write any code to save these
new options to the database; however, we do need to make sure that we
add the correspondingly named fields to the user table to which all
values on this screen are being persisted. In Rails, this is done by
adding a database migration, which is nothing more than an abstract way
of describing an incremental modification to the database. In our case,
we are adding the fields yubikey_id and yubikey_required to the
user table by creating the migration shown in Listing 4. Now, all you need
to do is run the rake utility from the command line and tell it to
upgrade the database: <tt  >rake db:migrate</tt>. The nice thing about Rails'
migrations is that they are database-provider independent. The migration we
created in Listing 4 can be used with any of the underlying databases
that Typo supports. At the time of this writing, this includes MySQL,
PostgreSQL and SQLite. Finally, you can admire the new settings in the
account-specific options in Figure 7.

Now that we have the setup all taken care of, we can focus on the actual
authentication during login. First, let's add a Yubikey OTP input field
to the login screen provided that Yubikey authentication is enabled for
the whole blog. I have done this by modifying the partial template that
renders the login form in Listing 5. Notice that we always have to show
the Yubikey OTP field during login, because until users supply their
user names, we don't know whether Yubikey authentication is required for
a particular user. Figure 8 shows the modified login screen. 
</p><p>
When
the login form is submitted, Rails routes it to the login method of
the AccountsController class (Listing 6). This is where we add the
logic to check whether we need to handle Yubikey authentication. After
the existing code has verified the regular login and password, we
now have an instantiated user object that can tell us whether Yubikey
authentication is required for this user. If so, we invoke the static
method authenticate_yubikey of the user object. Looking at Listing
7, we check that neither the Yubikey OTP from the login form nor the
user's public Yubikey ID are blank. Moreover, by definition, the first
12 characters of the OTP have to match the public ID associated with
the account. If everything is in order, we instantiate a Yubico object,
which will handle the Web service authentication request for us. The
method simply returns a boolean. True means the user was authenticated
successfully. Conversely, false implies an invalid OTP or an attempt by
an unauthorized user&mdash;possibly an attempt to hack into the account.

That's it! My Typo blog is now Yubikey-enabled. I will be submitting a
patch to make these changes permanent by integrating them into the
Typo codebase.

Implementation Variations</h2></div></div><p>
You might want to consider a few variations when
implementing Yubikey authentication. First, you can choose to omit the
user name, because the Yubikey token already includes a public ID that
can be used to link to the user's account. This scheme works as long as
you are not allowing users to associate a single Yubikey with multiple
accounts.
</p><p>
Second, you can minimize modifications required to the UI of existing
systems by including the Yubikey token in the password field. Because
the OTP is of fixed length, it stands to reason that the remaining
characters belong to the password. Also, as the Yubikey appends a
newline character to the token, users would have to type their password
first, followed by the OTP&mdash;rather than the other way around.
</p><p>
Third, you might want to consider making login a two-step process. First,
prompt the user for the OTP and validate it. If the validation request
is approved, prompt the user for the regular login and password. To see
the advantage of this approach, consider the scenario in which user
name, password and OTP are submitted simultaneously. If malicious
parties are able to intercept the submission and prevent the OTP from being
submitted to the validation server, they effectively have all three pieces
of information they need to penetrate the system to which you are trying
to authenticate. However, if you submit the OTP only during the first stop
of the login process, malicious parties can intercept the token without
gaining access to the system because they do not have the corresponding
user name and password. To make you supply the user name and password,
they need to let the OTP pass through and be validated, which also makes
the OTP useless for subsequent uses. Thus, the attackers' task will be
complicated significantly.

Yubikey in the Wild</h2></div></div><p>
On its Web site, Yubico maintains a growing list of applications and
services that take advantage of the Yubikey. There is a plugin for
WordPress, SSH integration, phpBB forum access and Windows login
(commercial beta). As the above example of integrating the Yubikey into
the Typo blog software's authentication routine shows, the process is
fairly straightforward. Hopefully, this article inspires you to use this
as a starting point to make your favorite piece of open-source software
more secure by adding Yubikey authentication.
