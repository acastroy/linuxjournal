The MinorFs user-space filesystems works with AppArmor to provide a flexible
form of discretionary access control.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde6250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
MinorFs is a set of cooperating user-space filesystems that work with
AppArmor to provide a flexible form of discretionary access control that
operates at the process level. This type of process-level authority
restriction is roughly equivalent to that seen in object-oriented
programming, providing least-authority restrictions by parameter passing
without requiring the administrative overhead of policy controls seen
in mechanisms like SELinux. Least authority also is known as
least privilege or POLA (Principle Of Least Authority).
</p><p>
In Linux, access to filesystem data is managed by two different
access-control mechanisms. First, there is the basic and familiar UNIX
discretionary access-control system. The DoD document
&ldquo;Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria&rdquo; (aka the
&ldquo;Orange Book&rdquo;)
defines discretionary access control as &ldquo;a means of restricting
access
to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which
they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject
with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission
(perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject (unless restrained by
mandatory access control)&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Linux also provides access control through the Linux Security Module
(LSM) interface. LSM provides hooks for additional access-control
mechanisms, such as mandatory access controls, while leaving the base
UNIX discretionary access-control mechanisms untouched. The Orange
Book defines mandatory access controls as &ldquo;a means of restricting
access to objects based on the sensitivity (as represented by a label)
of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization
(i.e., clearance) of subjects to access information of such
sensitivity&rdquo;.
</p><p>
These two constructs are combined restrictively, which means if
either one denies access, access is denied. Well known users of
the LSM interface are Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux), used in Debian
and Red Hat, and AppArmor used in SUSE and Ubuntu.
</p><p>
Although the UNIX discretionary access control for filesystem access has
remained at the same (simple user level) granularity for decades,
mandatory access control has become more fine-grained (process
level). This granularity, however, comes at relatively large administrative
costs. SELinux, for example, is known among many administrators for
the large amount of overhead that comes with maintaining
profiles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde66c8"></a>
Object Orientation Provides the Model</h2></div></div><p>
When designing and writing object-oriented (OO) programs, avoiding
global variables, using data hiding, passing references between objects
and using established design patterns (like proxies and factories) are
concepts we are used to and comfortable with, and
most of us have come to appreciate the many advantages these
techniques offer. What many of us fail to realize when working
with these concepts, however, is the fact that part of what we are doing
can be
considered access control.
</p><p>
If we look at the OO paradigms from an access-control viewpoint, it is
easy to see that the model used by OO programs is both discretionary
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
suitable for the highest granularity. Therefore, you could say that OO
programs internally use an extremely fine-grained form of discretionary
access control. We must note, however, that this form of access control is
actually older than the whole concept of object-oriented programming. The
access-control mechanism used implicitly by OO programmers is, in fact,
to a large extent equivalent to the access-control mechanisms in use in
so-called capability-based systems. Capabilities, often called keys,
are an unforgeable authority token that can be passed between programs.
In capability-based systems, having a capability gives you the right
to use the referenced object within the boundaries specified by
the rights associated with the capability. With capabilities, there is
no need to check other access-control mechanisms (for example, ACLs); the
capability itself contains all the necessary information.
</p><p>
So, why not use this same form of discretionary access control at a
slightly coarser level of granularity for access to files and directories
by processes? MinorFs aims to do just that, with a lot of help from
AppArmor.
</p><p>
First, let's look at how classes, objects and member data, as used in
OO design and programming, compare to programs, processes and filesystem
data. There are clear indications that we could be dealing with the same
set of abstractions at a different granularity level.
</p><p>
You could look at a program the same way you look at a class. A process
is an instance of a program (the disk image), the same way that an object
is an instance of a class. Most objects have state, in the same way that
most processes have state. You could say the same abstractions are
there both at the object level of granularity and at the process level
of granularity.
</p><p>
Next, we need to map the persistent on-disk directory structures to the
same OO model that we just used to model programs and processes.
A couple hurdles need to be overcome to accomplish this.
First, there is process persistence, which is to say that processes are
&ldquo;not&rdquo; persistent, so how do they fit the model?
</p><p>
Second, there is pass by reference. If an object wants to share part
of its private state with another object that it knows, the object can
pass either a copy of or a reference to a part of its internal state.
Processes, however, to a great extent are confined to passing copies,
not references.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde6ae8"></a>
Process Persistence</h2></div></div><p>
Programs are persistent; directories and files are persistent, but
processes are not. This mismatch makes it impossible to add any
persistent on-disk data storage to a process identified by a process
ID, because when the process ends, the process ID is no longer valid.
The base solution to allowing the OO-like abstractions at the
process level of granularity for persistent on-disk storage is to
define processes as an incarnation of a so-called pseudo-persistent
process. So now, the program still will be equivalent to the class;
the pseudo-persistent process is the persistent equivalent to the object,
and the on-disk persistent directories and files are equivalent to
member data fields. Using this new concept of a pseudo-persistent
process gives us the ability to lift the disk data access-control
features of AppArmor to a granularity level beyond what is possible
with mandatory access control&mdash;that is, to the granularity of the
pseudo-persistent process, but we don't have the burden of central or human
administration, without the administrative overhead that mandatory
access control embodies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde6bf0"></a>
Pass by Reference</h2></div></div><p>
Where objects in OO languages can pass by reference, most IPC on Linux
does not allow pass by reference between processes. One insightful
exception to this that early UNIX engineers made was creating the
ability of passing file handles over UNIX sockets. You could say that file
handles used like this are fully pass by reference. In capability systems,
such a reference is called a protected capability or an object capability.
</p><p>
Currently, directory file handles cannot be used as protected
capabilities. To overcome this problem, there is a concept from
capability-system history that is quite useful. The concept is to use a
sparse key
string as representation of the reference. That is, we create a relatively
long sparse key string that both designates a resource and authorizes
access to the resource. This string is called a sparse capability or
unprotected capability. This type of capability is somewhat inferior
to the protected type of which the UNIX file handle is an example. When
combined with protection by AppArmor, it still has many properties that
make its usage roughly equivalent to the usage of references in
object-oriented languages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde6d50"></a>
AppArmor</h2></div></div><p>
AppArmor is the purely permissive mandatory access-control system used in
SUSE and Ubuntu Linux. MinorFs uses AppArmor as its foundation, and in this
way, it extends AppArmor so it can be used in a discretionary, even
capability-based manner. Although MinorFs might be used separately from
AppArmor,
its usability is relatively limited. The main reason for MinorFs' limited
usability without AppArmor is that by default,
processes can access data (like the environment variables or command-line
arguments) of other processes by way of the /proc/$PID directories, which
(according to MinorFs' philosophy) should be considered private to the
process.
</p><p>
This means without AppArmor, processes will, in some cases, be able
to steal each other's capabilities through the proc filesystem.
Although AppArmor fixes the vulnerabilities posed by the default proc
filesystem access rights, MinorFs extends AppArmor. The access-control
mechanism provided by MinorFs extends the static least-privilege approach
that AppArmor offers with a dynamic least-authority approach. That is,
it adds abilities to delegate decomposed and/or attenuated
permissions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde6f08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Delegation</b></p><p>
One of the most important differences between SELinux and
AppArmor is that SELinux is label-based while AppArmor is path-based. There
are two heavily discussed issues with path-based security: one is temporary
files (that could be solved by using the MinorViewFs temp provisions), and
the second is hard links. The perceived hard link problem is that one
entity
with access to a file could create a hard link that would delegate access
to
this file. There are many legitimate uses of delegation, and for this
reason,
advocates of capability-based security advise always to allow delegation.
To use delegation effectively, delegate only least authority. In
this context, least authority means always delegating the smallest and,
if possible, most attenuated subgraph that still could get the job done.
</p></div><p>
The prime property of capability-based security that AppArmor helps us
enforce is that processes should not have access to what would be
equivalent to global variables. The temp and home directories in UNIX
systems in many ways can be considered global variables if we look at
them at the process level of granularity.
</p><p>
The way an AppArmor profile works is that it defines a list of permissions
that are available for a specific application. For convenience, AppArmor
also provides the ability to include sets of permissions with a
single include directive.
</p><p>
When designing a system that will use MinorFs, you always 
should design your separation of privileges setup first. Don't allow your
application
to become a monolith.
</p><p>
Using AppArmor and MinorFs, you can build privilege-separated
applications according to OO or capability paradigms, but even smaller
steps can be quite useful. On installation, MinorFs creates a hard link
to /bin/bash named /bin/minorbash that has the following AppArmor profile:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;tunables/global&gt;

/bin/minorbash {
   #include &lt;abstractions/base&gt;
   #include &lt;abstractions/bash&gt;
   #include &lt;minorfs/systemreadonly&gt;
   #include &lt;minorfs/full&gt;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This profile basically gives a large set of read-only permissions but
no write permissions to the version of bash named minorbash and to all
programs started by it. This means, you simply can run programs with
diminished access rights by starting them from a shell script that uses
minorbash instead of bash.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde7380"></a>
MinorFs</h2></div></div><p>
Now, for MinorFs itself. MinorFs currently consists of two user-space
filesystems. These filesystems are relatively simple Perl scripts
implemented
using the FUSE Perl module. Each filesystem has its own distinct task.
FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) is a kernel module that allows
nonprivileged users to create their own filesystems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde7488"></a>
MinorCapFs</h2></div></div><p>
MinorCapFs is at the core of MinorFs. Some time ago, the Linux
directory and file-access API was extended with a set of new
calls&mdash;openat(), mkdirat() and so on&mdash;that take an additional
first argument,
a file descriptor, which specifies from where relative paths should
be resolved (these calls are to be standardized in a future
version of POSIX). Given the fact that file handles
in Linux can be communicated between processes and used as capabilities,
it seemed like a good idea to look at the new directory handle calls
and create or extend an LSM module so that directory handles could be
passed as directory capabilities. The main goal was to use a directory
handle as a capability to a directory that wouldn't disclose anything
about parent directories.
</p><p>
After discussing my ideas with the AppArmor people, it was concluded
that I should try to do as much as possible in user space, so I
started designing MinorCapFs. The goals of MinorCapFs are to
allow (unattenuated) decomposition, delegation and composition of
subgraphs. MinorFs defines a sparse capability for each directory tree
subgraph.
</p><p>
In order for you or your program to decompose the directory graph,
each file and directory is given an extended attribute named cap. This
extended attribute holds the full MinorCapFs path containing the sparse
capability for the directory subgraph. Using any form of interprocess
communication at your disposal, this path can be shared with any process
or even with other users on the same system. The receiving user or process
can create a symbolic link in another directory subgraph&mdash;for example,
in order to make the delegation permanent.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows how you could use the attr command to fetch the cap
attribute, and how this attribute can be used as a short strong path or
sparse capability to a directory or file. Normally, you should not use the
command line for this but instead do the same thing from your program
code. The getxattr function can be used to do the same thing that the
attr command does in the example above.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10199f1.large.jpg"><img src="10199f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MinorCapFs Extended Attributes
</p></div></div><p>
Composition is almost as important as decomposition. Where the usage of
extended attributes for decomposition may be strange and new, composition
uses a construct that we probably are all much more comfortable with,
the construct of using symbolic links. Next to decomposition, MinorCapFs
provides the ability to create symbolic links in the same way that
the filesystems we are used to do. Thus, MinorCapFs combines two basic
functionalities for doing simple unattenuated decomposition of directory
tree graphs and for doing composition of directory graphs from subgraphs.
</p><p>
You could say that MinorCapFs provides the simplest bare-level form
of unattenuated capability-based access control. But, what holds the
top-level capability? And, how are subgraphs delegated to individual
processes? That's where a second filesystem comes in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xde7958"></a>
MinorViewFs</h2></div></div><p>
As MinorCapFs provides for tree graph decomposition and composition
constructs, something has to pass sparse capabilities to processes in
order for any process to become able to use MinorCapFs.
</p><p>
To see how we need to solve this, let's take a step back and look at the
parallelisms we are trying to exploit. We are trying to make processes
into a coarser-grained form of object that, just like objects in any OO
language, have private data members. There are two ways to look at the
process as such. First, there is the traditional view of nonpersistent
processes where all state held by the process disappears when the system
reboots or ends for any other reason. You could look at this form of
delegation as a better alternative to the troublesome usage of temp
directories. Temporary files, by default, would become private to the
process until the process delegates them explicitly to other processes.
</p><p>
It is important to note that the temp provision of MinorViewFs is not
a reference-counting garbage-collection system. Delegated subgraphs
instantly will become invalid at the time the owning nonpersistent
process dies.
</p><p>
MinorViewFs delegates subgraphs to individual processes 
by means of two symbolic links under /mnt/minorfs/priv (Figure 2). Each
process reading these symbolic links will have a completely different set
of subgraph sparse capabilities delegated to it. The second symbolic link
/mnt/minorfs/priv/tmp points to the temporary subgraph described above.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10199f2.large.jpg"><img src="10199f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MinorViewFs Links
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xdde5b0"></a>
Pseudo-Persistent Processes According to MinorViewFs</h2></div></div><p>
Although delegation of temporary subgraphs to processes is relatively
simple, the concept of the same process being an incarnation of some
pseudo-persistent process needs a bit more thought.
</p><p>
MinorViewFs looks at pseudo-persistent processes on a
so-called n-th claim basis. What it basically boils down to is that
if a program is instantiated while two earlier instantiated versions of
the program already are running, the new process will claim the third
slot. If the system is rebooted, you also will need to restart the first
and second instantiation of the program.
</p><p>
Although appropriate for d&aelig;mon-like programs, this, indeed, may be
inconvenient for programs like editors and other user-driven programs. To
work around these problems, and also to work around the problem posed
by scripts and Java programs all being instances of the same program,
MinorViewFs uses some simple tricks to determine program, or more
specifically, program-invocation-based identity.
</p><p>
So how does MinorViewFs determine a program-invocation identity? First,
there is the process parent chain. The process parent chain, including
both programs and libraries loaded by those programs, contributes to a
unique identity for the invocation. If the parent chain is insufficient
as an invocation identity, the system administrator could add a config file
under /etc/minorfs/.
</p><p>
Here is an example of a config file for the E language
interpreter:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;codefile path="/usr/local/e/e.jar" cmdline="true" slots="256"&gt;
    &lt;env&gt;DISPLAY&lt;/env&gt;
&lt;/codefile&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The example config adds the command line to the identifying
properties of the program invocation. So, using optional config files,
MinorViewFs is able to create and re-create a uniquely identifying set
of data that allows it to re-delegate a subgraph to a new incarnation
of the same program.
</p><p>
The E language named above takes this concept one step further; it
allows large subsystems within an E program to be taken together and be
serialized and synchronized to disk storage automatically. What's
more, the E language is an object-capability language; thus, combining
AppArmor and MinorFs with the E language allows you to combine both
least authority and private storage all the way down to the object level
of granularity. Although E is a bit of an esoteric language, it is a
mature and complete language that is worth considering when doing high-integrity projects.
</p><p>
When a process is started and accesses the /mnt/minorfs/priv/home symbolic
link, this symbolic link will point to the same MinorCapFs subgraph as
the previous time the program was invoked into the same slot.
</p><p>
Next to being useful to new programs designed with privilege
separation and least authority in mind, MinorViewFs also can be used with
legacy programs like the SSH client. This does, however, involve the usage
of the admin tool 2rulethemall that helps the user bypass the basic
process-based access-control mechanism with a per-user password. You
can put your unprotected SSH private key in the SSH client's private
persistent storage space. Again, no program not run by root other than
MinorViewFs, SSH or 2rulethemall would be able to access the private key.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcee580.0xddea28"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
MinorFs brings an extreme (capability-based) form of discretionary access
control to your AppArmorized Linux system. It uses a form of access control
that embraces delegation as a beneficial thing for security. Although
MinorFs
still is being developed, and is incomplete, it already should provide a
useful and intuitive way to create privilege-separated programs that use
filesystem access. It provides a way to protect serialized data stored on disk for
persistent processes, and a way to protect process private
data. And, it's an alternative to the troublesome usage of temp directories.
</p><p>
Upcoming versions of MinorFs will include a third filesystem, MinorCtkrFs
that will implement attenuation in a generic way based on the so-called
Caretaker pattern. This MinorCtkrFs should add different kinds of read-only capabilities to files and directories, as well as revocable read/write
and read-only capabilities.
