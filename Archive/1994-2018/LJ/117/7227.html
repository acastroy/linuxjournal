Whether you're designing a new home
theater, an observatory or security software,
this issue has something for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe60580.0xf58298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Wouldn't things be different if you were in charge?
Whether you want to archive your favorite TV
shows on DVD, add an extra security check for
device drivers without leaking information to
marketing people or simply port Linux to your new
64-processor server, you'd do things better if
you ran the place.
</p><p>
I've got news for you. You do run the place.
You're the CEO of a multinational technology
empire that has a cooperative research and
development program with governments, companies
and universities around the world, even your
friend's hot new startup.
</p><p>
If you don't believe me, look at the COPYING
and LICENSE files already on your hard drive.
Whether you're working for yourself, starting a
company or even toiling at a big company, you
are free to partake in and build on the greatest
information technology research effort ever.
And unlike big slow &ldquo;shared source&rdquo; deals, you don't
need to call a lawyer to plug in and
start building.

Personal Video Your Way</h2></div></div><p>
There's no better proof of that than Christian
A. Herzog's article on page 30. Want a personal
video recorder that will let you make a
backup? As long as the major electronics
vendors design their products for cable company
lawyers, you'll make the TV viewers in your family
happier than the vendors ever will.
</p><p>
While you're watching TV, your hard drives are
silently, or maybe not so silently, spinning
themselves to death. With Bruce Allen's article on
page 74, you can get an early warning and replace
a drive on your schedule, not in the middle of
the night when it fails on its own.

Kernel Power</h2></div></div><p>
In this special kernel issue, you'll learn that
cache isn't merely a processor spec to brag about.
It's a complex resource you can either use well or
&ldquo;blow the cache&rdquo; and go as slow
as main memory. Find out how Linux uses cache in
James Bottomley's article on page 58.
</p><p>
There's plenty of other kernel innovation in
this issue too. Check out Greg Kroah-Hartman's
implementation of cryptographically signed kernel
modules on page 48.
And Paul E. McKenney is back, this time with
Dipankar Sarma and Maneesh Soni, to explain a big
performance win for SMP servers on page 38.

Secrets of the Software Masters</h2></div></div><p>
Lisa Corsetti wanted a way to check whether the
Ethernet cable is plugged in. The answer opened
the door to the mysteries of ioctls, and it's all
explained on page 54.
</p><p>
Every issue, Marcel Gagn&eacute; explores some new area of
software for Linux, and this time he's creating
simulated structures from molecules to bridges.
Can you build something that will stand up? Or how
many links do you need to cut to make it fall?
Find out on page 18.
