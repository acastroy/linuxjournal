Mondo and Mindi Tips</h4><p>
Thanks for the article about restoring with Mondo and Mindi in the October
2003 issue. It was good, but it could have included a couple more
options, in my opinion. Option <tt  >-g</tt> gives a nice graphical interface to
the restoration process. Option <tt  >-l GRUB -f /dev/xxx</tt>
ensures that
if one uses the GRUB loader, it will be integrated nicely. Option
<tt  >-k
FAILSAFE</tt> adds compliance with Debian/GNU. I believe this last one
is important for Debian users.

NEC Source Code?</h4><p>
I was very interested in your article about NEC's fault-tolerant server
[<i  >LJ</i>, October 2003].
I'm an IT consultant here in Buenos Aires, Argentina with some exposure
to fault-tolerant and mission-critical applications.
I contacted Mr John Fitzsimmons (of Aspire
Communications) four or five months ago in order to help me get the
source code for NEC's FT Linux. As I understand it, the software
must be released under the GPL, but as of today I wasn't able
to get the software. So, it was great to know from your article
that &ldquo;...NEC told us they are firmly committed to releasing
all changes to the public under GPL.&rdquo; I think I will have
to wait just a little longer. Do you have an approximate date
for that release?
</p><p>
One other point, as the article stated, &ldquo;At the time of this writing,
NEC was reviewing and documenting its kernel changes for a planned public
release, perhaps through OSDL's Carrier Grade Linux Project...&rdquo;, could
you tell me what I should do to get the release from OSDL? Will it be
available to the general public or to OSDL members only?

I am not aware of any such release to date. I am copying
Mr. Fitzsimmons on this note, in hope that he may have some
comment.

Electronic-Only Subscription?</h4><p>
Just wondering if you are going to have an electronic copy of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> for subscription. For readers overseas, the subscription rate is
kind of expensive. I guess that's due to the shipping cost.
It would be really helpful if you could provide the electronic
copy as a subscription option, with the same cost as the subscription
rate within the States, or cheaper.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Simon   <br><br>
</p><p>
You're not the first person who has asked this. We don't do
this yet, but I've asked our subscription department to find
out if we can.  &mdash;Ed.

Mick's LDAP and IMAP Corrections</h4><p>
There are two errors in my article &ldquo;Secure Mail with LDAP and
IMAP, Part I&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, November 2003].
First, early in the article I say (about Cyrus IMAP) &ldquo;...use of databases
rather than flat files to store messages has an obvious performance
benefit.&rdquo;
Actually, although Cyrus IMAP does use database files for indexing messages,
it stores the messages themselves as individual flat text files.
</p><p>
Second, later in the article, I correctly point out that to configure Cyrus SASL
on SuSE to use LDAP, you must edit the parameter SASLAUTHD_AUTHMECH
in /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd. The problem is, the Cyrus SASL package in
SuSE doesn't have LDAP support compiled in. You either need to
build your own LDAP-enabled package with SuSE's cyrus-sasl2 source-RPM
(SRPM) or forego direct LDAP support in SASL altogether and use the
PAM method instead, which <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> compiled in by default.
In the latter case, you need to install the module pam_ldap, and then
create a file, /etc/pam.d/imap, containing these lines:


<pre     class="programlisting">
  #%PAM-1.0
  auth       required     /lib/security/pam_ldap.so
  account    required     /lib/security/pam_ldap.so
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, copy the file /usr/shage/doc/packages/pam_ldap/ldap.conf to
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf, and edit it to match your environment (the
most relevant settings are host, base, binddn, bindpw and
TLS_REQCERT). Finally, edit /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd to include this line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SASLAUTHD_AUTHMECH=pam
</pre>
</p><p>
I apologize for any confusion or inconvenience that either error may
have caused.

Busy Chef Working On Another Book</h4><p>
Tinyminds' Tony Brijeski (Fragadelic) recently had the pleasure
of sitting down with Marcel Gagn&eacute;over some coffee and asked
him some questions about his recently released book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Moving
to Linux: Kiss the Blue Screen of Death Goodbye</em></span> and his views
on where Linux is today. He even spilled the beans on the new
book he is currently working on; you'll have to read the
interview to find out about it at <a href="http://www.tinyminds.org" target="_self">www.tinyminds.org</a>.

Modula-3 Better than C++ and Ada</h4><p>
This letter to the editor is a response to Dennis
Ludwig's letter &ldquo;Ada Isn't Awful&rdquo;, in the November 2003 issue.
I am a counter-example to Dennis Ludwig's statement &ldquo;I have yet to meet
an Ada basher who really knows the language.&rdquo;
I have programmed in
Ada, mostly full-time since 1986, done serious development work on three
Ada compilers and served as a resident Ada language lawyer for over
ten years. It's awful, and I hate it. That said, it's not half as
bad as C++, to which Ludwig primarily seems to compare Ada.
I do agree with much of his cited Web article.
Both languages are horribly over-complicated to a similar degree.
Most working programmers in either language don't even come close to
understanding their language. At least Ada is strongly type-safe, while
C++ inherited all of C's worst type-unsafe and &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; behaviours,
so lack of understanding in Ada is more likely to show up as compile
errors instead of bugs.
</p><p>
But the best languages, such as the Pascals, Modula-2 and the Oberons, are
an order of magnitude simpler, and some of them have useful feature lists
comparable to Ada. My favorite is Modula-3, with a language definition
ten times smaller than Ada. It has a more flexible type-safe separate
compilation, far more powerful information hiding capabilities and a
choice of garbage-collected or explicitly deallocated heap objects,
none of which are in Ada. Ada does non-integer fixed-point types,
which is very rare. Otherwise, the feature-list differences are minor.
Interested readers can read my more complete summary
of the differences between Modula-3 and Ada at <a href="http://www.cs.wichita.edu/~rodney/languages/Modula-Ada-comparison.txt" target="_self">www.cs.wichita.edu/~rodney/languages/Modula-Ada-comparison.txt</a>.

TALOSS Participants</h4><p>
In the November 2003 issue, acknowledgements were inadvertently omitted
from the TALOSS (Three-Dimensional Advanced Localization Observation
Submarine Software) article. Mr Ken Lima of NUWC was the originator of the
TALOSS concept and the project's manager, without whose leadership this
project would not be possible. The authors also would like to thank the
Office of Naval Research (ONR) Code 311 (Mr Paul Quinn, Mr Gary Toth
and Dr Larry Rosenblum) for the funds to complete the project.
</p><p>
ONR (Dr Rosenblum) funded Dr Gregory Neilsen and Mr Gary Graf
of Arizona State University to develop software that computes the
intersection of irregular 3-D regions within TALOSS. That software is the
same software included in TALOSS as described in the subject article. A
patent application for this software already has been prepared by its
inventors (Graf, Nielsen, Lima and Drury).
</p><p>
A major portion of the TALOSS software was written at Virginia Tech
University under the direction of the NUWC by graduate student, Fernando
DasNeves. The funding for his work was provided under a NAVCITTI Virginia
Tech grant administered by ONR (Dr Rosenblum).
</p><p>
The Naval Research Laboratory contributed that laboratory's expertise in
3-D rendering and visualization to the NUWC-led project. NRL (initially
Mr Rob King), conducted research on 3-D interactive devices in the
immersive variant of the TALOSS. Mr Douglas Maxwell, then an NRL
employee, subsequently developed a 3-D grid-based approach to ocean floor
rendering within TALOSS using the digital nautical chart database.
Mr Maxwell also developed the collision detection algorithms used
in TALOSS. Mr Maxwell's primary role, since joining NUWC a year ago,
has been as a technical consultant to the project.
</p><p>
Mr Richard Shell of NUWC has served as the technical lead for the
TALOSS Project for the past three years. Mr Todd Drury is the NUWC software
development lead for TALOSS and has been responsible for the design and
development of the TALOSS software for the past three years. The bottom
rendering approach currently implemented in TALOSS and referenced in the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> article is Mr Drury's work, with Mr
Maxwell's as a candidate
to follow. A patent for this software was submitted several months ago.
</p><p>
The authors would like to express regret in the inadvertent omission of
these acknowledgements. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of all
involved, this project was a resounding success.

More on Cluster Apps Please</h4><p>
I have had a personal nagging curiosity to build my own home cluster
out of a few boxes that are readily available. Once I have it, what can
I possibly do? Regarding that question, your November 2003 issue was fantastic
but lacked the one thing I would like to read more about. Could you
maybe consider an article describing the different applications that
are available for clusters?

Linux Training?</h4><p>
As a self-taught Linux user, I really enjoy and appreciate the information
that gets published in <i  >LJ</i>. I am wanting to learn more
and am looking
for courses in Linux, but only seem to find the occasional
Linux conference or workshops that offer Linux certifications. Being
Linux-certified is my goal, but I know I still require classroom study.
Can you point me in the right direction? Thanks! Keep up the good work!

fgets Good, gets Bad</h4><p>
I enjoyed Cal Erickson's article, &ldquo;Writing Secure Programs&rdquo;,
in the November 2003 issue, and definitely plan on looking at
FlawFinder and other tools.
One nit: &ldquo;Do not use fgets when reading data, as this allows
overflows.&rdquo;
I think this was a typo; it should have read &ldquo;gets...allows
overflows&rdquo;, because fgets has a length parameter.

License for Bioinformatics Software</h4><p>
In the November 2003 cover article, &ldquo;Sequencing the SARS
Virus&rdquo;, Krzywinski and Butterfield refer to phred,
phrap and consed as the &ldquo;open-source workhorses&rdquo; of the Human Genome
Project.
Although these programs are indeed bioinformatics workhorses, and although
the no-fee academic licensing terms under which they are available
are generous by proprietary software standards, the terms under which
they are distributed do not conform to the Open Source definition at
least to the extent that they discriminate against fields of endeavor.
The terms apply to academic or nonprofit use but not to business use
(Open Source definition version 1.9, section 6).
</p><p>
BLAST, another workhorse mentioned in the article, has diverged into two
main branches, one in the public domain (which can be obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI]) and one distributed
in a fashion similar to phred, phrap and consed.
