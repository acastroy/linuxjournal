Signed kernel modules have been a feature of other operating
systems for a number of years. Some people and companies like
the idea of installing only modules (or drivers, as they are
sometimes called) that are known to be blessed by some authority in their
operating systems. Given the changes in how
Linux loads kernel modules, signed kernel modules easily can be added to
the Linux kernel. This article discusses how I have
implemented this feature and details how to use it.
</p><p>
In a signed kernel module, someone has inserted a
digital signature into the module stating they trust this specific
module. I am not going to try to persuade anyone that Linux
should have this ability, that it should be required or even that it
provides increased security. I describe only how to do
it and provide the method for its implementation, if anyone
wants to use it.
</p><p>
Public key cryptography is used to make signed kernel modules work. For an overview of the RSA
public key cryptographic algorithm&mdash;what it is and how it
works&mdash;see the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web article at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6826" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6826</a>. This article
assumes readers are familiar with the basics of
public-key cryptography and that they are able to patch, build
and load a new Linux kernel onto their machines. For
instructions on how to build and load a new kernel, see
the very helpful Linux Kernel HOWTO located at
<a href="http://www.tldp.org" target="_self">www.tldp.org</a>.
</p><p>
In the 2.5 kernel development series, Rusty Russell rewrote the
way Linux kernel modules work. In previous kernels, the
majority of the module loading logic was stored in user space. With
Rusty's changes, all of that logic moved into the kernel,
reducing the amount of architecture-independent logic and
simplifying the user interface greatly. One nice side benefit
of this is the kernel now has access to the entire module
file in raw form. The kernel module simply is a file in
ELF format. ELF stands for executable and linking format and
is the format used for executable programs. The ELF
specification can be found in text form at <a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/ELF.txt" target="_self">www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/ELF.txt</a>.
</p><p>
ELF files are comprised of different sections. These
sections can be seen by running the readelf
program. For example:


<pre     class="screen">
$ readelf -S visor.ko
There are 23 section headers, starting at offset 0x3954:

Because ELF files are made up of sections, it is
easy to add a new section to the module file and have
the kernel read it into memory when it tries to load the module.
If we put an RSA-signed section into the module, the kernel can
decrypt the signature and compare it to the signature of the
file it just loaded. If it matches, the signature is valid
and the module is inserted successfully into the kernel's
memory. If the signature does not match, either something has
been tampered with in the module or the module was not signed
with a proper key. The module then can be rejected&mdash;that is
what my patch does.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddc580.0x1ed4710"></a>How the Kernel Code Works</h2></div></div><p>
When the kernel is told to load a module, the code in the file
kernel/module.c is run. In that file, the
function load_module does all of the
work of breaking the module into the proper sections,
checking memory locations, checking symbols and all the other tasks a
linker generally does. The patch modifies this function and
adds the following lines of code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if (module_check_sig(hdr, sechdrs, secstrings)) {
   err = -EPERM;
    goto free_hdr;
}
</pre>

</p><p>
This new function, module_check_sig does all
of the module signature-checking logic. If it returns an error,
the error <tt  >Improper Permission</tt> is returned to the user
and module loading is aborted. If the function returns a
0, meaning no error occurred, the module load
procedure continues on successfully.
</p><p>
The module_check_sig function is located in
the file kernel/module-sig.c. The first
thing the function does is check to see if a signature
is located within the module. This is done with the
following lines of code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sig_index = 0;
for (i = 1; i &lt; hdr-&gt;e_shnum; i++)
    if (strcmp(secstrings+sechdrs[i].sh_name,
               "module_sig") == 0) {
        sig_index = i;
        break;
}
if (sig_index &lt;= 0)
    return -EPERM;

</pre>
</p><p>
This bit of code loops through all of the different ELF sections
in the kernel module and looks for one called module_sig. If
it does not find the signature, it returns an error and prevents
this module from being loaded. If it does find the signature,
the function continues.
</p><p>
Once the kernel has found the module signature, it needs to
determine what the hash value is of the module it is being
asked to load. To do this, it generates the SHA1 hash of the
ELF section that contains executable code or data used by the
kernel. The kernel already contains code to generate SHA1
hashes (along with other kinds of hashes, including MD5 and MD4), so
most of the logic for this step is present already.
</p><p>
The function first allocates a crypto transformation structure
by requesting the SHA1 algorithm. It then initializes this
structure with the following lines of code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sha1_tfm = crypto_alloc_tfm("sha1", 0);
if (sha1_tfm == NULL)
    return -ENOMEM;
crypto_digest_init(sha1_tfm);

</pre>

The sha1_tfm variable is used to create the SHA1
hash of the specific portions of the ELF file that we want, as
shown in the following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (i = 1; i &lt; hdr-&gt;e_shnum; i++) {
    name = secstrings+sechdrs[i].sh_name;

    /* We only care about sections with "text" or
       "data" in their names */
    if ((strstr(name, "text") == NULL) &amp;&amp;
        (strstr(name, "data") == NULL))
        continue;
    /* avoid the ".rel.*" sections too. */
    if (strstr(name, ".rel.") != NULL)
        continue;

    temp = (void *)sechdrs[i].sh_addr;
    size = sechdrs[i].sh_size;
    do {
        memset(&amp;sg, 0x00, sizeof(*sg));
        sg.page = virt_to_page(temp);
        sg.offset = offset_in_page(temp);
        sg.length = min(size,
                        (PAGE_SIZE - sg.offset));
        size -= sg.length;
        temp += sg.length;
        crypto_digest_update(sha1_tfm, &amp;sg, 1);
    } while (size &gt; 0);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
In this code, we care only about the ELF sections with the word text or
data in their names but not ones that contain the characters
.rel. After all of the sections have been found and fed to
the SHA1 algorithm, the SHA1 hash is placed into the variable
sha1_result with the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">

crypto_digest_final(sha1_tfm, sha1_result);
crypto_free_tfm(sha1_tfm);

</pre>
</p><p>
Now that the SHA1 hash is computed and the place with the
signed hash has been found, all that is left to do is
unencrypt the signed hash and compare it to the calculated one.
This step is done in the last line of this function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

return rsa_check_sig(sig, &amp;sha1_result[0]);

</pre>
</p><p>
The rsa_check_sig function is located in the
security/rsa/rsa.c file and uses the GnuPG
code itself, which was ported to run in the kernel to unencrypt
the signature and compare the values. The description of how
this works is beyond the scope of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddc580.0x1ed4d40"></a>How the User-Space Code Works</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have seen how the kernel determines whether a module is
signed properly, how do we get a signature into a module
in the first place? Two
user-space programs, extract_pkey and
mod, and one small script,
sign (in the
security/rsa/userspace/ directory), can be found in the kernel patch. The two
programs can be built by running the Makefile
in this directory. The extract_pkey program
is used to place a public key into the kernel, and the
mod program is used by the
sign script to sign a kernel module.
</p><p>
In order to sign a module, an RSA-signing key must be generated,
which can be done by using the gnupg program. To generate an RSA-signing
key, pass the
--gen-key option to gpg:


<pre     class="screen">
$ gpg --gen-key

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (5) RSA (sign only)
Your selection?
</pre>
</p><p>
We want to create an RSA key, so we select option 5 and then choose
the default key size of 1024:

<pre     class="screen">
Your selection? 5
What keysize do you want? (1024)
Requested keysize is 1024 bits
</pre>
</p><p>
Continue answering the rest of the questions, and eventually your
RSA key is generated. But in order to use this key, we
must create an encrypting version of it. To do that, run gpg
again and edit the key you just created (in the text
below, I have named my key testkey):


<pre     class="screen">
$ gpg --edit-key testkey

</pre>
</p><p>

rest of the questions. After the key is generated, type
<tt  >quit</tt> at the prompt:

<pre     class="screen">
Command&gt; quit
Save changes? yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we have a key, we can use it to sign a kernel module.
</p><p>
To sign a module, use the sign script, which is
a simple shell script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash
module=$1
key=$2

# strip out only the sections that we care about
./mod $module $module.out

# sha1 the sections
sha1sum $module.out | awk "{print \$1}" &gt; \
$module.sha1

# encrypt the sections
gpg --no-greeting -e -o - -r $key $module.sha1 &gt; \
$module.crypt

# add the encrypted data to the module
objcopy --add-section module_sig=$module.crypt \
$module

# remove the temporary files
rm $module.out $module.sha1 $module.crypt

</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing the script does is run the program
mod on the kernel module. This program
strips out only the sections that we care about in the ELF file
and outputs them to a temporary file. The mod
program is described in more detail later.
</p><p>
After we have an ELF file that contains only the sections we
want, we generate a SHA1 hash of the file using the
sha1sum program. This SHA1 hash then is
encrypted using GPG, the key is passed to it and this encrypted
file is written out to a temporary file. The encrypted
file is added to the original module as a new ELF section with
the name module-sig. This is done with the program
objcopy. And that is it. Using common
programs already present on a Linux machine, it is easy to
create a SHA1 hash, encrypt it and add it to an ELF file.
</p><p>
The mod program also is quite simple. It takes advantage
of the fact that the libbfd library knows how to
handle ELF files and manipulates them in different ways; it is
based on the binutils program objdump.
Because the libbfd library handles all of the
heavy ELF logic, the mod program simply
can iterate through all the sections of the ELF file it wants to
with the following code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (section = abfd-&gt;sections;
     section != NULL;
     section = section-&gt;next) {
    if (section-&gt;flags &amp; SEC_HAS_CONTENTS) {
        if (bfd_section_size(abfd, section) == 0)
            continue;

        /* We only care about sections with "text"
           or "data" in their names */
        name = section-&gt;name;
        if ((strstr(name, "text") == NULL) &amp;&amp;
            (strstr(name, "data") == NULL))
            continue;

        size = bfd_section_size(abfd, section));
        data = (bfd_byte *)malloc(size);

        bfd_get_section_contents(abfd, section,
                                 (PTR)data,
                                 0, size);

        stop_offset = size / opb;

        for (addr_offset = 0;
             addr_offset &lt; stop_offset;
             ++addr_offset) {
            fprintf(out, "%c", data[addr_offset]);
        }
        free(data);
    }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we can sign a kernel module and the kernel knows how to
detect this signature, the only remaining piece
is to put our public key into the kernel so it can
decrypt the signature successfully. A lot of
discussion on the linux-kernel mailing list recently has centered on how
to handle keys within the kernel properly. That discussion
has produced some good proposals for how this aspect will be handled in
the 2.7 kernel series. But for now, we do not worry about
properly handling keys in flexible ways, so we compile it
in directly.
</p><p>
First we need to get a copy of our public key. To do this, tell
GPG to extract the key to a file called
public_key:

<pre     class="screen">
$ gpg --export -o public_key
</pre>
</p><p>
To help manipulate GPG public keys, some developers at Ericsson
created a simple program called extract_pkey
to help dissect the keys into their different pieces. I have
modified that program to generate C code for the public key.
</p><p>
Run the extract_pkey program and point it at
the public_key file you generated previously.
Have it send the output to a file called rsa_key.c:

<pre     class="screen">
$ extract_pkey public_key &gt; rsa_key.c
</pre>
</p><p>
After this step is finished, move that rsa_key.c on top of the file
in the security/rsa/ directory, replacing my
public key with yours:

<pre     class="screen">
$ mv rsa_key.c ~/linux/linux-2.6/security/rsa/
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have generated a public and private RSA key pair and
placed your public key into the kernel directory. Build the
patched kernel, making sure to select the
Module signature checking option, and then
install it. If you boot in to this kernel, you will be
allowed to load only the modules you have signed with your key,
so be careful and test this only on a development machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ddc580.0x1ed5840"></a>What Is Left to Do?</h2></div></div><p>
As shown in this article, a number of different steps are required
to generate a key, sign a kernel module and place the public
key into the kernel image. This still is a rough
development project. In order to make it more acceptable to the
kernel developers and to the Linux community in general, these steps
need to be automated, making it easier to sign all
kernel modules and handle the public key.
</p><p>
Besides the obvious need to simplify the use of this feature,
some other future goals of this project include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Move the RSA code into the generic crypto framework, allowing
other kernel features to use it.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow more than one public key to be present in the kernel,
letting multiple sources of signed kernel modules run
in a single machine.
</p></li><li><p>
Simplify the signing logic to allow GPG's native signing
functionality or possibly the functionality provided in the
bsign program to be used, instead of the
custom mod program.

I would like to thank the developers at Ericsson, who have
created a kernel patch and program called
digsig, for allowing me to use their port of
GPG to the kernel. I previously had done this, but the
implementation was horrible; thankfully, they released their
port and were very helpful. The digsig
kernel patch allows users to sign programs and prevents the
kernel from running any program not signed. More
information about this project can be found at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/disec" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/disec</a>.
</p><p>
I also would like to thank my employer, IBM, for allowing me to
work on this project, and Don Marti, for prodding me to
finish it and write this article.
