Turn Emacs into your editor of choice
with this easy customization tool.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b70298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Customizing Emacs is important to get the most out of it. You can change
the way it operates to reflect your way of doing things, which in turn
makes you more efficient. Just as custom-built boots fit better than
factory boots, a customized Emacs fits you better than standard, off-the-shelf Emacs.
</p><p>
Emacs changes can be session-specific or permanent. You can customize Emacs directly by executing commands in the mini-buffer
or by modifying variables using the set-variable command. These changes are
volatile, meaning you lose them when you end your session. To make
permanent changes, you can create or modify an init file. Emacs examines several
init files when it loads. Probably the easiest way to customize is
to edit .emacs, stored in your home directory. Before loading your .emacs
file, Emacs
loads default.el from your library path. Emacs also looks in its load
path for site-start.el, which system administrators may use to provide
site-wide customization. Alternatively, you can make permanent Emacs
changes through the Customize menu
(Options&rarr;Customize Emacs in version 21.1 and up). This gives you a
GUI-based front end for modifying your .emacs file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b703f8"></a>
Using Customize</h2></div></div><p>
Like most GUI
front ends, Customize is not as powerful as hacking the text configuration
file, but it is easier to use. Fire up the Customization group, and you
notice that Emacs builds the menus on the fly. That way it's always up
to date (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6771f1.large.jpg"><img src="6771f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Top-Level Customization Menu
</p></div></div><p>
To navigate Customize's tree structure, either
point to a button and press
Return or click on the button. Full Emacs searching also
works in the Customize buffers. Each level in
the tree is represented in a buffer, and you can
manipulate Customize buffers as usual. For example,
when you are done with a level, kill the buffer.
</p><p>
I'd like to turn on the PHP speedbar whenever I enter PHP mode,
for example, when I visit a PHP file. To do this, I follow the menu tree to PHP
mode customization (Figure 2). As you can see, I've
toggled the state but haven't yet saved my changes. I can set it only
for this session, or I can save the change for future sessions. When I
do the latter, Emacs edits my .emacs file. You can verify the change by
searching for the variable name in .emacs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6771f2.large.jpg"><img src="6771f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Setting the Speedbar to Turn On in PHP Mode
</p></div></div><p>
If you aren't sure of the name of a variable or where to find it in
Customize's vast tree, you can use regular expression searches on
variable names and their contents. If you want to change how
Emacs prints, you could search on the regex &ldquo;print&rdquo; and Emacs
would build
a custom Customize menu for you. See the menu under Options&rarr;Customize
Emacs for these and other options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b709d0"></a>
Editing Your .emacs File</h2></div></div><p>
You also can modify Emacs' behavior by editing ~/.emacs
directly. This is a good way to add function and insert bulk
customizations you may learn about from other people. For example, C mode
can be modified by setting variables that affect how it operates.
</p><p>
Many modes are customized on a per-buffer basis. This means you write
a short function that sets the variables and set that function to be
executed whenever Emacs enters the mode. The outline of it is:
</p><pre     class="screen">
(defun rays_c_mode ()
  "ray's c/c++ mode hook"
  (message "Loading Ray's C mode...")
  ...
  (message "Loading Ray's C mode... Done")
  )
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'rays_c_mode)
</pre><p>
The Lisp function defun defines a function, in this case
rays_C_mode. The function takes no parameters; it prints out messages
only for the user's benefit. The last line adds the function rays_c_mode
to C mode's mode hook, that is, a list of functions executed
whenever Emacs enters C mode. You can see more of Ray's C mode in my
personal
.emacs file (see Resources).
</p><p>

It is customary to name the variables for a particular mode by
prepending the mode's name to them. To see variables associated with
a particular mode, then, make a regex search on the variable name, with M-X
<tt  >apropos-variable</tt>. For C mode, we eliminate a lot of false hits
with the regex &ldquo;^c-&rdquo;. When Emacs returns a list of the
results, move
to that buffer and press Return on any variable that interests you
for more information.
</p><p>
To find out what else you can search on, try M-X <tt  >apropos-command RET
apropos RET. "apropos-zippy"?</tt> I'll let you examine that one.
</p><p>
A function can, of course, call other functions. This possibility is one of several
things that make editing your .emacs file and programming in Emacs Lisp more
powerful than using Customize.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b70e48"></a>
Printing</h2></div></div><p>
Emacs, as usual, offers you a lot of flexibility for printing. You can
print by sending the raw contents of the buffer to the printer. This
is quick and easy, but
it may not give you exactly what you wanted.
You have far more control over PostScript printing, so that may be the
way to go. For one thing, font-locked (colorized) buffers print in
color on color printers and in gray scale on monochrome printers, where
Ghostscript supports those features.
</p><p>
Probably the most common change to Emacs in the printing area is changing
the name of Emacs' default printer. This can be nil, which tells Emacs
to use the default printer, lp in Linux or UNIX. Or, it
can be a printer name such that the lp d&aelig;mon recognizes it as a
printer name. If you have Red Hat's printtool or similar, you can get
printer names from it. Failing that, look in /var/spool/lpd/ for the
names of your printers.
Emacs can use any printer
for which you can define a local queue, including remote printers.
</p><p>
Two variables are set to indicate the printer, one for PostScript
printing and one for non-PostScript printing. The code below shows how
I set up Emacs under Linux and Windows. The Windows definition uses a
remote printer on the computer charlesc. Setting both printers
to the same computer works only because the server is a Linux box.
The printcap detects PostScript and runs it through Ghostscript before
printing it:
</p><pre     class="screen">


;; Begin setup for printing on Win32
(if (and  (&gt;= sams-Gnu-Emacs-p 20)
	   (memq window-system '(win32 w32)))
    (progn (setq printer-name "//charlesc/lp")
	   (setq ps-printer-name "//charlesc/lp"))
  )
;; End setup for printing on Win32

;; Begin setup for printing on Linux
(if (and  (&gt;= sams-Gnu-Emacs-p 20)
	  (string-equal system-name "charlesc.localdomain"))
    (progn (setq printer-name "lp")
	   (setq ps-printer-name "lp"))
  )
;; End setup for printing on Linux

</pre><p>
Emacs' PostScript printing is very powerful. By default, it prints a
gray box at the top of each page with the buffer's name, the data,
a page number and a count.
</p><p>
You can set a text string and other characterstics of a watermark
on each page or on selected pages. For example, a watermark of
Preliminary or Draft is a good idea for code reviews; see the variable
ps-print-background-text. You also can use an EPS image, such as a picture
of Tux or the Free Software Foundation's GNU logo, for a watermark.
</p><p>
We geriatric cases who don't like 8.5 point type can change the value
of ps-font-size. The value contans two numbers, the first for landscape and
the second for portrait printing. Whether to print landscape or portrait
is controlled by the variable ps-landscape-mode.
</p><p>
You can modify the default PostScript header and add a footer as well. For
two-sided printing, you may specify left and right headers and footers.
And if you want to save trees, look at ps-n-up-printing. It lets you print
multiple pages on a sheet of paper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b71210"></a>
Font Selection</h2></div></div><p>
Emacs supports multiple frames or windows. You can launch another frame
with Ctrl-X 5 2, or remove one with Ctrl-X 5 0. The initial frame created
when Emacs is launched has a number of graphics characteristics defined
by the variable initial-frame-alist. Subsequent frames are governed by
default-frame-alist. Use these two variables identically. Each variable is
a list of sub-variables and their values, rather like a hash in Perl. For
example, to set the initial position of the first frame on the screen, use:
</p><pre     class="screen">
(setq initial-frame-alist
    '((top . 40) (left . -15)
      (width . 96) (height . 40)
      (background-color . "Gray94")
      (foreground-color . "Black")
      (cursor-color	. "red3")
      (user-position t)
      ))
</pre><p>
This definition sets the Emacs initial frame 40 pixels from the top of the
screen, 15 pixels from the right (hence the negative number for
left),
with a width of 96 characters and a height of 40 lines. It sets the default
background and foreground text colors and then sets the cursor color.
</p><p>
This definition is also where you set your font, if you don't like the default. The
program xfontsel comes with XFree86, and you can use it to find a suitable
font (Figure 3). Press Select as an option, and xfontsel puts it
into the clipboard. Add another pair of parentheses to the definition
of initial-frame-alist, insert the phrase <tt  >font . </tt> and insert a pair
of quote marks. Then recover the font definition between the quotes with
Ctrl-Y, like any other clipboard entry:
</p><pre     class="screen">
(font . "-adobe-courier-*-r-*-*-*-140-*-*-*-*-*-*")
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6771f3.large.jpg"><img src="6771f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Selecting a Font with X's Utility Program xfontsel
</p></div></div><p>
If you are wondering how I get the colors in my screenshots, that's how I
do it.
</p><p>
If you have problems with these settings, look in your .Xresources file for any
Emacs settings. Any settings in .Xresources overrides these definitions. To
get rid of the overrides,
comment them out of the .Xresources file and restart X.
</p><p>
Until recently, Emacs had no support for variable-width fonts, and fixed-width fonts are fine for most purposes. But with support for proportional
fonts and non-English character sets included in recent versions, you now can define
your own sets of fonts within Emacs. Fontsets allow word-processor ease
of control over fonts. For examples, take a look at the headers in Emacs' Info and
the Customize menus; see also Emacs' info nodes on fontsets.
</p><p>
For more information on fonts under X, see Emacs' info node on Font
Specification Options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b717e8"></a>
The Speedbar</h2></div></div><p>
I explained how to automate turning on the speedbar in the discussion of
the Customize Emacs system. Speedbar is a separate frame (window) that
allows mouse-click navigation among Emacs buffers. As you can see from
the illustration, the speedbar allows for tree structures, like Emacs'
Info  system. Click on the + to open subnodes, and click on the &ndash; to
close them (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6771f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Emacs' Speedbar Point-and-Click Browsing Interface
</p></div></div><p>
When you are editing in certain modes&mdash;Rmail, Info and GUD, for
example&mdash;the speedbar
shows other selections to be edited in that mode. For example, when you
are in Info mode, the speedbar displays nodes. Otherwise, it shows files
in the directory where the file in the current buffer is located.
</p><p>
If you have a lot of files open in Emacs, the speedbar is a useful
tool. I often have more than 30 files open simultaneously, and the
speedbar helps me manage and switch between them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1b71b58"></a>
Emacs Is for E-mail</h2></div></div><p>
In the article &ldquo;Getting Started with Emacs&rdquo;,
<i  >LJ</i>, March, 2003, I demonstrated
how to use Emacs as a server, letting programs like crontab and
mutt use Emacs for file editing. To carry this further, you can use Emacs as the editor
for any application that can call on an external editor, including mail
readers. However, Emacs has at least two mail modes and a powerful
newsreader called GNUS.
</p><p>
To send a message, Ctrl-X M (or M-X <tt  >mail</tt>)
puts you in mail mode. Simply edit
a message and send it (Figure 5). As the screen capture
shows, you see a skeleton of an e-mail ready for you to fill in the
blanks. You can use control character sequences to move to (and create,
if necessary) additional headers, like FCC.
You can use tab completion in the headers. There, it looks at local
system users and the contents of any e-mail aliases you have defined in
your .emacs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6771f5.large.jpg"><img src="6771f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A Skeleton E-mail in Emacs' Mail Mode
</p></div></div><p>
You can insert your signature with Ctrl-C Ctrl-W, or you can have Emacs do
that for you by setting mail-signature to <tt  >t</tt> in your
.emacs file.
If you want to get fancy and write a Lisp program to select a signature for you
based on, well, whatever you can write Lisp code to detect.
</p><p>
You can run a spell-checker on your message. Entering M-X
<tt  >ispell-message</tt>
checks only the body of the message, skipping any quoted material.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a78580.0x1f6a328"></a>
Reading Mail</h2></div></div><p>
In Emacs, read and reply to your incoming mail with rmail mode (M-X
<tt  >rmail</tt>) (Figure 6). One of the first things you may
wish to do is create a summary buffer or automate it by modifying the
rmail mode hook. This creates a buffer familiar to most users:
one line per message with the date, source e-mail address, data size
and subject in that line. As you can see in Figure 7,
the message in the rmail buffer is highlighted in green. The
normal Emacs navigation keys work in the summary buffer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6771f6.large.jpg"><img src="6771f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. An E-mail Message in rmail Mode
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6771f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. rmail Mode with a Summary
</p></div></div><p>
Emacs mail operates in a somewhat convoluted way in order to accommodate
multiple operating systems. When you start an rmail buffer, it moves
mail from your inbox file, typically in /var/spool/mail on Linux, into a
file, ~/RMAIL. This is the file you normally edit. You can put e-mail into
~/RMAIL at any time with the G key. If you have a POP or IMAP account,
try using fetchmail to put your mail in the inbox.
</p><p>
Emacs uses the Babyl mail file format. You can export individual messages
as text files; entire rmail files can be exported in mailbox format.
</p><p>
Most mail readers use multiple mail files (directories, if they use
maildir mail format). Emacs can shift from one rmail file to another,
but you may not need to. Instead, you can create customized summaries
using regular expressions and other search patterns. You can specify
summaries based on recipients, a regular expression search within the
subject or labels.
</p><p>
You can have multiple rmail files and associate each one with one or
more inboxes. This means that folks with spam filters such as SpamAssassin, already running or using procmail recipes to deliver their e-mail to separate
files need not abandon that investment. Each time you visit an rmail file,
Emacs gets any new mail from the associated input files.
</p><p>
You can reply and forward e-mail in rmail mode. Either one opens up a
mail mode buffer with the e-mail headers already completed. You can use
Ctrl-C Ctrl-Y to yank in the message to which you are replying. If you want to
reply to multiple e-mails, switch to the rmail buffer, select a different
message, switch back and yank the new current message. To be RFC-compliant, you will have to set the quoting character by customizing
mail-yank-prefix to use the string &gt;.
