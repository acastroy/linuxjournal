Streamline your Web site with a
professional newspaper-like publishing model. With
Bricolage, you can set up approvals and keep track
of who's editing what.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b12f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you publish an on-line newspaper or magazine, you probably
already have looked into a content management system (CMS). CMS software
makes it easy to keep track of the many pages on a Web site by handling
issues as varied as users, groups, permissions, editing
responsibilities and site-wide templates. The more pages on your
site, or the more people working on it, the more likely it is that you
can benefit from a CMS.
</p><p>
Many companies have sprung up to meet this need, offering
CMS software that claims to do everything but write your site's
content. (Although given the quality of writing on some sites, you
sometimes have to wonder.) It has taken some time,
but a number of open-source CMS packages are available that can fulfill even the most
complex site requirements. One of the most powerful and popular
packages is Bricolage, which combines the mod_perl module for Apache,
the PostgreSQL relational database and the HTML::Mason templating
system into one neat package (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bricolage" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/bricolage</a>).
</p><p>
In previous installments of this column, we looked at some basic
configurations of a Mason system, including alerts that can be set to
fire when certain events occur.
Until now, however, we have neglected the most important task of all for a
CMS, namely, publishing content to an actual Web site. This month, we
follow an article as it goes from inception to publication,
working its way down the Bricolage publishing pathway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b1500"></a>
Creating a Site</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in all of this is to create a Web site on which the
content can be published. I created a virtual host named
output.lerner.co.il on my server, with its own directories for error
and access logs. I then added an appropriate VirtualHost directive in
my Apache configuration file, as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost 69.55.225.93&gt;
    ServerName output.lerner.co.il
    ServerAdmin reuven@lerner.co.il
    DocumentRoot /usr/local/apache/
    &#8618;v-sites/output.lerner.co.il/www
    CustomLog /usr/local/apache/v-sites/
    &#8618;output.lerner.co.il/logs/access-log combined
    CustomLog /usr/local/apache/v-sites/
    &#8618;output.lerner.co.il/logs/referer-log referer
    ErrorLog /usr/local/apache/v-sites/
    &#8618;output.lerner.co.il/logs/error-log
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, when my server receives a request for
output.lerner.co.il, it looks in the output.lerner.co.il/www
directory rather than in the main document root, generally defined to be
/usr/local/apache/htdocs.
</p><p>
Before we can publish any articles to the Web with Bricolage, we must
tell the CMS where new files should be deposited. In Bricolage, this
is done with the Destinations menu option, under the Distributions
heading. You can create multiple output destinations, allowing
you to have multiple sites with a single Bricolage instance. This might
be the case for a publisher whose staff produces several different
newspapers. Each output destination can be on the local filesystem or
on a remote site accessed by FTP.
</p><p>
Click on New Destination to create a new publishing destination.
Most small sites need only a single channel, which allows all
documents to be exported to the site's DocumentRoot on the disk. You
then must indicate a few things: 1) whether the Web site
resides on the same computer as the Bricolage system or whether files must
be copied to a remote computer using FTP and 2) the output channels to
which this should be made private. We assume the Bricolage
server and the final Web server are on the same computer&mdash;but in a
larger-scale environment, especially where performance is an issue,
it would be wise to split them up. The first new destination
screen is shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7202f1.large.jpg"><img src="7202f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Setting Up a New Destination
</p></div></div><p>
Although Bricolage allows you to define new output channels,
keep the default Web channel for now. The difference between
output channels and destinations can be a bit confusing at first.
Think of an output channel as a logical target and a destination
as a physical target, and then realize that you can mix and match them
in all sorts of different ways. You can have multiple output
channels going to a single destination or a single output channel
going to multiple destinations.
</p><p>
Once you have provided some basic information about your new destination,
you have to define at least one action
(&ldquo;move&rdquo;)
and then define the most important part, the server section. In the server
section you
indicate the server on which the files eventually should be deposited.
As we've already indicated that we are copying files rather
than using FTP, we need to fill in only the destination pathname,
which should match the DocumentRoot of the Apache virtual host where the
document will be available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b1a28"></a>
Writing and Publishing</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have created an output channel, we can go back and create
a new story, putting on our reporter hat. (Remember, each of these
menus normally is meant to be used by a different person or group of
people on a magazine's staff.) Click on New Story in the the
Story menu, giving it the minimum of a title, a category (/, unless you have defined other categories) and a priority
(normal). You also can set the publication date, which
indicates not only when the story should be published to the Web, but
also the URL with which it should be available. Longtime readers of
Salon.com probably have noticed that each story's URL contains the
date of publication; it should come as no surprise that Bricolage,
which evolved from the CMS developed at Salon, continues in that
tradition.
</p><p>
When you have filled in this basic information, click on the Create
button. You now have the opportunity to create the text of your
article, adding paragraphs (one at a time or separated by blank lines
using the bulk Edit button). When your story is finished, you can
submit it to the Edit Desk using the Check In button at the bottom
of the page, sending it to the Edit Desk.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the nature of a Web-based interface and the flexibility
that Bricolage offers means that the interface for Bricolage often is
a bit complex, forcing you to work with a number of different Submit
buttons. Fortunately, the buttons are labeled clearly, which means
that even if you end up saving your story rather than checking it in to
the Edit Desk, you probably aren't going to delete the story accidentally. That
said, new Bricolage users would be wise to read the labels on the
buttons before assuming that all Submit buttons are created equal.
</p><p>
Now that we have submitted the article to the Edit Desk, we
change hats once again and pretend to be the editor who has to review
the story. Click on the Edit menu under the Desks subheading in
the Stories menu, and you get a list of all stories
currently checked in to the edit desk (Figure 2). Stories
already published have a P in their titlebars. Stories
checked out (that is, available for changes by an editor) can be
edited. But we're not going to edit the story right now, because we know
that the author is one who consistently finishes his sentences and
carefully double-checks his work. For now, we send it along to the
Publish Desk, where things are reviewed one last time and then sent
to the Web. We do this by choosing Publish on the Move To menu
and then clicking Move Assets.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7202f2.large.jpg"><img src="7202f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. At the Edit Desk, you can check for
stories ready to edit.
</p></div></div><p>
We then can go to the Publish Desk, where items are reviewed one
final time before they are published to the Web. Notice that
Bricolage comes with built-in support for copyediting and legal
reviews. You can create new desks as well, if your organizational
structure is more complicated than the default setup.
</p><p>
In many ways, the Publish Desk is the same as the others; it allows you
to add notes to a story, view a story's edit trail or even see the log of
changes. You also can edit the story at the Publish Desk by checking
it out and clicking on the Edit link. The most important parts of
the Publish Desk, however, are the additional check box (marked
Publish, not surprisingly) and a button marked Publish Checked (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7202f3.large.jpg"><img src="7202f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Review stories for publication at the Publish Desk.
</p></div></div><p>
When you click on Publish Checked, Bricolage gives you the option of
indicating when the story should be published. This is different from
the publication date of the story. You might want a story with a
February 1st date, for example, to be available on January 31st. Alternatively,
you might want it to be available only on February 7th. Clicking on
the Publish Assets button puts this process in place, with Bricolage
reporting it has published the story (or stories) in question.
And sure enough, our document has been published to the URL we
assigned it earlier&mdash;in this case, as index.html in the DocumentRoot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b9580.0x23b20b0"></a>
Management Issues</h2></div></div><p>
When a print newspaper or magazine publishes a story, there is no way
to change what has been displayed. But on the Web, all you need to do
is modify the story in question, and everyone immediately sees the
changes. Ignoring the issues of journalistic ethics raised
by this technological ability, Bricolage makes it easy to correct a
story and then redeploy it on the site.
</p><p>
To modify an already-published story, go to the Active Stories menu
item, which brings up a list of stories currently
available. You can choose to check out a story and make it available
for editing by the current user. (Bricolage's version-control system
ensures that only one person can edit a file at a time.) You then
can edit the file and send it to the Edit Desk, just as you did when you
originally wrote the story. And as before, the Edit Desk must pass it
along to the Publish Desk; from there it can be published to the
Web.
</p><p>
If you have worked on only small Web sites before, then this task
might appear to be far too complicated. After all, isn't part of the
Web's beauty the fact that we can change documents and immediately see
the results of those changes?
It's true that a content management system introduces a set of
trade-offs into the workings of a Web site. No longer can you simply
modify a file on the disk; you must log in, check the file out, make
the modifications, check it back in and send it to the Publish
Desk, which might even reject your changes.
</p><p>
But complicated and bureaucratic as this procedure might be, it is
better than the alternative, which is multiple people fighting over
ownership of a file or different people trying to edit a
file&mdash;sometimes in different ways&mdash;on a live site. A CMS is designed
to slow you down, much as a seat belt is designed to prevent you from
moving too much. But in both cases, the restrictions are designed to
help you by stopping you from hurting yourself.
Moreover, this bureaucracy can save you in a pinch, because every
previous version of the document always is available. So if you
accidentally removed half of an important story, you can revert
to the previous version that Bricolage has stored in its database.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Bricolage is a complete, sophisticated open-source content management
system with an impressive array of features. As we saw this month, we
easily can set up a Bricolage-based site and publish stories through a
distribution channel that we created with a simple set of virtual
host definitions in our Apache configuration. Next column, we
conclude our discussion of Bricolage by looking at ways in which we
can customize the output templates, turning a simple black-and-white
publication into something with more pizzazz.
