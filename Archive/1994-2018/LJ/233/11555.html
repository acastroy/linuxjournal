AdaCore's GNAT Pro for Wind River Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The slickest thing about the GNAT Pro 7.1 Ada development environment for Wind
River Linux is the ability to use AdaCore and Wind River products together to
develop applications that freely combine modules in Ada, C and C++. Wind River
Linux is a leading commercial-grade Linux solution for embedded device
development. In addition, developers can manipulate and analyze Ada applications
via Wind River's Linux browser and tools. This new implementation of GNAT
Pro supports all versions of Ada and is tightly integrated into the Wind River
Workbench development environment. AdaCore says that the new GNAT Pro solution
brings the Ada development community everything it needs to build and support
highly differentiated solutions and deploy them on an industry-leading
commercial-grade Linux solution, based on the Yocto Project open-source
development infrastructure. GNAT Pro for Wind River Linux includes support for
the Wind River Linux 4.3 platform, the PowerPC and Power PC e500v2 target
platforms, and the Linux host.

Symantec's Data Insight</h2></div></div><p>
The rapid growth of unstructured data and the lack of control of &ldquo;dark
data&rdquo;
means many data centers are stocking petabytes of information but not using it
as a business asset. Symantec's solution to help organizations better understand
their unstructured data is Data Insight, which has been upgraded to version 4.0.
Symantec notes how unstructured data&mdash;about which many organizations have
minimal awareness&mdash;not only results in high storage costs but also presents the
potential for compliance infractions and higher organizational risks. New
enhancements to Data Insight 4.0 will allow users to identify and fix problems
in a single tool, create information-rich reports, mitigate organizational and
data security risks and implement effective information lifecycle management.

Sealevel Systems' 7202e</h2></div></div><p>
Sealevel Systems, provider of industrial computing, communications and I/O
solutions, announced the release of the 7202e, a low-profile two-port RS-232 PCI
Express serial interface adapter with advanced UART architecture. For maximum
compatibility with a wide range of serial peripherals, the board supports all
RS-232 modem control signals, making it a perfect solution for interfacing
instrumentation, bar-code readers and other data acquisition/control devices.
The 7202e's high-performance 16C950 UART includes 128-byte FIFOs for
error-free operation in high-speed serial applications. All Sealevel PCI Express
serial adapters include SeaCOM software for Linux and Windows, as well as
WinSSD, a full-featured application for testing and diagnostics.

Prateek Mehta's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn OpenGL ES</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
If you are new to game development on mobile platforms, chances are that Prateek
Mehta's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn OpenGL ES: For Mobile Game and Graphics
Development</em></span> 
will help you build sophisticated, graphically rich game apps. Many of today's
sophisticated game and graphics-intense apps rely on the language and rendering
engine OpenGL ES. Whether you're an Android or iOS app developer, this book is
for you. This book ramps up its readers with the primary skills of the new
OpenGL ES 3.0 and gets them quickly into game app development without intense
study of object-oriented programming techniques. This book also demonstrates the
use of the Blender modeling software. Advanced topics include collision detection,
player-room-obstacle classes and storage classes, as well as how to apply
learned techniques in the context of the limited resources and processing
capacity on mobile devices.

Michael Graves' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital Archaeology</em></span> (Addison-Wesley Professional)</h2></div></div><p>
Publisher Addison-Wesley Professional markets Michael Graves' new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital
Archaeology</em></span> as &ldquo;the definitive, up-to-date guide to digital
forensics&rdquo;.
The rapid proliferation of cyber crime is increasing the demand for digital
forensics experts in both law enforcement and in the private sector. In
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital
Archaeology</em></span>, expert practitioner Michael Graves has written a thorough,
realistic guide to the principles and techniques of modern digital forensics.
After providing the legal issues surrounding computer forensics, Graves explains
how to investigate computer systems systematically and thoroughly to unearth
crimes or other misbehavior, and back it up with evidence that will stand up in
court. Drawing on the analogy of archaeological research, Graves explains each
key tool and method investigators use to uncover hidden information reliably in
digital systems. Graves concludes with coverage of important professional and
business issues associated with building a career in digital forensics,
including licensing and certification requirements.

SUSE Linux Enterprise</h2></div></div><p>
The hallmarks of the new SUSE Linux Enterprise Service Pack 3 are greater
scalability and security, not to mention additional industry-standard hardware
support and open-source features and enhancements. SUSE calls SUSE Linux
Enterprise 11 &ldquo;the most interoperable platform for mission-critical
computing&mdash;across physical, virtual and cloud environments&rdquo;. The service
pack includes all patches and updates released since the introduction of SUSE
Linux Enterprise 11 in 2009. SUSE adds that Service Pack 3 is an excellent
scale-up choice to migrate resource-intensive workloads that run on RISC/UNIX
systems or for virtualized workloads on the latest AMD Opteron 4000 and 6000
Series Platforms. Also included are support for and improvements in
virtualization and power savings for the latest Intel Xeon E5 processor family
and the fourth-generation Intel Core processor). Service Pack 3 supports large
systems with up to 4096 logical CPUs and 16TiB of system memory.

out how data centers, colocation facilities and network exchange points host a
wide array of critical network, power and server infrastructure from multiple
vendors. The scope and complexity of managing these environments securely and
efficiently continues to grow with faster physical media and
more rigorous security protocols. The Opengear IM7200 is a solution built to
manage all rack infrastructure, even during network downtime. Built for
high-performance remote
management, the solution offers true out-of-band infrastructure management and

Anyware Service's Ametys CMS</h2></div></div><p>
Version 3.5 is the current milestone for Ametys CMS, a Java-based, open-source
multipurpose Web factory that can run corporate Web sites, blogs, portals and
corporate wikis on the same server. Ametys CMS's other strength, says its
producer, lies in its uncommonly intuitive look and feel among open-source CMSes,
which is analogous to Microsoft Office applications. Noteworthy new features in
version 3.5 include expanded content sharing between different sites, a common
resources function, improved user accounts features and a plugin for YouTube
playlists and several back-office tweaks.
