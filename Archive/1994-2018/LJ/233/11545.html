If you follow my columns in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, you
probably are aware
that I'm a big fan of the command line. When it comes to getting things
done efficiently, most of the time the command line can't be beat. This
has led me to integrating services like instant messaging and Twitter
into BitlBee so I can use them with my command-line IRC client Irssi
(both written up in previous <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> issues). 
</p><p>
You probably
also are aware
that unlike some other <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> writers out there (I'm looking
at you Bill Childers), I'm a bit more skeptical of cloud services. That said,
in this day and age, it seems you can't escape cloud services, so what's
a guy like me to do? Well, I've just figured out how to use cloud
services from the comfort of my green-on-black terminal. So, I figured it
might be interesting to write a few articles describing how you can access
various cloud services from the command line.
</p><p>
The first cloud service I thought I'd cover also is one of the most
prevalent: Google Calendar. Although a lot of calendaring options
exist, in a corporate environment, you often are talking about
either Exchange (usually larger, older-school companies) or Google Apps
(usually smaller startups). Google Calendar can be pretty convenient as
a shared calendar, particularly if you are issued an Android device at
work. Plus, like with all major cloud services, you can collaborate and
share your data with other people (like the NSA). My main problem with
Google Calendar always has been having to open up a browser every time
I want to view my calendar. Although I'm sure some people are logged in to
the Gmail Web interface all day and get meeting notifications that way,
I'm not. Because I'm usually glued to my terminal window, I often don't
see those reminders. After missing a few meetings, I decided I needed to
find some way to put meeting notifications inside my terminal.
</p><p>
The 
CLI to Google Calendar that worked for me was gcalcli. It provides
a command-line interface to view your calendar in various formats
and also lets you add events&mdash;all from the command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1373580.0x146b7d0"></a>
Install gcalcli</h2></div></div><p>
gcalcli itself was not packaged for my distribution, so installation took
me a few extra steps. First, I cloned the project's git repository into a
local directory named src that I use to keep track of source code (feel free
to replace this with the directory you use for the same purpose). Then,
I created a symlink to the included script so I could start identifying
what Python libraries I'd need:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ~/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli.git
$ sudo ln -s ~/src/gcalcli/gcalcli /usr/local/bin/gcalcli
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, I tried to launch the application but noticed I was missing
a few required Python libraries, such as gflags, dateutil, httplib2
and google-api-python-client. The first three had Debian packages, so I
was able to install them with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install python-gflags python-dateutil 
 &#8618;python-httplib2
</pre>
</p><p>
The final Python library wasn't packaged in Debian. For better or
worse, it seems just about every modern scripting language has its
own implementation of Perl's CPAN, so I fell back to using Python's pip
(which I first had to install):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ sudo pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1373580.0x146bae8"></a>
Initial Setup</h2></div></div><p>
With all of the libraries in place, you are ready to set up gcalcli to
use your Google account. The first time gcalcli is run, it will set up
your account, but if you are not running it from your local machine,
you will want to add an extra argument the first time you launch it so
it can provide you with a URL to load locally to authorize gcalcli:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcalcli agenda --noauth_local_webserver
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it's set up, you can see your current calendar agenda with the
<tt  >agenda</tt> command (the events have been changed to protect the innocent):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcalcli agenda

Mon Jul 15   9:15am  Space out and stare at screen
            10:00am  Meeting with the Bobs
            11:00am  Remodel Cubical Wall
            11:45am  Lunch at Flinger's
             1:00pm  Meeting with Michael
</pre>
</p><p>
I've found the <tt  >agenda</tt> output to be the most useful for
seeing what's on my plate
for the day; however, you also can use <tt  >calw</tt> and
<tt  >calm</tt> to output ASCII-art-style weekly and monthly calendars, respectively (Figure 1).

Meeting Notifications in Screen</h2></div></div><p>
Having access to my calendar from the command line is handy, but it
still doesn't quite solve my problem of getting notifications so I
don't miss an important meeting. I'm sure many people simply rely on
the pop-up notification in their browsers, but I usually am not looking
at my browser, and when I am, I'm not logged in to Gmail. I am, however,
almost always looking at a screen session, so I found the best approach
for me was to put notifications there.
</p><p>
I wrote about how to set up screen notifications in my February 2011
Hack and / column, so I recommend reading that column if you haven't
set up your hardstatus line yet. Because notifications in screen are simply
scripts that output short lines of text, what I want to do is tell gcalcli
to display the next meeting in my agenda today that hasn't yet started,
or if there are no more meetings today, to display nothing. That way, I
can see at a glance what meeting is next. 
</p><p>
The first step is to create
a basic shell script in my local ~/bin/ directory called gagenda that
calls gcalcli with extra arguments and then parses the results:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcalcli --nocolor --nostarted agenda "`date`" 11:59pm | 
 &#8618;grep -v 'No Events' | head -2 | tail -1 | grep -v '^$'
</pre>
</p><p>
With this long one-liner, I tell gcalcli to show me all of the events
on my agenda that haven't started (<tt  >--nostarted</tt>)
between now (<tt  >"`date`"</tt>)
and 11:59pm. Then if there are no events, I grep that out so I get empty
output. If there are results, I use head and tail to pull out the line I
want. Finally, if the line is empty I also grep that out. The end result
is a single line of output suitable for screen.
</p><p>
Of course, I didn't want to stop there. What I wanted was for regular
events to show up in white on my output, but then as the meeting got
closer, I thought it would be nice if it turned to yellow and then finally
to red. Also, when commands in your screen hardstatus line take a long
time to run, the whole screen session can stall, so my solution was to
have my gagenda script redirect the output to a few temporary files. The
key to having a status appear to change colors is to have different
backtick commands show up in the same location, each assigned its own
color. Then as long as you make sure that only one of the commands will
display output at any time, you get the illusion that you have only one
status that changes color. Here is the resulting gagenda shell script
to accomplish that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

# first look for urgent events occurring 
# in the next five minutes
gcalcli --nocolor --nostarted agenda "`date`" "`date -d 
 &#8618;'now + 5 minutes'`" | grep -v 'No Events' | head -2 | 
 &#8618;tail -1 | grep -v '^$' &gt; /tmp/gagenda-urgent
# if there are no urgent events, look for warning 
# events in the next 10 minutes
if [ ! -s /tmp/gagenda-urgent ]; then
  gcalcli --nocolor --nostarted agenda "`date`" "`date -d 
 &#8618;'now + 10 minutes'`" | grep -v 'No Events' | head -2 | 
 &#8618;tail -1 | grep -v '^$' &gt; /tmp/gagenda-warning
# if there are no warning events, just grab the next 
# event for the day
  if [ ! -s /tmp/gagenda-warning ]; then
    gcalcli --nocolor --nostarted agenda "`date`" 11:59pm | 
 &#8618;grep -v 'No Events' | head -2 | tail -1 | 
 &#8618;grep -v '^$' &gt; /tmp/gagenda
  else
    cat /dev/null &gt; /tmp/gagenda
  fi
else
  cat /dev/null &gt; /tmp/gagenda-warning
  cat /dev/null &gt; /tmp/gagenda
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I edited my local user's crontab with <tt  >crontab -e</tt> to add gagenda:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* *     * * *    /home/greenfly/bin/gagenda
</pre>
</p><p>
To configure screen, I updated my .screenrc with three new backtick
commands that just cat the output of the temporary files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backtick 111 37 37 cat /tmp/gagenda
backtick 112 37 37 cat /tmp/gagenda-warning
backtick 113 37 37 cat /tmp/gagenda-urgent
</pre>
</p><p>
And finally, I referenced those backtick commands with the appropriate
colors in my hardstatus line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hardstatus string '%{= w}%Y-%m-%d %c%{= w}|%{= w}%111`%{+b 
 &#8618;y}%112`%{+b r}%113`%{-}%{= w}|%= |%{+b g}%108`%{-}|%{+b 
 &#8618;b}%105`%{-}|%{= y}%107`%{= w}'
</pre>
</p><p>
The relevant section of the hardstatus line for these commands is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
|%{= w}%111`%{+b y}%112`%{+b r}%113`%{-}%{= w}|
</pre>
</p><p>
Once I reload my .screenrc file, Figure 2 shows that I have an urgent meeting
in a few minutes.

In this article, I just touched on using gcalcli to access your agenda
from the command line, but in my next column, I'll expand on the topic
to talk about how to add new events and do even more with your Google
Calendar without having to leave your terminal.
