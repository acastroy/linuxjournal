Stop making tarballs of your configuration directories&mdash;vcsh gives you
source
control and syncing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b6580.0x15ae1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're anything like me (and don't you want to be?), you probably have more
than one Linux or UNIX machine that you use on a regular basis. Perhaps
you've got a laptop and a desktop. Or, maybe you've got a few servers on which
you have
shell accounts. Managing the configuration files for applications like
mutt, Irssi and others isn't hard, but the administrative overhead just
gets tedious, particularly when moving from one machine to another or setting
up a new machine.
</p><p>
Some time ago, I started using Dropbox to manage and synchronize my
configuration files. What I'd done was create several folders in Dropbox, and
then when I'd set up a new machine, I'd install Dropbox, sync those folders
and create symlinks from the configs in those directories to the desired
configuration file in my home directory. As an example, I'd have a directory
called Dropbox/conf/mutt, with my .muttrc file inside that directory. Then,
I'd create a symlink like <tt  >~/.muttrc -&gt;
Dropbox/conf/mutt/.muttrc</tt>. This
worked, but it quickly got out of hand and became a major pain in the neck to
maintain. Not only did I have to get Dropbox working on Linux, including my
command-line-only server machines, but I also had to ensure that I made a bunch of
symlinks in just the right places to make everything work. The last straw was
when I got a little ARM-powered Linux machine and wanted to get my
configurations on it, and realized that there's no ARM binary for the
Dropbox sync d&aelig;mon. There had to be another way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b6580.0x15ae460"></a>
...and There Was Another Way</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out I'm not the only one who's struggled with this. vcsh developer
Richard Hartmann also had this particular itch, except he came up with a way
to scratch it: vcsh. vcsh is a script that wraps both git and mr into an
easy-to-use tool for configuration file management.
</p><p>
So, by now, I bet you're asking, &ldquo;Why are you using git for this? That sounds
way too complicated.&rdquo; I thought something similar myself, until I actually
started using it and digging in. Using vcsh has several advantages,
once you get your head around the workflow. The first and major advantage to
using vcsh is that all you really need is git, bash and mr&mdash;all of which are
readily available (or can be built relatively easily)&mdash;so there's no
proprietary d&aelig;mons or services required. Another advantage of using vcsh is
that it leverages git's workflow. If you're used to checking in files with
git, you'll feel right at home with vcsh. Also, because git is powering
the whole system, you get the benefit of having your configuration files
under version control, so if you accidentally make an edit to a file that
breaks something, it's very easy to roll back using standard git commands.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b6580.0x15ae670"></a>
Let's Get Started!</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to assume you're on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or higher for this, because it
makes installation easy. A simple <tt  >sudo apt-get install vcsh mr
git</tt> will
install vcsh and its dependencies. If you're on another Linux distro, or some other
UNIX derivative, you may need to check out vcsh and mr, and then build git if
it's not packaged. I'm also going to assume you've got a working git server
installed on another machine, because vcsh really shines for helping keep your
configs synchronized between machines.
</p><p>
Once you've installed vcsh and its dependencies, it's time to start using
vcsh. Let's take a fairly common config file that most everyone who's ever
used a terminal has&mdash;the config file for vim. This file lives in your home
directory, and it's called .vimrc. If you've used vim at all before, this
file will be here. I'm going to show you how to get it checked into a git
repository that is under vcsh's control.
</p><p>
First, run the following command to initialize vcsh's git
repository for vim:



<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test:~$ vcsh init vim
vcsh: info: attempting to create '/home/bill/.config/vcsh/repo.d'
vcsh: info: attempting to create '/home/bill/.gitignore.d'
Initialized empty Git repository in 
 &#8618;/home/bill/.config/vcsh/repo.d/vim.git/
</pre>
</p><p>
I like to think of the &ldquo;fake git repos&rdquo; that vcsh works with to be almost
like chroots (if you're familiar with that concept), as it makes things
easier to work with. You're going to &ldquo;enter a chroot&rdquo;, in a way, by telling
vcsh you want to work inside the fake git repo for vim. This is done with this
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test:~$ vcsh enter vim
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you're going to add the file .vimrc to the repository you created above by
running the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test:~$ git add .vimrc
</pre>
</p><p>
You're using normal git here, but inside the environment managed by vcsh.
This is a design feature of vcsh to make it function very similarly to git.
</p><p>
Now that your file's being tracked by the git repository inside vcsh, let's
commit it by running the following git-like command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test:~$ git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
master (root-commit) bc84953 Initial Commit
 Committer: Bill Childers bill@test.home
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 .vimrc
</pre>
</p><p>
Now for the really cool part. Just like standard git, you can push your files
to a remote repository. This lets you make them available to other machines
with one command. Let's do that now. First, you'll add the remote server. (I
assume you already have a server set up and have the proper accounts
configured. You'll also need a bare git repo on that server.) For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test:~$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:vim.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, push your files to that remote server:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test:~$ git push -u origin master
    Counting objects: 3, done.
    Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 272 bytes, done.
    Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@gitserver:vim.git
    * new branch      master -&gt; master
    Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
bill@test:~$ exit
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the <tt  >exit</tt> line at the end. This exits the
&ldquo;vcsh fake git repo&rdquo;. Now
your .vimrc file is checked in and copied to a remote server! If there are
other programs for which you'd like to check in configurations, like mutt, you 
simply can create a new repo by running <tt  >vcsh init mutt</tt>, and then run through
the process all over again, but this time, check your files into the mutt
repository.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b6580.0x15af010"></a>
Move Your Configuration to Another Machine</h2></div></div><p>
To sync your configuration to another machine, you just need to install vcsh,
git and mr, and then run a similar process as the steps above, except you'll
do a git pull from your server, rather than a push. This is because you don't
have the .vimrc file you want locally, and you want to get it from your
remote git repository.
</p><p>
The commands to do this are:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~$ sudo apt-get install vcsh git mr
bill@test2:~$ vcsh enter vim
bill@test2:~$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:vim.git
bill@test2:~$ git pull -u origin master
From gitserver:vim
* branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
bill@test2:~$ exit
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you've got your checked-in .vimrc file on your second host! This process
works, but it's a little clunky, and it can become unwieldy when you start spawning
multiple repositories. Luckily, there's a tool for this, and it's called
mr.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b6580.0x15af278"></a>
Wrapping It All Up with mr</h2></div></div><p>
If you plan on using multiple repositories with vcsh (and you should&mdash;I'm
tracking 13 repositories at the moment), getting a configuration set up
for mr is essential. What mr brings to the table is a way to manage all the
repositories you're tracking with vcsh. It allows you to enable and
disable repositories simply by adjusting one symlink per repository, and it
also gives you the ability to update all your repos simply by running one
easy command: <tt  >mr up</tt>.
</p><p>
Perhaps the best way to get started using mr is to clone the repo that the
vcsh author provides. This is done with the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~$ vcsh clone 
 &#8618;git://github.com/RichiH/vcsh_mr_template.git mr
Initialized empty Git repository in 
 &#8618;/home/bill/.config/vcsh/repo.d/mr.git/
remote: Counting objects: 19, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Total 19 (delta 1), reused 15 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (19/19), done.
From git://github.com/RichiH/vcsh_mr_template
* new branch      master     -&gt; origin/master
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you've got your mr repo cloned, you'll want to go in and edit the
files to point to your setup. The control files for mr live in
~/.config/mr/available.d, so go to that directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/available.d$ ls
mr.vcsh  zsh.vcsh
</pre>
</p><p>
Rename the zsh.vcsh file to vim.vcsh, because you're working with vim,
and change the repository path to point to your server:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/available.d$ mv zsh.vcsh vim.vcsh
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/available.d$ vi vim.vcsh
[$HOME/.config/vcsh/repo.d/vim.git]
checkout = vcsh clone git@gitserver:vim.git vim
</pre>
</p><p>
Also, edit the mr.vcsh file to point to your server as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/available.d$ vi mr.vcsh
[$HOME/.config/vcsh/repo.d/mr.git]
checkout = vcsh clone git@gitserver:mr.git mr
</pre>
</p><p>
The mr tool relies on symlinks from the available.d directory to the config.d
directory (much like Ubuntu's Apache configuration, if you're familiar with
that). This is how mr determines which repositories to sync. Since you've
created a vim repo, make a symlink to tell mr to sync the vim repo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/available.d$ cd ../config.d
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/config.d$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 bill bill 22 Jun 11 18:14 mr.vcsh -&gt; 
 &#8618;../available.d/mr.vcsh
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/config.d$ ln -s 
 &#8618;../available.d/vim.vcsh vim.vcsh
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/config.d$ ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 bill bill 22 Jun 11 18:14 mr.vcsh -&gt; 
 &#8618;../available.d/mr.vcsh
lrwxrwxrwx 1 bill bill 23 Jun 11 20:51 vim.vcsh -&gt; 
 &#8618;../available.d/vim.vcsh
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, set up mr to be able to sync to your git server:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~/.config/mr/config.d$ cd ../..
bill@test2:~/.config$ vcsh enter mr
bill@test2:~/.config$ ls
mr  vcsh
bill@test2:~/.config$ git add mr
bill@test2:\~/.config$ git commit -m 'Initial Commit'
[master fa4eb18] Initial Commit
Committer: Bill Childers [bill@test2.home]
3 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
create mode 100644 .config/mr/available.d/vim.vcsh
create mode 120000 .config/mr/config.d/vim.vcsh
bill@test2:\~/.config$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:mr.git
fatal: remote origin already exists.
</pre>
</p><p>
Oh no! Why does the remote origin exist already? It's because you cloned the
repo from the author's repository. Remove it, then create your own:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@test2:~/.config$ git remote show
origin
bill@test2:~/.config$ git remote rm origin
bill@test2:~/.config$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:mr.git
bill@test2:~/.config$ git push -u origin master
Counting objects: 28, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
Writing objects: 100% (28/28), 2.16 KiB, done.
Total 28 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@gitserver:mr.git
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master
Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
bill@test2:~/.config$ exit
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it! However, now that mr is in the mix, all you need to do to set up a
new machine is do a <tt  >vcsh clone git@gitserver:mr.git mr</tt> to clone your mr
repository, then do an <tt  >mr up</tt>, and that machine will have all your repos
automatically.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
vcsh is a very powerful shell tool, and one that takes some time to adapt
your thought processes to. However, once you do it, it makes setting up a new
machine (or account on a machine) a snap, and it also gives you a way to
keep things in sync easily. It's saved me a lot of time in the past few
months, and it's allowed me to recover quickly from a bad configuration
change I've made. Check it out for yourself!

Setting up a Remote Git Repo</b></p><p>
A quick note on setting up a remote git repo: you'll need to set up
passwordless authentication using SSH keys (see Resources for
more information). Once you have that going using a &ldquo;git&rdquo; user, you simply
need to create a git repo as the git user. That's done easily enough, just run
the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git@gitserver:~$ git init --bare vim.git

</p><p>
Your bare repo will be ready for your vcsh client to check in stuff!
