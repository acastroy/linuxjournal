A peek into Shawn's toy box.

Since my &ldquo;Trying to Tame the Tablet&rdquo; article was published in the February
2013 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I've been
getting a steady stream of e-mail messages asking about what tools and programs I
use on a daily basis. Because this is our How-To issue, I figured it would
be appropriate to give a rundown on how I do the things I do. I must
warn you though, I'm not going to pull any punches&mdash;I use multiple operating
systems every day. Thankfully, Linux is still king, so I'll try to keep
my other dallyings to a minimum.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c96580.0x1d8e5c0"></a>
The Hardware&mdash;Desk</h2></div></div><p>
I have two main workspaces in my office. The first is for my day job,
which requires me to use a giant Wacom monitor and Windows 7. I do Linux
training during the day, so that Windows 7 machine has about a dozen
Linux VMs and uses Camtasia for recording.
</p><p>
Everything else I do is at my personal workspace. That's the area
I focus on here, because it's the place I've configured exactly
the way I like. Figure 1 shows my workspace. The chair is just a cheap
office chair from an office supply store. You'll notice there aren't any
armrests on the chair, which is because I took them off (Figure
2). Armrests annoy me while I work, and if I'm doing any recording, I
find the headphone/microphone cables get tangled. Plus, I sometimes sit
cross-legged in my office chair, and that's not possible with armrests
in the way.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11553f1.large.jpg"><img src="11553f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. This chair isn't fancy, but it works.
</p></div></div><p>
The computer I use was purchased based on the TonyMac Hackintosh Mini-Mac
build (<a href="http://snar.co/customac" target="_self">snar.co/customac</a>). My hardware is actually from last
year's recommendations, but it still is able to dual-boot OS X 10.8.4
and Xubuntu 13.04. I'm very fond of Apple's Chiclet-style keyboard,
so I'm using that and a Magic Mouse for input.
</p><p>
For simple recording or VoIP calls, I use my wireless Plantronics CS50 USB
headset. The software for the device is Windows-only, but as a headset
and microphone, it works just fine. I think the button on the side is a
gimmick anyway, so I'm not upset by the lack of software support. If I'm
recording something where sound quality matters, I have a Sennheiser USB
headset and microphone combo. The model I use is long discontinued,
but I love the quality of every Sennheiser I've ever owned.
</p><p>
My monitor is just a 24" 1080p monitor I got from <a href="http://woot.com" target="_self">woot.com</a> for $350. My
dream monitor is the 30" Dell Ultrasharp, but so far, Santa Claus hasn't
brought me one. I'm connecting to the computer via DVI, but only because
I couldn't find an HDMI cable in &ldquo;the big box of tangled
cable&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Currently, I don't have a printer. It's not due to my desire to
go paperless, but rather because, like a fool, I went back to an inkjet
printer a year ago, and it's been problematic ever since. My hatred for
inkjets has been renewed 1000%. Because this article is meant to reflect
my work environment, I can tell you that I hope to purchase a Brother
color laser printer soon. I've had wonderful luck with Brother printers
through the years, and they always seem to have decent Linux support. I
haven't chosen a model number yet, but it will be a Brother for sure. (I'm
trying to decide whether I should buy the multifunction machine with a FAX,
or just let the old technology die. The problem is, I still need a FAX
from time to time.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c96580.0x1d8ed50"></a>
The Hardware&mdash;Mobile</h2></div></div><p>
My mobile hardware recently has undergone a change, at least partially. My
last job provided an iPhone, so that was what I used for years. My new
training job allowed me to get whatever type of phone I wanted, so I
chose the Samsung Galaxy S4. I tend to use my smartphone a lot during the
day, so even with the S4's impressive power management, I had to buy an
oversized battery. I bought the Hyperion 5200mAh battery (<a href="http://snar.co/s4battery" target="_self">snar.co/s4battery</a>), which came with
a custom phone back to fit the bulge. Hyperion also offers a case to fit
the bulging phone, so I bought that as well (<a href="http://snar.co/s4case" target="_self">snar.co/s4case</a>). It certainly isn't as svelte
as the out-of-the-box S4, but I think it's less bulky than my old iPhone
with the Mophie Juicepack (Figure 3). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11553f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The blue matches my car. So does the size.
</p></div></div><p>
I do still have my Google Nexus 7 tablet, whose original tale inspired
this article. I've purchased at least five cases for that tablet, ranging
from a neoprene sleeve to a Bluetooth keyboard case. In the end, I've
defaulted to using a simple clamshell case.
I also have the same
stylus mentioned in the earlier article, and although I don't write with it,
I find the precision of using a stylus helpful at times. (Crayon Physics,
I'm looking at you.)
</p><p>
For the past ten years or so, my daily driver laptop has been a MacBook
Pro, because that's what was provided by my employer. (No, not <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>!) I don't have a work-provided laptop anymore, so I spend my
couch-surfing time largely with the computer I'm typing on right now:
the same Dell D420 I was given by a reader when our house burned down
four years ago. It's been upgraded with a PATA SSD and a new battery,
but this laptop has been faithful for years, and now as my full-time
machine, I have no complaints. It's showing its age in that the screen
hinges are loose, but that's truly my only complaint.
</p><p>
I also have a Samsung Chromebook (the ARM-based one Bill Childers reviewed
in the July 2013 issue), and although my original plan was to use that as
my main computer, my kids have had other plans. They use my Chromebook
constantly, and I rarely get to play with it. If you wonder whether
a Chromebook would be a good fit for your kids, given my experience, the
answer is
a hearty <span   class="emphasis"><em>yes</em></span>.
</p><p>
I do still have my old Samsung Galaxy S2 phone, which no longer has cell
service. I've been using it as an audiobook player and GPS in my car. I
keep the audiobooks updated by having FolderSync (an Android app) 
run over Wi-Fi from the driveway overnight. As long as
I route my trip while still in the driveway, Google Maps seems to cache
the entire trip without the need for a constant data connection. If I
need to route a new trip while away from the house, I just activate the
mobile hotspot on my S4 and leave it on long enough to create the map
cache. So far, it's been a good solution, and it keeps my phone in my
pocket so I don't leave it in the car.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c96580.0x1d8f2d0"></a>
The Mobile Software</h2></div></div><p>
Let me start with my mobile devices. For the software section, I'll lump my
laptops in with my desktop, because they use the same applications. My
phones and laptops, being Android, run separate programs. Here's a list
of things I regularly use:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Candy Crush Saga</em></span>: yes, I'm addicted, I'll admit. I resisted for a long
time, because I didn't want to connect to Facebook and pollute my timeline
with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Candy Crush</em></span> requests. It turns out, if you don't connect to Facebook,
you still can keep playing by completing quests. If you've never tried
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Candy Crush</em></span>, I'm not sure whether I should recommend
it. You <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span>
become addicted. (I'm currently on level 133, and I've never purchased
anything in the game, nor do I plan to.)
</p></li><li><p>
Kindle: I've tried many e-book readers on many different platforms. The
Kindle interface isn't my favorite, but I love the cross-device
Whispersync, and I find E Ink to be my favorite for long reads. Because I can
read a chapter or two on my phone, then continue reading on my Kindle
keyboard (Wi-Fi-only) later that night, it's become my go-to reading
app. Now that Whispersync works for personal documents, Kindle doesn't
even annoy me anymore.
</p></li><li><p>
Gas Buddy: this was more useful when we lived in Grand Rapids, Michigan, because
gas prices could vary 20&ndash;25 cents a gallon at stations just a couple miles
apart. Now that we're back in Small-Town USA, I don't use this as often,
because the prices always are the same.
</p></li><li><p>
LED Flashlight: I can't believe how much I use this app. I think I
use it more now than ever before, because it's possible to launch from
my phone's lockscreen. I've always found flashlight apps cumbersome to
find and start, but no more. I really do use this every day, sometimes
several times a day.
</p></li><li><p>
Camera: I try to take funny photos as often as I can. Like everyone else
on the planet, now I have a camera in my pocket. Like the flashlight,
the ability to launch the camera from the lockscreen makes it more
convenient, and more used.
</p></li><li><p>
Google Music: I don't listen to music often, but I keep a few albums on
Google Music, because I know I can reach it anywhere. I most often use it
to play a Jonathan Coulton song for someone who's never heard it before.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>: I honestly don't use the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> app very often. By
the time the issues go live, I've already been reading through them during
the entire production process. I keep the app for the same reason I use
Google Music though&mdash;to show others cool things!
</p></li><li><p>
Yaste: we lose our television remote more often than I care to
admit. Yaste is a great XBMC remote. It's not as nice as using the
regular MCE remote, but it's usually easier to find.
</p></li><li><p>
Dock Clock: I haven't had a clock radio in years, but I still miss the
large digital time next to my bed. Dock Clock automatically activates
when I plug in the charger, and it allows me to create the clock radio feel
while still using the far-superior cell-phone alarm system (Figure 5).
</p></li><li><p>
Google Mail: well, yeah. I almost forgot to include it, but I use
it constantly.
</p></li><li><p>
Chrome: Same here. I almost didn't include it, but I realize there are
other Web browsers, and not everyone uses Chrome. The only annoyance
I have is that there's no way to enable the &ldquo;bookmark bar&rdquo; like in the
desktop version of Chrome. I understand it would be cramped on my phone,
but on the tablet, it would be awesome.
</p></li><li><p>
Smart Audiobook Player: Best. Audiobook. Player. Ever. I love everything
about Smart Audiobook Player. I listen to most books at 1.4x or 1.5x
depending on the narrator, and I don't notice any &ldquo;chipmunk&rdquo; effect at
all. I do have the Audible app too, but I try my best to use straight
up MP3 files for audiobooks and sync them with FolderSync.
</p></li><li><p>
Social media: I'm a social-media junkie, so I have Twitter, Facebook,
FourSquare, Instagram, SnapChat, Flickr and G+. I usually initiate most
things with Twitter, but try to respond on most networks.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11553f4.large.jpg"><img src="11553f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

The Desktop Software</h2></div></div><p>
These days, most of my desktop applications are really just Web
apps. There are a few native apps that I can't live without though:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pithos: this plays music from the Pandora network. It works flawlessly,
and I love it. If I ever want to hear some music, I usually just turn
on Pithos, because my personal music collection is rather small.
</p></li><li><p>
TextRoom: in a pinch, I still use the Chrome app Writebox, but for
most writing (like what I'm doing now), I still use TextRoom. For a while,
it was difficult to use, because it wouldn't install on modern Ubuntu
versions. Thankfully, a man named Otto has created a PPA for TextRoom
that works perfectly. I owe Otto a beverage of his choosing!
</p></li><li><p>
Dropbox: thanks to my Chromebook, I now have more than 100GB of space in
Google Drive. I've been using Dropbox for so long, however, that it's
hard to switch. Perhaps the program I mention in this issue's UpFront
section, Insync, will
help me transition, but for the present, my 24GB of Dropbox is where I
keep most of my writing.
</p></li><li><p>
Calibre: I have a fairly large collection of e-books, and without
Calibre, they'd be a mess. Calibre has plugins for automatically sending
books to my Kindle account, so I find myself using it often.
</p></li><li><p>
Chromium: this really ends the list of native apps I use regularly. I'll
occasionally play a game or something, but not very often. Everything
else I use regularly is a Chrome extension or plugin.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c96580.0x2188ac8"></a>
Web Apps</h2></div></div><p>
One of the reasons I love Chrome/Chromium/Chromebooks is that extensions
sync just like bookmarks. If I install an app on my laptop, it's waiting
for me when I go back to my desk&mdash;even if that desk is running a different
operating system! Here are the apps I use regularly:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
MightyText: now that my family has iOS devices and I don't, we can't
use iMessage to talk to each other. Thankfully, MightyText brings texting
to my browser, so while I'm at a keyboard, I can text at full speed.
</p></li><li><p>
Evernote: I don't use Evernote as much as I did when I was working
in an office setting as a manager, but I still use it as a knowledge
repository. The Web app is really nice, and it's usually all I need.
</p></li><li><p>
Lastpass: I forced myself to migrate all my passwords to Lastpass,
and now that I use it all the time, I've come to love it. I'll admit,
I didn't care for it at first.
</p></li><li><p>
Tweetdeck: I've been on a quest to find the best Twitter client
since my beloved Twhirl died away. I haven't found one I love,
but Tweetdeck's Chrome app comes the closest.
</p></li><li><p>
CommaFeed: my Google Reader replacement, mentioned in the UpFront
section of this very issue.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c96580.0x2188f98"></a>
Green and Black</h2></div></div><p>
If Kyle Rankin wrote this article, every application would be replaced
with a CLI equivalent. Although I have amazing respect for Kyle's way
of computing, I also like shiny things. Still, there are quite a few
applications I rely on that have nothing more than green text and a
black screen:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
vim: you know you're a vim user when you are annoyed by
&ldquo;easier&rdquo; text
editors like nano. I can open, edit and save a file quicker than most
people can find Ctrl-x on their keyboard to exit nano.
</p></li><li><p>
Irssi: for IRC chatting, it's hard to beat Irssi. For me, this isn't
because I prefer the Irssi interface. Truth be told, I prefer the way
Pidgin handles IRC. I like to stay logged in to IRC all the time, however,
so I can respond to questions posed while I'm away. The screen command
coupled with Irssi accomplishes that for me.
</p></li><li><p>
SSH: truly, truly the Swiss-Army knife on the command line. Remote
shells, tunneling traffic, remote/reverse tunneling, keypair
authentication, file copying...SSH is amazing. I use it every day,
all day long.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c96580.0x21893b8"></a>
Now for the Interactive Part of Our Show...</h2></div></div><p>
So there you have it. That's my computing world in a nutshell. Perhaps
you see something helpful, or perhaps you're appalled at my lack of
tool usage. Either way, I'd love to hear from you. In fact, if you have
a unique application or method for accomplishing your day-to-day tasks,
send me an e-mail! I love to highlight new or cool (preferably both)
applications or Web sites in our UpFront section. If you send me something
awesome, and we publish it, I'll be sure to give you credit for the
heads-up. Just drop me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> and put something
like &ldquo;[MY WAY]&rdquo; in the subject. I can't wait to hear how everyone computes!
