    Mr. Phillips discusses some history as well as what's
    happening now in the Linux Csound world.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x16083a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Csound is a music composition and sound
programming language originally written by Barry Vercoe at MIT. As
Nick Bailey pointed out in his October 1998 <i  >LJ</i>
article &ldquo;Sculptor: A Real Time Phase Vocoder&rdquo;, Barry's original
MUSIC11 program was eventually ported from PDP-11 assembler to UNIX
C, where it became Csound. MUSIC11 was derived from the pioneering
MusicV program by Max Mathews, perhaps the most revered &ldquo;Founding
Father&rdquo; of computer music technology.
</p><p>One of MusicV's major innovations was the implementation of
the unit generator, a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; concept that allowed great
extensibility to the language. A unit generator can be a signal
generator or modifier, a patching opcode, a sensor, or it can
provide sound file I/O and signal display types. Csound has evolved
into a notable successor to Music V, quickly accommodating new
synthesis methods and DSP algorithms. It is now at the cutting edge
of modern computer music software. Linux Csound has done more than
simply kept pace with that evolution&mdash;it offers capabilities not
found with versions available on other platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1608558"></a>Enter Linux</h2></div></div><p>In 1996, I wanted to try out the Linux OS. I knew certain
software synthesis languages would run under it, and those
languages were not available for DOS/Windows machines. Although
Csound does indeed run under Microsoft operating systems (and many
others), I was interested in seeing how well it would run under
Linux. Jonathan Mohr had already added the real-time audio support
for Linux, but I immediately discovered I had stumbled upon another
big &ldquo;DIY&rdquo; (do it yourself) project. The source code available
from the Bath, UK FTP site (the primary repository for the
&ldquo;canonical&rdquo; packages) was a general UNIX package, without
Linux-specific Makefiles or any other compilation amenities.
Although I was a novice at both Linux and the C programming
language, I jumped in and started thrashing. With good assistance
from John Fitch (maintainer of the Bath site and the canonical
sources) and the helpful members of the Csound mail list, I finally
produced a working set of Makefiles for the entire source tree. I
soon had a fast Linux Csound with full support for X displays,
real-time audio output and all the current opcodes. Professor
Burton Beerman kindly provided an FTP site for my Linux Csound
packages on his MusTec server at Bowling Green State University,
and for two years I maintained the public version on that site and
at Bath.</p><p><a href="3187s2.html" target="_self">CSound in a Nutshell</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1608710"></a>Linux CSound: the Plot Thickens</h2></div></div><p>Early in 1998, I received a message from Professor Nicola
Bernardini at AIMI (Associazione di Informatica Musicale Italiana).
He had thoroughly rewritten the Linux Csound Makefiles and wondered
if I might be interested in adding them to the source package. His
offer came at a good time, as I knew the code maintenance needed a
more solid structure. Nicola's expertise was just the right factor
appearing at just the right moment. His Makefiles enabled me to
quickly prepare a variety of distribution packages (with or without
X support, static build or shared lib, real-time audio
enabled/disabled, etc.) and compile a more complete build of the
source tree. Most importantly, the Makefiles created libcsound.so,
a shared library which drastically reduced the binary's memory
footprint (from about 450KB to less than 20KB).</p><p><a href="3187s3.html" target="_self">Real-time Linux
CSound</a></p><p>Around the same time, developer Gabriel Maldonado wrote a set
of MIDI output opcodes, allowing Csound to be used as a MIDI
composition/control instrument. Csound already accommodated MIDI
input, directly from /dev/midi or from a Type 0 Standard MIDI File
(see <a href="3187s4.html" target="_self">Real-time Midi Input</a>).
Gabriel's opcodes are different: they permit exploration into MIDI
composition algorithms simultaneously with the rest of Csound's
real-time I/O. Hypothetically, it would be possible to have a MIDI
device controlling one Csound instrument while another instrument
sends its output to <b  >devaudio</b>. Given support for
a full-duplex sound card, it should even be possible to have
asynchronous I/O for both the MIDI and the audio ports.</p><p>Alas, no routines had been written for Linux Csound that
would accept the data from Gabriel's opcodes and send it out to the
MIDI port. After studying John Fitch's code for the Windows Csound
MIDI output handler, I decided to try writing the appropriate calls
for Linux. I fumbled around with the OSS/Free API and eventually
wrote the code needed to activate the requested MIDI interface and
accept the control data sent to it from the Maldonado opcodes.
Linux Csound was as up-to-date as any other version, and the
necessary code for MIDI output had been trivial to write,
consisting primarily of a few calls to the sound card API
macros.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1608a28"></a>The CVS Repository</h2></div></div><p>The next major step taken for Linux Csound was the
establishment of a CVS repository. I had been complaining to Nicola
that I found myself constantly checking everything coming to me in
the canonical UNIX package, when he suggested the need for a
revision control system. He volunteered to set it up at AIMI and
after some trial-and-error hacking, he established the system we
work with today. The CVS repository maintains separate directories
for the canonical sources and the Linux-specific code. In this way,
we can avoid rewriting sources just for Linux and we are always
able to refer back to the &ldquo;untouched&rdquo; originals. Anonymous access
to the CVS is permitted, but submissions for changes are carefully
screened by the maintainer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1608b30"></a>The Csound UNIX/Linux Development Group</h2></div></div><p>Of course, a CVS development repository isn't of much use
unless it has developers contributing, so a logical next step was
the formation of the Csound UNIX Development group. Programmers
Robin Whittle and Damien Miller joined in immediately, and Damien
kindly provided a web page with all pertinent information for
anyone interested in joining the group. It is worth noting that the
group is for development, not just developers. We welcome anyone
interested in seeing Linux Csound grow into the finest language of
its kind. Programmers are certainly welcome, but so are musicians,
audiophiles, DSP engineers and anyone else with an interest in
Csound and its possibilities.</p><p>In October 1998, two new members made significant
contributions to the group's activities. Gabriel Maldonado donated
his entire source tree to the CVS repository, which enables Linux
Csound to keep up with the developments for his Windows versions.
(This generosity is quite typical of the Csound community. Much
code sharing occurs on the Csound mail list, with new instrument
designs freely offered, along with much healthy debate over various
computer music issues.) The other signal addition has been Fred
Floberg, whose contributions require special description.</p><p>Csound's internal support for real-time audio has been
dependent on calls to the API for the OSS sound-card drivers. While
certainly sufficient for casual use, many sonic notions such as
full-duplex and multiplexed real-time audio I/O are not realizable
by the OSS/Free driver. However, the ALSA driver does indeed
support those uses; thanks to code from Fred Floberg, Linux Csound
now explicitly supports the ALSA interface. (The ALSA project, led
by Jaroslav Kycela, is forming a new extended sound system API
compatible with OSS/Free, but permitting much more advanced uses
for sound-card features not supported by OSS/Free.) Fred is
currently working on expanding MIDI file support. Csound now
supports only Type 0 MIDI files, but Linux Csound should soon
support the Type 1 and perhaps even the Type 2 Standard MIDI File
formats.</p><p>Also, thanks to Robin and Damien, the Linux Csound
distribution now supports the popular RPM packaging and can be
built for glibc (libc6) systems. Debian users will be pleased to
note that developer G&lt;\#252&gt;nter Geiger has prepared a
package in the DEB format. Finally, Nicola Bernardini has written a
Csound orchestra (instrument design) parser, which we hope will
eventually be absorbed into the package. Such a utility is most
helpful to a GUI designer, which brings me to my next topic: the
power of Linux Csound and X.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1608d40"></a>The X Picture</h2></div></div><p>My Linux soundapps web page shows more than twenty entries in
the &ldquo;Csound Helpers&rdquo; section. The brief descriptions which follow
are just that&mdash;brief descriptions which in no way indicate the full
power of these applications. The examples shown here are for Linux
systems running X; some excellent command-line utilities exist too
and are included on the Linux soundapps page for those tools. All
of these utilities work with the current versions of Linux Csound
(3.47 or higher).</p><p>Note that each of these applications was built using freely
available tools. The GNU C and C++ compilers, Tcl/Tk, Java, LessTif
and WINE are powerful allies in the advancement of Linux sound and
MIDI software. Their developers are to be commended for the
wonderful work they have done for the good of the Linux
community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1608ea0"></a>Cecilia</h2></div></div><p>Cecilia (by Jean Piche and Alexandre Burton at the University
of Montr&eacute;al) is a fully-developed Csound composition and
sound-processing environment. Written entirely in Tcl/Tk, Cecilia
utilizes the entire range of possibilities afforded by Linux
Csound, presenting a beautiful graphic interface (customizable, of
course) and a powerful composition language (Cybil). Numerous
real-time controls are supported, nearly all aspects of the program
are user-definable, excellent on-line help is available and the GUI
fully exploits Tk in the X environment. Cecilia won first place in
the awards for computer-aided composition and realization software
at the 1997 Second International Music Software Competition in
Bourges. (See Figure 1.)</p><p><a href="3187f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.

<span   class="bold"><b>rain</b></span>, a GIF-to-Csound score
converter. A Csound score is the control file for a Csound
instrument, providing it with such values as event start times,
durations, amplitudes and frequencies, waveform selection and so
forth. Matti's utility simply takes a GIF image, applies some
user-defined values and magically translates it into a Csound
score. The score can then be synthesized and played from within the
application, or it can be saved to disk for later processing
(perhaps in Cecilia). (See Figure 2.)</p><p><a href="3187f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Rain</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1609318"></a>Adsyn</h2></div></div><p>Adsyn is a graphic editor for Csound &ldquo;hetro&rdquo; analysis data
files. <span   class="bold"><b>hetro</b></span> is one of the Csound
sound file utility programs and its operation is quite simple.
Using a heterodyne filter bank, it analyzes a sound file and
creates a data file of separated frequency and amplitude values.
That data file can be read and graphically represented by Adsyn and
the frequency and amplitude components can be freely altered using
the mouse. Csound's resynthesis opcode (adsyn) can be called; the
edited file can then be synthesized and played from within Adsyn.
Professor Oyvind Hammer originally wrote Adsyn for SGI machines at
NoTAM, a Norwegian center for music and acoustics research. With
his good graces, I began the port to Linux. It was finished with
much assistance from Nicola Bernardini. (See Figure 3.)</p><p><a href="3187f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.

Ceres, described in my September 1998 <i  >LJ</i>
article &ldquo;Porting SGI Audio Applications to Linux&rdquo;. Johnathan
greatly extended the editing capabilities of the original software
engine, which essentially performs a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
on a sound file and renders a graphic representation of its
frequency content and activity. The graphic display can be edited
in various ways, a large number of transforms (spectral mutations)
are available, up to three graphic linear control functions may be
specified and a variety of output formats are supported, including
two types of Csound scores. Ceres2 also extends some of the
command-line analysis variables such as FFT size, analysis window
size and window overlap. The Linux port was done by me, but it was
dependent on work already done on the original Ceres with great
help from Richard Kent, who also supplied the invaluable tichstuff
libraries which replace the SGI libs. (See Figure 4.)</p><p><a href="3187f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.

common-practice music notation display and the very nice feature of
being able to save your work as a Csound score file. Such a tool is
especially helpful for users most comfortable with standard
notation conventions, allowing them to compose with their familiar
symbols and then easily convert their creations for use with Csound
instruments. (See Figure 5.)</p><p><a href="3187f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.

creation of platform-neutral user interfaces. Jean-Pierre Lemoine's
HPKComposer is an excellent example of a &ldquo;pure Java&rdquo; application,
running under Windows, Mac OS and UNIX variants. Preparation for
Linux is straightforward, depending upon successful installation of
the Java development environment (JDK) in version 1.1.6 or higher,
the Swing class libraries (version 1.1 beta3) from Sun Microsystems
and Csound. HPKComposer blends aspects of the CMask program with
the synthesis and DSP methods of Csound: tendency masks are used to
create composition algorithms, which are realized by the synthesis
engines (opcodes) of Csound. VRML displays are supported, the
program is user-extensible, and although Java's current sound
support is limited to 8-bit 8 kHz audio, when JDK 1.2 arrives it
will support 16-bit 44.1 kHz CD-quality sound. (See Figure
6.)</p><p><a href="3187f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.

&ldquo;patcher&rdquo; for the design of Csound instruments. Although a
UNIX/Linux version of this program exists (XPatchWork), it has not
been maintained and is in need of some serious debugging. However,
the Linux WINE Windows emulator can run the Win95 version, proving
once again that Linux always finds a way. (See Figure 7.)</p><p><a href="3187f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.

opcodes with the general Csound community, one of which is called
&ldquo;space&rdquo;. In the Csound manual entry for space is a mention of a
GUI for creating the values needed by the GEN28 stored-function
table, and SoundSpace is that GUI. Written in core Java, this
unique utility provides a visual interface for determining the
placement and sonic trajectories of up to 8 sound files in the
auditory space, with support for stereo and 4-channel output. (See
Figure 8.)</p><p><a href="3187f8.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 8.
SoundSpace</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1a02278"></a>Into the Future</h2></div></div><p>What is still to come? By the time this article is published,
I hope to have some more Csound/Java applications running.
Developer Michael Gogins has expressed great interest in seeing his
&ldquo;Silence&rdquo; Csound environment running under Linux Java, and the
prestigious IRCAM Music and Sound Research Center announced that a
Linux version of their MAX for Java will be available at the end of
1998. Who knows; maybe someday I'll get around to completing my
Tcl/Tk clone of Csounder, the popular Csound &ldquo;launcher&rdquo; for
Windows (or at least get it working better under WINE).</p><p>The most recent versions of Linux Csound (3.49.xx and up) can
be built for use on the 64-bit DEC Alpha. Thanks to developer Ed
Hall, Linux Csound can claim to be the first 64-bit music and sound
composition language widely and freely available to the
public.</p><p>Nicola Bernardini continues to improve the distribution
packaging: building Linux Csound is easier than ever, thanks to his
incorporation of the <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span>
utility. Work proceeds on accommodating
<span   class="bold"><b>autoconf</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>automake</b></span>, since it is a primary
objective to use the best tools available for creating the best
possible distribution.</p><p>One of the intriguing problems facing the development group
is how to make Csound re-entrant, enabling a plug-in architecture
for Csound. To many of us, such an undertaking would mean a
complete rewrite of Csound, and who knows where that might
lead&mdash;&ldquo;Son of Linux Csound&rdquo;, perhaps? If you would like to join a
very interesting distributed development project, take a look at
the links listed in Resources and feel free to join the development
group mail lists.</p><p>Richard Boulanger is a professor at the Music Synthesis
Department of the Berklee College of Music. In the spring of 1999,
his Csound book will at last be published by MIT Press. On one of
the included CDs, you will find an article (which will, of course,
be out of date by then) about running Csound under Linux. Yes, it
was written by me, but I don't mention it to blow my own horn. This
book is a massive tome and it includes contributions from all the
major (and some not-so-major) members of the international Csound
community. It should inspire many new users, several of whom will
discover for the first time that Csound is available on the Linux
platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1510580.0x1a025e8"></a>Final Words</h2></div></div><p>Linux Csound offers terrific possibilities for real-time
computer music performance. Along with advances in real-time
support, Linux Csound can be expected to stay at the cutting edge
of synthesis methodologies, interface design, DSP algorithms and
composition strategies. It is an ideal tool for contemporary sonic
exploration and it demonstrates once again the flexibility and
power of Linux, the cutting edge OS for the modern musician.</p><p><a href="3187s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
