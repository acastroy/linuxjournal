    The beginning of it all....

the user typing his user name at a prompt that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
login:
</pre><p>In this article, I will explain a little about what really happens
behind the scenes and what contortions the system goes through to
get a user going.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x157d580.0x16755b0"></a>A Bit about the Shell</h2></div></div><p>First, a quick look at the shell. The shell, which is just a
program like any other, reads the characters you type and looks for
a program with the same name. Program names are typed at the prompt
and executed by the shell. Ending a command line with the
<b  >&amp;</b> character causes the command to be run in
the background.</p><p>The shell runs a program in two steps. First, the shell does
an operation called a &ldquo;fork&rdquo;. Forking creates a new process that
looks just like the original process, inheriting many attributes of
its parent such as any open files and user ID. Although it is an
exact copy of the shell program, the &ldquo;child&rdquo; process does not
read user commands. The child shell immediately does an operation
called an &ldquo;exec&rdquo;, short for &ldquo;execute&rdquo;, in which it causes the
Linux kernel to load the new program over the top of the child
shell and run that program in its place.</p><p>At this point, the original shell simply waits for the child
program to finish. Once done, it gets the next line of input from
the user, then the whole procedure is repeated. In an active UNIX
system, this sort of thing is happening all the time. Even on
fairly inactive systems, processes are still run to do housekeeping
chores, while others are simply sleeping and waiting for something
to happen.</p><p>From the <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> shell, you can
see how <span   class="bold"><b>exec</b></span> works by
typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
exec ls -l
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command runs as
usual, but when it is done, you are no longer logged in. The shell
is replaced by ls, and when it finishes, it is as if your shell had
finished.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x157d580.0x16759d0"></a>How Does it All Get Started?</h2></div></div><p>When the kernel is first loaded into memory, it initializes
itself and any hardware that may be attached to the computer. Once
the kernel is established enough to be able to run programs, it
does. The first program is called &ldquo;init&rdquo;; its job is to function
as the ancestor of all processes.</p><p>When <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> starts, it reads a
file called inittab, usually located in /etc. This file tells init
which programs should be run under which conditions. Not only does
init run the startup scripts that bring the rest of the system up,
but init also takes care of shutting the system down.</p><p>One of the responsibilities of init is running the programs
that let users log into the system. For a terminal (or virtual
console), the two programs used are
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> is short for &ldquo;get
terminal&rdquo;. A basic getty program opens the terminal device,
initializes it, prints <b  >login:</b> and waits for a
user name to be entered. Modern getty programs (several are
available for Linux) can do other things as well&mdash;if the terminal
device is a (recent) modem, they can read status codes sent by the
modem to tell if the call is voice or fax and handle the call
appropriately. Most of the time, though, someone just wants to log
in, so getty executes the login program, giving the user name to
log in via the command line.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span> program then
prompts the user for a password. If the password is wrong, login
simply exits. The init process then notices that one of its
children has exited and spawns another getty process on the
terminal in question. If the password is good, login changes its
process user ID to that of the user and executes the user's shell.
At this point, the user can type commands. When the user exits by
typing the shell's built-in <span   class="bold"><b>logout</b></span>
command, the shell exits and init notices that its child has exited
and spawns another getty on the terminal.</p><p>Why are two separate programs used to log in instead of just
one? The answer is that doing it this way provides more
flexibility. For example, getty doesn't have to execute login&mdash;it
can execute a program to receive (or send) faxes, a PPP daemon to
emulate a network connection over a serial line, or if you have a
modem with &ldquo;voicemail&rdquo;, one of those phone tree programs that
people hate so much (&ldquo;press five to hear these options
again&rdquo;).</p><p>Similarly, login is sometimes needed without getty; for
example, when a user logs in over a network, no terminal device is
waiting. Instead, each new connection is handled by a program
called <span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span> that forks and
executes a login process. <span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span>
remains to pass characters between the network and the new
shell.</p><p>As a partial example of how the process works,
<a href="3121l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows an
<span   class="bold"><b>autologin</b></span> replacement for getty.
This replacement is meant for people who are tired of typing their
user ID and password for the bazillionth time. You can boot Linux
and have it drop straight into a couple of shells&mdash;sort of like
DOS, but with virtual consoles.</p><p>To install autologin, copy it to the /sbin (system binaries)
directory and type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x /sbin/autologin
</pre><p>as root. Still as root, edit the /etc/inittab file and change
  the lines that look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/getty 38400 tty1
</pre><p>to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c1:12345:respawn:/sbin/autologin tty1 login -f myid
</pre><p>replacing <b  >myid</b> with your own user ID. Red Hat
installations typically do not have the letter c at the beginning
of the line.
</p><p>Be sure to leave some of the lines containing getty exactly
as they are&mdash;if you do something wrong, you are going to need a way
to log into your system. On my own system, I change
<b  >c1</b> through <b  >c3</b> and run three
initial shells. Once the file is edited, reboot the system and all
should work.</p><p>The first argument to autologin is the name of the terminal.
The rest of the command line is used as the login command that does
the work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x157d580.0x16764d0"></a>A Synopsis of autologin</h2></div></div><p>The first line tells the kernel how to run this program, in
this case by letting the bash shell interpret it. The first exec
line is a Bourne shell trick that lets a shell script change the
source/destination of its standard input, standard output and
standard error. We want to set file descriptors 0, 1 and 2 to refer
to the terminal device as expected by login (and many other
programs) when they run. The <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>
command displays the system's standard logon message. The
<span   class="bold"><b>shift</b></span> command shifts the
positional parameters to the shell script. Argument $1 is deleted,
argument $2 becomes $1, argument $3 becomes $2 and so on. The last
line executes the rest of the command line as a program. In this
case, the <b  >login -f</b> option performs the normal
login procedure, with the <b  >-f</b> option telling
login not to bother with passwords.</p></div></div>
