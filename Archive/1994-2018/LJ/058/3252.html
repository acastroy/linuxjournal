    Mr. Lerner continues to look at the bulletin board system,
    examining the code that works with individual messages.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1acd580.0x1bc5558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, I demonstrated how to build a
small bulletin-board system (BBS) on the Web using Perl and a
relational database. Such a bulletin board is another useful tool
for bringing people together on a web site. This month, I will show
you how to write several different programs, including ones that
create and list the current messages.
</p><p>Before continuing, let's review the two tables that contain
the information in our BBS. I used SQL to define the tables, which
means that while I wrote the database using MySQL, most of these
definitions should work with other relational databases as well.
The code to create these two tables is shown in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="3252l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Table Creation
Code</a></p><p>These two tables will enable a number of tricks to be
performed with threads (i.e., message groups) and messages. Each
message belongs to one thread. Each message (and thread) is
contained in a single database row includes the author's name, her
e-mail address, a subject heading and the text of the
message.</p><p>Pointers to additional information about relational databases
in general or MySQL in particular can be found in &ldquo;Resources&rdquo;,
which also includes information about Perl's vendor-independent
database interface (DBI).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1acd580.0x1bc5818"></a>Creating a Thread with Cookies</h2></div></div><p>Last month I wrote a program, list-threads.pl, to list the
threads (discussion topics) currently defined, and one to create a
new thread, add-thread.pl. However, I didn't provide an HTML form
for use with add-thread.pl, because that form must be produced
within a CGI program. The program that performs this function is
add-thread-form.pl in Listing 2 in the archive file. Listings 2
through 5 are not printed here due to space considerations, but are
available by anonymous download in the file
<a href="../listings/058/3252.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue58/3252.tgz</a>.</p><p>Why use a CGI program rather than a static form? To be
honest, the only reason is to provide a bit of functionality I
particularly like. I order many items on the Web, often returning
to the same vendor multiple times. I dislike having to enter my
name and e-mail address every time I fill out an HTML form on the
Web. I decided to make life a bit easier for people using our
bulletin board system by automatically filling in the &ldquo;name&rdquo; and
&ldquo;email&rdquo; fields with information the user had posted in a previous
transaction.</p><p>If I were to use a templating system such as Embperl or
ePerl, I could use a file that looks closer to standard HTML
without burying the HTML inside of a CGI program. For a variety of
reasons, including the fact that my web-space provider had not made
mod_perl available as of this writing, I decided to use CGI
programs rather than templates.</p><p>Regardless of whether CGI programs or templates are used,
inserting a value from a previous form submission requires keeping
track of state across HTTP transactions. HTTP is a stateless
protocol; that is, each connection occurs without any memory from
previous ones. How, then, can data be retrieved from a previous
form submission?</p><p>The answer is HTTP cookies, a clever hack that has become a
cornerstone of commerce and transaction on the Web. A cookie is a
name,value pair, somewhat like a variable or an entry in a hash
table. The cookie is stored by the user's browser, however, meaning
that it is available across multiple transactions.</p><p>A site can set a cookie as part of an HTTP response, with a
&ldquo;Set-cookie&rdquo; header. Whenever the user visits a site that
previously set a cookie, it includes a &ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; header in its
HTTP request. Thus, the cookie's value can be used to automatically
fill in the &ldquo;value&rdquo; attribute of the &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;email&rdquo;
fields in the HTML form. When the user submits the form to create a
new thread, the program sends headers that set the &ldquo;name&rdquo; and
&ldquo;email&rdquo; cookies on the user's browser. The next time the user
visits the site, those values are sent as part of the HTTP headers
and can be retrieved and used within our program.</p><p>Perl's CGI.pm module allows us to easily work with cookies,
using the &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; method. The following code is put in the
form-creation program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $email = $query-&gt;cookie(-name =&gt; "email") ||
     "";
print "&lt;TR&gt;\n";
print "&lt;TD&gt;Your e-mail address&lt;/TD&gt;\n";
print "&lt;TD&gt;&lt;input type=\"text\"
size=\"50\" ";
print "value=\"$email\"
name=\"email\"&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;\n";
print "&lt;/TR&gt;\n\n";
</pre><p>which assigns <b  >$email</b> the value of the
&ldquo;email&rdquo; cookie or the empty string. The empty string could be
ignored, since Perl automatically assigns the empty string to a
variable the first time its value is retrieved. However, this would
produce a warning message, since the program would be using the
value of an undefined variable. It is safest to assign the empty
string when possible.
</p><p>The value of the text field is set to the current value of
the cookie or the empty string; that is, either the user's e-mail
address or nothing at all. A similar method is used for the user's
name, so that she doesn't have to enter her name multiple
times.</p><p>The form is submitted to add-thread.pl, which we examined
last month. That program uses the elements of the submitted HTML
form to create an SQL query that inserts an appropriate row into
the ATFThreads table. Because we have defined the ID column of
ATFThreads with the AUTO_INCREMENT attribute, we can be sure every
thread will have its own automatically generated ID number that we
can reference in our programs.</p><p>When the form is submitted, our CGI program creates two new
cookies, one named &ldquo;email&rdquo; and another named &ldquo;name&rdquo;. We can
then retrieve the values with CGI.pm's &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; method, as
demonstrated above. Creating the cookies is almost as easy as
retrieving them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $namecookie = $query-&gt;cookie(-name =&gt; "name",
  -value =&gt; $query-&gt;param("name"),
  -expires =&gt; "+1y");
my $emailcookie = $query-&gt;cookie(-name =&gt; "email",
  -value =&gt; $query-&gt;param("email"),
  -expires =&gt; "+1y");
</pre><p>Once we create <b  >$namecookie</b> and
<b  >$emailcookie</b>, we can send them to the user's
browser, thus setting the cookie values, by incorporating them into
the HTTP header:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print $query-&gt;header(-type =&gt; "text/html",
 -cookie =&gt; [$namecookie, $emailcookie]);
</pre><p>Since both cookies are set to expire one year (+1y) after they are
created, the user's browser should continue to send the name and
e-mail address whenever visiting the site in the future.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1acd580.0x1bc5fa8"></a>Working with Messages</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how the underlying database system will
work for threads, we need to begin working with the actual
messages. Because this is a simple system, we'll look only at
posting a new message to a thread and viewing the contents of a
thread.</p><p>In many ways, posting a new message to a thread is similar to
creating a new thread. In both cases, the user's name and e-mail
address are requested. In both cases, the date and time at which
the thread was created is recorded, and the user can enter a title
and a message body.</p><p>The major difference between messages and threads is that
each message must be associated with a thread. This association is
used to create the illusion that the messages are stored
separately, when in fact they are all stored in the same table
(ATFMessages). Users, however, will be able to see only a single
&ldquo;thread-wise slice&rdquo; at a time.</p><p>Just as I used a program to create the thread-adding form, I
will use a CGI program to create the message-posting form, called
post-comment-form.pl (Listing 3 in the archive file). This form
will submit its contents to post-comment.pl (Listing 4 in the
archive file).</p><p>I will ensure that each message is associated with a thread
by putting a selection list inside of the form. Each option in the
selection list will be identified internally with the ID code for
the thread in question and will display the subject line.</p><p>In order for this list to reflect the current status of the
database, a database query is done and the results are displayed in
the form. The query is set by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql =
"SELECT id,subject FROM ATFThreads ORDER BY subject";
</pre><p>and then executed, iterating through each
<b  >id,subject</b> pair. Each pair is inserted into an
<b  >&lt;option&gt;</b> tag, as we can see:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (my @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow)
{
print "&lt;option value=\"$row[0]\" ";
print " selected " if ($thread_id == $row[0]);
print "&gt;$row[1]\n";
}
</pre><p>The standard DBI <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b> method is
used to return the next row from the SELECT query. When no more
rows remain to be retrieved, <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b>
returns false, which ends the <b  >while</b> loop.
</p><p>Also notice how a particular thread's subject can be selected
by comparing its <b  >$thread_id</b> with
<b  >$row[0]</b>. <b  >$thread_id</b> is set to
the value of the query string, which can be loosely defined as
&ldquo;anything following the question mark in a URL&rdquo;. The line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $thread_id = $query-&gt;param("keywords") || 0;
</pre><p>causes CGI.pm to automatically assign the parameter
<b  >keywords</b> to the value of the query string. If
the user invokes the program with
http://www.lerner.co.il/cgi-bin/post-comment-form.pl?5, then
<b  >$thread_id</b> will be assigned the value 5. If the
query string is not assigned, the value is left at 0, in which case
no default thread is selected.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1acd580.0x1bc6840"></a>Posting the Message</h2></div></div><p>When the HTML form is submitted to post-message.pl (Listing 4
in the archive file), the form elements are used to insert a new
row into ATFMessages. As I indicated above, post-message.pl is not
very different from add-thread.pl, except that it stores a thread
ID number along with all the other information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql = "INSERT INTO ATFMessages ";
$sql .= "(thread,date,author,email,subject,text)";
$sql .= "VALUES ";
$sql .= "($thread_id,NOW(),$name,$email,$subject,$text)";
</pre><p>The variable values can be inserted without surrounding them
by quotes, because the standard <b  >$dbh-&gt;quote</b>
method was used. I discovered this method only recently and
continue to be amazed that I was ever able to survive without it.
Simultaneously, the form elements are retrieved and quoted
appropriately in the following lines of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $name = $dbh-&gt;quote($query-&gt;param("name"));
my $email = $dbh-&gt;quote($query-&gt;param("email"));
my $thread_id = $dbh-&gt;quote($query-&gt;param
("thread"));
my $subject = $dbh-&gt;quote($query-&gt;param
("subject"));
my $text = $dbh-&gt;quote($query-&gt;param("text"));
</pre><p>Once this is done, the above SQL query will INSERT a new row. We
tell the user that the new message has been added and produce a
menu bar with a number of options.
</p><p>Believe it or not, these two short programs are all that is
needed to insert a message into the database and thus into our
BBS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1acd580.0x1bc6b58"></a>Viewing a Thread</h2></div></div><p>At this point, the functionality is close to complete. All
that remains to be done is to create view-thread.pl (Listing 5 in
the archive file), which allows us to look at the current contents
of a thread.</p><p>For this program to work, a single argument must be passed in
the query string to identify the thread. To retrieve this value,
use the <b  >keywords</b> HTML form element that CGI.pm
creates:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $thread_id = $query-&gt;param("keywords");
</pre><p>Once <b  >$thread_id</b> is assigned, I can
retrieve the appropriate information from the tables about that
thread. Indeed, two separate queries are done: one from ATFThreads
and a second from ATFMessages. (I could have combined the queries
into a single large SELECT statement, but I chose to keep them
separate.)
</p><p>Early on, I decided to print the date and time of the user's
posting along with the text of the posting. Given the DATETIME data
type, how can we retrieve the date and time in an intelligent way?
MySQL provides a DATE_FORMAT function which takes the value from a
column and writes the contents using a specified format.</p><p>To make life easier, I actually retrieve the same &ldquo;date&rdquo;
column twice, once for the date and again for the time. This allows
literal characters to be inserted between the date and time without
having to worry about possible misinterpretation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$sql = "SELECT id, DATE_FORMAT(date,
   \"%W, %d %b %Y\"), ";
$sql .= "DATE_FORMAT(date, \"%h:%i %p\"), ";
$sql .= "author, email, subject, text FROM ATFMessages ";
$sql .= "WHERE thread = $thread_id ORDER BY date desc";
</pre><p>DATE_FORMAT takes two arguments: the name of the column to
retrieve and a set of codes (in the style of C's
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> statement) indicating the
values to use.
</p><p>Once this query is executed, the code iterates through the
results, printing the messages as they come&mdash;from newest to oldest.
They will come in that order because of the ORDER BY clause in the
SELECT statement. Allowing the database to do our dirty work for us
means we can print all of the messages in a thread with just the
following short loop:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (my @row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow)
{
my ($id, $date, $time, $author, $email, $subject,
   $text) = @row;
print "&lt;a name=\"$id\"&gt;&lt;B&gt;$subject&lt;/B&gt;, ";
print "by &lt;a href=\"mailto:$email\"&gt;$author&lt;/a&gt; ";
print "on $date at $time&lt;/P*gt;\n";
print "&lt;blockquote&gt;$text&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n";
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1acd580.0x1fbf2d0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The basic BBS software is now finished. It can create
threads, add a message to a thread and view the messages within a
thread. If nothing else, this project shows how powerful a set of
database tables can be when paired with some CGI programs.</p><p>Perhaps this system is too basic; it is lacking some
functions that any good bulletin board (or any good web
application) should handle. For instance, it would be nice to
include the ability to search through the posted messages for a
text string or regular expression to find messages relevant to a
particular topic.</p><p>It would also be useful to provide some administrative
functions, unavailable to the public at large, for handling things
at a relatively high level. For example, we might want to reserve
the ability to delete messages that are offensive or unrelated to
the topic. We might even want to give this ability to certain other
users, giving them &ldquo;deputy moderator&rdquo; status.</p><p>Next month, we will see how to provide these functions by
adding just one or two new CGI programs. Meanwhile, you can see
these programs in action at http://www.lerner.co.il/atf/, where the
&ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; BBS is already in use.</p><p><a href="3252s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
