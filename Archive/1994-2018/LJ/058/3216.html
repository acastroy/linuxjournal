    Mr. Dalheimer describes some of the plans
    being made for future versions of KDE.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3216f5.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf3f3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The K Desktop Environment (KDE, see
http://www.kde.org/) has already generated a lot of interest, and
many individual users and institutions alike are using it as their
desktop environment of choice. However, nothing is so good that it
doesn't have room for improvement. Since the beginning, we have
considered stability more important than sticking to announced
dates, so there have been occasional delays when we considered KDE
not stable enough for a release. That said, we hope to release KDE
1.1 after one or two beta versions by the end of 1998. This version
will contain a number of bug fixes, the much sought-after support
for ICQJava, more robustness in the HTML display code and a few new
features such as configurable key bindings for the whole desktop.
Originally, we had planned to release only bug fixes as version
1.0.1. However, the completed new features have been requested many
times and we don't expect to have 2.0 stable for some time, so we
want to include everything that is ready. This way, we can move on
at full steam after 1.1 is released.</p><p><a href="3216f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. KDE
1.1 Desktop</b></span></a></p><p><a href="3216f8.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. KDE
1.0 Desktop</b></span></a></p><p>KDE 2.0, the next &ldquo;official&rdquo; version, will probably be out
in late summer 1999, but this is still uncertain. In the meantime,
we will also release a first alpha version of KOffice (discussed
below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf3f768"></a>Planned Features for KDE 2.0</h2></div></div><p>We plan substantial rewrites and reorganizations of KDE for
version 2.0. This will probably lead to snapshots that are unstable
or don't compile, but as always, KDE follows the open-source model
closely and makes daily snapshots available via the FTP site and
the CVSup server. (CVSup is a software package for distributing and
updating source trees from a master repository on a remote server
host.)</p><p>Some of the new code that will go into KDE 2.0 belongs to the
area file manager/web browser/networking code. Most of the new code
is already written and just waiting to be committed to the CVS
after the release of KDE 1.1. Changes include a complete rewrite of
the file manager and the networking code which provides a great
improvement over the current version, the ability to browse
compressed archives and a complete overhaul of the user interface
of the file manager. Related to this is the HTML widget currently
in the process of being reorganized to make it more adaptable to
new HTML standards and to provide better support for JavaScript and
a free Java virtual machine.
(<span   class="bold"><b>kaffe</b></span>, http://www.kaffe.org/, is
a candidate if it supports standard AWT, Abstract Window Toolkit,
programs by then.) Most of this is not just vaporware or simply
plans for the future, but existing code, part of which is also
available via the CVSup server with anonymous access.</p><p>Another program to be completely rewritten is the mail
program KMail. The new version, dubbed KMail 2, will be more robust
and flexible with respect to various attachments and feature IMAP
support.</p><p>Of course, there is not only revolution such as complete
rewrites, but also evolution as seen in the continuous development
of existing features. More and more configuration modules are being
added to the control center and we plan to provide more modules
geared specifically toward system administrators. We hope to be
able to support both LinuxConf and COAS (Caldera Open
Administration System), but are definitely in need of more skilled
developers to help in this area.</p><p>Another area of improvement is the drag-and-drop protocol
where we will switch from our &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; protocol to the XDND
protocol, since it will likely become the future drag-and-drop
standard on (at least free) UNIX systems and is currently supported
by programs written with the JX toolkit. The GNOME developers have
indicated that they will also support this protocol, possibly
leading to a first point of interoperability between the KDE and
GNOME programs.</p><p>We will also make use of some new features provided by
version 2.0 of Qt, the toolkit used with KDE. Among these are
themes and Unicode support. Themes are something I personally
consider less important for a desktop aimed at improving
productivity, but I know a lot of users want it and we aim to
please. Note that some theme ability is currently in KDE (see e.g.,
http://kde.themes.org/), but the new code will extend this to
single widgets within the application windows.</p><p>Plans have been made to tear the window manager engine out of
the window manager KWM and put it into the library, so that there
can be different window managers to implement a different
look-and-feel and still provide the window manager functionality
needed by a full-featured KDE desktop.</p><p>Unicode (see http://www.unicode.org/) is very important to
gain acceptance in the Far East and other areas of the world with
scripts containing more than 256 characters. Two Chinese
localizations of KDE already exist, but these require a patched X
server that combines two character codes transmitted for display
into one. With Unicode support, such tricks will not be necessary,
as the KDE message files can then contain 16-bit characters
directly.</p><p>The usability of Unicode support is based heavily on
availability of decent fonts for the script in question, something
UNIX systems have traditionally been lacking. I have been looking
at integrating the free True Type engine Freetype into KDE, but
this is still in the beginning stages. (Contributions are welcome.)
Another option is using a font server that supports True Type
fonts.</p><p>Another area where work is being done is making KDE
accessible for handicapped users. It is already possible to use
very large fonts with KDE programs and especially to set such a
large font once and for all for all KDE applications, so that
people with slight vision impairment can use KDE programs, but this
is not enough. We have had some success with voice-type software,
i.e., software that allows users to navigate and operate the
desktop and applications by speaking commands into a microphone. We
are working with universities on leveraging their research results
and making usable programs out of them. Another feature that falls
into this category but has not been addressed yet is screen
readers, i.e., software that reads out whatever is visible on your
screen via your sound card and the speakers. While the necessary
text-to-speech synthesis is a non-trivial problem (even though
programs such as <span   class="bold"><b>emacspeak</b></span> show
that it can be done in free software), screen readers become even
more difficult to write when graphical user interfaces are
involved, because a single text flow is no longer available as on
terminal screens.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3216f6.jpg"></div>
</p><p>The topic most interesting to readers is the development of
KOffice. KOffice (see http://koffice.kde.org/) is intended to be a
complete office productivity suite like Microsoft Office or Lotus
SmartSuite. It is CORBA-based (using the high-quality, freely
available ORB Mico that makes good use of today's compiler
technology) and uses the Open Parts as its object model. Open Parts
is the master's thesis topic of one of our developers and provides
a rich object model on top of the rather bare-bones CORBA standard,
including addition of event services and event filtering to CORBA.
Open Parts can even be used with non-KDE applications.</p><p>Not only the large KOffice applications will use CORBA, but
this technology will also be used in other areas, including the
panel which would then be better able to swallow other programs. On
the other hand, adding CORBA compliance to a relatively small
program like the panel means bloating it, and we still have to
investigate whether this is truly worth it.</p><p><a href="3216f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
KPresenter</b></span></a></p><p><a href="3216f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
KSpread</b></span></a></p><p>Currently, KOffice consists of the following applications
which, as I write, have different levels of usefulness. First,
there is KPresenter (see Figure 3), a presentation program in the
spirit of MS PowerPoint that has already been used for &ldquo;real
work&rdquo; (like my KDE presentation at the last International Linux
Congress in Cologne) and features a large number of blending
effects. Then, there is KSpread (see Figure 4), a spreadsheet that
already contains about 20% of the functionality of MS Excel and is
easily extensible via scripts written in Python.</p><p>A recent addition to KOffice is KWord, a word processor aimed
at smaller size documents like personal letters, as well as
complete books. Besides normal word processing features, it also
has some features known from DTP programs, such as Adobe
FrameMaker. For large documents or those containing many formulas,
it might be better still to use KLyX, a WYSIAWYG
(what-you-see-is-almost-what-you-get) document processor that uses
LaTeX as its formatting engine and is based on its older brother,
LyX. KLyX is not yet as fully integrated into the KOffice concept
as the other applications, but hopefully it will be in the near
future.</p><p><a href="3216f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
KIllustrator</b></span></a></p><p><a href="3216f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6.
KFormula and KImage</b></span></a></p><p>The KOffice application that is probably most advanced at the
moment is KIllustrator (see Figure 5), a vector-based drawing
package. It features a lot of drawing tools and is very usable. Two
other applications of KOffice are KFormula (see Figure 6), a
mathematical formula typesetter; and KImage, a smaller
image-manipulation program. Finally, there is KChart, a component
for drawing business graphs such as bar charts and pie charts; and
KOrganizer, an organizer program in the spirit of Lotus Organizer
that is quite usable and sports many features and different
views.</p><p>Since all KOffice programs are based on the Open Parts
framework, they can all be embedded into each other. You can nicely
embed a spreadsheet document into your word processor document and
beef the whole thing up with a vector drawing done with
KIllustrator. This embedding also features in-place activation with
dynamic menu bars, and unlike other embedding technologies on some
platforms we like to hate, it is quite stable.</p><p>We are very aware that for Linux to become a viable
alternative to Windows or the Macintosh, it must feature a
consistent easy-to-use desktop and also have an office productivity
suite that need not (or should not) be as bloated as Microsoft
Office, but definitely needs the features used on a daily basis and
must be able to read common document formats. Unfortunately,
Microsoft Office formats are not well-documented. Still, with the
help of the work done in LAOLA (library for Microsoft structured
storage files), we hope to be able to support at least some of
them. Even though I think this is a boring task (if somebody thinks
I am wrong here, you are welcome to help with this project), we
will also write an RTF reader and writer, and I have already
successfully imported some FrameMaker documents via my homegrown
filter into KWord. Whether other formats (such as WordPerfect,
StarOffice or the Lotus SmartSuite) will be supported depends on
two things: whether the respective manufacturers will make their
format documentation available and whether someone volunteers to do
the work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe47580.0xf40420"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, many things are happening in the KDE world
and development is occurring faster than ever. As with all free
software projects, we can be only as good as the people who support
us, so if you are interested in GUI hacking, writing file-format
filters or any of the other topics I have mentioned (or something
completely different that fits into the overall KDE concept), don't
hesitate to contact us (see http://www.kde.org/ for contact
information). This is truly an exciting project to be in.</p></div></div>
