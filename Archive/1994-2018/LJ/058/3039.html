    Mr. Poag describes the InSight project&mdash;designing a
    desktop which uses color to inform the user of what is happening
    with his applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x1d724a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>For the seven-month period spanning July
1997 to late January 1998, I was involved in an OS development
project called InSight. Part of my role within the InSight
development group was to study interface designs in an attempt to
further understand which aspects would still be viable and useful
for users for the next five to seven years. In addition to the
interface, I had the opportunity to collaborate on the design of
the underlying OS, since much of what we were doing on the visible
aspects of the system was tied very heavily to the underlying
workings of the OS. Bringing together the design of the desktop and
the underlying mechanics of the OS, we hit on what we believed to
be a good idea&mdash;the concept of color-reactive destop elements.

1</b></span></a></p><p>A lamp is a window element in which the color is tied
directly to the operational status of the application using that
window. Simply put, it is like a status LED for that particular
application. As you use the program, its lamp changes color
depending upon what is happening and what you'd like it to
reflect&mdash;CPU usage, program status, etc.</p><p>Let's assume you have an e-mail checker which checks your
mailbox every two minutes for new mail. Most of the time the lamp
in the window remains blue, meaning it is just sitting around
waiting for something to do. Every two minutes it turns yellow to
indicate it is busy checking your mailbox for new mail. If no mail
is found, it goes back to blue. If new mail <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
found, it turns yellow or begins flashing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x1d728c8"></a>Beacons</h2></div></div><p><a href="3039f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
2</b></span></a></p><p>Beacons are like miniature lamps, meant to be used only when
applications are in an <span   class="emphasis"><em>iconified</em></span> state. If you
have a window open on your desktop, it has a lamp in one corner of
the window. Now, when you click the iconify button, the entire
application is collapsed into an icon on your desktop. If you still
want to monitor that application, collapse it to a beacon instead
of an icon. In that way, you will be able to see what is going on
with the application without having to constantly open and close
it.</p><p>For example, suppose you are downloading five different RPMs
via FTP. You can collapse each one down to a beacon with a color
that reflects whether or not the download is proceeding without
problems. At this point, you have five little beacon icons at the
bottom of your screen and you can monitor their progress by
checking if they are all still glowing a nice shade of green. You
could even set it up so that the color was a function of transfer
speed. Bright green could indicate a fast transfer; red could
indicate a slow or dead transfer.</p><p>In order to fully understand how lamps and beacons behave,
keep in mind the fact that the color of the lamp (or of the beacon)
can be tied to a variety of &ldquo;behavior sets&rdquo; such as CPU usage,
process status, or specific events which may occur within specific
applications. A &ldquo;behavior set&rdquo; dictates what actions will produce
what colors. Here are a few practical examples.</p><p><a href="3039f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
3</b></span></a></p><p>Suppose one of the above-mentioned FTP transfers begins to
stall. One of the beacons begins to glow red and stays red for
several minutes. Simply pop the window back open, kill or restart
the transfer. The instant you kill that process, the other four
beacons begin to glow more brightly, since you have just improved
the speed of the other four by freeing up some bandwidth.</p><p>Beacons make the task of babysitting multiple applications a
breeze. An entire 3-D rendering package could be collapsed down to
a single beacon&mdash;one that will turn green when the rendering of a
scene was complete, for example. There is no longer any need to
continually pop the application back open to see what is going
on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x1d72d98"></a>Methodology</h2></div></div><p><a href="3039f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
4</b></span></a></p><p>Since the behavior of color-reactive elements should be
consistent throughout the desktop, a centralized point of control
is needed (in the form of a control panel, for example) to allow
the user top-level control. From there, it would also be wise to
allow the applications, if permitted by the user, to dictate their
own behavior sets. Ultimately, the user must have total and
complete freedom to dictate the appearance and behavior of
color-reactive elements on his or her desktop.</p><p>There are two ways to go about changing the appearance of a
lamp or beacon on the desktop. With InSight, the plan was simply to
change the icon on the fly by loading the appropriately-colored
icon in its place. The second way, which takes considerably more
CPU time to accomplish, involves hue-shifting the image data within
the icon +/- 180 degrees to achieve the desired color.</p><p>The first method requires a small cache of colored icons to
be present and ready to be loaded. About eight different colored
lamp icons (and eight beacon icons) are usually enough to handle
most situations. On the FTP site
<a href="../listings/058/3039.zip" target="_self">(ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue58/)</a>
is a file called 3039.zip, containing a small archive of example
lamps and beacons in different colors for you to look at and
experiment with. The eight colors are clear, blue, aqua, green,
yellow, amber, red and purple. That's right&mdash;the raw image data has
already been provided for you. These icons are, in all respects,
ready-to-use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x1d730b0"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p><a href="3039f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure
5</b></span></a></p><p>Here's how to go about constructing a control panel to handle
behavior sets for color-reactive desktop elements.</p><p>The user should be presented with a list of potential
&ldquo;states&rdquo; (like Busy, Idle, Sleeping, Error, etc.) and then be
given the ability to map the color of their choice to each
state.</p><p>The Color Transition Table allows the user to specify the
physical behavior of the Lamp or Beacon. A whole row of &ldquo;C&rdquo; means
simply &ldquo;for this behavior, the color always remains clear&rdquo;. A
repeating sequence of <b  >BRBRBRBRBRBR</b> would make
the lamp flash rapidly between blue and red, over and over again.
To slow down the rate of blinking, use a sequence like
<b  >BBBBRRRRBBBBRRRR</b>.</p><p>The Color Transition Table also allows the user to specify
the sequence of colors it will show to indicate each specific
state. If you wanted to get the user's attention, you would
probably want to make the lamp or beacon flash rapidly. This can be
done by alternating the sequence of colors, like drum beats in a
song. To use an analogy, the lights on a police car can be thought
of as color-reactive elements. When the police car is in a state
called &ldquo;pursuit&rdquo;, its behavior is red, blue, red, blue, red,
blue.</p><p>To make a lamp or a beacon flash like it is on fire, a
sequence like ROYOROYOR will make it strobe from red to orange to
yellow to orange, repeatedly.</p><p>The Color Transition Table allows for a tremendous amount of
flexibility when dictating the precise behavior of color-reactive
desktop elements. By simply changing the entries in the table, you
can do everything from solid colors to wild rainbow effects just by
playing with the order of colors for each state.</p><p><a href="3039l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>An example behavior set is shown in Listing 1. This is what
the behavior set would look like if you wanted:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Clear color for idle</p></li><li><p>Blue for sleeping</p></li><li><p>Violet for low CPU usage</p></li><li><p>Red for moderate CPU usage</p></li><li><p>Orange for heavy CPU usage</p></li><li><p>Yellow for severe CPU usage</p></li><li><p>Slow blinking green/clear for attention</p></li><li><p>Fast blinking red/clear for error</p></li><li><p>Normal blinking aqua/clear for busy</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x1d73cb8"></a>Other Examples</h2></div></div><p>Using color as a function of CPU usage, a behavior set might
look like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Dead: clear</p></li><li><p>Light: purple</p></li><li><p>Moderate: blue</p></li><li><p>Heavy: green</p></li><li><p>Severe: yellow</p></li><li><p>Extremely CPU-intensive: red</p></li></ul></div><p>As a function of process state, it might be defined this way:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Zombie: clear</p></li><li><p>Sleeping: purple</p></li><li><p>Idle: blue</p></li><li><p>Running: green</p></li><li><p>Waiting: yellow</p></li><li><p>Segfault/dead stop: red</p></li></ul></div>

As a user cue, perhaps in a 3-D rendering package:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Waiting for user input: blue</p></li><li><p>Busy: yellow</p></li><li><p>Rendering: green</p></li><li><p>Error: red</p></li><li><p>Finished: clear</p></li></ul></div>

As you can see, instead of using simple solid colors, lamps and
beacons can be made to flash colors, such as flashing red to
indicate a catastrophic failure, alert or even an incoming message.

beacon that would turn green whenever you had a new message
waiting. A packet sniffer could be made to flash red whenever
suspect ICMP packets are received. An FTP client could use its lamp
to indicate the various stages of connection to a host or the
progress of a file transfer.</p><p><a href="3039s2.html" target="_self">Questions and Answers</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x216cfe0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I propose that the GNOME desktop should not only feature this

It is a simple concept to understand, simple to implement, and its

Burns has developed a color-reactive Lamp/Beacon widget to the
GNOME UI library which is currently part of the GNOME CVS tree.
GNOME application coders now have the ability to incorporate CR
into their applications at their discretion.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
