    Janet Smith is the Director of the Linux Business Unit for
    Informix Software,
    Inc.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3153f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2c580.0x1c24348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Janet Smith is the Director of the Linux
Business Unit for Informix Software, Inc. Her responsibilities
include implementing marketing strategies as well as providing
solutions to product and strategic issues concerning Linux. At
Informix, prior to being promoted to the Linux Business Unit, Janet
held the positions of Program Manager and Senior Development
Manager in Product Development. She was the Engineering Manager
responsible for the first enterprise-ready database to be ported to
Linux.</p><p>After graduating with a BS degree in Accounting from the
University of Florida, Smith began her career with Arthur Andersen
&amp; Co. She joined Tandem Computers in 1989 and held postions in
Product Management and Technical Support until 1994, when she
joined Informix. Janet lives in the Bay Area with her husband,
Clark, and their little boss: daughter, Veronica.</p><p>I talked to Janet by e-mail in November 1998 to discuss Linux
and Informix.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What event first
brought Linux to your attention?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: It was a response
from our users, rather than an event, that brought Linux to our
attention. Our users, organized as the Informix International User
Group, make up an incredible collection of technical and business
experts. They know the capabilities of Informix products better
than anyone in the world, and we listen to their suggestions and
respond to their requests.</p><p>Our users demanded the marriage of the efficient,
feature-rich, &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; Linux operating system and the
scalability, performance and extensibility of Informix database
options. We delivered our first Linux products, INFORMIX-SE and
INFORMIX-ESQL/C, in July at the Informix Worldwide User Conference.
The response has been overwhelming.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What sort of
evaluation procedures did you use to decide to support
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: User demand drove our
investment in Linux. We spoke with a number of Linux users and a
number of Informix users who were considering the Linux OS. We came
away with a strong understanding of three things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Linux market is growing very rapidly.</p></li><li><p>The Linux market needs a robust, high-performance,
feature-rich database.</p></li><li><p>Informix has unique advantages that make it a
perfect choice for the Linux community.</p></li></ul></div><p>We saw a tremendous opportunity and we moved quickly to
provide the first commercial database on Linux with our SE
offering.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What advantages do
you see in having products that support Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: First, it is
important to understand that one of Informix's core business
strategies is developing strong partnerships. We have long-standing
relationships with our world-class VARs, ISVs, distributors,
hardware partners and customers. Businesses rely on applications
built on technology from Informix.</p><p>Linux allows our partners to move into new markets and
provides a significantly lower invoice cost for delivering
solutions to customers. In addition to being a &ldquo;no-cost&rdquo;
operating system, it also provides for the excellent reuse of
hardware. This opens up opportunities and allows our partners to
move their solutions into new industries and markets&mdash;markets that
Microsoft simply doesn't address.</p><p>The growth of the Linux OS appears to cut across nearly every
vertical market, and it is gaining acceptance through every layer
of the IT infrastructure. Whether you are developing or deploying,
the customer or the vendor, the VAR or the hardware vendor,
everybody wins. Linux is revolutionizing our industry.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What are the
disadvantages?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: Linux has tremendous
momentum right now, and the challenge is to be able to quickly
respond to changes within the Linux community. There is still some
standardization necessary to create a truly ubiquitous operating
environment. As the first commercial vendor to deliver product on
Linux, we had to work through some of those issues. Informix
supports the efforts of the Linux Standards Board (LSB) and we know
the Linux community is completely committed to meeting their
current standards of excellence today and in the future.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you find
most attractive about Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: The total cost of
ownership is clearly one of the drivers within this market. Linux
allows a much larger range of applications to be built at a much
lower cost than previously imagined. Users and developers are
looking for an alternative to Windows NT.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How do you compare
Linux with other operating systems?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: The acceptance of
Linux is so rapid and the passion of the community so high that the
same enterprise-wide tests available on other operating systems
will soon benefit Linux. In general, we have found Linux to be as
reliable as other UNIX platforms.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What other
platforms do you support?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: Informix products are
available on UNIX, NT and Linux. Informix supports all major UNIX
platforms including Sun, HP, SGI, Sequent, IBM, Compaq/DEC,
Compaq/Tandem, SNI, UNIXware, Data General, Intel Solaris, NEC,
Fujitsu, NCR and Hitachi.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Do you plan to
support Linux with all your products? If not, why not?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: It is clear the Linux
market needs Informix solutions, and we are committed to the Linux
platform. We plan on supporting Linux by providing the Informix
technology that addresses the needs of the market. Our web site, as
well as our Informix Developer Network, describes solutions that
benefit the Linux community. We will continue to make specific
announcements regarding our plans for delivering additional
products on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us about the
products you have ported to Linux and why you chose to port them to
Linux first.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: INFORMIX-SE and
INFORMIX-ESQL/C are our first entrants into Linux, because both are
well-known and widely supported by our VARs and ISVs. INFORMIX-SE
is an enterprise database that is extremely fast, has a small
footprint, is easily embedded and requires virtually no
configuration or management.</p><p>Linux developers are able to embed INFORMIX-SE as part of
their applications without requiring their customers to hire a DBA
to maintain and support the deployed application. It enables
current INFORMIX-SE developers to deploy their applications on
Linux and take advantage of Linux and the Apache Web Server.
INFORMIX-SE is a fabulous fit of a high-performance database with a
low-cost, low-maintenance web server.</p><p>INFORMIX-ESQL/C on Linux is for C developers building
applications to access an Informix database on any platform,
including Linux. INFORMIX-ESQL/C on Linux also enables developers
with existing applications to easily port them to Linux. It
provides the convenience of entering SQL statements directly into
the C language source code. Developers can use SQL to issue
commands to the Informix server and to manage the result sets of
data from queries. INFORMIX-ESQL/C provides low-level control over
the application for session management and error handling and gives
the developer direct access to all database functions.
INFORMIX-ESQL/C requires significantly less coding and is easier,
faster, more productive and less error-prone than low-level direct
calls to libraries.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Have you
considered making any of your products Open Source?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: Informix is committed
to increasing developer participation in our products and allowing
developers to add value. So, we are looking at Open Source and
trying to understand which products might be appropriate within
that model. It is important to remember that Informix is already
the most open database available. Though not truly open source, our
APIs give developers powerful ways to extend the functionality of
the database. We think that meets the needs of the market
today.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you think
needs to be added to Linux to make it more attractive to business
users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: The availability of
applications is what will drive Linux in the business community. We
are committed to working with our partners, VARs and ISVs to make
their applications available on Linux quickly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Linux seems to be
climbing rapidly in popularity with all the PR it has gotten
recently. How long do you expect that to last?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: The growth rates
posted are quite impressive, and prove Linux is not a fad. The
recent PR will only fuel the fire. We think Linux is here to
stay.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What do you see in
the future for your company and Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Janet</b></span>: The future for
Informix and Linux is not only prosperous, but also fun. We've just
entered the Database Software Olympics and the Linux community
bestows the medals. Technology is the Informix playing field, the
games have begun, and we are going for gold.</p></div></div>
