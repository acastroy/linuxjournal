purchasing it was so that I could interoperate with co-workers who
run MS Office. Applixware has the best MS Office import filters I
have seen, but they are not quite perfect. I found that while text
and tables seem to import well, figures are another story. So far,
I have only tried importing a few MS Word 7.0 documents, but in
general, the figures fail to convert. I recognize the complexity of
the conversion task, and I applaud Applix for doing as well as it
does. I hope the filters continue to mature, so that I can finally
dump Windows 95 off my machine and use Linux exclusively.</p><p>&mdash;Steve Falco sfalco@worldnet.att.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x2319240"></a>Erratum in <i  >LJ</i> February

me greatly in learning about Linux.</p><p>Thank you very much for reporting on Dr. Meyer, Eiffel and

Process</h2></div></div><p>Last week I decided to totally change over to Linux after
reading the latest horror story about Windows. Apparently, people
connected to the Internet on W-95-98 can be snooped on simply by
typing their IP number and a few backslashes. Suddenly, their whole
system appears in the other person's MS Explorer window.</p><p>So here I am, scurrying to get a faster motherboard and a
bigger hard drive. I am all enthusiastic about the new KDE and
GNOME projects, yet when I read the installation manuals&mdash;S.u.S.E.
or Red Hat&mdash;I am horrified by how much totally
new and alien system configuration
is needed for a new Linux user. The problem is exemplified by the
marvelous advertising flyer sent out by S.u.S.E. for its 5.2
release. It seduces the user with a DOS-Windows box packed with a
lifetime accumulation of precious utilities. It implies that UNIX
clones for these treasures (and more) effortlessly await on the new
Linux user's desktop. The actual case is that this happens only
after endless installations and configurations.</p><p>The open-source concept has been much in the news lately, yet
it seems that these installation processes are the one place where
the open-source environment is not used to evolve solutions to
these problems. Rather, it is the special province of the private
bundling companies. Regardless of whether they put their products
in the public domain, they are not developed in the open. People
seem to believe that the greed of these companies will produce the
fastest results, but I have not seen any miracles yet. Perhaps
there are installation projects underway in the open-source
community. If so, nothing could be more critical to the advancement
of Linux.</p><p>We often hear people crowing in <i  >LJ</i> that
some huge corporation or the defense department is now more
efficient because of Linux. I am much more impressed by ease of use
by the ordinary person. If <i  >LJ</i> were to make
open-source installation projects a continuing focus of articles,
it could do an incredible service to the evolution and spread of
Linux.</p><p>&mdash;David Briars dbriars@sover.net</p><p>Easier installation seems to be what everyone is asking for
these days. Red Hat is working on it with LinuxConf, and Caldera
with COAS (see article in this issue) &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x2319e48"></a>Happy Hacking Keyboard Price</h2></div></div><p>The correct price for the Happy Hacking Keyboard at the time
of the article was $159, not $189. Today I cut the price again from
$159 to $139 as a standard price. Please let your readers
know.</p><p>&mdash;Ted Abe, PFU America, Inc. tetsu@pfuca.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x2319fa8"></a>BTS Correction</h2></div></div><p>In the November 1998 &ldquo;Best of Technical Support&rdquo;, weird
things have been happening to Eric Benoit's system.
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> misbehaves, as do
<span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>. Scott Maxwell thinks it may
be terminal options, but the answer lies with /dev/tty. My bet is
that somehow, something has changed the permissions on it and it is
no longer readable. Just type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod u+rw /dev/tty
</pre><p>and all will be well. You should probably make sure it is
writable while you are at it.
</p><p>I guess most programs that decide to access /dev/tty to talk
to a real user never consider the possibility that they do not have
permission to do so.</p><p>In general, processes inherit an open file handle to /dev/tty
from their parent as stdin, stdout and stderr. The process that
opens them in the first place is
<span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span> which is running as root, so
it has no problems. Either that or the top-level program opens a
particular real or virtual terminal using a device name which will
have the permission bits set differently.</p><p>&mdash;Adrian Pronk apronk@sangacorp.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x231a3c8"></a><i  >Linux Journal</i> and Red

Error Messages&rdquo;: another reason for the failure to mount the root
partition during boot is that the root file system was compiled as
a module when the kernel was built, rather than compiled into the
kernel itself. When the root file system is first mounted during
the boot process, no modules are loaded, and modules cannot be
loaded until the root file system is mounted. If the file system
driver is a module, then the kernel cannot mount it&mdash;so it
panics.</p><p>&mdash;Rob Singleton single@nortelnetworks.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x231a8f0"></a>Real Life Business Story</h2></div></div><p>As a system integration tool, Linux has allowed us to prepare
custom network file servers which can do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide complete web-server services
(Apache).</p></li><li><p>Provide Internet connectivity for many users on the
local LAN (IP-Masquerade).</p></li><li><p>Provide file and printer services for Windows/DOS
users (Samba).</p></li><li><p>Provide file and printer services for Netware users
(MARS_NWE, NCPFS).</p></li><li><p>Provide complete internal/external e-mail services
(Sendmail).</p></li><li><p>Provide inexpensive terminals in both graphical and
text-based platforms with the X Window System which can be
connected in a variety of ways (Ethernet, serial, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Provide complete point-to-point protocol (PPP)
implementation for routing and other remote-oriented
operations.</p></li><li><p>Provide a fully scalable system that can grow with
the company.</p></li></ul></div><p>All of the above have been thoroughly tested and implemented.
We could not be happier with the performance and continued
development of this OS.

Bandel's article &ldquo;CIDR: A Prescription for Shortness of Address
Space&rdquo;. On page 26, under the CIDR heading, second paragraph, it
states:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For a Class C address, this default subnet is 24
bytes long, so putting all ones in the first 24 bytes and zeroes in
the rest, we have 255.255.255.0.</p></blockquote></div><p>I think this should instead read 24 bits, rather than bytes,
since each octet is composed of 8 bits, which gives 4 total bytes.
Just wanted to bring this to your attention. Great article!

that little lapse of attention on my part. Guess I need to re-read

times.  &mdash;dbandel@ix.netcom.com</p></div></div>
