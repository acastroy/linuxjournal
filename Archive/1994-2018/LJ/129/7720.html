When a user reports a bug you can't duplicate, let your application
help you find the problem. Add logging now and be a debugging master
after the software gets deployed.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Bug tracking is often one of the most difficult processes in software
development. Users may have situations different from developers, and
bugs that are a big problem for users may not even be visible on
developers' machines. Sometimes bugs can come and go, or networked
programs may encounter bugs only when talking to specific servers or
clients. In this article, I discuss techniques software
developers can employ to help track down bugs more easily.
</p><p>
First, I discuss two ways to make it easier to receive
and manage bugs, and then I show how to make
your programs generate more useful debugging output.
Then, I talk about tracking down troublesome
bugs. Finally, I cover some practices that can
help prevent bugs in the first place. Many of the
techniques described in this article are employed in
OfflineIMAP (see &ldquo;Fast Convenient Mail for Travel:
OfflineIMAP&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, March 2004).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197d558"></a>
Tracking Bugs</h2></div></div><p>
Before examining how to make better bug reports possible, a
critical first step is making sure you can deal with the bug reports
you receive. For some small projects, simply publishing an e-mail
address is sufficient.
However, most projects need something more. Developers often get busy
and forget about things. Bugs may be complicated to solve, requiring
input from several people, or there simply may be a lot of bug reports.
</p><p>
A bug-tracking system (BTS) is a great way to help ensure that bugs are not
forgotten. Most BTS implementations provide a way to track
correspondence, handle attached files and delegate responsibility to
particular people. Some also support categorization based on things
such as severity, user environment and specific components.
</p><p>
If your project is hosted at a project hosting site such as SourceForge or Savannah,
you already have a BTS available for your use. You should use it and
encourage your users to submit bugs through that interface rather than
to a mailing list.
</p><p>
If you need more flexibility, you can find BTS programs for Linux.
Some of the most popular free software BTS programs are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Bugzilla, the BTS used by the Mozilla Project, is
a flexible system primarily used through its Web
interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Request Tracker can be used as both a
bug-tracking system and a support-tracking system. It features
both Web and e-mail interfaces, though some administrative
functions can occur only through the Web interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Jitterbug is the BTS used by the Samba
Project. It is similar in concept to Bugzilla but is more
lightweight.
</p></li><li><p>
Debbugs is the BTS used by the Debian
Project. Debbugs has a Web interface, though it is read-only; all
manipulations occur by e-mail. Debbugs is best suited for
large projects with clearly identifiable components and
responsibility for those components.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I personally prefer Request Tracker, because it seems to have a nice
blend of features for a BTS. Your own requirements may
differ.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197dad8"></a>
Make It Easy to Submit Bugs</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes I find a nasty bug in a program and want to report it.
But to do so, I have to fill out a detailed questionnaire and perhaps
divulge information I'd rather not.
It should be easy for people to submit bugs and
the information needed to
track them down. If you take submissions on the Web, make the process
simple. Don't require too much information, and accept submissions
even if people don't know some information. Don't expect users to
know anything about the different components of the project or which
developers are responsible for a given problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197dbe0"></a>
Logging</h2></div></div><p>
When tracking down problems, you often want to know what state the
program is in. Other times, you may want to know what actions were
carried out prior to triggering the bug. Because users of programs
don't necessarily have expertise with your code and a debugger,
logging often is called for.
Logging simply means writing out a record of the actions carried
out. Simple programs might merely print out information,
but usually you'll want something a little more capable.
</p><p>
Non-interactive programs, such as network servers, do not have a screen
on which to display information. These programs often maintain a
log file or use the syslog facility built in to Linux and UNIX
systems.
</p><p>
Interactive programs may display information on-screen or also
may generate a file. Having a log file available can make bug reporting
easier, because the user simply can attach it to a bug report.
</p><p>
Sometimes, you might need quite a bit of data to figure out what's
going on with a specific problem. However, all this data may be
overkill for a normal session&mdash;it could flow right off a user's
screen or fill up a hard disk. Therefore, many programs have a notion
of a log level. The user can set, at runtime, how much information
should be logged. Some programs even may have log categories, where
users can configure which types of information are logged.
OfflineIMAP uses this approach. For troublesome problems, users
can turn on a communications log, which logs all data sent to or
received from the IMAP server.
</p><p>
Python 2.3 introduced a useful module called logging. The logging
module provides a uniform interface to several different ways of
logging messages. Its supported logging methods include writing
messages to files, network services, syslog, e-mailing messages and
several others. The following is a simple example that illustrates use of the
logging module:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python
import logging, sys

# Create the logger object
l = logging.getLogger('testlog')

# Create a handler and assign it to the object
handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr)
l.addHandler(handler)

# Levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.
# Set the default level here. Any log messages
# beneath that level are dropped.
l.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Try it out.

l.debug("Debug message -- system initialized.")
l.info("Here's some info.  I've just debugged.")
l.warning("I don't have many messages left.")
l.error("Only one more message to go.")
l.critical("Nothing else to do!")
</pre>
</p><p>
This program begins by initializing the logger. It uses the
StreamHandler to write logged text to standard error. It also sets
the log level to INFO. Then it logs five messages. When you run this
program, you see only the last four. The debug message was
filtered out by setting the level to INFO. Many programs have a
configuration or command-line option to set the level at runtime.
You can use different logging methods simply by adding a different
handler to your Logger object. The Python documentation has a
reference for all the available handlers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197def8"></a>
Check Input</h2></div></div><p>
Make sure the input you are receiving is valid. For instance, if
you are expecting something on the command line, check to make sure
you have the appropriate number of arguments before trying to use them
(or trap the resulting exception). This gives users a better
error message. Here's a sample Python program that demonstrates this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

try:
    print "You supplied: %s" % sys.argv[1]
except IndexError:
    print "You forgot an argument."
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197e058"></a>
Handle Exceptions</h2></div></div><p>
Several programming languages, such as Java, Python and OCaml,
include support for exceptions. With exceptions, you can catch errors
at the place you choose, rather than having to check and handle errors
with each call that may produce a problem.
Sometimes, it might be correct to let exceptions go unhandled, but usually
that is not the case. Exceptions should be caught and handled. Although
it may be appropriate to terminate the program if you can't open the
file a user asks for, it is still better to do so with an error
message giving the filename and problem rather than let the user
receive an ugly exception message.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197e160"></a>
Capture Exceptions</h2></div></div><p>
For exceptions that really are fatal to your program, you still may
want to capture them. This would allow you, for instance, to log them
to a file or display the exception in a pop-up box in the GUI
application. This makes it easier for users to send the
stack trace back to you. You also can use a generic exception catcher
to perform other activities, perhaps output contents of various
buffers to help you figure out what was going on at the time.
</p><p>
The following is an example that logs any exceptions along with some
information about the program currently running. It then
re-raises the exception and exits:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python
import logging, sys, StringIO, traceback, os

l = logging.getLogger('testlog')

handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr)
l.addHandler(handler)
formatter = logging.Formatter("LOG: %(message)s")
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

l.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def logexception():
    sbuf = StringIO.StringIO()
    traceback.print_exc(file = sbuf)
    excval = sbuf.getvalue()
    l.critical(" *** Exception Detected ***")
    l.critical("Current PID: %d" % os.getpid())
    l.critical("Program name: %s" % sys.argv[0])
    l.critical("Command line: %s" % \
               str(sys.argv[1:]))
    for line in excval.split("\n"):
        l.critical(line)

def main():
    print "Hello, I'm running."
    raise RuntimeError("Oops! I've had a problem!")

try:
    main()
except:
    logexception()
    raise
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run this program, you should see something like this on your
screen:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello, I'm running.
LOG:  *** Exception Detected ***
LOG: Current PID: 28441
LOG: Program name: /tmp/logerror.py
LOG: Command line: []
LOG: Traceback (most recent call last):
LOG:   File "/tmp/logerror.py", line 30, in ?
LOG:     main()
LOG:   File "/tmp/logerror.py", line 27, in main
LOG:     raise RuntimeError("Oops! I've had a problem!")
LOG: RuntimeError: Oops! I've had a problem!
LOG:
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, the exception handler found the exception, grabbed
the information about it and was able to log it. You also can see the
traceback a second time. The raise statement at the end of the
program causes the exception to be raised and handled in the
normal fashion also. This means it aborts your program with
a traceback. Depending on your requirements, you may opt to use
sys.exit() to terminate instead.

Finding Reported Bugs</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have some ways to help users submit good bug reports,
let's look at ways to use those bug reports to track down problems.
Armed with a log and perhaps traceback information, here are some
questions to ask yourself:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Can I duplicate the bug in my environment?
If you can duplicate the problem on your own machine, you're a long
way toward being able to resolve it easily. Use a debugger or
other tool to track it down now that you can trigger it at will.
</p></li><li><p>
Was the input and output what I expected?
Perhaps the user supplied a value you didn't contemplate when you
wrote the program. Or, perhaps a network client or server treats a
protocol slightly differently from what you expected. Maybe the input or
output is itself malformed, and the bug isn't even in your
program. A debug log showing all I/O can be very helpful here.
</p></li><li><p>
Was the program flow as expected?
If your log calls to various functions or methods, you should be
able to trace the flow of execution in a program. Perhaps certain
conditions cause vital code to be skipped, leading to trouble later
on.
</p></li><li><p>
Where was the last point of correct execution?
This may have been right before the error, or perhaps incorrect
data was passed around for some time prior to a crash. Pinpointing
the most recent time in the program's history where it was
functioning normally can help track down the precise place where
things went awry.
</p></li><li><p>
If a traceback is on-hand, does the stack look normal?
Check to make sure the function calls are as expected and that the data
passed to them looks legitimate.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197e8f0"></a>
Preventing Bugs</h2></div></div><p>
All the techniques I've described in this article are useful, but they
shouldn't be deployed in a vacuum. It's also important to adopt
practices that help reduce the likelihood of bugs occurring. Here are
some to consider:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Adopt unit testing. Java, Python, OCaml, Perl and C all have unit
testing frameworks available. Use them and exercise as many code paths
as possible. This is especially important for a language such as Python
where certain executions of a program may not even parse all of your code.
It also can be important for Java; for instance, runtime exceptions can
occur due to improper casting to or from Object.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoid globals. Avoiding global (or class-global) variables helps isolate
problems and helps prevent synchronization issues in multithreaded
programs. Global variables can be the source of unexpected side effects
in function calls, which can be hard to track down.
</p></li><li><p>
Use the right tool for the job.
Languages each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and no
single language is the best tool for every task. For instance,
although Perl makes it easy to parse delimited text files with regular
expressions, OCaml provides tools specifically designed for writing
a compiler. Problems that are expressed easily in one language may
become much more difficult to express in another.
</p></li><li><p>
But, don't use too many different tools.
Most projects benefit from a standardized toolset. Pick a language
and libraries that are most useful for the project at hand, and don't
introduce new ones unless there's a compelling reason to do so.
</p></li><li><p>
Use string and memory management tools.
Many languages, including Java, Python, OCaml, Perl and Ruby, provide
transparent memory management. You do not need to allocate and
deallocate memory. You also do not need to concern
yourself explicitly with end-of-string markers and string size limitations.
Both of these are common problems with C programs that lead to
runtime bugs or security holes. If you must use C, consider a
garbage collection or memory pool library.
</p></li><li><p>
Make it work first, then optimize.
In many cases, it's better to develop working code first, then
optimize it later. Many people optimize first, which does work in
some cases. However, simple, bug-free code is usually more
important than code that is as fast as it can possibly be.
</p></li><li><p>
Write clean code.
Split out code into functions. Write comments. Document what each
function does and its effect on the environment.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x19757b0"></a>
Case Study: a Bug in OfflineIMAP</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP is a program that talks to IMAP servers and synchronizes
an IMAP folder tree with a local tree. Many IMAP servers
exist, and they don't all work exactly the same. Through its
two-year history, OfflineIMAP has gained more and more of the
debugging techniques discussed in this article. Problems that users
encounter often are unreproducible with my particular setup, so
detailed logging is a must. Some IMAP servers are buggy themselves,
so the first question that has to be resolved with many reports is: is
this even a bug in OfflineIMAP? In a surprising number of cases,
the answer is no. OfflineIMAP uses certain IMAP
features that most other IMAP clients do not, and those features tend
to be poorly tested in some servers.
</p><p>
I'd like to walk you through one particularly stubborn OfflineIMAP bug I've
been working on.
About a year ago, someone reported a bug in OfflineIMAP using the
Debian bug-tracking system. Unfortunately, I couldn't duplicate the
problem, and the original submitter didn't have logging turned on when
the problem happened. He also wasn't able to obtain debugging
information. Given the information he did have, which included an
error message, I was able to gather some information following the
steps outlined earlier in this article. I didn't have information on
the input and output, but the program flow and stack both looked
normal. In the end, I was able to determine where the program
crashed but not why, so the bug sat there for a while. Things were
made more difficult because the bug was intermittent&mdash;sometimes the
program would work fine, and occasionally it would crash.
</p><p>
Later, a second person experienced the same problem. He noticed the
existing bug report on Debian and sent in his information.
OfflineIMAP automatically tries to print out parts of a debug log if a
fatal error occurs, and he was able to capture this output. This
OfflineIMAP feature has proven valuable in the past, because it is not
always possible to reproduce the situation leading to a problem.
</p><p>
In this case, the information helped. I was now able to see what
OfflineIMAP was doing immediately prior to the bug occurring. But, it
still was not enough information to discover the exact problem&mdash;everything still looked normal. However, the bug was intermittent,
and he couldn't capture any additional information.
</p><p>
Eventually, a third person experienced the same problem. Again, he
had some information but not quite enough to figure it out.
Something else needed to happen, so I made the logging in the
particular section of code more detailed. Hopefully, with the
additional logging, the next time the problem is encountered, I'll have
enough information to track it down.
</p><p>
Several things played an important role in this process. First,
OfflineIMAP always generates a usable stack trace when a fatal error
occurs. Even the least-detailed report showed exactly where the
program was when it crashed. Secondly, error logs are helpful, but
less so if people can't reproduce a particular bug easily. Printing
out debugging information when a program crashes or malfunctions can
be a useful way to help combat that problem.
</p><p>
Also, the bug-tracking system played an important role in tracking
down the problem. Because Debian bug reports are public, the three
submitters involved were able to identify an outstanding bug report
and add their information to it. This helped everyone to manage the
information related to the particular issue and also provided a place
to start for the people who encountered the problem for the first time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x1975ac8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There are many ways to help your users report bugs in your program
and track them down, but they should not be employed in a vacuum.
Don't forget to make it easy to report and track bugs, and to write clean
code in the first place. Finally, remember that none of these steps are a
magic bullet. Taken together, they can simplify your bug-tracking process
and help find many problems, but they won't necessarily solve everything.
