Break through the complexity of SELinux with a working
example that shows how to add SELinux protection to a simple
network server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this article, we take a look at how SELinux can help increase the
security of networked systems, as well as the design and implementation
of its network-specific security controls. We then walk through an
example of using SELinux policy to lock down a simple network application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217c3f8"></a>
Overview: SELinux Roles, Types and Domains</h2></div></div><p>
SELinux provides strong general security for networked systems. It allows
systems to be locked down tightly so that services have only the minimum set
of rights required to operate. This implementation of the principle of
least privilege helps contain security breaches arising from buggy code,
malicious code, user error and malicious users.
</p><p>
For example, an externally facing Web server
normally might be hardened in a variety of ways, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Disabling unnecessary services.
</p></li><li><p>
Running server software in
chroot jails.
</p></li><li><p>
Local packet filtering with iptables.
</p></li><li><p>
Privilege management with sudo.
</p></li><li><p>
Locking down configuration files.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This is a good, multilayered approach to security,
implementing the principle of defense in depth.
</p><p>
SELinux adds another security layer, mandatory
access control (MAC). Standard SELinux implements
MAC via type enforcement (TE) combined with role-based access control (RBAC), under the control of a
centrally managed security policy, enforced by the
kernel. Unlike traditional UNIX security, normal users
do not have any control over SELinux security policy
(hence the term mandatory), while the superuser,
root, can be split into isolated administrative roles
for authorized users, called separation of duty.
</p><p>
Traditional discretionary access control (DAC) is further restricted
by the TE model, which assigns types to operating system objects
such as processes, files and network resources, then defines rules
for interactions between them. (The type of a process usually
is referred to as a domain.) This allows for fine-grained access control,
extending the principle of least privilege well beyond the scope of
typical OS hardening.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217ca28"></a>
SELinux Network Access-Control Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
SELinux is built upon the LSM (Linux Security
Modules) and Netfilter APIs in the 2.6 kernel. LSM
and Netfilter are both access-control frameworks
consisting of strategically located hook points within
the kernel. Kernel flow is redirected from these hooks
to security modules such as SELinux, which perform
access-control calculations and return a verdict to
the hook. A hook uses the verdict returned from the
security module either to allow normal kernel flow
to continue or prevent it.
</p><p>
One of the core design principles of SELinux is that it mediates access at
the OS object level. Rather than a naive approach where a security
monitor decides whether a program can execute a particular system call
with certain arguments, SELinux looks at the full security context of
the program during execution, the security label attached
to the object being accessed and the action being taken.
For example, <tt  >ls</tt> run by the system administrator
is different from <tt  >ls</tt> run by a normal user.
</p><p>
The general form of an SELinux permission is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
action (source context)
(target context):(target object classes)
permissions
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's an example from SELinux policy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
allow bluetooth_t self:socket listen;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217cd98"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This provides the bluetooth_t domain with the listen permission for
sockets labeled with its own security context. So, a process running in
the bluetooth_t domain is allowed to invoke listen() on a socket
that it owns.
</p><p>
The self designator is simply a shorthand way of
making the target context the same as the source
context. This commonly is used in policy relating to
sockets as they typically are labeled with the same
security context as the creating process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217cef8"></a>
Network Object Labeling</h2></div></div><p>
Under SELinux, objects are labeled with a security context of the
following form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user:role:type
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217d058"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root:staff_r:staff_t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217d1b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is the context of a process being run by root via the staff_r role in
the staff_t domain. The label associated with port 80 is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
system_u:object_r:http_port_t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217d318"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The system_u
user and object_r role are default values for system
objects. It wouldn't make any sense for a port to
have a real user or role; it's not owned by anyone
and it doesn't initiate any actions that require a verdict
from SELinux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217d420"></a>
Sockets</h2></div></div><p>
A socket is labeled by its associated inode and is categorized as
either a generic socket or one of the following socket subclasses:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
UNIX stream.
</p></li><li><p>
UNIX datagram.
</p></li><li><p>
TCP.
</p></li><li><p>
UDP.
</p></li><li><p>
Raw (includes ICMP and other non-TCP/UDP).
</p></li><li><p>
Netlink families.
</p></li><li><p>
Packet.
</p></li><li><p>
Key (pfkeyv2).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Subclasses of sockets can be distinguished in security policy, providing
for fine-grained control and flexibility over different network
protocols:

<pre     class="programlisting">
allow lpd_t printer_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217dbb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This rule allows only a TCP socket created in the lpd_t domain to bind to a
port of type printer_port_t.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x217dcb8"></a>
Ports</h2></div></div><p>
IPv4 and IPv6 ports are labeled implicitly within the kernel, as specified by
policy. The format for labeling port types is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
portcon protocol { port number | port range }
        context
</pre>
</p><p>
The following defines a security context for labeling the standard printer port:

<pre     class="programlisting">
portcon tcp 515 system_u:object_r:printer_port_t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x2174758"></a>
Network Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>
Each network interface (netif) is labeled with a security context, as
specified in policy. Network interfaces are labeled as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
netifcon interface context default_msg_context
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x21748b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The default_msg_context parameter is intended to be used for labeling
messages arriving on the interface, but is not currently used.
</p><p>
Here are some examples of netif labeling in policy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
netifcon eth0 system_u:object_r:netif_intranet_t [...]
netifcon eth1 system_u:object_r:netif_extranet_t [...]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x2174a70"></a>
Nodes</h2></div></div><p>
Under SELinux, a node refers to an IPv4 or IPv6 address and netmask.
It allows host and network addresses to be labeled with security contexts
via policy.
</p><p>
The format for labeling nodes is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nodecon address mask context
</pre>
</p><p>
Here are examples of labeling localhost addresses:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nodecon 127.0.0.1 255.255.255.255
        system_u:object_r:node_lo_t
nodecon ::1   ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
        system_u:object_r:node_lo_t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x2174cd8"></a>
Network Hooks and Permissions</h2></div></div><p>
Access-control hooks are implemented for every socket system call,
allowing all socket-based network protocols to be mediated by
SELinux policy. A few hooks are used only for housekeeping, but
otherwise, hooks generally are used to check one or more access-control permissions.
</p><p>
As there are a large number of generic socket controls, see
Table 1 for the relationships between the hooks,
socket system calls and permissions.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2084580.0x2174e38"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. The Relationships between Hooks, Socket System Calls and
Permissions
</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. The Relationships between Hooks, Socket System Calls and&#10;Permissions&#10;" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

selinux_socket_getsockopt</td><td>getsockopt</td><td>getopt</td></tr><tr><td>selinux_socket_shutdown</td><td>shutdown</td><td>shutdown</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Internally, the socket() system call is decomposed into two hooks.
The selinux_socket_create hook is used to check whether the process can
create a socket of the type requested.
The selinux_socket_post_create management hook is used to assign a
security label and socket class to the newly allocated inode associated
with the socket.
</p><p>
The SELinux permissions also abstract the way system calls and other
operations are viewed from a security point of view. Note, for example,
that the getattr permission is used for the getsockname() and
getpeername() system calls. They are seen to be equivalent
security-wise by SELinux. Similarly, all of the sendmsg()- and
recvmsg()-based system calls are reduced for security management
purposes into simply read and write.
For the curious, the code behind these hooks can be found in the
2.6 kernel, in security/selinux/hooks.c.
</p><p>
As sockets are also files, they inherit some of the access controls
associated with files. Table 2 lists the file-specific
hooks and permissions inherited by sockets.

UNIX Domain Controls</h2></div></div><p>
Under Linux, UNIX domain sockets can be created in an abstract
namespace independent of the filesystem. Additional hooks have
been implemented to allow mediation of communication between UNIX
domain sockets in the abstract namespace, as well as to
provide control over the directionality of UNIX domain communications.
The selinux_socket_unix_stream_connect hook checks the connectto
permission when one UNIX domain socket attempts to establish a
stream connection to another.
The selinux_socket_unix_may_send hook checks the sendto permission
when one UNIX domain socket transmits a datagram to another.
</p><p>
Another feature of UNIX domain sockets under Linux is the ability
to authenticate a peer with the SO_PEERCRED socket option. This
obtains the user ID, group ID and process ID of the peer. Under
SELinux, we also can obtain the security context of a peer via
a new socket option SO_PEERSEC. Calling getsockopt(2) with this
option invokes the selinux_socket_getpeersec hook, which copies
the security context to a buffer passed in by the user. This
is used for local IPC, such as Security-Enhanced DBUS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248a690"></a>
Netlink Controls</h2></div></div><p>
Netlink sockets provide message-based user/kernel communication.
They are used, for example, to configure the kernel routing tables
and IPSec machinery.
</p><p>
Netlink communication is asynchronous; messages can be sent in
one context and received in another. When a Netlink packet is
transmitted, the sender's security credentials in the form of
a capability set are stored with the packet and checked on
reception. This allows, for example, the kernel routing code
to determine whether the user who sent a routing table update
is really permitted to do so.
</p><p>
As part of the LSM Project, capabilities logic was moved out of
the core kernel code and into a security module, so that LSMs
could implement different security models if needed.
</p><p>
The SELinux module uses the selinux_netlink_send hook to copy
only the NET_ADMIN capability to a Netlink packet being sent
to the kernel.
</p><p>
The selinux_netlink_recv hook is invoked when
security-critical messages are received. SELinux uses this hook
to verify that the NET_ADMIN capability was copied to the packet
during transmission and, thus, whether the sending process had
the capability.
</p><p>
An increasing number of Netlink families are being implemented,
and SELinux defines subclasses of Netlink sockets for those that
are security-critical. This allows the socket controls to be
configured on a per-Netlink family basis (for example, to differentiate
routing messages from kernel audit messages).
</p><p>
SELinux also is able to determine, by using the selinux_netlink_send
hook, whether messages on certain types of Netlink sockets are read
or write operations and then apply the nlmsg_read or nlmsg_write
permissions, respectively. This allows fine-grained policy to
specify, for example, that a domain can read the routing table but
not update it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248a9a8"></a>
IPv4 and IPv6 Controls</h2></div></div><p>
SELinux adds several controls for TCP, UDP and Raw socket subclasses.
The node_bind permission determines whether a socket can be bound
to a specific type of node. This obviously is useful only for local
IP addresses and can be used to restrict a d&aelig;mon to binding to a
specific IP address.
</p><p>
The name_bind permission controls whether a socket can bind to
a specific type of port. This permission is invoked only when
the port number falls outside of the local port range. The local
port range is where the kernel automatically allocates port numbers
from (for example, when choosing the source port for an outgoing TCP connection)
and can be configured through the sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range.
On a typical system, this range is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768    61000
</pre>
</p><p>
Thus, name_bind is invoked only when a socket binds to a port
outside this range. SELinux always invokes the permission
for ports below 1024, regardless of the sysctl setting.
Both of these bind-related controls are called from the
selinux_socket_bind hook, which is invoked through the bind(2) system call.
</p><p>
The send_msg and recv_msg permissions are used to control
whether a socket can send or receive messages through a specific
type or port.
</p><p>
A set of permissions is implemented that controls whether packets can
be received or sent over TCP, UDP or Raw sockets for specific types
of netif and node objects. These are tcp_send, tcp_recv,
udp_send, udp_recv, rawip_send and rawip_recv.
</p><p>
These message-based controls are invoked for incoming packets at the
selinux_sock_rcv_skb hook, the first point in the networking stack where
we reliably can associate a packet with a recipient socket. For outgoing
packets, SELinux registers a Netfilter hook and catches them at the IP layer;
outgoing packets still have socket ownership information attached at this
stage.
</p><p>
All of the above controls are protocol-independent in that they operate
on both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248ad18"></a>
Network Policy</h2></div></div><p>
We've covered enough theory now to look at a real
example of SELinux policy for a simple network
application. Due to space limitations and the
complexity of real-world networking, we develop
a policy for a simple TCP echo client.
</p><p>
The source code for the client is available at the
Web site listed in the on-line Resources for this article. Briefly,
it creates a TCP socket, connects to a remote host's
echo port, writes some text and then reads it back.
</p><p>
My workstation has two Ethernet interfaces, and in this example,
eth0 is on an intranet, and the server I am connecting to has the IP
address 10.3.1.2.
</p><p>
Here are the goals of the security policy:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Grant the client only the OS access it absolutely needs.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow the client to communicate only with inetd servers on
the 10.3.1.0/24 subnet via eth0.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248b0e0"></a>
Policy</h2></div></div><p>
The following is an annotated security policy that meets these goals.
To use it, install the SELinux policy sources package for your
distribution, and <tt  >cd</tt> to the top-level directory
(/etc/selinux/strict/src/policy on my workstation).
</p><p>
Create a file called domains/program/echoclient.te, and add these
policy entries as shown in Listing 1.

of policy entries needed. It also helps to use tools like audit2allow,
which takes audit log denial messages and turns them into allow rules.
It would be better to use a high-level GUI policy tool for day-to-day
policy development; we've taken it step by step here to show how
things work.

Testing</h2></div></div><p>
Now, build and label the client executable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make echoclient
cc     echoclient.c   -o echoclient

$ restorecon /tmp/echoclient
</pre>
</p><p>
Verify that it is labeled correctly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ getfilecon /tmp/echoclient
/tmp/echoclient system_u:object_r:echoclient_exec_t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248b9d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You could have used <tt  >ls -Z</tt> instead.
</p><p>
Let's see if it works&mdash;logged in as root in the staff_r role,
using SSH:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ id -Z
root:staff_r:staff_t

$ /tmp/echoclient 10.3.1.2
Sending message: 'Hello, cliche'
Received message: 'Hello, cliche'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248bbe0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It worked!
</p><p>
You can add auditallow rules to the policy to watch each
permission being granted, if you want.
</p><p>
Let's verify that some of the policy rules are actually working.
</p><p>
1) Try to communicate with an IP address outside the intranet.
Route the address locally, so you don't accidentally send a packet
onto the Internet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ip ro add 196.40.74.92 via 10.3.1.2 dev eth0

$ /tmp/echoclient 196.40.74.92
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248be48"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The program gets a TCP timeout, and the following audit
denial message is generated when a packet is sent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
avc:  denied  { tcp_send } for  pid=10831
  exe=/tmp/echoclient saddr=10.3.1.1 src=32822
  daddr=196.40.74.92 dest=7 netif=eth0
  scontext=root:staff_r:echoclient_t
  tcontext=system_u:object_r:node_t
  tclass=node
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x248bfa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As expected, the echoclient_t domain was denied access
to transmit a TCP packet to a /node_t/ node, the default
generic node context.
</p><p>
2) Try to communicate over the wrong interface.
Route the echo server IP via the loopback interface, so
packets will be sent there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
  $ ip ro add 10.3.1.2 via 127.0.0.2 dev lo

  $ /tmp/echoclient 10.3.1.2

avc:  denied  { tcp_send } for pid=10828
  exe=/tmp/echoclient saddr=10.3.1.1 src=32821
  daddr=10.3.1.2 dest=7 netif=lo
  scontext=root:staff_r:echoclient_t
  tcontext=system_u:object_r:netif_lo_t
  tclass=netif
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2084580.0x2709d60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This also is working correctly. The echoclient_t domain was denied access
to transmit a packet over a netif_lo_t netif.
</p><p>
The echoclient program runs with a very minimal set of rights as
defined in the policy. Anything not explicitly allowed is denied.
The potential damage arising from a flaw in the program, user error
or malicious user would be greatly confined by this policy.
</p><p>
This is a simple demonstration of how to meet network security goals
with SELinux policy. A real-world policy would require several extra
features, omitted for space and clarity, such as the ability to use
ICMP messaging and DNS lookups. See the policy sources package of your
distribution for some detailed examples, and also try some of the
GUI policy tools.

Future Developments</h2></div></div><p>
It is likely that some form of labeled networking will be implemented
for SELinux. This is where network traffic itself is labeled and
typically is used in military and government environments dealing with
classified information. An earlier version of SELinux used IP options
to label packets, although it was dropped before merging with the upstream
kernel as the hooks it needed were too invasive. A possible alternative is
to integrate SELinux with IPSec and label the Security Associations (SAs)
instead of the packets. A packet arriving on a specific SA would be
labeled implicitly with the context of the SA. A prototype of this scheme
was implemented for the preceding Flask Project, and it should be useful
as a guideline.
</p><p>
More general integration of SELinux with network security components,
such as cryptography and firewalling, also are areas for future
exploration.
