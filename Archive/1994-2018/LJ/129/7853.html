You aren't supposed to use the same password on
multiple accounts, but with all the servers and Web sites
that require a password,
what's a security-conscious chef to do? Here's how to
make password wrangling both convenient and secure.

Where is that wine order from Henri's Fine Wines,
Fran&ccedil;ois? We seem to be getting low on a couple of my
favorites. Henri is usually right on top of these
things. Did he not give you an order to approve? Ah,
excellent. Then you have the order? No? What do you
mean, it is somewhere safe? You either have it or
you don't? I see. You thought it was important,
so you encrypted the order and threw away the
original message. Let me guess, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, you
do not remember the password you used to encrypt the
message. That's what I thought. All right, show me what
program you used.
</p><p>
Steganography, Fran&ccedil;ois? You used a picture of yourself and
embedded the wine order inside it&mdash;I'm impressed! We will deal with this
problem a little later, Fran&ccedil;ois. There isn't much time, and our guests
will be here any moment. Ah, but they are already here.
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, the world's finest Linux French
restaurant and the home the greatest wine cellar in the world. Of
course, at this moment, it might be only the second best in the world. It
seems my faithful waiter misplaced an order and didn't want to tell
me. Yes, Fran&ccedil;ois, I know you know where it is. Just go down to the
cellar and bring back the 2000 Douro from Portugal. This is a great red,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, a rich and powerful wine with wonderful, dark fruit
flavors and just a hint of mystery. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois!
</p><p>
While Fran&ccedil;ois brings back the wine, let me tell you how he managed not to
misplace the wine order. He used a program called Steghide,
created by Stefan Hetzl, to encode and encrypt the list inside an image,
an image of himself as it turns out (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7853f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Hidden somewhere
in this image is a large order for wine.
</p></div></div><p>
This process is called steganography. Using this process, you can
take any message and encode it inside another message (or in this
case, a graphic image). In fact, you could create a whole Web
site, full of images with secret messages in all of them, and no one
would be the wiser. You can get a copy of Steghide at the Steghide home
page (see the on-line Resources). Contributed binaries are easy
to find. To build from source, Steghide requires the libmhash, libjpeg,
zlib and libmcrypt development libraries; other than that, it's an
easy build that you'll recognize as an extract and build five-step:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf steghide-0.5.1.tar.gz
cd steghide-0.5.1
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to hide the wine replacement order, Fran&ccedil;ois used the following
command to encode the document into his picture:

<pre     class="programlisting">
steghide embed -cf francois.jpg -ef wine_order.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Speaking of wine, Fran&ccedil;ois has returned. If you would be so kind,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, and pour for our guests. Anyhow, immediately upon running the
command, you are asked for a passphrase:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Enter passphrase:
Re-Enter passphrase:
embedding "wine_order.txt" in "francois.jpg"... done
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is an image that still looks as it did before you hid
your secret message inside, but its size will have changed. To recover
the data from the image, you or the person to whom you sent the image
can use the extract argument with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
steghide extract -sf francois.jpg
Enter passphrase:
</pre>
</p><p>
If you successfully entered the right information, the hidden file
is saved to disk. This is precisely where things start to
go wrong. After forgetting the passphrase, there is no way to
retrieve the information. In real life, some of us have, on occasion,
lost our keys. Some people chronically lose their keys, and that's why an
enterprising inventor came up with the idea of putting a beeper on
a keychain. Assuming you don't lose the locator unit, you can push a
button and your keys emit a high-pitched signal telling you which
cushion they've slipped behind.
</p><p>
With passwords, there's a similar idea. The simplest of these is to write
passwords down or keep them in a text file. That's not a particularly
secure method. However, the idea of keeping a list of passwords or
passphrases makes more and more sense as we are asked to remember dozens,
sometimes hundreds of passwords. It might be a lot easier if all we had
to remember was one password, and that's where password managers come
into play.
</p><p>
The first one I ran across was Dennis Pries' Password Management
System or PMS. I like this one because it can run in a text-only
terminal window, which means you can access it through a shell
login from wherever you might be. You can pick the program up from
SourceForge (see Resources), where source and
a Debian package are available.
</p><p>
To build PMS, you have to do a kind of double extract and build
five-step. First, extract the tarred and gzipped bundle (<tt  >tar -xzvf
pms-0.94.tar.gz</tt>). Now, look inside that source directory and you'll
find a contrib directory from which you can build cdk using the
extract and build five-step on that source archive. Once cdk is installed,
go back to the PMS source directory, then build and install that.
</p><p>
The command to use this password manager is <tt  >pms</tt>. When you
run it for the first time, it asks you for a master password.
This is the only password or passphrase you need to remember from
here, but make sure you do. Forget the master key and you won't be able
to get at all those other passwords. Then, PMS provides you with a
simple menu from which you can add, delete or rename a host. These
would be the hosts that you need to log in to. Start by adding
a host (for example, www.somewhere.dom) and then a comment (for example, main production
system). You'll find yourself back at the main menu. From there, choose
User Functions. That's the menu that lets you add or delete user names
associated with whatever hostnames you added in the previous step. You
also can show a user to display the password you thought was lost forever.
</p><p>
Before I move on, I should point out that the hostname and user name
could be anything. For hostname, I could enter &ldquo;school
locker&rdquo;, for
user name &ldquo;combination&rdquo; and for password, the combination
itself. Although
it is intended for recording login information, it works very well for other
things (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7853f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. PMS isn't only for passwords. Store your locker combination too.
</p></div></div><p>
Another thing we tend to forget all the time are the various passwords
we enter for the countless Web sites we visit. From on-line banking to
newspapers that require you to have a free account to read the articles,
the number of accounts we build up over time is staggering. Then, there
are the passwords associated with our instant messaging accounts, e-mail
accounts, FTP sites and more. If there were some way to
maintain and store all this information transparently while we worked, it could
simplify things. Is there such a thing that integrates into
the desktop?
</p><p>
The answer is yes.
With the release of KDE 3.2 and now 3.3, users of the desktop
find that they have a password manager built in. It's
George Staikos' KDE Wallet Manager, and the program that runs it is
kwalletmanager. When you first start the program,
no wallets are created. You will, however, see a small wallet icon appear
in your system tray. If the wallet manager window is not already open,
click on the icon, and a blank box, looking a great deal like an empty
directory folder, appears. Click Settings on the menu bar and select
Configure Wallet.
</p><p>
A new dialog box appears with most items grayed out. Click the check
box that says Enable the KDE Wallet Subsystem. Several other
options now are available to you (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7853f3.large.jpg"><img src="7853f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Configuring
the KDE Wallet Manager to Handle Your Passwords
</p></div></div><p>
Look at the middle section, labeled Automatic Wallet Selection. You're
asked to select the wallet to use as the default. Right below that, you
have the option of selecting another wallet for local passwords (more
on that in a moment). If this is the first time you run the KDE Wallet,
it's unlikely at this point that you have an existing wallet; click New
and enter a name for this wallet when prompted to do so. You simply might
choose to use your name as I did. Once you enter the name and click OK,
the KDE Wallet Manager Wizard appears offering you the basic or advanced
setup, with basic being the recommended choice. In the advanced setup,
there are a few more information screens and you can choose at that time
to create a separate wallet for local passwords. I chose basic and went
for the single wallet.
</p><p>
Whichever you choose, at some point the wizard asks you for a master
password to open the wallet. This is the super-password, the one you don't
want to forget&mdash;the one that opens the door to all the others. Choose
carefully, and make sure the check box labeled &ldquo;Yes, I wish to use the
KDE wallet to store my personal information&rdquo; is checked on.
</p><p>
When you've finished the wizard you almost are done. A new dialog box
pops up telling you that an application (the wizard) has asked
to create a new wallet. You now must confirm this request with the
password for that wallet. Take note of this dialog. You'll see something
similar to it once per KDE session whenever an application wants to open
the wallet to check a password. Until you log out, the wallet now
stays open. In fact, visit a Web site where you are asked for a user name
and password (such as your bank page). After you have entered
the information and clicked Submit or Enter (depending on the form),
a new dialog appears from the KDE Wallet Manager telling you that an
application (in this case, Konqueror) has requested to open the default
wallet (which you just created). Have a look
at Figure 4 to see what I mean.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7853f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Your master
password must be entered to open the wallet.
</p></div></div><p>
Enter your master password and click to continue. You'll get one final
warning telling you that this encrypted information is about to be saved
and asking for your confirmation. Click Yes. Now, look down in your
system tray, and you'll see that the icon shows a slightly open wallet
where before it was closed.
</p><p>
The beauty of this particular system is that all the information is
entered magically for you next time you visit a site. This is true of
any KDE application that asks you for a password, such as your instant
messenger.
</p><p>
There is one catch, however, and it is a big one. As I mentioned,
you'll need to enter your master password only once per KDE session, and
that makes things easy. But beware: now that you've got your system
automatically filling in passwords for you, securing your desktop becomes
important. Make sure you lock your desktop before you walk away. Another
way to do this is to go back into the KDE Wallet configuration dialog
and look at some of the Close Wallet options. You can set it to close
automatically after a defined period of time, like when the screensaver starts
(when you normally would be away) or when the last application using
it is closed. Doing it that way, you have one less thing to remember.
</p><p>
Judging by the clock on the wall, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it appears that
closing time is once again upon us. As you can see, there are a number
of alternatives for storing password information so that you do not have
to remember dozens or hundreds of cryptic letter and number combinations.
Perhaps if we can convince Fran&ccedil;ois to use a tool like this in the future,
there won't be any more lost orders. In the meantime, I'm sure we can
convince him to refill our guests' glasses one more time. And don't worry
about the wine supply. I personally will make sure the wine cellar is
fully stocked when we next meet. Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, let
us all drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
