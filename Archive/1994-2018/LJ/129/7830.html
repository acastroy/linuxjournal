While big-name companies scramble to protect business
models, this company is making open-ended devices
that give customers the right to control their own
telephone and media experiences.

In January 2003, after a big PR buildup
that included coverage in Reuters and <span   class="emphasis"><em>USA Today</em></span>,
Kunitake Ando, president and CEO of Sony, announced
in a keynote to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES)
that his company and Matsushita would lead the rest
of the industry's giants into a future of &ldquo;always on&rdquo;
and interactive devices running a new Linux distro.
</p><p>
That following July, LinuxDevices wrote, &ldquo;What began
as a small but powerful call for an embedded Linux
collaboration among Japanese consumer electronics
(CE) manufacturers last December turned into a roar
today, as eight consumer electronics powerhouses
proclaimed the establishment of the CE Linux Forum
(CELF).&rdquo; Members included Sony, Matsushita, NEC,
Philips, Samsung, Sharp and Toshiba. Later, the
roster grew to include IBM, Mitsubishi, Metrowerks,
Motorola, Nokia, LSI Logic, HP, Fujitsu, Hitachi,
Phoenix, Sanyo and MontaVista.
</p><p>
Naturally, I expected to hear an even bigger roar for
Linux at CES/2004 the following January. Instead,
out of more than 3,000 exhibitors, only
11 bothered to mention Linux in their show guide
texts. Except for RealNetworks, none of them were
A-list companies. Today, the CELF site appears
moribund. The copyright says 2003&ndash;2004. The last
update was in February 2004. When I write to the
e-mail address on the site, I hear nothing back.
</p><p>
So, rather than a great roar by a choir of giants,
CELF instead looks like what old hands in Silicon
Valley call a Barney agreement. That's where
&ldquo;partners&rdquo; say &ldquo;I love you, you love me&rdquo;, and not
much else happens.
</p><p>
Even if CELF eventually does produce a working
distro, it reminds us in the meantime that Linux
is fundamentally a grass-roots phenomenon. It's
bottom-up, not top-down. I don't mean to discredit
IBM, HP, Novell, Oracle or any of the other BigCos
that promote Linux, support its development and fly
the penguin flag. I do mean to credit the little
guys who not only develop Linux, but deploy it in
the marketplace. Especially the ones who deliver
and not merely promise.
</p><p>
Take Unication, one of the
11 exhibitors waving the penguin flag at
CES/2004. Unication is a Taiwan-based company that
has, among other things, made Motorola pagers for
the past 13 years. Unication recently
has branched into building wireless gateways, servers,
VoIP products and PDAs, all leveraging Linux's virtues
as free and highly useful building material. The
result is some very capable stuff, unencumbered by
the product marketing strategies practiced
by Unication's giant competitors.
</p><p>
Case in point: Unication's SC-203, an 802.11g-based
router that delivers seven Web services in one
device: Web, e-mail, printing, voice over IP (VoIP),
VPN, firewall and media streaming, including MP3
audio and MPEG video. It's not hard to imagine the
possibilities. Best of all, it doesn't come with
any big vendor's digital rights management (DRM)
or proprietary software lock-in. It's a box of open
standards, ready to use. So, when you think about
uses, you don't have to wonder what Sony or Philips
or Apple or HP has stuck in there to please their
lawyers and &ldquo;content partners&rdquo; while keeping you from
doing any darn thing you want.
</p><p>
For example, the SC-203's VoIP SIP server, which
works like a proxy server, supports VoIP calls over
wired or wireless (Wi-Fi) connections. Users can
make VoIP calls from any open Wi-Fi hotspot, through
the SC-203. VoIP calls require paired FXS (phone)
and FXO (line) devices. These are available from
a variety of makers. Unication's server-side VoIP
gateway is the WG-205, which comes in two models:
one with two FXS ports and the other with one FXS
(phone) and one FXO (line) port. The WG-205's default
server IP points to the SC-203. Private IPs are
permitted behind the SC-203 to make VoIP calls. The
WG-205 either can connect to the SC-203 LAN port or
connect independently through an ISP, as long as the Net
is available.
</p><p>
The company also makes a Wi-Fi and Ethernet-based VoIP
phone you can carry on the road. The U-Phone features
include call holding, call forwarding, caller ID,
configurable ring tones and melodies, a FIFO log of
the last ten calls and the ability to redial any of
them. It has a talk time of 2.5 hours and a standby
time of 30 hours. So you carry a VoIP phone number
wherever you go, ready for use when you're within
Wi-Fi range of the Internet. You need some smarts to
make it all work, but there's an influential market
(that would include <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers) for whom
that's exactly the idea.
</p><p>
Several years ago, David Isenberg famously got
himself fired from AT&amp;T by writing a landmark essay
titled &ldquo;The Rise of the Stupid Network&rdquo;. It was
an argument for reversing the phone company's
traditional approach, which was to maximize
(preferably proprietary) intelligence inside the
network and to restrict available use of the network
by attached devices. Isenberg said the ideal model
instead was making the network as stupid as possible
in the middle, supporting unlimited and unrestricted
intelligence connected from the outside. In other
words, he wanted AT&amp;T to build services that respected
the wisdom of the Net's end-to-end architecture.
</p><p>
What Isenberg recommended was the corporate equivalent of a sex change,
and AT&amp;T couldn't bear to think of it. Smart middles always have been
the telco and cable-carrier equivalent of the top-down
producer-to-consumer worldview of every large producer in the
Industrial Age. Smart-middle thinking is what accounts for the
asymmetries of your cable and DSL connections. Asymmetrical bandwidth
(fat-down, thin-up) certainly can be justified by typical usage
patterns. But they're also deployed to restrict customers to the roles
of consumers. There is no evidence that the prospect of consumers is
even thinkable to most telephone and cable companies. Never mind that
many of the Net's own infrastructural building materials, including
countless servers running the LAMP suite on Linux, are products of the
demand side, supplying itself.
</p><p>
So is it any surprise that we've hardly heard a peep about CELF? The
very notion of &ldquo;consumer electronics&rdquo; presumes restricted autonomy on
the demand side. Whatever CELF produces, we can be sure Linux in most
cases will be too deeply embedded to serve as a freely useful platform
for anybody other than the manufacturer. I hope they prove me wrong, but
I'm not holding my breath.
</p><p>
Back at last year's CES, the coolest device I saw was Unication's Magic
PDA. It's three devices in one: a PDA, an MP3 player and a VoIP phone.
At the time of this writing, the phone uses only the G.711 codec, which typically
is used for intranet calls. The next phase, I'm told, will implement all
VoIP properties, including the support of G.723.1, G.729, G.726 and
G.711u/a codecs, plus electronics to cancel echoes and suppress noise.
What I instantly loved about it, however, was its ability to broadcast
MP3 files on any frequency of the FM radio band, so you can listen to it
on a car radio or home audio system.
</p><p>
I normally don't like to plug any company, but Solon Lee of
Unication has been a helpful and patient correspondent while I worked on
this piece, and I love to see pioneering companies like his compete in a
market dominated by roaring giants. Especially when those giants
make only noises where their products ought to be. If you can help Solon and
his company find regional agents and distributors, anywhere in the
world, drop a note to Unication at
<a href="mailto:salesenquiry@uni.com.tw">salesenquiry@uni.com.tw</a>.
</p><p>
I'm also interested in progress reports on CELF and anything else
anybody is doing with Linux at CES/2005. I'll be there, rooting for the
roots.
