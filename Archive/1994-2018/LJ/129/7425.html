When it comes to Linux and UNIX, I'm not into convenience. Doing it all
by hand or with a script, if the task is repetitive, always has been a
better choice.
Traditionally, I've been leery of GUIs that
automate tasks. If you ever have experienced
System Administration Manager (SAM) under HP-UX,
you know what I mean. In general it works okay, but
it has bitten back enough times to make me consider
alternatives that offer a greater degree of reliability
and consistency. My experience with open source
and Linux has been mostly positive so far, and this fact
has made me more receptive to trying things I otherwise might
not have bothered with, such as Webmin.
</p><p>
Before installing Webmin, I read a couple of
chapters in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing Linux Systems with Webmin</em></span> to
get a feel for it, and then proceeded to check out
the <a href="http://webmin.com" target="_self">webmin.com</a> Web site. The Web site is not merely the obvious
place to start; it also is well documented and provided me everything I
needed to know in getting started. I followed all the steps from installation
to initial login. It seemed too easy.
</p><p>
Once I logged in I was presented with a number of icons that represent
the management subsystems (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7425f1.large.jpg"><img src="7425f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The System module contains a rich sysadmin task environment.
</p></div></div><p>
Eighty-plus modules are present in Webmin, and they vary in
complexity. As with anything, it is a good idea to start with
baby steps and then move on, but the first thing one should do upon
entering the new environment is to secure it.
</p><p>
I was able to log in as root after the initial installation of Webmin,
and this generates a certain amount of paranoia on my part.
If you have put Webmin on a server, you should secure it,
and this is where the book may come in handy. Chapter 3
walks the reader through a few steps to secure the box, but one
is better advised to become familiar with Webmin configuration and
access,
topics covered in Chapters 51 and 52.
</p><p>
I've opted not to secure my machine as best I can, but that doesn't mean
I don't want to know who was logged on when and why. By default, root's
actions are logged, so if you have several folks using root, you can
look at what they did.
In Figure 2, one can see from the IP addresses that the root user was logged in from different
clients.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7425f2.large.jpg"><img src="7425f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The logs clearly show what root has been doing and from where.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de8580.0x1ee0d98"></a>
Exploring the Modules</h2></div></div><p>
Modules is a topic larger than what I can cover in the scope of this article,
but I mention a few of the modules so we can sample the span of
Webmin. The first of these modules after the Webmin (configuration) one is the System
module.
The first of the subsystems to look at is Bootup and Shutdown.
The page should display Actions, Start At
Boot and Description columns. This enables you to quickly
disable services. For example, I typically disable sendmail by starting
on this test box, unless I have a specific need for messaging. You should
notice a red No in the Start At Boot column (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7425f3.large.jpg"><img src="7425f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The list of services to start is long and varied.
</p></div></div><p>
Farther on down is vncserver, which
is enabled to run at boot time. If I were to change this, I would
check the box at left and then click on vncserver.
</p><p>
With that, a new page would load that displays, in editable form, the
vncserver startup script (Figure 4). This page allows for stopping,
starting, restarting, setting boot time start and editing the
file. Once you save or delete the action, you return to the Bootup
and Shutdown page.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7425f4.large.jpg"><img src="7425f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Editing and testing services from within Webmin is
straightforward and easy.
</p></div></div><p>
Jumping to another module, Hardware, and then to the Grub Boot Loader
subsystem, I easily am able to set the boot kernel of choice and the delay
I want. This is an easy task, one that could have been done equally as easily
from the command line, but the GUI conveys more
information in an intuitive manner than does text.
If the GUI is reliable,
it is desirable as a tool.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de8580.0x1ee1318"></a>
From Simple to Complex</h2></div></div><p>
Many of the subsystems are fairly intuitive, and it will be easy for
the user to grasp and use them immediately, but some are complicated.
The book comes in handy in navigating modules
such as Apache, but it assumes that you already understand the
applications.
</p><p>
A fair question to ask is whether the benefits of Webmin are worth the learning curve to
use it. This would depend on
the support environment in which you are working. Webmin certainly is a convenient
tool and a time-saver, but it is not a substitute for understanding the
inner workings of the OS. Will I continue to use it and learn more about
it? Yes.
</p><p>
The book initially reminded me of a college textbook
when I first picked it up. At 700+ pages there is
a lot of information here and it is geared toward
a serious user. It exhaustively covers the modules
and walks you through what you need to know. I would
recommend it to anyone who plans to use Webmin as a
management tool.
