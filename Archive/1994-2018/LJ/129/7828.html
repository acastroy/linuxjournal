More and more Web sites are offering machine-friendly
versions of their services. Here's an example of a simple
but useful service&mdash;updates on new Web site content.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd93a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we looked at ways in which we can gather, or aggregate,
content from a number of different Web sites and put together a
single summary of the day's news. Although it was amazing to see how
much we could accomplish with a little bit of code, the application
I presented is merely a toy when compared with actual aggregators.
My example application supports only one user, is controlled by a primitive configuration
file, doesn't categorize Weblogs into groups, checks for Weblog
updates only when we explicitly ask it to do so and doesn't check for or
handle errors.
</p><p>
Creating a robust, user-friendly aggregator is beyond the
scope of this column, given the attention to technical
and design details that would be necessary. But several days before I
sat down to write this column, something amazing happened. The free,
Web-based Bloglines.com aggregation service, which many people use to
keep track of their favorite Weblogs, announced the availability of a
Web service API that allows independent developers to create and
deploy applications that use the data and applications developed by
Bloglines.
The publication and availability of the Bloglines API marks the
growing popularity of Web services among well-known sites and opens
the door to new applications built on the underlying Bloglines
infrastructure.
</p><p>
This month, we take a look at the Bloglines API, including the
creation of a simple application based on it. The API is brand new as
of this writing (early October 2004) and undoubtedly will evolve as more
people use it. If Weblogs interest you, and if you still are waiting
to see practical uses for Web services, this combination of events
might have come just in time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd9558"></a>
What Is a Web Service, Anyway?</h2></div></div><p>
The basic idea behind Web services is quite simple: the Web's success
is due in no small part to the fact that the client and server
operating systems are irrelevant. So long as the client and server
adhere to the HTTP and HTML specifications, they can communicate
seamlessly. Linux has made inroads into the server space precisely
for this reason.
</p><p>
Web services take this one step further, saying that computers and
not people should be the biggest users of the Web.
Although computers exchange information over HTTP, they send and
receive data in XML, the markup language or meta-language, that has
caught on like wildfire in recent years. If my computer can send XML
in the HTTP request it sends to your computer, and your computer then
returns XML in its HTTP response, we can exchange information
regardless of what languages and operating systems we're using.
</p><p>
The original form of this service, known as XML-RPC, still exists and is
great for fast, easy communication. But this idea was extended
further, and a variety of data types, error-checking
mechanisms and object serialization techniques were introduced that XML-RPC lacked.
This extension became known as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).
SOAP theoretically can run on top of a variety of protocols, but it
most often is sent on top of HTTP.
</p><p>
SOAP is a great solution to many problems, except that it is terribly
complex, can be slow and is difficult to implement. And, both
XML-RPC and SOAP require that the HTTP request include a well-formed
XML request containing the query. One response to this growing
complexity is REST (representational state transfer), in which all
transactions are initiated by a simple HTTP GET request and all
parameters are specified in the URL itself. The response then is an
XML document containing the records and fields appropriate to the
request. All of the Bloglines API calls are done with REST, although
it's hard to say if this reflects the relatively simple queries
now provided or if it's a design preference of the developers.
</p><p>
Although Web services probably are taking off behind corporate doors,
only a few of the larger Web sites have made their plans and APIs
public. The best-known examples are some of the largest and
most profitable sites on the Web, including Amazon, eBay and
Google. eBay charges for access to its Web services, with annual fees
as well as per-transaction costs. By contrast, Amazon and Google have
made their APIs freely available to the public, subject to usage
restrictions and without making any promises regarding future availability.
</p><p>
In making its API public, Bloglines is indicating its interest
in creating the same sort of developer community that Amazon, Google
and eBay have created. This move also demonstrates its interest in
remaining a leader in the world of Weblog aggregation and
applications. Given Google's purchase of Blogger several years ago
and the extensive search features that Bloglines is
making available with its API, we might be witnessing the
beginning of a new type of application or platform battle, with the
Google and Bloglines APIs competing for attention.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd9818"></a>
Presenting the Bloglines API</h2></div></div><p>
Bloglines aggregates content from a
large number of Weblogs and frequently updated news sources.
Bloglines is happy to accept feeds in a variety of formats, including
Atom and several versions of RSS. Indeed, Bloglines offers
subscribers the choice of which feed to use, if more than one is
available. The Bloglines software then archives that content,
providing a search interface for interested users. Bloglines provides
some relevance features, telling subscribers which additional Weblogs
might interest them. Finally, Bloglines lets you look at other users'
subscriptions; if you are interested in seeing which Weblogs interest
me, you can review my profile and see my subscriptions.
</p><p>
For now at least, much of this functionality remains under wraps,
available only through the Bloglines Web site. But three particular
pieces of functionality now are available from the Bloglines Web
services API:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Notifier: if you are a Bloglines subscriber and want to know when
new content has arrived from one or more of the Weblogs to which you
subscribe, now you can do it. This is the most established of the
Bloglines Web services, and a number of tools for a number of
operating systems and windowing toolkits rely on this interface to
provide updates.
</p></li><li><p>
Sync API: allows you to retrieve information about a
particular user's subscriptions, as well as the latest entries from
each of those subscriptions. You can think of this as the data
underlying the HTML that Bloglines generates for the main Weblog
listing it provides.
</p></li><li><p>
Blogroll API: presents a way to retrieve and display a
particular user's subscription list.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdd9be0"></a>
Notifier API</h2></div></div><p>
As I wrote above, Bloglines has decided to use REST for all of its
Web services APIs. This means every request consists of a
single URL, with all of the parameters and their values in the URL.
Information is returned in whatever format the server deems
appropriate. This stands in sharp contrast to SOAP, which specifies
the name and type of each parameter and return value. A minor
exception to this rule is that APIs requiring authentication expect
the user name and password to arrive in HTTP Basic rather than in the
URL itself. In the Bloglines universe, subscribers are identified by
their e-mail addresses and user-selected passwords.
</p><p>
The easiest of the APIs to understand and use is the Notifier. To
invoke the Notifier, simply go to the URL
rpc.bloglines.com/update?user=reuven@lerner.co.il&amp;ver=1.
The response, while (incorrectly) tagged by the server as having a
MIME type of text/html, contains a plain-text response of the format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
|A|B|
</pre>
</p><p>
Notifiers can interpret the response as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Normally, A indicates the number of unread Weblog entries in
the user's subscription.
</p></li><li><p>
If the provided e-mail address is not registered with the system,
then A contains -1.
</p></li><li><p>
If B isn't empty, it then contains a URL pointing to an upgrade
page. The documentation doesn't say much about what it means to
have an upgrade page. I assume that such a page is meant for
people rather than programs, because it would be impossible or at
least quite difficult to identify all of the programs that use the
Notifier API and that are in need of an upgrade.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We easily could implement the client side of the Notifier API in any
modern high-level language. But at the time of this writing,
versions of Bloglines client libraries exist in Perl, Python and Ruby. I
use the Perl version (on CPAN as WebService::Bloglines), but you
may feel more comfortable rolling your own version, using a different
version or both.
</p><p>
Here is a simple command-line program that prints &ldquo;You have new
blogs!&rdquo; if Bloglines reports that new messages are waiting and
&ldquo;No
new blogs&rdquo; if I already have read everything:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/perl

use WebService::Bloglines;

my $username = 'reuven@lerner.co.il';
my $password = 'MYPASS';

my $bloglines = WebService::Bloglines-&gt;new(
                           username =&gt; $username,
                           password =&gt; $password);

my $unread_blogs = $bloglines-&gt;notify();

if ($unread_blogs)
{
print "You have '$unread_blogs' new blogs!\n ";
}
else
{
print "No new blogs.\n"
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The number returned by <tt  >$bloglines-&gt;notify()</tt> is the number
of unread postings, not of unread Weblogs. If there are 15 unread
messages from five Weblogs, <tt  >$bloglines-&gt;notify()</tt>
returns 15, not
5. Moreover, the number reflects the state of the internal Bloglines
database. That is, if you click on the Keep New check box at
the bottom of a Weblog entry, it is included in the count of
new messages returned by <tt  >$bloglines-&gt;notify()</tt>.
</p><p>
If we enter an incorrect user name, our program exits with a fatal
error and indicates that we gave it a bad user name. Giving a bad
password has no consequences for the Notifier API, because that
information is available publicly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce1580.0xdda3c8"></a>
Blogroll API</h2></div></div><p>
Another offering from Bloglines, as we mentioned earlier, is the
Blogroll API. A blogroll is a list of Weblogs that a particular
author finds interesting and often reads. It's likely that if you
enjoy reading someone's Weblog, you also would enjoy perusing
that person's reading list. In the case of Bloglines, a
blogroll simply is a list of subscriptions associated with a
particular user.
</p><p>
So far, we have mentioned that someone's Bloglines user name is the
same as his or her e-mail address. But this is not completely true&mdash;if
you choose to use Bloglines for your own private purposes, never
sharing information about your subscriptions with other people,
you need nothing more than your e-mail address. But if you do want to
expose your subscriptions, you must choose a user name with which
they can be associated. In my case, my registration e-mail address
is reuven@lerner.co.il and my user name is reuven. This
distinction wasn't clear to me for the first few months that I
used Bloglines, although it seems to be more obviously advertised
now.
</p><p>
If a user has established a user name for public consumption and if
that user has chosen to share his or her subscriptions, you can get a
version of that user's Blogroll that uses HTML and JavaScript as
follows: http://www.bloglines.com/public/reuven.
If we want to retrieve the blogroll results in HTML, we can do so with
the following style of URL:
http://rpc.bloglines.com/blogroll?id=reuven&amp;html=1.
</p><p>
But the whole idea of Web services is to make data machine-readable,
such that it can be stored and processed by computers. OPML, the
Outline Processor Markup Language, specified by Dave Winer in 2000, is
the format used by Bloglines when it exports a list of subscriptions.
It is not an official part of the Bloglines Web services
specification, but you can retrieve it by going to the following type of
URL: http://www.bloglines.com/export?id=reuven.
</p><p>
In all of the above examples, you can and should
replace my Bloglines user name with that of the user whose blogroll you
want to read. Not every user makes his or her subscription list
public, so you may encounter error messages when trying to
retrieve them. And once you retrieve the OPML, you need to
process it, perhaps using a tool such as the publicly available
XML::OPML module from CPAN.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, the Bloglines API for Web services opens the door to a
host of third-party applications. It increasingly is possible to
create useful applications that use HTML, XML and HTTP but that are
not tied to a Web browser. The Notifier and Blogroll APIs are only
the beginning. As we saw earlier, there is also a Sync API that
effectively allows developers to create alternative GUIs and
applications with the actual content Bloglines retrieves and
stores. In my next column, we will look at the Sync API, building some basic
applications on top of the Bloglines infrastructure.
