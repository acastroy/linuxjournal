If you have personal publicly accessible Web sites and/or publicly
accessible SSH services, you should take steps to limit your risks by
adding a simple, yet effective two-factor solution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbf580.0x1eb71f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you run a publicly accessible Web server for your own use (and let's
face it, if you're reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, there's a very good chance you
do), how do you go about limiting the risk of someone accessing your
site and doing bad things? How about SSH, an even bigger concern? In
today's world, it's imperative to think about your exposure and take
steps to limit as much risk as possible.
</p><p>
In this tutorial, I walk through the steps necessary to implement
a home-grown two-factor authentication system for accessing your Web
sites and for SSH access.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbf580.0x1eb7460"></a>
The Infrastructure and the &ldquo;Challenge&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>
Running your own hardware can be a pain in the neck. After dealing with
hardware failures, such as failed fans, failed power supplies, bad hard
disks and the like, you finally may decide to dump your co-lo or bedroom
closet and your hardware and jump into the world of elastic computing.
One such option is Amazon's EC2 platform, which offers a variety of
Linux flavors and has one of the most robust and mature cloud platforms
available. I'm not an Amazon representative, but I'm the first
to say <span   class="emphasis"><em>try it</em></span>. It's amazing stuff, and a micro instance is free for
a year.
</p><p>
In the test scenario for this article, I use an Amazon EC2 server running Ubuntu
12.04 LTS to host a couple Web applications. If you use a different
flavor of Linux, the instructions easily can be adapted to meet your
specific needs. Let's assume the applications are, for the most part,
for personal use only. If the sites were accessed only from work or
home, you simply could secure the sites by creating firewall rules to
allow Web traffic from only those IP addresses. This, incidentally,
is exactly how one should secure SSH. 
</p><p>
Let's assume though that this won't
work for your Web apps because you do a fair amount of traveling and need
to be able to access those applications while you're on the road, so
a couple firewall rules won't help you. Let's also assume that your
applications have their own security systems, but you still want an extra
layer of security. 
</p><p>
You could have set up a VPN server, but every once
in a while, you might like to give a family member access to one of your
sites, so a VPN approach wouldn't work. 
</p><p>
Another consideration is Google
Authenticator for true two-factor authentication. You certainly could go
down this path, but you're looking for something you can do
yourself&mdash;something that is self-contained and yours. 
</p><p>
Just like so many things in
the Linux world, where there's a will, there's a way! It turns out you
easily can set up your own, homegrown, two-factor solution and use it to
control access to your Web apps and SSH, while also making it possible
to allow occasional access to your sites by other users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbf580.0x1eb7828"></a>
Apache Authentication and Authorization</h2></div></div><p>
Since the Web server for this example is Apache, let's leverage the server's
authentication and authorization capabilities to ask for a set of
credentials before any of your sites are served up to a user.
</p><p>
In the interest of keeping things simple, and since you will follow best
practice and allow only https traffic to and from your Web server, let's
use the <tt  >mod_auth_basic</tt> module for authentication. 
</p><p>
Start by
becoming root and installing Apache on your fresh Ubuntu install:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo su
apt-get install apache2
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's assume your Web applications run in subfolders off of the main www
document folder. This allows you to take care of all your sites at once
by creating a single .htaccess file in the http server root folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /var/www/.htaccess
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's add a few lines that tell Apache to require authentication
and where to look for the password file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AuthType Basic
AuthName "restricted area"
AuthUserFile /home/ubuntu/.htpasswd
require valid-user
</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, you now need to change the ownership of the file so
the Apache process can read its contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chown www-data:www-data /var/www/.htaccess
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to create the .htpasswd file that you reference in your
.htaccess file and configure its ownership so the Web server can read it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
htpasswd -cb /home/ubuntu/.htpasswd jameslitton test123
chown www-data:www-data /home/ubuntu/.htpasswd
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you need to tell Apache to require authentication and to use the
<tt  >mod_auth_basic</tt> module for that purpose:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you need to change <tt  >AllowOverride None</tt> to
<tt  >AllowOverride AuthConfig</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Service apache2 restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Visiting your site now prompts for a user name and password (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11619f1.large.jpg"><img src="11619f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbf580.0x1eb8220"></a>
One-Time Day Password/PIN</h2></div></div><p>
The approach I'm going to take here is to have your secondary authentication password
change daily instead of more frequently. This allows the
<tt  >mod_auth_basic</tt>
approach described above to work. I won't go into the details here,
but suffice it to say that every time the password changes, an immediate
re-authentication is required, which is not the behavior you want.
</p><p>
Let's go with a six-digit numeric pin code and have that delivered
to a mobile phone at midnight every night. I'm a big fan of Pushover,
which is a service that pushes instant notifications to mobile phones and
tablets from your own scripts and application.
</p><p>
To set this up, create a bash script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /home/ubuntu/2fac.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Now add the following lines:


<pre     class="programlisting">
1  #!/bin/bash
2  ppwd=`od -vAn -N4 -tu4 &lt; /dev/urandom | tr -d '\n' | tail -c 6`
3  curl -s -F "token=id" -F "user=id" -F "message=$ppwd"
    &#8618;https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
4  htpasswd -b /home/ubuntu/.htpasswd jameslitton $ppwd
5  echo $ppwd | base64 &gt;/home/ubuntu/.2fac
</pre>
</p><p>
Line 2 produces a random six-digit PIN code and assigns it to a variable
called ppwd. Line 3 sends the PIN to the Pushover service for delivery
to your mobile phone. Line 4 updates the .htpasswd file with the new
password, and last but not least, Line 5 stores a copy of the PIN in a
format that you can recover, as you will see later on.
</p><p>
Now save the script, and make it executable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x /home/ubuntu/2fac.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
To complete this solution, all you need to do is schedule the script to run,
via cron, at midnight each night:

<pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -e
00 00 * * * /home/ubuntu/2fac.sh
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbf580.0x1eb8748"></a>
Making It Web-Accessible</h2></div></div><p>
You certainly could leave it there and call it done, but suppose you didn't
receive your code and want to force a change. Or, perhaps you gave
someone temporary access to your site, and now you want to force a password
change to ensure that that person no longer can access the site. You always
could SSH
to your server and manually run the script, but that's too hard. 
Let's
create a Web-accessible PHP script that will take care of this for you.
</p><p>
To start, change the ownership of your 2fac.sh script so your Web
server can run it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chown www-data:www-data /home/Ubuntu/2fac.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you need to create a new folder to hold your script and create the
PHP script itself that allows a new &ldquo;key&rdquo; to be run manually:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkdir /vaw/www/twofactor
vim /var/www/twofactor/index.php 

1  &lt;?php
2  exec('/home/ubuntu/2fac.sh');
3  header('Location: http://www.google.com');
4  ?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Because it's conceivable that you're needing to force a new key because
you didn't receive the previous one, you need to make sure the folder
that holds this script does not require authentication. To do that,
you need to modify the Apache configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl
</pre>
</p><p>
Now add the following below the Directory directive for /var/www:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Directory /var/www/twofactor/&gt;
        satisfy any
&lt;/Directory&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's configure ownership and restart Apache:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/twofactor
Service apache2 restart
</pre>
</p><p>
So thinking this through, it's conceivable that the Pushover service
could be completely down. That would leave you in a bad situation where
you can't access your site. Let's build in a contingency for exactly
this scenario.
</p><p>
To do this, let's build a second script that grabs a copy of your PIN
(remember the .2fac file that you saved earlier) and e-mails it to you. In
this case, let's use your mobile carrier's e-mail to SMS bridge to SMS
the message to you.
</p><p>
Start by installing mailutils if you haven't done so already, and be
sure to select the Internet option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install mailutils
</pre>
</p><p>
Now create the second script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /home/Ubuntu/2fac2.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Then add the code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
ppwd=`cat /home/ubuntu/.2fac | base64 --decode`
echo " " | mail -s $ppwd xxx5551212@vtext.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't forget to change the file's ownership:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chown www-data:www-data /home/ubuntu/2fac2.sh
chown www-data:www-data /home/ubuntu/.2fac
</pre>
</p><p>
With that out of the way, now you need to modify the PHP script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /var/www/twofactor/index.php 
</pre>
</p><p>
Replace line 2 with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
2  if (isset($_GET["sms"])) {
3    exec('/home/ubuntu/2fac2.sh');
4    } else {
5    exec('/home/ubuntu/2fac.sh');
6    }
</pre>
</p><p>
Then create two bookmarks, so that any time you want to generate a new PIN
and have it sent to you via Pushover, you simply can click the link and
it's done. The second bookmark will send a copy of the existing PIN to
the e-mail address of your choice in the unlikely event that the Pushover
service is unavailable.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
2Factor = https://www.thelittonfamily.com/twofactor/index.php
</p></li><li><p>
2Factor&mdash;SMS = https://www.thelittonfamily.com/twofactor/index.php?sms=1
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dbf580.0x22b1548"></a>
Extending to SSH</h2></div></div><p>
Extending this solution to cover SSH is really pretty simple. The key
is to use the little-known <tt  >ForceCommand</tt> directive in your sshd_config
file. This forces the SSH d&aelig;mon to run a script before spanning the
terminal session.
</p><p>
Let's start with the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /home/ubuntu/tfac-ssh.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Now add the following lines:


<pre     class="programlisting">
1  #!/bin/bash
2  code=`cat .2fac | base64 --decode`
3  echo -ne "Enter PIN: "
4  while IFS= read -r -s -n1 pass; do
5    if [[ -z $pass ]]; then
6       echo
7       break
8    else
9       echo -n '*'
10      input+=$pass
11   fi
12 done
13 if [ $code = $input ];
14 then
15   sleep 1
16   clear
17   /bin/bash
18 else
19   sleep 1
20   curl -s -F "token=id" -F "user=id" -F "message=$input"
      &#8618;https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json
21 fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Line 2 loads the PIN into a variable. Lines 3&ndash;12 prompt for the PIN
and echo a star back for each key press. Line 13 compares the user's
input to the PIN. If they match, lines 14&ndash;17 clear the screen and start a
bash session. If the user's input does not match the PIN, lines 18&ndash;21
send a notification to Pushover so you know a failure occurred and
then ends the session.
</p><p>
Let's configure the SSH d&aelig;mon to run the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</pre>
</p><p>
Now add the following to the top of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ForceCommand /home/ubuntu/tfac-ssh.sh
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11619f2.large.jpg"><img src="11619f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Two-Factor Request from SSH
</p></div></div><p>
This approach works great. The only limitation is no backspaces. If
you press the wrong key, your session will be terminated, and you'll
have to try again.
</p><p>
There you have it, a poor-man's two-factor authentication implementation
with very little effort and from my experience, it's rock solid!
