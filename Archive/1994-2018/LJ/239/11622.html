<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> issue #1 featured Linus Torvalds' announcement
of a code freeze for Linux 1.0, alongside an article comparing Linux to its
32-bit competitors of the day: Windows NT and OS/2. Original author of that
article Bernie
Thompson stirs the pot again and tastes what the operating system world has
been cooking up.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f82a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
20 years ago in the world of operating systems, IBM was a dying king and
Microsoft an ascendant prince. Apple was in exile. And a young wizard named
Linus Torvalds rebuilt venerable UNIX, which already had 20 years of its
own history, and re-imagined it in the form of Linux. The world had a
powerful new open-source platform on which to build.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11622f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Issue #1 of <span  class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
By the end of the 1990s, IBM was nearly irrelevant to the personal computer
market it had built. Microsoft had risen to nearly 90% market share
(<a href="http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/study-shows-windows-owns-desktop-market" target="_self">windowsitpro.com/systems-management/study-shows-windows-owns-desktop-market</a>).
Linux had a disconcerting combination of enormous investor hype and low
market share. But Linux quietly was beginning to appear in set-top boxes
and networking equipment. It was dominating the Internet server market. And
a little company called Google was deploying thousands of Linux boxes to
revolutionize search (<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue59/correa.html" target="_self">linuxgazette.net/issue59/correa.html</a>).
</p><p>
By the end of the 2000s, at least ten &ldquo;year of the Linux
desktop&rdquo; milestones
had come and gone without success. Windows still was dominant, but the PC
era was about to end. Apple had returned from the dead to win the hearts
and wallets of consumers and developers by building OS X and iOS on an
open-source Mach+BSD kernel with different lineage from Linux. Linux was
everywhere and nowhere: the Internet ran on Linux, yet few consumers'
browsers did. 
</p><p>
Here in 2014, the world seems to be shifting in Linux's direction, as long
as a Linux-derived kernel is what counts. Windows 8 has alienated
Microsoft's installed base. Mobile is ascendant. Android has reached 80%
smartphone share (<a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24442013" target="_self">www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24442013</a>). And last year, Chromebooks rose to take 10% of the US
computer market and 21% of laptop sales, outselling Apple MacBooks (<a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/u-s-commercial-channel-computing-device-sales-set-to-end-2013-with-double-digit-growth-according-to-npd" target="_self">https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/u-s-commercial-channel-computing-device-sales-set-to-end-2013-with-double-digit-growth-according-to-npd</a>). Yet
the Linux desktop, in the pure form of Ubuntu or one of the other distros,
still shuffles along with less than 2% share by most measures.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f8930"></a>
From Megabytes to Gigabytes</h2></div></div><p>
In the first issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I wrote &ldquo;Linux needs 2MB RAM to try
out, OS/2 needs 4MB, and NT needs 12MB.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Those Linux and OS/2 numbers were for command-line configurations only. The
NT number included its GUI since it couldn't operate without it. But the
march of Moore's Law over the long stretch is stunning. In less than 20
years, we've seen nearly a 1,000x increase in typical memory sizes. 
</p><p>
Today, Windows 8 can run in 512MB for just a single task or two, but 2GB
is a normal minimum. Linux is still the most miserly. 256MB is normal
for platforms like the Raspberry Pi, and running Linux on a wireless router
with 8MB of RAM is not unheard of using DD-WRT micro version.
</p><p>
The original article focused on the issues of &ldquo;Will Linux, OS/2, or NT work
on my PC?&rdquo; These issues have receded as even sub-$200 PCs today can run
anything. The important question has become &ldquo;What's the best fit for what I
need my computer to do?&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f8cf8"></a>
The Importance of the OS</h2></div></div><p>
A good operating system mediates between users, applications and hardware
with a focus on clarity, compatibility and security. It enables
applications written today to work on the latest OS version, and a
significant portion of the existing installed base of older versions. It
enables those applications to keep working even as things underneath change
over time. It allows hardware created today to support existing
applications and ones not yet written. All it takes is for one essential
application or piece of hardware to be unavailable on a new platform, and
the user can't move. This creates powerful lock-in to a users' current
system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11622f2.large.jpg"><img src="11622f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Simplified OS Layers
</p></div></div><p>
The OS also provides a UI and set of standard ways for users to get things
done. Humans are flexible, but they suffer compatibility problems too.
When a new UI moves things around, there's a human cost in time and
frustration. When there's a shift in the way computers are used&mdash;from
command line, to mouse and keyboard GUI, to touch GUI&mdash;not every use
scenario or user shifts. We all know the command line is still critical for
any IT pro. Operating systems must either pick a paradigm or find a way to
expose similar functionality in each world. 
</p><p>
This isn't easy, which is part of why the OS world has fractured and
diversified in the shift to touch GUIs during the past few years. As
platforms and UIs have been churned, at times it seems we've needed a
Hippocratic Oath for programmers and UI designers: first, do no
harm.
</p><p>
And in the realm of security, protecting users and their data has become
even harder post-NSA. We've entered a Wild West era where we have ceded
moral authority to deter nations, corporations and rogue groups from
exploiting others on-line. It's everyone for themselves, and a trusted
operating system is at the center of that.
</p><p>
How are the operating systems of today doing by these standards?
</p><p>
Windows has had the largest financial investment in it, by far, during the
past 20 years. For the last decade, Microsoft has had thousands of
employees working on Windows at any given moment. Executives are obsessed
to distraction with avoiding the innovator's dilemma. Many investments are
&ldquo;big bets&rdquo; that aim to anticipate customer and partner demand, rather than
smaller steps to respond to it. Often priorities are focused on internal
goals and &ldquo;better together&rdquo; initiatives that attempt to extend lock-in or
push the user base to the latest version. When those initiatives are aligned
with the interests of users and partners, they tend to succeed. But many
have not.
</p><p>
Among the unheralded successes has been the Windows Update mechanism. For
users, it appears that they plug any new or old device into their Windows
PC, and it just works&mdash;no digging for disks for downloads. In fact, it's
a smart cloud-based system that was implemented before the cloud was a
buzzword. When a new device is plugged in, Windows automatically reads the
plug-and-play IDs, checks its servers on the Web, and downloads and
installs the best available driver automatically. More than ten years on,
Linux and Mac OS X have nothing equivalent.
</p><p>
On the downside, the Windows 8 transition has been particularly jarring.
Microsoft faced a tough choice: lose market share in the new tablet space
or create a version of Windows and an ecosystem of applications that
supports tablets well. It chose to sacrifice usability as a desktop
system to win new tablet users. The result is a confusing collision of two
UI worlds. Some users have gone scrambling to find an alternative, driving
up sales of Chromebooks and perhaps hastening the tablet shift.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the Windows 8 App Store had a new API and no provision to run
those apps on Windows 7 or earlier. This created another catch-22 for
winning over application developers. It sped up the unraveling of the
valuable application lock-in that Microsoft had established starting with
Windows 3.1. A commercial application developer a decade ago would have
been crazy not to design for Windows. Today, that same developer is crazy
not to look first at designing for a hosted HTML, CSS and JavaScript model
that would allow the application to work on any platform. That should be
ringing alarm bells in Redmond, given the market share of other Microsoft
platforms that weren't able to leverage the lock-in of Windows binaries
(Windows CE, Zune, Windows Phone and so on).
</p><p>
Security-wise, it's important to understand that Windows 7 and 8 have
perhaps the best line-of-code level security of any existing OS. Microsoft
invests enormous efforts to identify and fix potential exploits before
shipment. But the weekly &ldquo;patch Tuesday&rdquo; flood highlights how difficult it
is to protect a big, juicy target like Windows. It's the potato blight of
our era. We'll talk about Linux security later, but what protects Linux is
less the quality of its code, and more the diversity of it.
</p><p>
After one and a half years, Windows 8 has crossed only 10% market
share (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/windows-8-x-breaks-10-percent-internet-explorer-11-makes-a-splash" target="_self">arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/01/windows-8-x-breaks-10-percent-internet-explorer-11-makes-a-splash</a>). But Microsoft still has a chance to regain its footing, given the
combined market shares of XP, 7 and 8.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f94e0"></a>
Mac OS and iOS</h2></div></div><p>
Steve Jobs warned Microsoft that trying to merge the desktop and tablet
worlds wouldn't work. And so far Apple has largely stuck to that line, with
success. Millions of eager buyers are willing to pay a premium for Apple
products. iOS has been passed by Android in pure unit sales, but still gets
more use day to day.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11622f3.large.jpg"><img src="11622f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Mac OS X was my main platform for much of the 2000s. It puts a nice UI on a
deeply functional UNIX foundation. The excellent MacPorts system gives
entry to the full catalog of open-source applications. Apple's XQuartz
project enables even GUI X apps to be ported. Users that care about
particular scenarios like working with photos, music and video have a
platform with great support for those scenarios, because of Job's attention
to end-to-end quality.
</p><p>
Apple has delivered many innovations, but among the most powerful was the
successful iOS and later OS X App Stores. Small developers had withered
under Microsoft. By enabling software developers to make money, these app
stores quickly allowed Apple's application ecosystem to rival Microsoft's.
</p><p>
Apple has historically been more willing to sacrifice the compatibility of
older applications and hardware. That might have become a problem as
Apple's installed base grew. But the application problem has been mitigated
with the strategy of offering free OS upgrades combined with free
application upgrades from the App Store. Your current software binaries
won't work several versions from now, but you won't care because you'll
have downloaded a free update. 
</p><p>
Hardware compatibility, however, often has been sacrificed. One gets the
sense that Apple sees a robust hardware ecosystem as competing with it,
rather than a source of strength for the platform as a whole.
</p><p>
In security, Apple has been both smart and lucky. Smart to build on UNIX.
Smart to introduce strict app store criteria and the Gatekeeper feature to
steer users away from untrusted apps. But it also has been lucky to
stay under the radar. If Windows and OS X's market shares were reversed,
Apple would be forced to have a much higher level of focus on individual
exploits, being a monoculture like Windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x26f9a08"></a>
Android and Chrome OS</h2></div></div><p>
Google also has kept the tablet and desktop worlds apart somewhat, in the
form of Android for tablets and Chrome OS for laptops, both built on the
Linux kernel.
</p><p>
Linus' strategy of benevolent dictatorship for the Linux kernel has
delivered stable progress through the years and kept the worst decisions out.
However, above the kernel, progress on Linux has been unstable and
constantly disruptive...mostly to users, if not to competitors. 
</p><p>
With Android, Google's role has been to provide that stability above the
kernel, along with the opportunity for a for-profit ecosystem of software
and hardware to build around the platform. The result has been an amazing
explosion of Linux-based devices.
</p><p>
With Chrome OS, Google has consummated the process of making the browser
the OS. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the new terminal to the cloud. For
those of us who live on the Web and hosted applications, there is enormous
peace of mind in having no local software and few security issues to think
about&mdash;especially when we're gifting a laptop to grandpa or our
daughter,
or if we think we're on the NSA's naughty list.
</p><p>
Because Android and Chrome OS are open source, whether you're Amazon
building the Kindle or CyanogenMod, you have the freedom to take it in new
directions.
</p><p>
Google has succeeded in hastening the end of the Windows monopoly by
grabbing a significant chunk of market share with an open-source operating
system based on Linux. All this makes it likely that the next generation of
applications will be developed with Web compatibility and platform
portability as a primary concern. Even if Android and Chrome OS do not
continue their meteoric rise, for the moment they have mitigated much of
the lock-in that would have prevented users from moving to the next
innovative platform.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x2af1f70"></a>
The Linux Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
The ever-churning cauldron of Linux distros and spins is the hotbed of
innovation from which Android, Chrome OS, Kindle, TiVO and countless other
innovations past and future are born. On the downside, competing groups
innovating in different directions have obvious consequences for some key OS
characteristics: clarity and compatibility.
</p><p>
In practice, for hardware that is well documented, the results at the
kernel level are generally excellent. If you can get your driver into the
kernel, it tends to get carried forward intact. On the other hand, trying
to keep a binary driver in sync with the Linux kernel is difficult,
expensive and usually futile. Linux's strategy of sacrificing binary
compatibility for the freedom to innovate and keep the kernel clean has
proven powerful over time.
</p><p>
There are some exceptions, such as graphics, which touches many layers of
the stack. The transition to compositing desktops has hurt performance on
Linux scenarios where a beefy GPU isn't available. And the more
functionally complex KMS/DRM driver model has had many impacts on users. OS
features like support for multiple monitors that require participation at
many layers have been difficult to achieve.
</p><p>
At the application level, the story is more mixed than the kernel.
Competing libraries, versions and package managers make it difficult to
port even open-source applications to every distribution. There are many
potential libraries to become dependent on, and each dependency may evolve
in ways that will demand that your application change or bifurcate to keep
up.
</p><p>
Some distros focus on minimizing churn and compromising by providing
facilities, such as a commercial app store. Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise
Linux are best known as playing this role on the desktop. When that plot
has been lost, back-to-basics distros like Linux Mint have won converts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x2af21d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Amazon m1.small EC2 Pricing Linux vs. Windows</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Linux: $0.060/hour
</p></li><li><p>
Windows: $0.091/hour
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
In the cloud, Amazon has a growing list of applications in its
marketplace built on Linux (often Red Hat- or Debian-based). You can see
Linux's customizability, maintainability and lack of licensing cost at
work in how Amazon prices Linux-based hosting vs. Windows hosting. Linux is
a more cost-effective choice.
</p><p>
Can the Linux distributions do a better job for end users? Yes,
definitely. Branches like Ubuntu's effort to replace X with Mir should not
be taken so lightly. It would be a boon to Linux adoption if there were
more efforts to consolidate or combine projects, to present a unified front
to applications and end users. Is the universe forever expanding until
we're all on isolated islands, or will it consolidate? It's a delicate
balance. We could start with a joint development conference between the
Canonical and Red Hat teams to find common ground.
</p><p>
On the plus side, Linux's software and hardware diversity make it difficult
for mass exploits. And more fundamentally, open source is essential for
trust through transparency. Any individual, nation or corporation can do
its own code review to weed out potential exploits. While not a panacea
for sophisticated, targeted attacks, these characteristics allow Linux to
deliver the best security of any platform in practice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2600580.0x2af26a8"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
Despite the challenges, the future for Linux is unstoppably bright.
</p><p>
Beyond the desktop, Linux leads in servers and has completely conquered the
embedded market. It's impossible to conceive of any one company being able
to port a commercial OS to as many CPU and device architectures as Linux
has. As the embedded world transitions from 8/16-bit processors to 32-bit,
billions of new devices will be running Linux inside. 
</p><p>
Even today, average Microsoft or Apple executives are probably (knowingly
or unknowingly) running several copies of Linux in their homes: perhaps
their TV, router, thermostat or the coming generation of appliances and
vehicles.
</p><p>
Linux is currently winning the mobile race with Android and grabbing
significant &ldquo;desktop&rdquo; share with Chrome OS. Efforts such as CyanogenMod,
Firefox OS and Ubuntu for phones will keep creating innovative options.
And as applications and users increasingly live within the browser, the
barriers to move between platforms will continue to fall.
</p><p>
The revolution that Linus started 20 years ago is accelerating. &ldquo;World
domination&rdquo;, which was previously a sly joke, now appears inevitable. Happy
birthday, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
