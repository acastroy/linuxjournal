Irssi has everything but a GUI, until today.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've tried pretty much every IRC client available for both Linux and
OS X. (I use both platforms during my day job.) No matter how many times I
try to find a GUI application that meets my needs, I always turn back to
Irssi. It works so well, and I can access it from anywhere (Figure 1).
Thanks to my Raspberry Pi colocation in Austria, I always can stay logged
in and never miss a message. Unfortunately, the one thing I wish Irssi
had is a pop-up notification when someone sends me a message or mentions
me in a channel. So, I decided to give Irssi a little GUI. It was fun,
and as it turns out, it works very well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11643f1.large.jpg"><img src="11643f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. I actually had to scroll up a bit to find something harmless 
enough to post in the magazine!
</p></div></div><p>
If you're running Irssi locally on the Linux machine you're sitting in
front of, this process is much simpler. Since my Irssi-connected machine
is on another continent, the process is a little more complex, but
also a lot more fun. In order to get local GUI notifications for remote
mentions of my user name, I need to accomplish a few things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
I have to get Irssi to generate some sort of event and/or log when
I'm mentioned in an IRC channel or query.
</p></li><li><p>
I have to parse that information and transfer it to my local machine
over the Internet in real time.
</p></li><li><p>
I need to display a GUI pop-up on my local machine when the remote
events occur, again in real time.
</p></li><li><p>
I need to be able to disconnect and reconnect to a screen session
and have the GUI notifications follow me, regardless of what computer
I'm actually on. (In my case, this means Linux or OS X.)
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Thankfully, Linux supplies all the tools I need, and with a little bit
of scripting, I can get the system working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978a90"></a>
Step 1: Irssi Events</h2></div></div><p>
I'm obviously not the first person to want a GUI notification
system for Irssi, and thankfully, Thorsten Leemhuis has shared his
Irssi plugin for everyone to use. You can download the plugin at
<a href="http://www.leemhuis.info/files/fnotify/fnotify" target="_self">www.leemhuis.info/files/fnotify/fnotify</a>, and since it's released
under the GPL, you can share it as you see fit.
</p><p>
In order to use the script, save it as fnotify.pl in your
~/.irssi/scripts/ folder where Irssi is running. For me, that's on my
remote server in Austria. Once saved, you can load the script by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/script load fnotify.pl
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978ca0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
from inside the Irssi application. If you want to make fnotify.pl be
loaded automatically every time Irssi starts (my recommendation), create
a symbolic link into the autorun folder inside the scripts folder. To
do that, type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun (if it doesn't exist already)
ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/fnotify.pl 
 &#8618;~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/fnotify.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
Then fnotify should be loaded every time Irssi starts. To make sure
it's working correctly, have someone mention you in an IRC channel,
and check to see that the message is written to the file ~/.irssi/fnotify.
</p><p>
Once you're certain the plugin is working, and mentions of your name
are written to the fnotify file, it's time to get that information to
your local computer. But first, you need to set up the local computer for GUI
pop-up messages, so you have somewhere to <span   class="emphasis"><em>send</em></span> the
information when you
transfer it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978fb8"></a>
A Local GUI Notification</h2></div></div><p>
This part of the equation is fairly simple. Most Linux distributions come
with a notification system of some sort. I prefer a GNOME environment,
so I choose to use libnotify, or more specifically the
<tt  >notify-send</tt>
command that creates a GUI pop-up when invoked from the command line
or from a script. KDE users can use the <tt  >kdialog</tt> program for a similar
effect, and OS X users will want to check out Terminal Notifier, hosted
at <a href="https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier" target="_self">https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier</a>.
</p><p>
From your Linux command line, test <tt  >notify-send</tt> by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
notify-send "Test Title" "Sample message..."
</pre>
</p><p>
That should bring up a libnotify box with your title and message
(Figure 2). If you're using KDE (or OS X), the command will be similar,
but you'll need to check for the exact syntax. It's also possible to
tweak the program to get custom icons, change the duration of the pop-up
and even change the system urgency for the notification. I actually use
a Pidgin icon for the notification box, only because I've used Pidgin
for so long, the icon makes me think &ldquo;chat&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11643f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The pop-up system is really pretty slick.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1979538"></a>
Remote fnotify, Local libnotify</h2></div></div><p>
This is the part of the equation that stumped me for a long time. I'd
done remote X tunneling over SSH, but since Irssi didn't have a native
GUI pop-up, there was no X stuff to tunnel. I also knew that if I SSH'd
to my remote server, any commands I ran would execute on the remote
server. Thankfully, with enough googling and head-scratching, I learned
something: it's possible to run a remote program <span   class="emphasis"><em>other than a
shell</em></span>
over SSH! I had never considered that as a possibility, but it certainly
makes sense.
</p><p>
Knowing that I could run a program over SSH on a remote server and
have its output appear on my local machine, it turned into a simple
scripting matter to get the fnotify text piped in to libnotify. I should
point out that it's much easier to do remote SSH stuff if you have a
keypair set up to avoid the need to type in a password. It's possible
to run the commands interactively, but you lose a lot of the automation
aspect. I have a simple tutorial video for setting up SSH keypairs here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R65HTJeObkI" target="_self">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R65HTJeObkI</a>.
</p><p>
Here is my script; I'll explain it afterward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# Location: /usr/local/bin/irc_notify
(ssh spowers@my.remote.server.com \
-o PermitLocalCommand=no -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \
"&gt; .irssi/fnotify; tail -f .irssi/fnotify" |
while read title message; do
notify-send -u critical -i pidgin "${title}" "${message}";
done)
</pre>
</p><p>
I must confess again that the code above has been scrounged from other
people's work and tweaked by me a bit. I certainly don't claim to be
the owner of the concept. The script assumes keypairs are installed,
but it probably will work interactively if there are no keypairs set up.
</p><p>Here's what the script does:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The script launches SSH with a couple options. I added the
<tt  >ServerAliveInterval=30</tt> option because in my case, my SSH connection would
time out after a while. That took away the whole point of the script,
so that option is to keep the connection alive.
</p></li><li><p>
Instead of running a shell, which is the default, I specified what
program SSH is supposed to run on the remote machine. I actually have it
do two things: first, clear the fnotify file in .irssi, and second, run
<tt  >tail -f</tt> on the same file. I clear the file so it doesn't get too long,
but if you want to keep a record of all of your messages, you can leave
that first part off&mdash;it won't affect how the script works.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >tail -f</tt> is a command that stays running and prints any new entries
to the specified file to the command line. It's normally used for watching
log files, but in this case, it's perfect. Every time someone mentions
my user name, <tt  >tail -f</tt> prints it to the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
Notice at the end of that line is the pipe symbol (|)&mdash;that sends
the output to the program following it, instead of printing it to the
screen. In this case, it &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; the output of <tt  >tail
-f</tt> into a while
loop that reads the text into two different variables. The command
<tt  >read title message</tt> assigns the first word in the output (usually the
name of the person messaging me) to the variable
<tt  >$title</tt> and the rest
of the message to the variable <tt  >$message</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
The while loop then runs <tt  >notify-send</tt> with the variables from above,
and starts the loop over, waiting for another output from the remote
SSH'd tail command. To end the program, you can press ^C. (But I actually
automate that too; more on that a bit later.)
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The script itself is simple, but it can be confusing to figure out
what portions are occurring remotely and what portions are occurring
locally. Once I learned that the SSH program can run a program other
than the shell on a remote system, the scripting concept started to
make sense. Hopefully, it does to you too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1d722e0"></a>
Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>
You now have a system that will notify you when someone mentions your name
in a running session of Irssi. I'll assume you run Irssi in a screen or
tmux session, so you can connect and disconnect as need be. Because
I connect from various machines, that's how I do it. To make things
simple, however, I've written a second script that establishes the
notification SSH connection and then SSHes me into the server. Then,
when I disconnect from the interactive SSH session, it kills off the
notification connection too. I call the script from above irc_notify,
and the script below simply irc. When I want to use IRC, I type
<tt  >irc</tt>
from the command line, and the notification stuff happens automatically.
Here's that "irc" script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# Location: /usr/local/bin/irc
#
# Kill any existing fnotify sessions that might be 
# running to avoid duplicate notifications
kill $(ps aux | grep [f]notify | awk '{print $2}') &gt; 
 &#8618;/dev/null &amp;2&gt;1
irc_notify &amp;
ssh spowers@my.remote.server.com
# Kill all current fnotify sessions, so notifications 
# don't pop up while I'm not connected to IRC
kill $(ps aux | grep [f]notify | awk '{print $2}')
</pre>
</p><p>
The script isn't really anything complex, but the kill lines are a little
tricky. I run <tt  >ps aux</tt> and then grep for
&ldquo;fnotify&rdquo; to make sure I have the
correct SSH session. Unfortunately, when you grep for a particular word,
you also get the actual grep process. Using the
<tt  >[f]notify</tt> regex, only the
SSH process is returned. Then, the second field is the process ID (PID),
so I use awk to get just that information and kill the process by number.
</p><p>
I have that command twice: once before launching the interactive SSH
session to make sure the notification script isn't already running,
and then once after I disconnect to clean up after myself. Ideally,
the first kill statement never will find anything to kill off, since my
script cleans up after itself, but sometimes things go wrong. I like to
make sure I don't get duplicate notifications due to multiple fnotify
scripts running.

Cross Platform, and Beyond!</h2></div></div><p>
I regularly use the scripts on both Linux and OS X. I have no idea if
there is something that would do graphical pop-ups on Windows, but I
think the scripting part would work using Cygwin. I haven't had a need
to test such a thing on Windows, but I'd be interested in hearing about
it if you get it working.
</p><p>
I love using Irssi for chatting via IRC, and now that I have a GUI
notification system for it, I'll probably start using Bitlbee for other
IM protocols, making Irssi truly my one-stop shop for chatting needs. I
hope this scripting lesson inspires you to do far more than I've
accomplished&mdash;with Linux, the only limiting factor is your imagination!
