We need to protect the freedoms in which Linux was born and grew up.

I've been with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> since it was a gleam in Phil Hughes' eye, back
in 1993. Phil's original plan was for something he called &ldquo;a free software
magazine&rdquo;. I was one of the friends Phil recruited to think and talk,
mostly by by e-mail, about how to make the magazine happen. The project was
pretty far downstream when Phil sent the whole thing sideways with five
words: &ldquo;There's this kid from Finland....&rdquo; That was the first I'd heard of
Linus, or of Linux. But Phil was one of the world's experts on UNIX (having
fathered many UNIX publications in previous years), and he was convinced that Linux
was exactly the free operating system the world was waiting for. He was
right.
</p><p>
And so <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was born, in March 1994, just as Linux itself arrived
at version 1.0. Its first Editor in Chief was Bob Young, who knew almost
nothing about Linux when Phil recruited him. (&ldquo;He was selling circuit
boards or something from a booth in the back of a tradeshow&rdquo;, Phil said.)
Not long after that, Bob left to start a Linux company of his own, called
Red Hat.
</p><p>
The first piece I wrote for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was an interview with Craig
Burton for an insert called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Websmith</em></span>. Craig sought me out, because he
wanted to alert the Linux folks to LDAP, which he said was throwing a
monkey wrench into Microsoft's plans to do for networked directories what
it had done for desktop operating systems. Craig was right, and the wrench
worked.
</p><p>
I started writing full time for <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> in 1998, covering the open-sourcing of
Netscape's browser (now known as Firefox) and the creation of its new
parent, Mozilla.org. This coincided with the birth of the open-source
movement and the dot-com explosion, for which Linux itself was ground zero.
The biggest IPOs of 1999 (a record IPO year) were Red Hat, Andover (which
had earlier acquired Slashdot) and VA Linux (which later acquired Andover).
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> also had offers at the time to sell out, but Phil turned them
down. If he had said yes, some of us (especially Phil) would have scored
big, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> would have been long gone by now.
</p><p>
Back then, most of the staff worked in our Seattle headquarters. I worked
remotely from California or wherever else I happened to be, and would fly
in every couple months for meetings and work, and enjoyed it totally. We
hit all the Linux tradeshows, plus O'Reilly's OSCon and Emerging Tech
conferences. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> was hot stuff, and so were our advertisers, most of which
were venture-funded dot-com players. Then, when the crash hit in 2000, most
of those advertisers vanished, leaving nobody to bill, sue or get on the
phone. And then, after the attacks on 9/11/2001, companies everywhere
dropped all kinds of discretionary expenses, including travel and
advertising, and that hit us hard too. (I got an extra whammy by losing
every one of the speaking gigs that were lined up at the time.)
</p><p>
Then, over the next few years, the Web became a &ldquo;content delivery
platform&rdquo;
for literally millions of blogs, sites that were &ldquo;publishers&rdquo; in name only,
and &ldquo;social networks&rdquo;, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr and the
rest. So, while <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> eagerly covered open-source CMSes (content
management systems) like Drupal and WordPress, it also had to compete in a
world filled with abundant low-grade &ldquo;content&rdquo; or worse: editorial matter
scraped and republished, often without attribution, from legitimate sources
(including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>), just to game Google and other advertising
systems. That <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is still alive, and thriving, is testimony to
amazing leadership and fortitude by Carlie Fairchild (our Publisher), Jill
Franklin (our Executive Editor) and everybody else on our masthead
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/staff" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/staff</a>).
</p><p>
But that's just us. There are bigger battles going on that I want to take
this anniversary opportunity to talk about. One is over the future of
journalism. The other is over the future of the Internet as an environment
for developing and deploying Linux and other open platforms like it. Both
are battles over the same organizing principle.
</p><p>
First, journalism.
</p><p>
For the past year and a half, I've been a visiting scholar at the Arthur L.
Carter Journalism Institute at NYU (<a href="http://journalism.nyu.edu" target="_self">journalism.nyu.edu</a>). My main work there has been helping
professor Jay Rosen (who stars on Twitter as @JayRosen_NYU) with Studio 20
(<a href="http://studio20nyu.tumblr.com" target="_self">studio20nyu.tumblr.com</a>),
which is defined as &ldquo;a consultancy that gets paid in problems&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/11416036656/in/set-72157638756349696" target="_self">www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/11416036656/in/set-72157638756349696</a>). In academic
terms, the class is clinical: students work on real-world problems with
real-world publishers. During my time there, Studio 20 students have
consulted
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Fast Company</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Publica</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quartz</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pando
Daily</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Syria Deeply</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>ABC
News</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>TimeOut New York</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Atavist</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Al Jazeera
America</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>DFM Thunderdome</em></span> and others
(<a href="http://studio20nyu.tumblr.com/post/50351221259/studio-20s-networked-reporting-project" target="_self">studio20nyu.tumblr.com/post/50351221259/studio-20s-networked-reporting-project</a>). Here are a few of the learnings I've
gathered over the course of that time, both from the class and from
experience with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and other media:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The future of journalism is what Jay Rosen calls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>networked</em></span>
(<a href="http://pressthink.org/2013/05/designs-for-a-networked-beat" target="_self">pressthink.org/2013/05/designs-for-a-networked-beat</a>), Andrew Leonard
calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>open-source</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.salon.com/1999/10/08/geek_journalism" target="_self">www.salon.com/1999/10/08/geek_journalism</a>), and Dan Gillmor calls
<span   class="emphasis"><em>We the Media</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.authorama.com/we-the-media-1.html" target="_self">www.authorama.com/we-the-media-1.html</a>). Everybody with a
stake in the output contributes input. While this comprises a kind of
model, it is far from being a complete system. The media between individual
contributors&mdash;telephony, texting, e-mail, blogging and postings on
&ldquo;social&rdquo; and other media&mdash;are all fluxy and provisional. You use
whatever works today, which might not be what worked yesterday or will work
tomorrow. The old system was as solid and vertical as an office
building&mdash;and mostly happened inside of buildings filled with paid staff
working on finished pieces for publishing or airing at specific dates and
times. The new system is all scaffolding, all the way down, with very few
people getting paid for the work they do.
</p></li><li><p>
Most professional journalists who had work when the Web was born are out of
the business, or under-employed within it. Many work for little or no
money. Crazy as it may seem, they keep working because they believe the
world needs what they do. (Rollo May once wrote that writers differ from
other artists in this one significant respect: they suffer the illusion
that the world really needs to hear what they have to say.) In this
respect,
journalists are a lot like Linux kernel hackers.
</p></li><li><p>
The portfolio of helpful skills for journalism today goes far beyond
writing, photography, video and the ability to dig into a subject. I was
amazed to hear new graduate students in journalism, when asked what skills
they bring to the table, say stuff like &ldquo;Ruby, Python and
PHP&rdquo;. When we
went around the room introducing ourselves on the first day of Studio 20, I
heard only one student say &ldquo;writing&rdquo; and one say
&ldquo;investigative reporting&rdquo;.
The rest all talked about their skills with software tools and services.
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Direct response&rdquo; advertising is all the rage in digital media
(<a href="http://wfoa.wharton.upenn.edu/perspective/docsearls" target="_self">wfoa.wharton.upenn.edu/perspective/docsearls</a>). This stuff
might be called advertising, but it is instead directly descended from
direct mail, better known as junk mail. It works on the assumption that
surveillance-fed &ldquo;big data&rdquo; mills can give individuals an ideally
personalized &ldquo;advertising experience&rdquo;. For whatever good it
does (such as keeping publishers alive), it is also why the most popular browser
extensions and add-ons are ones that block ads and tracking. It also models
spying for the NSA. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Intention Economy</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Intention-Economy-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527" target="_self">www.amazon.com/The-Intention-Economy-Customers-Charge/dp/1422158527</a>), I call it a bubble, and I
stand by that claim. If you want to know more about why it is doomed, read
Don Marti (<a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti" target="_self">zgp.org/~dmarti</a>), our former Editor in Chief, who is doing the world's deepest and
most prophetic thinking and writing on the topic
(<a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti/business/#.UtwhOKWtv0E" target="_self">zgp.org/~dmarti/business/#.UtwhOKWtv0E</a>). 
</p></li><li><p>
The subscription model is stronger than ever. Interesting fact: when
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> went all-digital (dropping print), we lost a few subscribers but
gained many more. This was, and remains, a Good Thing. But it's also one
aspect of another thing....
</p></li><li><p>
We no longer own our stuff. We just have limited rights to use it. This is
true of music, movies, books and countless apps on mobile phones and
tablets. In a <span   class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> sense, it's even true of much of the hardware we
depend on, every day. Look at what it actually says in the terms and
conditions (<a href="http://www.tacma.com" target="_self">www.tacma.com</a>) you accept when you buy your smartphone or tablet, and the
software that runs on it&mdash;even the stuff that costs nothing. Also look
at who is snarfing up your usage data and what's being done with it. (If
you can tell at all. Most of it is behind walls you can't penetrate.) Then
consider this fact: there are few generic white-box phones or tablets. The
existence of those in the computer market made both Linux and the Internet
possible.
</p></li><li><p>
The commercial world has turned into a forest of silos. Every &ldquo;loyalty
program&rdquo;, every subscription system (ours included), and every Web site and
service that requires its own login and password is a silo. Every one of
these silos exists for the convenience of those who maintain it, and every
one compounds the inconveniences suffered by the individuals who need to
maintain countless separate &ldquo;relationships&rdquo; contained inside all these
silos. Implicit in this &ldquo;system&rdquo; is the assumption that a captive customer
or user is more valuable than a free one.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Next, the Internet.
</p><p>
I've probably written more about the Internet in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> than about
any other topic. Two of my longest and most cited pieces were both titled
&ldquo;Saving the Net&rdquo;. The first was in June 2003
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6989" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6989</a>), and the second was in
November 2005 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8673" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8673</a>). Here's an excerpt from the first:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Net's problem, from telco and cable industries' perspective, is it was
born without a business model. Its standards and protocols imagine no
coercive regime to require payment&mdash;no metering, no service levels, no
charges for levels of bandwidth. Worse, it was designed as an end-to-end
system, where all the power to create, distribute and consume are located
at the ends of the system and not in the middle. In the words of David
Isenberg (<a href="http://www.isen.com" target="_self">www.isen.com</a>), the Internet's innards
purposefully were kept &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;. All the
intelligence properly belonged at the ends. As a pure end-to-end system,
the Net also was made to be symmetrical. It wasn't supposed to be like TV,
with fat content flowing in only one direction.
</p><p>
The Net's end-to-end nature is so severely anathema to cable and telco
companies that they have done everything they can to make the Net as
controlled and asymmetrical as possible. They want the Net to be more like
television, and to a significant degree, they've succeeded. Most DSL and
cable broadband customers take it for granted that downstream speeds are
faster than upstream speeds, that they can't operate servers out of their
houses and that the only e-mail addresses they can use are ones that end
with the name of their telephone or cable company.
</p><p>
And why not? These companies &ldquo;own&rdquo; the Net, don't they? Well, no, they
don't. They only &ldquo;provide&rdquo; it&mdash;critical difference.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Eleven years later, those companies are now solving that problem by
shifting billing for Internet services from a single monthly subscription
rate to billing for data traffic (the telco model) and for content (the
cable TV model). They're implementing both gradually moving television to
the Net&mdash;and turning the Net into mostly-TV in the process. Their
thinking goes like this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The Net and TV are both just screens. In &ldquo;Report: 90% Of Waking Hours
Spent
Staring At Glowing Rectangles&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/report-90-of-waking-hours-spent-staring-at-glowing,2747" target="_self">www.theonion.com/articles/report-90-of-waking-hours-spent-staring-at-glowing,2747</a>),
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Onion</em></span> writes, &ldquo;staring blankly at
luminescent rectangles is an increasingly central part of modern life. At
work, special information rectangles help men and women silently complete
any number of business-related tasks, while entertainment
rectangles&mdash;larger and louder and often placed inside the home&mdash;allow
Americans to enter a relaxing trance-like state after a long day of
rectangle-gazing.&rdquo; So the distinction between watching TV and using the Net
hardly matters.
</p></li><li><p>
If you have a cable or satellite subscription, you can already watch many
networks&mdash;or all of them (we use Dish Anywhere)&mdash;on your laptop
or hand-held. Likewise, you can watch lots of stations and networks, also
with subscriptions, delivered via IP, the Internet Protocol.
</p></li><li><p>
Captive lawmakers have kindly allowed their overlords in the content and
transport industries to verticalize entertainment supply chains, making it
easy to shift TV from cable and satellite to the Net, while keeping the
existing billing systems intact and opening opportunities for many more.
Susan Crawford unpacked this nicely in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Captive Audience: The
Telecom
Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age</em></span>
(<a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300153132" target="_self">yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300153132</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Bandwidth is naturally scarce, and it costs a lot to build out
infrastructure, especially for mobile devices that can suck down 4K video
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution</a>)
over cellular connections. Why not price the offerings accordingly?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
And that's how Hollywood will finish body-snatching the Internet.
</p><p>
So, what does this mean for Linux? Won't we still be able to write code,
submit patches, participate in lists and so on?
</p><p>
Sure, but what else? What options will be foreclosed in a system that's run
by Hollywood and its allies at Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft&mdash;and the only software available for most people will be on the shelves
of company stores?
</p><p>
In a word, <span   class="emphasis"><em>freedom</em></span>. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>'s bones is a belief that free
software, free hardware and free people are more valuable&mdash;to
themselves and to the world&mdash;than captive ones. We believe in openness
too, but freedom is the deeper, more essential and more personal virtue.
Freedom is embodied in the GPL v2 license
(<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0" target="_self">opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0</a>) that Linus chose for Linux at the
start, and which I am sure is one reason Linux succeeded to degrees other
OSes can only envy. Freedom is also in the hearts of Linux kernel hackers,
and many Linux developers and users.
</p><p>
But that population is a shrinking minority among professionals working
with Linux, simply because Linux is a huge success, and has enlarged the
general talent pool. That's why you see billboards yelling &ldquo;<span   class="bold"><b>Do You Know
Linux? WE ARE HIRING!</b></span>&rdquo; From the perspective of Linux 1.0, this is a dream
come true. Yet knowing Linux isn't the same as sharing the values that made
Linux kick butt. For some perspective on what's happening here, let's
revisit &ldquo;A Tale of Three Cultures&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5912" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5912</a>), which I wrote for the March 2002 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. In it, I described what I saw as three different overlapping
constituencies, each with their own cultures (Figure 1). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11640f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Three Cultures
</p></div></div><p>
Lawrence Lessig drew the Geeks/Hollywood distinction in the June 16, 2002
<span   class="emphasis"><em>eWeek</em></span>, where he wrote, &ldquo;There's a civil war brewing in my state of
California.
It is again a war between the Silicon Valley-based IT industry
in the North and Hollywood content and entertainment producers in the
South. Silicon Valley has become the target of punitive legislation being
pushed by Hollywood in Congress&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/Hollywood-v-Silicon-Valley-Make-New-Code-Not-War" target="_self">www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/Hollywood-v-Silicon-Valley-Make-New-Code-Not-War</a>).
In August of that year, he said this to
the geeks assembled at an O'Reilly conference
(<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2002/08/15/lessig.html" target="_self">www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2002/08/15/lessig.html</a>):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Creativity and innovation always builds on the past.</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The past always tries to control the creativity that builds upon
it.</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Free societies enable the future by limiting this power of the
past.</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ours is less and less a free society.</em></span>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The title of Larry's talk was &ldquo;Free Culture&rdquo;, same as the book
(<a href="http://www.free-culture.cc" target="_self">www.free-culture.cc</a>) he was
writing at the time. He was fighting against the expansion of copyright law
at the time. We (and he) lost that fight, because Hollywood controls
Washington. But never mind that. Mind instead the word
<span   class="emphasis"><em>culture</em></span>. That's what
we're talking about. We're kinda Libertarian in our approach to technology,
and we'd rather not screw around with &ldquo;policy&rdquo;, as it's known in academic
circles.
</p><p>
The third culture is Embedded. Here's what I said about it in <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Tale of
Three Cultures</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I was at the Embedded Systems Conference in San Francisco (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020803003421/http://www.esconline.com/sf" target="_self">https://web.archive.org/web/20020803003421/http://www.esconline.com/sf</a>), which seemed a
world away in time. It was a big conference, filling most of both the North
and South Halls at the Moscone Center. Linux was huge here. Domination of
the embedded world looks no less inevitable, in spite of the huge Microsoft
and Wind River booths, which stood out like boulders in the stream of
history.
</p><p>
[Embedded is] purely technical. It's pre-Net, pre-UNIX and maybe even
pre-cultural. It shows up where raw technology meets the real world, and
its concerns are utterly practical. &ldquo;Here's the problem&rdquo;, it
says. &ldquo;Let's
solve it.&rdquo; This is a heads-down culture and civilization depends on it.
Embedded systems are what run our cash registers and brake systems, our
airplane guidance systems, our factory robotics, our flow meters, our
stoplights and our heating systems. The Net and Linux are both handy ways
to solve countless embedded systems problems&mdash;extremely handy, it turns
out. One morning at SXSW I read that embedded Linux will soon run in
something like 60,000 cash registers at Home Depot. It's a big story, but
mostly a technical one. Does Home Depot give a damn about Linux as a cause?
Or about the lawmaking that threatens to turn the Net into nothing more
than a backbone for industrial-grade commerce, plus a bunch of culverts for
moving &ldquo;content&rdquo; stamped and sanitized by ubiquitous digital content
management? I kind of doubt it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Good as it is, and much as we celebrate its success, Android is an embedded
Linux operating system. It is also run by one giant company. The Android
source FAQ (<a href="http://source.android.com/faqs.html" target="_self">source.android.com/faqs.html</a>) makes that quite clear. Android is Google's show. To contrast
that with Linux, dig what Andrew Morton
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Morton_%28computer_programmer%29" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Morton_%28computer_programmer%29</a>)
told me a few years back
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-now-slave-corporate-masters" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/linux-now-slave-corporate-masters</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Look for example at the IBM engineers that do work on the kernel. They
understand (how it works) now. They are no longer IBM engineers that work
on the kernel. They're <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel</em></span> developers that work for IBM. My theory here
is that if IBM management came up to one of the kernel developers and said
&ldquo;Look, we need to do that&rdquo;, the IBM engineer would not say,
&ldquo;Oh, the kernel
team won't accept that.&rdquo; He'd say &ldquo;WE won't accept
that.&rdquo; Because now they
get it. Now they understand the overarching concern we have for the
coherency and longevity of the code base.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
One point here is that kernel developers are autonomous individuals who
work for the kernel, not for any one company&mdash;even if that company
employs them to work on the kernel. The same goes for the people we call
&ldquo;users&rdquo;. The Net, by design, supports autonomy, independence and freedom for
everybody. Protocols such as HTTP, FRP, IRC, NNTP, POP, SMTP and IMAP all
give individuals their own way of connecting with and communicating with
anybody or anything, outside any one company's or government's
controlling systems. Those all embodied principles I call NEA: Nobody owns
it, Everybody can use it, and Anybody can improve it. Linux is that way
too. It's only natural for companies operating in the Net's wide open
commons to try enclosing it. Usually this fails. (Read Greg Kroah-Hartman's
take on what Apple's doing with Thunderbolt,

these big companies never seem to learn.) But I'm not sure about Hollywood.
It won the battle that Larry Lessig outlined 14 years ago. And now
Linux geekery is highly diluted by its embedded uses and the corporate
purposes of embedded development work. The tragedy of the Internet's
commons is one where free and open geek culture is losing to the cultures
of Hollywood and embedded development, and the expediencies of both.

But the cause of freedom got a huge lift from Edward Snowden's revelations
about NSA spying (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden</a>). That was a wake-up call, and the world has not fallen
asleep since then. In fact, the world is now more awake than ever to the
high level of surveillance going on in the digital world, and its threats
to freedom. So, while the sun shines, we can make hay.
</p><p>
A year before the Snowden revelations, Eben Moglen
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen</a>) gave a keynote at
Freedom to Connect (<a href="http://freedom-to-connect.net/2012" target="_self">freedom-to-connect.net/2012</a>) followed by a
conversation onstage with Isaac Wilder (<a href="http://thefnf.org/people-2" target="_self">thefnf.org/people-2</a>) and
myself. After Eben walked from podium to chair, I said what he gave was not
only one of the best speeches I had ever heard, but one of the most
important. I stand by that claim today. You can find audio at

The talk was 47 minutes long and addressed to
the same audience I am writing for here: people with a deep and abiding
interest in free and open software and hardware. Here is my abridged hack
of the transcript:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The greatest technological innovation of the late 20th century is the thing
we now call the World Wide Web. An invention less than 8000 days old. That
invention is already transforming human society more rapidly than anything
since the adoption of writing....
</p><p>
The browser made the Web very easy to read. Though we built Apache, though
we built the browsers, though we built enormous numbers of things on top of
Apache and the browsers, we did not make the Web easy to write. So a little
thug in a hooded sweatshirt made the Web easy to write, and created a man
in the middle attack on human civilization, which is unrolling now to an
enormous music of social harm. But that's the intermediary innovation that
we should be concerned about. We made everything possible including,
regrettably, PHP, and then intermediaries for innovation turned it into the
horror that is Facebook.
</p><p>
If we'd had a little bit more disintermediated innovation, if we had made
running your own Web server very easy, if we had explained to people from
the very beginning how important the logs are&mdash;and why you shouldn't
let other people keep them for you&mdash;we would be in a rather different
state right now.
</p><p>
We created the idea that we could share operating systems and all the rest
of the commoditizable stack on top of them. We did this using the curiosity
of young people. That was the fuel, not venture capital.
</p><p>
What we need to say is that that curiosity of young people could be
harnessed because all of the computing devices in ordinary day-to-day use
were hackable....This is happening now elsewhere in the world as it
happened in the United States in the 1980s. Hundreds of thousands of young
people around the world hacking on laptops. Hacking on servers. Hacking on
general-purpose hardware available to allow them to scratch their
individual itches, technical, social, career and just plain ludic itches.
&ldquo;I wanna do this, it would be neat.&rdquo; Which is the primary source of the
innovation that drove all of the world's great economic expansion in the
last ten years. All of it. Trillions of dollars of electronic commerce....It
should embolden us to point out once again that the way innovation really
happens is that you provide young people with opportunities to create on an
infrastructure that allows them to hack the real world, and share the
results.
</p><p>
The nature of the innovation established by Creative Commons, by the Free
Software Movement, by Free Culture, which is reflected in the Web, in
Wikipedia, in all the Free Software operating systems now running
everything, even the insides of all those locked-down vampiric Apple things
I see around the room. All of that innovation comes from the simple process
of letting the kids play and getting out of the way. Which, you are aware,
we are working as hard as we can to prevent now completely. Increasingly,
all around the world, the actual computing artifacts of daily life for
human individual beings are being made so you can't hack them. The computer
science laboratory in every 12-year-old's pocket is being
locked-down....If you prevent people from hacking on what they own
themselves, you will destroy the engine of innovation from which everybody
is profiting.
</p><p>
We said from the beginning that Free Software is the world's most advanced
technical educational system. It allows anybody anywhere on Earth to get
to the state of art in anything computers can be made to do, by reading
what is fully available and by experimenting with it, and sharing the
consequences freely. True computer science. Experimentation, hypothesis
formation, more experimentation, more knowledge for the human race.
</p><p>
Which brings us back to this question of anonymity, or rather, personal
autonomy. One of the really problematic elements in teaching young people,
at least the young people I teach, about privacy, is that we use the word
privacy to mean several quite distinct things. Privacy means secrecy,
sometimes. That is to say, the content of a message is obscured to all but
its maker and intended recipient. Privacy means anonymity; sometimes that
means messages are not obscured, but the points generating and receiving
those messages are obscured. And there is a third aspect of privacy, which
in my classroom, I call autonomy. It is the opportunity to live a life in
which the decisions that you make are unaffected by others' access to
secret or anonymous communication.
</p><p>
There is a reason that cities have always been engines of economic growth.
It isn't because bankers live there. Bankers live there because cities are
engines of economic growth. The reason cities have been engines of economic
growth since Sumer is that young people move to them to make new ways of
being. Taking advantage of the fact that the city is where you escape the
surveillance of the village, and the social control of the farm.
</p><p>
The network, as it stands now, is an extraordinary platform for enhanced
social control. Very rapidly, and with no apparent remorse, the two largest
governments on earth, that of the United States of America and the People's
Republic of China have adopted essentially identical points of view. A
robust social graph connecting government to everybody and the exhaustive
data mining of society is both governments' fundamental policy with respect
to their different forms of what they both refer to, or think of, as
stability maintenance. It is true of course that they have different
theories of how to maintain stability for whom and why, but the technology
of stability maintenance is becoming essentially identical.
</p><p>
We who understand what is happening need to be very vocal about that. But
it isn't just our civil liberties that are at stake....We need to make
clear that the other part of what that costs us is the very vitality and
vibrancy of invention culture and discourse....And that freedom to tinker,
to invent, to be different, to be non-conformist&mdash;for which people
have always moved to the cities that gave them anonymity, and a chance to
experiment with who they are, and why they can do.
</p><p>
This more than anything else, is what sustains social vitality and economic
growth in the 21st century. Of course we need anonymity for other reasons.
Of course we are pursuing something that might be appropriately described
as protection for the integrity of the human soul....
</p><p>
We need Free Software, we need Free Hardware we can hack on, we need Free
Spectrum we can use to communicate with one another, without let or
hindrance. We need to be able to educate and provide access to educational
material to everyone on Earth without regard to the ability to pay. We need
to provide a pathway to an independent economic and intellectual life, for
every young person. The technology we need, we have.
</p><p>
I have spent some time...trying to make use of cheap, power-efficient
compact server computers, the size of AC chargers for mobile phones, which
with the right software we can use to populate the Net with robots that
respect privacy, instead of the robots that disrespect privacy, which we now
carry in almost every pocket.
</p><p>
We need to retrofit the first law of robotics into this society within the
next few minutes or we're cooked. We can do that. That's civil innovation.
We can help to continue the long lifetime of general-purpose computers
everybody can hack on&mdash;by using them, by needing them, by spreading them
around. We can use our own force as consumers and technologists to
deprecate closed networks and locked-down objects.

Then came Edward Snowden. And then, a few months later, in November and
December of last year, Eben gave four lectures at Columbia Law School
titled &ldquo;Snowden and the Future&rdquo; (<a href="http://snowdenandthefuture.info" target="_self">snowdenandthefuture.info</a>). In them, he revisited some of what he said in
the speech above, and laid out specific assignments I now pass along to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers (<a href="http://snowdenandthefuture.info/PartIV.html" target="_self">snowdenandthefuture.info/PartIV.html</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We need to decentralize the data, you understand. If we keep it all in one
great big pile, if there's one guy who keeps all the e-mail and another guy
who does all the social sharing about getting laid, then there isn't really
any way to be any safer than the weakest link in the fence around that
pile.
</p><p>
But if every single person is keeping her and his own, then the weak links
on the outside of that fence get the attacker exactly one person's stuff.
Which, in a world governed by the rule of law, might be exactly optimal:
one person is the person you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> spy on because you've got probable cause.
</p><p>
E-mail scales beautifully without anybody at the center keeping all of it.
We need to make a mail server for people that costs five bucks and sits on
the kitchen counter where the telephone answering machine used to be, and
that's the end of it. If it breaks, you throw it away.
</p><p>
Decentralized social sharing is harder, but not so hard that we can't do
it. Three years ago I called for it. Wonderful work has been done that
didn't produce stuff everybody is using, but it's still there: it can't go away,
it's free software, it will achieve its full meaning yet.
</p><p>
For the technologically gifted and engaged around the world this is the big
moment, because if we do our work correctly, freedom will survive and our
grandkids will say: so what did you do back then? I made SSL better.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So let's do that. And much more.
