The increasing use of UEFI Secure Boot in Linux-based
distributions delivers heightened security to a wide range platforms and
devices.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e9580.0x14e11f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With the increasing prevalence of open-source implementations and the
expansion of personal computing device usage to include mobile and non-PC
devices as well as traditional desktops and laptops, combating attacks and
security obstacles against malware is a growing priority for a broad
community of vendors, developers and end users. This trend provides a
useful example of how the flexibility and standardization provided by the
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) technology addresses shared
challenges in ways that help bring better products and experiences to
market. 
</p><p>
The UEFI specification defines an industry-leading interface between the
operating system (OS) and the platform firmware, improving the performance,
flexibility and security of computing devices. Designed for scalability,
extensibility and interoperability, UEFI technology streamlines
technological evolution of platform firmware. In 2013, developers of
several open-source Linux-based operating systems, including Ubuntu
12.10, Fedora 18 and OpenSUSE 12.3, began using UEFI specifications
in their distributions. 
</p><p>
Additional features of UEFI include improved security in the pre-boot mode,
faster booting, support of drives larger than 2.2 Terabytes and integration
with modern 64-bit firmware device drivers. UEFI standards are
platform-independent and compatible with a variety of platform
architectures&mdash;meaning, users of several different types of operating
systems, including both Linux and commercial systems, can enjoy the
benefits of UEFI. Equally, because the UEFI specification includes bindings
for multiple CPU architectures, these benefits apply on a variety of
hardware platforms with these operating systems. 
</p><p>
While UEFI Secure Boot may be one of the most talked about features, the
complete set of features in the UEFI specification provide a standardized
interoperable and extensible booting environment for the operating system
and pre-boot applications. The attributes of this environment make it ideal
for increased use in a rapidly widening array of Linux-based distributions.
UEFI specifications are robust and designed to complement or even further
advance Linux distributions. Industry experts expect to see continued
expansion of their use during 2014 and beyond. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e9580.0x14e1510"></a>
UEFI Secure Boot in Linux-Based Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
Malware developers have increased their attempts to attack the pre-boot
environment because operating system and antivirus software vendors have
hardened their code. Malware hidden in the firmware is virtually
untraceable by the operating system, unless a search specifically targets
malware within the firmware. UEFI Secure Boot assists with system firmware,
driver and software validation. UEFI Secure Boot also allows users of
Linux-based distributions to boot alternate operating systems without
disabling UEFI Secure Boot. It provides users with the opportunity to run
the software of their choice in the most secure and efficient manner, while
promoting interoperability and technical innovation.
</p><p>
Secure Boot is an optional feature of the UEFI specification. The choice of
whether to implement the feature and the details of its implementation
(from an end-user standpoint) are business decisions made by equipment
manufacturers. For example, consider the simplest and most usual case in
which a platform uses UEFI-conformant firmware and a UEFI-aware operating
system. When this system powers on (assuming it has UEFI Secure Boot
enabled), the UEFI firmware uses security keys stored in the platform to
validate the bootloader read from the disk. If the bootloader signature
does not match the signature key needed for verification, the system will
not boot. 
</p><p>
In general, the signature check will succeed because the platform owner
will have purchased the system with pre-installed software set up by the
manufacturer to pre-establish trust between the firmware and operating
system. The signature check also will succeed if the owner has installed an
operating system loader that is trusted along with the appropriate keys
that represent that trust if those keys are not already present in the
platform. The case in which the signature check fails is most likely to
arise when untrusted malware has insinuated its way into the machine,
inserting itself into the boot path and tampering with the previously
installed software. In this way, UEFI Secure Boot offers the prospect of a
hardware-verified, malware-free operating system bootstrap process that
helps improve system deployment security. 
</p><p>
Without UEFI Secure Boot, malware developers can more easily take advantage
of several pre-boot attack points, including the system-embedded firmware
itself, as well as the interval between the firmware initiation and the
loading of the operating system. The UEFI specification promotes
extensibility and customization of security-enhanced interfaces, but allows
the implementers to specify how they are used. As an optional feature, it
is up to the platform manufacturer and system owner to decide how to manage
UEFI Secure Boot. Thus, implementations may vary in how they express
policy, and of course, UEFI Secure Boot is no panacea for every type of
malware or security vulnerability. Nevertheless, in a variety of
implementations that have already reached the market, UEFI Secure Boot has
proven to be a practical and useful tool for improving platform integrity
and successfully defending the point of attack for a dangerous class of
pre-operating system malware.
</p><p>
The broadened adoption of UEFI Secure Boot technology, particularly by the
Linux community, is not only a movement toward innovation, but also a
progressive step toward the safeguarding of emerging computer platforms.
The evolution of firmware technology in a variety of sectors continues to
gain momentum, increasing the use of UEFI technology in Linux and
commercial systems. This is a testament to the cross-functionality of UEFI
between devices, software and systems, as well as its ability to deliver
next-generation technologies for nearly any platform. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e9580.0x14e17d0"></a>
Disabling UEFI Secure Boot in Open-Source Implementations</h2></div></div><p>
A variety of models has emerged for the use of UEFI Secure Boot in the Open
Source community. The minimal approach is to use the ability to disable the
feature&mdash;a facility that is present in practically all platforms that
implement UEFI Secure Boot. In so doing, the platform owner makes the
machine compatible with any operating system that the platform supports
regardless of whether that operating system supports UEFI Secure Boot.
The downside of taking this approach is giving up the protection that
having the feature enabled affords the platform, in terms of improved
resistance to pre-operating system malware.
</p><p>
There are a couple key points to understand about the ability to enable
or disable Secure Boot in any platform. The UEFI specification leaves both
the choice of whether to implement Secure Boot&mdash;as well as the choice to
provide an &ldquo;on/off switch&rdquo;&mdash;up to system designers. Practical
considerations usually make appropriate choices obvious, depending on the
intended use of the product. For example, a system designed to function as
a kiosk that has to survive unattended by the owner in a retail store
environment would likely choose to lock down the software payload as much
as practical to avoid unintended changes that would compromise the
kiosk's basic function. If the kiosk runtime booted using UEFI Secure
Boot, it may make sense to provide no means to disable the feature as part
of the strategy for maximizing kiosk availability and uptime. 
</p><p>
General-purpose compute platforms present a different dynamic. In these
cases, there is an expectation in the marketplace that the owner's
choice of one or more operating systems can be installed on the machine,
regardless of what shipped from the factory. For manufacturers of this
class of systems, the choice of whether to allow enabling/disabling of UEFI
Secure Boot takes into consideration that their customers want to choose from
any available operating system, given than some may include no support for
UEFI Secure Boot. This is true for open source as well as commercial
operating system support. A vendor building a machine that supports all the
operating system offerings from Microsoft's catalog, for example, must
support older versions that have no UEFI Secure Boot support, as well as
the newer ones from the Windows 8 generation that do have such support.
Indeed, the need for the enable/disable feature appears in Microsoft's
own platform design guide as a mandatory requirement, ensuring that
conforming systems can run back catalog products as well as the newest
products.
</p><p>
Following the same line of reasoning, most general-purpose platforms are
shipping with not only the enable/disable feature, but also with facilities
for the platform owner to manage the key store. This means owners
can remove pre-installed keys, and in particular, add new ones of their own
choosing. This facility then provides the basis for those who choose to
roll their own operating system loader images, such as self-signing, or to
select an operating system loader signed by the CA of their choice,
regardless of whether or not the appropriate keys shipped from the factory.
</p><p>
In some cases, the creators of Linux distributions have chosen to
participate directly in the UEFI Secure Boot ecosystem. In this case, a
distribution includes an operating system loader signed by a Certificate
Authority (CA). Today, the primary CA is the UEFI CA hosted by Microsoft,
which is separate but parallel to the CA used for Microsoft's own
software product management. At the time of this writing, no other CA has offered to
participate; however, the UEFI Forum would welcome such an offer, as having
a second source of supply for signing events would be ideal.
</p><p>
In other cases, Linux distributions provide users with a general-purpose
shim-bootloader that will chain boot to a standard, more complete Linux
bootloader in a secure manner. This process extends the chain of trust from
UEFI Secure Boot to the Linux system environment, in which it becomes the
province of the operating system-present code to determine what, if
anything, to do with that trust.

Linux-Based Platforms that Leverage UEFI Secure Boot</h2></div></div><p>
The past year has marked the implementation of UEFI specifications in three
popular Linux-based operating systems: Ubuntu 12.10, Fedora 18 and
OpenSUSE. Below are additional details about their use of UEFI standards.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Canonical's Ubuntu 12.10</b></span>
</p><p>
Support for a base-level compatibility between Canonical's Ubuntu and
UEFI firmware began in October 2012, with the releases of 12.10 64-bit and
12.04.2 64-bit. At the time of release, industry experts projected that
most machines would ship with a firmware compliant with version 2.3.1 of
the UEFI standard. Currently, all Ubuntu 64-bit versions now support the
UEFI Secure Boot feature. When deployed in Secure Boot configurations, the
Ubuntu boot process uses a small &ldquo;boot shim&rdquo;, which allows
compatibility with the third-party CA.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Fedora 18</b></span>
</p><p>
The UEFI Secure Boot implementation in Fedora 18 prevents the execution of
unsigned code in kernel mode and can boot on systems with Secure Boot
enabled. Fedora also boots on UEFI systems that do not support or have
disabled Secure Boot. The bootloaders can run in an environment in which
the boot-path validation process takes place without UEFI. In this mode,
there are no restrictions on executing code in kernel mode. In Fedora 18,
UEFI Secure Boot extends the chain of trust from the UEFI environment into
the kernel. The verification process takes place before loading kernel
modules. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
OpenSUSE 12.3</b></span>
</p><p>
The recent establishment of UEFI as the standard firmware on all x86
platforms was a milestone for the Open Source community, specifically for
OpenSUSE. OpenSUSE 12.2 included support for UEFI, and the recent OpenSUSE
12.3 provides experimental support for the Secure Boot extension. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e9580.0x14e1f60"></a>
The Linux Community's Increasing Use of UEFI Technology for Security
Solutions on Next-Generation Platforms</h2></div></div><p>
The increased reliance on firmware innovation across non-traditional market
segments, combined with the expansion of personal computing from traditional
desktops and laptops to an ever-wider range of form factors, is changing
the landscape of computing devices. Although mobile devices have
traditionally had a custom, locked-down environment, their increasing
versatility and the growing popularity of open-source operating systems
brings growing vulnerability to complex security attacks. While UEFI Secure
Boot cannot unilaterally eradicate the insurgence of security attacks on
any device, it helps provide a cross-functional solution for all platforms
using UEFI firmware&mdash;including Linux-based distributions designed for
tablets, smartphones and other non-PC devices. Currently, no one has
claimed or demonstrated an attack that can circumvent UEFI Secure Boot,
where properly implemented and enabled. The expansion of UEFI technologies
into the Linux space addresses the growing demand for security,
particularly across the mobile and non-PC application continuum.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e9580.0x14e20c0"></a>
What's Next for UEFI Technology in Linux-Based Applications?</h2></div></div><p>
As UEFI specifications continue to enable the evolution of firmware
technology in a variety of sectors, their use will continue to gain
momentum. In addition, the popularity and proliferation of Linux-based
distributions will create even greater demand for UEFI technology. The
recent use of UEFI specifications in Linux-based operating systems, such as
Ubuntu 12.10, Fedora 18 and OpenSUSE 12.3, underscores this trend. 
</p><p>
These distribution companies, along with the Linux Foundation and a number
of other thought-leading groups from the Open Source community, are now
members of the UEFI Forum. This is an important step forward for the
ecosystem as a whole, improving innovation and collaboration between the
firmware and operating system communities. For example, as mentioned above,
many systems include facilities to self-manage the key stores in the
platform, but today, limited potential for automating this exists.
Proposals from the Open Source community address this limitation, with the
promise of significant simplification for installing open-source operating
systems in after-market scenarios. By providing a venue where discussion of
such proposals reaches the ears of all the right stakeholders, the UEFI
Forum helps speed up the arrival of such solutions in the market. This is
exactly the kind of innovation and collaboration that the UEFI Forum is
eager to foster.
</p><p>
The increasing deployment of UEFI technology in both Linux and commercial
systems is a testament to its ability to deliver next-generation
technologies for nearly any platform. A growing number of Linux
distributions use UEFI specifications, allowing users to launch virtually
any operating system of their choosing, while still enjoying the added
security benefits of UEFI Secure Boot. With the expansion of UEFI
specifications across numerous platforms, its intended purpose&mdash;to
streamline and aid in firmware innovation by promoting interoperability
between software, devices and systems&mdash;is realized.
