Versal</h2></div></div><p>
On-line learning is often one-dimensional, limited to videos and slide
decks, says Versal, an interactive on-line course creation and publishing
company. To prove that point, Versal has released version 1.5 of the
firm's identically dubbed application (yes, Versal), a free and open
publishing platform for anyone to create interactive on-line courses&mdash;no
coding required. Versal's argument is that the combination of computers,
together with the modern Internet, are designed for interactivity. The
Versal team believes that by partnering with education enthusiasts and
developers, together it can solve the biggest problems facing humanity.
Versal 1.5 features collaborative authoring, meaning that for the first
time, multiple authors can collaborate and communicate with each other in
real time to develop transformative on-line courses. The result? Versal says
this: &ldquo;Imagine dozens of physics professors and researchers from around
the world working together to author the ultimate guide to the fundamental
structure of the universe. Or a network of global non-profit advocates
creating a water filtration course to help individuals in developing
countries. The possibilities are unlimited.&rdquo;

FreeFileSync</h2></div></div><p>
With FreeFileSync, you pay much less&mdash;that is, nothing&mdash;and get features that
usually are found only in the paid versions of competing folder comparison
and synchronization software utilities. This benefit, adds FreeFileSync's
developers, complements the fact that the software is free, open source and
works on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. FreeFileSync is optimized for both
CPU and file I/O performance. On an older PC, the software can scan a hard
drive with 200,000 files in less than three minutes. On a new PC with an SSD
drive, the same scan takes about ten seconds. With FreeFileSync, files can
be synchronized between two computers or between two hard drives on a
single machine. It works with local drives, external drives and over a
network. FreeFileSync also can copy locked files, perform binary file
comparisons and configure the handling of symbolic links. The utility's
innovative technology enables synchronization of files that have been moved
or renamed. And finally, users can automate their synchronization tasks by
running the utility as a batch job.

William McKnight's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Information Management</em></span> (Elsever/Morgan Kaufmann)</h2></div></div><p>
In his new book titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Information Management: Strategies for Gaining a
Competitive Advantage with Data</em></span>, tech author William McKnight shows how to
take actions that make the most of company information. In the book,
published by Elsever/Morgan Kaufmann, McKnight develops the value
proposition for information in the enterprise and succinctly outlines the
myriad forms of data storage that are now available. The big topics in this
practical, hands-on book include data warehousing and the importance of
information management and analytics; the technologies and data that
advance an organization and extend data warehouses; Big Data, NoSQL and
Hadoop; and chapters that unify these strands while addressing topics of
agile development, modern business intelligence and organizational change
management.

Janam Technologies' XG Series Mobile Computers</h2></div></div><p>
This top gun&mdash;Janam Technologies' XG Series gun-style mobile
computer&mdash;is now more flexible and versatile than ever thanks to the addition of
the Linux operating system. The XG Series is a line of rugged mobile
computers that scan bar codes and communicate wirelessly. The series was
designed for scan-intensive, extended shift use in demanding environments.
With its battery in the handle, Janam says that the XG Series line of
products is incomparably light and balanced in the hand and, in addition,
offers industrial-quality construction and efficiency-enhancing features,
such as well-spaced keys and mobile DDR memory. The Series includes the
XG100 device with Honeywell's Adaptus imaging technology and the XG105
device with Motorola's SE965 high-performance laser scan engine. Most
important, the company adds that the Linux option makes the XG series a
highly appealing alternative to bundled commercial systems, particularly
for retailers, manufacturers and government agencies.

Andrea Nierenberg's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential Business Networking</em></span> (Pearson)</h2></div></div><p>
The more the world changes, the truer remains the old adage: it's not what
you know, it's who you know. Certainly you've got to know something, but
you get the point. We Linuxers are indeed quirky, independent individuals,
often in need of a gentle push in the form of advice like Andrea
Nierenberg presents in the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential Business Networking: Tips, Tactics, and
Tools You Can Use</em></span>. Published by Pearson, this book is a simple
read, and a
selection of the author's top tips are organized into chapters that
represent logical steps for building a powerful network. One can start at
the beginning for an A to Z coverage of the topic. Or, if readers just
want to polish a certain skill, they can skip around to explore a
particular networking skill in-depth. The author has digested and
synthesized all of the tips and techniques into bite-sized action plans,
which allow for immediate implementation.

Compuware Workbench</h2></div></div><p>
The rise of Compuware Workbench illustrates that the mainframe is still
alive and kicking. Workbench is a modern, intuitive Eclipse-based mainframe
development environment that &ldquo;future-proofs&rdquo; a company's mainframe
assets. The need for Workbench is based on the fact that traditional
mainframe environments underpin large volume transactions across a number
of businesses, and these systems utilize a complex and antiquated mainframe
development environment, with which many newer developers are not familiar.
The Workbench gives new developers the tools to produce high-quality
applications that drive business success, as well as prevent application
outages and other business risks when experienced developers retire and
take their knowledge with them. The upgraded Workbench now features
significantly more robust data search and editing capabilities, additional
debugging support and a code-coverage reporting feature. Workbench also
has been more tightly integrated with Compuware APM for Mainframe and the
company's other developer productivity solutions.

Onset's HOBO UX120-006M Analog Logger</h2></div></div><p>
In the business of data logging, the name of the game is boosting accuracy
and memory while maintaining usability and not breaking the bank. Onsets's
newest draft pick, its own LeBron James, if you will, is the HOBO
UX120-006M Analog Logger, a device that fulfills the above criteria. The
model is a new high-performance, LCD display data logger for building
performance monitoring applications. The HOBO UX120-006M provides twice the
accuracy of previous models, a deployment-friendly LCD and support for up
to four external sensors for measuring temperature, current, CO2, voltage
and more. This enables energy engineers, facility managers and others to
solve a range of building performance applications
easily and affordably,
including energy audits, building commissioning studies and equipment
scheduling optimization. New deployment-related features, such as visual
confirmation of logger operation and battery status, eliminate the need to
connect the logger to a computer to view the information. The larger memory
capacity means that the logger can store up to 1.9 million measurements,
enabling the loggers to be deployed for longer periods between offloads.

Corsair's Hydro Series H105 Liquid CPU Cooler</h2></div></div><p>
Due in part to its innovative tool-free CPU mounting block, an independent
source rated Corsair's new Hydro Series H105 Liquid CPU Cooler as &ldquo;the
simplest mounting mechanism we have experienced&rdquo;. Corsair adds that the
H105 is the company's first Hydro Series cooler to be equipped with a 38mm-thick 240mm radiator, greatly increasing radiator surface area and
improving heat dissipation. Fitted with a pair of high-performance SP120L
PWM 120mm fans designed to balance static pressure and noise levels, the
H105 pushes liquid cooling performance to the next level in the 240mm
category. Connecting the cooling block and 38mm-deep 240mm radiator are a
pair of sealed and kink-resistant rubber tubes, with a high-quality
on-board ceramic-bearing pump providing reliable flow and heat transfer
away from the CPU. The H105 is completely self-contained, requires no
maintenance or filling and is supported by a five-year warranty.
