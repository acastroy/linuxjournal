You don't have to be an expert to apply usability tests in open-source
software. Anyone can do it. And with good usability, everyone wins.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d731f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Open-source software developers have created an array of amazing programs
that provide a great working environment with rich functionality. At
work and at home, I routinely run Linux on my desktop, using Firefox
and LibreOffice for most of my daily tasks. I prefer to run open-source
software tools, and I think most <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers do too. But as
comfortable as the open-source software ecosystem can be, we've all shared
or heard the same comments about some of our favorite Linux programs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;___ is a great program, once you figure out how to use
it.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;You can do a lot in ___, after you get past the awkward
menus.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;You'll like using ___, if you can learn the user interface.&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
That's the problem. No matter how powerful the program, that functionality
is lost if people have to figure out how to use the program in order
to unlock its secrets. Typical users with average knowledge should be
able to operate a general-purpose program. If a program is hard to use,
that suggests the problem is with the program, not with the user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d73828"></a>
Usability and Open-Source Software</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Usability&rdquo; refers to how easily users can learn and start using software,
or any similar &ldquo;information product&rdquo;. Usability is separate from the
functionality of the program, and so usability testing is different from
unit testing. Instead, usability testing allows us to uncover issues
that prevent users from using our programs.
</p><p>
Most open-source software programs are written by developers for
other developers. Although some large open-source programs, such as GNOME
and Drupal, have undergone usability testing, most projects lack the
resources or interest to pursue a usability evaluation. As a result,
open-source software programs often are utilitarian, focused on the
functionality and features, with little attention paid to how people will
use it. Applying usability practices tends to be antithetical to how
open-source software is created. Open-source developers prefer functionality
over appearance. Although some projects may have a maintainer who dictates
a particular design aesthetic, many more do not. In an interview for
this article, open-source advocate Eric Raymond commented to me that
most programmers view menus and icons &ldquo;like the frosting on a cake after
you've baked it&rdquo;, which is an apt metaphor. Open-source software developers tend
to prefer assembling the ingredients and baking the cake, not applying
frosting to make it look nice.
</p><p>
So how can open-source developers easily apply usability to their own
programs? There are many ways to implement usability practices. Alice
Preston described 11 different techniques to evaluate usability in the
STC Usability SIG newsletter. These methods run the gamut from interviews
and focus groups to heuristic reviews and formal usability tests:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Interviews and observations:
one-on-one sessions with users.
</p></li><li><p>
Focus groups:
often used in marketing well before there is any kind of prototype or product
to test, a facilitated meeting with multiple attendees from the target user
audience.
</p></li><li><p>
Group review or walk-through:
a facilitator presents planned work flow to multiple attendees, who comment on it.
</p></li><li><p>
Heuristic review:
using a predefined set of standards, a professional usability expert reviews
someone else's product or design and shares comments with the designer.
</p></li><li><p>
Walk-around review:
copies of the design or prototype are tacked to the walls of a conference
room, and testers are invited to examine them and make comments.
</p></li><li><p>
Do-it-yourself walk-through:
make mock-ups of the design, and use realistic scenarios to walk through the
design yourself.
</p></li><li><p>
Paper prototype test:
use realistic scenarios of a fake product that is still in design.
</p></li><li><p>
Prototype test:
a step up from the paper prototype, test an animated mock-up against
realistic scenarios.
</p></li><li><p>
Formal usability test:
using a stable product, an animated prototype or even a paper prototype, test
a reasonably large number of subjects against a controlled variety of
scenarios.
</p></li><li><p>
Controlled experiment:
a comparison of two products, with careful statistical balancing.
</p></li><li><p>
Questionnaires:
ask testers to complete a formal questionnaire about how they would use a
design.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
However, such formal usability practices tend to clash with the open-source
developer community and are like &ldquo;swimming against a strong
cultural headwind&rdquo;, to mix metaphors from Eric Raymond. With that in mind,
developers should consider a subset of usability methods that apply well
to the culture of open-source software. I propose this list:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Heuristic review.
</p></li><li><p>
Prototype test.
</p></li><li><p>
Formal usability test.
</p></li><li><p>
Questionnaires.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You don't need years of usability experience to apply good usability
practices in open-source software development. As suggested by usability
expert Janice (Ginny) Redish in numerous articles, you can learn a lot
just by sitting down with a few users and watching them use the software.
</p><p>
Whatever method you choose, the value of usability testing is in
practicing it during development, not after the fact. Apply usability
testing iteratively using prototypes, even paper-based mock-ups. At each
round of testing, you will identify a number of issues that you can
resolve for the next version. Successive usability tests will uncover
additional issues and further improve your project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d747a0"></a>
Applying Usability Tests to Your Own Programs</h2></div></div><p>
Let's walk through a usability test as an example. Remember, the purpose
of a usability test is to uncover issues that general users might have
in utilizing the program. It is not a functional test of the program's
features, but a practical test of its ease of operation, and as such,
it differs from quality assurance or unit testing.
</p><p>
To start, define a set of written scenarios that represent how typical
users with average knowledge would use the program. Don't look at every
feature of the program, just describe the tasks that most users would
want to do with the software. Make your scenarios realistic; provide
a short description of each scenario, and ask the tester to perform
tasks within that context. Use simple language; don't lead the tester
by using the product's own words to describe menu items or actions,
especially if typical users of average knowledge are unlikely to use
those words every day. For example, if you want to evaluate an editor,
your scenarios might ask the tester to type a short text document,
save it and make basic copy edits to the file. For a Web browser,
your scenarios could ask the user to search for a Web site, bookmark it
and save a copy of the Web page for off-line use.
</p><p>
Invite testers to join you for a usability test. Although you might think
you need a lot of users to evaluate a program's usability thoroughly, you
really need only about five testers to get useful results, as usability
expert Jakob Nielsen asserts in his research. Present the testers with
the scenarios, one at a time, each on a separate piece of paper, and
ask them to complete the tasks. Then simply observe what they do in the
program, the routes they take to accomplish the tasks and the problems
they encounter. Take plenty of notes.
</p><p>
The most difficult part of a usability test is watching a tester
struggle to locate a menu or button. Although the correct action might seem
apparent to you immediately, the value lies in learning and identifying
what is not obvious for other users. Do not give hints. If a tester
is unable to finish a scenario, that's okay; just move on to the next
scenario.
</p><p>
At the end of the scenarios, take a few minutes to ask follow-up questions
of your tester. Identify any areas that seemed particularly difficult
for the user. For example, you might ask &ldquo;You struggled when you tried
to do X; what would have made it easier?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What were you expecting to
see on the screen when you were doing Y?&rdquo; As a final wrap-up, ask the
tester to describe what worked well in the program and what features
should be improved.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d74ab8"></a>
Welcome to My Usability Test</h2></div></div><p>
I reviewed three common open-source projects in a formal usability
test. I did this both to demonstrate the usability test process and
to generate usability test results that could be generally applied to
other open-source programs. Choosing the programs for my study required
careful consideration. The ideal programs for my demonstration needed to
balance multiple qualities: not be too big, because very complex menus
can &ldquo;lose&rdquo; the audience in the details and confound the usability test
results, and not be too small, as trivial programs will not support generally
applicable conclusions. Further, the programs needed to be approachable
by general users.
</p><p>
I solicited advice on several on-line forums, asking which open-source
software programs had good usability. Sorting through the suggestions,
three projects matched the criteria for my usability test:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Gedit (a text editor for GNOME).
</p></li><li><p>
Firefox (a popular Web browser).
</p></li><li><p>
Nautilus (a file manager for GNOME).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Because I work on a university campus, I invited students, faculty, staff
and members of the public to participate in a usability study. I didn't
ask for a specific level of technological expertise, as I was looking for
typical users with average knowledge. In most formal usability tests,
it's common to present each tester with a small gratuity; I gave out
free pop and candy for them to take home with them after the test.
</p><p>
Although my preferred goal was about a dozen testers, I was satisfied with
the seven who participated in the usability test. They ranged in age
from about 20 to about 40, with three men and four women. Most testers
(five) claimed &ldquo;low&rdquo; experience with computers, and almost all (six)
used Windows as their primary desktop. Testers used separate guest
accounts on a laptop running Fedora 17 Desktop Edition, and so they started
from the same initial default settings.
</p><p>
At the start of the usability test, I gave each tester a brief context
of the usability study. I explained that this was a usability test,
so it was about the software, not about them. If the tester experienced
problems during the test, I let them know that would be okay, and we could
move on to the next section. I was there only to observe their interaction
with the software, not to judge their performance. Along the way, I said
I would take notes and watch what was happening on their screens.
</p><p>
I also asked the testers to speak aloud what was going through their mind
during the usability test. For example, if they were looking for a Print
button, they should simply say, &ldquo;I'm looking for a Print
button.&rdquo; And, I
encouraged them to track the mouse cursor on the screen with their eyes,
so I could observe where they were looking for menus and buttons.
</p><p>
During the usability test, I presented the testers with a number of
scenarios, each providing a brief context and an action they were to
complete. For example, after asking testers to navigate to the BBC News
Web site in the Firefox browser, one scenario asked them to increase the
size of the text on the screen. It's important to note that the scenario did not use
the same wording that was present in the menu action to apply the font
size change:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You don't have your glasses with you, so it's hard to read the text on the
BBC News Web site. Please make the text bigger on the BBC News Web site.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Overall,the usability test included 19 scenarios, which testers
completed in 30&ndash;40 minutes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x216d498"></a>
What Were the Usability Issues?</h2></div></div><p>
A heat map is a good way to represent the issues uncovered during a
usability test. In Figure 1, each row represents the task, and each
block represents a tester's experience. Green blocks indicate the tester
was able to complete the task easily, usually on the first attempt. Orange
and red blocks denote scenarios where the tester experienced difficulty
or was unable to complete the task, respectively.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11428f1.large.jpg"><img src="11428f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Usability Heat Map
</p></div></div><p>
Interestingly, almost everyone experienced the same four issues:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
G5: change the default font in Gedit.
</p></li><li><p>
G6: change the default colors in Gedit.
</p></li><li><p>
N4: create a bookmark or shortcut to a folder in Nautilus.
</p></li><li><p>
N6: search for a file in Nautilus.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In Gedit, testers were very confused about how to set the default font
and colors. Part of this confusion stemmed from thinking of the editor
as if it were a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, which uses items
on the toolbar to accomplish either action. Testers reported they were
looking for a menu item called &ldquo;Font&rdquo;. Failing that, testers also looked
in File, Edit, View and Tools.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11428f2.large.jpg"><img src="11428f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Gedit Screenshot&mdash;&ldquo;How to Change the Font?&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
In Nautilus, testers became frustrated while trying to create a bookmark
or shortcut to a folder, and the only user who successfully created the
bookmark later commented she did so by accident. As explained in the
scenario, the folder would be used for a project that collected photos
and was located in the Pictures folder.
</p><p>
The most common action was to go into the Pictures folder, click on the
project folder, then select &ldquo;Bookmarks - Add Bookmark&rdquo;. Nautilus doesn't
display messages to the effect that &ldquo;Add Bookmark&rdquo; only creates a bookmark
to the current location, not to a highlighted item, so testers were left
confused when nothing happened.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11428f3.large.jpg"><img src="11428f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Nautilus Screenshot&mdash;&ldquo;How to Create a Bookmark or
Shortcut to a Folder?&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
Similarly, most testers found searching for a file in Nautilus a difficult
task. They did not realize that the Search function starts from the
current folder, not from their Home directory. Only two testers were able
to use Search successfully. Of these, one happened to click on the Search
button from the home directory. The other tried changing options in the
drop-down Search action until eventually picking a combination that
worked. One tester gave up with Search and navigated into each folder
in turn to find the file. Another user opted not
to use Search at all, and used the same &ldquo;seek and find&rdquo; method.
</p><p>
And although GNOME was not part of the usability test, almost all testers
experienced difficulty with the GNOME &ldquo;Activities&rdquo; menu hot corner. In
the GNOME desktop environment, the Activities menu shows the list of
available programs plus a view of the running applications. Users can
bring up the Activities menu by clicking the menu icon in the upper-left
corner of the desktop or by moving the mouse into that corner (the
&ldquo;hot corner&rdquo;). Usually right away in the first scenario, testers would
&ldquo;overshoot&rdquo; the program menu they were looking for, and hit the GNOME
hot corner instead. This also occurred several other times throughout
the usability test. Although testers were able to recover from the hot
corner, it definitely caused frequent disruption.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x216e360"></a>
What Worked Well for Usability?</h2></div></div><p>
Throughout the study, I observed four themes of good usability that
allowed all testers to pass quickly through those parts of the usability
test:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Familiarity: testers commented that the programs seemed to operate more or
less like their counterparts in Windows or Mac OS X. For example, Gedit isn't
very different from Windows Notepad or even Microsoft Word. Firefox looks
like other Web browsers. Nautilus is quite similar to Windows Explorer or Mac
OS X Finder. To some extent, these testers had been &ldquo;trained&rdquo; under Windows
or Mac OS X, so having functionality (and paths to those features) that was
approximately equivalent to the Windows or Mac OS X experience was an
important part of their success.
</p></li><li><p>
Consistency: user interface consistency between the three programs worked
strongly in favor of the testers and was a recurring theme for good
usability. Right-click worked in all the programs to bring up a
context-sensitive menu. Programs looked and acted the same, so testers didn't
have to &ldquo;re-learn&rdquo; how to use the next program. Although the tool bars differed,
all programs shared a familiar menu system that featured File, Edit, View
and Help.
</p></li><li><p>
Menus:
testers preferred to access the programs' functionality from the menus rather
than via &ldquo;hot keys&rdquo; or icons on the toolbar. For example, the only toolbar
icon that testers used in the Gedit scenarios was the Save button. To
complete other scenarios, testers used the drop-down menus, such as File,
Edit, View and Help.
</p></li><li><p>
Obviousness: when an action produced a clear result, or clearly indicated
success (such as saving a file in the editor, creating a folder in the file
manager, opening a new tab in the Web browser), testers were able to 
move through the scenarios quickly. When an action did not produce obvious
feedback, the testers tended to become confused. The contrast was evident
when trying to create a bookmark or shortcut in the Nautilus file manager. In
this case, Nautilus did not indicate whether the bookmark had been
created, so testers were unsure if they had completed the
activity successfully.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11428f4.large.jpg"><img src="11428f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Firefox, Nautilus and Gedit Interface Comparison
</p></div></div><p>
These are good lessons in open-source software and usability. Your
program's user interface doesn't have to be a beautiful impediment to
understanding. Instead, leverage existing user interface paradigms.
Be consistent with other programs on the same platform, whether they are other
open-source software or proprietary programs. Use menus that are clearly
labeled. Ensure that every action has a result that is obvious to the end user,
especially if that result indicates a failure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x216ea98"></a>
Where Do We Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p>
Usability should not be something that's just tacked onto a project or
addressed only at the end of a development life cycle before releasing
the next version of the software. Usability needs to be part of the
design of open-source software, and addressed as part of a process. As
open-source software developers, we generally are very good at applying
good software development practices to our work. Now we need to take
the next step and bring usability into that methodology.
</p><p>
Our next challenge in open-source software is finding ways to incorporate
usability into our developer culture. This is a big step in open-source
software. To date, usability has been antithetical to how open-source
developers work. Most projects are written by developers for other
developers. Crafting new functionality takes priority, and we rarely
look at how our users will try to access those features.
</p><p>
In open-source software projects, the user community plays a strong
part in testing each new release. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on the
typical user-testing cycle to provide good usability feedback. Left on
their own with no structure to usability testing, open-source software
testers will respond with bland bug reports, such as &ldquo;This feature is
confusing.&rdquo; That's not helpful to a developer. In addition, usability
researchers David Nichols and Michael Twidale comment in their published
work that developers may not grant usability issues the same status
as functionality bugs, leading to an inherent developer bias against
usability bugs.
</p><p>
The approach to identify usability issues in open-source software,
therefore, needs to be more structured. Open-source software developers
can apply a variety of methods, although the ideal would be to conduct
formal usability tests with a handful of users. Remember, you need
only about five testers to get useful results.
</p><p>
Usability testing for open-source software projects doesn't need to be
performed in a stuffy lab environment; a project can find ways to &ldquo;crowd
source&rdquo; usability testing with the user community. For example, the
open-source Web content management system Drupal streamed testers' desktops
as they undertook a usability test. This allowed Drupal developers all
over the world to observe the usability test without having to travel
to a single location. When developers can watch testers experience
problems with their software, they better understand the issues and how
to address them.
</p><p>
Another simple method is usability testing by &ldquo;flash mob&rdquo;, a term
suggested by Dana Chisnell on her Usability Testing Howto blog. To
do testing via flash mobs, researchers simply can intercept people
in a public space and ask them to try a few scenarios against a paper
prototype and share their experiences. If each subject is willing to spare
a few minutes, a &ldquo;mob&rdquo; of such testers will provide valuable feedback in
a short amount of time. This idea of &ldquo;flash mob&rdquo; usability testing can
be extended to other domains too. If your open-source software project
is implemented as a Web site, you can conduct similar impromptu usability
tests by intercepting Web visitors.
</p><p>
You don't have to be an expert to apply usability tests in open-source
software. Anyone can do it. You only need to watch users try to use
a program, and usability issues quickly will become clear. A handful
of testers operating against a prototype can give you the feedback you
need to make your open-source software even easier to use. And with good
usability, everyone wins.
