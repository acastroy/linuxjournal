Apache CloudStack</h2></div></div><p>
Apache CloudStack is an integrated Infrastructure-as-a-Service software
platform that allows users to build feature-rich public and private cloud
environments. Our contacts over at the Apache Software Foundation informed
us that the new version 4.2, sporting 57 new and 29 improved features, and
160+ fixes, is available for immediate download. This release represents
more than six months of work from the Apache CloudStack community. New
integrated support of the Cisco UCS compute chassis, SolidFire storage
arrays and the S3 storage protocol are just a few of the features
available in this release. Both the official source code release and
convenience binaries are available on the Apache CloudStack download page.

Confirming its commitment to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 platform's
ten-year lifecycle, Red Hat ratcheted up RHEL's version number to 5.10,
signaling a batch of noteworthy new features. With an emphasis on providing
greater stability for critical applications, RHEL 5.10 offers enhanced

Technology's (NIST) SCAP 1.2 standard. Beyond OpenSCAP, the new release
includes MySQL 5.5, enhanced subscription management tools, the new Red
Hat Access support tools and Red Hat Developer Toolset 2.0.

EnerPlex's Surfr Series Smartphone Cases</h2></div></div><p>
Convert your smartphone into a solar-electric hybrid model with the new
solar-powered Surfr Series smartphone cases from EnerPlex. With a Surfr
case on your Samsung Galaxy S III or Apple iPhone 4 or 4S, you can set
yourself free from the outlet and enjoy hours of extra talk/text/surf time
thanks to an on-board internal battery and a series of copper indium
gallium selenide (CIGS) solar cells. The cases are thin (15mm thick for
the Galaxy S III model) and light (69 grams), and their hardened plastic
construction protects your smartphone from scratches and dings. A wall
charger is included for indoor charging. EnerPlex products are the consumer
side of Ascent Solar, a developer of thin-film CIGS solar technology.

Percona Server</h2></div></div><p>
The value proposition of the new Percona Server 5.6&mdash;an open-source
drop-in replacement for MySQL&mdash;says Percona, is that it includes much
of the same functionality of MySQL 5.6 Enterprise Edition yet comes as a
free download. The new 5.6 release, adds Percona, offers all the
improvements found in MySQL 5.6 Community Edition plus scalability,
availability, backup and security features found only in MySQL 5.6
Enterprise Edition, which requires an Oracle support contract to access.
Superior diagnostics and improved integration with other Percona software
also are included&mdash;for example, Percona Server 5.6 can be migrated to Percona
XtraDB Cluster to create a high-availability MySQL cluster. Percona notes
that by removing many resource contentions that slow MySQL 5.6 Community
Edition, Percona Server 5.6 delivers better performance at more than 150
concurrent threads and up to 4x better performance at 1,000 or more
concurrent threads. Percona's stated open &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to remaining more
advanced and current than the latest release of MySQL, yet being
drop-in-compatible, is its penchant for pushing out bug fixes and performance
enhancements faster than Oracle.

Josh More's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Job Reconnaissance</em></span> (Syngress)</h2></div></div><p>
Most people's limiting factor in getting a better job, says book publisher
Syngress, is not technical skills or even the soft skills necessary to do
well in a new job. But rather it is that getting a job is a completely
different skill set and one that most people practice only periodically.
Master job-search skills and get the job you deserve with Syngress' new
Josh More book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Job Reconnaissance: Using Hacking Skills to Win the
Job Hunt Game</em></span>. As the subtitle suggests, the book seeks to inform infosec
and IT job seekers about leveraging the same skills they use in penetration
testing and recon toward job-hunting success. These skills include
targeting, reconnaissance and profiling combined with a technical look at
skills other career search books commonly miss. The book covers the entire
job-hunt process from deciding when to leave your current job to the
departure of your current job, suggests how to research new possible job
opportunities and illustrates how to target your new boss, from controlling
the job interview process to negotiating compensation.

(with Johannes Braams, David Carlisle and Chris Rowley)
2nd ed. (Addison-Wesley
Professional)</h2></div></div><p>
It was 1993 when the

paragraphs to headings, lists and pages. Nearly 1,000 fully tested,
ready-to-run examples that illustrate the text and solve typographical and

Flowfinity Wireless Inc.'s Flowfinity Actions</h2></div></div><p>
Empowering employees to be more productive everywhere, whether in or out of
network coverage, is Flowfinity Wireless Inc.'s &ldquo;mission
possible&rdquo; with
Flowfinity Actions. Flowfinity Actions 7.5 is the latest version of the
firm's flexible application software that supports cross-platform
enterprise app creation without programming. The premier improvement in
this latest release is the ability for users to save current progress and
switch between multiple Flowfinity apps with or without network
connectivity. This is especially useful when performing data collection
tasks, such as pipeline inspections, agricultural management and remote
construction site reporting, which require diverse information to be
gathered or accessed when no Internet connection is available. Another new
off-line feature is parameter or filter-based search, enabling users to
filter through thousands of records quickly to find the information they
need at any time. Finally, lookups that allow information to be stored in
one app and copied into another app also are fully supported off-line.
