It's complicated and time consuming, but totally worth it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b16358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been a sysadmin for a long time, and part of being a sysadmin
is doing more than is humanly possible. Sometimes that means writing
wicked cool scripts, sometimes it means working late, and sometimes
it means learning to say no. Unfortunately, it also sometimes means
cutting corners. I confess, I've been &ldquo;that guy&rdquo; more than once. A good
example is SELinux. On more than a few (hundred!) occasions, I've simply
disabled SELinux, because getting things to work right is often really
frustrating and time consuming. The same is true with LVM (Logical Volume
Manager). I didn't get
it. I thought it added an unnecessary layer of complexity. I thought it
meant another potential point of failure. I thought it was stupid.
</p><p>
I was wrong.
</p><p>
LVM is an incredibly flexible, ridiculously
useful and not terribly complicated to use system. It makes life
easier. It makes future storage upgrades and migrations simple. Quite
simply, I love it. So in this article, I cover the concepts and usage
of LVM. By the time I'm done, hopefully you'll love it as much as I do!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b16568"></a>
What LVM Is</h2></div></div><p>
The best analogy I can come up with for explaining LVM is a SAN. If
you've ever used a SAN (Storage Area Network) in your server environment,
you know it abstracts the idea of individual hard drives and allows you
to carve out &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; of space to use as drives. Rather than worrying
about how big your hard drives might be, a SAN lets you throw all your
hard drives into a big chassis and then allocate space to individual
clients without being concerned about how many or how few physical drives
are being used. LVM is sort of like that, but for an individual system
rather than an entire network.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows my poor attempt at drawing the concept of an LVM system. At
first glance, it might seem like using an LVM is silly. Why combine a
bunch of drives together, only to carve them up into virtual drives,
right? Thankfully, that simple concept gives incredible flexibility down
the road. Need a great big partition, but have only a bunch of smaller
disks? No problem. Have only a couple disks now, but want to add more
later without reformatting? No problem. Need to take snapshots, like with
virtual servers, but you're using actual bare metal? No problem. LVM
makes dealing with storage far better than partitioning drives or using
a simple RAID setup (which, incidentally, brings me to the next issue).

second-grade art.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b16930"></a>
What LVM Isn't</h2></div></div><p>
With all the flexibility and expandability I mentioned in the previous
paragraph, it seems like LVM would be a perfect replacement for hardware-
or software-based RAID. After all, one of the big advantages of RAID is
that multiple smaller drives can be used as a single, larger drive. For
that particular feature, LVM is indeed ideal. Unfortunately, however,
LVM doesn't provide any options for redundancy or parity. That means if
you have a drive fail in LVM, you lose data. There's no such thing as
striped LVM or mirrored LVM; it's simply not designed to do that.
</p><p>
LVM also isn't designed to increase speed by striping reads and writes
across multiple disks. As block devices in the volume group fill up, such
simultaneous read/writes may occur, but it's not by design and certainly
not to gain speed. Hopefully, it's clear: LVM is really cool, but it is not
in any way a replacement for RAID. Thankfully, it doesn't need to be.
</p><p>
(Note: recent versions of LVM actually do provide striping and mirroring
features. In some cases, it can take the place of RAID completely. I still
think understanding them as separate concepts is important. If you want
to learn more about LVM and utilize the RAID features, I'll leave that as
an exercise for you.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b16b40"></a>
Two Peas in a Pod</h2></div></div><p>
If you look at the first &ldquo;stage&rdquo; in my drawing (Figure 1), you'll notice
that I didn't call the 10GB chunks &ldquo;drives&rdquo;; I called them physical
volumes. That's because although it's certainly possible to use a physical
drive as a physical volume in LVM, it's not a requirement. In fact,
it's not even the most common scenario. In most production environments,
LVM is used in combination with RAID. Whether that's hardware-based RAID
or software-based RAID, having your underlying physical volumes exist
as RAID devices is ideal.
</p><p>
As someone who has had problems with hardware-based RAID arrays, I tend to
lean toward software-based RAID in my systems. That's certainly a matter
of personal preference, but it's good to know that since software-based
RAID and LVM both operate at the kernel level, both are extremely
efficient. Software-based RAID admittedly uses some CPU, especially when
rebuilding arrays, but LVM uses very little. If I/O performance is of
utmost importance for your purposes, it's worth doing some research
and possibly testing before committing to any solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b16d50"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's certainly possible to transition to an LVM system after
Linux is already installed, it's far more preferable to do so during
the initial setup. Most distributions allow for LVM setup to take place
during the installation process, and in the case of CentOS and RHEL,
LVM is used by default. Even if you're installing only onto a single,
non-RAID hard drive, setting up LVM allows you flexibility and expansion
opportunity later. Heck, it's possible to add RAID to a server later on,
then simply migrate the data from your original physical volume to the
RAID physical volume. That's far easier than using <tt  >dd</tt>, especially when
you'd like to keep your server running!
</p><p>
Because this is an introduction, let me start with a simplistic setup. Let's
say you have two hard drives, /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. With LVM, any block
device can be used as a physical volume (PV), which means you 
can use either partitions or entire drives. If you need to have a
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo;
partition (in some cases, the /boot partition might need to be on a
regular, non-LVM device), be sure to partition the drive before adding
the physical volumes to your volume group. In this example, let's
use the raw disks themselves.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b16f60"></a>
Step 1: Create Physical Volumes</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have the block devices you want to add to your volume group
(again, keep referring to my drawing if the terms get confusing), you
need to establish them as LVM physical volumes. To do that, use the
<tt  >pvcreate</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pvcreate /dev/sdb
pvcreate /dev/sdc
</pre>
</p><p>
These commands configure the drives as potential candidates to be added
to a volume group. If you want to make sure it worked correctly, you
can type <tt  >pvdisplay</tt> or <tt  >pvscan</tt> to show the status of any existing LVM
Physical Volumes:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo pvdisplay
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdb
  VG Name               
  PV Size               10.4 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              4994
  Free PE               4994
  Allocated PE          0
  PV UUID               SRKAXh-EpYr-r2td-g0gA-31RA-fnfz-3qqGrO
   
  --- Physical volume ---
  PV Name               /dev/sdc
  VG Name               
  PV Size               10.4 GiB / not usable 3.00 MiB
  Allocatable           yes 
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              4994
  Free PE               4994
  Allocated PE          0
  PV UUID               t2cKru-IwMy-I8re-ADp2-vzFF-Tvh5-O4zMhI
</pre>
</p><p>
And, the simpler <tt  >pvscan</tt>:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo pvscan
  PV /dev/sdb         lvm2 [10.4 GiB]
  PV /dev/sdc         lvm2 [10.4 GiB]
  Total: 2 [20.8 GiB] / in use: 0 [0 ] / in no VG: 2 [20.8 GiB]
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you create the volume group and logical volumes, go ahead and run these
commands again to see how the information changes. The differences
should be obvious and should make sense.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b17488"></a>
Step 2: the Volume Group</h2></div></div><p>
You don't currently have any volume groups, so create one using
the two physical volumes you just made:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vgcreate my_volume_group /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
</pre>
</p><p>
Hopefully the command is clear. You've created a volume group named
my_volume_group using the physical volumes /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. As
with the physical volumes, if you want to check the current state
of LVM Volume Groups on your system, type <tt  >vgdisplay</tt> to get a listing:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo vgdisplay
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               my_volume_group
  System ID             
  Format                lvm2
  Metadata Areas        2
  Metadata Sequence No  1
  VG Access             read/write
  VG Status             resizable
  MAX LV                0
  Cur LV                0
  Open LV               0
  Max PV                0
  Cur PV                2
  Act PV                2
  VG Size               20.8 GiB
  PE Size               4.00 MiB
  Total PE              9988
  Alloc PE / Size       0 / 0 GiB
  Free  PE / Size       9988 / 20.8 GiB
  VG UUID               oVYiY6-bQp9-4CVO-QgrN-LGgB-1umR-ebJQo4
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see in the output, you've combined the available space of the
two physical volumes (10.4GB each) into a total pool of 20.8GB. You could
add more drives to the volume group or mix and match entire drives with
partitions from other drives. LVM is very flexible. The large pool of
available data does no good, however, until you create Logical Volumes
to act as your usable disks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b177a0"></a>
Step 3: Logical Volumes</h2></div></div><p>
When you add a hard drive to your system, you don't really get to pick its
name. You get /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and so on. When you create logical volumes,
however, you decide what you want the devices to be called. You also get
to decide how large each &ldquo;drive&rdquo; is as you carve it out of the larger
volume group. It's good to note here that if you make your logical
volumes too small, it's very easy to expand them later, so don't worry
too much about planning for long-term potential needs. If you need more
space later, you can just add it. To create your logical volumes, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvcreate -L 5G -n 5gig my_volume_group
  Logical volume "5gig" created
</pre>
</p><p>
Then to see what happened behind the scenes, type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo lvdisplay
  --- Logical volume ---
  LV Path                /dev/my_volume_group/5gig
  LV Name                5gig
  VG Name                my_volume_group
  LV UUID                3MxOB0-ce5o-yvBD-YORT-52qV-j8HJ-oDru2G
  LV Write Access        read/write
  LV Status              available
  # open                 0
  LV Size                5.0 GiB
  Current LE             5753
  Segments               1
  Allocation             inherit
  Read ahead sectors     auto
  - currently set to     256
  Block device           252:0
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how nice and clean the device-naming system is with LVM. It's
important to run the <tt  >lvdisplay</tt> command, however, to make sure you know
the mapped device name. Many systems use symbolic linking in an attempt
to make the device's virtual locations easier to find, but I think that
adds a layer of confusion for folks trying to understand what's really
going on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1b17b68"></a>
Look, a New (Virtual) Hard Drive!</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've successfully created your logical volumes, it's just a matter
of using them as block devices. If you need a filesystem to mount as
your /home directory, just do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_volume_group/5gig
$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/my_volume_group/5gig /home
</pre>
</p><p>
And, your /home directory will be a whopping 5GB in size, but
fully expandable, thanks to LVM. (Obviously, if you really want to mount
your logical volume as your home directory, you should add an entry to
/etc/fstab so it mounts on boot.) From the standpoint of your Linux system,
however, /dev/my_volume/5gig is a block device similar to any hard drive
you might plug in. You can use it as swap, format it like you did above,
or even encrypt it and mount it somewhere as an encrypted partition.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1f0ff70"></a>
That Was a Lot of Work, Why Again?</h2></div></div><p>
I know, in this little example, you've done nothing but create a JBOD
(Just a Bunch Of Disks) type system, which will completely fail if you
lose even one drive. The power of LVM isn't fully realized until down
the road when you want to expand your logical volumes without migrating
data. Or, when you want to take an LVM snapshot of your drive so you can roll
back to an instantaneous backup when an upgrade fails. Or, when you replace a
small drive with a fast RAID array and want to migrate the data
quietly to your new PV.
</p><p>
The Logical Volume Manager is a system that abstracts storage devices. It
does add a layer of complexity to your system, I won't lie, but the
trade-off is significant. It may complicate your system a bit more,
but it also simplifies your work a great deal when you have to deal with
storage in the future.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1e580.0x1f100d0"></a>
You Keep Talking about the Future...</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully at this point, you see LVM isn't a complete waste of time. When
the time comes, what sorts of advantages will LVM provide? Here's a
quick off-the-top-of-my-head list you might want to check out:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Move Logical Volumes from old, slow PVs to new, fast PVs, on the fly.
</p></li><li><p>
Resize Logical Volumes, filling more space in the Volume Group.
</p></li><li><p>
Stripe data across PVs in a VG for increased performance.
</p></li><li><p>
Resize Volume Groups by adding or subtracting physical volumes.
</p></li><li><p>
Take a snapshot of any Logical Volume, which can be restored later.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One of my favorite uses for LVM in production is to take an LVM snapshot
before an upgrade. If something goes wrong, I can just revert back to
the snapshot. Once you start thinking about all the possibilities LVM
offers, you'll wonder why you waited so long!
