<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #236, December 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There have been a number of attempts to make Linux able to isolate
<span   class="bold"><b>CPUs</b></span> and
other hardware resources, effectively guaranteeing access to those
resources to the particular processes that need them.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Christopher Lameter</b></span> recently posted his own attempt. His code operated very
early in the boot cycle, so it could prevent any startup d&aelig;mons from
getting onto the CPUs in question.
</p><p>
There immediately was a discussion of whether to redo these patches as
enhancements to things like <span   class="bold"><b>isolcpus</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cpusets</b></span>, which provided similar
features. Everyone seemed to be in favor of the feature set, but no one
seemed satisfied with the existing solutions or with Christopher's
version.
</p><p>
According to <span   class="bold"><b>Mike Galbraith</b></span>, isolcpus, for
example, apparently is being
taken out of the kernel at some point, although like Christopher's code, it
operates at a very early stage of the boot cycle. But, as <span   class="bold"><b>Gilad Ben-Yossef</b></span>
said, cpusets, on the other hand, started later in the boot cycle and
wasn't able to handle certain types of process migration, but it was more
elegantly written, which counts for a lot, in Linux.
</p><p>
One possibility was to keep isolcpus around and enhance it with
Christopher's code, but take out most of the rest of its code, leaving it
just a configuration tool for cpusets. But Christopher nixed that idea,
saying that isolcpus was actually broken and insane, and simply had to go.
</p><p>
As it turned out, even cpusets was not immune and was slated to be
replaced by cgroups, a <span   class="bold"><b>Google</b></span> project to provide similar features not just
for CPUs, but for memory and all other resources on the system.
</p><p>
The real difficulty with any of these solutions seems to be correctly
handling all the various cases that may arise. Migrating threads may leave
child threads behind that also need to be migrated. There are potential
race conditions. And some groups of users, like banks and financial
institutions, want these features to co-exist with nearly bare-metal
control over the system as possible. How can all this be arranged?
</p><p>
It remains unclear. But ideas keep bubbling up, code keeps getting written,
and at some point, something is bound to strike a chord with everybody.
</p><p>
In case you're wondering, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> doesn't use backups. He had a hard
disk crash recently and talked about it, so we got to see a bit of how he
deals with such things.
</p><p>
Apparently, the crash did cost him a few days of work. But he remarked,
&ldquo;I
long ago gave up on doing backups. I have actively moved to a model where I
use replaceable machines instead. I've got the stuff I care about generally
on a couple of different machines, and then keys etc backed up on a
separate encrypted USB key.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> said he did a similar thing, because disk drives just
weren't reliable enough. He said he always mirrored his main system disk
onto other computers. 
</p><p>
It's unusual for a whole hardware architecture to be taken out of the
kernel tree, but it can happen. <span   class="bold"><b>Guenter
Roeck</b></span> recently pointed out that the
<span   class="bold"><b>H8/300 architecture</b></span> hadn't worked for years and wouldn't even compile.
</p><p>
Guenter posted a patch to gut the code, but he also invited discussion to
make sure no one was working on resuscitating it. Through a fluke, he left
the H8/300 maintainer, <span   class="bold"><b>Yoshinori Sato</b></span>, off
the cc list, but <span   class="bold"><b>Joe Perches</b></span>
caught that and added him back in.
</p><p>
Barring any objections, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> said he fully supported the
patch and pointed out that they always could undo the git commit if it
turned out someone wanted it back. <span   class="bold"><b>David S.
Miller</b></span> also saw no need to keep
dead code alive, as did <span   class="bold"><b>Wim Van Sebroeck</b></span>.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds said he was fine with taking out the code. It was a big
patch, but because it was a whole architecture, it was relatively isolated
from the rest of the kernel and posed little threat to anything else.
</p><p>
It's possible there may be a delay, as <span   class="bold"><b>Geert
Uytterhoeven</b></span> wanted to give
Yoshinori a chance to discuss the issue in person at the <span   class="bold"><b>Kernel Summit</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span> has introduced a new system call to swap the names of two
files. His <span   class="bold"><b>rename2()</b></span> system call made certain kinds of filesystem
operations atomic, where they hadn't been before. He gave the example of
replacing a directory tree with a symlink.
</p><p>
Another value of the patch, Miklos said, was its ability to handle
whiteouts in <span   class="bold"><b>union filesystems</b></span>. In a union filesystem, where multiple
filesystems are overlayed, a whiteout allows the user to delete a file in
the visible union, even if the file itself happens to be on a read-only
filesystem. The file is &ldquo;whited out&rdquo; of the overlay, so the user no longer
sees it.
</p><p>
His rename2() system call would make that type of situation much cleaner,
although Miklos acknowledged that there were some cases that 
still would have problems. 
</p><p>
There was some talk of extending rename2() to allow a more complex, yet
more flexible behavior, but Linus Torvalds said that Miklos's patch was
actually a simplified version of an earlier effort that had been too
complicated for Linus' liking. Linus said, &ldquo;I was actually very relieved
to see this much simpler and cleaner model, because the alternative really
was nasty.&rdquo;

I've mentioned geocaching before, but if you've never taken the time
to go out and do it, you're really missing out. Whether you're dragging
your family through two feet of snow in the middle of the woods (yeah, I
did that last year, I'm still not sure they've forgiven me) or following
your GPS around a parking lot looking for a tiny micro-cache, geocaching
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span>. You need only a few things to go geocaching:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A sense of adventure.
</p></li><li><p>
Friends or family (not required, but more fun).
</p></li><li><p>
A sharp mind (there often are brain puzzles involved).
</p></li><li><p>
A GPS or smartphone app to guide you.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
That's where c:geo comes in. There are several geocaching apps for
Android, and they vary in price from free to very not free. The c:geo
app is one of the free ones, and it also happens to be one of the best. It
will show you clues, help you find local geocaches and guide you on a
map to the GPS location you need. Whether you're a hard-core geocacher
or just want to go out for a little fun with the family, c:geo is
a great tool for your Android device that will make geocaching easier
and more enjoyable. You can find it in the Google Play Store.

</p></div></div><p>
Because it's such an incredible application, and because it relates to our
three favorite F words (Free, Family, Fun), c:geo gets our Editors' Choice
award this month. Download it now, and get out there and find stuff: <a href="http://www.cgeo.org" target="_self">www.cgeo.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Let's Make Music Together</h2>

Just because you're not on Linux doesn't mean you can't have awesome open-source tools. I was having a conversation with a friend and reader (Don
Crowder: @eldergeek) on Twitter the other day about music theory. Yes,
I'm not just a computer nerd, but a music/math nerd too. Anyway after our
conversation, I started looking for an open-source program for creating
sheet music. Not only was I able to find one, but it happens to work
for those folks on Windows as well as Linux.
</p><p>
Mind you, I'm a neophyte when it comes to music theory, but thankfully,
MuseScore is useful for experts and n00bs alike. Not only can you create
sheet music, but you also can download thousands of pieces others have created
and shared on the Web site.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11594fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11594fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you're a Windows user who wants to dabble in sheet music, but can't
afford something like &ldquo;Finale&rdquo;, MuseScore is right up your alley. If
you're a musician who wants to give back, please join the community of
users and contribute some of your music. To see how MuseScore is helping
blind musicians, check out Katherine Druckman's article on our Web site:

</p><p>
If you want to download MuseScore for yourself, you can download it from
your repositories if you're on Linux, or download the installer from
the Web site for Windows or OS X: <a href="http://www.musescore.com" target="_self">www.musescore.com</a>.

Don't get me wrong, I love The GIMP. We all love The GIMP, as our Readers'
Choice awards show this month. If I'm being completely honest, however, I
rarely have the need for such a powerful application. Usually, regardless
of what computer system I'm on, I pick Pixlr as my image editing program.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11594pixf1.large.jpg"><img src="11594pixf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Pixlr is a Web-based image editing tool that rivals native applications
in speed, and more important, in functionality. Powerful tools like
&ldquo;spot heal&rdquo; that aren't found in most simple image editors are essential for
folks like me who still get teenager-like pimples in their late 30s. It
also integrates with on-line storage (Flickr, Picasa, Facebook) and allows
simple uploads/downloads to your local computer. In fact, you have to
look really hard in order to realize Pixlr isn't a native application.
</p><p>
Regardless of what operating system you're on, you can check out Pixlr
right now by heading to <a href="http://pixlr.com/editor" target="_self">pixlr.com/editor</a>. It's not GIMP, but
it certainly isn't gimpy either.

If, like me, you've jumped onto the Plex bandwagon with both feet,
you've probably discovered how difficult it is to make a standalone Plex
player. Sure, you can install an entire OS, then auto-start the Plex
program in full screen, but it's not as simple as installing the XBMC
distro, or even OpenELEC. If you own a Raspberry Pi, that has all changed.
</p><p>
RasPlex is a custom Linux distribution based on the popular (and awesome)
OpenELEC Raspberry Pi port. Rather than installing XBMC on an RPi,
however, RasPlex installs the Plex Home Theater application. Granted,
the Raspberry Pi does struggle with menu speed in Plex until the cache
of thumbnails is built, but with a developer focusing strictly on making
Plex work for the RPi, those caching issues will be solved soon!

<h2 class="title">Tinker with Molecular Dynamics for Fun and Profit</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #236, December 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Molecular dynamics computations make up a very large proportion of
the computer cycles being used in science today. For those of you who
remember chemistry and or thermodynamics, you should recall that all of
the calculations you made were based on treating the material
in question as a homogeneous mass where each part of the mass simply has
the average value of the relevant properties. Under average conditions,
this tends be adequate most times. But, more and more scientists were
running into conditions that would be on the fringes of where they
could apply those types of generalizations. 
</p><p>
Enter molecular dynamics, or
MD. With MD, you have to move down almost to the lowest level of matter
that we know of, the level of atoms and molecules. At this level, most
of the forces you are dealing with are electrical in nature. Atoms and
molecules interact with each other through their electron clouds.
Several packages are available for doing this type of work, such as GROMACS
and GAMESS. In this article though, I take look at TINKER.
</p><p>
Unlike most of the software I've covered in this space, TINKER
isn't available in the package systems of most distributions. This means
you will have to go out and download it from the main Web
site. There are binary files for Linux (32-bit and 64-bit), Mac OS X and
Windows (32-bit and 64-bit). Although these should work in many cases, you
probably will want to download the source code and build it with the exact
options you want. You can download either a tarball or a
zip file containing the source code for TINKER. 
</p><p>
Once it is unpacked, change
directory to the tinker subdirectory. There are a number of subdirectories
named after the various operating system options available. Because you're
using Linux, you will want to move to the linux subdirectory. 
</p><p>
You
will find a series of subdirectories for each of a number of possible
compilers. For this article, I chose to use the gfortran compiler. Inside
the gfortran subdirectory, you will find a number of scripts to handle
each of the build steps. The first step is to run
<tt  >compile.make</tt> to
build all of the required objects. These scripts need to be run from
the location where the source code resides, so once you know which
set of scripts you are going to use, move over to the subdirectory
tinker/source. From here, I ran
<tt  >../linux/gfortran/compile.make</tt>
to compile all of the source code I needed into object files. 
</p><p>
The
next step is to combine these into a single library file by running
<tt  >../linux/gfortran/library.make</tt>. The last step is to do the linking
with the system libraries to create a final executable. This is done by
running <tt  >../linux/gfortran/link.make</tt>. 
</p><p>
You now will have a full set of
executable files, recognizable by filenames that end with .x. These
executable files then can be moved to any other location 
to make them easier to use.
</p><p>
You should find that 61 different executable files have been created. Each
of these executables handles some separate task in the analyses that
TINKER is designed to do. I look at only a few
different executables here to give you a flavor of the types of tasks that
you can do. 
</p><p>
The first is <tt  >analyze.x</tt>. This executable will ask for
a structure file (in the TINKER .xyz file format) and the type of
analysis to run. The output you get back includes the following items:
the total potential energy of the system; the breakdown of the energy
by potential function type or over individual atoms; the computation
of the total dipole moment and its components, moments of inertia and
radius of gyration; the listing of the parameters used to compute
selected interaction energies; and the energies associated with
specified individual interactions. 
</p><p>
The next executable, <tt  >dynamic.x</tt>,
performs a molecular dynamic or stochastic dynamic computation. On an
initial computation, it will take a .xyz structure file as input. If a
previous computation was check-pointed, you can use the resultant dynamics
trajectory file (or restart file) as input too. These two programs are
both deterministic in their methods. 
</p><p>
The executable <tt  >monte.x</tt> provides a
way to apply Monte Carlo minimization methods to molecular dynamics. It
takes a random step for either a single atom or a single torsional angle,
then applies the Metropolis sampling method. 
</p><p>
The <tt  >scan.x</tt> executable takes
a .xyz structure file as input and finds an initial local minimum. From
this first local minimum, the program starts searching out along normal
modes to try to find other minima. Once it has searched along each of
these modes, it then will terminate. 
</p><p>
A number of these 61 executables are
support utility programs that do non-computational work. For example,
the executables <tt  >xyzint.x</tt> and
<tt  >intxyz.x</tt> convert back and forth between
the .xyz structure file format and the .int internal coordinates
formatted file. 
</p><p>
For all of these programs, the specific details of how
they work is determined by a keyword file (with a filename ending with
.key). TINKER uses a huge number of keywords to decide
the specifics of any particular run. For example, you could set a single
bond stretching parameter with the keyword BOND. The keyword CHARGE
will set a single atomic partial charge electrostatic parameter. A full
listing of the keywords is available in the TINKER documentation.
</p><p>
All of these executables are designed to run as command-line programs. The
output tends to be files of numbers, which are hard for a human to
evaluate. The group who created TINKER also created a program called
Force Field Explorer (FFE).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11594tinkerf1.large.jpg"><img src="11594tinkerf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. On initial startup, you will get an empty project window and a
TINKER console.
</p></div></div><p>
The executables built above
are not compiled to interface with FFE as is. If you want to compile your
own copy and have it interact with FFE, it requires changing a number of
source files. In this case, I would suggest that you go ahead and download
one of the installation packages that include FFE. These come as a gzipped
shell archive. After gunzipping it, you can run the shell script to start
up the Java-based installer. It will let you select which portions to
install along with FFE. Once it is all done, go ahead and start up FFE. It
will open up the main window and a console window. From within FFE, you
can load up structure files and start various TINKER analyses. 
</p><p>
When
you first open an .xyz file, the structure is rendered and displayed
in the main window. You then can select the Modeling Commands tab to
select which specific TINKER analysis to run. By default,
these TINKER runs happen locally on the same machine, but it doesn't
have to be this way. FFE gives you the option of connecting to a remote
machine, likely more powerful than your desktop, and getting the actual
TINKER programs to run over there. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11594tinkerf2.large.jpg"><img src="11594tinkerf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You have access to all of the TINKER analysis routines, directly
from FFE.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have results, you can change
the visual details like colors and whether to use wireframe or tube and
so on. You also have the option of exporting a visual as an image file
in one of several file formats.
</p><p>
I easily could fill the entire contents of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> 
just covering the most basic functionality TINKER provides. Hopefully,
you will have seen enough to get an idea of whether this software might
be of use to you. If so, a rather large amount of detailed
documentation is available at the main TINKER Web site.
