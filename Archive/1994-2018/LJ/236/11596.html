Linux is pretty much an all-male project. Let's change that.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c5580.0x13bd300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, nearly 100% of our subscribers are male. So are all
of our editors and regular writers, with the single exception of the one in
charge. Consistent with that, our publisher and Webmistress are both
female. So is our entire ownership. I bring this up because I believe women
have leadership advantages that most guys&mdash;especially in tech&mdash;fail to respect, mostly because we were poorly taught to respect them.
Garrison Keillor (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison_Keillor" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrison_Keillor</a>) explains this in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of Guys</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Book-Guys-Garrison-Keillor/dp/0140233725" target="_self">www.amazon.com/The-Book-Guys-Garrison-Keillor/dp/0140233725</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Here's what they won't tell you in class:
</p><p>
Girls had it better from the beginning, don't kid yourself. They were
allowed to play in the house, where the books were and the adults, and boys
were sent outdoors like livestock. Boys were noisy and rough, and girls
were nice, so they got to stay and we had to go. Boys ran around in the
yard with toy guns going <span   class="emphasis"><em>kkshh-kkshh</em></span>, fighting wars for made-up reasons and
arguing about who was dead, while girls stayed inside and played with
dolls, creating complex family groups and learning to solve problems
through negotiation and role-playing. Which gender is better equipped, on
the whole, to live an adult life, would you guess? ...Is there any doubt
about this? Is it even close?
</p><p>
...Men adore women. Our mothers taught us to. Women do not adore men; women
are amused by men, we are a source of chuckles. That's because women
are the makers of life, and we aren't. We will never breast-feed. We get
more than our share of loot and we are, for some reason, incredibly brave
and funny and inventive, and yet our role in procreation basically is to
get crazy and howl and spray our seed in all directions.
</p><p>
So we carry adolescence around in our bodies all our lives.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Later he adds this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Spectacular dumbness is a guy type of gift. We are good at great schemes
and failed brilliance, and some eras seem to encourage this.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He wrote that in 1993, one year before Linux hit v1.0 and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> was
born, and two years before the Net as we know it today (graphical browsers,
ISPs, Amazon, Craigslist, cookies) came together
(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/flashback-this-was-the-internet-in-1995-2013-4?op=1" target="_self">www.businessinsider.com/flashback-this-was-the-internet-in-1995-2013-4?op=1</a>).
Since then, great schemes
and failed brilliance have been running non-stop in the technology world, even
through bust cycles. And, with too few exceptions (for example, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>), guys have run the show.
</p><p>
It's easy to see this as a matter of leadership. In &ldquo;Silicon Valley Has a
Code Name for Sexism &amp; Racism&rdquo;
(<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2013/10/07/vivek-wadhwa-a-code-name-for-sexism-and-racism" target="_self">blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2013/10/07/vivek-wadhwa-a-code-name-for-sexism-and-racism</a>),
Vivek Wadhwa (<a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/vivek-wadhwa" target="_self">blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/vivek-wadhwa</a>) says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...with a couple of notable exceptions, women are rarely found in the
executive ranks of tech companies. The Valley's echo chamber&mdash;what I
call the &ldquo;mafia&rdquo;&mdash;is oblivious to criticism about this. It doesn't seem
to care about the imbalance. Note the Twitter IPO filing. It shows that
all of its board members are male, as are all of its executives&mdash;other
than one lawyer whom the company added a few weeks ago&mdash;and all of its
investors.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
After digressing into an exchange of insults with Twitter CEO (and former
comic) Dick Costolo, Vivek gets down to business:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This exclusionary behavior is also harmful to companies and their
shareholders. To start with, having women on boards produces better
outcomes. Research by analyst firm Catalyst shows that companies with the
highest proportions of women board directors outperform those with the
lowest proportions by 53%
(<a href="http://www.catalyst.org/media/companies-more-women-board-directors-experience-higher-financial-performance-according-latest" target="_self">www.catalyst.org/media/companies-more-women-board-directors-experience-higher-financial-performance-according-latest</a>). They have a 42% higher return on sales and 66%
higher return on invested capital. When it comes to entrepreneurship, the
advantages of diversity become even clearer.
</p><p>
Firms founded by women are more capital efficient than those founded by
men
(<a href="http://www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/sources-of-financing-for-new-technology-firms-a-comparison-by-gender.aspx" target="_self">www.kauffman.org/research-and-policy/sources-of-financing-for-new-technology-firms-a-comparison-by-gender.aspx</a>).
Women-led high-tech startups have lower failure rates
(<a href="http://www.gemconsortium.org/docs/download/2409" target="_self">www.gemconsortium.org/docs/download/2409</a>). Venture-backed
companies run by a woman have annual revenues 12% higher than those by men
(<a href="http://www.illuminate.com/whitepaper" target="_self">www.illuminate.com/whitepaper</a>);
and organizations that are the most inclusive of women in top management
positions achieve a 35% higher return on equity and 34% higher total return
to shareholders.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I don't doubt that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> would be long gone today without women
running the magazine. That's not a knock on men (or on our founder, Phil
Hughes, who remains a leader in spirit). It's just that women, on the
whole, are better at running business, which lives to serve customers.
Guys,
on the whole, see business as a the grown-up version of what they learned
in back yards as boys.
</p><p>
Case in point. A few years back, when Guy Kawasaki was running Garage
Technology Ventures (<a href="http://www.garage.com" target="_self">www.garage.com</a>), he said he liked to vet start-up business plans with
women first, because men tend to talk in those plans about how their new
company will kill other companies. Women, he said, know that killing other
companies is not what makes a business succeed&mdash;or what customers
want. If, as John Gray (<a href="http://www.marsvenus.com" target="_self">www.marsvenus.com</a>) famously
put it, &ldquo;men are from Mars and women are
from Venus&rdquo; (the title of his bestseller,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Men-Mars-Women-Venus-Understanding/dp/0060574216" target="_self">www.amazon.com/Men-Mars-Women-Venus-Understanding/dp/0060574216</a>), our planet needs a mass
migration of Venusian immigrants.
</p><p>
Focusing on founders and CEOs isn't a bad thing, but focusing on the tops
of pyramids misses the depth and scale of the problem. Mars needs more
programmers, more engineers, more scientists, more mathematicians, more
hackers of all kinds. When I look in the LKML (<a href="https://lkml.org" target="_self">https://lkml.org</a>) for lists of contributors to
Linux (<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/6/148" target="_self">https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/10/6/148</a>), I tend to see something that looks like our subscriber role:
all-male or damn close. We have a long way to go.
</p><p>
This is a known issue, and well-documented on the prescriptive side,
starting with Val Henson's &ldquo;HOWTO Encourage Women in Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO" target="_self">tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO</a>), at The Linux
Documentation Project (<a href="http://www.tldp.org" target="_self">www.tldp.org</a>). From the
&ldquo;About the Author&rdquo;
(<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO/x28.html#AEN66" target="_self">tldp.org/HOWTO/Encourage-Women-Linux-HOWTO/x28.html#AEN66</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

developer, an active member of LinuxChix (<a href="http://www.linuxchix.org" target="_self">www.linuxchix.org</a>) and female. Her interests include
operating systems research, women and computer science, and fine beer. Many
other women collaborated with her to produce this HOWTO, including Raven

</p></blockquote></div><p>
That the document was last revised on October 29, 2002&mdash;more than
eleven years ago&mdash;speaks volumes. So does the slow
pace of posting on the LinuxChix home page/blog and its mailing lists
(<a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/join-our-email-lists-or-read-archives.html" target="_self">www.linuxchix.org/join-our-email-lists-or-read-archives.html</a>), or
at least those I checked.
</p><p>
But I am encouraged to find a LinuxChix post from February 2013
titled &ldquo;Joseph Reagle on the gender gap in geek culture&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxchix.org/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-gender-gap-geek-culture.html" target="_self">www.linuxchix.org/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-gender-gap-geek-culture.html</a>).
Joseph (<a href="http://reagle.org/joseph" target="_self">reagle.org/joseph</a>) is a
colleague of mine at the Berkman Center (<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu</a>) and a wise dude who knows what he's
talking about. His book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Good Faith Collaboration: The Culture of
Wikipedia</em></span> (<a href="http://reagle.org/joseph/2010/gfc" target="_self">reagle.org/joseph/2010/gfc</a>), belongs in the Canon on Collaboration, should there ever be such
a thing. The post from last February leverages this text from Jerry
Brito's (<a href="http://jerrybrito.com" target="_self">jerrybrito.com</a>) &ldquo;Surprisingly
Free&rdquo;
(<a href="http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2" target="_self">surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
According to Reagle, only 1% of the free software community and 9% of
Wikipedia editors are female, which he sees as emblematic of structural
problems in the geek community. While he does not believe that being a geek
or a nerd is in any way synonymous with being a sexist, he concludes that
three things that he otherwise loves&mdash;geekiness, openness, and the
rhetoric and ideology of freedom&mdash;are part of the problem inasmuch as
they allow informal cliques to arise, dominate the discussion, and squeeze
out minority views. Reagle also comments on a unintentional androcentricity
he has observed even amongst free software community heroes, highlighting
the ways in which this behavior can be alienating to women and prevents
geek culture from growing beyond its traditional base.
</p><p>
Reagle prescribes a 3-step solution to sexism in geek culture: talking
about gender; challenging and expanding what it means to be a geek; and not
allowing the rhetoric of freedom to be used as an excuse for bad behavior.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So we're taking the first step here. Let's talk about it.
