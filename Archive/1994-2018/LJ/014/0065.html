    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x141f580.0x1517298"></a></h2></div></div><p>On March 15 and 16, 1995, the University
of Washington had its twenty-first annual Computer Fair in Seattle.
In 1973 it was called the Terminal Fair because, after all, people
couldn't afford computers back then. Now this has grown to an event
with around 16,000 attendees ranging from students to Boeing and
Microsoft engineers.
</p><p>SSC, publishers of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, has
had a booth at the fair for the past four years. In 1991 and 1992,
SSC's booth with Unix products was not very popular among attendees
compared to the other booths with mostly Windows and MS-DOS
products. In 1993, we saw increased interest in our booth. Last
year, in the Spring of 1994, we gave away several hundred free
copies of Issue 1 of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we talked
to hundreds of interested people about Linux.</p><p>This year, our booth was one of the most popular booths. One
SSC employee (biased, we admit) claimed that only one booth at the
show was more popular than SSC's booth, and that was the Starbucks
Espresso booth. (For those not familiar with Seattle's reputation,
it prides itself on the number of quality espresso stands and is
called &ldquo;latte-land&rdquo; by some. Allegedly, Seattle consumes more
coffee than any other city in the world, save Milan, Italy.)</p><p>This year, we gave out 4000 copies of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and had hundreds of people enter their business
cards in our drawing for an Essential Linux Pack. The winner of the
Pack was Don Herold of North Bend, Washington.</p><p>Common questions asked while in the booth were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>How big a machine do I need to run Linux? Most
people were surprised to find out machines much smaller than what
are needed to run MS-Windows will support Linux just fine.</p></li><li><p>Will Linux run my DOS or (MS-Windows) programs? Most
people were happy with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the first question and seemed to
settle for &ldquo;maybe sometime soon&rdquo; for the second part.</p></li><li><p>What does Linux cost? &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; was a surprising
answer for many. Handing them an SSC catalog that includes various
CD distributions, as well as instructions on where and how to get
Linux off the Internet, seemed to get people thinking that Linux
for free is a reality.</p></li><li><p>Does Linux run on a Mac? Not a really popular
question but when we explained to people that Mac programs can run
on Linux (with the addition of Executor) these people seemed very
surprised.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to the booth, Phil Hughes, publisher of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, spoke to a packed auditorium of
500 people. Phil's talk followed an IBM presentation on OS/2 Warp
which, while well-attended, was not a full house.</p><p>Phil abandoned the more traditional marketing-oriented talk
and, instead, presented a Question and Answer talk where he
supplied the questions. When asked the reason for this type of talk
he responded, &ldquo;Most people interested in Linux don't need a sales
pitch. They just want to know what it is and if it will do what
they need done. If it does, it will sell itself.&rdquo; The large crowd
at the <i  >Linux Journal</i> booth following the talk
indicated that Phil was right.</p><p>On Monday, March 20, the Seattle Linux Group met at SSC's
offices. Prompted by the publicity at the UW Computer Fair, 58
people attended, up from the more typical 15-25 people. One person
at the meeting told the group that he had not really been thinking
about Linux but after talking to us at the Fair, he purchased a CD
and installed it over the weekend. He was very pleased with the
results.</p></div></div>
