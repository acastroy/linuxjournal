    Linux International, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and WorkGroup
    Solutions have arranged for Linux to have a major presence there. But,
    there is a problem. We need help. This show is bigger than any of us.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ebd580.0x1fb5298"></a></h2></div></div><p>COMDEX/Fall is America's largest computer
trade show. It usually has 200,000 attendees, and worldwide is
second in size only to CeBit in Hanover, Germany. Traditionally,
COMDEX is largely for resellers of computer technology, and is the
show most often selected by major vendors for important product
announcements. Many successful products trace their early launch to
COMDEX Fall.
</p><p>Linux International, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and
WorkGroup Solutions have arranged for Linux to have a major
presence there. But, there is a problem. We need help. This show is
bigger than any of us.</p><p>We would appreciate it if any Linux enthusiasts going to
COMDEX, or living within driving distance of Las Vegas would
volunteer their help.</p><p>We need 3 things to pull this off:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Companies to take (and pay for) booths in the Linux
Showcase area on the show floor. Contact Richard Kazarian at
SoftBank, (617) 449-6600, and tell him that you want to be part of
the Linux Showcase. Also, please let me know that you are
participating. If you cannot take a booth, then become a corporate
sponsor for Linux International, (www.li.org for info) and bring
your literature to distribute in LI's booth. Better yet, volunteer
to help man LI's booth, and present LI and your product,
too.</p></li><li><p>Volunteers to submit papers for sessions they would
like to present in the conference track that is being planned. Any
subject is good, from &ldquo;My first experience with Linux&rdquo;, &ldquo;How my
company uses Linux&rdquo;, to technical subjects on the design of the
kernel, how to configure networking, etc. Virtually any subject is
fair game. Please do not be shy about suggesting subjects. The
range of people attending will be from people who have never heard
of Linux to some of the few experts that actually exist. Your name
and session information will be printed in the show conference
guide, possibly your picture published, and you can use this as an
impressive reference for any future resume, work or presentation
you do. Volunteering gets you free admission to all conference
sessions and the show floor, if your suggestion is accepted.
Unfortunately, we cannot pay for travel expenses for anyone.
</p><p>You may note that, of all things, OSW (Open Systems World, in
Washington D.C.) and COMDEX are the same week. For those people who
would like to be present at both shows and end up in Vegas for a
party weekend, Phil Hughes, publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and I are arranging sessions at OSW the first
part of the week, and at COMDEX the second half.</p></li><li><p>Volunteers are needed to help in Linux
International's booth, and possibly the booths of Linux Vendors who
request it. Also, volunteers are needed to hand out literature to
draw people to the Linux Showcase area. Volunteering gets you free
admission to the show floor where the vendors are.</p></li></ul></div><p>If this is handled well, this one event could serve to launch
Linux into commercial acceptance. Please help us make Linux known
as THE OS, and THE Revolution.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>For papers, offers of help, or questions, please
write to: Mark Bolzern at
<a href="mailto:shows@wgs.com">shows@wgs.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>For information on COMDEX/Fall in general, contact
Steve Engle or Richard Kazarian at SoftBank, (617) 449-6600, and
tell them how excited you are that COMDEX/Fall will have a
substantial Linux Focus, and that this is the reason you will
attend (if true).</p></li></ul></div><p>COMDEX/Fall will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, November
13-17, and it takes over the entire town. There are lots of
parties, free food, give-aways and fun for all. If you have never
been at COMDEX (everyone should do it at least once in their
lives), be warned&mdash;you are likely to run into any of the people
whose names you regularly see in print, from Gates to journalists.
You may even speak with them. See you there.</p></div></div>
