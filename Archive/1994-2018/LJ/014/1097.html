    Comtrol, Cyclades, DigiBoard, and Stallion boards are tested
    in <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s hardware review. If you need more serial
    ports than you currently have, read on.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x14193a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you are planning on supporting a
cluster of terminals, a modem pool for a BBS, a SLIP/PPP server, or
a UUCP site, you might find yourself quickly running out of serial
ports. Standard PC serial ports are limited to four ports, so
chances are if you need more than four ports you may be considering
buying multiport boards. There are many factors to consider when
adding multiport serial boards to your machine. As modems get
faster and faster, I/O throughput has become an increasingly
important factor. It's also important to consider CPU usage when
adding a large number of ports. As you add more ports, the host CPU
will have to spend more time doing serial I/O.
</p><p><a href="1097s2.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Baud vs. bps&rdquo;</a></p><p>There are two basic types of serial boards: &ldquo;UART-based&rdquo;
(Universal Asyncronous Receiver Transmitter) and &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;.
Standard PC serial boards (COM1-COM4) typically come with 8250 or
16450 UARTs with a one-byte transmit and receive FIFO (buffer), or
16550A UARTs with sixteen-byte transmit and receive FIFOs. Boards
such as the Boca 2016 and the AST Fourport use these types of UARTs
in a multiport board configuration.</p><p>Most of these types of boards are supported by the standard
Linux serial driver, since they all use the same types of UART and
I/O technique. Due to limited FIFO size, and the fact that all
character processing must be done by the host CPU, a UART-based
serial board might not be sufficient to provide the I/O power you
need, for example, to drive a high-speed modem bank.</p><p><a href="1097t1.jpg" target="_self">Table 1. Supported Multiport Serial
Cards</a></p><p>This is where the intelligent multiport serial boards are
useful. These boards have serial port controllers with larger FIFOs
and with some sort of &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;, such as RISC UARTs with some
character recognition and flow control logic. Some may even have a
CPU of their own to handle serial I/O. Since these boards vary in
chipsets and control logic, a driver must be written for each board
for use with Linux. With the old tty driver (which provides the
abstract, general handling for all terminal devices, including
serial, console, and pseudo-tty's), support for intelligent
multiport boards was nearly impossible.</p><p>In the 1.1 Linux development kernel, Ted Ts'o (the maintainer
of the serial driver and the tty driver) rewrote the generic tty
driver to allow support for many kinds of serial devices, improving
the serial drivers in the process. Since then, several drivers for
intelligent multiport boards have been written, and more are being
developed. In this issue, I'll be reviewing 8-port intelligent
serial boards supplied by four manufacturers: Comtrol, Cyclades,
Digi International, and Stallion Technologies. For vendor contact
information, please see the <a href="1097s1.html" target="_self">Vendor Contact
Information</a>. Now let's look at each board in detail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x14197c0"></a>Hardware Features</h2></div></div><p>The following 8-port serial boards were sent to me for
review. It should be noted that many other models of the boards,
with different port configurations and I/O capabilities, are
supported under Linux in addition to the ones I reviewed. A list of
supported boards can be found in table 1. In the Control Signals
column of table 1, MC stands for &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>RS232 modem
control</em></span>&rdquo; and HWC stands for full &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>RS232
hardware flow control</em></span>&rdquo;. In the Max speed column, all
figures are in bps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1419978"></a>Comtrol RocketPort RA 8</h2></div></div><p>The RocketPort RA (Remote Access) 8 series of boards features
two 36 MHz ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) with
256-byte transmit FIFOs and 1024-byte receive FIFOs for each port,
and built in flow control and line discipline handling. The ASICs
also handle other functions, such as the bus interface logic and
other miscellaneous logic, significantly reducing the number of
components on the board.</p><p>RocketPort RA 8 boards support full RS232D modem and hardware
flow control signals at speeds up to 230.4 Kbps. Four RocketPort RA
8 boards can be installed in one system. The first requires a 68
byte I/O address range, and each additional board requires a 64
byte I/O address range. I/O address ranges are selectable from
0x100, 0x140, 0x180, 0x200, 0x240, 0x280, 0x300, 0x340, 0x380 and
are set with a DIP switch. No IRQ is needed for any of the boards.
The driver comes in the form of a loadable module and is supported
by Comtrol. The RocketPort RA 8 series features the RocketPort RA
Octacable, which includes an octopus cable with DB25 connectors, at
US $499.00, and the RocketPort 8 RA, which includes a connector box
with DB25 connectors, is priced at US $678.00.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1419ad8"></a>Cyclades Cyclom-8Y</h2></div></div><p>The Cyclom-8Y series of boards features two 12.5 MHz Cirrus
Logic CD-1400 RISC UARTs. The CD-1400 UARTs handle flow control and
special character recognition and also have 12 byte transmit and
receive FIFOs, as well as a holding and shift register for each
port. The Cyclom-8Y boards support full RS232C modem control and
hardware flow control signals (except for the Cyclom-8Ys, which
have no RTS signal) and will support speeds up to 115.2 Kbps. Each
Cyclom-8Y board needs one interrupt (IRQ) selectable from 5, 9, 10,
11, 12, and 15, and an 8K block of dual-ported RAM selectable from
0xA0000-0xEE000. Both IRQ and I/O address are set with a DIP switch
on the board. Four boards can be used simultaneously, each
requiring its own IRQ and I/O address.</p><p>The driver for the Cyclom boards is included in kernel
sources starting with version 1.1.74 and newer. The Cyclom-8Y
boards are supported by Cyclades, which was the first company to
offer a vendor-supported driver for an intelligent multiport board
under Linux. There are four 8-port models in the Cyclom-8Y line:
the Cyclom-8Ys with on-board RJ12 connectors (no RTS signal), at US
$459.00; Cyclom-8Yo with an octopus cable with DB25 connectors,
priced at US $511.00; and the Cyclom-8Yb and Cyclom-8Yb+ with DB25
connectors in an external box (the Cyclom-8Yb+ also has surge
protection), at US $599.00 and US $699.00, respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1419c38"></a>DigiBoard PC/8e</h2></div></div><p>The DigiBoard PC/8e board is driven by an 12.5 MHz Intel
80186 CPU to handle I/O processing. It also uses 64K on-board RAM
for data buffering. Seven PC/8e boards can be used in one system,
each requiring one four-byte I/O address selectable from 0x100,
0x110, 0x120, 0x200, 0x220, 0x300, and 0x320 with a DIP switch. The
nice thing about this board is that the DIP switch is located on
the back of the card, so you can see and change the I/O address
without opening your computer. An 8K block of dual-ported RAM is
also required, but this can be shared among all boards. This
address is selectable from 0xC0000-0xEFFFF by the PC/8e driver. No
IRQ is required.</p><p>PC/8e boards support RS232C full modem and hardware flow
control signals at speeds up to 115.2 Kbps. The driver for this
board is supported by Troy De Jongh (an employee of DigiBoard), not
by DigiBoard. The PC/8e host adaptor is US $795.00 plus US $90.00
for a DB25 connector octopus cable, US $110.00 for a DB25 connector
box, or US $110.00 for an RJ45 connector box.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1419d98"></a>Stallion EasyIO/8, and EasyConnection
8/32</h2></div></div><p>Stallion boards employ the same CD-1400 RISC UARTs as the
Cyclades boards, with the same features. There are two models of
the Stallion 8-port boards: the EasyIO/8, and the EasyConnection
8/32 modular board. Both boards need an 8 byte I/O address,
selectable from 0x200-0x3FF with a DIP switch, and an IRQ
selectable from 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 15, with the driver. The
IRQ can be shared by all boards on an EISA bus machine. The
EasyConnection 8/32 board needs an additional 32-byte secondary I/O
address, selectable from 0x200-0x3FF via the driver, also sharable
among all EasyConnection 8/32 boards. Any combination of four
EasyIO/8 and EasyConnection 8/32 boards are supported by the
driver.</p><p>EasyIO/8 boards offer 8 RS232C serial ports at speeds up to
115.2 Kbps, with full modem and hardware flow control.
EasyConnection 8/32 boards offer 8-32 ports supporting RS232D full
modem and hardware flow control signals at speeds up to 115.2 Kbps
and, optionally, RS422A signals, also at 115.2 Kbps. The
EasyConnection 8/32 is offered with 8 or 16 port modules, which can
be used in any combination together to form a 32 port module. Each
module has its own CD-1400 chips to support the ports on that
module. The modules are nicely made and also have wall mount
brackets on the back. The driver for this series of boards is
supported by Greg Ungerer (an employee of Stallion), not by
Stallion. The EasyIO/8 is available with a DB25 connector octopus
cable, or an RJ45 connector box for US $595.00. The EasyConnection
8/32 host adaptor is US $300.00. Eight-port modules are priced at
US $595 for RS232 connector boxes with RJ45 or DB25 connectors, and
US $795.00 for a RS232/RS422 DB25 connector box. Sixteen-port
modules with RJ45 connectors cost US $845.00, and 16-port modules
with DB25 connectors are US $945.00.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1419ef8"></a>Common Features</h2></div></div><p>Several common features were shared among all
products:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>All manufacturers offers five-year warranties and
30-day money-back guarantees.</p></li><li><p>The ISA/EISA buses are the only bus types
supported, although support for PCI cards is in progress by some
vendors.</p></li><li><p>Everyone was extremely helpful; even the people who
support the driver in their spare time were very responsive.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x141a268"></a>Usability Testing</h2></div></div><p>All boards were installed and worked flawlessly following the
documentation that was included with the drivers. Each board was
used in my system for over a week, supporting my UUCP feed. I also
did testing with interactive login sessions, file transfers, and
dialup PPP connections with my V.34 modem. No problems were
encountered with any of the boards during this usability testing
phase. Dumb terminals were simulated by interconnecting cables on
the serial boards. Again, no problems were encountered.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x141a370"></a>Performance Benchmarks</h2></div></div><p>Unfortunately, benchmarking is a necessary evil for hardware
reviews. You just can't judge hardware by its looks, no matter how
pretty it is.</p><p>Benchmarking is somewhat of a black art. It is possible to
tweak benchmarks to produce very biased test results to highlight
particular features of a product. I have no connection to any
vendors, so my tests are not biased by personal or professional
concerns. Also, some benchmarks (such as the ones I did) don't
exactly portray real-world situations, but they do provide some
sort of performance measurement.</p><p><a href="1097t2.jpg" target="_self">Table 2. Performance</a></p><p>Because of resource limits, I was simply unable to acquire
the massive amount of equipment needed to accurately simulate, for
example, 8 dialup PPP connections. This would have required 9
computers, 16 high speed modems, 8 phone lines (or another way of
connecting the modems), and^well, you get the idea. So, keep all
this in mind while reading these benchmarks, and take them with a
grain or two of salt.</p><p>The most interesting statistics are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>I/O
throughput</b></span>--how many characters are sent and
received;</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>CPU overhead</b></span>--how
much of the host CPU is consumed doing the I/O. Only system time is
counted, not user time, because it is the efficiency of the kernel
driver and hardware that is being measured.</p></li></ul></div><p>The ideal board gives the highest throughput with the lowest
CPU usage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x141a8f0"></a>Testing Platform</h2></div></div><p>All tests were done on a generic PC, with an Intel 486DX33
CPU and 256K cache, 16MB RAM, and an ISA bus, running Linux 1.2.0.
Benchmark tests were done in single user mode, with a minimally
configured kernel, to ensure that other program activity would not
skew the test results.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x141a9f8"></a>Benchmarking Software</h2></div></div><p>The software I used is called
<span   class="bold"><b>tbench</b></span>. It was developed by
engineers at DigiBoard, with enhancements made by engineers at
Stallion. I consider the benchmarking software to be reasonably
unbiased, due to the fact that it was developed by two competitors,
and the fact that it is used by yet other competitors (such as
Comtrol) indicates that they concur. Further modifications were
made by Stallion engineers for Linux, to adapt the software to use
<span   class="bold"><b>setserial</b></span> in order to use higher
speeds with the serial ports. The tbench software is in the public
domain.</p><p>You can get the version of tbench I used at
ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/people/gregh/review, along with the
full test results. The original version of tbench is available at
ftp://ftp.digibd.com/pub/tbench.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x141ac08"></a>Output Tests</h2></div></div><p>The tbench output tests write data to combinations of ports
ranging from one port to all 8 ports. The data is written to the
output port set as fast as possible, without flow control, to
provide a steady stream of data. The data consists of six-digit
numbers with checksums. 100K of data is written to each port. Each
output test was run three times, and the results were averaged to
eliminate any inconsistencies.</p><p>There are two sets of test results: &ldquo;raw&rdquo;
(<b  >-opost</b>) and &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; (<b  >opost</b>)
I/O results. It's important to distinguish which types of activity
uses which type of I/O mode. Interactive login sessions use cooked
mode for I/O, while programs such as file transfer programs, SLIP,
PPP, and UUCP do raw I/O. Cooked I/O is slower, because each
character must be examined to see if it's a special character, such
as <b  >^C</b> or <b  >^Z</b>. In addition,
some editing of the line is done. Of course, this takes more CPU
overhead. In raw I/O mode, there is no need to examine each
character, because all 8-bit combinations are considered to be
valid data, and no characters are specially processed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411758"></a>Output Test Results</h2></div></div><p>Under ideal conditions, the actual character per second (CPS)
output will be the serial port speed divided by ten. Each character
transmitted is 8 bits plus a start and stop bit, hence we device
the speed by ten. Output tests were done at 9600, 38400, 57600 and
115200 bps, each in both raw and cooked mode. The raw output data
was compiled into graphs for each speed, showing the CPS throughput
on one to 8 ports and the CPU usage on one to 8 ports (see page
50).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411860"></a>Comtrol RocketPort RA 8</h2></div></div><p>This board truly lives up to its name. The RocketPort gave a
very solid performance across all ports and at all speeds, even at
115.2 Kbps. CPU usage in raw and cooked mode were the lowest of all
boards, except at 115.2 Kbps (where the throughput was still the
highest). Throughput ranked near the top at all speeds, sometimes
getting slightly less than the Stallion board, and was the absolute
best by a margin of 500-1100 CPS at 115.2 Kbps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411968"></a>Cyclades Cyclom-8Yo</h2></div></div><p>The Cyclom-8Yo gave a somewhat lower performance than the
equally-equipped Stallion board. The throughput was nearly always
lower, and the CPU usage nearly always higher, compared to the
competitors, except at 115.2 Kbps in cooked mode, where the Cyclom
bested all boards in CPU usage (but not in throughput) at a
surprisingly low 44%. A new version of the driver has been
released, in which the CPU handling is improved, but we were unable
to test it in time for publication. Throughput also varied
irregularly with different port configurations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411a70"></a>DigiBoard PC/8e</h2></div></div><p>The performance of this board was poor at high speeds. CPS
throughput was acceptable at 9600 bps, and at 38400 bps in raw
mode. At 38400 bps in cooked mode, throughput degraded quickly as
more ports were tested. However, Digi does state in their sales
literature that 38400 bps is the maximum usage rate for an 8 port
board (even though you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> run the rate up to
115.2 Kbps) so the results weren't all that surprising. At all
speeds, the CPU usage in cooked mode was unusually high, and at
high speeds, the board ground the CPU to a screeching halt. In raw
mode, CPU usage was actually quite good, but the throughput
degraded to unacceptable levels at speeds greater than 38400
bps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411bd0"></a>Stallion EasyIO/8</h2></div></div><p>Because of the design similarity of the EasyIO/8 and
EasyConnection 8/32, and the fact that my tests on the EasyIO/8
were very close to similar tests done by the driver's developer on
an EasyConnection 8/32, the EasyConnection 8/32 was not
benchmarked. It is reasonable to assume that results for both
boards will be nearly identical in an 8 port configuration.</p><p>Overall, the EasyIO/8 did quite well. Throughput at 9600,
38400 and 57600 bps was comparable to the Comtrol RocketPort,
sometimes winning by a slight margin. Even at 115.2 Kbps, the board
performed quite well in throughput, although CPU usages were higher
than the RocketPort's at all speeds. Compared to the Cyclades
board, which uses the same UART technology, the EasyIO/8 did higher
throughput and generally used less CPU time, except at 115.2 Kbps.
The driver must be amazingly tuned to get such high throughput with
12 byte FIFOs. CPS throughput did begin to vary slightly at 115.2
Kbps, but remained steady at other speeds.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411d30"></a>Input Tests</h2></div></div><p>Input tests are much harder to do than output tests. Output
tests only require one computer, and it's not even necessary to
connect any cables. To do input tests properly, you need more
equipment. Two computers are needed, each equally equipped and each
with the same serial board, of course. These two systems must then
be cabled together. One system is then designated as the &ldquo;producer&rdquo;
system and outputs data, while the other system is designated the
&ldquo;consumer&rdquo; system and inputs data.</p><p>Unfortunately, we lacked sufficient resources to do a good
job at this, and so the input tests that were run do not give a
worthwhile and reliable indication of the cards' capabilities. We
do not want to give questionable test results due to
less-than-ideal test conditions, so input test results are not
reported here. In future reviews, perhaps we will be able to do
meaningful input tests; please tell us if you would find this
useful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x1411e90"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>1) How much performance do you get for your money?</p><p>Throughput and CPU usage are important statistics to
consider, besides the price. The Comtrol RocketPort RA boards are
hard to beat, both in price and performance. They have the lowest
price if you buy the octopus cable version of the board and offer
the best overall performance. However, using the connector box
makes the RocketPort less price-competitive. The Stallion boards
are not bad performance-wise, but the EasyIO/8 is slightly more
expensive than the Cyclades and Comtrol boards. The EasyConnection
8/32 is also slightly more expensive, but is a modular board, so
the higher price is to be expected. Cyclades boards are quite
competitive in the price ranges and are consistently lower-priced
than the similar Stallion, but their performance is also slightly
lower. The DigiBoard PC/8e is expensive, and performed poorly in
our tests. We can only recommend using this board if you have
already purchased it.</p><p>2) Who supports the driver?</p><p>And who can you call when it won't work and you've tried
everything? If you are worried about having someone that absolutely
has to listen to and fix your problem, then Comtrol and Cyclades
have what you need. Cyclades has been backing their Linux drivers
for their Cyclom line of boards for almost a year now, and Comtrol
is very eager to support their hardware under Linux. In fact, while
doing my benchmarking with the Comtrol driver, I discovered a
serious performance problem at high speeds. After I contacted the
Comtrol engineer with my problem, he immediately began to examine
the driver code and confirmed my suspicions. Later that afternoon,
he found the driver problem. I had a fixed version of the driver by
the next day.</p><p>Even though the other engineers and sales personnel at Digi
and Stallion were very helpful, there is no substitute for
technical support backed by the vendor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1321580.0x14120f8"></a>Resoures</h2></div></div><p>General information on setting up serial devices, such as
