Linux which hasn't been fully quenched by a book...until O'Reilly
&amp; Associates got together with Lar Kaufman and Matt Welsh, the
Coordinator of the Linux Documentation Project and the author of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation &amp; Getting Started</em></span>, to
take on this project. Unostentatiously titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span>, this book is a perfect blend of polished
knowledge, organized in an easy-to-grasp package, like most books
in the O'Reilly line.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> covers everything you need
to install, use and understand the Linux operating system. This
cornucopia includes in-depth installation and configuration
instructions, tutorial and discussion of programming tools for
system and program development, information on system maintenance,
network administration guidelines, and everything in between. The
book opens with an explanation of the GNU General Public License
and some background concepts. It also includes a brief history of
the Linux system; starting with the UNIX operating system that was
the inspiration for Linux, then covering its creation by Linus
Torvalds in 1991, on to the present day&mdash;or pretty close.</p><p>Continuing on, you'll find a comprehensive installation
tutorial that leads you step-by-step through the tedious task of
setting up and configuring Linux on your PC, independent of which
distribution you decide to use (although some examples from the
Slackware distribution are given). All the basic concepts relevant
to installation are discussed here, and solutions to many common
problems are presented.</p><p>Next is a presentation of basic UNIX concepts, most of which
are not unique to Linux, but which you need to know to take
advantage of Linux. You don't want to drive a fancy, powerful
operating system without knowing how to shift and steer it. This
chapter teaches you how to shift, steer, stop, and even read maps
and road signs.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> also provides complete
information on Linux system and network administration. Basic
functions such as repairing file systems, installing software, and
administering user accounts are made easy. More advanced features
such as UUCP, TCP/IP, e-mail, SLIP, PPP, and other serial
telecommunications are also discussed. You are even shown how to
provide network services from your Linux machine. This includes a
section on configuring your very own World Wide Web (WWW) server
and writing HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) documents for the
WWW.</p><p>The programming languages and other system tools features in
Linux are thoroughly described in both theory and practice. Among
these tools are the gcc C and C++ compiler, the gdb debugger, perl,
Tcl and the Tk toolkit, the Emacs and vi editors, text formatting
systems such as TeX and tools designed to interface with
MS-DOS.</p><p>Lastly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> offers helpful
installation and configuration information to make setting up
XFree86 a bit easier. This project alone has been known to cause
rashes and other stress-induced ailments, but reading the
keep-it-simple approach in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> can
help keep you healthy...</p><p>In short, this book answers the questions the novice users
are too afraid to ask, and the questions gurus won't admit they
don't know.</p></div></div>
