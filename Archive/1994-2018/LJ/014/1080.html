    Our Kernel Korner series continues with an article
    describing the linux Keyboard driver. This artilce is not
    for &ldquo;Kernel Hackers&rdquo; only&mdash;in fact, it will be most useful
    to those who wish to use their own keyboard to its fullest
    potential, and those who want to write programs to take
    advantage of the many features in the Linux keyboard driver.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e9580.0x25e1450"></a></h2></div></div><p>When you press a key on the console
keyboard, the corresponding character is not simply added to the
<span   class="bold"><b>tty</b></span> (generic terminal handling)
input buffers as if it had come in over a serial port. A lot of
processing is required before the kernel knows what the correct
characters are. Only after processing can the generic tty code,
which handles all interactive terminal devices, take over.
</p><p>Roughly speaking, the picture is this: the keyboard produces
scancodes, the scancodes are assembled into keycodes (one unique
code for each key), and keycodes are converted to tty input
characters using the kernel keymaps. After that, the normal `stty'
processing takes place, just as for any other terminal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e9580.0x25e1608"></a>Scancodes First</h2></div></div><p>The usual PC keyboards are capable of producing three sets of
scancodes. Writing 0xf0 followed by 1, 2 or 3 to port 0x60 will put
the keyboard in scancode mode 1, 2 or 3. Writing 0xf0 followed by 0
queries the mode, resulting in a scancode byte 0x43, 0x41 or 0x3f
from the keyboard. (Don't try this at home, kids. If you are not
very careful, you will end up in a situation where rebooting is the
only way out&mdash;and control-alt-delete will not be available to shut
the computer down correctly. See the accompanying
<a href="1080l1.html" target="_self">listing of kbd_cmd.c</a> for
details.)</p><p>Scancode mode 2 is the default. In this mode, a key press
usually produces a value s in the range 0x01-0x5f and the
corresponding key release produces s+0x80. In scancode mode 3, the
only key releases that produce a scan code are of both Shift keys,
and the left Ctrl and Alt keys; for all other keys only the key
presses are noted. The produced scancodes are mostly equal to those
for scancode mode 2.</p><p>In scancode mode 1 most key releases produce the same values
as in scancode mode 2, but for key presses there are entirely
different, unrelated values. The details are somewhat messy.</p><p>A program can request the raw scancodes by</p><pre     class="programlisting">

ioctl(0, KDSKBMODE, K_RAW);
</pre><p>For example, <span   class="bold"><b>X</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dosemu</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>svgadoom</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>showkey -s</b></span> do this. The default
keycode translation mode is restored by</p><pre     class="programlisting">

ioctl(0, KDSKBMODE, K_XLATE);
</pre><p>See the keyboard FAQ (in kbd-0.90.tar.gz) for some advice
about how to get out of raw scancode mode from the shell prompt.
(At a shell prompt the commands <b  >kbd_mode
[-s|-k|-a|-u]</b> will set the keyboard mode to scancode
mode, keycode mode, translation (`ASCII') mode and Unicode mode,
respectively. But it is difficult to type this command when the
keyboard is in raw scancode mode.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e9580.0x25e1b88"></a>Scancodes to Keycodes</h2></div></div><p>Life would have been easy had there been a 1-1 correspondence
between keys and scancodes. (And in fact there is, in scancode mode
3, but that does not suffice for Linux, since X requires both the
key press and the key release events.)</p><p>But as it is, a single key press can produce a sequence of up
to six scancodes, and the kernel has to parse the stream of
scancodes and convert it into a series of key press and key release
events. To this end, each key is provided with a unique keycode k
in the range 1-127, and pressing key k produces keycode k, while
releasing it produces keycode k+128. The assignment of key codes is
in principle arbitrary (and has no relation to the key codes used
by X), but at present the key code equals the scan code for those
keys that produce a single scancode in the range 0x01-0x58.</p><p>The parsing works by</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>recognizing the special sequence 0xe1 0x1d 0x45
0xe1 0x9d 0xc5 produced by the Pause key</p></li><li><p>throwing out any fake Shift-down and Shift-up
codes, inserted by the keyboard to make the kernel believe that you
pressed Shift to undo the effect of NumLock</p></li><li><p>recognizing scancode pairs 0xe0 s</p></li><li><p>recognizing single scancodes s.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since s can take 127 values (0 is a keyboard error condition,
and the high order bit indicates press/release) this means that
parsing could result in 1+127+126=254 distinct keycodes. However,
at present keycodes are restricted to the range 1-127 and we have
to work a little to make things fit. (No doubt sooner or later
keycodes will be integers instead of 7-bit quantities, and the
keymaps will be sparse, but for the time being we can avoid
that&mdash;since to my knowledge no actual PC keyboard has more than 127
keys.) So, there are small tables that assign a keycode to a
scancode pair 0xe0 s or to a single scancode in the range
0x59-0x7f. In the default setting everything works for most current
keyboards, but in case you have some strange keyboard, you can get
the kernel to recognize an otherwise unrecognized key by filling an
entry in these tables using the KDSETKEYCODE ioctl; see
setkeycodes(8).</p><p>Two keys are unusual in the sense that their keycode is not
constant, but depends on modifiers. The PrintScrn key will yield
keycode 84 when combined with either Alt key, but keycode 99
otherwise. The Pause key will yield keycode 101 when combined with
either Ctrl key, but keycode 119 otherwise. (This has historic
reasons, but might change, to free keycodes 99 and 119 for other
purposes.)</p><p>At present there is no way to tell X about strange
key(board)s. The easiest solution would be to make X use keycodes
instead of scancodes, so that the information about strange keys
and the scancodes they produce is located a single place.</p><p>A program can request to get keycodes by doing</p><pre     class="programlisting">

ioctl(0, KDSKBMODE,
K_MEDIUMRAW);
</pre><p>For example, showkey does this. Warning: the details of the
function of both the <b  >KDSETKEYCODE</b> ioctl and the
<b  >K_MEDIUMRAW</b> keyboard mode are likely to change
in the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e9580.0x25e2318"></a>Keymaps</h2></div></div><p>Keycodes are converted to keysymbols by looking them up on
the appropriate keymap. There are eight possible modifiers (shift
keys), and the combination of currently active modifiers and locks
determines the keymap used.</p><p>Thus, what happens is approximately:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

int shift_final = shift_state ^ kbd-&gt;lockstate;
 ushort *key_map = key_maps[shift_final];
 keysym = key_map[keycode];
</pre><p>The eight modifiers are known as Shift, AltGr, Control, Alt,
ShiftL, ShiftR, CtrlL and CtrlR. These labels have no intrinsic
meaning, and the modifiers can be used for arbitrary purposes,
except that the keymap for the Shift modifier determines the action
of CapsLock (and that the Shift key partially suppresses keyboard
application mode). By default Shift is bound to both Shift keys and
Control keys and Alt and AltGr are bound to the left and right Alt
keys. The remaining four modifiers are unbound in the default
kernel. X is able to distinguish ShiftL and ShiftR, etc.</p><p>Thus, there are 256 possible keymaps&mdash;for plain symbols, for
Shift+symbol, for Ctrl+AltL+Shift+symbol, etc. Usually, not all of
the keymaps will be allocated (combinations with more than three
modifiers are rather unusual), and in fact the default kernel
allocates only 7 keymaps, namely the plain, Shift, AltR, Ctrl,
Ctrl+Shift, AltL and Ctrl+AltL maps. You can allocate more keymaps
simply by filling some of their entries using
<span   class="bold"><b>loadkeys(1)</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e9580.0x25e25d8"></a>Key # symbols</h2></div></div><p>Key symbols are <b  >shorts</b>, i.e., they consist
of two bytes. In Unicode mode, this short is just the 16-bit value
returned&mdash;or, to be precise, the returned byte string is the UTF-8
representation of this Unicode character. The keyboard is put into
Unicode mode by</p><pre     class="programlisting">

ioctl(0, KDSKBMODE, K_UNICODE);
</pre><p>When not in Unicode mode, the high order byte is viewed as a
type, and the low order byte as a value, and we do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

type = KTYP(keysym);
 (*key_handler[type])(keysym &amp; 0xff, up_flag);
</pre><p>The type selects a function from the array
key_handler:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

static k_hand key_handler[16] = {
     do_self, do_fn, do_spec, do_pad, do_dead,
     do_cons, do_cur, do_shift, do_meta, do_ascii,
     do_lock, do_lowercase, do_ignore, do_ignore,
     do_ignore, do_ignore
 };
</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b  >do_self</b>, commonly used for
ordinary keys, just returns the given value, after possibly
handling pending dead diacriticals.</p></li><li><p><b  >do_fn</b>, commonly used for
function keys, returns the string
<b  >func_table[value]</b>. Strings can be assigned using
loadkeys(1).</p></li><li><p><b  >do_spec</b> is used for special
actions, not necessarily related to character input. It does
<b  >spec_fn_table[value]();</b>, where</p><pre     class="programlisting">

static void_fnp spec_fn_table[] = {
do_null, enter, show_ptregs, show_mem,
show_state, send_intr, lastcons, caps_toggle,
num, hold, scroll_forw, scroll_back, boot_it,
caps_on, compose, SAK, decr_console,
incr_console, spawn_console, bare_num
 };
</pre><p>The associated actions (and their default key binding)
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Return (Enter): return a <b  >CR</b> and
if <b  >VC_CRLF</b> mode set also a
<b  >LF</b>. One sets/clears <b  >CRLF</b> mode
by sending <b  >ESC [ 20 h</b> or <b  >ESC [ 20
l</b> to the console.</p></li><li><p>Show_Registers (AltR-ScrollLock): print the
contents of the CPU registers.</p></li><li><p>Show_Memory (Shift-ScrollLock): print current
memory usage.</p></li><li><p>Show_State (Ctrl-ScrollLock): print the process
tree.</p></li><li><p>Break (Ctrl-Break): send a Break to the current
tty.</p></li><li><p>Last_Console (Alt-PrintScrn): switch to the last
used console.</p></li><li><p>Caps_Lock (CapsLock): toggle the CapsLock
setting.</p></li><li><p>Num_Lock (NumLock): in keyboard application mode:
return <b  >ESC O P</b>; otherwise, toggle the NumLock
setting. One sets/clears keyboard application mode by sending
<b  >ESC = or ESC &gt;</b> to the console. (See also
Bare_Num_Lock below.)</p></li><li><p>Scroll_Lock (ScrollLock): stop/start tty&mdash;roughly
equivalent to <b  >^S/^Q</b>.</p></li><li><p>Scroll_Forward (Shift-PageDown): scroll console
down.</p></li><li><p>Scroll_Backward (Shift-PageUp): scroll console up.
These two functions are implemented by using the memory on the
video card, and provide only a very limited scrollback facility.
Moreover, all scrollback information is lost when you switch
virtual consoles. So, for real scrollback use a program-like
screen.</p></li><li><p>Boot (Ctrl-AltL-Del): reboot. If you press
Ctrl-AltL-Del (or whatever key was assigned the keysym Boot by
loadkeys) then either the machine reboots immediately (without
sync), or <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> is sent a
<b  >SIGINT</b>. The former behavior is the default. The
default can be changed by root, using the system call
<span   class="bold"><b>reboot():</b></span> see
<span   class="bold"><b>ctrlaltdel(8)</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>init(8)</b></span>.
</p><p>Some versions of init change the default. What happens when
init gets SIGINT depends on the version of init used&mdash;often it will
be determined by the pf (stands for powerfail) entry in
/etc/inittab, which means that you can run an arbitrary program. In
the current kernel, Ctrl-AltR-Del is no longer by default assigned
to Boot, only Ctrl-AltL-Del is.</p><p>Sometimes when init hangs in a disk wait (and syncing is
impossible) it can be useful to say ctrlaltdel hard, which may
allow you to force a reboot without power cycling or pressing the
reset button.</p></li><li><p>aps_On (none): set CapsLock.</p></li><li><p>ompose (Ctrl-.): start a compose sequence. The two
following characters will be combined. This is a good way to get
accented characters that you only rarely need. For example,
<b  >Ctrl-.&gt;&lt;,&gt;&lt;c</b> will produce a
c-cedilla, and <b  >Ctrl-.&amp;gt:&lt;a&gt;&lt;e</b> the
Danish letter &aelig;. Precisely which combinations combine to what
character; will show <span   class="bold"><b>dumpkeys(1)</b></span>,
loadkeys(1) will set combinations.</p></li><li><p>SAK (none): Secure Attention Key. This is supposed
to kill all processes related to the current tty, and reset the tty
to a known default state. It is not completely implemented&mdash;it is
not quite clear what resetting the keyboard/console should do to
the fonts and keymaps. The easiest solution is to send a signal to
some trusted daemon, and let it reset keyboard and console as
desired. In this way we obtain something closely related to the
Spawn_Console function below.</p></li><li><p>Decr_Console (AltL-LeftArrow): switch to the
virtual console that precedes the current console in the cyclic
order.</p></li><li><p>Incr_Console (AltL-RightArrow): switch to the
virtual console that follows the current console in the cyclic
order.</p></li><li><p>Spawn_Console or KeyboardSignal (AltL-UpArrow):
send a specified process a specified signal. I use this to signal
init that it should create a fresh virtual console for me.</p></li><li><p>Bare_Num_Lock (Shift-NumLock): toggle the NumLock
setting (regardless of keyboard application mode).</p></li></ul></div><p>As long as no new releases of init and loadkeys have come
out, you can play with this by using loadkeys and starting the
program <a href="1080l2.html" target="_self">spawn_console</a>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

% loadkeys &gt;&gt; EOF
 alt keycode 103 = 0x0212
 EOF
 % spawn_console &amp;
</pre><p>Of course, if you put this in /etc/rc.local, you would
probably want to start <span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span>
instead of <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>.</p></li><li><p><b  >do_pad</b>, commonly used for the
keypad keys. In keyboard application mode this produces some
three-character string <b  >ESC O X</b> (with variable X
depending on the key), provided that Shift is not pressed
simultaneously. Otherwise, when NumLock is on, we get the symbol
printed on the key (0123456789.+ -/* and CR).
</p><p>Finally, if NumLock is not on, the four arrow keys yield
<b  >ESC [ X</b> (with <b  >X=A</b>,
<b  >B</b>, <b  >C</b>, or
<b  >D</b>p when not in cursor key mode, and ESC O X
otherwise, while the remaining keys are treated as function keys,
and yield the associated string. For the middle key (keypad-5) we
find four possibilities:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>in keyboard application mode (unshifted), ESC O
u</p></li><li><p>in keyboard application mode, shifted, without
NumLock, ESC O G</p></li><li><p>otherwise, without NumLock, ESC [ G</p></li><li><p>but with NumLock, 5.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you think this is unnecessarily complicated, I agree. It
is a messy combination of VT100 and DOS keyboard behavior. However,
so far suggestions for change have met with too much
resistance.</p></li><li><p><b  >do_dead</b> is used for &ldquo;dead keys&rdquo;
that provide the following key with a diacritical. By default there
are no dead keys. One may define keys producing a dead grave,
acute, circumflex, tilde, or diaeresis. How a dead key combines
with a following key is specified using the compose mechanism
discussed above.</p></li><li><p><b  >do_cons</b> is used for switching
consoles. By default the combinations
(Ctrl-)AltL-F<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> switch to virtual console
<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> for <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> in the range
1-12, and AltR-Fn switches to console <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>+12 for
these same <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>.</p></li><li><p><b  >do_cur</b> handles cursor keys. One
gets either <b  >ESC [ X</b> or <b  >ESC O
X</b> (with <span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> one of <b  >A, B,
C</b>, or <b  >D</b>) depending on the cursor key
mode. (One sets or clears cursor key mode by sending <b  >ESC [
? 1 h</b> or <b  >ESC [ ? 1 l</b> to the
console.)</p></li><li><p><b  >do_shift</b> maintains the shift
state (the up/down state of the modifier keys).</p></li><li><p><b  >do_meta</b> is commonly used for
ordinary keys combined with AltL. If the keyboard is in metamode,
this will yield a pair <b  >ESC x</b>; otherwise
<b  >x | 0x80</b> is produced, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is the key pressed in both cases. (You can
set or clear metamode using the tiny utility
<span   class="bold"><b>setmetamode(1)</b></span>.)</p></li><li><p><b  >do_ascii</b> is used to construct
given codes: press AltL, type a decimal code on the keypad, and
release AltL. This yields the character with the given code. In
Unicode mode the same works in hexadecimal: press AltR, type a
hexadecimal code on the keypad, possibly using the ordinary a, b,
c, d, e, and f keys, and release AltR. This yields the Unicode
symbol with the code given.</p></li><li><p><b  >do_lock</b> toggles the state of the
corresponding modifier key lock. (Recall the line we saw above:
<b  >shift_final = shift_state ^ kbd-&lt;lockstate</b>.)
Thus, if you have your Cyrillic keys under combinations with AltR,
you can use AltR together with other keys to get only a few
Cyrillic symbols, but should type AltGr_Lock if you plan to type a
longish Cyrillic text. (Note that the right Alt key, that I called
AltR here, is usually known as AltGr.)</p></li><li><p><b  >do_lowercase</b> is used for the
handling of CapsLock. Note that CapsLock is different from
ShiftLock. With ShiftLock, a digit 4 will be turned into a dollar
sign (for default keyboard layout), but CapsLock will only affect
lower case letters, and turn them into the corresponding upper case
letters. Type 11 is equivalent to type 0, with the added
information that the symbol may be affected by CapsLock (and the
resulting character is the one that would have resulted from
pressing Shift).</p></li></ol></div><p>As already mentioned, almost all of this can be changed
dynamically by use of loadkeys(1). The current state is dumped by
dumpkeys(1). A list of known symbols is provided by dumpkeys -l.
The keycodes associated with the various keys can be found using
showkey(1). These and many other utilities for keyboard and console
can be found in kbd-0.90.tar.gz on ftp.funet.fi and its mirror
sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24e9580.0x28ee470"></a>Using loadkeys</h2></div></div><p>Use loadkeys to change the code produced by the BackSpace key
