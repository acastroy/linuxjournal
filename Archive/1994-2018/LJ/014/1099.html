    For those who have hesitated to upgrade to the new stable
    Linux version 1.2, Mark explains how to easily upgrade from
    version 1.0 (or any subsequent version) to version 1.2 --
    and even gives you a little help.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16a7580.0x179f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>With the release of Linux 1.2.x, there
have been a lot of questions on the newsgroups asking what needs to
be done to upgrade a stable 1.0.x system to a stable 1.2.x system.
Fortunately, this is relatively easy and painless.
</p><p>One thing you should note is that you should upgrade to the
1.2.1 kernel, especially if you are using firewall software.
Version 1.2.0 was somewhat broken in this respect.</p><p>The first thing you should realize is that a new program,
<span   class="bold"><b>bdflush</b></span>, is required by the 1.2.x
kernel. The program arrived early in the 1.1.x series and replaces
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span>, implementing a style of
disk caching that is a bit more efficient than the older style.
Without this program, your disk caching will not work as well, and
you will be warned: &ldquo;<b  >Warning - bdflush not
running</b>&rdquo;.</p><p>The networking tools should also be upgraded. The new
versions have been upgraded to support improvements in the kernel
networking code. Do note that normal networking programs do not
need to be upgraded; only a few special programs, included in a
single kit, are affected by the changes.</p><p>I have built a package that includes all of these programs.
It's called &ldquo;The Linux Upgrade 1.2&rdquo;, in a file called
linuxupgr-1.2.tar.gz. It is available at sunsite.unc.edu and its
mirrors in /pub/Linux/system/, and at tsx-11.mit.edu and its
mirrors in /pub/linux/binaries/sbin/. Download this package along
with the version 1.2.1 kernel, which should be available nearby in
the file linux-1.2.1.tar.gz. Sunsite and its mirrors have the
kernel in /pub/Linux/kernel/v1.2/, and tsx-11 and its mirrors have
the kernel in /pub/linux/sources/system/v1.2/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16a7580.0x179f710"></a>Upgrading Your Kernel</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Back everything up! Back up your system just in
case of any problems along the way. In case anything goes wrong,
you can always go back to a stable system. At least back up your
data files.</p></li><li><p>Make notes about your system. The kind of
filesystems you have, extra cards, sound card information, and so
on.
</p><p>From this point on, you should be the root user with few
users logged on.</p></li><li><p>Move the linux kernel tar file to the /usr/src
directory. <b  >mv linux-1.2.1.tar.gz /usr/src</b></p></li><li><p>Back up the old kernel by moving its directory tree
to a directory with another name. For example, if the old kernel is
a 1.0.9 kernel, you can (in the /usr/src directory) <b  >mv
linux linux-1.0.9</b>. This way, you still have the source to
the old 1.0.9 kernel available.</p></li><li><p>Uncompress and untar the kernel file by running
<b  >tar xzvf linux-1.2.1.tar.gz</b> You should see a
list of files being sent to the screen. They should all begin with
&ldquo;linux/&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Change to the linux directory and run <b  >make
config</b>. You will be offered options, for which you will
need the information you collected from step 2. In many cases, you
can take the defaults, unless you have a specialized system. Issue
7 of <i  >Linux Journal</i> had an article, &ldquo;Linux
Performance Tuning for the Faint of Heart&rdquo;, which specifically
covers how to compile new kernels.
</p><p>One specific item that is not covered in that article is the
new IDE driver in Linux 1.2. In the Linux kernel source, there is a
file drivers/block/README.ide that you should read if you have a
large IDE drive, multiple IDE controllers, or ATAPI IDE CD-ROM
drives. Nearly everyone will want to answer &ldquo;Use new IDE driver for
primary/secondary [interface]&rdquo; with yes. The only reason not to is
if you use MFM or RLL drives, since the new IDE driver supports
only IDE drives.</p></li><li><p>Once the configuration is ready, make the
dependencies needed by gcc to build the kernel correctly. Run
<b  >make dep</b>.</p></li><li><p>At this point, if you're using lilo, you can run
<b  >make zlilo</b> and the makefile will automatically
begin building the kernel and installing the new kernel in LILO. If
you boot off a floppy drive, you can just run <b  >make
zdisk</b>, and put a blank formatted 1.4 (or 1.2) MB disk in
the drive and makefile will build the kernel and install it on your
floppy.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>NOTE</b></span>: My preference is to
install first to a diskette, and boot from that. If there are no
problems, then I go back and run <b  >make zlilo</b>.
Another option is copying the current Linux kernel to another
filename (such as vmlinuz1.0.9) and making a new LILO entry for
that file. If you reboot with the first kernel and have problems,
you can reboot again, get into LILO, and boot the older kernel. If
you feel comfortable using LILO, this may be easier for you.</p></li><li><p>You will also need to tell the kernel file to mount
the root device read-only so that it can run fsck if necessary. If
you're using a floppy, run <b  >rdev -R /dev/fd0 1</b>.
If you're using LILO, run <b  >rdev -R /vmlinuz 1</b>.
Using the capital R here is important. If you are using LILO,
another option is to use the <b  >read-only</b> option
for the boot image. This is covered in the excellent LILO
documentation.</p></li><li><p>Once the kernel is built, install the Linux Upgrade
Package. From /usr/src, run <b  >tar xzvf
linuxupgr-1.2.tar.gz</b>. This will create a directory called
upgrade which has the bdflush and other assorted files in it. Read
the README file for instructions on installing the upgrade
files.</p></li><li><p>Reboot the machine. If you did everything
correctly, you should have a successfully running 1.2.1 kernel. If
you do run into problems and you are using a floppy disk, you can
pop the floppy out of the drive and reboot with the old
kernel.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16a7580.0x17a0580"></a>Misc. Other Upgrades</h2></div></div><p>There are a few other packages you may want to upgrade at
this point. Among them are <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>,
libraries, and the X Window System. However, the old versions will
work with the newer kernels, and upgrading is not necessary for
running Linux 1.2.1.</p><p>If you have any comments about this article or suggestions
