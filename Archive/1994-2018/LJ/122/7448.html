You can eliminate most known security
risks by removing unused software and keeping your
system up to date. Here's how to do it with the
new tool chosen by three of the most popular Linux
distributions.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23cd348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Updating your Linux system's software whenever security updates become
available is one of the most important things you can do to reduce
your exposure to bug-related vulnerabilities. It's so important that
I've written at length about it both in <i  >Linux Journal</i> (&ldquo;Staying Current
without Going Insane&rdquo;, July 2002) and in
Chapter 3 of my book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building
Secure Servers With Linux</em></span>.
</p><p>
Since I wrote those items (two years ago), the means by which you update
Debian and SuSE systems haven't changed too much: apt-get and YaST,
respectively, still are the preferred tools for this task.
But the Red Hat world has a new and noteworthy
utility called Yum (for Yellow Dog Updater, Modified). This month I
explain where to get Yum, how to set it up and how to use
it to simplify the task of keeping your Red Hat, Fedora or Mandrake
system up to date.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23cd5b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Patching Is Only One Step in the Security
Dance</b></p><p>
Let me be clear about one thing, keeping up to date with software
patches is something you must do <span   class="emphasis"><em>in addition to</em></span>, not instead of,
other system-hardening tasks. These other tasks include but are by no
means limited to:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Removing unnecessary software packages.
</p></li><li><p>
Minimizing the number of things that runs setuid root.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Running d&aelig;mons in chroot jails whenever possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Understanding and using whatever security features a given d&aelig;mon
supports.
</p></li><li><p>
Physically securing your system (for example, keeping it in a locked computer
room).
</p></li><li><p>
Making a habit of watching system and application logs for suspicious
activity.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Like log watching, applying security updates must be
an ongoing process. Subscribe to your distribution's
security mailing list, and apply patches as soon as
they're made available. The bad guys may not have
the courtesy to wait before striking.

Yum Overview</h2></div></div><p>
As its name implies, the Yellow Dog Updater, Modified evolved
from the Yellow Dog Updater, Yup, which is part of
the Yellow Dog Linux distribution for Macintosh computers.
Whereas Yup runs only on Yellow Dog
(Macintosh) systems, Yum presently works on Red Hat, Fedora, Mandrake
and Yellow Dog Linux, where it's replaced Yup.
Yum is a project of the Linux@DUKE team at Duke University;
Seth Vidal and Michael Stenner are credited with the better part of
the development work.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, Yum does for RPM-based systems what apt-get does for
Debian. It provides a simple command that can be used to
install or update a software package automatically, after first installing
and updating any other packages necessary to satisfy the desired
package's dependencies.
</p><p>
Yum actually consists of two commands: <tt  >yum</tt> is the client
command, and <tt  >yum-arch</tt> is a server-side command for creating
the header files necessary to turn a Web or FTP server into a Yum
repository. The yum-arch command is beyond the scope of this article, but
you need to use it if you want to set up a public Yum repository, a private Yum repository for packages you
maintain for local systems or even for a non-networked Yum
repository on your hard drive. yum-arch is simple to
use, and the yum-arch(8) man page tells you everything you need to know.
</p><p>
Unlike apt-rpm, a popular
port of apt-get for RPM-based distributions, Yum is native to the
RPM package format. And, says Michael Stenner, &ldquo;Yum is designed to
be simple and reliable, with more emphasis on keeping your machine
safe and stable than on client-side customization.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23ce160"></a>
Getting Yum</h2></div></div><p>
The Yum download site (see the on-line Resources section) explains
which version of Yum to download, depending on which version of Red Hat
or Fedora Linux you use. If you're a Fedora user,
Yum is part of Fedora Core 1, and the package yum-2.0.4-2.noarch.rpm is
on Disk 1 of your Fedora installation CD-ROMs. If you use Mandrake 9.2,
the package yum-2.0.1-1mdk.noarch.rpm is included in the distribution's
contrib/i586 directory.
</p><p>
Yum is written entirely in Python.
Therefore, in order to install any Yum RPM, your system
needs the Fedora/Red Hat packages python, gettext, rpm-python
and libxml2-python or their Mandrake equivalents. Chances are, all of
these packages already are on your system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23ce2c0"></a>
Finding Yum Repositories</h2></div></div><p>
From where can Yum pull its RPMs? Usually, this happens from a remote site
over the Internet. This being a security column, my emphasis here is
using Yum to grab security patches, so network updates are the focus
of the rest of this column. In the interest of completeness, however,
Yum can read RPMs from local filesystems or virtually local
filesystems, such as NFS mounts.
</p><p>
Whether on a remote or local server, the RPM collection must be a Yum
repository. It must include a directory called headers that contains
the RPM header information with which Yum identifies and satisfies RPM
dependencies. Therefore, you can't arbitrarily point Yum at any
old Red Hat mirror or Mandrake CD-ROM.
</p><p>
If you use Fedora Core 1 or 1.90, you can use Yum with any Fedora
mirror. Because Yum is an officially supported update mechanism for Fedora,
Fedora mirrors are set up as Yum repositories. And, did you know about the
Fedora Legacy Project? This branch of the Fedora effort provides security
updates to legacy Red Hat distributions, currently Red Hat 7.3, 8.0 and
9.0. Thus, many Fedora mirrors also contain Red Hat updates in the form
of Yum repositories.
</p><p>
If in doubt, a limited but handy list of Yum
repositories for a variety of distributions is available (see Resources).
Each of the links on
this list yields a block of text you can copy and paste directly into your
/etc/yum.conf file, which we explore in depth shortly. If all
else fails, Googling for <span   class="emphasis"><em>mydistroname</em></span> Yum repository is another way
to find repositories.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23ce528"></a>
Configuring Yum</h2></div></div><p>
Configuring Yum is fairly simple; all you need to do is edit one file,
which is named, predictably, /etc/yum.conf. Listing 1 shows the
default /etc/yum.conf file that comes with Fedora Core 1's Yum RPM.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23ce688"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Fedora Core 1's /etc/yum.conf File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
[main]
cachedir=/var/cache/yum
debuglevel=2
logfile=/var/log/yum.log

#baseurl=http://fedora.redhat.com/updates/testing/fedora-core-$releasever
</pre></div><p>
As you can see, this file consists of a list of global variable
settings, followed by one or more [server] blocks ([base] and
[updates-released] in Listing 1), each of which specifies settings
for a different type of RPM group. I'm not going to cover every possible
global or server block setting; that's what the yum.conf(5) man page
is for. But let's discuss a few key settings.
</p><p>
In the global section, debuglevel determines how verbose Yum's
output is. This value may range from 0, for no output, to 10, for maximum
debugging output. The default value of 2 is shown in Listing 1. As far as
I can tell, this debuglevel affects only standard output, not Yum's
log file, whose location is specified by logfile. Still, I like to
change this value to 4, which I arrived at by playing with the
<tt  >yum</tt>
command's -d value. For example, (<tt  >yum -d 4
<i>yum-commands</i></tt>)
is equivalent to and overrides debuglevel.
</p><p>
Also in the global section, pkgpolicy specifies how Yum should
decide which version to use if a given package turns up across multiple
[server] blocks. distroverpkg specifies the name of your local
release file package. Your release file, for example, /etc/fedora-release
or /etc/redhat-release, contains the name and version of your
Linux distribution.
</p><p>
Each [server] block defines a set of RPMs. Personally,
I wish these were called [package-type]
blocks instead, because they don't distinguish by server but
rather by RPM group. A single block may contain
the URLs of many servers. In Listing 1, the [base]
block contains a single URL pointing to the main
Fedora repository at fedora.redhat.com.
</p><p>
Fedora mirrors that contain the same collection of RPMs can be listed
with additional baseurl lines. Any line in a [server] block may use
the variables $releasever, which resolves to the version number of your
Linux distribution, and $basearch, which expands to the CPU family of
your system. CPU families exist here in the most generic sense; Athlons are considered part of
i386 in this context.
</p><p>
The /etc/yum.conf file installed by your Yum RPM probably
works fine, but you should augment each default
URL, http://fedora.redhat.com... in Listing 1, with at least one
mirror site URL. Doing so minimizes the chance that your updates fail due
to one server being unavailable.
Be sure to use your favorite Web browser to test-drive
any URL you add to yum.conf to make sure it successfully
resolves to a directory containing a directory named headers. Also,
make sure your URL ends with a trailing slash.
</p><p>
The other thing worth noting in Listing 1 is that one important [server]
option is missing: gpgcheck. Listing 2 shows a corrected [base]
block that uses this option.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x23cec08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Customized [base] Section</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&#8618;fedora-core-$releasever
gpgcheck=1
failovermethod=priority
</pre></div><p>
Setting <tt  >gpgcheck=1</tt> causes Yum to check the GnuPG signature in each
RPM it downloads. For this to work, you need the appropriate GnuPG
keys incorporated into your RPM database. On Fedora Core 1 systems,
these keys were installed on your system as part of the fedora-release
package. To copy them to your RPM database, execute this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/fedora-release-1/RPM-GPG*
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >rpm --import</tt> command also can use a URL as its argument,
so if the GnuPG key of your Yum source is on-line, you can use the form:


<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm --import <i>http://your.distro.homepage/GPGsignature</i>
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x27c7380"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <i>http://your.distro.homepage/GPGsignature</i> should be replaced
with a real URL.
</p><p>
This may seem like a hassle, but it's worth it. Several
intrusions on Linux distributors' sites over the years have resulted
in trojaned or otherwise compromised software packages being downloaded
by unsuspecting users. Taking advantage of RPM's support for GnuPG
signatures is the best defense against such skulduggery.
</p><p>
The other notable change in Listing 2 is that I've specified
<tt  >failovermethod=priority</tt>, which tells Yum to try
the URLs on
this list in order, starting with the one at the top. The default
behavior, <tt  >failovermethod=roundrobin</tt>, is for Yum to choose one
of the listed URLs at random. Personally, I prefer the priority
method because it lets me prioritize faster, closer mirrors over
my distribution's primary site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x27c7698"></a>
Running Yum Automatically</h2></div></div><p>
Now we come to the easy part, using the <tt  >yum</tt> command. There
are two ways to run Yum, manually from a command prompt or
automatically by way of the /etc/init.d/yum startup script.
If enabled, which you must do manually by issuing a <tt  >chkconfig
--add yum</tt> command, this script simply touches a runfile,
/var/lock/subsys/yum, which the cron.daily job yum.cron
checks for. If the script is enabled, that is, if the runfile exists, this
cron job runs the Yum command first to check for and install an
updated Yum package and then to check for and install updates for all
other system packages. In so doing, Yum automatically and
transparently resolves any relevant dependencies. If an updated package
depends on another package, even if it didn't previously, Yum
retrieves and installs the other package.
</p><p>
For most users, this script is powerful and useful stuff. If your
environment demands meticulous change-control procedures, however,
and you don't want any new software installed automatically, you should
run Yum manually.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x27c78a8"></a>
Running Yum Manually</h2></div></div><p>
To see a list of available updates without installing anything, use
<tt  >yum check-update</tt> (Listing 3).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d5580.0x27c7a08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Checking for updates (output slightly reformatted and

To install a single update, plus any other updates necessary to resolve
dependencies, use <tt  >yum update
<i>packagename</i></tt>, for example:
<tt  >yum update yum</tt>.
</p><p>
This example actually updates Yum itself. If indeed an updated
version of the package Yum is available, you are prompted
to go ahead and install it. If you're invoking Yum from a script
and you want all such prompts to be answered y automatically, use the
-y option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
yum -y update yum
</pre>
</p><p>
The check-update command, the Yum command that is, isn't
mandatory before installing updates. If you prefer, you can use
<tt  >yum update</tt> directly&mdash;it performs the same checks
as <tt  >yum
check-update</tt>.
</p><p>
In the last sample command, we specified a single package to update,
<tt  >yum</tt>. To initiate a complete update session for all installed
packages on your system, you simply can omit the last argument, the
package specification: <tt  >yum update</tt>.
</p><p>
After Yum checks for all available updates and calculates dependencies,
it presents you with a list of all updates it intends to download.
Unless you used the -y option, it asks you whether to download
and install each of them.
</p><p>
For the sake of completeness here's a bonus tip: you also can install new
packages with Yum&mdash;you probably figured that out already. For any
package contained in the sources you've defined in /etc/yum.conf,
you can use the command <tt  >yum install
<i>packagename</i></tt> to install
the latest version of that package, plus anything it depends on. For
example, to install the FTP server package vsftpd, you'd issue this
command: <tt  >yum install vsftpd</tt>.

Further Information</h2></div></div><p>
If you have any problems using Yum, ample help,
including two excellent FAQs, is available on-line.
See the on-line Resources section.
If the on-line documentation doesn't help, a
Yum mailing list is available too. Before posting a question, however,
be sure to try a Google search or two. In the course
of writing this article, I found a number of postings
to the Yum mailing list addressing various questions
and problems I had, all located with Google.
