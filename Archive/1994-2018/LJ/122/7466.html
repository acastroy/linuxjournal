Now you can control USB hardware without
touching the kernel and even make your
driver run on BSD-based OSes with no code changes. Greg shows
a working example for using the cross-platform USB library,
libusb.

Last time we discussed how to create a simple USB driver that
controlled a USB LED device manufactured by Delcom Engineering
[<i  >LJ</i>, April 2004]. I would
like to thank all of the readers who have given me feedback on the column.
It even enabled one reader to write a driver now in the main
kernel tree. I also would like to thank everyone who has given me
ideas about what kinds of devices to write about in future columns, but
please remember, let's try to cover simple devices. We don't have the
room here to go over how to reverse engineer a streaming video camera
that has about 12 different modes of operation.

usbfs Overview</h2></div></div><p>
At the end of the last column, I said it is simple
to talk to a USB device from user space, without needing a custom kernel
driver. Way back during the development of the original Linux USB code,
a few developers recognized that it would be wise to allow user programs
to get at the raw USB data in all devices in addition to
controlling the device. To that end, the usbfs filesystem was created.
It originally was called usbdevfs, but many people confused
it with the devfs filesystem and all of the nasty baggage that filesystem
brought on, so it was renamed usbfs.
</p><p>
Traditionally, usbfs is mounted in the /proc/bus/usb directory on your
machine. In that main directory exists a file called devices
and a directory for every different USB bus connected to the
machine. Those bus directories are named with a number that corresponds
to the number the kernel has given that particular USB bus.
In each bus directory is a file for every different USB device
connected to the bus. For example, a box that has six different USB
buses and a few USB devices connected might look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tree /proc/bus/usb/
/proc/bus/usb/
|-- 001
|   `-- 001
|-- 002
|   `-- 001
|-- 003
|   `-- 001
|-- 004
|   |-- 001
|   |-- 002
|   `-- 003
|-- 005
|   `-- 001
|-- 006
|   `-- 001
`-- devices
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945608"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you do not have any USB host controller drivers loaded,
the main /proc/bus/usb/ directory should be empty.
</p><p>
The /proc/bus/usb/devices file contains a list of all USB devices
attached at that moment in time. It also shows how the devices are
connected to one another and a lot of other USB-specific information
about each device. For details on how the data in this file should be
interpreted, see the documentation in the kernel tree
at Documentation/usb/proc_usb_info.txt. Programs such as usbview or
usbtree use this file to show information about USB devices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945768"></a>
usbfs Device Files</h2></div></div><p>
The files within the /proc/bus/usb/BBB/ directories, where BBB is the
number of the USB bus, allow programs to talk directly to the different USB
devices. The name of the files are the same number as the
USB number assigned to the device: 001 for the first device, 002 for
the second and so on. Do not rely on these numbers to be unique, as
the USB subsystem reuses the numbers when devices are removed and added.
If device 003 is removed and another, different device is added,
it gets the 003 number.
</p><p>
If you read from the device file, the raw USB descriptor is
returned&mdash;first the USB device descriptor and then the different configuration
descriptors. For a detailed description of what format these descriptors
are in and what all of the data means, see the USB specification,
which is available for download at the USB Developers Web site (<a href="http://www.usb.org/developers" target="_self">www.usb.org/developers</a>).
</p><p>
The device file also supports a wide range of ioctl calls that allows
programs to send and receive USB data from the device. These ioctls
and the structures needed for the ioctls are described in the
kernel file include/linux/usbdevice_fs.h.
</p><p>
Armed with these ioctls, the structures defined in this header file and
a copy of the USB specification, we are set to write a user-space program
to talk to our device. But do we really want to do this? Wouldn't it
be great if someone wrote a library on top of this interface that would
enable us to write sane programs? Luckily, a group of developers has
created such a library, allowing programmers to ignore the ioctl
mess that usbfs uses. This library is called libusb.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945a28"></a>
libusb</h2></div></div><p>
libusb is a library that works on a number of
different operating systems: Linux, the various
BSDs and Mac OS X. It allows programs to be written
in a portable manner and yet still control USB
devices on vastly different operating systems.
Using this library lets us create a program to
control the USB LED device. libusb can be downloaded
from <a href="http://libusb.sf.net" target="_self">libusb.sf.net</a> if it is not included in
your Linux distribution.
</p><p>
The first thing any libusb program must do is initialize the library
and have it scan all USB buses for all USB devices. This is done with
the following three function calls:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usb_init(); usb_find_busses(); usb_find_devices();
</pre>
</p><p>
After the call is complete, the program needs to find a USB device that
matches the desired description. As all USB devices have
unique vendor and product identification values, it usually is
easiest to look for these values. As we remember from the kernel driver we
created last time, the USB LED device has the following vendor and
product values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define LED_VENDOR_ID	0x0fc5
#define LED_PRODUCT_ID  0x1223
</pre>
</p><p>
With this information, the code to find this device using libusb is
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (usb_bus = usb_busses; usb_bus;
     usb_bus = usb_bus-&gt;next) {
        for (dev = usb_bus-&gt;devices; dev;
             dev = dev-&gt;next) {
            if ((dev-&gt;descriptor.idVendor ==
                 LED_VENDOR_ID) &amp;&amp;
                (dev-&gt;descriptor.idProduct ==
                 LED_PRODUCT_ID))
                return dev;
	}
}
return NULL;

</pre>
</p><p>
If the device is found in the system, a pointer to it is returned,
otherwise NULL is returned. This pointer is of type struct usb_device.
After this structure is found, the USB device must be opened and a
handle must be created by libusb for the program to
communicate with the device. This is done with the following simple code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usb_handle = usb_open(usb_dev);
if (usb_handle == NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr,
            "Not able to claim the USB device\n");
    goto exit;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This usb_handle variable is of type struct usb_dev_handle, and it is what
libusb uses to determine with which USB device it should communicate.
This handle is all that is needed to set up
our USB device to be ready to communicate with it.
</p><p>
When the program is finished with the USB device, a
call to <tt  >usb_close(usb_handle);</tt>
is all that is necessary to clean up all of our structures and notify
libusb that the device is no longer needed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2945f50"></a>
Changing Colors</h2></div></div><p>
Last time we set the color of the USB LED device
from within our kernel driver with the following
code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usb_control_msg(led-&gt;udev,
                usb_sndctrlpipe(led-&gt;udev, 0),
                0x12,
                0xc8,
                (0x02 * 0x100) + 0x0a,
                (0x00 * 0x100) + color,
                buffer,
                8,
                2 * HZ);
</pre>
</p><p>
libusb offers us an almost identical function call
to send control messages to a USB device. It also is
called usb_control_msg(), and to send the same
type of color message as we did from within the
kernel, our user-space program does it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
usb_control_msg(handle,
                0xc8,
                0x12,
                (0x02 * 0x100) + 0x0a,
                (0c00 * 0x100) + color,
                buffer,
                8,
                5000);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x284d580.0x2946160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Other than the request type and request variables
being reversed from the kernel function call, it
looks identical.
</p><p>
Using libusb cuts down extremely
the complexities of writing to a USB device, and it gives us a
cross-platform program that is much better than a specific kernel driver
for most devices.

Listing 1 allows any
mixture of the three possible colors this device offers to be
set. Simply pass the colors as command-line arguments
to make changes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
To set the red led:
        set_led red
To set the green and blue led:
        set_led green blue
To turn off all leds:

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope that this example encourages you to
experiment with libusb as a simple alternative to
writing a kernel driver. USB devices almost
always can be controlled properly with user-space
programs instead of specialized kernel
drivers. User-space programs using libusb are much
easier to debug, do not require a special kernel
version to be used and work across a wide range of
operating systems.
