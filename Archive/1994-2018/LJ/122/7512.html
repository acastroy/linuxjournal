    Jefferson said, &ldquo;The government is best which governs least.&rdquo;
    By committing itself to free software, government keeps citizens' options open.
  </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb8580.0x20b02f0"></a></h2></div></div><p> As I write this, the
Linux Users Group of Iraq is forming an organization
called the Iraqi Open Source Organization (IOSO)
to help get the new Iraqi government on the path of
open-source software and open standards. They're
joining a worldwide movement to put open source into
government IT that's strong enough that proprietary
software vendors have founded a lobbying group called
the &ldquo;Initiative for Software Choice&rdquo;
(ISC) to oppose it. The ISC doesn't merely oppose
open-source code; it also tracks and opposes measures
that would simply require specs to be openly published
for interoperability. </p><p> Telling a government it should accept
proprietary software licenses is like telling it
that it needs to visit a shady rent-to-own store
for furniture instead of using competitive
bidding. Governments are big enough to get
a better deal. And &ldquo;software choice&rdquo;
for a government purchasing department could mean
software lock-in for citizens. Until late last year,
the US Federal Communications Commission's Web-based
Universal Licensing System, mandatory for radio
licensees, required a non-Linux OS.
</p><p>
On page 58, Jim Beard shows how open standards can
make a government process work. Find out how
courts, lawyers and organizations
are keeping the new flood of paperless communication
together with new standards anyone can use.

Our Senior Editor Doc Searls spent early 2004 in
the storm of the presidential primaries,
with special attention to Howard Dean frenzy.
Our contributor Tony Steidler-Dennison went to
work for the Wesley Clark campaign.
Neither Dean nor Clark got very far, but Doc learned
some valuable lessons that might help you in your next
political campaign.
Find out how you can join the political process
on page 52.

Remember the little USB lamp on the cover of the
April 2004 issue? Greg Kroah-Hartman told me that he
got more responses to his article on
a driver for it than to anything else he's written.
Congratulations, new kernel hackers. Now, if you'd
rather write user-space programs instead, Greg explains
how to control a USB device that way on page 40.
Now there's no excuse not to support whatever USB device
follows you home from the electronics store.
Be sure to let us know how it goes.

Dave Phillips is back with another software roundup&mdash;this time covering
soundfile editors on page 84. And, if
you're ready to have your mind expanded with a giant
leap in communications design, flip to page 76 and
get the facts on software radio from Eric Blossom.
</p><p>
Finally, as you might be able to tell from the
cover, we're proud to bring you the latest from
Douglas Maxwell on a new simulation for training
firefighters (page 48). The project may be kind of esoteric,
but it depends on the same Linux and free software we
all use every day. If you're writing, documenting
or testing free software, you're helping vital,
even lifesaving projects without even knowing it.
Stay free, and enjoy the issue.
