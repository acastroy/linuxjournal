Whether you're plugging a camera and
scanner in to your laptop or adding another SCSI
drive to your company server, it's time to end the
current mess of major and minor numbers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x2716348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Starting with the 2.5 kernel, all physical and
virtual devices in a system are visible to user space
in a hierarchal fashion through sysfs.
/sbin/hotplug provides a notification to user space
when any device is added or removed from the system.
Using these two features, a user-space implementation
of a dynamic /dev now is possible that can provide a
flexible device naming policy.
</p><p>
This article discusses udev, a program that
replaces the functionality of devfs. It provides
/dev entries for devices in the system at
any moment in time. It also provides features
previously unavailable through devfs
alone, such as
persistent naming for devices when they move
around the device tree,
a flexible device naming scheme,
notification of external systems of device
changes and
moving all naming policy out of the kernel.
</p><p>
The /dev directory on a Linux machine is where all
of the device files for the system should be
located. A device file details how a user program can
access a specific hardware device or function. For
example, the device file /dev/hda traditionally
is used to represent the first IDE drive in the system.
The name hda corresponds to both a major and a minor
number, which are used by the kernel to determine
what hardware device to talk to. Currently, a
wide range of names that match up to different major
and minor numbers has been defined.
</p><p>
All major and minor numbers are assigned a name that
matches up with a type of device. This allocation
is done by the Linux assigned names and numbers
authority (LANANA), and the current device list can
be found on its Web site (see the on-line Resources section).
</p><p>
As Linux begins supporting new kinds of
devices, these devices need to be assigned a major and
minor number range in order for users
to access them through the /dev directory.
An alternative is to provide access through
a filesystem; my 2002 linux.conf.au paper
provides more details on how to do this (see the on-line Resources
section). In kernel
versions 2.4 and earlier, the valid range of major
numbers was 1&ndash;255, and the valid range of minor numbers was 1&ndash;255.
Because of this limited range, a freeze was placed on
allocating new major and minor numbers during the 2.3
development cycle. This freeze since has been lifted,
and the 2.6 kernel had the valid range of major
numbers increased to 4,095. More than a
million minor numbers are available per major number.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x27165b0"></a>What /dev Entry Is Which Device</h2></div></div><p>
When the kernel finds a new piece of hardware, it
typically assigns the next major/minor pair for that
kind of hardware to the device. So, on boot, the
first USB printer found would be assigned the major
number 180 and minor number 0, which is referenced in
/dev as /dev/usb/lp0. The second USB printer would
be assigned major number 180 and minor number 1,
which is referenced in /dev as /dev/usb/lp1. If the
user rearranges the USB topology, perhaps adding a
USB hub to support more USB devices in the
system, the USB probing order of the printers might
change the next time the computer is booted,
reversing the assignment of the different minor
numbers to the two printers.
</p><p>
This same situation holds true for almost any kind
of device that can be removed or added while the
computer is powered up. With the advent of PCI
hot-plug-enabled systems and hot-pluggable buses, such as IEEE 1394, USB and CardBus, almost all devices
have this problem.
</p><p>
With the advent of the sysfs filesystem in the 2.5
kernel, the problem of determining which device
minor number is assigned to which physical device is
much easier to determine. For a system having two
different USB printers plugged in to it, the sysfs
/sys/class/usb directory tree would look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

/sys/class/usb/
|-- lp0
|   |-- dev
|   |-- device -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0/00:09.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:0
|   `-- driver -&gt; ../../../bus/usb/drivers/usblp
`-- lp1
    |-- dev
    |-- device -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0/00:0d.0/usb3/3-1/3-1:0
    `-- driver -&gt; ../../../bus/usb/drivers/usblp

$ cat /sys/class/usb/lp0/device/serial
HXOLL0012202323480
$ cat /sys/class/usb/lp1/device/serial
W09090207101241330

</pre>
</p><p>
Within the individual USB device directories pointed
to by the lp0/device and lp1/device symbolic links,
a lot of USB-specific information can be determined,
such as the manufacturer of the device and the
(hopefully unique) serial number.
</p><p>
As can be seen by the serial files in the above
description, the /dev/usb/lp0 device file is
associated with the USB printer with serial number
HXOLL0012202323480, and the /dev/usb/lp1 device file
is associated with the USB printer with serial
number W09090207101241330.
If these printers are moved around, say by placing them
both behind a USB hub, they might be renamed, as
they are probed in a different order on startup:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tree /sys/class/usb/
/sys/class/usb/
|-- lp0
|   |-- dev
|   |-- device -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0/00:09.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1/1-1.1:0
|   `-- driver -&gt; ../../../bus/usb/drivers/usblp
`-- lp1
    |-- dev
    |-- device -&gt; ../../../devices/pci0/00:09.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.4/1-1.4:0
    `-- driver -&gt; ../../../bus/usb/drivers/usblp

$ cat /sys/class/usb/lp0/device/serial
W09090207101241330
$ cat /sys/class/usb/lp1/device/serial
HXOLL0012202323480

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x2716978"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As this description shows, the /dev/usb/lp0 device
now is assigned to the USB printer with the
serial number W09090207101241330 due to this
different probing order.
</p><p>
sysfs enables a user to determine which device
has been assigned by the kernel to which device
file. This is a powerful association that previously had
not been easily available. However, a
user generally does not care that /dev/usb/lp0 and
/dev/usb/lp1 are now reversed and should be changed
in a configuration file somewhere. The user simply wants
to be able to print to the proper printer, no
matter where it is in the USB device tree.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x2716ad8"></a>
/dev Is Too Big</h2></div></div><p>
Not all device files in the /dev directory of most
distributions match up to a physical device that is
currently connected to the computer.
Instead, the /dev directory is created when the
operating system is initialized on the machine,
populating the /dev directory with all known
possible names. On a machine running Red Hat's
Fedora release 1, the /dev directory holds more than 18,000 different entries.
This many
entries soon become unwieldy for
users trying to determine exactly what devices
currently are present.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x2716be0"></a>
devfs</h2></div></div><p>
Because of the large numbers of device files in the
/dev directory, a number of operating systems have
moved to having the kernel itself manage the
/dev directory, as the kernel always knows exactly
what devices are present on the system. It does
this by creating a RAM-based filesystem called
devfs. Linux also has this option, and it has
become popular over time in a number of different
distributions, including Gentoo.
</p><p>
For a number of people, devfs
solves their immediate needs. However, the
Linux-based devfs implementation still has a number
of unsolved problems. Most notably, it does not
provide the ability to create device nodes with a persistent name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x2716d40"></a>
udev's goals</h2></div></div><p>
In light of the previously mentioned
problems, the udev Project was started. Its goals
are to run in user space;
create a dynamic /dev;
provide consistent device naming, if wanted; and
provide a user-space API to access information about current system devices.
For more on how udev compares with devfs, see the on-line Resources
section.
</p><p>
The first item, run in user space, is accomplished
by harnessing the fact that /sbin/hotplug generates
an event for every device added to or removed
from the system with sysfs' ability
to show all the needed information about all devices.
</p><p>
The second item, create a dynamic /dev, is handled by
catching all /sbin/hotplug events,
looking up the major and minor number in sysfs for
the added device and creating a /dev file with the
kernel name the device was assigned. If the
device was removed from the system, it is
easy to remove the /dev entry for that
device.
</p><p>
udev achieved these first two goals back in April
2003 in an extremely tiny 6Kb of compiled code,
proving that this scheme of catching hot-plug events
and using sysfs was feasible and quite simple to
implement.
Since that humble beginning in early 2003, udev has
achieved all of its goals. It
provides users with the ability to name devices in a
persistent manner using a flexible rule-based
system.
</p><p>
udev's rules are contained in the
/etc/udev/udev.rules file and describe any devices
the user wants to name in a way that differs
from the default kernel name. Here's
an example of a udev.rules file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# if /sbin/scsi_id returns "OEM 0815" device will
# be called disk1
BUS="scsi", PROGRAM="/sbin/scsi_id", \
RESULT="OEM 0815", NAME="disk1"

# USB printer to be called lp_color
BUS="usb", SYSFS_serial="W09090207101241330", \
NAME="lp_color"

# SCSI disk with a specific vendor and model number
# is to be called boot
BUS="scsi", SYSFS_vendor="IBM", \
SYSFS_model="ST336", NAME="boot"

# sound card with PCI bus id 00:0b.0 to be called dsp
BUS="pci", ID="00:0b.0", NAME="dsp"

# USB mouse at third port of the second hub to
# be called mouse1
BUS="usb", PLACE="2.3", NAME="mouse1"

# ttyUSB1 should always be called pda with two
# additional symlinks
KERNEL="ttyUSB1", NAME="pda", \
SYMLINK="palmtop handheld"

# multiple USB webcams with symlinks to be called
# webcam0, webcam1, ...
BUS="usb", SYSFS_model="XV3", NAME="video%n", \
SYMLINK="webcam%n"

</pre>
</p><p>
A udev rule defines the mapping between a device's
attributes and the desired device filename.
To do this, a number of keys can be
queried from the device to determine a match.
If no match is found in the udev.rules file, the
default kernel name is used.
Below is a list of the different types of keys that udev
understands:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
BUS: matches the bus type of the device;
examples of this include PCI, USB or
SCSI.
</p></li><li><p>
KERNEL: matches the name the kernel gives the
device.
</p></li><li><p>
ID: matches the device number on the bus; for
example, the PCI bus ID or the USB device ID.
</p></li><li><p>
PLACE: matches the topological position on bus,
such as the physical port a USB device is plugged in to.
</p></li><li><p>
SYSFS_filename, SYSFS{filename}:
allows udev to match any sysfs device
attribute, such as label, vendor, USB serial
number or SCSI UUID. Up to five different sysfs
files can be checked in a single rule, with all
of the values being required in order to match
the rule.
</p></li><li><p>
PROGRAM: allows udev to call an external program
and check the result. This key is valid
if the program returns successfully. The string
returned by the program additionally
may be matched with the RESULT key.
</p></li><li><p>
RESULT: matches the returned string of the last PROGRAM
call. This key may be used in any rule
following a PROGRAM call.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
After the different keys, a NAME and optional
SYMLINK are specified. The NAME is what udev
uses to call the device if the rule matches, and the
SYMLINK specifies what, if any, symlinks also
are generated. More than one symlink can be specified at
once, with spaces between multiple symlinks. Both
the NAME and SYMLINK files can contain directories
to allow /dev to be simplified.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x2717630"></a>
Example</h2></div></div><p>
So, back to our two-printer example. To name
both of these devices in a consistent manner, the
following two udev rules might be used:

<pre     class="programlisting">

BUS="usb", SYSFS_serial="W09090207101241330", \
NAME="lp_color"
BUS="usb", SYSFS_serial="HXOLL0012202323480", \
NAME="lp_plain"

</pre>
</p><p>
These rules cause udev to look at the sysfs file
serial for both printers and, depending on the
value in the file, name the printer either
lp_color or lp_plain. This ensures that no
matter which device was plugged in first or
detected first or whether another USB printer is added
to the system, both of the printers have
the same persistent name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x27177e8"></a>
Advanced udev Rules</h2></div></div><p>
udev allows a number of printf-like string
substitutions to be used in the NAME, SYMLINK and
PROGRAM fields in the udev.rules file. These fields
are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
%n: kernel number of the device; for example,
the device sda3 has a kernel number of 3.
</p></li><li><p>
%k: kernel name for the device.
</p></li><li><p>
%M: kernel major number for the device.
</p></li><li><p>
%m: kernel minor number for the device.
</p></li><li><p>
%b: bus ID for the device.
</p></li><li><p>
%c: PROGRAM returned string. A number can be
added to this modifier to pick up only a
specific word within the string. This field
does not work within the PROGRAM field for the
obvious reason.
</p></li><li><p>
%%: % character itself.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Also, a number of the different keys support a
simple form of shell-style pattern matching. These
patterns are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
*: matches zero, one or more characters.
</p></li><li><p>
?: matches any single character but does not match
zero characters.
</p></li><li><p>
[ ]: matches any single character specified within
the brackets; for example, the pattern string
<tt  >tty[SR]</tt> would match either
<tt  >ttyS</tt> or <tt  >ttyR</tt>.
Ranges also are supported within this match with
the - character. For example, to match on the
range of all digits, the pattern [0-9] would be
used. If the first character following the [
is !, any character not enclosed is
matched.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Because of the ability to do these simple string
substitutions and string pattern matching, combined
with the ability to have udev run any other program
and use its result, udev has become an extremely
flexible tool for naming devices.
As an example of this power, take a look at the
following rule:

<pre     class="programlisting">

KERNEL="[hs]d[a-z]", PROGRAM="name_cdrom.pl %M %m", \
NAME="%1c", SYMLINK="cdrom"

</pre>
</p><p>
This rule matches any block device and calls the
Perl script name_cdrom.pl with the major and minor
number of the device. If this program is
successful, udev uses the first word of the
program's output to name the device and creates a
symlink called cdrom. The name_cdrom.pl script
can be found in the udev release.
</p><p>
What this script does is determine whether the device is
a CD-ROM device. If it is, it queries the Free CDDB
database to see if the CD-ROM present in the device
is known in the database. If it is, it then names
the device based on the CD. For example, my /dev
looks like the following when using this rule:



<pre     class="programlisting">

$ ls -l /dev/S* /dev/cdrom
brw-------  1 root root 22, 64 Feb 15 08:26 /dev/Samiam-Astray
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      8 Feb 15 08:26 /dev/cdrom -&gt;
/dev/Samiam-Astray

</pre>
</p><p>
This shows how udev can query a database across the Internet to determine
how to name a device. Yes, it's a crazy naming scheme to try to use, but
it shows how powerful and flexible udev can be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x261e580.0x270ecd8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>
The author would like to thank Daniel Stekloff of IBM, who has helped
shape the design of udev in many ways. Without his perseverance, udev
would not be available at all. Also, Kay Sievers has been instrumental in
implementing the majority of the advanced features in udev, most notably
the ability to have string modifiers and pattern matching, both of which
are essential for using udev in the real world. Without his help, udev
would not be anywhere near as powerful and useful as it is.
</p><p>
Also, without Pat Mochel's sysfs and driver model core, udev would not
have been possible to implement. The author is indebted to him for
undertaking what most thought of as an impossible task and for allowing
others to build easily on his common framework, allowing all users to see
the &ldquo;Web woven by a spider on drugs&rdquo; that the kernel keeps
track of.
