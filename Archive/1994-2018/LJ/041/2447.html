<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> command and what should
they contain?  &mdash;Chris MasonSlackware 2.0.29</p><p>In the good old days before the Web, there were no home
pages. Instead, if I wanted to find out more about someone, I would
&ldquo;finger&rdquo; them. The <span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span>
command asks the server to display information about a user,
including the contents of the user's .plan and .project files. You
can put any information you wish in these files: your name, e-mail
address, fax and phone numbers or favorite sayings.</p><p>Note that many system administrators consider the
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> command to be a potential
security risk and have turned it off, so don't be surprised if you
&ldquo;finger&rdquo; someone and receive a message along the lines of
&ldquo;access denied&rdquo;. Also, many implementations of
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> read only the .plan
file. &mdash;Vince Waldon vwaldon@skynet.uah.ualberta.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x26793f8"></a>Linux and Pentiums</h2></div></div><p>I have a PC with an Intel Pentium 150. Will Linux run on it?
I've heard it runs on a 386 or a 486 but has trouble with certain
IBMs&mdash;I'm not sure which ones. &mdash;Noah Roberts</p><p>You should have no problem running Linux on the machine you
describe. Early versions of the Linux kernel were unable to support
true IBM machines that used the microchannel architecture or MCA
(the PS\2 line). That's probably the IBM computer referred
to. &mdash;Vince Waldon vwaldon@skynet.uah.ualberta.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679558"></a>Spinning Hard Drive</h2></div></div><p>My hard drive spins up and spins down constantly. There is a
kernel patch called <span   class="bold"><b>no_idle</b></span> on
Sunsite [http://sunsite.unc.edu/] to fix this problem, but when I
attempt to apply the patch I get a reject file. It seems that the
Makefile for the disk drivers has now been created, and as a
result, the patch does not apply correctly. I am running 2.0.0. I
would like to know if there is something else I could do to stop
the spinning. I would appreciate any help.  &mdash;John BarnitzSlackware
3.1
</p><p>Most likely you need to find the hdparm package and use it to
set the spin down times. I know it can do this for IDE drives. If
it's not part of your distribution, you can find it on
Sunsite. &mdash;Donnie Barnes, Red Hat Software redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679710"></a>SCSI Drivers</h2></div></div><p>Are there any drivers that provide SCSI support on the
  motherboard? &mdash;Ryan Red Hat 4.1</p><p>That depends on the type of SCSI you wish to use. You can
check the hardware compatibility lists at
http://www.redhat.com/. &mdash;Donnie Barnes, Red Hat
Software redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679870"></a>Non-English Keyboard Characters</h2></div></div><p>After installing Linux, I noticed I am missing an option
available in MS Windows: the US-International keyboard layout. This
layout lets anyone with a US keyboard type the special punctuation
needed for foreign languages. I live in Puerto Rico, and most, if
not all, keyboards sold here are US versions. Since I write mostly
in Spanish, I am interested in learning how to make a keymap that
emulates Windows' US-International layout. Is there any information
about the subject or any already-made keymap file that fits the
job? &mdash;Carlos M. Fernandez Red Hat 4.1</p><p>There may indeed be a keyboard mapping that fits your
keyboard. If not, you will have to take one that is close to your
desired arrangement and modify it.</p><p>You should obtain the <span   class="bold"><b>kbd</b></span>
package from
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/keyboards/kbd-0.98.tar.gz.
It contains tools, documentation and examples that will assist you
in your remapping project. It also contains a file called kbd.FAQ,
which contains answers to frequently asked questions about the
operation of the keyboard under Linux. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT

command <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span>. I have several users
on my system. While I don't want to eliminate the capability of
these users to change to other IDs, I do want to eliminate the
capability to use <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> to change to
root for all except one or two users. Is this possible? &mdash;Are
Tysl Slackware 3.1</p><p>You may be missing a handy program called
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span>, which you can obtain from
your nearest Sunsite mirror. This program allows you to configure
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> actions for each user based on
who the user is and what you wish him to be able to access.</p><p>If that does not meet your goal, why not fall back to the
standard Unix security functions? Create a new group called su.
Change the group on /bin/su from bin to su. The permissions are
most likely 4755 (-rwsr-xr-x), which means anybody can execute it
and the program will execute as root.bin.</p><p>You can then change the permissions of /bin/su. Try changing
them to 4750 (-rwsr-x---), which allows root or any user in the su
group to execute it. Then you can put those users you wish to have
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> privileges in the su
group. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services
Corporation chadr@brttech.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2581580.0x2679e48"></a>Man Page Display</h2></div></div><p>How do I use <span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span>? For
example, when I enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
man ls
</pre><p>I get a blank screen with a weird message at the bottom of
the screen&mdash;something like 1/1. Whatever I enter, it beeps at
me. &mdash;Josh Gray Slackware 3.2
</p><p>Check whether there are any files in the /usr/man/manx
directory (where x is a number, usually from 1 to 8). You should
find several different files with names like gpm.1. Each of these
files is a man page. Whenever you use the
<span   class="bold"><b>man</b></span> command, you get a processed
version of the file corresponding to the command specified (for the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command, it is the ls.x file).
For this file to be processed, the
<span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> utility must be installed.
<span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> is usually found in the
/usr/bin directory. &mdash;Mario de Mello Bittencourt Neto,

since created a swap file but I have to enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
swapon /dev/hda5
</pre><p>every time I boot, and I can do it only as root. Can I make
  this simpler? &mdash;Josh Gray Slackware 3.2
</p><p>Slackware puts entries to automatically mount swap partitions
(if they exist) in your rc script files. All you need to do is tell
those files that your swap partition exists and is available for
use. To do that, put a line in the /etc/fstab file like the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda5    swap    swap    defaults    1   1
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This tells the system to set up a swap space from
/dev/hda5 with the default settings for a swap partition. This
entry is normally created by the setup scripts when you install
Slackware, and is the missing item that prevents your swap area
from being initialized with each boot. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT
