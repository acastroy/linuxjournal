    University of Colorado students are using Linux to control
    their robotic cars in a race with vehicles from around the
    world.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22d92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Association for Unmanned Vehicle
Systems International (AUVSI) sponsors a yearly robotic vehicle
contest. Schools from around the world gather to see whose vehicle
will navigate an outdoor course the fastest and the farthest.
Vehicles have no prior knowledge of the layout of the course.
</p><p>The course track is defined by white or yellow lines painted
on the grass, and the robot must stay within these lines. Obstacles
of various sizes, sand traps, deep grades and sharp curves occur
along the way to keep things exciting. The difficulty increases as
the robot progresses down the course. In addition to navigating the
pathways, the robot must carry a 20 pound load and cannot exceed a
speed limit of five miles per hour. Each robot has three tries at
navigating the course, and the winner is chosen based on the time
used and distance traveled. Penalties are assessed for crossing
lines and hitting obstacles. So far no team has successfully
navigated the full length of the course.</p><p>This year's contest was held at Oakland University in
Rochester, Michigan on May 31st, June 1st and June 2nd. Rules for
the 1997 contest can be found on the Web at
http://www.secs.oakland.edu/SECS_prof_orgs/PROF_AUVSI/rules97.html.</p><p><a href="2202f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Diagram of the Race Course</b></span></a></p><p>Robocar is the University of Colorado (CU) at Boulder's entry
in this contest. Starting with a child's electric car, our team
added basic sensing and control equipment as well as two computers
running Linux and software specifically designed for the AUVSI
contest. Over the four years CU has entered this contest, Robocar
has changed significantly. This article documents the various
systems of Robocar in this year's incarnation, its software
architecture and navigation algorithms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22d9608"></a>The Mechanics</h2></div></div><p>The basic frame of Robocar is a kid's vehicle, hacked
apart&mdash;the kind of toy one or two children can sit in and drive. We
ripped out the wimpy motors that came with the original toy and
replaced them with big, beefy ones with chains and gearing to
improve drive power. We substituted computer controls for the
steering wheel and pedals and augmented its body structure. Not
much remains of the original vehicle except some framework and the
outer plastic shell.</p><p>An inverted metal &ldquo;U&rdquo; was welded to the car body above the
former location of the windshield and two cameras were mounted to
it. The original windshield was not used because it was too low to
the ground and did not provide a large enough field of view. A
metal box used for housing various circuits is also attached to the
metal &ldquo;U&rdquo;.</p><p>Batteries fit snugly into the former seating area of the
vehicle. Covering the batteries is a wooden board which holds the
competition load. Likewise, a wooden platform has been added to the
back of the car to carry our main computer, a conventional desktop
machine with a big monitor. Additional equipment, including our
smaller second computer, is stashed under the hood in place of the
original battery.</p><p>Overall, the car measures 30 inches wide, 54 inches long and
62 inches high and weighs in excess of 200 pounds. Actually, the
car's body has become a huge, heavy hack after three years of
adding features. We'll probably rebuild it from scratch next year
using lighter materials.</p><p>Robocar must withstand a fair amount of stress while
traveling across the bumpy course (grass, sand, simulated pavement,
wooden ramps). Vibrations need to be dampened to get clean, useful
video&mdash;try driving down the road while looking through a jiggling
video camera some time, and you'll get a fair approximation of
Robocar's vision of the world. Besides, we don't want the hard
drives bouncing around all over the place; therefore, all four
wheels have shocks to help reduce the vibrations, and our
mechanically fragile equipment is mounted on foam.</p><p>Finally, we replaced the slippery, stiff plastic wheels that
came with the car with inflatable rubber tires to improve traction
on the grass and the ramps. Robocar plows right through sand traps
on these tires. Running with the tires slightly deflated helps
absorb shock.</p><p><a href="2202f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Picture of Robocar practicing.</b></span></a> At this time we
were using wall power to conserve batteries and a joystick to
manually select the motor power. It really is following the lines
by itself though. Our practice lines are impossible to miss
compared to the more subtle effects of spray paint on grass.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22d99d0"></a>The Electrical System</h2></div></div><p>This year, Robocar has large marine batteries that can easily
power it for seven or more hours of operation. The batteries are
used in pairs and power all the actuators, sensors and computers.
These are deep cycle batteries; that is, they are designed to
withstand numerous complete draining and recharging cycles. Each 12
volt battery can source 550 amps. Even though each battery lasts a
long time, we keep two spare sets on the sidelines for backup.
Unfortunately, the batteries are quite heavy&mdash;adding an extra 40
pounds each. The weight trade-off is well worth the power gain,
which should enable us to climb the ramp that caused us so much
grief in previous years.</p><p><a href="2202f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. A
close up of one of the shocks</b></span></a></p><p>We have two circuits in the car: a 12 volt circuit and a 24
volt circuit. Power for the noisy drive motors and CAN-AMP servo is
provided on a separate circuit from the digital devices. Relays
switch the drive motors from forward to reverse as well as cut
power to the motors in emergencies. The diagram of the electrical
system provides more information.</p><p>If Robocar should ever go wildly out of control, a quick slap
on one of the two emergency stop buttons (one of which is a remote
control) will quickly bring it to a halt by disconnecting the
motors from the batteries. Even though the car is moving at a mere
5 miles an hour or less, it can still do a lot of damage to objects
and people. I have scars to prove it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22d9c90"></a>Actuators</h2></div></div><p>Every robot relies on actuators to act upon its world.
Robocar has three of these:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Steering control is provided via a CAN-AMP. The
steering CAN-AMP is one of three nodes on our CAN (Controller Area
Network). The other two are an encoder wheel and the CAN-PC
controller card. Servo behavior can be completely controlled; for
example, we can tell it to turn a certain distance within a certain
period of time and to decelerate gently before it gets there. Two
years ago, we used one of these to turn a single camera rapidly
from side to side without damage, because of the great number and
flexibility of the parameters to the CAN servo.</p></li><li><p>Motor control is achieved through pulse width
modulation (PWM) from a computer to two DC drive motors. These 24
volt motors are extremely powerful and have great torque. One
afternoon, we took turns riding on the car, and the motors easily
pulled the car and a heavy (185 pound) human passenger up a steep
hill. We generate a PWM signal from two cascading counter/timers
that receive the same clock signal. The first is set up to
periodically generate a rising edge on its output and determines
the frequency of the PWM signal. The period of the signal does not
change. The output of the first counter/timer is connected to the
gate on the second counter/timer. The second counter/timer
determines the duty cycle of the PWM signal. A short count on this
timer maps to a longer fraction of the PWM period that is high and,
thus, to more power being sent to the motor.</p></li><li><p>Shadow-reducing head lamps are switched with a
computer-controlled relay. These lights improve the vision sensors'
ability to spot the course boundaries.</p></li></ol></div><p><a href="2202f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. A
nasty bird nest which also serves as the wiring for
Robocar</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22da108"></a>Sensors</h2></div></div><p>To perceive its environment, Robocar needs sensors. We have
given it cameras for detecting the track boundary lines painted in
the grass, a scanning sonar for obstacle avoidance and an encoder
wheel for speed detection. Robocar has some additional sensors for
side projects which are not used during the competition.</p><p>Vision is supplied from two standard video cameras fed
through two Matrox Meteor frame grabbers. We have two different
Matrox cards: the Meteor and the Meteor/RGB. Both can read from
multiple cameras and grab high-resolution 24-bit color images. The
only difference is that the Meteor/RGB can grab frames from a
split-RGB source, whereas the regular Meteor cannot. Even though we
could plug two cameras into a single Meteor board, we are using two
boards to get 30 frames per second per camera. Matrox's Meteor
boards are inexpensive, reliable and well supported.</p><p>A single Panasonic sonar sensor mounted on top of a Futaba RC
servo acts as an obstacle detection device. It scans the area in
front of the car, rotating back and forth to cover a wider area.
Using a single sonar has the advantage of removing any possibility
of cross-talk and of being able to look in any direction. Using
multiple statically-mounted sonar sensors would not give us this
much flexibility. The Futaba servo, like the drive motors of the
vehicle, is controlled using PWM.</p><p>An encoder wheel returns data to a speed sensor indicating
how far it has turned. Since we know the diameter of the wheel, we
know how far it has turned since last we checked. Thus, this sensor
can compute our average speed during that time. The sensor's
interface to the encoder wheel is through a CAN-PC board on our
main computer. Robocar uses this sensor to ensure that it stays
under the 5 MPH speed limit.</p><p>In addition to being a competition vehicle, Robocar acts as a
test bed for Kevin Gifford's Ph.D. thesis, which is to develop an
efficient navigation algorithm for (possibly off-world) autonomous
rovers. An additional set of sensors has been added for this
option: a GPS sensor and a &ldquo;map&rdquo; sensor. Using these, Robocar
always knows exactly where it is and where it wishes to go; it can
also plan the cheapest way of getting there.</p><p>The Trimble Series 4000 uses differential GPS and can make
extremely accurate measurements&mdash;+ or - 10 centimeters&mdash;compared to
normal civilian GPS. It comes with a base station, a receiver and
radio modems. GPS information is supplied over a serial
line.</p><p>During Kevin's research, Robocar knows about its environment
by using a map sensor in addition to the competition and GPS
sensors. The map sensor is basically a topological map of the
research field. With this knowledge, Robocar can calculate the most
efficient path to a set of destination coordinates.</p><p>In addition to the above sensors, we have a joystick for
manually driving Robocar to and from the course (or around the test
field just for fun). Without this, we would have to push or carry
the heavy beast around&mdash;something we prefer to avoid. The joystick
is plugged into a generic sound card on our main machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22da478"></a>Computers</h2></div></div><p>Two networked computers provide the brains for Robocar and
the control for sensors and actuators. Debian Linux version 1.2 is
installed on both these machines.</p><p>The first of these, Highlab, is a Pentium 166MHz with 16MB of
RAM and a 1GB disk. The three boards in Highlab for sensor and
actuator control are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An ML16-P analog and digital I/O card made by
Industrial Computer Source. The ML16-P is a low-quality, low-cost
real-world interface for the ISA bus. It has sixteen 8-bit ADCs
(analog to digital converters), two 8-bit DACs (digital to analog
converters), eight digital output lines, eight digital input lines,
and three 16-bit counter timers. We use this card for PWM motor
control, e-stop, reverse and head-lamp relay toggling.</p></li><li><p>A CAN-PC card made by OmniTech for communicating to
their CAN devices (the encoder wheel for speed sensing and the big
servo for steering).</p></li><li><p>Two Matrox Meteor cards used for vision.</p></li></ol></div><p>Highlab makes the high-level decisions and controls all of
the actuators. It also performs vision and speed sensing.</p><p>Flea, the second of the two computers on Robocar, is a PC/104
stack. The PC/104 is an embeddable implementation of the common
PC/AT architecture. It consists of small (90 by 96 mm) cards which
stack together. A PC/104 uses ISA compatible hardware, although the
connectors and pin-outs are different. Any software that runs on a
regular desktop machine will also run on a PC/104. Its greatest
advantage over a desktop machine, besides its compact size, is its
greatly reduced power consumption. For more information on the
PC/104 standard, see http://www.controlled.com/pc104/</p><p>Flea consists of several modules: a motherboard (the
CoreModule/486-II from Ampro), an IDE floppy controller (the
MiniModule/FI from Ampro), a digital I/O card (the Onyx-MM from
Diamond Systems) and an Ethernet card (the MiniModule/Ethernet-II
from Ampro). It has 16MB of memory and runs with a single 20MB
solid-state IDE drive (the SDIBT-20 from Sandisk).</p><p>Since Flea has no video card, it uses a serial terminal as
its console. We needed to patch the kernel to gain this ability, as
it is not part of the normal kernel distribution. The serial
console patch can be located at
ftp://ftp.cistron.nl/pub/os/linux/kernel/patches
/v2.0/linux-2.0.20-serial-cons-kmon.diff</p><p>The Onyx-MM features 48 digital I/O lines, 3 16-bit
counter/timers, 3 PC/104 bus interrupt lines and an on-board 4MHz
clock oscillator. Flea controls the scanning sonar's servo with
this card. Sebastian Kuzminsky's Linux driver for this card can be
found at ftp://ftp.cs.colorado.edu/users/kuzminsk/</p><p>Flea's task is simple; it turns the servo, pings the sonar
and listens for the response. When it has a complete sweep of the
arc in front of the robot, it processes and sends the information
to Highlab.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x22daa50"></a>Software Architecture</h2></div></div><p>This year's software, running under the Linux OS, is
significantly improved from last year's, which ran under MS-DOS.
Although the MS-DOS system worked fine (we won third, first and
fifth place in the previous three years), it was extremely
difficult to expand, ugly and monolithic. As soon as Sebastian
finished developing Linux drivers for all our unsupported
equipment, we completely removed any and all traces of MS-DOS from
our systems and rewrote the code from scratch.</p><p>Functionality has been modularized into two types of
programs: a single arbitrator which makes the decisions and
controls the car, and sensors which provide information about the
world to the arbitrator. Sensors are derived from a skeleton sensor
and are easily created. You write the code to create a suggestion,
to interface to the hardware and to link to the sensor library. The
arbitrator and the sensors use a common configuration library which
makes it easy to parse configuration information from the command
line and configuration files.</p><p>Since the sensors and the arbitrator can run on any machine
on the Robocar network, it is simple to add and remove computers to
and from the system as needed. The arbitrator spawns sensors at
startup using <b  >rsh</b>. A simple command protocol
allows communication between the sensors and the arbitrator over
the network. The arbitrator can get and set a sensor's
configuration, get a single suggestion from a sensor, set a
sensor's suggestion rate and kill a sensor. Acknowledgments from
the sensors are necessary, since we are using unreliable UDP (User
Datagram Protocol) as our networking protocol.</p><p>Sensors generate several types of suggestions for the
arbitrator: an occupancy grid, the current speed and (for Kevin's
research only) a heading. Occupancy grids are just a way of
representing world information in a grid format. Our occupancy
grids are 6 meters wide and 3 meters high and have ten grid points
per meter. The car is centered in the middle at the bottom of the
grid. Each point of the grid can be marked with one of three
values: good (it is okay for the car to move to that spot), bad
(the car should avoid that position) and unknown. Not all sensors
provide occupancy grids; those that do are only looking for
specific types of &ldquo;badness&rdquo;&mdash;track boundaries (vision sensors)
and obstacles (sonar sensor). In the future, we will probably allow
the sensor to use weights of badness instead of a single value, so
that the arbitrator can better choose between two &ldquo;not-so-good&rdquo;
paths. Sensors send suggestions to the arbitrator as fast as they
can, at a specified rate or on demand via UDP. These are not
acknowledged by the arbitrator and can get dropped if the network
gets bogged down. This protects the arbitrator from sensors that
send suggestions too fast. Time stamps on the suggestions lets the
arbitrator know how old the suggestion is.</p><p>The user can configure and debug sensors and the arbitrator
from nice menus displayed using curses library routines. The
arbitrator itself may wish to configure the sensors; for example,
it may wish to alter the suggestion rate for a particular sensor or
to change the type of filtering done by a sensor.</p><p>After spawning the sensors, the arbitrator waits for each
sensor to connect to it and then gathers configuration information
from all of the sensors for later use and display. Finally, it
falls into a loop. Within the loop, the arbitrator selects from all
of the sensor file descriptors and standard input to gather
suggestions from the sensors and commands from the user. Using the
suggestions, the arbitrator makes a navigation decision and
actuates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x26d2fb8"></a>Navigation Algorithms</h2></div></div><p>We have several navigation algorithms to choose from and can
switch among them on the fly. However, we have found that the
simplest and easiest one works best. The Robocar needs to make only
local decisions and does not need to keep a map of its environment.
It just needs to make quick use of the data provided by its
sensors.</p><p>Rather than looking at all the sensor information separately,
the arbitrator merges the suggestions together into one total
suggestion. It then looks at the occupancy grid portion of the
total suggestion to find badness in relationship to itself. Badness
can be either a painted line or an obstacle&mdash;it doesn't really
matter to the robot which&mdash;and must be avoided. The robot looks
left, then right to find the left-most and right-most badness. It
then tries to steer between the two. If there is badness only on
one side, it tries to give the badness wide clearance&mdash;at least
half the track.</p><p>This is one of many algorithms to which we can switch, but it
seems to work well and is fairly straightforward. Kevin, of course,
uses different algorithms which take into account current and
desired position as well as surrounding terrain. Our simple
algorithm works well for the competition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21e1580.0x26d3170"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Working on the Robocar project has been a very rewarding and
exciting experience. There is nothing quite so pleasant as watching
something you have built and programmed move on its own. Switching
to Linux has allowed us to improve our robotics software and to use
our favorite development tools. We hope to do well in this year's
contest as a result. But even if we do not, we will have a good
platform for next year and will have learned a little more about
building robots and robot navigation.</p><p><a href="2202s1.html" target="_self">Contributors/Contacts</a></p><p><a href="2202s2.html" target="_self">The Robocar Team</a></p><p><a href="2202s3.html" target="_self">Robocar Race Results</a></p></div></div>
