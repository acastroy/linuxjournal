    The most reliable and cost-
    effective way for a school to get on the Internet is to use the Linux
    operating
    system with the Apache web server.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb2580.0xeaa1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Our focus this month is on Education, a
subject dear to the hearts of many Americans. Since coming into
office, President Clinton has been promising to get all U.S.
schools on the Internet, and Congress has appropriated money to
help the public schools &ldquo;get wired&rdquo;.
</p><p>The most reliable and cost- effective way for a school to get
on the Internet is to use the Linux operating system with the
Apache web server. Currently, Apache is used more than any other
available server&mdash;it just doesn't get the same publicity commercial
servers do because it is freely available. That is, no one benefits
financially from advertising it.</p><p>Our feature article, &ldquo;Holt Public Schools and Linux&rdquo;, is
about a school system that has done this very thing&mdash;networked
their computers using Linux and provided students with access to
the Internet. Linux has proved the right solution for their school
system, and it is the right solution for others, too.</p><p>Universities have been proving the reliability and
effectiveness of Linux for some time now. For this issue we
received five articles from universities, but had room for only
three. The other two will be published in future issues.</p><p>As all of these articles show, Linux works for students in
the classroom and the lab, as well as at home and in space.
Students at the University of Colorado used Linux for the
hydroponics experiment aboard the space shuttle [&ldquo;Linux Out of the
Real World&rdquo;, Sebastian Kuzminsky, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, July 1997]. This month, we have students at
that same university using Linux for robotic car races.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb2580.0xeaa4a8"></a>Fall Comdex</h2></div></div><p>As I write, Spring Comdex is being held in Atlanta, Georgia,
