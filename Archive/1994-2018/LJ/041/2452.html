    ALS was a success&mdash;everyone had fun and went home happy. Here's
    a
    report from Phil, and following it is one from an ALS attendee, Todd
    Shrider.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x2319660"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Atlanta Linux Showcase
(http://www.ale.org.showcase/) is over, and everyone is beginning
to recover. Recover, that is, from being awake too long, being on a
plane too long and stuffing more Linux than will fit into one
weekend.
</p><p>ALS was put together by the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts, the
local Linux users group in Atlanta, Georgia. The show began in the
evening on Friday, June 6 and ran through Sunday afternoon. More
than 500 people attended. The report following this one by Todd
Shrider covers much of the show, including the talks.</p><p>I want to thank Amy Ayers and Karen Bushaw for making their
photos available to us, with a special thank you to Amy for getting
them scanned and uploaded to the SSC ftp site. (Additional photos
are available on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site in
the July issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>,
http://www.ssc.com/lg/.)</p><p>I spent most of my time in the <i  >Linux Journal</i> booth giving away magazines and talking to show
attendees. One aspect that made this show special for me is the
lack of time I spent explaining to attendees that Linux is a
Unix-like operating system. Instead, I got to discuss Linux with
experienced people with thoughtful questions, letting them know in
the process how <i  >LJ</i> could help them. Each
attendee was truly interested in Linux and stopped at each booth in
the show. I expect attendees appreciated the low signal-to-noise
ratio in the booths; that is, conversations were solely about
Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x23199d0"></a>The Roast</h2></div></div><p>On Saturday night there was a roast. No, I didn't change from
a vegetarian into a meat eater overnight&mdash;we were &ldquo;roasting&rdquo;
Linus. That is, a group of people presented interesting stories
about Linus, intended to only slightly embarrass him.</p><p>In front of about 115 people, Eric Raymond, David Miller, Jon
&ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall and I got to pick on this Linus character. Topics
varied from Linus almost being hit by a car in Boston, because he
was so engrossed in talking about a particular aspect of kernel
code, to the evolution of the top-half/bottom-half concept in
interrupt handlers and why Linus was apparently moving from geekdom
to becoming a &ldquo;hunk&rdquo; sportswear model. (See the cover of the San
Jose <span   class="emphasis"><em>Metro</em></span>, May 8-14, 1997.)</p><p>Maddog finished the roasting by telling a few Helsinki
stories and showing a video that included Tove's parents talking
about Linus. A good time was had by the roasters and the audience,
and as Linus's closing comment was &ldquo;I love you all,&rdquo; we assume he
had a good time, too, and wasn't offended by our gentle
ribbing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x2319be0"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>The show came off very well. I consider this success an
amazing feat for an all-volunteer effort. The ALE members plan to
write an article for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> about how
they made this happen. We'll also make this information available
on the GLUE web site (http://www.ssc.com/glue/). I would like to
see more shows put on by user groups. The local involvement, the
enthusiasm of the attendees and the all-Linux flavor of the show
made this weekend a great experience. We are already thinking about
a Seattle or Portland show, and we would like to help others make
regional shows a reality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2221580.0x2319d40"></a>More on ALS</h2></div></div><p>by Todd M. Shrider</p><p>I first started writing this article in my hotel room late
Sunday evening (or early Monday morning) planning to get just
enough sleep that I would wake up in time to catch my plane. The
plan didn't work&mdash;I missed my 6:00 AM flight out of Atlanta. I did
the second draft while waiting for my new 9:45 AM flight. The third
draft came (yes, you guessed it) while waiting for my 1:30 PM
connection from Detroit to Dayton, also having missed the previous
connection because of my first flight's late arrival. Suffice it to
say, I'm now back home in Indiana and still enjoying the high I got
from the Atlanta Linux Showcase.</p><p>Thanks to all the sponsors and to our host, Atlanta Linux
Enthusiasts, the conference started with a bang and went off
without a hitch. The conference was a three-day event, starting
with registration on Friday and ending on Sunday with a
kernel-hacking session led by none other than Linus himself. In
between, there were numerous conferences found in both business and
technical tracks, several &ldquo;birds of a feather&rdquo; (BoF) sessions and
a floor show. These events were broken up with frequent trips to
local pubs and very little sleep.</p><p>This was my first Linux conference, and I found that an added
benefit of ALS was meeting all the people who use Linux as a
business platform and tool. (These same people tend to be doing
very cool things with Linux on the side.) From companies such as
Red Hat, Caldera, MessageNet, Cyclades, DCG Computers and others,
it was obvious that many people have very creative ways to make
money with Linux. This enterprising wasn't limited, by any means,
to the vendors. Many of the conference speakers spoke of ways to
make money with Linux or of their experiences with Linux in a
professional environment.</p><p>All of these efforts seemed to compliment the key-note
address, &ldquo;World Domination 101&rdquo;, where Linus Torvalds called for
applications, applications, applications. (Did I say he thought
Linux needed a few more useful applications?) Anyway, he pointed
out the more or less obvious fact that if Linux is going to be a
success in a world of commercial operating systems, it needs every
application type available for commercial operating systems. In
other words, if you're thinking about writing application software
for Linux, don't think&mdash;just do it. Another thing pointed out by
Linux, and which I was glad to hear echoed throughout the
conference, is the need for Linux to be easy to use. It needs to be
so easy that a secretary or corporate executive could use it as
productively as they would Windows 95. We need to make people
realize that Linux has eliminated the high learning curve usually
associated with Unix.</p><p>Don Rosenberg, while speaking on the &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; and &ldquo;what's
needed next&rdquo; of commercial Linux, said that we are now in a stage
where the innovators (that's us) and the early adopters (that's us,
as well as the people using Linux in the business world today) must
continue to push forward so that we can get another group of early
adopters (the old DOS users) to take us seriously. In Maddog's
closing remarks, he urged us all to find two DOS users, convert
them to Linux, and then tell them to do the same. Today, as a step
in this direction, I introduced a local corporate computer sales
firm to Linux; whether they take my advice remains to be seen, but
believe me, I'm pushing.</p><p>The rest of the conference was filled with business and
technical talks. The business track included such talks as Eric
Raymond's &ldquo;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&rdquo;, talks on OpenLinux by
both Jeff Farnsworth and Steve Webb, and &ldquo;Linux Connectivity for
Humans&rdquo; by none other than Phil Hughes. Lloyd Brodsky was on hand
to speak about &ldquo;Intranet Support of Collaborative Planning&rdquo;,
while Lester Hightower brought us the story of PCC and their
efforts to bring Linux to the business world. Mark Bolzern spoke of
the significance of Linux, and Bob Young talked of the
&ldquo;process&rdquo;--not the &ldquo;product&rdquo;--of Linux.</p><p>The technical track started with Richard Henderson's
discussion of the shared libraries and their function across
several architectures. Michael Maher gave a how-to of Red Hat's RPM
package management system, and Jim Paradis discussed EM86 and what
remains to be done so that one can run Intel/Linux binaries under
Alpha/Linux. David Miller then followed, giving a boost of
enthusiasm with his discussion of the tasks involved in porting
Linux to SPARC, and Miguel de Icaza took us on a trip to the world
of RAID and Linux. We convened the next day to hear David
Mandelstam discuss issues involved with wide-area networks, and to
hear Mike Warfield's anatomy of a cracker's intrusion.</p><p>All in all, the conference was a huge success. As an
improvement for next year, I might suggest more involvement from
the vendors (or maybe just more vendors), discounted prices for
conference attendees from the vendors on their special Linux wares
and a possible tutorial session, like those seen at UseLinux
(Anaheim, California, January 1997). Otherwise, a few virtual beers
(I owe you, Maddog) and lots of great geek conversation made for
one wild weekend.</p></div></div>
