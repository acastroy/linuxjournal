system that would run under Linux I came across a pair of
applications that fit my wish list very well. I needed a database
that was fast and easy to use, set up and manage. The system had to
work in an Internet/Intranet environment, support multiple users
and be vastly configurable. The cost had to be within my
budget.</p><p>I tested Empress RDBMS first. Marketed for Linux, it includes
several features that make it a clear choice for discriminating
individuals and businesses who can afford it. I then tested Just
Logic Technologies' Just logic/SQL RDBMS, a product which does not
include as many bells and whistles, but does offer core
functionality for about a third of the price of Empress.</p><p>The first thing I noticed when the Empress package arrived at
my door was 18 bound and 7 unbound (loose-leaf) manuals. This
documentation set is fully cross-referenced and includes titles for
the core server installation, server management and administration,
client utilities, 4GL application development platform, web server
interface, ODBC driver, SQL reference, GUI Builder and much more.
The manuals are printed in easy-to-read fonts with page numbers in
bold and chapter data included on every right-side page. Each
manual includes a complete index and a diagram with the entire
documentation roadmap directing attention to the order in which
manuals should be consulted. Empress gets a resounding &ldquo;A+&rdquo; for
their documentation and additional kudos for complete man pages
that complement their hard-copy documents.</p><p>Installing Empress from the installation diskettes requires
basic Unix system administration experience. While the installation
documentation is complete, the diskettes included a broken
<b  >cpio</b> command on the label. Nothing too difficult
to overcome&mdash;merely an annoyance in an otherwise outstanding
presentation. Installation of the Empress GUI Development and
Runtime requires installation of Motif (libXm) libraries and
knowledge of the path to their locations. Unfortunately, I was
unable to test this feature of the Empress product bundle as my
a.out-based Motif libraries were not recognized by the installation
program.</p><p>Dismissing the minor installation difficulties and getting to
the meat and potatoes of testing Empress left me pleased with the
package contents. Several utilities, such as the interactive SQL
interface and the dBase file import and export programs, provided
me with considerable appreciation for the talent and foresight of
the Empress development group. While every SQL interface is
&ldquo;interactive&rdquo;, Empress is truly interactive in that it is capable
of, among other things, prompting the user during table design for
specific table attributes and for related variables. This is enough
to excite even the most placid DBA. If you use the
<b  >empsql</b> interface for inserting data, it prompts
for user input and is useful as a front end for data input by
non-programmers.</p><p>Plugging Empress into my particular application required
little more than prototyping a database in Access 7.0 and using the
ODBC driver to export the tables to Empress. This worked with
numeric data types quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, the
Access text data type produces problems when exporting tables from
Access to an Empress database. I did receive a prompt reply from
Empress' e-mail support claiming that this anomaly is due to
different definitions of text data types between Access and Empress
and that Access cannot export text attributes to Empress because of
this dissimilarity. It seems to me that Empress should develop a
workaround for developers using Empress ODBC and Access for
database prototyping. Working without a text data type is not a
viable option. One solution for those DBAs using Access is to
export data from Access to a dBase or comma-delimited text file,
then import to Empress using their fine import utilities. I also
found no support for <b  >varchar</b> data types.</p><p>The first databases I built were simple tests to see how well
the Empress utilities produced desired output. Empress performed
flawlessly, and the Interactive SQL tool is a real glowing ember in
a crowded fireplace of functional components. Their
<b  >empsql</b> and supporting configuration files allows
for custom user configuration, much the same as configuring an
e-mail reader. For example, I selected <b  >joe</b> as my
SQL editor instead of the default <b  >vi</b> for
console-based edits.</p><p>Testing the speed of the database with data imported from a
combination of Empress utilities was very straightforward. I
decided that several joined tables and multiple nested queries
would provide a good performance test. Empress produced results far
above my expectations. I was suitably impressed with the raw speed
at which Empress rushed data back to the screen. A search of
810,000 records, where several calculations, conversion of data
types and summing and ordering of resultant sets was required,
completed in less than 15 minutes. By comparison, the same query on
an SQL server machine<a href="2073foot.html" target="_self">(1)</a> took
about 28 minutes.<a href="2073foot.html" target="_self">(2)</a></p><p>Incorporation of an Empress database into a web environment
is accomplished without hassle using their DataWEB package. Writing
HTML forms with Empress extensions to query the database is
straightforward for anyone with a little HTML experience. My Red
Hat 4.0 system, installed with the supplied Apache httpd server,
integrated quite nicely.</p><p>My final test, which says as much about Linux as it does
about Empress, included flipping the power switch to the off
position in the middle of a query. After several minutes of waiting
while fsck fixed my purposely distorted file system, Empress
recovered without any noted glitches. Of course, I was hoping to
crash the database to test the on-line backup utility, but it would
not crash. I didn't get mad&mdash;I got even. I deleted the database,
and it restored quickly and without incident. I was ready to query
once more.</p><p>Empress also includes a report writer that I was unable to
test due to scheduling limitations.</p><p>Lacking in Empress is much of what is lacking from many
commercial RDBMS products today, full SQL-92 support. A
point-and-click management tool would be nice and even recommended,
since it is standard fare with Microsoft's SQL Server. Considering
the cost of the Empress package that I tested is about $1500, it is
a bit expensive when compared to the cost of a typical Linux
distribution. However, the ease of use of its utilities and the
completeness of its documentation man pages and on-line help make
it a good choice in the professional world. It is a remarkable
product that will benefit the many Linux users who find it a
perfect fit for their needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1930580.0x1a299a0"></a>Just Logic</h2></div></div><p>The next candidate in this database duo is Just Logic/SQL. It
is compact, easy to install and use and extremely cost-effective.
Priced at $295 for an unlimited number of users, I found it to be
in a value class of its own. Many of the utilities and niceties
included in the Empress package are not found in the Just Logic/SQL
product, but it features a simple and effective SQL interface and
robust C, C++ and pre-compiler interfaces. The sqlweb interface for
putting databases on the Net is an option value-priced at
$175.</p><p>Installing Just Logic/SQL was as simple as can be. Perhaps
the most complex component for newcomers would be creating a user
account and group for the server/administrator, which is thankfully
a point-and- click operation in the Red Hat Control Panel. Since I
downloaded the trial version of Just Logic/SQL from their web site,
the documentation was in Adobe PDF files, which require an
appropriate reader before beginning installation. I liked the
searchable PDF files.</p><p>JTL comes with a test database and a warning that it may take
a few minutes to install depending on your hardware. The sample
databases are included in three different formats, each serving as
learning examples of how to use the C, C++ and pre-compiler
interfaces. I chose the C version, which installed a small database
in less than two minutes. I assume the warning must be a holdover
for 386 Linux users. I tried the same file on a 486-66 with 32MB
and a Seagate fast SCSI-2 hard drive on a 16-bit Future Domain
controller, and it took approximately three minutes, certainly not
as long or as involved as compiling a kernel. You can probably
safely ignore the warning if you are currently driving any hardware
combination built after the Reagan administration.</p><p>The documentation provides a simplistic schema for the
&ldquo;abc&rdquo; sample database. Something everyone can appreciate is
database guru Joe Celkos' naming conventions&mdash;table names are
plural and in uppercase, attributes are singular and lowercase. The
Just Logic/SQL sample mixes conventions just enough to be annoying,
but this is rather common in an area where MS-Access-based converts
excel (pun intended).</p><p>During testing this product performed very well. Using the
same 810,000 record database and query, it brought back answers in
just under 13 minutes. However, the slight difference in
performance is less significant when compared with the time it took
to get the data into the package. While Empress import utilities
handled things in just a few minutes, I spent about 45 minutes
writing a C program to import the data into Just Logic/SQL. Just
Logic/SQL supports <b  >varchar</b> data types.</p><p>Using Just Logic/SQL in a web environment was another
exercise in simplicity. Installation and setup are a matter of
copying the executable into your cgi-bin directory and editing a
sample configuration file with your system details. The executable
must set UID to the database owner, which is accomplished easily
with the documented commands. The <b  >sqlweb</b>
documentation is clear and concise. Creating HTML pages for
database access using <b  >sqlweb</b> is well-defined
with complete examples in the sqlweb.pdf. I was able to access data
from the Linux/Just Logic/SQL/Apache combination from my Linux
Netscape browser within minutes. It is quite exciting to see how
fast it works. I spent several hours writing complex queries and
HTML forms pages to see if I could break it.</p><p>Just Logic/SQL is perfect for low-budget shops who need a
relational database solution. Students and professionals will
appreciate it for its simplicity and robustness. The SQL, web, C,
C++ and pre-compiler interfaces offer enough choices that anyone
can immediately begin using the product to store and manage data
resources. I heartily recommend it for anyone with some programming
experience. The many examples of coding provided on the Just
Logic/SQL web site is a fine starting point.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1930580.0x1a20650"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The bottom line in choosing between these two Linux database
packages is one of cost versus time and user programming
capability. Both packages offer programmers the flexibility to do
just about anything they wish with their respective systems. Both
provide data control, manipulation and administration. Both are
performance-oriented and presented no problems as delivered. Both
worked well in networked environments; however, I was unable to
test either of them in a busy multiuser setting. The only thing I
would want from either package is conformance to the SQL-92
standard, although both currently claim SQL-89 conformance. Both
vendors have substantial quantities of information available on
their web sites. I found both of these packages surprisingly supple
and responsive, easy to install, configure and run on Linux with
basic Unix skills. I think you will, too.</p><p><a href="2073s1.html" target="_self">Test Platform</a></p><p><a href="2073s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
