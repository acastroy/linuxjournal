find an application similar to Microsoft Access. Instead I found
more &ldquo;and&rdquo; less. Solid Server has more raw &ldquo;horsepower&rdquo;. It is
a race-ready engine waiting for a chassis. I discovered that Solid
Server ships without the chassis. The task of &ldquo;chassis building&rdquo;
(application development) is left up to the programmer. Solid
Server's adaptability makes it easy to integrate into the
customer's &ldquo;chassis&rdquo;. The end result is a database application
that is capable of taking on the competition and winning.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2326f1.jpg"></div><p>In the process of reviewing Solid Server, my understanding of
database technology changed as my level of knowledge elevated. I
quickly realized I was dealing with a product possessing
capabilities beyond my experience. Thanks to SSC's
info@linuxjournal.com, I was able to recruit Rob Wehrli to help
validate SQL standards and some of the technical aspects of the
review. This review is the product of our e-mail collaboration
across the Pacific. The screen-shots are from an interface
application Rob is using with Solid Server.</p><p>Solid Server for Linux 2.2 is powerful, extensible and
extremely capable of serving database requirements ranging from a
simple desktop application to a corporation-wide business
integration. The combination of Solid Server's file handling
capabilities (which reportedly extend into the 30TB range),
multiple platform availability and extensive communication protocol
suite makes Solid Server 2.2 an intelligent choice for a wide range
of applications. I was unable to test the 30TB claim and networking
capabilities because of my limited resources; however, judging from
the list of companies using Solid Server, I am inclined to agree
with these claims.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2326f2.jpg"></div><p>There is strength in numbers. Solid has ported its server to
Linux and at least seven other popular platforms. Their installed
base reads like a &ldquo;Who's Who&rdquo; in the global marketplace, giving
one the feeling that this product is the proverbial &ldquo;better mouse
trap&rdquo;. Names like Nokia, CompuWare and Tallahassee, Florida's
Department of Highway Safety and Department of Motor Vehicles
appear on their roster. Deutsche Telekomm, a major German
telecommunications company, has purchased a large number of Solid
licenses specifically for Linux. Solid Server is even embedded in
Kone Elevator's control systems. Many of Solid's business customers
and strategic partners have WWW sites, making it easy to gather
references and additional information about the product. Kone
Elevators maintains a web site at http://www.kone.com/ containing
more information about their products and EleVision, their
integration of Solid Server.</p><p>Communication is the heart and soul of Solid Server. For
example, a database created on an NT platform can be moved, without
conversion, to a Solid Server running on a Linux platform.
Furthermore, the same database can be accessed by one or more
client applications simultaneously, via any of seven common
protocols, over a network or on one machine. The login screen-shot
displays a simple interface to a networked database. Solid reports
compliance with Entry Level SQL2 syntax, significant features from
Intermediate Level SQL2, SAG CLI standards. The API also features
16 and 32-bit ODBC drivers and Solid's own SA interface, giving the
customer the added flexibility to integrate Solid Server within
existing structures with minimal conversion. The query screen shot
shows the SQL instructions used to extract the data shown in the
result set example.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2326f3.jpg"></div><p>Data integrity is only as good as the steps taken to preserve
it. Solid Server accomplishes this task using automated backup,
concurrent logging and check points. Few applications can recover
from a surprise shutdown, but Solid Server lost nothing during my
testing. It is safe to say a stand-alone installation of Solid
Server will survive most, if not all, system surprises. My system
logs reported all of the recoveries as successful. Furthermore, the
recovery process was so quick I hardly had time to read the extra
line displayed.</p><p>This game belongs to the quick&mdash;Solid Server is fast. On a
Pentium 75 with 20MB of RAM, it processed my small examples
instantaneously. There was no appreciable degradation in
performance as I added more and more information to the database.
My test bed is humble by today's technology standards, but Solid
Server performed beyond my expectations. It consistently returned
result sets in a matter of seconds. Rob's result set screen-shot
depicts results from a significantly larger database.</p><p>Assessing the quality of the documentation was an important
aspect of my review process. Because my idea of a database was
defined by Microsoft Access, I decided it would be wise to read
Solid's documentation. The effort paid off and I gained a better
understanding of how SQL and true relational databases work. The
books and HTML documents are written with a focus on Solid's
Windows versions. As I read the documentation, I felt I was in
familiar Windows territory, yet I was constantly translating
terminology from the Windows environment to Linux equivalents. This
is one aspect of Solid Server I would like to see improved. I
recommend moving the referenced README files to the printed and
HTML pages, merging them into the context as appropriate.</p><p>If you have questions, there are several options to explore.
You can contact Solid's technical support through your local
distributor who may offer a toll-free number or e-mail address. You
can call Solid Information Technologies, Ltd. in Helsinki, Finland,
or send an e-mail to their headquarters tech support. Solid does
not offer a toll-free number. I sent e-mail directly to Solid on
two occasions and received answers within 24 hours each
time.</p><p>Solid Server 2.2 is value priced. The extensive list of
features and capabilities give the Solid Server consumer an
excellent return on his investment. Priced at three levels&mdash;$99 US
per single user, $199 US per seat for multiuser and $495 US per
server with Web- enabling option&mdash;this RDBMS is affordable for
small businesses and large corporations alike.</p><p>Solid's decision to port to Linux complements the growing
number of professional mainstream products that make Linux a
respected contender for mission-critical business requirements.
This is a tremendous benefit to the Linux community. It reinforces
the value of Linux in the global market and generates renewed
interest in applying Linux in place of other more costly operating
systems. Solid Server's open platform architecture is making it
easier. The informed purchase decision can no longer be based
entirely on &ldquo;which&rdquo; RDBMS product to buy, but must also consider
on which platform it will be used. Given Linux's return on
investment, one begins to lean toward &ldquo;free&rdquo; Linux. Solid Server
2.2 raises the bar for competing RDBMS producers and demonstrates a
strong commitment to Linux as a world-class operating
system.</p><p>I give Solid Server for Linux v.2.2 a &ldquo;solid&rdquo; two thumbs
up.</p></div></div>
