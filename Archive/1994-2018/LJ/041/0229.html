    One company's experience using Linux as the operating system of
    choice for their training classes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245d3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The proliferation of the Linux operating
system has done much to stimulate the interests and activities of
hobbyists around the globe. Many developers and users are taking
advantage of this freely available, 32-bit wonder, as a viable home
alternative to a commercial Unix platform. With a multitude of
Linux enthusiasts active in key positions the industry, it was only
a matter of time before Linux also became a presented solution in
the workplace. Even though Linux sports some of the more advanced
and innovative mechanisms available, only recently have many
organizations begun to accept Linux as a solution for production
projects.
</p><p>My employer, Decision Consultants, Incorporated (DCI), is one
of the nation's largest software services consulting firms. I am a
technical instructor in our Training Division, which is responsible
for creating, packaging and implementing technical training
solutions to both our consultant base and external clients. A large
portion of this training revolves around Unix-based client/server
development. We needed a versatile, flexible training room, capable
of facilitating our entire repertoire of Unix-based courses, from
Unix Essentials to X/Motif Development. This formula, once
successfully implemented, would need to be &ldquo;cloned&rdquo; for our other
branch offices around the country. In this article, we will examine
certain portions of that solution, as well as present an action
plan for implementing your own Linux solutions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245d500"></a>Overview of Requirements</h2></div></div><p>The first step in any major endeavor is to formulate a plan
of action which will ultimately lead you to your goal. Our plan of
action first involved the creation of a list of all the major
lab-based, Unix-related courses which would need to be delivered in
the training facility. They included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Unix Essentials</p></li><li><p>Advanced Unix/Shell Programming</p></li><li><p>C Programming</p></li><li><p>X Windows and Motif Development</p></li><li><p>Unix Internals/Systems Programming</p></li><li><p>Networking with TCP/IP</p></li></ul></div><p>After the list was created, it was analyzed further to create
a list of the tools and host-level resources which would be needed.
Of course, all of the classes would require an operating system, a
properly configured TCP/IP setup to provide student connectivity
and a working Unix shell. A stable C compiler would fit in nicely
with the C Programming course, and a feature-packed X server would
be needed for the X Windows development course. Another concern was
Motif which is available in many forms these days.</p><p>Once this list was created, a platform had to be chosen.
Given pricing structures of major vendors, such as Sun, HP, DEC,
etc., Linux was the clear winner. We could spend several thousand
dollars for the latest and greatest version of one of the popular
vendor offerings or a mere twenty bucks for a recent Linux
distribution on CD-ROM. The choice was not a difficult one to
make.</p><p>However, the choice of Linux was not based on price alone. As
you are probably aware, all of our requirements (with the exception
of Motif) have been readily available on most Linux distribution
CD-ROMs for quite some time. A number of other nice tools, such as
TCP/IP, NFS and a full suite of developer tools, would have cost
extra with most commercial vendors. Several inexpensive,
Linux-specific versions of Motif are available, such as SWiM, Metro
Motif, Mootif and Moteeth.</p><p>The total cost for the host-side software load totaled
somewhere in the neighborhood of 120 dollars (20 for the Linux CD
and around 100 dollars for the X11R6 version of SWiM for Linux).
That cost is roughly equivalent to the sales tax you would incur
when purchasing a major vendor's bundle.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245dbe0"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>A typical DCI training room consists of eight student
workstations connected to a single host machine on an isolated
Ethernet bus. The host machine should have the capability to handle
at least eight TELNET sessions or, in the case of our more advanced
courses, up to eight X Window sessions. The following is a
breakdown of a typical DCI training host:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>90MHz or better Pentium processor</p></li><li><p>16 to 32MB of RAM</p></li><li><p>Adaptec 1542CF SCSI controller (ISA-based
card)</p></li><li><p>1GB (or better) SCSI drive</p></li><li><p>Standard issue SCSI CD-ROM unit</p></li><li><p>Streaming SCSI DAT drive</p></li><li><p>Generic NE-2000 compatible network interface card
(NIC)</p></li><li><p>Number 9 Trio64 (S3 chip set) video card (2MB RAM
on board)</p></li><li><p>Low-end, LaserJet-compatible printer</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245e370"></a>The Processor</h2></div></div><p>Our original prototype training room uses a stock 60MHz
Pentium processor in its host machine, although newer training
rooms are coming on-line with Pentium 90MHz processors or better.
There is a huge difference in processing speed between the older
Pentium 60 models and the newer Pentium 90 units, although I have
had great success with both systems. If you are still hesitant
about obtaining a Pentium machine, a 486DX/100 unit will provide
comparable performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245e478"></a>Memory</h2></div></div><p>For most training classes including X Windows and Motif, 16MB
is adequate. Of course, greater performance can be obtained by
simply upgrading to 32MB of RAM on the host. I recommend getting
the full 32MB of RAM initially, rather than purchasing it later.
While our MIS department has been quite accommodating to our
hardware requests, your organization may not be as generous. If you
have corporate red tape to cut through, request the 32MB up
front.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245e580"></a>The SCSI Controller</h2></div></div><p>We currently use the Adaptec 1542CF SCSI controllers. These
are ISA-based cards which have been stable under Linux for quite
some time. I have experimented with the Adaptec 2940 PCI-based
controller, but it was a bit too squirrelly for my tastes. Even
though the 1542 units are 16-bit ISA cards, my aim was stability
first and foremost. A few other cards which I can personally attest
to are the Future Domain 1680 series and the older Always IN-2000
cards.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245e688"></a>The Hard Disk</h2></div></div><p>Our first training room used an older 500MB IDE drive. While
it served admirably and reliably, it also reached maximum capacity
in a hurry. For a full install of Linux, complete with XFree86, I
allow a liberal 200MB or so. However, some other storage
requirements must be taken into consideration during the planning
phase. For instance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Motif&mdash;With the newer X11R6 distributions of SWiM,
roughly 30MB of storage is needed for a full install from
CD.</p></li><li><p>Student lab work&mdash;Plenty of storage must be set
aside for student lab work. Some courses, such as the Shell
Programming course, don't require much storage for student lab
work. Other courses, like our X/Motif Development course, require
quite a bit. For 8 students, I recommend having around 20MB or so
available per student for their course work.</p></li><li><p>Linux kernels&mdash;If you plan on experimenting with
newer revisions of the Linux kernel, plan on having a lot of extra
room. I recommend having 20MB or so per revision.</p></li><li><p>Temporary storage&mdash;Plan on setting aside a liberal
amount of storage for temporary files (i.e., the /tmp directory).
In fact, I recommend that you make this directory a separate file
system altogether. I like to have 100-200MB available for a typical
temporary storage area.</p></li><li><p>WWW storage&mdash;We run an internal training Web,
complete with on-line prep tests for our students. I must point out
that even the smallest working Web requires a good bit of storage.
We currently have around 20MB or so of web information on-line
(including the web server software and our image library).</p></li><li><p>Working storage&mdash;Of course, we need plenty of room
to sock away on-line course materials (completed solutions to lab
work, shell scripts, etc). In addition, our instructors do quite a
bit of development and experimentation as well, so that must be
taken into account as well. A few hundred megabytes will work
nicely.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x245ec08"></a>The CD-ROM Unit</h2></div></div><p>Of course, any good Linux system needs a CD-ROM unit
attached. With most software packages shipping on CD-ROM these days
(including Linux), it pays to have one of these drives in place.
Should disaster strike, it's much easier to reload the base
operating system from CD-ROM, rather than a tape backup unit. I
have had great success with several models from NEC, Sony and
Sanyo. Try to stay away from proprietary SCSI interfaces, such as
come with some Compaq CD-ROM drives. That old single-spin, wonder
unit in the attic may make a perfect candidate for this job, since
it won't be used all the time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24555a0"></a>Streaming SCSI DAT Drive</h2></div></div><p>These wonderful devices make perfect solutions for backups.
These drives are so fast and quiet that I have actually performed
system backups while a class was in session. Any major brand should
work nicely, although I can personally attest to the 2GB and 4GB
models from Colorado. Even if you have to perform backups on an
older 120/250MB Colorado Jumbo, the issue of system and working
backups should be addressed swiftly and immediately.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24556a8"></a>The Network Interface Card</h2></div></div><p>For connectivity, a generic NE-2000 compatible card works
rather nicely. I have had good experiences with 3COM 3C509 cards,
as well as the Intel Etherexpress cards. If you are setting up a
full network, be sure to purchase network cards which match any
existing or planned wall connections. Don't run out and save a
bundle on a rack of AUI-based cards, if you have twisted pair
connections in the wall already.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24557b0"></a>The Video Card</h2></div></div><p>We use and recommend the Trio64, S3-based cards from Number
9. These cards have proven to be quite reliable and versatile under
X Windows. This is a tricky area, due to the fact that XFree86 only
supports cards with certain chip sets. Other good choices include
cards sporting a Tseng-4000-based chip set.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24558b8"></a>The Printer</h2></div></div><p>Our students are not in the graphic design business, nor are
we. A low-end, LaserJet-compatible unit works nicely for source
code printing and other small jobs. In fact, even a low-end printer
can generally support postscript or PCL raw formats, so working
with programs like ghostscript and TeX can be facilitated easily. I
think our printers are coming on-line at around $400 per unit&mdash;not
bad.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24559c0"></a>Back to Business</h2></div></div><p>While installing, configuring and maintaining our Linux host
machines can be somewhat time consuming, the same procedures, when
performed on our student workstations, take considerably less time.
Depending on which training branch you visit, our student
workstations range from older 486/33 machines to newer Pentium 90
desktop models. For a simple TELNET connection, even older XT/AT or
286 machine is capable of running NCSA's freely available
implementation of TELNET.</p><p>For X Windows and Motif development, a more robust platform
is required. Most of our workstations have around 500MB of storage
and 8 to 16MB of RAM. DCI is an Authorized Microsoft Technical
Education Center (ATEC). As such, we also instruct a number of
non-Unix related courses, such as Windows NT development. These
courses require considerably more resources on the workstation
side. The only common denominator is really the network cards used
in the workstations, which are also of the NE-2000 variety.</p><p>As far as workstation tools go, we use the following software
packages on each of our workstations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NCSA's TELNET Package has truly been a gift from
the heavens. It has performed reliably over a sustained time period
and is quite configurable on the workstation side. With it, our
students are able to maintain multiple TELNET sessions, as well as
the occasional FTP to the host to upload their lab work.</p></li><li><p>X/Appeal from Xtreme S.A.S. (Italy) is a
remarkable, surprisingly inexpensive X Server for DOS. It supports
a number of different video chip sets, as well network
configurations. A 30 day trial version of X/Appeal can be obtained
at ftp://oak.oakland.edu/.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft Windows for Workgroups v3.11? In a
Unix-based training room? Surprised? Not at all. One of the nice
things about our setup, is that we use the freely available Samba
package to allow Linux to provide shared directory and printer
services to our DOS/Windows based workstations. The bulky Windows
products used in some of our other courses (PowerBuilder, Visual
Basic, Visual C++, etc.) can be installed directly onto the Linux
host, freeing up valuable disk storage on the workstations. In
fact, we even share the CD-ROM which is installed on the host
machine. The student workstations can then access the CD-ROM at any
time.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2455de0"></a>Benefits/Drawbacks</h2></div></div><p>While there are a number of advantages to using Linux as a
training solution, a number of drawbacks also manifest themselves
over time. Do the benefits outweigh the drawbacks? I'll let you be
the judge.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2455ee8"></a>The Price of the Operating System</h2></div></div><p>Free. End of story. As mentioned earlier, the price of a
stable Linux distribution on CD-ROM is exponentially cheaper than
obtaining a commercial solution, such as SCO or Unixware. In fact,
with the extra cash you have left over, you can afford to subscribe
to Infomagic's quarterly Developer's Resource 4 CD set for the rest
of your life.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2455ff0"></a>The Price of the Hardware</h2></div></div><p>With PC-based hardware prices falling, you can pick up an
adequate host machine for under $4,000. Compare that to the 5-digit
price of a proprietary architecture, such as an IBM RISC machine or
a Sun SPARC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24560f8"></a>The Price of Tools and Add on Packages</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, most, if not all, Linux distributions
ship with a multitude of packages which would cost you extra from
some commercial vendors. A third party Motif derivative for Linux
runs far less than the asking price from OSF. In fact, one of the
reasons that I became involved with Linux was the steep-pricing
structure issued by SCO. I am a former employee of a SCO VAR,
reseller and software development house. I decided that I would
purchase SCO for myself and run it at home on one of my spare
machines. I laid out $1,500 just for the base operating system,
only to discover that to add TCP/IP and the Developer Kit another
$1,500 would be in order&mdash;not for me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2456200"></a>Lack of Technical Support</h2></div></div><p>This is truly the most pressing battle you may need to fight.
Since there is no central technical support group for Linux,
internal staff are responsible for all maintenance and support of
the system. If you don't have a true Linux fanatic around or
someone, who plans on becoming one in a hurry, you might be better
off with a commercial solution. We have two Linux mongers on our
instructor staff, with another dozen or so in our local consultant
base&mdash;works out rather nicely for us.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2456308"></a>Lack of Commercial Solutions</h2></div></div><p>Up until now, most commercial software developers and vendors
shied away from marketing Linux native tools. However, a new trend
is coming into play. Thanks to some key players in the industry
(Caldera, WordPerfect, etc.), more and more tools are becoming
available for Linux proper. I expect this trend to continue, as
more and more Linux machines appear in the workplace. In addition
to the Linux native packages which are becoming available, another
option exists. Under the freely available iBCS2 emulator, binaries
for other iBCS-supported platforms can be utilized under Linux. In
fact, we have had great success running the SCO versions of many
packages under Linux, including WordPerfect/X and Oracle 7. While a
further discussion of iBCS2 is an entire series of articles in
itself, it is something you may wish to explore further at least as
an interim solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2456410"></a>Implementing a Linux Solution</h2></div></div><p>In order to assist others in putting together a Linux
solution, I have put together a list of tips and pointers to give
you a good starting point. Some of these areas are discussed
further in the wonderful white paper by Caldera, Inc., &ldquo;Using
Linux in a Commercial Setting.&rdquo; The primary focus of your effort
is probably to convince management that a freely available OS is a
viable solution. This is rarely an easy task by any stretch of the
imagination. If you have strings in the company, plan on pulling
them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2456518"></a>Getting a Game Plan Together</h2></div></div><p>Before presenting your case to management, be sure to have a
game plan in order. Don't jump up and shout &ldquo;Let's run Linux.&rdquo; at
the first project meeting. Corporate ties with commercial solution
providers often run deep, so be careful. Put together a detailed
implementation plan, complete with a cost savings analysis and time
schedule. There are a number of things you can do to help yourself
in this regard.</p><p>Actively research the necessary areas. Provide solid numbers
for commercial solutions. Be sure that you have accommodated all
aspects of the project within your proposal. Make sure that all
issues of connectivity and software facilitation have been
addressed. Think of it as a legal battle&mdash;leave no loopholes in
your argument.</p><p>Obtain and maintain high-level contacts in the industry. Meet
with other folks who have successfully implemented a Linux
solution. They may be able to provide additional insight into your
argument. Planning on running the latest and greatest version of
&ldquo;product X&rdquo; under Linux? Chances are, someone else has already
driven the Linux wagon down that road&mdash;investigate.</p><p>Establish a good flow of incoming information. Actively
participate in the various Linux newsgroups. They are a wonderful
resource for obtaining contacts and production information.
Subscribe to <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Helpful articles
and vendor information are in abundance with each issue.</p><p>Hardware integration&mdash;make sure that your proposed hardware
will function once its all together on-line. If you can't do it
yourself beforehand, try to find someone who has. The worst thing
in the world is to win the battle with management and run into
hardware issues which require additional purchases to patch a
problem that you didn't foresee.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x24567d8"></a>Presenting your Solution</h2></div></div><p>Once a solid proposal has been constructed, present your
case. Try to leave a solid impression of Linux with your attendees.
Some key Linux points to hit on include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>POSIX compliance</p></li><li><p>32-bit architecture</p></li><li><p>Cost savings</p></li><li><p>Availability of tools and software solutions</p></li><li><p>Network capabilities (TCP/IP, IPX, AX.25,
etc.)</p></li></ul></div><p>Unfortunately, most folks still perceive Linux as a toy. In
your presentation, be sure to point out the efforts of major
industry players, such as Caldera and WordPerfect. Let them know
that Linux is quite capable of providing a solid solution for your
organization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2365580.0x2456d00"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Linux is a viable solution platform. Our nationwide network
of training centers is a living testament to that statement. With
the proper direction, its proliferation in the workplace can
continue on an upward trend. The Linux operating system reminds me
of an expansion baseball team. It has a lot of fans, but nowhere
near the fan base of an established and proven team. It is young
and full of promise, and one day, just maybe, it will win the
pennant.</p></div></div>
