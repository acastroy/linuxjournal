    Linux is being recognized as a serious OS with real commercial
    potential.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29aa580.0x2aa2298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Each month we allocate a page for this
column. The space is reserved past the regular deadline to give us
an extra week to find the right earth-shattering event to
report&mdash;which sometimes doesn't happen. This month we missed the
initial deadline and were left with about a day to find some
earth-shattering news and write the column.
</p><p>Back in the early days of Linux there was a new kernel almost
every day, which produced a continuous stream of new topics. Linux
has grown up&mdash;it's too stable, reliable and routine.</p><p>Or is it? I went to the comp.os.linux.announce newsgroup
hoping to find an exciting event. I didn't. I read it again. Still
no exciting event. Then, I realized I was so busy looking for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> thing that I had missed an event of more
significance than any single post.</p><p>Linux is being recognized as a serious OS with real
commercial potential. It's not that we haven't had anything
commercial posted before, it is that there were so many posted in
the last week and the type of information posted. Here is a
sample:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Process credit cards on your
computer</b></span>: Credit Card Verification System (CCVS) from
HKS, Inc. is a package that gives you a command line interface and
GUI to do credit card processing as well as libraries to call from
programs.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>WebMagick Image Web Generator
1.29</b></span>: WebMagick is a package which makes putting images
on the Web as easy as magic. Or, more specifically, WebMagick
builds HTML pages and image maps from a set of image files. Thus,
rather than manually building a page using thumbnails and writing
HTML so the thumbnails are clickable, WebMagick builds maps
consisting of the thumbnails and writes the HTML. Besides saving
you time, WebMagick improves performance by decreasing the number
of individual files that make up a clickable page.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linux nominated for a
European Software Excellence Award</b></span>: These awards are
sponsored by Ziff-Davis, Europe's largest computer magazine
publisher. The three finalists for the Desktop Environment Award
were Microsoft, IBM and Red Hat Software. They said: &ldquo;... Linux
has grown up from being a programming freak's playground to a
stable and easy to install operating system. ...&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Web-based application
development platform</b></span>: TalentSoft Web+ 3.0 is a premier
web-based application development platform for Unix and Windows.
The article states &ldquo;Web+ is extremely scalable, having been tested
successfully on a web site with an average of 2,000,000 hits/day,
40% of which are hits to the Web+ server.&rdquo; Now, the posting didn't
say it was a Linux box that handled the 2,000,000 hits per day, but
the product is available for Linux&mdash;the limitation is the hardware,
not the software.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>VBVM&mdash;A Visual Basic 5
Virtual Machine</b></span>: This product from Softworks Limited is
a portable version of the MS Visual Basic 5 virtual machine. It
enables you to take VB5 executables and run them, unmodified, on
other platforms. While not an application, it will make it possible
for lots of existing applications to run on Linux.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rent-a-dedicated-server for
$250</b></span>: Vipex Internet Presence rents Linux servers
including DNS and an unlimited number of domains for
$250/month.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Qbib-1.1 bibliography
management system</b></span>: Herrin Software Development, Inc. had
built a bibliography management system based on
<span   class="bold"><b>qddb</b></span>. It features all sorts of
import and export options plus searching and report
generation.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Motif Interface Builder VDX
1.1</b></span>: VDX from Bredex GmbH is a GUI-based interactive
tool that generates C and C++ source code.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Regulus 1.1</b></span>:
Regulus is a package to manage customer accounts for ISPs and
includes customer activity logs and a web interface to access those
logs.</p></li></ul></div><p>This is enough of a sample of what's out there to give you
the idea. Being an old Unix hacker, I see this influx of postings
as the tool box getting filled with new, fancy tools. For example,
using Regulus and CCVS, you can quickly put together an ISP with
automated credit-card billing. Use Web+, WebMagick and a Vipex
server to build a web site.</p><p>Tie all of this together with a post about an article on
Linux in the June 1997 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Business Computer
World</em></span> that concludes that &ldquo;Linux is very solid, widely
used, and a real potential threat to Microsoft.&rdquo; It also states
&ldquo;Linux is behind in the availability of applications, but is
catching up.&rdquo;</p><p>Maybe some day STP will cover NT being replaced with
Linux.</p></div></div>
