    Auburn University uses Linux as the OS for their computer
    labs dedicated to teaching students about operating systems
    and networking.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c6e8c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article describes our experiences
installing and using a teaching laboratory based on the Linux
operating system. The lab is a platform for undergraduate operating
systems and networking education in the Department of Computer
Science and Engineering at Auburn University. We have deliberately
made the software and hardware environments of the lab quite
heterogeneous, but Linux has always been the workhorse of the lab.
Linux was chosen primarily due to the wide range of hardware
supported, the sophistication of its kernel and the availability of
source code and documentation. We believe that &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo;
experience is an essential component of computer science education
and that most current curricula rely far too heavily on simulation
when teaching systems issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c6e9d0"></a>Teaching Systems Programming</h2></div></div><p>Our primary motivation for building this laboratory was to
not shortchange our students when it comes to practical experience
with systems programming. The shortcomings we most desired to avoid
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Out-of-date technology&mdash;A good systems programming
instructor must be familiar with the state of the art, and more
importantly, the state of practice. A competent instructor should
be aware of such things as memory speeds and sizes, disk drive
performance, network standards and CPU performance. These things
change rapidly, and far too often we throw up our hands and say
&ldquo;I'll teach the fundamental concepts, but not dirty my hands with
implementation details.&rdquo; Such thinking is fundamentally flawed
when applied to systems programming, since what works and what does
not work is fundamentally based on the economics and technology
that makes some solutions viable and others not.</p></li><li><p>Too much reliance on simulation&mdash;Systems
programming is inherently a messy business. Machines can crash;
device drivers can hang the system or even the network; hardware
can be damaged by poor programming or incorrect wiring. There is a
risk that students will use the systems lab to crack other systems.
Poorly written network software can result in inadvertent denial of
service to other legitimate users of the network.</p></li><li><p>All these things make a dedicated systems
laboratory very difficult to accommodate in today's typical
university computing environment of networked Windows PCs and
commercial Unix workstations. Systems administrators don't want to
put at risk a part of their network which is, almost by definition,
broken most of the time.</p></li><li><p>Thus, systems programming courses often rely
exclusively on the use of simulators to provide students with some
experience in systems programming. The problem with this approach
is that the real world is not running on a simulator. Simulation
adds an extra layer of complexity that must be grasped by the
novice, and also insulates the novice from the fact that
development tools may be primitive or nonexistent and the designer
is often responsible for building the design tools as well.
Students need to learn to build their own tools, to leverage the
capabilities they have in order to achieve the ends they need when
developing new systems.</p></li><li><p>Aversion to team exercises&mdash;We in the computer
science and engineering department at Auburn often ask our
industrial contacts, &ldquo;What should we be teaching our students to
prepare them for work at your firm?&rdquo; Inevitably, we are told that
the important skills include teamwork and experience with large
systems. Because of the difficulties inherent in assessing team
performance and in managing the interpersonal issues involved with
team-based projects, most university exercises tend to be
individual activities based on small, or even toy systems. Perhaps
the underlying obstacle may be an unwillingness to depart from the
traditional lecture-and-examination method of teaching. Professors
have a term that is generally used to refer to team
work&mdash;cheating.</p></li><li><p>Security concerns&mdash;It is a fact of life that not
all university students can be trusted in the same ways that
employees are trusted. As mentioned above, some protections must be
set up so that hacking does not interfere with the work of other
students or with that of university staff. Further, physical
precautions must be taken against the theft of equipment available
for public use. Unfortunately, these concerns seem directly aimed
at frustrating any attempt to provide students with &ldquo;real&rdquo;
systems programming experience, for which they may need root
privileges, and for which they will often need access to the inside
of the machine.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="2361f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1.</a></p><p>A dedicated laboratory for systems programming courses,
running Linux on commodity hardware, isolated to some extent from
the main campus network, seemed to us to be a good way around most
of these shortcomings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c6f058"></a>Lab Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The lab began in the late summer of 1995 with six Pentium 90
machines running Red Hat Linux version 1.0. We made an effort to
buy only hardware that supported Linux: IDE disk drives and CD-ROM,
SCSI tape backup and file servers, ATI Mach 32 video cards, SVGA
monitors. Hardware incompatibilities caused several delays, as we
attempted to show that Linux was competitive with commercial Unix
as a platform for instructional computing. These delays seem to be
a thing of the past, both due to our increasing familiarity with
Linux and to the non-stop efforts of the Linux development
community.</p><p>The &ldquo;PC lab running Unix&rdquo; initially was regarded rather
like the dancing bear: People were impressed not that it worked
well, but that it worked at all. Faculty were amazed that we could
run essentially the same set of tools on $2000 boxes as ran on
their $4000-$8000 Unix workstations. Benchmarking and practical
experience on tasks ranging from document preparation to compiler
writing soon revealed that performance on these machines was
comparable to that achieved with workstations. Further, the fact
that all OS source code was available, and that the developers
could be contacted directly (and generally provided very helpful
advice via e-mail) were big pluses. The machines went through a
shakedown period in the fall of 1995, in which any interested
student or faculty was granted access, but the machines were not
used as part of any formal course work.</p><p><a href="2361f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c6f268"></a>Expansion</h2></div></div><p>During the shakedown period, we attempted to attach virtually
any peripheral we could find to our Linux system and attempted to
install Linux on a variety of processors.</p><p>The initial six machine configuration was used to support a
systems administration course during the spring quarter of 1996,
with teams of about six students assigned to each machine. Students
installed Linux, configured networking, mounted file systems over
the network, installed devices, developed device drivers and made
minor kernel modifications. It was becoming clear that with more
machines, the lab could be a platform for most, if not all, of our
systems courses.</p><p>At about the same time, we scavenged a large number of 386
and 486-based machines that were being surplussed as a large
college of engineering laboratory was upgraded, and while we found
many broken computers, we were able to build somewhere between 10
and 20 working systems, all capable of running Linux. We wanted an
environment that was varied and in which hardware was plentiful (if
not always state-of-the-art). These older machines provided a
platform that could be freely used without worry about damage by
any student interested in hacking. One such project included
interfacing a color Connectix QuickCam which exported pictures of
the laboratory to the World Wide Web and to a file server, thus
providing both security and convenience at a low cost.</p><p><a href="2361f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a></p><p>Based on our preliminary results, we submitted a proposal to
the National Science Foundation (NSF) Instructional Laboratory
Improvement program to expand this lab, and to use it as our main
platform for undergraduate education in operating systems and
networks. The NSF agreed to supply $44,512 to purchase equipment,
if Auburn University would provide a matching $44,512. The total
$89,024 was allocated toward purchase of the following
items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Sixteen additional Intel-based computers</p></li><li><p>Fast Ethernet cards, cables and hubs</p></li><li><p>Network analyzers</p></li><li><p>Multimedia equipment</p></li><li><p>Printers</p></li></ul></div><p>We are currently in the process of acquiring this equipment
and developing a curriculum for introductory operating systems and
networks courses based on the Linux kernel.</p><p>For the introductory operating systems course, we currently
use the Nachos instructional operating system, developed at the
University of California at Berkeley. We start the students out
with a very limited-capability kernel and require them to extend
the scheduling, file system, process management and networking in
various ways. This OS runs on a MIPS R2/3000 processor simulator,
running on top of Solaris on a SPARCstation. We hope to remove most
of these software layers by using Linux. We plan to augment the use
of our traditional textbook, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Operating Systems
Concepts</em></span> by Galvin and Silberschatz, with a
Linux-specific text, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel
Internals</em></span>, by Beck, et al.</p><p><a href="2361f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c6fb00"></a>Systems Administration Course</h2></div></div><p>A Unix systems administration course is currently being
taught using the laboratory. On the second class day students were
required to choose a slot in a table having rows reflecting tasks
of a system administrator and columns reflecting the hardware
platforms available in the laboratory. The rows were called
&ldquo;interest groups&rdquo; and the columns were called &ldquo;teams&rdquo;. The
interest groups of the table were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Hardware group&mdash;responsible for hardware
installation, maintenance, upgrades.</p></li><li><p>Software group&mdash;responsible for software
installation, maintenance and upgrade of system software.</p></li><li><p>Network group&mdash;concentrating on networking hardware
and software.</p></li><li><p>Backup and security group&mdash;responsible for
prevention and monitoring of security for the laboratory.</p></li><li><p>Documentation group&mdash;responsible for dealing with
the maintenance of appropriate documentation of a system. The
person choosing the documentation group slot for a team was also
given the leadership roll for their team.</p></li></ul></div><p>The above-mentioned Pentium processor systems and two older
SPARC processors were the hardware platforms offered to the student
teams. Additionally, each team was allowed to choose an operating
system to manage on their machine subject to license availability.
For the Pentium processors the students were offered Solaris for
the 386 or Linux. Solaris or SPARC-Linux was available for the Sun
systems. One team expressed considerable interest in integration of
Windows NT into the laboratory, and since there was one license
available for NT, it was agreed that this team could support NT, so
long as class assignments could be performed on their
system.</p><p><a href="2361f5.jpg" target="_self">Figure 5</a></p><p>Class assignments were of three forms: user assignments, team
assignments and interest group assignments. Because each team was
to provide accounts on another team's platform, each team became a
user base for another team. Thus, individual user assignments
became team assignments. For example, a user assignment to enter an
HTML page containing a Java applet became a team assignment to
install a web server and a Java compiler on their system.</p><p>Interest group assignments were those that altered or
reconfigured the basic capabilities of the laboratory. For example,
creating two subnets in the laboratory, creating a backup system
for the laboratory machines, monitoring and securing the laboratory
were duties in which the interest groups joined together to
accomplish the assigned task.</p><p>Finally, to address distributed system management issues, all
teams were assigned the responsibility of installing, providing and
managing file and print services for the laboratory. An Iomega Jaz
drive was configured as the boot disk for the machine in the
laboratory that was to be the NFS and print server. This machine
was also configured with an additional two SCSI hard disks, a tape
drive and a printer. Each team checked out a Jaz disk and built an
operating system on its disk. The only team that had a problem
using the removable disks was the Windows NT team, which discovered
that (by design) a Microsoft Windows application cannot have page
files that reside on a removable drive.</p><p>Initially a working system was provided for the file server,
but occasionally a team's Jaz disk would become the working system
for the laboratory. If problems were discovered, the initial system
could easily restore needed services, and the team could be given
the responsibility of repairing the problem without disrupting
services. Maximum chaos could easily be achieved by assigning
problems such as the rebuilding of the kernel on the Java disk
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c66ac8"></a>Security Concerns</h2></div></div><p>Due to concerns by Auburn's Engineering Network Services
group regarding students having root access to machines connected
to the campus network, the Linux machines were isolated on a
subnet, connected to the main college of engineering network
through a secure router which knows the address of the machine
connected to each port, and routes packets only to the machine
designated to receive them. We physically secured the machines by
locking the room in which they were kept whenever no paid employee
was in the department (not necessarily in the same room), and we
routed a fiber optic cable connected to an alarm box through all
the machine cases. We soon found this cable frustrating, because it
required the assistance of the department's single systems
administrator any time a hardware change was necessary (this
occurred several times a day during the first months). In spite of
these precautions, we lost the motherboards and disk drives of two
machines to theft during that quarter. We had failed to realize
that the sort of commodity hardware used in this lab is a much more
attractive target for theft than the engineering workstations,
minicomputers and parallel machines we have traditionally used for
academic research and instruction. Further, the constant need to
access the hardware inside the PC cases meant that more
opportunities existed for the alarms to be disconnected. There
seems to be a fundamental tension in a systems lab between making
the lab a good development environment and making it secure against
a dishonest student&mdash;one simply cannot lock down every cable, nut
and bolt if any work is to get done. On the other hand, insurance
policies are difficult to obtain without evidence of adequate
security.</p><p>Our current security approach is multifold:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Fiber optic cables run through the machine
cases</p></li><li><p>A lock on each computer's case&mdash;keys are available
any time during business hours</p></li><li><p>A digital camera, connected to a 486 machine, used
to snap pictures, send them to a file server in a very secure room
and serve the latest one to the lab's web page at
http://dn102af.cse.eng.auburn.edu/~root/labimage.html</p></li><li><p>Locking the lab when none of the departmental staff
is around</p></li></ul></div><p>Any individual measure can certainly be circumvented, and of
course, a dedicated effort can defeat any security system. So far
this system seems to provide a credible theft deterrent without
interfering too heavily with productivity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b76580.0x1c66f98"></a>Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>For many of our students, their experience with our lab turns
out to be the first time they have academically dealt with the
inside of a computer. Thus, we find ourselves teaching a way of
thinking as much as the particular techniques related to the
subject matter. The commonplace tasks of debugging a system, such
as isolating a problem to hardware configuration, BIOS settings, OS
kernel or application, are new territory for beginning students.
This lab gives them the chance to gain confidence in a realistic
setting.</p><p>One criticism that students have made of our approach is,
&ldquo;The real world mainly runs Microsoft Windows&mdash;why aren't you
teaching us about that?&rdquo; While their claim is indeed valid when
one looks at market share and while any computer scientist who
claims to be well-rounded must accommodate the demands of the
market, there are significant obstacles to providing the kind of
experience we provide using commercial software. The two largest
obstacles with commercial operating systems are the lack of source
code and the lack of easily available technical support from the
software developers. A student who wants to explore the performance
differences between several different page-replacement strategies
in the file system can do so more easily with Linux and a PC than
with any other OS and computer of which we are aware.</p><p>Another lesson we learned is that with today's large disk
drives and with the use of removable cartridge hard drives, it is
possible for a number of operating systems to (more or less)
coexist on the same machine and for a wide variety of platforms to
communicate over a local network. We think this has provided our
students with a taste of the complexity of real-world systems
administration (though they will not truly know what that is like
unless we make them wear beepers and page them at all
hours).</p><p><a href="2361s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p><p>On balance, we find this Linux-based approach an improvement
over our previous methods and plan to continue it. We've had very
positive preliminary feedback from the students who have used the
lab and are looking forward to hearing whether it helps our
graduates in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
