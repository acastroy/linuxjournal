    Linux and ham radio share a common spirit of cooperation,
    experimentation and do-it-yourself attitude. These two interests come
    together
    in packet radio.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d4450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In my teens I spent many enjoyable hours
tinkering with radio equipment and communicating with other
&ldquo;hams&rdquo; around the world through the medium of amateur radio.
Moving away to attend a university and start a career and family
meant that my hobby had to go on temporary hiatus for a number of
years. Recently, I came back to the hobby and decided to explore an
area of amateur radio that didn't exist in my teen years&mdash;digital
packet radio. As an avid Linuxer, I was intrigued to see how I
could use my Linux system for packet radio. I was on a limited
budget, and wanted to get started without investing in a lot of
hardware and software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d4558"></a>What Is Ham Radio?</h2></div></div><p>Amateur radio is a pursuit enjoyed by millions of &ldquo;hams&rdquo;
around the world. By international agreement, most countries have
allocated a portion of the radio spectrum for amateurs to
experiment with radio technology. The hobby goes back to the early
days of radio and is popular with people of all ages. Operating an
amateur radio station requires an operator's license, which can be
obtained by passing an examination that covers radio theory,
regulations, operating practices and basic electronics. Full
privileges also require a knowledge of the International Morse Code
(yes, it is still used) although some countries now offer no-code
licenses that typically include restrictions in operating modes and
frequencies.</p><p>Hams are known for building their own equipment and
accessories, experimenting with new technologies and helping each
other and the public. This is close to the spirit of Linux, so it
is not surprising that many hams are also Linux users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d46b8"></a>What is Packet Radio?</h2></div></div><p>As personal computers became increasingly powerful and
affordable, amateurs looked at using radio for digital
communications. Packet radio is one such method in which text is
encoded as binary data and transmitted via radio in groups of data,
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>packets</em></span>. One popular protocol developed
for this purpose is AX.25. Based on the X.25 protocol but adapted
for the special needs of amateur radio, it offers error-free,
packet-based communication between stations. Other protocols, such
as TCP/IP, can run on top of AX.25. A few of the applications of
packet radio include chatting by keyboard with other hams in
real-time, using packet bulletin board systems, sending electronic
mail, and connecting (via gateways or worm holes) to other packet
networks or to the Internet. Data rates range from 300 bits per
second on HF (High Frequency) bands to 1200 bps on VHF (Very High
Frequency) and 9600 to 56Kbps and beyond on UHF (Ultra High)
frequencies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d4818"></a>What Kind of Packet Radio Hardware Do You
Need?</h2></div></div><p>A typical packet radio station consists of a computer or
terminal connected to a Terminal Node controller (TNC), and radio
transceiver (transmitter/receiver). A TNC is a device containing a
small microprocessor, dedicated firmware in ROM, and a modem to
convert signals back and forth between audio and serial bit
formats, and also encodes and decodes data with the AX.25 protocol.
A typical TNC connects the radio to the computer via its serial
port.</p><p>Another popular option is the &ldquo;poor man's modem-only&rdquo;
Terminal Unit (TU). It essentially has a modem chip sandwiched
between its audio and serial port connectors. Software drivers on
the computer must therefore handle all of the AX.25 protocol. It's
popular because of the price&mdash;typically one third the cost of a
TNC.</p><p>The typical DOS-based packet setup has a number of
limitations. Since the system is single user, the computer must be
dedicated to packet and cannot easily be used for other purposes.
Generally, the computer is used as a dumb terminal or dedicated
software is used that takes over the whole computer. Although some
software packages such as JNOS run on XT or AT class machines,
Linux typically runs better on a 386 machine having limited memory
than a commercial operating system alternative such as Windows
95.</p><p>Packet software is either free or distributed as shareware in
binary form. Some packages, notably JNOS, are also available as
source code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d4a28"></a>What Does Linux Offer?</h2></div></div><p>As of release 2.0, Linux has native support for the AX.25
protocol built into the kernel (a unique feature among operating
systems). For earlier releases, Alan Cox's AX25 package is easily
patched in. Furthermore, AX25 is integrated with the rest of the
Linux networking code and utilities. To Linux, a packet radio
interface appears as just another network interface, much like an
Ethernet card or serial PPP link.</p><p>The kernel contains device drivers for serial port TNCs as
well as several popular packet modem cards. It even offers a driver
that uses a sound card as a packet modem (more on that
later).</p><p>Once up and running, you can let users telnet into your Linux
system via packet radio, offer them a Unix shell or one of several
BBS programs, or even let them surf your system with a web browser.
Thanks to Linux's multiuser and multitasking capability, this
occurs without affecting the normal use of the system.</p><p>A Linux machine can act as a router to connect packet network
traffic to a LAN or Internet connection and can route e-mail via
packet. You can have multiple packet interfaces with many
simultaneous connections over each interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d4c38"></a>Back to My Story</h2></div></div><p>My first introduction to packet was using the sound card
modem driver with a hand-held 2-meter band transceiver for 1200bps
packet. The audio connects from the PC sound card to the radio's
microphone and speaker jacks. A signal from a serial or parallel
port in conjunction with a simple (one transistor) circuit is used
to control the radio's PTT (Press To Talk) circuit. This approach
requires no TNC and no packet modem&mdash;if you already have a computer
and sound card this costs almost nothing. Figure 1 shows a block
diagram of my setup.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2218f1.large.jpg"><img src="2218f1.jpg"></a></div><p>Configuring the system was straightforward&mdash;I just followed
the detailed instructions in the AX25 HOWTO. Utility programs
included with the AX25 package allow me to monitor the packets
being broadcast and received, and to call and answer other packet
stations.</p><p>I obtained an IP address from the local IP coordinator (the
44.x.x.x ampr.org Internet domain is assigned for packet radio) and
configured my system for TCP/IP over packet. All the standard
network tools then operated over packet. Assuming they are
configured for TCP/IP, I can <b  >ping</b> or
<b  >finger</b> other stations and connect to them using
<b  >telnet</b>. Similarly, I can log on to my home Linux
machine over the Internet.</p><p>Next I plan to set up a simple BBS system users can log on to
via packet radio. I'd also like to look at more sophisticated
packet networking tools supported under Linux, such as NetRom, NOS
and Rose. In the future I may even explore options for higher-speed
packet such as the 56 Kbps Ottawa PI2 card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d5058"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>As well as being fun, packet radio under Linux taught me a
lot about networking, much of which is also applicable to Ethernet,
X.25 and other network protocols.</p><p>Linux is a great platform for packet, particularly since it
is fully integrated with the rest of the networking subsystem. Its
reliability lets you leave a Linux system up for long periods of
time without crashing (ideal for a BBS environment). As an example,
one local Linux system has been on the air continuously for over
310 days without interruption. Some of the software I used was
still in alpha release yet was stable enough to use. Finally,
packet radio has opened up a whole new area of Linux for me to
explore, ensuring that I won't run out of things to do in the
foreseeable future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d51b8"></a>Acknowledgments</h2></div></div><p>Thanks go to Gord Dey, VE3PPE, for reviewing this article and
