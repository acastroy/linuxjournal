    Part 3 shows us the means to give our game simulator a more
    professional appearance and to add a few goodies.

we learned how to install XForms and began building an application
(a game theory simulator). In this final article, we spruce up our
program and look at a few XForms features that we skipped last
month. As always, source code and further information can be found
on the home page for this series at http://a42.com/~thor/xforms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21db580.0x22d35b0"></a>Review of Our Progress So Far</h2></div></div><p>If you've been following things reasonably closely, you
probably remember the general outline for constructing an
XForms-based application:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Include forms.h to access the XForms
routines</p></li><li><p>Call <b  >fl_initialize()</b> as soon as
possible</p></li><li><p>Set up your graphical interface by creating
forms</p></li><li><p>Assign actions to relevant objects by setting
callbacks</p></li><li><p>Show one or more forms</p></li><li><p>Turn control over to
<b  >fl_do_forms()</b></p></li></ol></div><p>Last month, we followed this procedure to get our basic game
theory simulator up and running. While that gave us the basic
windows we needed to be able to control and observe the underlying
simulation, there were a number of shortcomings. We had no way to
save the settings of any particular run of a game, no pull-down
menus and no pixmaps to make our program look somewhat
professional. The new version of the simulator (called xgtsim2)
adds all of these elements and includes a few other bells and
whistles that we discuss throughout this article.</p><p>The basic approach, however, has not changed. If you could
follow last month's source code, you should have no difficulty
understanding xgtsim2, even though it is a larger piece of
software. The core of the program is the same, since all we have
done is add a few more features. Extra features make a program
useful, and one of XForms's great strengths is in providing
straightforward methods for enhancing a program's usability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21db580.0x22d3c90"></a>A Look at xgtsim2</h2></div></div><p>You can find the source code for xgtsim2 in
<a href="../listings/041/2010.tgz" target="_self">Listing
1</a> on the home page, but it will save you a lot of time if
you download it from the web site. Saved as an ASCII file with the
name xgtsim.c, it compiles with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -lX11 -lforms -lm xgtsim.c -o xgtsim
</pre><p>From within the X Window System, you should be able to run
the program by entering <b  >./xgtsim2</b> in whichever
directory you compiled it in. The running program should look
something like Figure 1.</p><p><a href="2010f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Screen Shot of xgtsim2</b></span></a></p><p>As noted near the top of the source code, everything that has
been added to xgtsim2 since last month's program (i.e., the
original xgtsim) is marked by the string <b  >*NEW*</b>.
This should make it a little easier to find the segments of code we
discuss below.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21db580.0x22d40b0"></a>New Items</h2></div></div><p>The first thing to notice when xgtsim2 runs is that the
starting window (<b  >main_window</b>) is a little larger
than it was last month, and it now includes three pull-down menus
(<b  >File</b>, <b  >Settings</b> and
<b  >Help</b>). Adding these menus with XForms is quite
straightforward. If you look at the code for the
<b  >create_forms()</b> function, you'll see we have
added an <b  >FL_UP_BOX</b> to hold the menu items, then
call <b  >fl_add_menu()</b> three times. The inclusion of
the <b  >FL_UP_BOX</b> isn't strictly required, but it
does make our menu area stand out from the rest of the main
window.</p><p>In the first of the <b  >fl_add_menu()</b> calls,
we create the file menu. Note that this involves only a single
<b  >FL_OBJECT</b>, with the menu entries (e.g.,
<b  >About</b>, <b  >Load</b>, etc.) being
assigned to this object with the use of the
<b  >fl_addto_menu()</b> function. That is, we need to
assign only a single callback for the entire menu, which we do by
telling XForms we want the function
<b  >file_menu_routines()</b> to be called whenever any
entry in our <b  >File</b> menu is selected by the
user.</p><p>A little earlier in the source code, we can see that
<b  >file_menu_routines()</b> uses a call to
<b  >fl_get_menu()</b> to figure out which of the four
possible entries was actually selected. It then calls the
appropriate function. If, for example, the user selects
<b  >About</b> from the <b  >File</b> menu,
XForms knows it must execute the code included in
<b  >file_menu_routines</b>, because that's the function
we have assigned with the callback. In calling this function, it
passes the file menu object to the routine, so the call to
<b  >fl_get_menu()</b> returns a 1 (since
<b  >About</b> is menu item 1).</p><p>We use a very similar structure for the
<b  >Settings</b> and <b  >Help</b> menus,
creating a function to handle the callback for each
(<b  >settings_menu_routines()</b> and
<b  >help_menu_routines()</b>). With just a few lines of
code, we have added a fairly complete menu system to the program.
XForms does most of the hard work here, such as actually drawing
the menus when the user clicks on them, highlighting the entries
and so on. This leaves us free to focus on the underlying flow of
the program.</p><p>One common element of menu design we have not implemented is
the use of keyboard shortcuts. XForms allows for these accelerators
via the <b  >fl_set_object_shortcut()</b> function, as
well as offering mechanisms to grey out menu entries under certain
conditions, change the visual look of the menus and so on. More
information about these routines can be found in the XForms
documentation (see Resources).</p><p>Other additions to <b  >create_forms()</b> are
calls to <b  >fl_set_object_resize()</b> and
<b  >fl_set_object_gravity()</b>. The easiest way to see
what these do is to run the original xgtsim and resize the main
window with the mouse pointer. If you do this, you'll notice that
the buttons always grow at the same rate as the overall window;
make the window really big, and the buttons become enormous. It is
not very attractive, so we want to use the
<b  >gravity</b> and <b  >resize</b> parameters
to improve this behavior.</p><p>Almost all graphical elements in XForms have a default
<b  >resize</b> setting that causes them to grow in
direct proportion to the window in which they were created. We
change this behaviour in <b  >create_forms()</b> by
calling <b  >fl_set_object_resize()</b>. This function
takes two parameters: the object to which it applies and a setting
value, which can be <b  >FL_RESIZE_NONE</b>,
<b  >FL_RESIZE_X</b>, <b  >FL_RESIZE_Y</b> or
<b  >FL_RESIZE_BOTH</b>. For the
<b  >FL_UP_BOX</b> that holds the pull-down menus, we use
the <b  >FL_RESIZE_X</b> option, since we want the menu
bar to always be the width of the screen but maintain a constant
height. Similarly, we use <b  >FL_RESIZE_NONE</b> for the
buttons so that they remain the same size no matter how the window
is changed.</p><p>Object gravity is a related concept and determines how
objects should be oriented to the window in which they are drawn.
Using the example of the menu bar again, we don't want the menu to
drift down at all, even if the user resizes the window to be very
large. The function <b  >fl_set_object_gravity()</b>
requires a parameter for the relevant object and two subsequent
values, which dictate orientation behaviour. The first of these
determines which direction the upper-left-hand corner of the object
should move as the underlying window is altered. The second sets
the behaviour of the lower-right corner. Since we always want the
<b  >Help</b> menu to appear on the right edge of the
menu bar (and stay at the top of the window), we use the following
form of the function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fl_set_object_gravity(obj, FL_NorthEast, FL_NorthEast)
</pre><p>Conversely, we want the <b  >File</b> menu to stay
to the left, so we replace both occurrences of
<b  >FL_NorthEast</b> with
<b  >FL_NorthWest</b> in that call. With a little thought
on the programmer's part, XForms makes it quite easy to have
windows that resize in attractive ways. This can add a significant
amount of polish to any graphical application and make it usable in
a wide variety of circumstances.
</p><p>To dress up our program a little, we have inserted a pixmap
in the <b  >About</b> window. The actual pixmap data is
stored in a variable called <b  >xgtsim_logo</b> which is
included at the end of the source code. We then need two calls to
create the object that holds the pixmap and assign our data to
it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
obj = fl_add_pixmap(FL_NORMAL_PIXMAP, 13, 13,
        70, 55,"")
fl_set_pixmap_data(obj, xgtsim_logo)
</pre><p>We declare how much space we need for the pixmap image in the
<b  >fl_add_pixmap()</b> call, but it is the second
function which actually assigns the data. Since this pixmap is just
for decoration, we don't need to declare any callbacks. To use
pixmaps as buttons (in the same way that programs like Netscape
do), you'll want to have a look at the
<b  >fl_add_pixmapbutton()</b> function in the XForms
documentation.
</p><p>The fact that the logo is not particularly artistic should
not be taken as a shortcoming of XForms. I am reasonably competent
at hacking out C code but, even when equipped with <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
GIMP</em></span>, I'm no Picasso.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21db580.0x22cc0a0"></a>Using Goodies</h2></div></div><p>With the inclusion of a menu system, resizing parameters and
some decorative pixmaps, XForms-based applications like xgtsim2 can
be easily polished into user-friendly, attractive software. XForms
also provides a slew of easy-to-add program elements called
&ldquo;goodies&rdquo;.</p><p>An example of a goodie occurs in the code for
<b  >help_menu_routines()</b>. If the user selects
<b  >Use</b> from the help menu, he gets a window that
displays information about how to use xgtsim2. Since the program is
just an example, we haven't actually written any help files for
it&mdash;we just want to display a window explaining that help is not
(yet) implemented. We could create this window manually, adding
some text objects, an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button and so on; however, this is a
lot of work just to say there is no help available. Instead, we use
a goodie called <b  >fl_show_alert()</b>. This function
accepts three lines of text as parameters, as well as an integer
value to determine the placement of the ensuing announcement (the
value 1 just tells XForms to place the window in the center of the
display). With one line of code, we have an easy way to display
text messages to the user without having to design a new window
ourselves.</p><p>An even more powerful example of a goodie is the
XForms-supplied file requester. Writing one of these from scratch
can take a good deal of time, since we would need to create a
window with some kind of browser, open and close buttons, implement
a filtering mechanism, etc. The
<b  >fl_show_fselector</b> does all of this for us and
allows the <b  >load_config()</b> and
<b  >save_config</b> functions in xgtsim2 to be very
compact. The full form of the function is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fl_show_fselector(const char *message,
        const char *directory,
        const char *pattern,
        const char *default)
</pre><p>The four string parameters allow us to set the selector's
message, a specific directory to start from, a filtering pattern,
and even a default file name. All of this occurs with a single
function call. A somewhat subtle feature of the file selector is
the existence of six such selectors, each of which remembers the
last directory if the <b  >*directory</b> string is
passed as length 0. In xgtsim2, we use two of them, one for loading
and one for saving. In each case, we declare which selector appears
by making a call to <b  >fl_use_selector()</b> before
calling <b  >fl_show_selector()</b>. That way, if users
are loading data from one directory and saving it in another, they
will not need to keep clicking back and forth between directories
each time they want to access files.
</p><p>There are also mechanisms for adding configurable buttons to
the selector, setting the window title, and so on. Anyone who has
designed a method for letting users load and save files will
appreciate the amount of thought and planning that has gone into
this widget.</p><p>There are many other goodies provided by XForms, including
routines to get input from the user
(<b  >fl_show_input</b>), other message display routines
(<b  >fl_show_question</b>) and even a quick and easy
method for getting color selections
(<b  >fl_show_colormap()</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21db580.0x22cc7d8"></a>On Your Own</h2></div></div><p>There is still much about XForms that we haven't touched on
in this series, but the documentation included with XForms is
excellent at explaining all of the resources available. With a
little effort on the programmer's part, the library provides for
fast program development and a professional look. There's even a
form designer included in the XForms package which enables you to
design an interface using a mouse. This makes creating complex
windows a breeze, and the software produces output which can easily
be incorporated into your source code.</p><p>Even if you never create a &ldquo;killer app&rdquo; with XForms, the
basic lessons of placing GUI elements, assigning callbacks and
showing windows are reasonably transportable to other programming
environments and libraries. These articles should give you the
basic knowledge required to create X programs. To paraphrase Donald
Knuth, go forth and create great software.</p><p><a href="2010s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
