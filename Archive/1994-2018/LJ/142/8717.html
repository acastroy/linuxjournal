Introducing Nicholas Petreley as the new Editor in Chief of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd25580.0xe1d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I often bump into writer's block, but it's easy to start my first and
probably only From the Editor column for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. All I have
to do is start by talking about how I often bump into writer's block,
which allows me to segue into just about any topic at all.
</p><p>
When I first started the Webzine <span   class="emphasis"><em>LinuxWorld</em></span>, I
remember <i  >Linux Journal</i>
publisher Phil Hughes gave me a dirty look at a convention in Atlanta,
Georgia. Apparently he thought we were out to crush <i  >Linux Journal</i>
with a well-funded magazine. Wrong on all accounts.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LinuxWorld</em></span> was not
well funded, and it could never crush <i  >Linux Journal</i>. When Phil showed
some discomfort about <span   class="emphasis"><em>LinuxWorld</em></span>, I told him how
much I preferred <i  >Linux Journal</i>. He gave me a puzzled look and moved on.
</p><p>
Here it is, many years later, and I finally got my wish to
join the marvelous <i  >Linux Journal</i> team. Executive Editor Jill
Franklin is a dream, and by far the best editor I've ever had
the pleasure to work with. Garrick Antikajian is <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s
extraordinary artist. Subscribe and download a PDF copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span> magazine
(<a href="http://www.tuxmagazine.com" target="_self">www.tuxmagazine.com</a>) if you want to see how Garrick can turn anything
into a work of art. VP of Sales and Marketing Carlie Fairchild is unspeakably kind and
helpful. And I can't wait to work more closely with one of my heros,
Doc Searls. I could go on, but I'd run out of space.
</p><p>
I can't sum up where I want to take <i  >Linux Journal</i> in 25 words or less. So
suffice it to say I want to keep all the good stuff, make some things
more fun, add more articles of practical value and tune others to have
more practical value. Stay tuned.
</p><p>
Oh, why is this probably the only From the Editor column you'll see
from me? I prefer to do something I enjoy a lot more. Rant. Look for
my monthly rant at the end of each magazine, including this one. Okay,
I'm perfectly aware that some of you don't like reading rants. For $20,
I'll let you folks skip that page. (I can't do that? Sorry.) But I also
know some of you not only need to rant, yourselves, you have some of the
same pet peeves I have. Some of you have pet peeves totally opposite
of mine. But I have a feeling I'll hit a nerve one way or another,
and that's a good thing.
</p><p>
Last but definitely not least, send us e-mail at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. I'll fess up right now: I'm
overwhelmed with the task of coming up to speed on <i  >Linux Journal</i>. That,
and I'm a full-time single dad of two young kids. The combo ain't easy,
so I won't always get to your e-mail in a timely manner. But I want your
input. Always. That's how to keep <i  >Linux Journal</i> the magazine you want
it to be. So give me some time to adjust, but drop us a line and let us
know what you're thinking. We love it.
