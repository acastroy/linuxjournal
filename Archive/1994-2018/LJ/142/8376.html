Combine Samba with OpenLDAP for a mail and SSH single sign-on system.

Welcome to the third installment of how to
implement a single sign-on and corporate directory system. In this
article, we tackle integrating Microsoft Windows clients. There's
a lot involved to make it all happen, so put on your work gloves and
let's get to it.
</p><p>
When you want to integrate Windows clients into a heterogeneous
environment, you have some choices to make. Although you can run an Active
Directory (AD) server and have your Linux and Apple clients bind to it
for authentication and identity management, the costs involved are not
minimal. It also wouldn't make for an interesting article on an open-source single sign-on and directory implementation.
</p><p>
When you're binding
Windows clients to an open-source solution, you have two more choices to
make. Do you bind them to the Kerberos realm for authentication or do you
bind them to LDAP for identity management? This is an either/or choice
because although Windows clients know how to speak both Kerberos and LDAP,
they know how to speak them at the same time only when talking to an AD
server. In other words, Windows clients can talk to a non-AD Kerberos
server only when the user's identities are kept locally. Likewise,
a Windows client can get identities from LDAP via Samba, but only when
the passwords are also served via Samba, and Samba can't, at the moment,
authenticate via Kerberos.
</p><p>
Having Windows authenticate against our Kerberos KDC is easier to
set up, but it could be harder to maintain because every user who uses
the Windows client needs to have a local account. This is fine if
all you have is one Windows client to maintain, but if you have any more
than that, you'll need to add every user to every client. I won't explore this
option; however, if you're interested you should pick up Jason Garman's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Kerberos: The Definitive Guide</em></span>.

Configuring Samba</h2></div></div><p>
Because we're dealing with a corporate directory, I'm assuming you probably
have more than one Windows machine on your network. In order to make using
them and incorporating them as painless as possible, we use Samba tied
to our LDAP directory as a back end. Even though we'll be configuring
Samba a little differently, you should first read Craig Swanson and Matt
Lung's &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere
Revisited&rdquo; (see the on-line Resources), as it will give you a good foundation
on which to build. I
created an organizational unit branch in the directory named samba for
Samba specific entries such as machines and ID maps. Listing 1 shows the
hierarchy of these special branches, and Listing 2 shows the LDIF for them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240a580.0x25026b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
I don't use the smbldap scripts from IDEALX for creating necessary
entries,
because I'm using LDAP for more than just Samba authentication. One main
reason for not using the smbldap tool is because it assumes that it
and Samba will be the only point for actions such as adding users and
groups. In my environment, all users don't have the ability to log in
to Windows machines. Some users may start off as Linux-only users,
but then need to be given access to Windows machines later. The smbldap
tools don't handle this case very well. However, the smbldap tools do
handle other things nicely, so like all things, investigate all the
tools available and choose the best one(s) suited to your needs.
</p><p>
We need several users in LDAP that will do various tasks. First we need
a user who has write access to certain pieces of the directory. If
you notice in /etc/samba/smb.conf, there is an option, ldap admin dn,
that defines the DN of this user. This user, named samba_server, should
be stored in the LDAP directory itself, and it will be the only user in
the directory with a password associated with it. Because this user isn't
of the posixAccount objectClass, the account is not recognized under
Linux. To create this user, first run <tt  >slappasswd</tt> to generate the hashed
password. Then, take the hash and create an ldif file that's similar to
Listing 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240a580.0x2502b30"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. LDIF for the Samba User</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

objectClass: top
objectClass: person
objectClass: uidObject
sn: samba_server
cn: samba_server
userPassword: {SSHA}xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
uid: samba_server
</pre></div><p>
Next, we need to tell Samba how to access the LDAP directory as
samba_server user by using the smbpasswd command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# /usr/bin/smbpasswd -w &lt;password&gt;
Setting stored password for
&amp;rarrhk;"uid=samba_server,ou=people,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com"
&amp;rarrhk;in secrets.tdb

</pre>
</p><p>
For added security, you should turn off your shell's history logging as
the password is given on the command line. The smbpasswd command takes
the password given and stores it in /var/lib/samba/private/secrets.tdb
keyed to the Samba domain and the admin dn, so if either of those values
change, you need to rerun smbpasswd.
</p><p>
Because Samba uses this user to query and modify values in the
directory, we need to allow the Samba admin write access to certain
attributes in the directory, so make sure to add the appropriate ACLs
to /etc/openldap/slapd.conf.
</p><p>
At this point, we can get the SID for our domain. To obtain the domain's
SID, you need to be root on the primary domain controller (PDC) for the
domain, and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# net getlocalsid
SID for domain CI-PDC is:
&#8618;S-1-5-21-2162541494-3670296480-3949091320
</pre>
</p><p>
If you won't be using the smbldap tools to create all of the Samba LDAP
entries, you need to use this SID when creating those. I've included
a sample LDIF containing all the entries you need to create in the
on-line Resources.
</p><p>
Samba also needs a user with uid 0 in the LDAP directory temporarily to
perform certain actions. The entry need not be a full posixAccount user,
but it should look like Listing 4.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240a580.0x2502fa8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
Notice that this user entry does have an NT password, but this password
need not be the same as the actual root password, and it's only temporary
to get rights assigned to normal users. I've included a simple Perl
script in the on-line Resources that you can use to generate the NT
password hashes that are needed. You need the Crypt::SmbHash and
Term::ReadKey Perl modules to use it.
</p><p>
The last user to modify is your own, so that it's recognized as a Samba
user and is a Domain Admin. Listing 5 shows the LDIF.

A Note about SIDs and RIDs
</b></p><p>
The SID for your domain is a unique key and is prepended to domain
entities. The RID is a unique identifier for identities in the domain
and is appended to the SID to make the sambaSID. The algorithm I follow
to make sure RIDs are unique is to take the uid for a user, multiply
it times 2 and add 1000. For groups, take the gid, multiply it times
2 and add 1001. This ensures that users all have even RIDs and groups
have odd RIDs. The only exception to this rule are the Domain Admins,
Domain Users and Domain Guests. The RIDs for these groups are the same
as their gid for consistency with how Windows assigns them.
</p></div><p>
You'll notice that this account also has an NT password in the LDAP
directory. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Samba has no stable support
for using Kerberos authentication unless Samba is authenticating
against an AD server. There are ways, however, to store Kerberos
principal data in an LDAP directory if you're using the Heimdal Kerberos
implementation. This potentially could make Samba authentication a little
bit cleaner, though it won't make your Samba domain an AD server. Because
we're not using Heimdal and this isn't officially supported, we must
store Samba passwords in the directory. I've provided some links in the
on-line Resources on the Kerberos/LDAP solution if you're interested.
</p><p>
We're now ready to start Samba, but make sure you also start the winbind
service as well. Under Gentoo, modify /etc/conf.d/samba.

Samba Privileges</h2></div></div><p>
With Samba v3.0.11, the notion of privileges was introduced. Prior
to this version, a network-accessible uid 0 user was required for all
user, group, machine and printer management. As of v3.0.11, a user
with the proper privileges can initiate these types of requests. A
uid 0 user is still necessary eventually for some of these, but it no
longer need be network-accessible. So, you might be wondering why we added
a uid 0 account to the directory. Well, there's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem when initially setting up Samba. In order to perform these
special operations, you need the proper privileges, but you can't grant
yourself those privileges without having those privileges. So, to grant
a normal user those privileges, you need the uid 0 user briefly, and then
you can remove it from the directory. To find out which privileges your
version supports, you can use the net command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# net rpc rights list -U root
Password:
     SeMachineAccountPrivilege  Add machines to domain
      SePrintOperatorPrivilege  Manage printers
           SeAddUsersPrivilege  Add users and groups to the domain
     SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege  Force shutdown from a remote system
       SeDiskOperatorPrivilege  Manage disk shares
</pre>
</p><p>
Newer versions have added more privileges so make sure you know all
that your version supports before proceeding. Now we need to assign
privileges to groups and/or users. The obvious first step is to grant
all privileges to the Domain Admins group:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# net rpc rights grant "CI\Domain Admins" \
 SeMachineAccountPrivilege SePrintOperatorPrivilege \
 SeAddUsersPrivilege SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege \
 SeDiskOperatorPrivilege -U root
Password:
Successfully granted rights.

</pre>
</p><p>
At this stage, we should be able to remove the root user from the
directory,
because any member of the Domain Admins group should be able to issue
administrative Samba commands.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240a580.0x2503898"></a>
Joining a Machine to the Domain</h2></div></div><p>
So we have a Samba user but really nowhere for this user to login
to. In the Windows world, machines must join the domain for user domain
accounts to be valid. When a machine joins the domain, it needs to
create a domain account for itself. This account looks exactly like
a regular user account except that it ends with a dollar sign. Because
I don't use the smbldap tools, I wrote a small Perl script that
reads the admin dn's password from the secrets.tdb and adds the machine
account to the LDAP directory. The script is available from the on-line
Resources and depends on the Crypt::SmbHash, Net::LDAP, File::Temp
and TDB_File Perl modules. Once you have this script in place, you can
add the machine to the domain by right-clicking on My Computer, choosing
Properties, choosing the Computer Name tab and then clicking on the
Change... button. Enter an appropriate computer name if one isn't
already provided, then choose the Domain: option in the Member
of field and enter your Samba domain name (Figure 1). Once you
click OK, it will ask you for a user name and password. Enter the user
name and password for the user that is a member of the Domain Admins
group&mdash;leggett, in my case. After a few moments, you should receive a
message that welcomes you to the domain. Once you reboot, you'll have
the chance to log in as a domain user.

Single Sign-On and Windows</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's fine that you now have Windows machines plugged in to your
infrastructure, this article is also about single sign-on. You might ask
ask yourself &ldquo;But authentication isn't being served by Kerberos, so how
will single sign-on work?&rdquo; MIT has a Kerberos for Windows package that
allows you to obtain and manage tickets similar to Apple's Kerberos.app
(Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8376f2.large.jpg"><img src="8376f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MIT Kerberos for Windows Leash
</p></div></div><p>
The two main needs for single sign-on are SSH access and mail
access. Certified Security Solutions has patched the PuTTY SSH client
for Windows to allow GSSAPI authentication. In order to use the MIT
Kerberos for Windows under Windows 2000 and XP systems, copy the file
plugin_mitgss.dll to plugingss.dll in the PuTTY install directory. Once
you fire up PuTTY, go to the Auth menu in the Connection/SSH category
and check Attempt GSSAPI/Kerberos 5 authentication (Figure 3). Make
sure you have valid Kerberos credentials, and away you go.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8376f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. PuTTY GSSAPI Configuration
</p></div></div><p>
The last major piece to get working is mail access. Microsoft does not
use GSSAPI as its authentication scheme. Instead it uses what is
called SPNEGO. Because of this, Outlook and Outlook Express will not work
with our single sign-on environment. But there's good news. Qualcomm's
Eudora e-mail package supports GSSAPI, and it has a free version to boot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x240a580.0x280ee98"></a>
Configuring Eudora v6.2</h2></div></div><p>
Start the account creation process, and choose Skip directly to advanced
account setup. Enter the required information for the SMTP and IMAP
settings. Make sure to choose If Available, STARTTLS for the Secure
Sockets settings, and under the Incoming Mail tab, make sure to select
Kerberos as the authentication style (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8376f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Eudora Account Creation
</p></div></div><p>
Once you've gotten your account configured, you may get an error the
first time you try to connect saying that either the connection has broken or
GSSAPI failed. These errors aren't very descriptive of the actual
problem, which is that Eudora doesn't trust your self-signed SSL certificates. To
fix this, edit the properties for your newly created personality (Figure 5). Click on the Incoming Mail tab, then the Last SSL Info
button, and then the Certificate Information Manager button (Figure 6). If you click the Add To Trusted button, your self-signed
certificate will be trusted by Eudora as valid. You need to do this
for your SMTP server as well the first time you try to send mail.

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
You now have integrated one more major architecture into your single
sign-on and corporate directory infrastructure. There are still some
pieces that could be added or enhanced, such as a way to keep passwords in
sync between Kerberos and Samba, LDAP searches in Eudora and more-robust
Samba user management scripts. However, you can see how Kerberos
and LDAP can make administration and use of your system much easier and
more unified. In my last article in this series, I'll explore some ways to think about
using your new infrastructure for administrative functions. Until then,
keep expanding and using your corporate directory!
