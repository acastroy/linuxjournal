C, meet Python. Python, this is C. With surprisingly little effort, the
Python interpreter can be integrated into your program to add features
quickly that could take months if written entirely in C.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245f2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The language of choice for large, high-performance applications
in Linux is almost always C, or somewhat less often C++. Both are
powerful languages that allow you to create high-performance natively
compiled programs. However, they are not languages that lend themselves
to runtime flexibility. Once a C/C++ application is compiled, its code is
pretty much static. At times, that can be a real hindrance. For example,
if you want to allow users of a program to create plugins easily that
extend the application's functionality, you have to deal with complex
dynamic linking issues that can cause no end of headaches. Additionally,
your users will have to know C/C++ in order to extend the application,
which severely limits the number of people capable of writing extensions.
</p><p>
A much better solution is to provide your users with a scripting language
they can use to extend your application. With a scripting language,
you will tend to have much more runtime flexibility, as well as shorter
development times and a lower learning curve that will extend the base
of users capable of creating extensions.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, creating a scripting language is very much a nontrivial
task that easily could become a major portion of your program.
Fortunately, you don't need to create a scripting language. With Python,
you can embed the interpreter directly into your application and expose
the full power and flexibility of Python without adding very much code
at all to your application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245f4a8"></a>
Including Python in an Application</h2></div></div><p>
Including the Python interpreter in your program is extremely simple.
Python provides a single header file for including all of the definitions
you need when embedding the interpreter into your application,
aptly named Python.h. This contains a lot of stuff, including several of
the standard headers. For compiling efficiency, it might be nice if you
could include only those parts of the interface that you actually intend
to use, but unfortunately Python doesn't really give you that option.
If you take a look at the Python.h file, you'll see that it defines
several important macros and includes a number of common headers that
are required by the individual components included later in the file.
</p><p>
To link your application to the Python interpreter at compile time,
you should run the python-config program to get a list of the linking
options that should be passed to the compiler. On my system, those are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-lpython2.3 -lm -L/usr/lib/python2.3/config
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245f660"></a>
A Very Simple Embedded App</h2></div></div><p>
So, how much code does it take to run the Python interpreter from a
C app? As it turns out, very little. In fact, if you look at Listing
1, you'll see that it can be done in as little as three lines of code,
which initialize the interpreter, send it a string of Python code to
execute and then shut the interpreter back down.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245f768"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Embedding Python in Three Lines
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
void exec_pycode(const char* code)
{
  Py_Initialize();
  PyRun_SimpleString(code);
  Py_Finalize();
}
</pre></div><p>
Or, you could embed an interactive Python terminal in your program by
calling Py_Main() instead, as in Listing 2. This brings up the
interpreter just as if you'd run Python directly from the command line.
Control is returned to your application after the user exits from
the interpreter shell.

}
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245fb30"></a>
The Python Environment</h2></div></div><p>
Embedding the interpreter in three lines of code is easy enough,
but let's face it, just executing arbitrary strings of Python code inside
a program is neither interesting nor all that useful. Fortunately,
it's also far from the extent of what Python allows. Before I get too
deep into what it can do though, let's take a look at initializing the
environment that Python executes within.
</p><p>
When you run the Python interpreter, the main environment context is
stored in the __main__ module's namespace dictionary. All functions,
classes and variables that are defined globally can be found in this
dictionary. When running Python interactively or on a script file, you
rarely need to care about this global namespace. However, when running
the embedded interpreter, you'll often need to access this dictionary to
get references to functions or classes in order to call or construct them.
You also may find that you occasionally want to copy the global dictionary
so that different bits of code can be run in distinct environments.
For instance, you might want to create a new environment for each plugin
that you load.
</p><p>
To get at the __main__ module's dictionary, you first need to
get a reference to the module. You can do this by calling the
PyImport_AddModule() function, which looks up the module name you
supply and returns a PyObject pointer to that object. Why a PyObject?
All Python data types derive from PyObject, which makes it a handy
lowest-common denominator. Therefore, almost all of the functions that you'll
deal with when interacting with the Python interpreter will take or return
pointers to PyObjects rather than another more specific Python data type.
</p><p>
Once you have the __main__ module referenced by a PyObject, you can
use the PyModule_GetDict() function to get a reference to the main
module's dictionary, which again is returned as a PyObject pointer.
You can then pass the dictionary reference when you execute other Python
commands. For example, Listing 3 shows how you could duplicate the
global environment and execute two different Python files in separate
environments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245fd40"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Making a Copy of the Environment
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
// Get a reference to the main module.
PyObject* main_module =
   PyImport_AddModule("__main__");

// Get the main module's dictionary
// and make a copy of it.
PyObject* main_dict =
   PyModule_GetDict(main_module);
PyObject* main_dict_copy =
   PyDict_Copy(main_dict);

// Execute two different files of
// Python code in separate environments
FILE* file_1 = fopen("file1.py", "r");
PyRun_File(file_1, "file1.py",
           Py_file_input,
           main_dict, main_dict);

FILE* file_2 = fopen("file2.py", "r");
PyRun_File(file_2, "file2.py",
           Py_file_input,
           main_dict_copy, main_dict_copy);

</pre></div><p>
I'll get into the details of how PyRun_File() works in a little bit,
but if you look carefully at Listing 3, you should notice something
interesting. When I call PyRun_File() to execute the files, the
dictionary gets passed in twice. The reason for this is that Python
code actually has two environmental contexts when it is executed.
The first is the global context, which I've already talked about.
The second context is the local context, which contains any locally
defined variables or functions. In this case, those are the same, because
the code being executed is top-level code. On the other hand, if you
were to execute a function dynamically using multiple C-level calls,
you might want to create a local context and use that instead of the
global dictionary. For the most part though, it's generally safe to
pass the global environment for both the global and local parameters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x245ff50"></a>
Manipulating Python Data Structures in C/C++</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, I'm sure you've noticed the Py_DECREF() calls that
popped up in the Listing 3 example. Those fun little guys are there
for memory management purposes. Inside the interpreter, Python handles
memory management automatically by keeping track of all references to
memory transparent to the programmer. As soon as it determines that all
references to a given chunk of memory have been released, it deallocates
the no-longer needed chunk. This can be a problem when you start working
on the C side though. Because C is not a memory-managed language, as soon
as a Python data structure ends up referenced from C, all ability to track
the references automatically is lost to Python. The C application can make as many
copies of the reference that it wants, and hold on to it indefinitely
without Python knowing anything about it.
</p><p>
The solution is to have C code that gets a reference to a Python object
handle all of the reference counting manually. Generally, when a Python
call hands an object out to a C program, it increments the reference count
by one. The C code can then do what it likes with the object without worrying
that it will be deleted out from under it. Then when the C program is
done with the object, it is responsible for releasing its reference by
making a call to Py_DECREF().
</p><p>
It's important, though, to remember when you copy a pointer within
your C program that may outlast the pointer from which you're copying, you
need to increment the reference count manually, by calling Py_INCREF().
For example, if you make a copy of a PyObject pointer to store inside
an array, you'll probably want to call Py_INCREF() to ensure that
the pointed-to object won't get garbage-collected after the original
PyObject reference is decremented.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x2460108"></a>
Executing Code from a File</h2></div></div><p>
Now let's take a look at a slightly more useful example to see how Python
can be embedded into a real program. If you take a look at Listing
4, you'll see a small program that allows the user to specify short
expressions on the command line. The program then calculates the
results of those expressions and displays them in the output. To add a
little spice to the mix, the program also lets users specify a file
of Python code that will be loaded before the expressions are executed.
This way, the user can define functions that will be available to the
command-line expressions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x2460210"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 4. A Simple Expression Calculator
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;python2.3/Python.h&gt;

void process_expression(char* filename,
                        int num,
                        char** exp)
{
    FILE*       exp_file;

    // Initialize a global variable for
    // display of expression results
    PyRun_SimpleString("x = 0");

    // Open and execute the file of
    // functions to be made available
    // to user expressions
    exp_file = fopen(filename, "r");
    PyRun_SimpleFile(exp_file, exp);

    // Iterate through the expressions
    // and execute them
    while(num--) {
        PyRun_SimpleString(*exp++);
        PyRun_SimpleString("print x");
    }
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    Py_Initialize();

    if(argc != 3) {
        printf("Usage: %s FILENAME EXPRESSION+\n");
        return 1;
    }
    process_expression(argv[1], argc - 1, argv + 2);
    return 0;
}

</pre></div><p>
Two basic Python API functions are used in this program,
PyRun_SimpleString() and PyRun_AnyFile(). You've seen PyRun_SimpleString()
before. All it does is execute the given Python expression
in the global environment. PyRun_SimpleFile() is similar to the
PyRun_File() function that I discussed earlier, but it runs things in the
global environment by default. Because everything is run in the
global environment, the results of each executed expression or group of
expressions will be available to those that are executed later.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x2460420"></a>
Getting a Callable Function Object</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's say that instead of having our expression calculator execute
a list of expressions, you'd rather have it load a function f() from
the Python file and execute it a variable number of times to calculate
an aggregate total, based on a number provided on the command line.
You could execute the function simply by running
<tt  >PyRun_SimpleString("f()")</tt>,
but that's really not very efficient, as it requires the interpreter
to parse and evaluate the string every time it's called. It would be
much better if we could reference the function directly to call it.
</p><p>
If you recall, Python stores all globally defined functions in the
global dictionary. Therefore, if you can get a reference to the global
dictionary, you can extract a reference to any of the defined functions.
Fortunately, the Python API provides functions for doing just that.
You can see it in use by taking a look at Listing 5.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x24605d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 5. Using Callable Function References
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;python2.3/Python.h&gt;

void process_expression(int num, char* func_name)
{
    FILE*        exp_file;
    PyObject*    main_module, * global_dict, * expression;

    // Initialize a global variable for
    // display of expression results
    PyRun_SimpleString("x = 0");

    // Open and execute the Python file
    exp_file = fopen(exp, "r");
    PyRun_SimpleFile(exp_file, exp);

    // Get a reference to the main module
    // and global dictionary
    main_module = PyImport_AddModule("__main__");
    global_dict = PyModule_GetDict(main_module);

    // Extract a reference to the function "func_name"
    // from the global dictionary
    expression =
        PyDict_GetItemString(global_dict, func_name);

    while(num--) {
        // Make a call to the function referenced
        // by "expression"
        PyObject_CallObject(expression, NULL);
    }
    PyRun_SimpleString("print x");
}

</pre></div><p>
To obtain the function reference, the program first gets a reference to the
main module by &ldquo;importing&rdquo; it using the PyImport_AddModule("__main__")
function. Once it has this reference to the main module, the program uses
the PyModule_GetDict() function to extract its dictionary. From there, it's simply a matter of calling PyDict_GetItemString(global_dict, "f")
to extract the function from the dictionary.
</p><p>
Now that the program has a reference to the function, it can call it using
the PyObject_CallObect() function. As you can see, this takes a pointer
to the function object to call. Because the function itself already exists
in the Python environment, it is already compiled. That means when
you perform the call, there is no parsing and little or no compilation
overhead, which means the function can be executed quite quickly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x2460898"></a>
Passing Data in Function Calls</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, I'm sure you're starting to think, &ldquo;Gee whiz, this is
great but it would be a whole lot better if I could actually pass some
data to these functions I'm calling.&rdquo; Well, you need wonder no longer.
As it turns out, you can do exactly that. One way is through the use of that
mysterious NULL value that you saw being passed to PyObject_CallObject in
Listing 5. I'll talk about how that works in a bit, but first there is
a much easier way to call functions with arguments that are in the form
of C/C++ data types, PyObject_CallFunction(). Instead of requiring you
to perform C-to-Python conversions, this handy function takes a format
string and a variable number of arguments, much like the printf() family
of functions.
</p><p>
Looking back at our calculator program, let's say you want to evaluate
an expression over a range of noncontiguous values. If the expression
to evaluate is defined in a function provided by the loaded Python
file, you can get a reference as normal and then iterate over the
range. For each value, simply call PyObject_CallFunction(expression,
"i", num). The &ldquo;i&rdquo; string tells Python that you will be passing an
integer as the only argument. If the function you were calling took two
integers and a string instead, you could make the function call as
PyObject_CallFunction(expression, "iis", num1, num2, string). If the
function has a return value, it will be passed to you in the return value
of PyObject_CallFunction(), as a PyObject pointer.
</p><p>
That's the easiest way to pass arguments to a Python function, but
it's not actually the most flexible. Think about it for a second.
What happens if you are dynamically choosing the function to call?
The odds are that you're going to want the flexibility to call a variety
of functions that accept different numbers and types of arguments.
However, with PyObject_CallFunction(), you have to choose the number and
type of the arguments at compile time, which hardly fits with the spirit
of flexibility inherent in embedding a scripting language.
</p><p>
The solution is to use PyObject_CallObject() instead. This function
allows you to pass a single tuple of Python objects instead of the
variable-length list of native C data items. The downside here is that
you will need to convert native C values to Python objects first, but
what you lose in execution speed is made up for in flexibility. Of course,
before you can pass values to your function as a Python tuple, you'll
need to know how to create the tuple, which brings me to the next section.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2367580.0x2460b00"></a>
Converting Between Python and C Data Types</h2></div></div><p>
Python data structures are returned from and passed to the Python
interpreter in the form of PyObjects. To get to a specific type,
you need to perform a cast to the correct type. For instance,
you can get to a PyIntObject pointer by casting a PyObject pointer.
If you don't know for sure what the variable's type is, though, blindly
performing a cast could have disastrous results. In such a case, you can
call one of the many Check() functions to see if an object is indeed of
an appropriate type, such as the PyFloat_Check() function that returns
true if the object could indeed be cast to a float. In other words,
it returns true if the object is a float or a subtype of a float.
If you'd rather know whether the object is exactly a float, not a subclass,
you can use PyFloat_CheckExact().
</p><p>
The opaque PyObject structure isn't actually useful to a C program
though. In order to access Python data in your program, you'll need to use
a variety of conversion functions that will return a native C type.
For example, if you want to convert a PyObject to a long int, you can
run PyInt_AsLong(). PyInt_AsLong is a safe function, and will perform
a checked casting to PyIntObject before extracting the long int value.
If you know for sure that the value you're converting is indeed an
int, it may be wasteful to perform the extra checking&mdash;especially
if it's inside of a tight loop.
</p><p>
Often, Python functions ask for or return Python sequence objects, such
as tuples or lists. These objects don't have directly corresponding
types in C, but Python provides functions that allow you to build them
from C data types. As an example, let's take a look at building a tuple
since you'll need to be able to do that to call a function
using PyObject_CallObject().
</p><p>
The first step to creating a new tuple is to construct an empty tuple
with PyTuple_New(), which takes the length of the tuple and returns a
PyObject pointer to a new tuple. You can then use PyTuple_SetItem to set
the values of the tuple items, passing each value as a PyObject pointer.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
You should now have enough to get started with embedding Python scripts
inside your own applications. For more information, take a look at the
Python documentation. &ldquo;Extending and Embedding the Python
Interpreter&rdquo;
goes into more detail on going the other direction and embedding C
functions inside Python. The &ldquo;Python/C API Reference Manual&rdquo; also
has detailed reference documentation on all of the functions available
for embedding Python in your program. The <i  >Linux Journal</i> archives also
contain an excellent article from Ivan Pulleyn that discusses issues
for multithreaded programs that embed Python.
