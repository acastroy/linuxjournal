You certainly have a lot of tools at your fingertips, Fran&ccedil;ois, but don't
you think you might be overdoing things just a little bit? Of course, I'm
proud that you have taken to this subject so quickly, but having only a
portion of your screen left on which to run applications, such as a Web browser or
word processor, kind of limits its usefulness, don't you think? The whole
point of applets is that they are small, but you have so many running,
there is little room left for anything else.
</p><p>
No matter, Fran&ccedil;ois, we'll discuss this later. In fact, embedded
applications such as these fit in very nicely with tonight's menu. But
now we need to get ready as our guests will arrive at any moment. Too
late, Fran&ccedil;ois. They are already here. Welcome, everyone, to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>,
home of exquisite wines and the finest in Linux fare. Please, sit and make
yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois, hurry down to the wine cellar and bring
back the 1999 Brunello di Montalcino from Tuscany. Check the southeast
wing of the cellar, right past the Chianti.
</p><p>
While my faithful waiter fetches the wine, let me tell you about about
today's selection. Earlier on, I was demonstrating the power of those
small applications you find embedded in the panel at the bottom of your
graphical desktop. These little programs are called applets, and many of
them are engineered to fit nicely into your taskbar while still providing
useful functionality. Many people tend to think of this as the taskbar,
but in reality, the taskbar is just one of many application embedded
in that panel. Other embedded applications include the task switcher,
the menu, the clock and that system tray itself.
</p><p>
Before we continue, I should mention that KDE users generally have one,
all-encompassing panel at the bottom of their screens, while GNOME users
often have two panels running: one at the top and one at the bottom of
their
screens. I cover both desktops today, starting with KDE. These helpful
and common applets (the taskbar, panel and so on) aren't the only ones that
came with your system. In fact, there are several just waiting for you
to try.
</p><p>
Adding an applet to your KDE panel is easy. Right-click on the taskbar,
and move your mouse over the Add to Panel menu, then to the Applet
submenu (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8668f1.large.jpg"><img src="8668f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Additional applets can be added from the KDE panel by
right-clicking on the panel.
</p></div></div><p>
A rather large collection of applets appears from which you can
make your selection. Click on the applet of choice, and it appears
in your KDE panel. I will now confess my love for these little applets
in general, but none more so than the dictionary applet (Figure 2). When
I configure a new system for myself (or anyone else for that matter), I
invariably add the dictionary applet. I can't imagine the panel without
this incredibly useful little tool. Simply type in a word, press Enter and
the program searches various on-line dictionaries for a
definition.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8668f2.large.jpg"><img src="8668f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. I consider the dictionary and weather applets to be absolutely
essential.
</p></div></div><p>
Although this may be my favorite applet, I find many others are
very useful to have. Like most people around here, I tend to obsess
about the weather, and so I run the KDE weather applet (cloudy
and 5&deg;C, if you're curious). Right-click the applet, select
Configure KWeather and select your location from the city list. The
color picker is particularly useful if you are doing a lot of graphics
work and you want to capture any color on the screen, even from Web
pages. Then there's the moon phase applet&mdash;nothing like knowing that
it's only six days till the next full moon. If you are feeling particularly
geeky, add a binary clock. You'll find a system monitor as well. Take
time to try each of them out. There are certainly plenty to choose from
(Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8668f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. This is just a fraction of the many applets included with KDE.
</p></div></div><p>
Eventually, you may find that your panel is getting a bit crowded with
little room for tasks or even smaller system tray applets. What are you
to do when you fill up your panel? One option is to remove applets you
aren't using. To do so, right-click on the panel, go to the Remove
from panel menu and select Applet from the submenu.
</p><p>
If, however, you believe that too much of a good thing is just about
right, you may not want to remove your applets. Happily, you don't have
to. Simply add a child panel. Incidentally, this is what Fran&ccedil;ois and
I were discussing when you arrived&mdash;he had one too many panels and
a very cluttered desktop. Because I know you will all show restraint,
I'll tell you how it's done. Right-click on the panel and move your
mouse to the Add to Panel menu and then to the Panel submenu where
you'll find several options, including another Panel. Click here and a
plain, gray panel appears on your screen directly above your current
panel. You now have several options, one of which is to start populating
this child panel with even more applets. There are other things
you can do though, and I would like to tell you about a few.
</p><p>
First and foremost, you may not like the position of the new panel. To
move it, simply click and drag the panel to another place on the
screen. Your options are along the sides, at the top of the screen
or below the current panel. Another possibility is to right-click and select
Configure panel. This approach also lets you decide on the size of
the panel.
</p><p>
GNOME users certainly aren't left out of the applet madness. As I
mentioned earlier, the concept of a panel with embedded applications
exists here as well. Although we could work with either (or both) of the
GNOME panels, I concentrate on the bottom one for now.
</p><p>
The default look and size of the panel varies somewhat depending on
the distribution or release. My GNOME 2.12 panel had a default size of
24 pixels. Depending on the nature of the program, applets embedded in
a panel of this size tend to be a little hard to look at. Should you
find yourself in the same situation, right-click in a blank area of
the panel and select Properties from the pop-up menu. Once you do this,
the Panel Properties dialog appears (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8668f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. To make some of these applets useful, you may want to increase the default panel size.
</p></div></div><p>
In my experience, and on my monitor, 48 pixels is pretty much
ideal. However, how large you choose to make the panel is entirely up to
you and may vary with the amount of wine you drink. Just a little joke,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but an excellent idea,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Fran&ccedil;ois, kindly refill
our guests' glasses.
</p><p>
Now that you've prepped your panel, it's time to find and add some
of those applets. Right-click on the panel and a small menu
appears. Click Add to panel and a list of all the available applets
appears (Figure 5). This list may be one single list with a short
description of the applet in question, or it may be organized into
categories. Scroll down and find something you like, then click the
Add button. For my first applet, I chose the one labeled Fish, an
animated swimming fish that pops up random bits of cleverness using the
<tt  >fortune</tt> command. And, yes, the fish's name is Wanda. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non,
mes amis</em></span>, I did not make this up.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8668f5.large.jpg"><img src="8668f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Adding an Applet to the GNOME Panel
</p></div></div><p>
In a few seconds, your applet will appear in the panel. When an applet
starts, it rarely starts in exactly the position I want. Luckily,
moving it is an easy process. Simply right-click on the applet and a
small menu appears (Figure 6). One of the options is Move. Click
here and a small hand icon appears that allows you to drag the applet
to wherever you want it to live. You even can move it to another
panel (more on that in a moment).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8668f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Each applet can be configured, moved or removed.
</p></div></div><p>
Have another look at that menu, and you'll see that there are some other
useful options here. For instance, each application may have its own set
of configurations. The fish applet I had you install comes with a small
handful of additional graphics&mdash;you may not like fish. Simply click on
the Preferences menu to make your changes. Finally, should you decide that
the program you chose is just taking up space, there's a Remove option.
</p><p>
When applet mania has taken hold, you will find yourself out of
space. Yes, it is time to add another panel. Right-click somewhere in
your panel's empty space. From the pop-up menu, select New Panel. A
blank, gray panel appears that you can drag to any location you
see fit. As with the original panel, selecting the Properties dialog
lets you change the size to fit the applets you have in mind.
</p><p>
On the GNOME applet side, I have some of the same favorites, although
they are not entirely the same in terms of functionality. The dictionary
applet is a must, as is the weather reporting program. The fortune fish
(above) is fun, as are the eyes that follow your mouse pointer around the
screen. The Take Screenshot applet is particularly useful when you are
doing documentation. Because I work on a variety of systems, I'm also rather
fond of the Terminal Server Client and the Connect to Server applets.
</p><p>
Once again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, the clock on the wall would seem to imply that
we have once again filled up our allotment of time. Surely, there must be
some way to add another few hours to our day as easily as adding another
panel. Until then, we have my faithful waiter, Fran&ccedil;ois, ready to refill
your glasses one final time before before we say, &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Au
revoir</em></span>&rdquo;.
Please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
