<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #142, February 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>ksymoops</b></span> tool is no longer needed for decoding OOPSes under the 2.6
kernel. The kernel does it all for you if you build your kernel with
<span   class="bold"><b>CONFIG_KALLSYMS</b></span> enabled. After this, the OOPS output may be transcribed
directly from the screen to a bug report and sent to the linux-kernel
mailing list. Although it's hard to find anything
&ldquo;convenient&rdquo; about a kernel
OOPS, this at least represents one big step saved for anyone reporting
crashes to the kernel developers. The 2.4 tree will continue to rely on
ksymoops for all OOPS decoding, and this is unlikely to change due to the
late hour of 2.4 development. <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo
Tosatti</b></span> has finally begun to
stave off additional features successfully, and we can expect him to grow
ever more strict over time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pantelis Antoniou</b></span> has written code to
allow <span   class="bold"><b>AMD's Au1x00</b></span> embedded processor
to support communication over the serial port, via the standard 8250 serial
driver. The code was not actually so complex&mdash;the main oddities being that
the Au1x00 has registers at different offsets than the 8250 serial driver
expects, and this requires a mapping function to do the conversion.
Modem status-change interrupts must be disabled for this hardware, because
not all members of the Au1x00 family support it. These oddities have been
#ifdefed out of the more standard parts of the 8250 driver, but the ultimate
form of the code probably will be determined by the main kernel folks.
Although
#ifdefs are generally frowned upon, they also are still quite common in the
kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jaya Kumar</b></span> has coded up support for the
<span   class="bold"><b>AMD Geode CS5535</b></span> audio device, and
he has listed himself as the official CS5535 audio ALSA driver maintainer. This
looks like an easy sell, with no one opposed, and only minor technical
objections to overcome. <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> examined the driver himself and found
no serious flaws. <span   class="bold"><b>SPDIF support</b></span> is planned, but Jaya as yet says he has no
way to test the feature once it's implemented. The CS5535 was designed as a
client device for the GX 533@1.1W processor, and other Northbridge
components, to produce embedded appliances. Linux may use it this way or
may find some twisted yet brilliant alternative.
</p><p>
The primary <span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> server has moved
to the <span   class="bold"><b>Oregon State University Open
Source Lab</b></span>, where it has better bandwidth, better backups and a staff to
tend it. <span   class="bold"><b>Javier Henderson</b></span> flew the
machine there himself, on a private plane,
for minimal downtime. See <a href="http://osuosl.org/photos/kernel/view" target="_self">osuosl.org/photos/kernel/view</a> for photos of
the touching event and to find out more about OSL. Several glitches had to
be worked out after the move, including problems mirroring to the other
kernel.org nodes, and one situation where different nodes ended up with
different versions of git repositories, causing developers to see errors
when they tried to sync with <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>' tree. But these were
ironed out quickly, and the new kernel.org setup seems to be working out very well.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux boot code</b></span>, like the boot code of most if not all operating
systems, is complex and messy. And judging by a recent failed attempt to
clean it up, this may be the state of affairs for a long time to come.
<span   class="bold"><b>Etienne Lorrain</b></span>, who's been hacking the boot code since 1998,
finally decided to rewrite it from twisted Assembly to sparkling clean C.
Unfortunately, the only way he could see to do this was to abandon support
for the LILO and GRUB bootloaders. True, Etienne added a number of nice
features, such as eliminating any restriction on kernel size and providing
boot-time access to the BIOS in a fully functioning state. But as
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> pointed out to him, &ldquo;We have bad assembly bootup code. Adding good C
bootup code, that is incompatible with LILO/GRUB, does nothing to clean the
mess up.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephen Hemminger</b></span> has set up a new
<span   class="bold"><b>wiki for Linux networking documentation</b></span>,
at <a href="http://linux-net.osdl.org" target="_self">linux-net.osdl.org</a>. Originally started as a repository for his own
work, Stephen opened the wiki up to all networking-related contributions.
This has drawn some criticism from folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span>, who point
out that the wiki at <a href="http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org" target="_self">wiki.kernelnewbies.org</a> has existed for quite
a while and would have welcomed contributions by Stephen. Stephen's reply to
this is that there were Linux wikis before, and there would be more later.
In fact, both wikis seem quite good, and there is always the possibility
that they will merge later on.

<h2 class="title">Google Does Linux Videos</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #142, February 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Google famously maintains the largest farm of Linux servers on Earth.
(Ten thousand? Thirty thousand? A million? I've heard all those
numbers.) Perhaps less famously, it also contributes substantially to
many Open Source communities and advocacy organizations (for example, Free
Software Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, Python Software foundations and
OSDL). In 2005, Google's Summer of Code matched students and mentors
around the world to drive participation in dozens of open-source
projects. The company has also donated $350,000 to Oregon State University
and Portland State University for a joint open-source technology initiative.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the company also has taken some heat from members of
the Linux community (yours truly included) for releasing new software on
Windows alone, or only on Windows and Macintosh, before getting around
to Linux clients.
</p><p>
Well, that changed with the new Google Video service. When it was
launched as a beta service last fall, Google Video came with uploaders
for all three platforms.
</p><p>
Google Video's upload page also says, &ldquo;we prefer that you encode your
video files using MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 codecs with MP3 audio.&rdquo; Though they
don't give the reasons, they highly discourage the familiar proprietary
formats: QuickTime, RealVideo and Windows Media.
</p><p>
Unlike Google's familiar search service, Google Video is essentially a
giant server farm for anybody's video uploads. Google also provides a
mechanism for selling your videos, if you're interested. Charge any price you
like, including zero. The copyright is also all yours.
</p><p>
At this writing (not long after the service went live), there are 34
Linux-related videos on the service. Let's see how high we can make that
number.

Are you thinking that it might be time to move your music writing and
production projects to Linux? Or, have you heard some talk about
the much-improved ALSA Project, but aren't exactly sure what tools
are available and what they can do? Whether you are starting fresh on
creating your musical oeuvre or want to move your work to open source,
Dave Phillips' long-running <i  >LJ</i>.com series, At the Sounding Edge, offers
all sorts of overviews, tips and how-tos on ALSA, Ardour, Planet CCRMA,
Hydrogen, MIDIs, soundfile editors and more.
</p><p>
Dave's current topic is music notation software for Linux&mdash;programs that
do both music scoring and music typesetting. So far, he's
covered the Lisp-based Common Music Notation
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8670" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8670</a>) and the abc music
notation specification language (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8629" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8629</a>). In addition, Dave also wrote a two-part
article on LilyPond for us. LilyPond is the current favorite among many
Linux musicians when it comes to music notation, because, as Dave
writes, &ldquo;LilyPond automatically formats most music for excellent printed
output, at the same time permitting highly detailed customizations to
accommodate virtually any music scoring requirement, including unusual
and idiosyncratic notations.&rdquo; For details on how to get LilyPond, what
it can do and what its GUIs offer, check out Dave's articles at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7657" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7657</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7719" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7719</a>.

other Linux audio coverage, take a look under the Audio/Video Category
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/taxonomy/term/14/9" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/taxonomy/term/14/9</a>) on

Whether or not you wish to argue about Freedom to code versus the cost
of the software, what a lot of us are worried about is something even
more intrinsic to the problem. We're worried about keeping the time that
was spent at the front of the creation equation. We should be able to
donate that time and not have it used against us later. We should be
able to be a part of a community, and that simply means giving some
things away. The GPL guarantees that our gifts will have the longevity
they deserve.

Some expect the Microsoft Windows market share, today well in excess of
90% worldwide, to erode in the coming years. Market share for Mac
OS X is expected to remain flat, and demand for every other
non-Microsoft desktop operating system is expected to dwindle. So Linux,
already the fastest growing desktop operating system, is poised to
continue making desktop inroads.
