Wolfram Research's Wolfram Data Drop</h2></div></div><p>
It's always enlightening to learn what inventor, scientist and MacArthur
Genius Grant recipient Dr Stephen Wolfram is sharing with the world. The
latest dispatch from his company, Wolfram Research, is the Wolfram Data Drop,
a solution for handling data from the emergent Internet of Things. Dr Wolfram
notes the power of the Wolfram Language for interpreting, visualizing,
analyzing, querying and otherwise doing interesting things with this data. The
question however, notes Dr Wolfram, is this: how should the data from all
those connected devices and everything else actually get to where good things
can be done with it? The Wolfram Data Drop is Wolfram Research's next-step
contribution toward making the world computable. The Wolfram Data Drop not
only gathers and stores information from connected devices and the Internet of
Things, but once data is in, it also becomes both universally interpretable and
universally accessible to the Wolfram Language and any system that uses it.
Dr Wolfram adds that the Wolfram Data Drop will be of great value to
organizations or individuals that create connected devices, enabling them to
store their data in the Wolfram Cloud, or a private version of it, where it
will be readily accessible to analyze, visualize, query or deploy.

Jolla Ltd.'s Sailfish Secure</h2></div></div><p>
Mobile developer Jolla shows how our tribe shines brightest when options are
few. Chafing at the vanilla-chocolate, iOS-Android dominance, the team at
Jolla has released the secure&mdash;and first &ldquo;truly open&rdquo;&mdash;mobile phone
platform called Sailfish Secure. Based on Sailfish OS and utilizing SSH
Communications Security's SSH communication encryption and key
management platform, Sailfish Secure is a secure, adaptable mobile phone
solution for government officials, corporations and consumers. With Sailfish
Secure, Jolla and partner SSH seek to satiate the increased demand for privacy
in mobile communications as well heed the call for a secure, transparent and
open mobile solution alternative that is not controlled by any country or
major industry player. Sailfish Secure also enables significant adaptation to
local needs and hardware configurations. Jolla and SSH welcome other
industry players to join the initiative.

Ryft Systems Inc.'s Ryft ONE</h2></div></div><p>
To illustrate the power of its new Ryft ONE analytics platform, Ryft Systems
claims that a single device, using less power than a hair dryer, can store and
analyze the equivalent of the contents of Wikipedia in 4.5 seconds. Ryft ONE,
says its producer, is the first commercially available 1U analytics platform
capable of an unprecedented 10+ GB/second performance without any data
indexing, preprocessing, tuning or partitioning. The company further shared
that the Ryft ONE, powered by a new massively parallel, hardware-accelerated
architecture, analyzes historical and streaming data together at speeds 200X
faster than conventional hardware, enabling data scientists and business
analysts to slash operational costs by 70%. The new architecture, called Ryft
Analytics Cortex, is a platform built for real-time analysis, optimizing
compute, storage and I/O in tandem. The Ryft ONE, adds Ryft, &ldquo;is open and
compact like a Linux server but executes like a high-performance
computer&rdquo;.

EarthLCD.com's Pi-Raq</h2></div></div><p>
EarthLCD's new Pi-Raq, an open-source Raspberry-Pi-based 1U rackmount
Internet appliance, was inspired by the potential of an earlier company
innovation, the &ldquo;world's first&rdquo; 10" x 1" (25.4cm x
2.5cm) TFT LCD. That display is integrated directly into the Pi-Raq. This
was possible thanks to EarthLCD completing a comprehensive
open-source reference design for the new product, which includes packaging,
software and firmware to build a 1U rackmount appliance. EarthLCD notes the
importance of Raspberry Pi for allowing it to get the TFT LCD into
customers' hands quickly and allowing them to design high-value
Internet appliances rapidly, merely by adding their software- and application-specific
I/O via USB or I2C interfaces. Running Debian Linux opens up the Pi-Raq
standard network analyzer software, allowing music servers and numerous open-source
applications to be ported to the Pi-Raq.

Red Hat's Certified Container Ecosystem Program</h2></div></div><p>
Red Hat's newly announced Certified Container Ecosystem Program is really
a three-&ldquo;product&rdquo; solution set for delivering secure, reliable and
verified Docker-based containers to the enterprise world. The first element of
the program for ISV partners consists of access to the Red Hat Container
Development Kit, a collection of tools and resources to create
enterprise-ready containers. The second element is the toolset for delivering
the Red Hat Container Certification, which verifies that a container's
contents are secure, unmodified, free of vulnerabilities and supported on Red
Hat infrastructure. And finally, the third element is the distribution
mechanism, the fully supported Red Hat Container Registry. This inaugural
registry eventually will be part of a network of federated, standardized
container registries hosted by partners and ISVs. The new product is based on
Red Hat's outlook of Linux containers as the next wave of enterprise
application architecture. Containers facilitate the creation of an efficient,
composable fabric of lightweight &ldquo;microservices&rdquo; that can be woven
into more complex applications, yet still are flexible enough to adapt to
changing IT needs.

SUSE OpenStack Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
Formerly known as SUSE Cloud, the new SUSE OpenStack Cloud 5 is
available&mdash;the
latest edition of the company's OpenStack distribution for building
Infrastructure-as-a-Service private clouds. SUSE OpenStack Cloud 5 is based on
the newest OpenStack Juno release and provides increased networking
flexibility and improved operational efficiency to simplify private cloud
infrastructure management. Version 5 also provides &ldquo;as-a-service&rdquo;
capabilities to enable development and big-data analytic teams to 
deliver business solutions that integrate with SUSE Enterprise Storage and
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 data-center solutions rapidly. Additional version 5
benefits include greater networking functionality and support
for third-party OpenStack networking plugins, seamless incorporation of
existing servers running outside the private cloud and centralized log
collection and search.

NVIDIA SHIELD</h2></div></div><p>
NVIDIA is establishing itself further outside the confines of the PC with the
newest member of the SHIELD family of gaming devices. NVIDIA SHIELD is
NVIDIA's first living-room entertainment device, and the company calls it
&ldquo;the
world's first Android TV console to deliver music, apps, console-quality
games and video&rdquo;. SHIELD is built on Android TV and powered by
NVIDIA's powerful Tegra X1 processor. The artistically designed SHIELD
console streams high-quality 4K video content and enables native and streaming
gameplay at 1080p resolution/60fps. The console provides complete access to
Android TV's rich app and games ecosystem, with more than 50 games optimized
for the platform. Other games, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Crysis 3</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom 3: BFG Edition</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!</em></span>, are under development.
SHIELD also is the gateway
to the NVIDIA GRID game-streaming service, which the company sells as &ldquo;the
Netflix for Games&rdquo;. SHIELD comes pre-packaged with NVIDIA's
console-grade controller, and optional accessories include a remote control,
additional controllers and a vertical stand.

Jeffrey Haemer's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Git Under the Hood</em></span>, LiveLessons Video (Addison-Wesley
Professional)</h2></div></div><p>
Since Linus Torvalds invented Git in 2005, it rapidly has become the
standard distributed version control system in existence. If you need or want
to stop stumbling around in Git and truly understand what you're doing, a
professionally developed training resource is available. Jeffrey Haemer's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Git Under the Hood</em></span> contains more than six hours of video instruction
covering four in-depth lessons to help developers gain a deeper understanding
of Git so that they can use it more effectively. Intermediate to advanced
developers comfortable using a terminal window/command line will learn the
varied pieces of Git's repository, basic Git commands and how to use them,
design parallels between Git and Linux, how to experiment when Git
does something unexpected and how to extend Git with new commands.
