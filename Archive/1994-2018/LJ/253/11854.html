Loadwatch&mdash;intrepid shell script columnist Dave Taylor admits
that it's not the tool for all jobs and shows how to create a
smart load alert script that's perfect for sending SMS
notifications to your new smart watch.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're paying really close attention, you'll remember that
in my last article, I was exploring the rudiments of a script that would
accept a list of words as input and create a word search grid,
suitable for printing. It turns out that's crazy hard to do
as a shell script&mdash;it just doesn't have the muscle to
implement any sort of functional algorithm in an elegant fashion.
So, I'm going to bail on it, at least until I can find
someone else's open-source code I can explore for inspiration. 
</p><p>
Or, of course, if you're motivated and have some time to
experiment, go back to my April 2015 column, read through it, then
try your own hand at implementing something.
</p><p>
Before I get letters about the oddity of being the shell script
programming columnist who is bailing on a script, I will point out
that there's a lot to learn from this experience actually. Most
specifically, although it's nice to imagine that the Linux
environment is completely egalitarian, and that every script, every
language and every program is as powerful and well designed as every
other, it's clear that's not the case.
</p><p>
Take Perl versus Awk, for example. Awk is powerful and I use it
frequently, but although there are major software programs written in
Perl, you'd be hard-pressed to find any significant software,
functions, applications or utilities programmed directly in Awk.
The same goes for C++ versus PHP, for example, or any modern structured
language versus, well, the Bourne Again Shell. There, I said it.
Shell script programming can take you only so far, and then you
realize that you've hit the edges of the environment and its
capabilities, and it's time to jump to another language.
</p><p>
Indeed, when I wrote my popular book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell
Scripts</em></span>, there
was a tiny C program that snuck in by necessity: it was a few lines
of C to do a certain date calculation that would have been dozens, if
not hundreds, of lines of shell script.
</p><p>
Having said that, I will rush back to defend the shell as a powerful,
lightweight programming and prototyping environment perfect for a
variety of tasks because of its super-easy access to the power and
capabilities of the entire Linux environment and, by extension, the
entire Internet.
</p><p>
What's your take? You read this column, so it's 
reasonable for me to conclude that you are interested in learning
more about programming within the Linux shell environment. How often
do you bump into the bleeding edge of your shell and realize you have
to flip into Perl, Ruby, C, Cobol (just kidding!) or another more
sophisticated development environment to solve the problem properly?

Let's Talk about Text Messages</h2></div></div><p>
I was watching the Apple introduction of its new Apple Watch and was
struck by the fact that like a few of the high-end Android smart
watches, it will show you the entirety of e-mail and text messages on
the tiny watch screen. This means it's a great device for sysadmins and Linux IT folk to keep tabs on the status of their machine
or set of machines.
</p><p>
Sure, you could do this by having the system send an e-mail, but
let's go a bit further and tap into one of the e-mail-to-SMS
gateways instead. Table 1 shows a list of gateway addresses for the
most common cellular carriers in the United States.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5d930"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. E-mail Addresses of SMS Gateways for Cellular
Carriers</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. E-mail Addresses of SMS Gateways for Cellular&#10;Carriers11854t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Wireless Carrier</th><th>Domain Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>At&amp;T</td><td>@txt.att.net</td></tr><tr><td>Cricket</td><td>@mms.mycricket.com</td></tr><tr><td>Nextel</td><td>@messaging.nextel.com</td></tr><tr><td>Qwest</td><td>@qwestmp.com</td></tr><tr><td>Sprint</td><td>@messaging.sprintpcs.com</td></tr><tr><td>T-Mobile</td><td>@tmomail.net</td></tr><tr><td>US Cellular</td><td>@email.uscc.net</td></tr><tr><td>Verizon</td><td>@vtext.com</td></tr><tr><td>Virgin</td><td>@vmobl.com</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
For example, I can send a text message to someone on the AT&amp;T network
with the number (303) 555-1234 by formatting the e-mail like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
3035551234@txt.att.net
</pre>
</p><p>
Armed with this information, there are a lot of different statuses
that you can monitor and get a succinct text message 
if something's messed up.
</p><p>
Worried about load averages becoming excessive? That's a figure
easily accessible through the one-line output of
<tt  >uptime</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$  uptime
11:20  up 4 days, 22:44, 3 users, load averages: 1.08 1.40 1.46
</pre>
</p><p>
The last three figures are the load average over the last 1, 5 and 15
minutes. In this case, the system barely is being tapped at all. But
what if it jumped up to 10, or 35 or more than 100? Then everything would
slow down. Here's how you could write a simple script to test for
that condition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# loadwatch.sh - send an alert if uptime &gt; MAXOK
MAXOK=10
loadavg=$(uptime | cut -d\   -f11 | cut -d. -f1)
if [ $loadavg -gt $MAXOK ] ; then
  echo "Alert: Load avg $(uptime | cut -d\  -f11)"
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Armed with the information about the various SMS gateways, it's
easy to hard code a recipient address, which changes just the
<tt  >echo</tt> line within the conditional:
    
<pre     class="programlisting">
mail -s "Alert: Load avg $(uptime|cut -d\  -f11)" $recipient
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5e958"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where earlier in the script &ldquo;recipient&rdquo; is formatted similar
to:
    
<pre     class="programlisting">
recipient=3035551234@txt.att.net
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5eb10"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or as appropriate for your own smart watch or, um, other device.
</p><p>
For this script to be useful, you'd likely want to run it every
few minutes so that when there is a spike in usage, you're alerted
as soon as possible. This most easily would be a cron job, and if you
haven't explored how your own custom cron jobs can make your life
as even the most rudimentary of Linux users better, well, you're
missing out!
</p><p>
To make the script run every ten minutes, here's how it might look
in the root or even just your user crontab file:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *  /home/taylor/bin/loadwatch.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Modern crontabs have a more sophisticated notational language that can
make this a wee bit more succinct:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
*/10 * * * *  /home/taylor/bin/loadwatch.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
For this really to be useful, it might be better to have the script
monitor state changes, so it'd notify you when the load rose
above a specified threshold but not notify you again until it then
went back down below that threshold.
</p><p>
This is done with what we old-school programmers call a semaphore, a
state variable that remembers what's happening. Because a shell
script is transient in nature, the semaphore needs to be a file.
Typically these are located in a protected directory of some sort,
but let's just drop it in your home directory for the purposes of
this demo script.
</p><p>
The command-line function that's useful to know at this point is
lockfile(1). This manages the atomic creation of the semaphore so
that you never hit what's called a &ldquo;race condition&rdquo; where
two instantiations of the script might collide on who is creating the
file.
</p><p>
Here's how it'll work with the addition of the semaphore:

<pre     class="programlisting">

statefile=/home/taylor/bin/.loadavg
if [ -f "$statefile" ] ; then
  # statefile already exists, we're in a high load situation
  if [ $loadavg -gt $MAXOK ] ; then
    # still in high load situation
    echo "nothing to do, still in high load situation"
  else
    # high load situation has ended
    /bin/rm -f $statefile
    mail -s "Alert: load average back to normal" $recipient \ 
      &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
  fi
else
  # statefile doesn't exist, let's create it.
  if [ $loadavg -gt $MAXOK ] ; then
    # load average has jumped above OK level
    lockfile $statefile
    load=$(uptime | cut -d\  -f11)
    mail -s "Alert: load average is $load" $recipient \
      &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
  else
    # load average was okay and still is.
    echo "nothing to do, load average still ok."
  fi
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, there are two of the four possible scenarios where you'd really want to remove the debugging code, clean up the
if-then-else chain and shorten the script, because if this is going to
run every ten minutes, you most assuredly do not want &ldquo;no
change&rdquo; messages generated!
</p><p>
With that in mind, here's the more succinct code block:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if [ -f "$statefile" ] ; then
  # statefile already exists, we're in a high load situation
  if [ $loadavg -le $MAXOK ] ; then
    # high load situation has ended
    /bin/rm -f $statefile
    mail -s "Alert: load average back to normal?" $recipient \
      &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
  fi
else
  # statefile doesn't exist, let's create it.
  if [ $loadavg -gt $MAXOK ] ; then
    # load average has jumped above OK level
    lockfile $statefile
    load=$(uptime | cut -d\  -f11)
    mail -s "Alert: load average is $load?" $recipient \
      &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
  fi
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
Note the extra work involved in using the command-line Mail program,
where you have to redirect input so that it's not waiting for a
message from stdin and redirecting the resultant &ldquo;null message
body&rdquo; warning message. That's what this does:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, hopefully you can read through and see what it does.

What Else Could You Monitor?</h2></div></div><p>
Tracking load average is rather trivial when you think about all the
many things that can go wrong on a Linux system, including processes
that get wedged and use an inordinate amount of CPU time, disk space
that could be close to filling up, RAM that's tapped out and
causing excessive swapping, or even unauthorized users logging in.
</p><p>
All of those situations can be analyzed, and alerts can be sent to you via
e-mail or SMS text message, even to your shiny gold $17,000 Apple
Watch. Now, you tell me, what do you think is worth monitoring on
your system?
