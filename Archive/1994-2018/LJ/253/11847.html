All we need is to unbox business as usual.

Some of us work for money. Some of us work for love. Some of us work for
both, or just because we feel compelled or obliged.
</p><p>
As a journalist, I work for all those reasons, except money&mdash;meaning I
write as much as I ever did, but I rarely get paid for it. So I make up the
difference with other kinds of work for which writing and talking are still
marketable skills. The same goes for nearly every journalist I knew back in
the heyday of the trade, before everything got sucked into the Net.
</p><p>
Now, thanks to the Net, there is more news than ever, from more sources
than ever, coming through more channels than ever. Could be there's more
money than ever paying for it too. I don't know. I also don't know what
percentage of the total flow is news or journalism. Now it's all just
&ldquo;content&rdquo;.
</p><p>
No journalist of any quality (other than bad) thinks what he or she
produces is
&ldquo;content&rdquo;. Nor does any musician, or artist of any kind.
We hate the term
&ldquo;content&rdquo;. It sounds like packing material, or container
cargo. But hey,
that's the world we live in now.
</p><p>
It's a good thing the Net we have today is only about 20 years old
(1995 was when the NSFNET was decommissioned, opening the whole Net to
commercial activity),
and all businesses and business models are provisional anyway. They may do
for now, but none of them foreclose future possibilities&mdash;just as no
breed of commercial UNIX (launched by AT&amp;T in 1973) foreclosed the
possibility of free and open alternatives, such as Linux. (Historical note:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was launched alongside Linux 1.0 in 1994. And we know what's
happened to UNIX and Linux since then.)
</p><p>
So let's look at business models for free (as in beer) artistic goods as a
blank slate.
</p><p>
I know: we can't ignore copyright laws, rights-clearing norms and
industries (publishing, Hollywood) that call folks like us
&ldquo;pirates&rdquo; and
hold captive regulators by the short hairs. None of that will matter if we
make all of them happy by finding a way to get them&mdash;and the artists
they represent&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> money than they've been getting by coercive
means. If the answer is money, the only question is how.
</p><p>
Let's start with this thesis: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Information wants to be free, but value wants
to be paid for.</em></span>
</p><p>
If that's true, the trick is to make it as easy as possible for anybody to
pay for anything they like, wherever they find it, even if that thing is as
small as a like, a tweet, a post, a graffito or a tune heard just one
time&mdash;and even if all anybody wants to pay for that thing is a penny.
</p><p>
We do have proof that lots of people will pay for things they can get for
free. Apple, for example, proved that people were willing to pay 99 cents
for a song they could also get for $0 on Napster or Limewire. I've also
conducted tests of value by asking audiences at my talks in the US if any
of them listen to public radio. Usually most hands go up. Then I ask how
many of those listeners pay for the privilege. About 10% of the hands stay
up. Then I ask how many would pay if it was real easy. The number of hands
doubles.
</p><p>
Here's what I suggest for an approach:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
It needs be free-as-in-freedom as well as free-as-in-beer.
</p></li><li><p>
It should make it easy for anybody to pay any amount for anything they
like. Even if it's not a thing (a song, for example).
</p></li><li><p>
It should be programmable. So, for example, one could set things up so it's
as easy to throw a penny (or more) toward anything, anywhere, as it is to
like something on Facebook. 
</p></li><li><p>
It should be a capability that can be added to lots of different things,
rather than a standalone thing, such as an app. 
</p></li><li><p>
It should make use of APIs. That way, for example, one might be able to
throw a penny (or more) at every tune one tags with the Shazam app.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Those are just off the top of my head. Add more of your own. It's easy if
you think outside the boxes of business-as-usual and context-as-usual (such
as Facebook, Twitter, Apple and other silo'd sites and
services&mdash;or
thinking &ldquo;there needs to be an app for that&rdquo;). 
</p><p>
It also helps to think inside the boxes that have produced millions of free
and open-source code bases, and useful standards and protocols. Those are
the boxes where the base imperative is making stuff as useful as possible
for every purpose to which that stuff can possibly be put.
</p><p>
As it happens, I proposed one of these a few years back. It's called
EmanciPay, currently described this way on the ProjectVRM wiki:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
EmanciPay is a payment framework for customers operating with full agency
in the open marketplace. It operates on open protocols and standards, so it
can be used by any buyer, seller or intermediary.
Simply put, EmanciPay makes it easy for anybody to pay (or offer to pay)
&mdash;
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
as much as they like
</p></li><li><p>
however they like
</p></li><li><p>
for whatever they like
</p></li><li><p>
on their own terms
</p></li></ul></div><p>
&mdash; or at least to start with that full set of options, and to work out
differences with sellers easily and with minimal friction.
</p><p>
EmanciPay turns consumers (aka users) into customers by giving them a
pricing gun (something which in the past only sellers used) and their own
means to make offers, to pay outright, and to escrow the intention to pay
when price and other requirements are met. Payments themselves can also be
escrowed.
</p><p>
While EmanciPay was first conceived by ProjectVRM as a way to make live
payments to nonprofits and online publishers, it is also positioned as a
counterpart to sellers' subscription systems in what Zuora calls the
&ldquo;subscription economy&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.zuora.com/what-is-zuora" target="_self">https://www.zuora.com/what-is-zuora</a>), which it says &ldquo;is built on ever changing
relationships with your customers&rdquo;. Since relationships are two-way by
nature, EmanciPay is one way that customers can manage their end, while
sell-side systems such as Zuora's manage the other.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In &ldquo;EmanciPay: A Content Monetization Plan for
Newspapers&rdquo;, I say:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Think of EmanciPay as a way to unburden sellers of the need to keep trying
to control markets that are beyond their control anyway. Think of it as a
way that &ldquo;free market&rdquo; can mean more than &ldquo;your
choice of captor&rdquo;. Think of
it as a way that &ldquo;customer relationships&rdquo; can be worthy of the label
because both sides are carrying their ends of the relationship
burden&mdash;rather than the sellers' side carrying the whole thing (as CRM systems do
today).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I think EmanciPay can work as what Bruce Sterling calls a design fiction:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A formal definition exists: &ldquo;Design fiction is the deliberate use of
diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change.&rdquo;
</p><p>
There's heavy freight in that sentence, but most can be disposed of
promptly. &ldquo;Deliberate use&rdquo; means that design fiction is something that
people do with a purpose.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Diegetic&rdquo; is from film and theatre studies. A movie has a story, but it
also has all the commentary, scene-setting, props, sets and gizmos to
support that story. Design fiction doesn't tell stories&mdash;instead, it
designs prototypes that imply a changed world.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It's nearly impossible for any threatened businesses to imagine what will
disrupt them&mdash;especially when they are busy fighting disruptions
full-time already. This is why publishing, entertainment and other
content-pumping businesses can't grok the likes of EmanciPay&mdash;at least not
until they see a prototype such as might be produced in a design fiction
exercise.
</p><p>
But geeks who have already changed the world are in a much better position
to imagine out the possibilities, and actually assemble the code required
for it. That's why I'm talking about it here.
