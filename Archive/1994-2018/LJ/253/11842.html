Non-Linux Foss: MenuMeters?</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' Non-Linux FOSS Upfront piece in the March
2015 issue:
MenuMeters? Hmm...that's pretty much the same thing as GKrellM (which
has been around
since forever-ish). GKrellM not only displays all the stuff on your
working system but also on any of your networked servers with little,
if any, fooling around. I've used it for years to keep an eye on the
headless database servers sitting in the closet mumbling to
themselves. I've also 
installed it on friends' Windows machines for quick and dirty
troubleshooting and cores at 100% (ain't Windows wonderful, eh?). I don't
know for sure, but I'll bet there's a version for Mac?
</p><p>
Sometimes the oldies but goodies are a pretty good choice, methinks.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Thomas   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thomas,
yes, GKrellM is awesome, but there's not a readily downloadable version
for OS X. (There is for Windows, however.) Honestly, the &ldquo;Non-Linux
FOSS&rdquo; piece is one of the toughest for me to write, because most FOSS
software that is available for Windows and/or OS X is also available for
Linux. Finding non-Linux FOSS is...challenging!&mdash;Shawn Powers

Runtime &ldquo;Stuff Happens&rdquo;&mdash;Linux, Tell Me about It</h4><p>
I was pleased and interested to read about GNOME's pending enhancements
to its desktop notification component(s). With so many things going
on behind the scenes of a contemporary workstation, it is important to
have effective (aka, &ldquo;the right things&rdquo;) and efficient
(aka, &ldquo;things done
well&rdquo;) ways to tell the end user that something happened. One might also
hope that any such &ldquo;telling&rdquo; might also offer clues about what an end user might
do as a corrective action or workaround for whichever &ldquo;stuff
happened&rdquo;.
</p><p>
That's nice&mdash;where is the admin and end-user dispatch table that says,
in part, &ldquo;when EVENTx happens, do ACTIONx&rdquo;, etc.? Why isn't this dispatch
table as clean and obvious as /etc/anacrontab? 
</p><p>
&ldquo;Another tool
suite&rdquo;
called systemd is causing a lot of chatter trying to do mostly the
same thing&mdash;&ldquo;do ACTION when EVENT happens&rdquo;:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
FancyPrinter just dropped off-line. Show a dialog box to announce
that fact.
</p></li><li><p>
eSATA or USB drive connected. &ldquo;Do a little dance ...&rdquo; make the
content available.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Decades ago, I worked on TOPS-10/TOPS-20 mainframes. There was a utility
suite that 1) handled all of the notifications; 2) routed notifications
to end users, operators or others who were on the lists to care about
those notices; and 3) provided a per-user portal for trying to recover,
correct or resolve whatever was going on. I'm all for innovation,
but isn't it time we re-solved (sic) this feature set and move on?

Scale13x</h4><p>
I was listening to Kyle Rankin's &ldquo;Tails&rdquo; talk at Scale13x.
Sitting in the third row,
I heard a call for assistance on my two-way radio in another room;
I was an A/V volunteer. I wanted to get up and sneak into the back of
the room to exit so I didn't disturb the great presentation. Wow! When
I turned around, the room was jam-packed with people sitting all over
the aisle floors. I had to walk right in front of the room to exit.
I hope Kyle didn't think I was bored with his presentation. I did
have a shirt on that had &ldquo;A/V Volunteer&rdquo; written on it in big letters. I came
back after a few minutes and Kyle had finished, and there was a
crowd of people asking him questions. I hope he made it out of there
okay.
Most Linux folks are friendly though, and we did have a sense of community
at the conference.

Quizzes</h4><p>
I thought it would be interesting to share these quizzes with you and
your readers. At <a href="http://dcjtech.info/quizzes" target="_self">dcjtech.info/quizzes</a>, I made some interactive
quizzes about Linux that people can take for fun, practice, school
or interviews. My Web site is ad-free, so it should not annoy visitors.

Linux Newbie Request</h4><p>
I really appreciate Shawn Powers' enthusiasm and his approach to teaching
Linux in the CBT Nuggets
videos he's done for the LPIC 1 certification.
</p><p>
Currently, I'm in a software support role in LDN with descent bash
knowledge,
and my next step would be to move on to a system administrator career.
Can you recommend any Web sites with
LPI practice exams?
</p><p>
The Internet is packed with Web sites, but forum reviews are quite
concerning, as many are scams, outdated, crippled with errors or have
no support.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Patrick   <br><br>
</p><p>
I've found the folks at the LPI to be great to work with. I'd recommend
contacting them directly (even via Twitter) for advice on practice
exams.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Initializing and Managing Services in Linux</h4><p>
Thank you for the very informative and timely &ldquo;Managing
Services in Linux: Past, Present and Future&rdquo; article by Jonas
Gorauskas in the March 2015 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>. The
following is a URL of a
comparison chart of different init systems (yes, it's
Gentoo-centric):

Individual Contribution to Open-Source Project</h4><p>
Have you ever chronicled the experience of a software developer
contributing to an open-source project for the first time? Some of the
highlights could be finding a project, finding something to work on in
the project, submitting work, responding to rejected work and first
accepted work. Then as the developer becomes experienced, contrast getting
involved in more projects, so as to describe how valuable the lessons
learned were going forward.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jon Redinger  <br><br>

That might be an interesting story. If you're offering,
submit a pitch to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. See <a href="http://linuxjournal.com/author" target="_self">linuxjournal.com/author</a> for more information.&mdash;Shawn

systemd</h4><p>
I always hated the init solution&mdash;System V Init is definitely something
of an old technology. Therefore, I welcome systemd. It promises to
auto-restart; support &ldquo;new&rdquo; technologies like USB, Bluetooth, storage
devices and so on; and to support future technologies as well. It's a modern approach
to tackle the current and future problems in services. 
There always are initial start problems with new technologies, but we
shouldn't 
hold on to past technologies and lose the technology advantage we
have with GNU/Linux. 
</p><p>
&ldquo;Managing Services in Linux: Past, Present and Future&rdquo;
by Jonas Gorauskas in the March 2015 issue was a good article! I advise
Linus Torvalds to implement systemd as soon as possible in the mainstream
kernel as the default service manager and drop the older technologies in favor
of systemd. You could add a compatibility modus with the older one if
it is necessary, but the way forward is systemd. The fact that it's implemented
in Debian and Red Hat is already proof for me that it is good technology.
Maybe this is a good time to change to a higher version&mdash;for example, 3.4
or 4.0&mdash;to indicate a major improvement in the kernel?

Question for Dave Taylor</h4><p>
I was trying to put together a simple script to recurse through
a directory tree:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#/bin/bash

function recurse_dir()
{
    for f in * ; do
            #do stuff ;
            if [ -d "${f}" ] ; then
                    pushd "${f}" ;
                    recurse_dir ;
                    popd ;
            fi ;
    done ;
}

pushd ~/dir ;
recurse_dir ;
popd ;
</pre>
</p><p>
When running this script, I got errors about invalid options. It
turned out that some of the subdirectories had leading dashes (-)
that were being interpreted as options. I remembered that it is
possible to add a dash, or double dash, to turn off further option
processing. Have you any other tips for dealing with difficult
filenames? I think it is possible to have quotes in some, and that
has caused me problems in the past.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jeremy   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> That's an
interesting script you're
trying to build there, Jeremy. I'm not clear why you're using
push/pop as you traverse the directories too. Why not just have
<tt  >cd ${f}</tt> followed by <tt  >cd
..</tt> to get back up a level
and simplify things?
</p><p>
In terms of difficult filenames, yes, Linux wasn't really
written to deal with filenames that start with a dash, have a space
or other punctuation, etc. The best you can do is experiment to see if
the commands you're using accept -- as a way to delineate that
you're done with command arguments, and quote the directory names
themselves, as you've done.
</p><p>
Good luck with this!
