<h1 class="title">Beaker: the Decentralized Read-Write Browser</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The best future of the internet may be peer-to-peer. The Beaker Browser
offers a glimpse. By Michael McCallister</h2>

<p>
When Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, he envisioned a single
software package that allowed everyone to create and read pages across
the internet. Much has happened in the intervening years, but this idea
is starting to come back.
</p>

<p>
Many of the web's founders now realize that they didn't sign up for a
web dominated by a few giant corporations relying on collecting massive
amounts of data on its users to sell to advertisers.
</p>

<p>
The Beaker Browser project is creating a decentralized peer-to-peer web
browser that, if successful, could return the web to its users.
Let's explore how this is done!
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Guiding Principles</h3>

<p>
Beaker Browser serves as a bridge to a possible future for the webâ€”and
the internet. You can use Beaker today to surf the web like any other
Chromium-based browser. More important, you also can use Beaker to
create and support a new, decentralized, server-less internet.
</p>

<p>
Beaker Browser uses a peer-to-peer network protocol called Dat to
create a decentralized web platform. Websites spread from people seeding
them, BitTorrent-style. When following news and discussions about the
decentralized web, you'll often hear about blockchain as an underlying
basis. The Beaker team thinks that blockchain negotiations and "proof
of work" requirements unnecessarily slow down the web. It's better
to build "communities of trust" among peers than to try to eliminate
trust altogether.
</p>

<p>
Centralized servers, internet service providers and web hosting firms
restrict the options for users to collaborate with one another to build
a better world. Comcast, AT&amp;T and cable companies seek to end the
principle of net neutrality to narrow the content choices users have
always made on their own. At the same time, Facebook, Amazon, Google
and other giant content corporations seek to keep us locked inside their
respective walled gardens, persuading us that they have all the content
we'll ever need. There's no need to visit the open internet. Both sides
of this corporate clash do this to maximize profits for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Users deserve better, and Linux users want all the choices.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Explaining Dat</h3>

<p>
The <a href="datproject.org">Dat Project</a> describes itself as
"Modeled after the best parts of Git, BitTorrent, and the internet,
the Dat protocol is a peer-to-peer protocol for syncing files and data
across distributed networks."
</p>

<p>
Dat began as a file-sharing protocol, designed to allow users to
store and share encrypted files without using centralized services
like Dropbox. With the Dat Desktop app, you can make any folder on your
system use the Dat protocol. Every file in that folder is encrypted with
a private key. Dat also allows for storing version information for each
file shared on the network.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Installing Beaker</h3>

<p>
The easy way to install v0.8 of Beaker is to head to
<a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/download">https://beakerbrowser.com/download</a>
and pick up the AppImage. You can get
browsers for Mac and Windows here as well. To stay on the
bleeding edge, grab and compile the latest source from GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker">https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: Beaker is a 64-bit application. If you run a 32-bit Linux, you're
out of luck for the moment.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't used AppImage to install software yet, you may find
this process smile-inducing. Just make the image file executable. You
then can run it from the shell or GUI file manager. Beaker will ask to
integrate with your existing desktop environment, adding itself to your
app launcher for easy access.
</p>

<p>
Beaker is based on Chromium, so the user interface should be reasonably
familiar. The default start page (beaker://start/) has a search dialog
and a set of default Pinned Bookmarks. Following these links will give
you a pretty good introduction to the Beaker project and the peer-to-peer
web. Note that right-clicking on any element on a page offers an Inspect
Element option to open Developer Tools. Now you're ready to browse.
</p>

openSUSE Leap 15.</em>
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Browsing the Peer-to-Peer Web with Beaker
</h3>

<p>
Entering any standard web address in Beaker will display exactly as it
would in another browser, so that's not especially interesting. Where
you begin to see the bridge to the future is when you look at a Dat-based
page.
</p>

<p>
Start out by visiting the HTTPS-based <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/tour">Take a Tour</a> intro page.
On the right side of the address bar,
you'll see that this page has a P2P version available.
Click that button to see the Dat version of the page. The
page display should be identical to the HTTPS site. The differences are
subtle. The lock icon on the HTTPS site is replaced by a Share icon;
click the icon for a pointer to the Beaker wiki on GitHub for more
information. Because this page supports both Dat and HTTP, you'll see
the inverse Go to HTTP/S version button too.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Seeding Sites</h3>

<p>
A peer-to-peer network like BitTorrent and Dat depends on individuals
sharing files with each other. You don't need a server to contain all
the content, just some folks willing to help out. On the right end of
Beaker's address bar, you'll see another share icon, with the number
of peer sites that currently are sharing this site with you. Click that
icon, and you can join the peer-to-peer network, also called a swarm. By
default, you're sharing the page only while you're visiting. The box
tells you the size of the page. You can select a longer period of time
to seed the page with the slider: a day, week, month or forever.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Beaker Browser" src="12441f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. Keep this site online when you seed it on your computer.</p>
</div>

<p>
When you seed a site, Beaker stores a read-only copy of the page in your
/home directory (in openSUSE, it's inside .config/Beaker Browser). Seeded
sites also go into Beaker's Library, along with the sites you make. You
then can search your Library for relevant content.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Get More Information about a Site</h3>

<p>
Click the three vertical dots menu next to the shares site count to
access a ton of details about the site. Choose the View Source option.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you're likely to notice is the Dat link for the page in
the address bar. This is a 64-character public key identifier that never
changes. The link encrypts every file being transferred, controls access
to the archived files and includes version history. Whoever created the
Dat link created (and stores) the private key for that link/content. This
makes a Dat link more secure than even an IP address transported via
HTTPS. Side benefit: you don't need to persuade system administrators
to enable a new IP protocol to identify computers on a network. We have
seen how the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has gone to date.
</p>

<p>
The Files tab connects with everything connected to the page
content. Click Seed to spread the site to other
places. Click Make an Editable Copy to download
a copy of the site (or portions of it) to edit.
</p>

<p>
Click the Network tab to identify who else is seeding the site. You can
use this page to see what IP addresses are sharing, and use the Swarm
Debugger to see if those sharing sites are credible and trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
Click the About tab to get a description of the site and a downloadable
copy of the Favicon sitting in the corner of the browser.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Creating a Decentralized Site with Beaker</h3>

<p>
When Tim Berners-Lee invented the web, his browser also could write and
edit pages. Beaker's founder, Paul Frazee, originally wanted his browser
to work the same way. He quickly realized that most web developers today
have their own favorite editor. Beaker still provides an editor,
but you also can import web files from any editor to create a website.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Beaker Edit" src="12441f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Create and edit peer-to-peer websites. You can share files
too!</p>
</div>

<p>
To create a Dat-based website in Beaker:
</p>

<ul><li>
Create your content.</li>

<li>
Open Beaker.</li>

<li>
From the "hamburger" menu to the right of the address bar, select Create
Newâ†’Empty Project.</li>

<li>
Beaker loads a Library page with a dat.json file and .datignore file.
</li>

<li>
Click the Title field to replace Untitled with something a little more
memorable for your readers.</li>

<li>
Choose a Favicon by clicking the icon to the left of the Title. Choose
from the items in the menu, or Upload an icon from your system.</li>

<li>
Click the + and select Import Files or Import Folder
to add your content, scripts and styling files into the project folder.
</li>

<li>
Optional: set a local directory for your website. Go to Settings and click
Set Local Folder. By default, your sites are stored in a "Sites" folder in
your /home directory, with the project title (my-website). Click the pencil
icon to select another directory. Be careful when choosing an existing
directory, as that will become an encrypted folder. Beaker will open the
selected directory in your file manager.</li>

<li>
Optional: if you prefer, click New+ to create a new project folder or
file. Adding a file opens an editor inside the browser.</li>

<li>
Optional, but recommended: Beaker suggests you create a README file to
describe your siteâ€”who you are, why this site is here, what readers will
get out of it and whatever else comes to mind. Click the README button,
and Beaker adds a README.md file as you'd see in a GitHub project folder.
You can use the Markdown codes to format the file. Beaker reads Markdown
files into HTML automatically. You could create all your content in
Markdown if you like.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These files remain on your system only until you are ready to share the
site with the world (or some subset of it). You can continue writing
and editing files in the project folder as long as you choose. Change
the project title and Favicon on the Settings page.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Forking an Existing Site</h3>

<p>
Now you've made your website, and you want to make sure everyone sees it. And
by "everyone", I mean "people who can't see Dat links". The problem is that if
you enter dat://beakerbrowser.com into Firefox, the browser may deliver
a Google search page. Among the results is https://beakerbrowser.com,
and you start wondering how that got there. If you already have Beaker
installed, Firefox will suggest opening Dat links with Beaker.
</p>

<p>
Beaker supports the /.well-known web convention, and you can set this
up to create an HTTPS version of your site. An easy way to do this is
to copy some already shared files from beakerbrowser.com. Here's how:
</p>

<ul><li>
Open the Beaker Browser Dat site.</li>

<li>
Seed the site. Beaker will download the site's files into your
Library.</li>

<li>
Click the vertical dots and choose Make an Editable Copy.</li>

<li>
Make an Editable Copy of the files in the .well-known folder (or just
download them all) into your project folder.</li>

<li>
Review the files inside the .well-known folder. Where there are references
to beakerbrowser.com, change them to your site's name.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Beaker developer Tara Vancil describes what's going on underneath like this:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Beaker piggybacks off of DNS authentication in combination
with the /.well-known convention to enable dat:// shortnames. When
you visit dat://taravancil.com in Beaker, it sends a request to
https://taravancil.com/.well-known/dat and expects to find a file that
looks like this:
dat://6dff5cff6d3fba2bbf08b2b50a9c49e95206cf0e34b1a48619a0b9531d8eb256/TTL=3600
</p>

<p>
Because Beaker can trust the DNS resolution, Beaker
can trust that dat://taravancil.com should point to
dat://6dff5cff6d3fba2bbf08b2b50a9c49e95206cf0e34b1a48619a0b9531d8eb256.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Making Your Site Public</h3>

<p>
To make your new site available to readers, all you really have to
do is send your site's Dat link to someone else. 
</p>

<p>
Fun fact: You can share any files in your library, including the Beaker
AppImage!
</p>

<p>
Sharing your link on social media will begin to generate traffic as well.
</p>

<p>
You are now part of the P2P Web!
</p>

<p>
Be aware that your website is only online when the Dat files are
online. Unless someone else is seeding your site, it shuts down when your
computer does. So, encourage your peers to seed forever. One way around
this limitation is Hashbase.io, "Hosting for the peer-to-peer Web".
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Resources and How to Participate in the Beaker Browser</h3>

<p>
Beaker is still a project in infancy. Dat is a little further ahead,
but both projects could use some help. Here are some ways you can pitch in:
</p>

<ul><li>
Start by using the browser and reporting issues to GitHub.
</li>

<li>
Join the #beakerbrowser chat on Freenode.
</li>

<li>
Go to <a href="http://explore.beakerbrowser.com/">explore.beakerbrowser.com</a> to see some important P2P sites to surf,
learn and seed. It's included in the default Bookmarks on Beaker's
start page.
</li>

<li>
Create a new Dat site of your own and share it. If you already have a
site, consider mirroring it on Dat.
</li>

<li>
If you've got more advanced coding skills, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkcL4my2wgDRFvjQOJzrlg">Paul Frazee
leads a weekly live coding session on YouTube</a> every Sunday
on his channel. There are many other useful videos there.
</li>

<li>
The <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html">Beaker APIs</a> offer developers tools to make apps to enhance the
browser.
</li>
</ul>
