<h1 class="title">Everything You Need to Know about Containers, Part III: Orchestration with
Kubernetes</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">A look at using Kubernetes to create, deploy and manage thousands of
container images. By Petros Koutoupis</h2>

<p>
If you've read the first two articles in this series, you now should be familiar with Linux kernel control groups,
Linux Containers and Docker. But, here's a quick recap: once upon a time, data-center
administrators deployed entire operating systems, occupying entire hardware
servers to host a few applications each. This was a lot of overhead with a
lot to manage. Now scale that across multiple server hosts, and it increasingly
became more difficult to maintain. This was a problemâ€”a problem that
wasn't
easily solved. It would take time for technological evolution to reach
the moment where you are able to shrink the operating system and launch
these varied applications as microservices hosted across multiple containers
on the same physical machine.
</p>

<p>
In the final part of this series, I explore the method 
most people use to create, deploy and manage containers. The concept is typically
referred to as container orchestration. If I were to focus on Docker, on its
own, the technology is extremely simple to use, and running a few images
simultaneously is also just as easy. Now, scale that out to hundreds, if not
thousands, of images. How do you manage that? Eventually, you need to step
back and rely on one of the few orchestration frameworks specifically
designed to handle this problem. Enter Kubernetes.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Kubernetes</h3>

<p>
Kubernetes, or k8s (k + eight characters), originally was developed by
Google. It's an open-source platform aiming to automate container operations:
"deployment, scaling and operations of application containers across
clusters of hosts". Google was an early adopter and contributor to the
Linux Container technology (in fact, Linux Containers power
Google's very own cloud services). Kubernetes eliminates all of the
manual processes involved in the deployment and scaling of containerized
applications. It's capable of clustering together groups of servers hosting
Linux Containers while also allowing administrators to manage those
clusters easily and efficiently.
</p>

<p>
Kubernetes makes it possible to respond to consumer demands quickly by
deploying your applications within a timely manner, scaling those same
applications with ease and seamlessly rolling out new features, all while
limiting hardware resource consumption. It's extremely modular and can
be hooked into by other applications or frameworks easily. It also provides
additional self-healing services, including auto-placement,
auto-replication and auto-restart of containers.
</p>

<p>
There also exists Docker's own platform called Swarm. It
accomplishes much of the same tasks and boasts a lot of the same features.
The primary difference between the two is that Swarm is centralized
around the use of Docker, while Kubernetes tends to adopt a more generalized
container support model.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes production applications will span across multiple containers, and
those containers may be deployed across multiple physical server machines.
Both Kubernetes and Swarm give you the orchestration and management
capabilities required to deploy and scale those containers to accommodate the
always changing workload requirements.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Architecture</h3>

<p>
Kubernetes runs on top of an operating system (such as Ubuntu Server, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and so on) and takes a
master-slave approach to its functionality. The <em>master</em>
signifies the machine (physical or virtual) that controls the Kubernetes
nodes. This is where all tasks originate. It <em>is</em> the main
controlling unit of the cluster and will take the commands issued by an
administrator or DevOps team and, in turn, relay them to the underlying nodes.
The master node can be configured to run on a single machine or across
multiple machines in a high-availability cluster. This is to ensure
fault-tolerance of the cluster and reduce the likelihood of downtime. The
<em>nodes</em> are the machines that perform the tasks assigned by
the master. The node is sometimes referred to as a Worker or Minion.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Kubernetes Dashboard" src="12490f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 1. The
Kubernetes Web UI Dashboard (Source: <a href="https://kubernetes.io">kubernetes.io</a>)</em></p>
</div>

<p>
Kubernetes is broken down into a set of components, some of which manage
individual nodes, while the rest are part of the control plane.
</p>

<p>
<em>Control plane management:</em>
</p>

<ul><li>
etcd: is a lightweight and distributed cluster manager. It's persistent
and reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, providing a
consistent and accurate representation of the cluster at any given point of
time.
</li>

<li>
API server: serves the Kubernetes API using JSON over HTTP. It provides
both an internal and external interface to Kubernetes. The server processes
and validates RESTful requests and enables communication between and across
several tools and libraries.
</li>

<li>
Scheduler: selects on which node an unscheduled pod should run. This logic
is based on resource availability. The scheduler also tracks resource
utilization of each node, ensuring that the assigned workload never exceeds
what is available on the physical or virtual machine.
</li>

<li>
Control Manager: the process hosting the DaemonSet and Replication
controllers. The controllers communicate with the API server to create,
update or delete managed resources.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Node management:</em>
</p>

<ul><li>
kubelet: responsible for the running state of each node and making sure
that all containers on the node are healthy. It handles the starting and stopping of application containers (see how this differs with
Docker in the next section) within a pod as directed by the
manager in the control plane.
</li>

<li>
kube-proxy: a network proxy and load balancer. It's responsible for
routing traffic to the appropriate container.
</li>

<li>
cAdvisor: an agent that monitors and collects system resource
utilization and performance metrics (such as CPU, memory, file and network) of
each container on each node.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>
Controllers</strong></p>

<p>
A controller drives the state of the cluster by managing a set of pods. 
The <em>Replication Controller</em> handles pod
replication and scaling by running a specified number of copies of a given
pod across the entire cluster of nodes. It also can handle the creation of
replacement pods in the event of a failing node. The <em>DaemonSet
Controller</em> is in charge of running exactly one pod per node. The
<em>Job Controller</em> runs pods to completion (that is, as part of a
batch job).
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Services</strong></p>

<p>
In Kubernetes terms, a <em>service</em> consists of a set of pods
working together (a one-tier or multi-tier application). As Kubernetes
provides service discovery and request routing (by assigning the appropriate
static networking parameters), it ensures that all service requests get to
the right pod, regardless of where it moves across the cluster. Some of this
movement may be a result of pod or node failure. In the end, Kubernetes'
self-healing capabilities will get those ailing services back
to a pristine state automatically.
</p>

<p><strong>
Pods</strong></p>

<p>
When a Kubernetes master deploys a group of one or more containers to a
single node, it does so by creating a <em>pod</em>. Pods abstract
the networking and storage from the container, and all of the containers
within a pod will share the same IP address, hostname and more, allowing it
to be moved around in the cluster without complication.
</p>

<p>
The kubelet will monitor each and every pod. If it's not in a good state, it
will redeploy that pod to the same node. Apart from this, a heartbeat
messaging mechanism will relay the node status to the master every few
seconds. As soon as the master detects a node failure, the Replication
Controller will launch the now affected pods onto another healthy node.
</p>

<p>
So, how does Docker fit into all of this? Docker still functions as it was
meant to function. When a Kubernetes master schedules a pod to a node, the
kubelet running on that node will direct Docker in launching the desired
containers. The kubelet will continue by monitoring those containers while
also collecting information for the master. Docker still will be in full
control of the containers running on the node and also will be responsible
for starting and stopping them. The only difference here is that you now have
an automated system sending these requests to Docker instead of the system
administrator running the same tasks manually.

Spinning Up a Kubernetes Installation</h3>

<p>
Modern Linux distributions have made the installation and configuration of a
Kubernetes host quite simple. I use Ubuntu Server 16.04 for the
following example. <em>Note: you'll need a substantial amount of
memory and storage to run with this example properly.</em>
</p>

<p>
To begin, install <code>conjure-up</code>:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo snap install conjure-up --classic
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
<code>conjure-up</code> is a neat wrapper around Juju, MAAS and LXD. It's advertised as a
turnkey solution to enable big and complicated software stacksâ€”Kubernetes
included. <code>conjure-up</code> essentially processes a collection of scripts leveraging
the previously named technologies.
</p>

<p>
Next, install <code>lxd</code>:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo snap install lxd
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
LXD is Canonical's (Ubuntu's) homegrown container technology.
Whereas Docker is more focused on deploying applications, LXD specializes in
deploying Linux virtual machines.
</p>

<p>
In order to meet all requirements for installation to the localhost, you'll 
need to create at least one LXD storage pool:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo /snap/bin/lxc storage create kube-test dir source=/mnt
Storage pool kube-test created
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You can view the newly created pool with the following command:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo /snap/bin/lxc storage list
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+---------+
|   NAME    | DESCRIPTION | DRIVER | SOURCE | USED BY |
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+---------+
| kube-test |             | dir    | /mnt   | 0       |
+-----------+-------------+--------+--------+---------+
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You'll also need to create a networking bridge:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ /snap/bin/lxc network create lxdbr0 ipv4.address=auto 
 â†ªipv4.nat=true ipv6.address=none ipv6.nat=false

Network lxdbr0 created
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Run <code>conjure-up</code>:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ conjure-up
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You'll see a menu, where you can select the Canonical distribution of
Kubernetes.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Framework" src="12490f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 3. The <code>conjure-up</code> Framework Selection Menu</em></p>
</div>

<p>
Then you'll be prompted with the option to install various and useful
add-on packages to your Kubernetes deployment.
</p>

<p>
A few more options will be presented, such as where to deploy (for example,
the cloud or locally). For the purpose of this example, let's install and
deploy to the localhost, so in the following menu, select
the network bridge you created earlier (<code>lxdbr0</code>) and the storage pool
(<code>kube-test</code>). A couple simple questions later, and the installation process
begins. The entire process will take quite a while.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, installing the Kubernetes main components doesn't take
too long, but let's assume that by this point, everything is completed. As
part of the post-install process, the kubectl client application will be
installed, and then the host system will capture the Kubernetes cluster
status. You will be provided with an installation summary.
</p>

<p>
When everything has completed, run the following <code>kubectl</code> command:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ ~/kubectl cluster-info
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You'll see a short display of the cluster's running components,
including addresses to various dashboards and services.
</p>

Cloud Native Computing</h3>

<p>
Cloud native computing, often referred to as serverless computing, is not
only the latest trending buzzword in the data center, but it also offers a new
way of hosting applications. The idea challenges what traditionally has been
the norm and puts more power into the application itself while abstracting
away everything underneath it. But before getting into the details of
serverless computing, here's a crash course in
cloud computing.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Going Serverless</strong></p>

<p>
Cloud native computing is a relatively recent term describing the more-modern trend
of deploying and managing applications. The idea is pretty straightforward.
Each application or process is packaged into its own container, which in
turn is dynamically orchestrated (that is, scheduled and managed) across a
cluster of nodes. This approach moves applications away from physical
hardware and operating system dependency and into their own self-contained and
sandboxed environment, which can run anywhere
within the data center transparently and seamlessly. The cloud native approach is about separating the
various components of application delivery. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Evolution of Containers in the Cloud</strong></p>

<p>
As you would expect, container technology has helped accelerate cloud
adoption. Think about it. You have these persistent containerized application
images that within seconds are spun up or down as needed and balanced across
multiple nodes or data-center locations to achieve the best in quality of
service (QoS). Even the big-time public cloud providers make use of the same
container technologies and for the same reason: rapid application deployment.
For instance, Amazon, Microsoft and Google provide their container services
with Docker. And as it applies to the greater serverless ecosystem, the
applications hosted in those containers are stateless and event-triggered.
This means that a third-party component will manage access to this application,
as it is needed and invoked.
</p>

<p>
Now, when I think of a true serverless solution, one of the first things that
comes to mind is Amazon's AWS Lambda. Amazon takes serverless to the next
level with Lambda by spinning up a container to host the applications you
need, ensuring access and availability for your business or service. Under
this model, there is no need to provision or manage physical or virtual
servers. Assuming it is in a stable or production state, you just deploy your
code, and you're done. With Lambda, you don't manage the container (further
reducing your overhead). Your code is just deployed within an isolated
containerized environment. It's pretty straightforward. AWS Lambda enables
user-defined code functions to be triggered directly via a user-defined HTTPS
request. The way Lambda differs from traditional containerized deployment is
that Amazon has provided a framework for developers to upload their
event-driven application code (written in Node.js, Python, Java or C#) and
respond to events, such as website clicks, within milliseconds. All libraries
and dependencies to run the bulk of your code are provided for within the
container. Lambda scales automatically to support the exact needs of your
application.
</p>

<p>
As for the types of events (labeled an event source) on which to trigger your
application, or code handlers, Amazon has made it so you can trigger on
website visits or clicks, a REST HTTP request to its API gateway, a sensor
reading on your Internet of Things (IoT) device, or even an upload of a
photograph to an S3 bucket. This API gateway forms the bridge that connects
all parts of AWS Lambda. For example, a developer can write a handler to
trigger on HTTPS request events.
</p>

<p>
Let's say you need to enable a level of granularity to your code. Lambda
accommodates this by allowing developers to write modular handlers. For
instance, you can write one handler to trigger for each API method, and each
handler can be invoked, updated and altered independently of the others.
</p>

<p>
Lambda allows developers to combine all required dependencies (that is,
libraries, native binaries or even external web services) to your function
into a single package, giving a handler the freedom to reach out to any of
those dependencies as it needs them.
</p>

<p>
Now, how does this compare to an Amazon AWS Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2)
instance? Well, the short answer is that it's a lot more simplified, and by
simplified, I mean that there's zero to no overhead on configuring or
maintaining your operating environment. If you need more out of your
environment that requires access to a full-blown operating system or
container, you can spin up an EC2 virtual instance. EC2 provides users the
flexibility to customize their virtual machine with both the hardware and
software it will host. If you only need to host a function or special-purpose
application, that's where Lambda becomes the better choice. With Lambda,
there isn't much to customizeâ€”and sometimes, less is good.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</strong></p>

<p>
Formed in 2015, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) was assembled to
help standardize these recent paradigm shifts in hosting Cloud
servicesâ€”that
is, to unify and define the cloud native era. Although the primary goal of
the foundation is to be the best place to host cloud native software
projects. The foundation is home to many cloud-centric projects, including
the Kubernetes orchestration framework.
</p>

<p>
To help standardize this new trend of computing, the foundation has divided
the entire architecture into a set of subsystems, each with its own set of
standardized APIs for inter-component communication. Subsystems include
orchestration, resource scheduling and distributed systems services.
</p>

<p>
You can learn more about the foundation by visiting the foundation's
<a href="https://www.cncf.io.">official website</a>.

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Summary</h3>

<p>
Kubernetes expands beyond the management of the traditional container and
allows you to scale to meet consumer demands effectively and efficiently. And
with modern and major Linux distributions, deploying a Kubernetes cluster is as
simple as running a script and answering a few questions.
</p>

<p>
As you explore this wonderful technology further, know that you are not
alone. There are companies that provide services and solutions centered
around Kubernetes. One such company is Heptio, which was founded by Kubernetes
co-creators Craig McLuckie and Joe Beda. Centered around both developers and
system administrators, Heptio's products and services simplify and scale
the Kubernetes ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
There is also the need to maintain both security and compliance of your
container images within that same ecosystem. Again, when you scale to the
thousands, management of such things is near impossible. That's where
companies like Twistlock do the heavy-lifting for you. Twistlock develops
and distributes a product of the same name focusing on nothing but Docker
image security and compliance. It also can be operated from and managed by
orchestration platforms including Kubernetes.
