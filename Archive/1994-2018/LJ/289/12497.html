On Project Fi</h3>

<p>
I just finished reading Shawn Powers' <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/look-googles-project-fi">"A Look
at Google's Project Fi"</a> from the July 2018 issue, and I
wanted to chime in from the bus I am currently riding from Siem Reap to Phnom
Penh, Cambodia, using my Pixel on Project Fi. One of the greatest benefits
for me is the ability to use it in almost every country in the world. I have
personally used Project Fi in Japan, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Korea,
Cambodia, Singapore and of course the US. I keep a data-only SIM in a spare
(non-fi-compatible) phone and use that one via USB tether to a travel
router to provide access to several devices when no WiFi is available. 
</p>

<p>
When I can connect to a hotel's WiFi, Google Fi lets me make calls back to
the US at no charge. 
</p>

<p>
One more thing: if you set up a Google Voice number, you can use the Hangouts Dialer
to make and receive calls from a data-only SIM, and SMS comes through
Hangouts. For that to work, you need to use a different account from the one
that Fi is set up on.
</p>

<p>
Regards, and keep up the great work!
</p>

<p><strong>Shawn Powers replies:</strong> I haven't been able to test the
international usefulness myself (apart
from briefly picking up a Canadian tower when I was in Michigan's
upper peninsula). It's great to hear how well it works! Also, the
Hangouts tip is great. I could see that being an awesome solution for
a family trying to save money with younger kids. That way they still could
make
calls, but not need a new "line" to do it. Thanks!
</p>


<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">More on Project Fi</h3>

<p>
I liked Shawn Powers' article about Project Fi, but with the restriction to T-Mobile for
data only, you also should look into the Ting service as an alternative. It's $6
per phone for the "line" to keep the SIM active, and then everything else is
shared and pay-as-you-go. It works on virtually any GSM phone. You can buy
the SIM cards at Kroger and so on.
</p>

<p>
I have a cheap ($60 new) Blu Android 6.0 smartphone that I use with Ting. I
use it only for sending text messages from our home security system. The
basic $3 for 300 texts means my monthly bill is around $11.27 after taxes, or
only $8.27 if no alert texts get sent. This is very much worthwhile for the
peace of mind that comes from knowing I'll get alerts even if the internet is
down, along with alerts when the AC power goes down and is restored.
</p>

<p>
Since I was already using MQTT in my home security system, it was easy to
install Termux and Termux-API from the play store, node-red using apt-get and
then in a web browser create a flow (what node-red calls a program) to accept
SMS messages over MQTT and send them out on the Ting /T-Mobile network using
Termux-API.
</p>

<p>
If you can find something cheaper, it'd be fantastic, but I've been looking for a long
time. The free FredoomPop service actually meets most of my smartphone needs
(100MB/month free data on AT&amp;T, 400MB/month free on Sprint), but they use a
"special" VOIP dialer and messaging app that doesn't properly register its
"Android Intent", so the termux-node-red SMS messages end up in the default
Android Messages App and never get sent.
</p>


<p>
I'm very happy that <em>LJ</em> has made a comeback!
</p>

<p>
If you want an idea for an article, take a look at this project I've put up on
GitHub:
<a href="https://github.com/wb666greene/SecurityDVR_AI_addon">https://github.com/wb666greene/SecurityDVR_AI_addon</a>.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea is to use a Raspberry Pi3 and Movidius Neural Compute Stick to
add AI "person detection" to snapshot images from an existing video security
DVR and send "push" notifications via SMS and email with an image when a person
is detected when and where they shouldn't be. The Movidius can do about ten
images per second. My system has been running for over a month now
monitoring eight cameras, and the false alarm rate is effectively
zero—the only
bogus alerts were when my wife put some hand-washed clothes or a chair on the
pool deck, and another was when she put her floppy sun hat on top of the tower
fan on the patio—both kind of looked like a person at a quick glance.
</p>

<p>
I'm also about to put up a project doing a standalone AI-enhanced security
camera using a Raspberry Pi (2B or above) and Pi NoIR camera module. It 
achieves only about one frame every two seconds, but the highly reliable push alerts
make it well worth the ~$80 it takes for parts. I've uncovered what seems
to be a bug in the openCV dnn module. I'm testing a workaround on two
systems as I type this, and if they run for a week or more, I'll put the
project up, but I'd prefer to find a real solution to the issue first. I've
got questions out, but so far no responses.

<p><strong>Shawn Powers replies:</strong> Thanks for the tip on Ting. I'll
offer another possibility, one that I
used last year for our foreign-exchange student: RedPocket. It looks
like the price isn't as low as it was when I bought it, but I got an
annual contract, with SIM, which had 500MB of data, 500 minutes of
voice and 500 text messages per month for $60. It looks like the same
deal is $99 now, but maybe it goes on sale. Nevertheless, pre-paid
plans are amazing for certain circumstances, and it's nice to see
affordable options out there!
</p>

<p>
As far as the project goes, I'd love to see details about it. Heck, I
have a Raspberry Pi sitting on my desk looking for a project. I'll
look at your GitHub page and might have some questions for you. I'll
be sure to give you accolades if I set up the project!

Regarding Work the Shell, "Shuffling Letters and Words" in the July
Issue</h3>

<p>
Something that works on Mac OSX (or pretty much anything with
<code>$RANDOM</code> and
bourne-like shell):

</p>
<pre><code>
cat 1984.txt | sed -e '1i \
cat &lt;&lt;HERE' -e 's/^/\$RANDOM    /' -e '$a \
HERE' | sh | sort | cut -f2
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Note: there's a tab after <code>$RANDOM</code>.

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">BirdCam—Image Capture and Classification</h3>

<p>
To Shawn Powers: I am a fan of <em>Linux Journal</em> and have come across something I think might
pique your interest.
</p>

<p>
I found an article while searching for home automation and security ideas. A
guy named Robin Cole created a system to classify images as bird or "not
bird"
at his home, using a few of your favourite things: birds, bird feeder,
Raspberry Pi, Synlogy NAS and a webcam. 
</p>

<p>
You might even be challenged to identify the bird in the image too, who
knows.
</p>

<p>
Have a look
<a href="https://www.hackster.io/robin-cole/motion-activated-image-capture-and-classification-of-birds-6ef1ce">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
As far as I could see, most of it is open source too.
</p>

<p><strong>Shawn Powers replies:</strong> Whoa, that's awesome! One of the
problems I have with my
motion detection is false positives. If you watch my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX2mnjaa9m4PyGDzNhI2NvQ/videos">nightly
archives</a>,
you'll see a lot of the "motion" is non-feather-related. I'll have to
check it out, thanks for the link!

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Question for Kyle Rankin Regarding Odroid Xu4 NAS</h3>

<p>
Can you please detail the software stack, configuration, and back-up scripts
that power your Odroid Xu4/Mediasonic Probox NAS solution?
Many thanks,
</p>

<p>
—Lloyd
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kyle Rankin replies:</strong> Thanks for the letter. It's true that I
mostly focused on the hardware side
of my NAS in my <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/papas-got-brand-new-nas">"Papa's
Got a Brand New NAS"</a> article. I should do a
follow-up column at some point in the future about the software side. In
summary, I use an off-the-shelf Debian image and standard NFS and CIFS file-sharing services to share directories with other computers on my network.

@reuvenmlerner I enjoyed your article on Dataclasses in @linuxjournal and I'm
interested in your courses. Is there a difference in level/content between
"Practice Makes Python" and the Weekly Python Exercise?
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Reuven M. Lerner @reuvenmlerner:</strong>
Replying to @augmentedfourth @linuxjournal
Glad you enjoyed it! Practice Makes Python is a course with exercises. You
do it on your own, either with or without video instructions/explanations.
It's aimed at people who have a more basic background, roughly people who
have been through my intro course.</em>
