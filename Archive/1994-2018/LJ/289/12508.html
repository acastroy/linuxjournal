<h1 class="title">Astronomy on KDE</h1>

<p>
I recently switched to KDE and Plasma as my main desktop environment, so I
thought I'd start digging into some of the scientific software available on KDE.
First up is KStars, the desktop astronomy program. 
</p>

<p>
KStars probably
won't be installed with the standard KDE desktop, so you may need to install it. If
you're using a Debian-based distribution, you can install KStars with the following
command:
   
</p>
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install kstars
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
When you first start it, KStars asks for your current location, and then it
gives you the option of installing several extra information files to add to
the list of objects that KStars knows about and can display. Once those steps are
finished,
KStars begins with the current sky at the location you entered earlier.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="KStars Screen" src="12508f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 1. On startup, KStars shows you the current layout of the sky in your
location.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
So, what can you do with KStars? If you've used programs like Stellarium before, you'll
find that you can do the same types of tasks with KStars. You can use your
mouse to click and drag the display to change the direction you're facing. The
cardinal directions are labeled along the outside of the circle of the sky, and you can
zoom in and out to change the field of view. If you see an object you want to examine
further, you can
double-click it to center it on the display and tag it as the current object of
interest.
</p>

<p>
Depending on what catalogs of data you installed, some of the objects
may have more or less information available. For example, selecting the planet
Uranus and zooming all the way in shows a reasonably detailed image of the planet,
including the ring orientation. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="KStars Planet" src="12508f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 2. You can easily select and zoom in to objects of interest in KStars.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
Quite a few options are available for
controlling what's shown in the main window. The toolbar across the top of the window
allows you to toggle the following items: stars, deep sky objects, solar system objects,
supernovae, satellites, constellation lines, constellation names, constellation art,
constellation boundaries, Milky Way, equatorial coordinate grid, horizontal coordinate
grid and opaque ground. This allows you to customize the display so that it shows
only what you're interested in at the time. The last display option is to toggle the "What's
Interesting" pane. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="KStar Current Location Screen" src="12508f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 3. The "What's Interesting" pane lets you focus on a particular type of
object visible in the sky with the current location and time.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
You can click one an item in the pane, and then
an object of that type will be highlighted in the display. The pane also changes to show a
detailed list of all of those objects.
</p>

<p>
What if you want to change the current viewing conditions? Maybe you want to see
what will be visible when you're on vacation next week? It's easy to
change the time and location. Simply click the
globe in the toolbar to pop up the location dialog. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Location dialog" src="12508f4.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 4. The location dialog lets you set where in the world you are, so you can see
what's visible in the sky from that location.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
If you click the clock icon in the toolbar, the time dialog pops up where you can set
the viewing time and date, allowing you to 
see what's visible from anywhere and anytime. You 
also can change what information is available. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="KStar Time And Date" src="12508f5.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 5. You can set the time and date to see what would be
visible a given time and date with the time dialog.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
If you declined to download extra information files when
you first started KStars, you can go back in to that section and select some 
catalogs. Clicking Data→Download New Data opens a dialog
window where you can select extra catalogs to install. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="KStar data catalogs" src="12508f6.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 6. You can select from several extra data catalogs to add even more
objects to KStars.</em></p>
</div>
<p>
For objects that vary over time, you can download updated data by clicking 
Data→Updates, and selecting one of comets, asteroids, satellites or recent
supernovae.
</p>

<p>
If your telescope supports computer control, you can use KStars to
connect to it and give it instructions on what to do. Clicking 
Tools→Devices→Telescope Wizard opens a new window that walks you through the
steps for adding your telescope's details to KStars. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Telescope wizard" src="12508f7.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 7. You can go through the telescope wizard to add the details for your
particular device and allow KStars to communicate with it.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
You can manage these
telescopes, along with a huge number of other potential devices, by clicking 
Tools→Devices→Device Manager, which opens a window of devices
that KStars understands grouped by type. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Device Manager" src="12508f8.jpg"/>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 8. You can control a large number of potential devices with
KStars.</em></p>
</div>

<p>
Kstars also understands Ekos, the
cross-platform observatory control and automation tool from the Open Astronomy
Instrumentation group. The group also provides the Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface
(INDI) library, which KStars also understands. Clicking Tools→Ekos
opens a new window where you can go through the steps to control your entire
observatory. You can create a profile of which devices are going to be used, and then start
the INDI library and connect to those devices. You then can start collecting data from
the sensor devices you defined in the profile.
</p>

<p>
Although several options are available for doing astronomy from the desktop, if you're
already using the KDE environment, you definitely should look at KStars. It has all of
the usual features that you will need, and it's tightly integrated
to the KDE environment of applications. Visit <a href="https://edu.kde.org/kstars">https://edu.kde.org/kstars</a> for more
information.
