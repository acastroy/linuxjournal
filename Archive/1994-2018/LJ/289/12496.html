<p>
It would be an understatement to say that artificial intelligence (AI) is
much in the news these days. It's widely viewed as likely to usher in the
next big step-change in computing, but a recent interesting 
development in the field has particular implications for open source.
It concerns the rise of "ethical" AI. 
</p>

<p>
In October 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the
European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and, in the UK, the House
of Commons' Science and Technology Committee, all released reports on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2906249">how to
prepare for the future of AI</a>, with ethical issues being an important
component
of those reports. At the beginning of last year, the <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/?cn-reloaded=1">Asilomar AI
Principles</a> were published, followed by the <a href="https://www.montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration">Montreal
Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence</a>,
announced in November 2017. 
</p>

<p>
Abstract discussions of what ethical AI might or should mean became very real
in March 2018. It was revealed then that Google had won a share of
the contract for the <a href="https://www.govexec.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/establishment_of_the_awcft_project_maven.pdf">Pentagon's
Project Maven</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to interpret huge
quantities of video images collected by aerial drones in order <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-is-helping-the-pentagon-build-ai-for-drones-1823464533">to
improve the targeting of subsequent drone strikes</a>. When this became
known, it caused a firestorm at Google. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html">Thousands
of people there signed an internal petition</a> addressed to the company's
CEO, Sundar Pichai, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/technology/googleletter.pdf">asking
him to cancel the project</a>. Hundreds of researchers and academics sent an
<a href="https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers">open
letter supporting them</a>, and some <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300">Google
employees resigned in protest</a>. 
</p>

<p>
It later emerged that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/05/31/google-leaked-emails-drone-ai-pentagon-lucrative">Google
had hoped to win further defense work</a> worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. However, in the face of the massive protests, Google management
announced that it <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620">would
not be seeking any further Project Maven contracts</a> after the present one
expires in 2019. And in an attempt to answer criticisms that it was straying
far from its original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil">"don't be evil"</a>
motto, Pichai posted <a href="https://blog.google/topics/ai/ai-principles">"AI at Google: our
principles"</a>, although <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2018/06/08/googles-ai-principles-7-shades-of-gray-area">some
were unimpressed</a>.  
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2018/05/in-chinas-footsteps-amazon-and-us-schools-normalize-automatic-facial-recognition-and-constant-surveillance">Amazon</a>
and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/microsoft-employees-up-in-arms-over-cloud-contract-with-1826927803">Microsoft</a>
also are grappling with similar issues about what constitutes ethical use of
their AI technologies. But the situation with Google is different, because
key to the Project Maven deal with the Pentagon is open-source
software—<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">Google's TensorFlow</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
...an open source software library for high performance numerical
computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation
across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit">tensor processing
units</a>]), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge
devices. Originally developed by researchers and engineers from the Google
Brain team within Google's AI organization, it comes with strong support
for machine learning and deep learning, and the flexible numerical computation
core is used across many other scientific domains.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It's long been accepted that the creators of open-source projects cannot stop their code
from being used for purposes with which they may not agree or even strongly
condemn—that's why it's called free software.  But the use by Google
of open-source
AI tools for work with the Pentagon does raise a new question. What exactly
does the rise of "ethical" AI imply for the Open Source world, and how should
the community respond?
</p>

<p>
Ethical AI represents a significant opportunity for open source. One
important aspect of "ethical" is transparency. For example, the Asilomar AI
Principles include the following:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
7) <b>Failure Transparency</b>: If an AI system causes harm, it
should be possible to ascertain why.
</p>

<p>
8) <b>Judicial Transparency</b>: Any involvement by an autonomous system in
judicial decision-making should provide a satisfactory explanation auditable
by a competent human authority.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More generally, people are recognizing that "black box" AI approaches are
unacceptable. If such systems are to be deployed in domains where the
consequences can be serious and dangerous—perhaps a matter of life or
death, as in drone attacks—independent experts must have the ability to
scrutinize the underlying software and its operation. The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/emmanuel-macron-talks-to-wired-about-frances-ai-strategy">French</a>
and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/6-make-your-work-transparent-and-be-accountable">British</a>
governments already have committed to opening up their algorithms in this
way. Open-source software provides a natural foundation for an ethical
approach based on transparency.
</p>

<p>
The current interest in ethical AI means the Open Source community should
push for the underlying code to be released under a free software license.
Although that goes beyond simple transparency, the manifest success of the
open-source methodology in every computing domain (with the possible
exception of the desktop), lends weight to the argument that doing so is good
not just for transparency, but for efficiency too.
</p>

<p>
However, as well as a huge opportunity, AI also represents a real threat to
free software—not directly, but by virtue of the fact that most of the big
breakthroughs in the field are being made by companies with extensive
resources. They naturally are interested in making money from AI, so
they see
it ultimately as just part of the research and development work that will
lead to new products. That contrasts with Linux, say, which is first and
foremost a community project that involves large-scale—and
welcome—collaboration with industry. Currently missing are major open-source
AI projects running independently of any company.
</p>

<p>
There have been some moves to bring the worlds of open source and AI together.
For example, in March 2018, The Linux Foundation launched the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/the-linux-foundation-and-open-source-community-members-launch-lf-deep-learning-to-drive-open-source-growth-in-ai">LF
Deep Learning Foundation</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
...an umbrella organization that will support and sustain open
source innovation in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep
learning while striving to make these critical new technologies available to
developers and data scientists everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Founding members of LF Deep Learning include Amdocs, AT&amp;T, B.Yond, Baidu,
Huawei, Nokia, Tech Mahindra, Tencent, Univa, and ZTE. With LF Deep Learning,
members are working to create a neutral space where makers and sustainers of
tools and infrastructure can interact and harmonize their efforts and
accelerate the broad adoption of deep learning technologies.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As part of that initiative, The Linux Foundation also announced <a href="https://www.acumos.org">Acumos AI</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
...a platform and open source framework that makes it easy to build,
share, and deploy AI apps. Acumos standardizes the infrastructure stack and
components required to run an out-of-the-box general AI environment. This
frees data scientists and model trainers to focus on their core competencies
and accelerates innovation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Both of those are welcome steps, but the list of founding members emphasizes
once more how the organization is dominated by companies—many of them from
China, which is emerging as a leader in this space. That's no coincidence.
As the <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Deciphering_Chinas_AI-Dream.pdf">"Deciphering
China's AI Dream"</a> report explains, the Chinese government has made it
clear that it wants to be an AI "superpower" and is prepared to expend money
and energy to that end. Things are made easier by the country's limited
privacy protection laws. As a result, huge quantities of data, including
personal data, are available for training AI systems—a real boon for
local researchers. Crucially, AI is seen as a tool for social control.
Applications include pre-emptive censorship, <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/11/chinas-censorship-czar-falls-police-cloud-tracking-system-rises-across-country">predictive
policing</a> and the introduction of a <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit">"social credit
system"</a> that will constantly monitor and evaluate the activities of
Chinese citizens, rank their level of trustworthiness and reward or punish
them accordingly.
</p>

<p>
Given the Chinese authorities' published priorities, it is unlikely that the
development of AI technologies by local companies will pay more than lip
service to ethical issues. As the recent incidents involving Google, Amazon
and Microsoft indicate, it's not clear that Western companies will do much
better. That leaves a vitally important role for open source—to act as
beacon of responsible AI software development. That can be achieved only if
leaders step forward to propose and initiate ambitious AI projects, and if the
coding community embraces and helps realize those plans. If this doesn't
happen, 30 years of work in freeing software and its users could be
rendered moot by a new generation of inscrutable black boxes running
closed-source code—and the world.
