<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">What's New in Kernel Development By Zack Brown</h2>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">New Intel Caching Feature Considered for Mainline</h3>

<p><em>
These days, <strong>Intel</strong>'s name is Mud in various circles because
of the
<strong>Spectre/Meltdown</strong> CPU flaws and other similar hardware issues
that seem to
be emerging as well. But, there was a recent discussion between some Intel
folks and the kernel folks that was not related to those things. Some
thrust-and-parry still was going on between kernel person and company person,
but it
seemed more to do with trying to get past marketing speak, than at wrestling
over what Intel is doing to fix its longstanding hardware flaws.</em></p>

<p>
<strong>Reinette Chatre</strong> of Intel posted a patch for a new chip
feature called <strong>Cache
Allocation Technology</strong> (CAT), which "enables a user to specify the
amount of
cache space into which an application can fill". Among other things, Reinette
offered the disclaimer, "The cache pseudo-locking approach relies on
generation-specific behavior of processors. It may provide benefits on
certain processor generations, but is not guaranteed to be supported in the
future."
</p>

<p>
<strong>Thomas Gleixner</strong> thought Intel's work looked very interesting
and in general
very useful, but he asked, "are you saying that the CAT mechanism might
change radically in the future [that is, in future CPU chip designs] so that
access to cached data in an allocated area which does not belong to the
current executing context won't work anymore?"
</p>

<p>
Reinette replied, "Cache Pseudo-Locking is a model-specific feature so there
may be some variation in if, or to what extent, current and future devices
can support Cache Pseudo-Locking. CAT remains architectural."
</p>

<p>
Thomas replied, "that does NOT answer my question at all."
</p>

<p>
At this point, <strong>Gavin Hindman</strong> of Intel joined the discussion,
saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Support
in a current generation of a product line doesn't imply support in a future
generation. Certainly we'll make every effort to carry support forward, and
would adjust to any changes in CAT support, but we can't account for
unforeseen future architectural changes that might block pseudo-locking
use-cases on top of CAT.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And Thomas replied, "that's the real problem. We add something that gives us
some form of isolation, but we don't know whether next generation CPUs will
work. From a maintainability and usefulness POV, that's not a really great
prospect."
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere in a parallel part of the discussion, Thomas asked, "Are there real
world use cases that actually can benefit from this [CAT feature] and what
are those applications supposed to do once the feature breaks with future
generations of processors?"
</p>

<p>
Reinette replied, "This feature is model-specific with a few platforms
supporting it at this time. Only platforms known to support Cache
Pseudo-Locking will expose its resctrl interface."
</p>

<p>
To which Thomas said, "you deliberately avoided to answer my question again."
</p>

<p>
Gavin replied now, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Reinette's not trying to avoid the questions, we
just don't necessarily have definitive answers at this time. Currently
pseudo-locking requires manual setup on the part of the integrator, so there
will not be any invisible breakage when trying to port software expecting
pseudo-locking to new devices, and we'll certainly do everything we can to
minimize user-space/configuration impact on migration if things change going
forward, but these are unknowns. We are in a bit of chicken/egg where people
aren't broadly using it because it's not architectural, and it's not
architectural because people aren't broadly using it. We could publicly
carry the patches out of mainline, but our intent for pushing the patches to
mainline are to a) increase exposure/usage, b) reduce divergence across people
already using hacked versions, and c) ease the overhead in keeping patches in
sync with the larger CAT infrastructure as it evolves - we are clear on the
potential support burden being incurred by submitting a non-architectural
feature, and there's certainly no intent to dump a science-experiment into
mainline.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thomas replied, "Ok. So what you are saying is that 'official' support should
broaden the user base, which in turn might push it into the architectural
realm. I'll go through the patch set with this in mind."
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Thomas and Reinette went through a more technical exchange of
data, and Reinette provided useful data points for understanding the value of
the CAT feature itself. To all of this, Thomas said, "Very nice. Thank you so
much for doing this. That kind of data is really valuable. My take away from
this: All of the mechanisms are only delivering best effort and the real
benefit is the reduction of average latency. The worst case outliers are in
the same ballpark at seems." And, he promised to review the next version of
Intel's patch, which Reinette expected to send out within the week.
</p>

<p>
So as Intel tries to move past Spectre/Meltdown, it continues to collaborate
with kernel developers on this sort of feature. At the same time, it's hard
to forget that its hardware problems are not over, and that new CPU flaws
continue to be discovered even now. <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> has
interpreted some of
Intel's statements to mean that Intel does not intend to fix some of its
hardware flaws in future generations of CPUs, which would force kernel
developers, and developers of other operating systems, to work around those
flaws for the foreseeable future. So there's a lot of tension even in the
context of collaborating on relatively simple new features like CAT.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Supporting the NDS32 Architecture</h3>

<p><em>
<strong>Green Hu</strong> posted a patch to support the
<strong>NDS32</strong> architecture. He described the
current status as, "It is able to boot to shell and passes most LTP-2017
testsuites in nds32 AE3XX platform."</em></p>

<p>
<strong>Arnd Bergmann</strong> approved the patch, but <strong>Linus
Torvalds</strong> wanted a little more of
a description—an overview of the "uses, quirks, reasons for existing"
for
this chip, to include in the changelog.
</p>

<p>
Arnd replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The non-marketing description is that this is a fairly
conventional (in a good way) low-end RISC architecture that is usually
integrated into custom microcontroller and SoC designs, competing with the
similar ARM32, ARC, MIPS32, RISC-V, Xtensa and (currently under review) C-Sky
architectures that occupy the same space. The most interesting bit from my
perspective is that Andestech is already selling a new generation of CPU
cores that are based on 32-bit and 64-bit RISC-V, but are still supporting
enough customers on the existing cores to invest in both.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
And Green also said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Andes' nds32 architecture supports Linux for Andes' N10, D10, N13, N15, D15
processor cores.
</p>

<p>
Based on the patented 16/32-bit AndeStar RISC-like architecture, we designed
the configurable AndesCore series of embedded processor families. AndesCores
range from highly performance-efficient small-footprint cores for
microcontrollers and deeply-embedded applications to 1GHz+ cores running
Linux, covering general-purpose
N-series cores for a wide range of computing needs; DSP-capable
D-series cores for digital signal control; instruction-extensible
E-series cores for application-specific acceleration; and secure
S-series cores for best protection of the most valuable.
</p>

<p>
Our customers together have shipped over 2.5 billion SoCs with Andes
processors embedded (including non-MMU IP cores). It will help our customers
to get better Linux support if we are merged into mainline.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It looks like there's no controversy over this port, and it should fly into
the main tree. One reason for the easy adoption is that it doesn't touch any
other part of the kernel—if the patch breaks anything, it'll break only
that one architecture, so there's very little risk in letting Green make his
own choices about what to include and what to leave out. Linus' main
threshold will probably be "does it compile?" If yes, then it's okay to go in.
</p>

<p>
The situation may start to become interesting if other parts of the kernel
begin
offering special behaviors for the NDS32 architecture, and if those behaviors
start deviating too far from other architectures. For example, some
architectures have special memory managing features that the kernel proper
can take advantage of. Once NDS32 starts influencing code in other parts of
the kernel, that likely would be the time Green's patches start to get a lot
more scrutiny.
