Python's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">Benevolent
Dictator For Life (BDFL)</a> Guido van Rossum announced he's stepping down from
the role. On the <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html">Python
mailing list</a>, van Rossum said, "I would like to remove myself entirely from
the decision process. I'll still be there for a while as an ordinary core dev, and I'll
still be available to mentor people—possibly more available. But I'm basically
giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL, and you all will be on your own." 
He credits his decision to step down as partly due to his experience with the turmoil
over PEP 572: "Now that PEP 572 is done, I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for
a PEP and find that so many people despise my decisions."
van Rossum says he will not appoint a successor and leaves that to the development team
to decide upon. For old-time's sake, see <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2959"><em>Linux Journal</em>'s interview with
Guido van Rossum from 1998</a>.
