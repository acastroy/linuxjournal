<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #140, December 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>SMBFS</b></span> has been orphaned. <span   class="bold"><b>Urban Widmark</b></span>, the official maintainer, has stopped
responding to e-mail about the filesystem, and <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> has put out the
call for someone to step up and maintain this code. The situation is colored
by the fact that <span   class="bold"><b>CIFS</b></span>, a potential replacement, does not yet support the
full array of Windows variants covered by SMBFS. Apparently <span   class="bold"><b>Red Hat</b></span>
discovered this when they tried to remove SMBFS in Fedora and had to
re-enable it fairly quickly. With the CIFS developers working to extend the
number of supported systems, the situation of SMBFS is even more uncertain.
Should a new maintainer come forward? Should the code just sit quietly until
it can be replaced by CIFS? The future of this corner of the kernel seems
yet to be decided.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>linux-kernel mailing list</b></span> has
received an infusion of life. <span   class="bold"><b>Dell</b></span>
recently donated a powerful computer to host the list, and the result has
been much better latency between the time a user posts to the list, and the
time readers receive that post. Over the years, as the number of silent
readers and active posters has gone up and up and up, the hardware running
linux-kernel (and the rest of the vger mailing lists) has occasionally been
overwhelmed. Various companies always have offered generous donations when
speed or bandwidth has gotten tight to keep these lists running properly.
Dell's gift, and Red Hat's donation of a 1 gigabit network connection, should
ensure linux-kernel's smooth operation for the near-to-mid future.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael S. Tsirkin</b></span> has gone through the kernel sources, identifying and
documenting the basic stylistic standards for <span   class="bold"><b>whitespace usage</b></span>. He started
this project as a way to help his coworkers get started with kernel
development, but published the results when he realized they might actually
have a wider appeal. A set of kernel coding standards already exists in the
Documentation/CodingStyle file distributed with the official sources, but
that file neglects to cover much of the intricate details of whitespace
usage. Michael's document is a first. As soon as he posted it, a bunch of
other developers offered detailed suggestions and refinements, so the latest
version is probably quite reliable.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrea Arcangeli</b></span> has written a tool to help track how many people actually
test each new kernel. This tool, called <span   class="bold"><b>klive</b></span>, runs in user space on the
computers of willing participants and reports various system statistics to
Andrea's server at <a href="http://klive.cpushare.com" target="_self">klive.cpushare.com</a>, where the results are aggregated
and displayed. So far, more than 100 users are participating in the effort. One
problem various kernel developers have with this project is the possibility
that users might think of it as a tool to spy on them. As a result, it is
less likely that Andrea will be able to migrate his tool to a full-kernel
feature. Probably, klive will remain just a user program, unless developers'
concerns can be clearly assuaged.
</p><p>
Adrian Bunk, always on the lookout for ways to clear out kernel deadwood,
has been pushing a patch to remove support for older GCC versions. According
to Adrian, newer compilers are perfectly able to compile the kernel, and
continuing to support the older compilers results in a lot of conditional
code that makes the kernel uglier, larger and harder to maintain in some
areas. Nevertheless, it seems that many kernel developers feel quite
strongly that at the very least, <span   class="bold"><b>GCC
2.95</b></span> must continue to be supported.
GCC 2.95 is blazingly fast compared to recent
compilers, and anyone compiling multiple kernels per day (as kernel
developers are wont to do) saves considerable time by relying on GCC 2.95
instead of the more recent compilers. So it looks as though Adrian's patch
may have to wait until newer compilers can better compete for speed.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Chris Wedgwood</b></span> recommends boycotting
<span   class="bold"><b>NVIDIA</b></span> until they start releasing the
specifications needed to write open-source drivers for their hardware. This
came up recently when <span   class="bold"><b>Michael Thonke</b></span>
asked whether Linux would implement <span   class="bold"><b>NCQ
support</b></span> for NVIDIA NForce4 (CK804) SATAII-based chipsets. <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span>'s
reply was that there were no plans to implement this because there was no
documentation from NVIDIA. He also said, &ldquo;They are the only company that
gives me zero information on their SATA controllers.&rdquo; With NVIDIA apparently
so hostile to free software, Chris argues, it's up to the rest of us to send
them a message by not purchasing their hardware until they change their
tune.

<h2 class="title">Proprietary Device Drivers?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Don Marti</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #140, December 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

If you've been reading <i  >Linux Journal</i> for a while,
you'll notice that everyone here tells you to
stay away from proprietary device drivers.
Video cards, wireless network hardware and Fibre
Channel hardware have been especially problematic.
</p><p>
By releasing a proprietary driver, not only does a
vendor shut itself out of the non-x86 embedded market
and pass up free driver testing and optimization from
the experts on the linux-kernel mailing list, it's
also hurting itself with regular Linux customers too.
</p><p>
Here's what readers said in a survey (numbers
rounded):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
We don't use proprietary drivers on Linux: 20
</p></li><li><p>
We'll use a proprietary driver only if there's no
competing hardware with a GPL driver: 14
</p></li><li><p>
A proprietary driver tends to make us less likely to
buy a piece of hardware, but doesn't rule it out: 35
</p></li><li><p>
We'll use proprietary drivers only if our Linux
hardware vendor or distribution vendor commits to
supporting them: 8
</p></li><li><p>
Whether the driver is GPL or proprietary doesn't
matter in our hardware buying decisions: 20
</p></li><li><p>
We prefer proprietary drivers to GPL drivers: 0
</p></li></ul></div><p>
That last one is there for the marketing guy at an
&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; hardware vendor who told me that the
company's enterprise customers would never want GPL
drivers for their GPL OS. Sounds like you need to
get out and talk to the customers a little more, dude.
</p><p>
One support engineer at a popular enterprise
distribution told me that his group has to support
some proprietary drivers, but that when those drivers
lead to support calls, the customers ask about
alternative hardware with GPL drivers. With the
Linux hardware market at more than $4 billion a year,
letting your lawyers slap a restrictive license on
your drivers could be an expensive mistake.

<h2 class="title">Might Be Just Right</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #140, December 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

At LinuxWorld in Boston earlier this year, I got together with an old
Swedish friend. She's a nurse, not a technologist, but she was curious
about my work and the conference that brought me to town. Somewhere in
the midst of my explanation of Linux and its virtues, she said, &ldquo;Ah,
Linux is lagom&rdquo;. She explained that <span   class="emphasis"><em>lagom</em></span> is a Swedish term that
conveys a sense of balance, proportion and appropriateness. &ldquo;Not too much,
not too little...just right.&rdquo;
</p><p>
When I told her that Linus Torvalds' first language and surname were
both Swedish, she said, &ldquo;Well of course. There you go.&rdquo; (I'm
half-Swedish myself, though I'm not sure that matters.)
</p><p>
So I put the question &ldquo;Is Linux logom?&rdquo; to The Man Himself
in an e-mail.
He debugged my spelling and declined to commit:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Lagom, with an &ldquo;a&rdquo;.
</p><p>
And yes, it means &ldquo;just right&rdquo;, in the sense of &ldquo;not too much, not
too little&rdquo;. See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom</a>
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then he added, in a following e-mail:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
They still end up confusing &ldquo;lagom&rdquo; with finding
the &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; amount. That's pretty much missing
the point. It's not that something is &ldquo;lagom&rdquo;
because it's the best possible or &ldquo;optimal&rdquo;.
Quite the reverse. Something being &ldquo;lagom&rdquo; very
much involves not caring too much about what the
optimal amount even is. Or possibly questions
where &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; simply doesn't make sense.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So I began checking other sources. The best I found was from &ldquo;In Other
Words&rdquo;, published in AskOxford, published by the Oxford English
Dictionary (<a href="http://www.askoxford.com/worldofwords/wordfrom/otherwords" target="_self">www.askoxford.com/worldofwords/wordfrom/otherwords</a>). It lists
lagom
among a handful of &ldquo;the most insightful, intriguing, and satisfying
expressions on the planet&mdash;for which there are no English
equivalents&rdquo;.
It says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Swedish commentator Dr Bengt Gustavsson argued that the lagom
mentality can be seen as the trait that gives Swedish society its
characteristic stability and yet an openness to external influences.
The word alludes subconsciously to the avoidance of both conspicuous
success and humiliating failure, which is deeply ingrained in the
Swedish psyche. It is the inclination among Swedes to shun
ostentation, accept modest rewards, be good team players&mdash;to fly
beneath the radar.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beneath the Radar</em></span> was also the title of Bob Young's book about
starting and guiding Red Hat to success. Coincidence?
</p><p>
Perhaps characteristically, Linus adds these final words to the matter:
&ldquo;but whether that applies to Linux I have no idea.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">100 Million X $100 Linux Laptops</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #140, December 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

MIT's Media Lab is developing a $100 US Linux-based laptop that will
&ldquo;be able to do most everything except store huge amounts of
data&rdquo;. The units will have color displays, Wi-Fi, mesh networking,
cell-phone connectivity and &ldquo;USB ports galore&rdquo;.
</p><p>Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and co-founder of the Media Lab,
announced the initiative in January 2005 at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland. Details of the initiative were published in August
2005.
</p><p>
In a Q&amp;A that ran with the August 2005 announcement, Negroponte said,
&ldquo;...we will market the laptops in very large numbers (millions),
directly to ministries of education, which can distribute them like
textbooks.&rdquo; He also calls the project &ldquo;One Laptop Per
Child&rdquo;. The plan is to have units ready for shipment by late 2006
or early 2007. The goal is to produce and distribute 100 million of them.
</p><p>
Tom Limoncelli, co-author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Practice of System and Network
Administration</em></span>, said, &ldquo;The thought of laptops
distributed like textbooks could be as revolutionary for spreading
hardware as Linux was for spreading UNIX-like systems.&rdquo;

When I switched from Windows to GNU/Linux (Red Hat/Fedora/Debian mostly)
about five years ago, I found a vast developer's playground. It was like
the old days of Compuserve, which was a candy aisle of freeware. Free
software is still like that for me; there's a lot of it to explore, and I
can see the source code without significant restriction. I can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the
source, and I can share the source...which is something geeks love to
do. The Windows world by the mid-1990s was very closed (still is mostly),
something that's really restrictive as a developer.
