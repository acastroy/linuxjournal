Best practices for managing software license compliance in an Open Source world.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2696580.0x278e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many software developers share some common traits. Besides copious
caffeine and creative work schedules, developers like working on interesting,
new problems. They like to be as efficient and productive in their
work as possible. They never want to start from scratch either; they prefer
to cut, paste, modify and extend.
</p><p>
The best developers today are the ones
that can most effectively find, assemble and then optimize re-usable
software components&mdash;whether those components are open source
or were developed within their own organization.
A developer's skill with Google and SourceForge is now as important
as his or her knowledge of software architecture and implementation.
</p><p>
This new &ldquo;assembly&rdquo; model is fundamentally changing the way
software is designed and developed. It accelerates development, improves
software quality and reduces costs. In short, it's changing everything.
</p><p>
Software now consists of a mix of company-owned code, open-source
and commercial libraries, and code provided by outsourcers. By combining
external components with their proprietary technology, companies create
a set of mixed intellectual property, or mixed-IP assets. Best practices
for managing software licensing in this new mixed-IP environment are now
emerging.
</p><p>
All software&mdash;whether commercial or open
source&mdash;carries licensing
obligations that companies must comply with. This new, mixed-IP environment
adds complexity to the process by mixing together licenses of all kinds.
Managing these licenses and their restrictions needs to be done correctly
in order to keep companies&mdash;and individual developers&mdash;out of trouble.
</p><p>
Following is a set of software compliance management &ldquo;best
practices&rdquo; that were developed through discussions I've had with
companies that are best in the world at leveraging this new environment:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Re-use existing components&mdash;to lower
development costs, accelerate time to market, improve quality and reduce
business risk, use existing internal and external components wherever
appropriate. Explicitly consider functionality, performance, reliability,
maturity, risk, sensitivity and license obligations.
</p></li><li><p>
Track and control changes to internal components&mdash;to establish
and maintain the provenance of all internal components, to identify and
protect critical IP and to avoid inadvertent violations of licenses,
trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets. Track internal
component creation and modification and control the modification of
those that are sensitive.
</p></li><li><p>
Control re-use of sensitive or external components&mdash;to avoid
last-minute surprises, guesswork, compromises and risk-taking, and
to prevent the loss of intellectual property and facilitate timely and
effective remediation. Review and approve the use of any external or
sensitive internal components or fragments in a project.
</p></li><li><p>
Verify every build and release&mdash;to assure prompt discovery
of materials inadvertently included in a project and unapproved or
precluded modifications to components. Identify and remediate all
unapproved components or fragments and changes made to any of those
components. Record the metadata for all external components in the
associated bill of materials.
</p></li><li><p>
Review compliance at project phase transitions&mdash;to prevent loss of
intellectual property and to assure prompt discovery of new components
inadvertently included in the project. At major development milestones,
verify that no unapproved components are used in the project or were
changed and then used. Review the license obligations of all external
components used in the project and ensure compliance with them.
</p></li><li><p>
Control component contribution and disposition&mdash;to avoid license
violations and the attendant disruptions and to constrain the propagation
of risky software. Before contributing any component or fragment to
an open-source project or transferring ownership to another party,
assess the sensitivity of that material. Verify your rights to make
that contribution or transfer.
</p></li><li><p>
Assess software components before acquisition&mdash;to prevent negative
post-acquisition surprises. Before buying a software component, identify
all internal and external components used in that asset. Identify all
external components used in any active project and assess their license
obligations with respect to compliance, business objectives and legal
policies. Assess the impact of any required rework or change on cost,
revenue, quality and so forth.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
These best practices encourage the use of open source and re-use of
software components, while assuring compliance with license obligations.
They also protect an organization's intellectual property assets.
In addition to adopting these best practices, many organizations are
using commercially available automated solutions as platforms on which
to establish and manage these processes.
</p><p>
Open-source software and component re-use are here to stay. Now is
the time for companies to begin thinking about how they will alter
their management of software IP so they can capitalize on this new
development model. By doing so, they will get ahead of the issue and
put the power of open source to work for their organizations.
