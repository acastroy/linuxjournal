Reuven Lerner continues his series on Ruby on Rails with this look at database integrity checking using ActiveRecord.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2491580.0x25893f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the past few months, we have been looking at Ruby on Rails, the
hot new open-source toolkit for creating Web/database applications.
One of the core elements of this toolkit, as we saw last issue, is the
ActiveRecord class, which automatically translates between Ruby
objects and data in a relational database. Object-relational mappers,
as such software is often known, bridges the gap between the
object-oriented and relational worlds, which treat data in
fundamentally different ways.
</p><p>
This month, we look at some of the ways we can modify
ActiveRecord to validate our data in various ways. We also see
how we can work with classes that depend on one another, doing
something a bit more sophisticated than the basic scaffolding provides
with only a few simple lines of code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2491580.0x2589558"></a>
Primary Keys</h2></div></div><p>
When I first started to work with relational databases, I would create
tables that looked like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    first_name    TEXT  NOT NULL,
    last_name     TEXT  NOT NULL,
    phone_number  TEXT  NOT NULL,
    email_address TEXT  NOT NULL
);
</pre>
</p><p>
And of course, the above definition of People will work just
fine, providing the basis for a computerized address book.
However, the above definition has several problems. To
begin with, what happens if there is more than one person with the
same name? That is, if we have two people named George Washington
in our database, we're going to have a serious problem. How will we
know which is the George we want?
</p><p>
The solution to this problem is to assign a unique number to each
record in the database. Each relational database product has a
different way of accomplishing this. In PostgreSQL, we add a new
column and assign it a SERIAL type, indicating that it should be a
nonrepeating integer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id            SERIAL   NOT NULL,
    first_name    TEXT   NOT NULL,
    last_name     TEXT   NOT NULL,
    phone_number  TEXT   NOT NULL,
    email_address TEXT   NOT NULL
);
</pre>
</p><p>
We then tell PostgreSQL that it should consider id to be not just
another column, but the primary key, an identifier that is
guaranteed to be unique and that can serve as identification for one
row in the table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id            SERIAL   NOT NULL,
    first_name    TEXT   NOT NULL,
    last_name     TEXT   NOT NULL,
    phone_number  TEXT   NOT NULL,
    email_address TEXT   NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
Although we can now find people in our address book with their first or
last names, we also can do so using their unique ID. Even if there
are 100,000 people named George Washington in our database, we can
unambiguously find the one that interests us using the id column.
Think of the times you have been asked to identify yourself using a
driver's license number, a national ID number or a Social Security
number, and you quickly will realize that each of these can be used as
a primary key in a database.
</p><p>
One additional result of this constraint is that the database creates
an index for the id column. Even if you have a very large table of
addresses, the fact that id is indexed means that the database can
use it to find records quickly. In addition, although SERIAL columns can
be set manually in an INSERT statement, just like INTEGER columns,
they're normally not set explicitly at all. Rather, PostgreSQL assigns
the next consecutive integer to be the column value&mdash;perfect for a
primary key, whose value must be unique.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2491580.0x2589920"></a>
Foreign Keys</h2></div></div><p>
Primary keys are useful in this way, but we have not yet begun to
understand their power. That's because primary keys really come into
their own when they make it possible for us to link tables together.
For example, consider a computerized appointment calendar that we
might want to build as an add-on module to our existing address book.
We could create a table like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    id        SERIAL    NOT NULL,
    person_id INTEGER   NOT NULL,
    start_at  TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    comment   TEXT,

    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
The above table has an id column, uniquely identifying every
appointment. It also has two columns identifying the time at which
the appointment starts and ends, as well as room for an optional
comment or description.
</p><p>
But there is also a person_id column, which allows us to indicate
with whom we will be meeting.
This database design has a number of problems, but perhaps the most striking one is that there
is no constraint (other than NOT NULL) on the value that we can assign
to person_id. Even if our People table is empty, we can assign
person_id to be 10, 100 or 996&mdash;these numbers might be
acceptable technically, but they don't help us ensure that person_id refers to an
actual person.
</p><p>
The solution is to define person_id as a foreign key, indicating
that values of person_id are legitimate only if they reflect an
existing value in the People table. In PostgreSQL, we accomplish
this as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    id        SERIAL    NOT NULL,
    person_id INTEGER   NOT NULL  REFERENCES People,
    start_at  TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    comment   TEXT,

    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
With these conditions in place, we can be sure that we will be
able to make an appointment only with someone in our address book. What
happens if we try to get around it? Let's see:

<pre     class="programlisting">

INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name,
                         phone_number, email_address)
    VALUES ('George', 'Washington',
            '202-555-1212', 'first.prez@whitehouse.gov');

</pre>
</p><p>
When we SELECT the elements of our database table, we can see the
value that was automatically assigned to our id column:

<pre     class="programlisting">
 id | first_name | last_name  | phone_number |       email_address
----+------------+------------+--------------+---------------------------
  1 | George     | Washington | 202-555-1212 |  first.prez@whitehouse.gov
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's insert an appointment with George:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Appointments (person_id, start_at, end_at, comment)
VALUES (1, '2005-Oct-2 18:00', '2005-Oct-2 20:00', 'Dinner');
</pre>
</p><p>
So far, so good. But, what happens if we try to insert an appointment
with a nonexistent person?

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Appointments (person_id, start_at, end_at, comment)
VALUES (200, '2005-Nov-2 18:00', '2005-Nov-2 20:00',
            'Dinner with no one');
</pre>
</p><p>
PostgreSQL rejects our INSERT statement, saying that inserting the row
would violate the constraint introduced with the REFERENCES command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ERROR:  insert or update on table "appointments" violates foreign key
constraint "appointments_person_id_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (person_id)=(200) is not present in table "addressbook".
</pre>
</p><p>
What happens if we try to remove George from our People table
while we have an appointment with him?

<pre     class="programlisting">
DELETE FROM People WHERE id = 1;
</pre>
</p><p>
Once again, PostgreSQL rejects our request, indicating this time that
we cannot remove an item that is being pointed to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ERROR:  update or delete on "addressbook" violates foreign key
constraint "appointments_person_id_fkey" on "appointments"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(1) is still referenced from table "appointments".
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2491580.0x258a0b0"></a>
ActiveRecord and Foreign Keys</h2></div></div><p>
All of the constraints we have seen so far have been at the level
of the database, rather than any application using that database.
This potentially means trouble for the users of those applications
who don't have access to the database definitions. After all, what is
supposed to happen if the application tries to insert, delete or
modify a row such that it violates a constraint?
</p><p>
The simple answer, and one that is still prevalent in a surprisingly
large number of Web/database operations, is that the program simply
reports an error. (Sometimes it even will indicate what the error
was, needlessly exposing the offending SQL statement for everyone to
see.) In some cases, the application indicates that there was a
database problem, or something of the sort.
</p><p>
But, what we really would like is to avoid those sorts of database
problems altogether. We would prefer to have the constraints in
our database somehow be propagated to the application level, letting
the application catch problems before they ever get to the database
level.
</p><p>
Although ActiveRecord cannot do this, it comes very close, making it
almost trivially simple for us to represent relationships between
tables in a Rails application. Let's now create a simple Rails
application that uses ActiveRecord to keep track of our address book
and calendar information.
</p><p>
We begin by creating the skeleton Rails application by typing <tt  >rails
addressbook</tt>, which creates an addressbook directory and puts
everything underneath that. Then, we modify config/database.yml to
point to development, testing and production databases in the
appropriate place. (See last month's At the Forge for an example of what
database.yml should look like.)
</p><p>
Now, let's create basic models, controllers and views for the People
and Appointment tables. We could use the script/generate program
that comes with Rails to create them separately. But in many cases,
it's easiest to create a bare-bones application, or scaffold:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/generate scaffold Person
ruby script/generate scaffold Appointment
</pre>
</p><p>
We can now start the test server on port 3000 (script/server); going
to /People shows the current list of people and
lets us create a new person. Click on the new person link, and you will see
the page the scaffolding created. However, not all is perfect
here&mdash;what happens if you click on the create button at the bottom
of the page without entering anything in the text fields?
</p><p>
Assuming the definition of the People table described earlier, Rails
will create a new person whose fields are all the empty string. We
could solve the problem by modifying the definition of the People
table, adding checks to ensure that the contents of each field is a
non-empty string&mdash;but if we were to do this, Rails would show us the
database error, complaining that we had violated an integrity
constraint.
</p><p>
The solution is to modify the Person object so that it catches
such errors, forcing the user to enter something in each field. We do
this by modifying the Person class definition, located in
app/models/person.rb. When we first open person.rb, we see that it
is an unchanged subclass of ActiveRecord::Base:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

</pre>
</p><p>
We can add one of the built-in Rails validators, statements that allow
us to check the integrity of the data at the application level, before
it ever gets to the database level. In this case, we use
validates_presence_of, naming each of the fields from our table:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_presence_of :first_name, :last_name,
                          :email_address, :phone_number
end

</pre>
</p><p>
With this in place&mdash;and without even having to restart the
server&mdash;we can try adding another blank person. But now we find that Rails
has stopped us, explaining the problem (for example, &ldquo;Phone number can't be
blank&rdquo;) at the top of the form and outlining each of the offending
fields in red. With this validator in place, we can be sure that all
of the rows in the People table will contain valid data.
</p><p>
When we go to /Appointments to add a new appointment, something
seems suspicious even before we click on the create button at the
bottom of the page: there isn't anywhere that we can enter the person
with whom we are meeting! This will cause problems, as clicking on
the create button quickly demonstrates; PostgreSQL returns an error,
which Rails displays for all to see. Clearly, we need to solve
this problem.
</p><p>
The problem is that the view for creating new instances of the
Appointment class (that is, app/views/appointments/new.rhtml) is missing
an HTML form element named appointment[person_id]. If new.rhtml
were to include appointment[person_id], it would be submitted
along with the rest of the elements of the form and inserted into the
database.
</p><p>
The thing is, appointment[person_id] should be populated from the
database. Assuming that we have a variable named @people available to
us, we could add something like this to new.rhtml right before the
call to submit_tag:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;b&gt;Person:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;select name="appointment[person_id]"&gt;
    &lt;option value=""&gt;Select a person&lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;% @people.each do |person| %&gt;
    &lt;option value="&lt;%= person.id %&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;%= person.first_name %&gt;
    &lt;/option&gt;
    &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;/select&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The above RHTML code is similar to JSP and ASP in that it embeds Ruby
code inside of an HTML document. Code surrounded by &lt;% %&gt; is executed
in place, while code surrounded by &lt;%= %&gt; is replaced by its return
value.
</p><p>
The above code thus defines an HTML form element named
appointment[person_id]. It then creates an option with a blank value.
Next, we get into a standard Ruby idiom, iterating over the elements of
a list, using person as an iterator, pulling out person.id as the
value and person.first_name as the text. In other words, we create a
&lt;select&gt; list of the people in our People table.
</p><p>
But where does @people come from? We have to define it, but we can do
that inside of the Appointments controller object,
app/controllers/appointments_controller.rb. That file contains all of
the methods the scaffolding system created for us. We merely
have to add one line to the new method definition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@people = Person.find_all
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we know that @people is a variable we're defining, and we know
that Person is a subclass of ActiveRecord::Base that hooks us to the
People table in our database. The find_all method returns all of the
elements in the table.
</p><p>
Finally, we modify our data model class, appointment.rb, adding a
validator to ensure that we will have nonblank values for each of the
fields:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Appointment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_presence_of :start_at, :end_at, :comment, :person_id
end

</pre>
</p><p>
With all of this in place, we can begin to schedule appointments.
Each appointment will be with a single person, and we can be sure that
it will contain all of the data that we want. Moreover, we know that
by the time PostgreSQL receives the data to be inserted, it will be
valid.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although constraints in our database ensure that the data will always be
valid, we generally want to perform such validation at the application
level. Unfortunately, doing so is tricky or time consuming in many
languages. ActiveRecord, the object-relational mapper at the heart of
Ruby on Rails, makes it relatively easy to ensure that your users
never have to see a database error. It comes with a number of
validators, as well as an infrastructure for creating custom ones.
Moreover, it comes with a number of routines that let us describe
the relationships among different tables. With some small
modifications to the controllers, views and models, we are able to
create a custom application with valid data quickly.
