</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #140, December 2005</div></div><div><p>
Author Ti Leggett presents the first in a series of articles focused on
building a secure corporate directory, including support for single-sign-on that's scalable up to thousands of users.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe492f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
So you want a corporate directory, but you don't have a corporate
budget. You want to reap the benefits of single sign-on, the ease of
administration for yourself and the ease of use for your users. If
you want all this, plus a secure and unified authorization and identity
management system, read on. I'll start you down the path to sysadmin
nirvana. In this series of articles, I'll show you how to build on pieces
you may already have in place, add new pieces and make them all work
together. Everything from the authentication servers, to mail delivery,
to client integration (including Windows and OS X) will be discussed. We
have a lot to cover, so let's get started!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe493f8"></a>
Using Previous Building Blocks</h2></div></div><p>
We use MIT Kerberos V v1.4.1 and OpenLDAP v2.1.30 running
on Gentoo Linux as our authentication and identity management systems,
respectively. I assume you have three servers: kdc.example.com,
ldap.example.com and mail.example.com. Before we go any further, you
should first read the <i  >Linux Journal</i> articles &ldquo;Centralized Authentication with Kerberos 5, Part
I&rdquo; and
&ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere&rdquo; (see the on-line Resources). We build on where
those articles leave off, but
keep in mind that our Kerberos realm will be CI.EXAMPLE.COM, and our base
DN will be o=ci,dc=example,dc=com. Also, all of the configuration files
referred to in this article are available from the on-line Resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe49608"></a>
Setting Up an SSL Certificate Authority (CA)</h2></div></div><p>
This section is optional reading but is highly recommended for sites
that will have many servers using SSL. Each server can self-sign its
own certificate, but you lose unity and some of the power of running
your own CA. If you're interested in the details of OpenSSL, I highly
recommend the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Network Security with OpenSSL</em></span>.
</p><p>
We start by choosing /etc/ssl/example.com as the base directory to
store all the signed certificates, certificate revocation lists (CRLs)
and accounting information. Once that directory is created, we then
create the directories certs, crl, newcerts and private underneath the
base. We create an empty file /etc/ssl/example.com/index.txt, and then create
a file /etc/ssl/example.com/serial:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# touch /etc/ssl/example.com/index.txt
# echo '01' &gt; /etc/ssl/example.com/serial
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we create the CA's OpenSSL configuration file,
/etc/ssl/example.com/ca-ssl.cnf.
</p><p>
To create a self-signed CA certificate, we must do the following as
the user who owns the /etc/ssl/example.com directory and its children,
which is probably root:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/example.com/ca-ssl.cnf
# openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -newkey rsa \
 -out /etc/ssl/example.com/ci-cert.pem -outform PEM
# cp /etc/ssl/example.com/ci-cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs
# /usr/bin/c_rehash /etc/ssl/certs

</pre>
</p><p>
For more details on the openssl req command, view the req(1) man page.
</p><p>
It is important to keep the passphrase for the CA key in a very safe
place,
because if the CA private key is compromised, all previously signed certs
cannot be trusted. It is also important to keep the actual CA machine and
access to it secure. How secure you keep the machine is up to you and
your actual security needs, but if unauthorized users gain physical
or network access, they have access to the CA private key. As I mentioned
above, compromise of the CA private key compromises the entire chain of
trust, making all signed certificates suspect and untrustworthy. Some
suggest that the CA machine be physically secured with no network
access. In order to sign certificates in this environment, you use
registration authorities (RAs) to receive certificate signing requests
(CSRs). The CSRs are then transferred to some secure portable media that
is taken to the CA where the CSRs are signed, and the certificates
written back to the portable media to be placed back on the RA for the
end user to retrieve. If you think your needs might require this, the
OpenCA Project was designed with this type of security in mind. It also
has support for storage of signed certificates in LDAP.
</p><p>
We have created an OpenSSL configuration file for our CA, but that
describes only how to request and sign exactly one certificate. We still
need to create an OpenSSL configuration to use from now on to request
normal host and user certificates: /etc/ssl/example.conf/ssl.cnf. The
client configuration is a little more complex than the CA's because more
variations can occur for client certificates.
</p><p>
Now that we have a client configuration file, let's generate a host
certificate for the LDAP server. Generating a CSR can be done as a
normal user:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/example.com/ssl.cnf
# openssl req -new -nodes -keyout ldap-key.pem \
 -out ldap-req.pem

</pre>
</p><p>
The openssl options used are much the same as those used for generating
the CA CSR. The only new option is the -nodes option, which creates an
unencrypted private key.
</p><p>
Our next step is to have the CSR signed by the CA in order to get the
public certificate. This, again, needs to be done as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# export OPENSSL_CONF=/etc/ssl/example.com/ssl.cnf
# openssl ca -policy policy_anything -out \
 ldap-cert.pem -in ldap-req.pem

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, we have three files: ldap-cert.pem, the public certificate;
ldap-key.pem, the private key; and ldap-req.pem, the CSR. The CSR can
be thrown away once the certificate has been signed by the CA. Again,
protecting the private key is important, especially because it is not
encrypted. It probably should be owned by root and have permissions 0400.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe49c38"></a>
Securing LDAP</h2></div></div><p>
Even though passwords aren't stored in the LDAP directory, a lot of
sensitive information is. Your users probably don't want the whole
Internet to know their phone numbers, e-mail addresses or employee IDs. Once you've
read &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere&rdquo; and have a working LDAP server, you need
to secure the information transportation and access to the directory.
</p><p>
The first step is to secure the data transport using OpenSSL. First,
let's copy our certificate and key we signed previously to
/etc/openldap/ssl/slapd-cert.pem and /etc/openldap/ssl/slapd-key.pem,
respectively. We need to provide five options in slapd.conf:
TLSCipherSuite (optional), TLSCACertificatePath, TLSCertificateFile,
TLSCertificateKeyFile and TLSVerifyClient. The slapd.conf(5) man page
has good definitions of these options.
</p><p>
Having secured the data on the wire, we now secure authentication using
the Kerberos KDC. OpenLDAP is Kerberized and uses SASL for authentication
negotiation. We first must tell slapd how to find its Kerberos keytab
file. We do this by editing /etc/conf.d/slapd or by defining KRB5_KTNAME
prior to starting slapd in its init script. Two options in slapd.conf
also must be defined: sasl-secprops and sasl-regexp.
</p><p>
Right now, TLS and SASL can be used but aren't required. Two more options
in slapd.conf, security and allow, are used to specify the security
methods and encryption strength needed for certain operations to
take place. And, be sure to set up access control lists (ACLs)
properly&mdash;refer to slapd.access(5).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe49ea0"></a>
Securely Replicating Kerberos</h2></div></div><p>
We start by replicating our Kerberos database from kdc.example.com to
ldap.example.com, so that if kdc.example.com fails, ldap.example.com will
pick up the slack. One important fact to remember is that only one kadmin
server can be on the network for a realm at any time. Otherwise, there is
no authoritative source for updates to the database. Kerberos comes with
kprop and kpropd to propagate the Kerberos database securely. First
we must identify kpropd as a known service. Add the following to
/etc/services:

<pre     class="programlisting">
krb5_prop             754/tcp
</pre>
</p><p>
We need to define an ACL file, /etc/krb5kdc/kpropd.acl, that tells kpropd
what hosts are allowed to propagate. All that is really needed in this
file is the master KDC's principal name, but it doesn't hurt to have all
KDCs in here so that if a failure occurs, we can choose a new master,
start the kadmin service on it and propagate from that host to the
other slaves.
</p><p>
We now create an xinetd service definition, /etc/xinetd.d/kpropd, on
our slaves; (re)start xinetd; dump the database on kdc.example.com;
and propagate it to the slaves so they have an initial configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# /usr/sbin/kdb5_util dump /etc/krb5kdc/slavedump
# /usr/sbin/kprop -f /etc/krb5kdc/slavedump \
 ldap.example.com

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we create a stash file on each slave using the master key
defined when setting up kdc.example.com's database, and then start the
kdc service:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /usr/sbin/kdb5_util stash
# /etc/init.d/mit-krb5kdc start
</pre>
</p><p>
To propagate out the KDC database periodically, we define a cron job
on kdc.example.com. Thanks to Jason Garman and the O'Reilly book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Kerberos: The Definitive Guide</em></span> for the original cron job.
</p><p>
A sensible time frame to run this script is hourly or from
/etc/cron.hourly. Our Kerberos database is now being replicated
securely from the master to any number of slaves. If the master fails, we have
a way to switch to a slave machine quickly and with minimal data loss,
if any. Now that we're propagating Kerberos changes, we can add the
slave server to the krb5.conf file as a valid KDC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe4a2c0"></a>
Securely Replicating OpenLDAP</h2></div></div><p>
Enough critical information will be stored in your LDAP directory that
you probably don't want a single point of failure. After all, if your
LDAP directory is unavailable, your users won't be able to login, check
e-mail or do numerous other daily tasks. Replicating your LDAP directory
helps ensure there is no single point of failure.
</p><p>
Let's replicate the LDAP directory from ldap.example.com to
kdc.example.com. OpenLDAP has a d&aelig;mon called slurpd that is responsible
for this. Unfortunately, slurpd has no configuration directive telling it
which Kerberos keytab to use, so there's a bit of work required. First,
we edit slapd.conf on ldap.example.com, adding the options replogfile
and replica, and then we restart slapd.
</p><p>
We need to create a Kerberos ldap service principal and SSL certificate
and key for kdc.example.com, as we did for ldap.example.com. We
also must create a slapd.conf file for kdc.example.com. This file
is almost identical to the one on ldap.example.com, with a few key
differences. For the same reason we have only one Kerberos admin server,
we want only one LDAP directory being updated and changed. The only
user who should be able to write to the slaves' directory should be
uid=host/ldap.example.com,cn=GSSAPI,cn=auth or the Kerberos principal of
the master, so our ACLs on the slaves are much more restrictive. Also,
slapd needs to know who will be sending updates via slurp as defined by
the updatedn and updateref options.
</p><p>
Now we switch our focus back to ldap.example.com for a bit. We need to
create an /etc/conf.d/slurpd or make sure that KRB5CCNAME is set before
slurpd is started from the init script.
</p><p>
Next, we get some initial Kerberos credentials:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# KRB5CCNAME=/var/run/slurpd.krb5cache /usr/bin/kinit -k
</pre>
</p><p>
And then we dump the directory to a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ldap# /etc/init.d/slapd stop
ldap# /usr/sbin/slapcat -l /tmp/slavedump.ldif
ldap# /etc/init.d/slurpd start
</pre>
</p><p>
Because slurpd transfers changes only in the master directory, we need
to populate the slave directory with the current state of the master
directory. We do this by copying a dump of the master we created above,
/tmp/slavedump.ldif, to kdc.example.com and import the dumped directory
and start slapd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kdc# /usr/sbin/slapadd -l slavedump.ldif
kdc# /etc/init.d/slapd start
ldap# /etc/init.d/slapd start
</pre>
</p><p>
We need to test that the slave has a sane directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ldapsearch -H ldap://kdc.example.com -ZZ
</pre>
</p><p>
To test that replication is happening, we can make a modification
or addition to the directory on ldap.example.com and then search on
kdc.example.com to make sure that change propagated.
</p><p>
Once we've verified that slurpd is working, we create a cron job on
ldap.example.com to keep the credentials from expiring. The default
time limit for credential validity is ten hours, so if we define a cron
job to run every eight hours, we should be safe.
</p><p>
Last, we add kdc.example.com into our rotation of valid LDAP servers
for nss_ldap. That is, we append kdc.example.com to the list of servers
specified by the host option in /etc/ldap.conf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe4a898"></a>
Configuring the Postfix MTA</h2></div></div><p>
We'll be using the Postfix mail transport agent (MTA) v2.1.5. Postfix has
well-established support for SASL authentication as well as LDAP support
for features such as aliases. Because configuring Postfix from the ground
up is beyond the scope of this article, we deal with how to enable
Postfix to use SASL and TLS. For information on setting up Postfix,
see Resources.
</p><p>
Postfix has two main configuration files, /etc/postfix/main.cf and
/etc/postfix/master.cf. The main.cf file is primarily responsible for
how to accept incoming mail, and master.cf is primarily responsible for
defining mail delivery agents.
</p><p>
An example main.cf is included in the on-line Resources, but to
understand the directives in this file fully, you should refer to the Postfix
documentation and Web site.
</p><p>
Three main directives define how our SMTP server interacts with
other SMTP servers: smtp_sasl_auth_enable, smtp_use_tls and
smtp_tls_note_starttls. If your SMTP server will be exposed to the
Internet at large, you should set these as flexibly as possible to ensure
all other SMTP servers can talk to yours. If it's an internal-only
SMTP server, however, you can make it more secure by strengthening
these directives.
</p><p>
The more interesting part is how we specify how our users and
machines connect to our MTA to send mail. A few more directives are
of concern here: smtpd_sasl_auth_enable, smtpd_sasl_security_options,
smtpd_sasl_tls_security_options, smtpd_use_tls, smtpd_tls_cert_file,
smtpd_tls_key_file and smtpd_tls_auth_only.
</p><p>
If you'll be using IMAP for mail delivery, make sure to set the
mailbox_transport directive and the smtp and cyrus transports mechanism
in master.cf.
</p><p>
Like OpenLDAP, Postfix is kerberized, uses SASL for authentication
negotiation and can use SSL to secure the data transport. To secure
Postfix and configure it to use SASL, we need to do a few tasks in
addition to modifying main.cf. First we create an SSL certificate/key
pair and place the two parts in /etc/ssl/postfix/smtp-cert.pem
and /etc/ssl/postfix/smtp-key.pem, making sure that they're
owned by the user postfix and group mail, and that the key is
readable only by user postfix. Next, we create a host principal for
mail.example.com and save it to the normal place. We also create a
service principal, smtp/mail.example.com@CI.EXAMPLE.COM and save it
to /etc/postfix/smtp.keytab. This file should be owned by root and
have the same permissions as the smtp-key.pem file. In addition, we
create a SASL configuration file named /etc/sasl2/smtpd.conf and also
edit /etc/conf.d/saslauthd. Postfix uses the saslauthd d&aelig;mon to get
information about authentication mechanisms, and these two files tell
SASL how to check passwords, what mechanisms are supported and the
minimum security layer to use. Values for minimum_layer are equivalent to
the security strength factors (SSFs) in OpenLDAP. Finally, we tell Postfix
where its Kerberos keytab file is by creating /etc/conf.d/postfix or
by making sure the KRB5_KTNAME environment variable is set in the init
script prior to starting Postfix. Once all these tasks have been done,
we can start the saslauthd and Postfix init scripts.
</p><p>
LDAP is useful not only for identity management and authorization but
also for storing alias maps for Postfix. It's simple to use and maintain,
and it removes the need to rebuild the alias database every time there
is a change to it. The first step is to make our directory aware that
we want to store alias maps in it. We do this by adding the misc.schema
to the slapd configuration. Next, we create a branch in the directory
for the aliases. We'll use ou=aliases,o=ci,dc=example,dc=com. The last
piece is to tell Postfix to use LDAP as a source for aliases by adding
ldap:/etc/postfix/aliases.cf to the alias_maps directive in main.cf and
creating the /etc/postfix/aliases.cf file that specifies how to connect
to LDAP and where the aliases are in LDAP. We restart slapd and then
Postfix; we're now ready to add a mail alias. We create an LDIF file
called alias.ldif and add it to the directory. That's it!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd51580.0xe4ac08"></a>
Configuring the cyrus IMAP MDA</h2></div></div><p>
We'll be using the cyrus IMAP mail delivery agent (MDA) v2.2.10. Complete
configuration of the cyrus IMAP server is beyond the scope of this
document, but example working configuration files are provided. The cyrus
IMAP server is developed by the same group who developed cyrus SASL,
so SASL and single sign-on support work as expected.
</p><p>
Like Postfix, cyrus IMAP has two configuration files: /etc/imapd.conf
and /etc/cyrus.conf. We'll be dealing only with /etc/imapd.conf. Again
there are a few prerequisites: SSL certificate/key pair, host
principal and service principal. The service principal should be called
imap/mail.example.com@CI.UCHICAGO.EDU and stored in /etc/imap.keytab. To
enable SSL, we define tls_ca_path, tls_cert_file and tls_key_file options
accordingly. To use SASL, we define sasl_pwcheck_method, sasl_mech_list
and sasl_minimum_layer options. The values for these options are identical
to those set in /etc/sasl2/smtpd.conf for Postfix. Like Postfix, cyrus
IMAP needs to be told where its keytab file is. We do this by editing
/etc/conf.d/cyrus or making sure the KRB5_KTNAME environment variable
is set in the init script prior to starting the IMAP d&aelig;mon. Once all
this has been done, we should make sure saslauthd is running and then
start the imap init script.

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
We certainly have covered a whole lot in a short time, but all this
hard work has given you a secure and scalable corporate directory. We've
just implemented a system that works for tens of users and hosts at one
location all the way up to thousands spread all over the world. In my
next article, we'll tackle tying Linux and Apple OS X clients into our
system to see the fruits of our labor.
