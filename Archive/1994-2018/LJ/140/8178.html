Just using a lot of swap space doesn't necessarily mean
that you need more memory. Here's how to tell when Linux
is happy with the available memory and when it needs more.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c8580.0x18c0348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux novices often find virtual memory mysterious, but with a grasp
of the fundamental concepts, it's easy to understand. With this
knowledge, you can monitor your system's memory utilization using
vmstat and detect problems that can adversely affect system
performance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c8580.0x18c0450"></a>
How Virtual Memory Works</h2></div></div><p>
Physical memory&mdash;the actual RAM installed&mdash;is a finite resource on
any system. The Linux memory handler manages the allocation of
that limited resource by freeing portions of physical memory when
possible.
</p><p>
All processes use memory, of course, but each process doesn't need
all its allocated memory all the time.
Taking advantage of this fact, the kernel frees up
physical memory by writing some or all of a process' memory to disk
until it's needed again.
</p><p>
The kernel uses paging and swapping to perform this memory
management. Paging refers to writing portions, termed pages, of
a process' memory to disk. Swapping, strictly speaking, refers to
writing the entire process, not just part, to disk. In Linux, true
swapping is exceedingly rare, but the terms paging and swapping
often are used interchangeably.
</p><p>
When pages are written to disk, the event is called a page-out,
and when pages are returned to physical memory, the event is called
a page-in. A page fault occurs when the kernel needs a page,
finds it doesn't exist in physical memory because it has been paged-out, and re-reads it in from disk.
</p><p>
Page-ins are common, normal and are not a cause for concern. For
example, when an application first starts up, its executable image
and data are paged-in. This is normal behavior.
</p><p>
Page-outs, however, can be a sign of trouble.
When the kernel detects that memory is running low,
it attempts to free up memory by paging out.
Though this may happen briefly from time to time,
if page-outs are plentiful and constant, the kernel
can reach a point where it's actually spending
more time managing paging activity than running
the applications, and system performance suffers.
This woeful state is referred to as thrashing.
</p><p>
Using swap space is not inherently bad. Rather,
it's intense paging <span   class="emphasis"><em>activity</em></span>
that's problematic. For instance, if your most-memory-intensive application is idle, it's fine for
portions of it to be set aside when another large
job is active. Memory pages belonging to an idle
application are better set aside so the kernel can
use physical memory for disk buffering.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c8580.0x18c07c0"></a>
Using vmstat</h2></div></div><p>
vmstat, as its name suggests, reports virtual memory statistics.
It shows how much virtual memory there is, how much is free and
paging activity. Most important, you can observe page-ins and
page-outs as they happen. This is extremely useful.
</p><p>
To monitor the virtual memory activity on your system, it's best
to use vmstat with a delay. A delay is the number of seconds
between updates. If you don't supply a delay, vmstat reports
the averages since the last boot and quit. Five seconds is the
recommended delay interval.
</p><p>
To run vmstat with a five-second delay, type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
vmstat 5
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can specify a count, which indicates how many updates you
want to see before vmstat quits. If you don't specify a count, the
count defaults to infinity, but you can stop output with Ctrl-C.
</p><p>
To run vmstat with ten updates, five seconds apart, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vmstat 5 10
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's an example of a system free of paging activity:

<pre     class="programlisting">
  procs                     memory    swap        io     system cpu
r  b  w   swpd   free  buff  cache  si so   bi  bo   in    cs us sy  id
0  0  0  29232 116972  4524 244900   0  0    0   0    0     0 0   0   0
0  0  0  29232 116972  4524 244900   0  0    0   0 2560     6 0   1  99
0  0  0  29232 116972  4524 244900   0  0    0   0 2574    10 0   2  98
</pre>
</p><p>
All fields are explained in the vmstat man page,
but the most important columns for this article are
free, si and so. The free column shows the
amount of free memory, si shows page-ins and so
shows page-outs. In this example, the so column is
zero consistently, indicating there are no page-outs.
</p><p>
The abbreviations so and si are used instead of the more accurate
po and pi for historical reasons.
</p><p>
Here's an example of a system with paging activity:

<pre     class="programlisting">
  procs                      memory    swap          io     system cpu
r  b  w   swpd   free  buff cache  si  so   bi   bo   in    cs us  sy  id
. . .
1  0  0  13344   1444  1308 19692   0 168  129   42 1505   713 20  11  69
1  0  0  13856   1640  1308 18524  64 516  379  129 4341   646 24  34  42
3  0  0  13856   1084  1308 18316  56  64   14    0  320  1022 84   9   8
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the nonzero so values indicating there is not enough
physical memory and the kernel is paging out. You can use top and
ps to identify the processes that are using the most memory.
</p><p>
You also can use top to show memory and
swap statistics. Here is an example of the uppermost
portion of a typical top report:

<pre     class="programlisting">
14:23:19 up 348 days,  3:02,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
55 processes: 54 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:   0.0% user,   2.4% system,   0.0% nice,  97.6% idle
Mem:    481076K total,   367508K used,   113568K free,     4712K buffers
Swap:  1004052K total,    29852K used,   974200K free,   244396K cached
</pre>
</p><p>
For more information about top, see the top man page.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It isn't necessarily bad for your system to be
using some of its swap space. But if you discover
your system is often running low on physical memory
and paging is causing performance to suffer, add
more memory. If you can't add more memory, run
memory-intensive jobs at different times of the day,
avoid running nonessential jobs when memory demand
is high or distribute jobs across multiple systems
if possible.
