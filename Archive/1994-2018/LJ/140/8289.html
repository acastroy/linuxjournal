You don't have to move to an integrated development
environment to get luxury coding features. From variable autocompletions
all the way up to integration with ctags and make, Vim makes a C programmer's 
life easier and more productive.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf902f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Vim is an extremely powerful editor with a user
interface based on Bill Joy's almost 30-year-old vi,
but with many new features. The features that make
Vim so versatile also sometimes makes it intimidating
for beginners. This article attempts to level the
learning curve with a specific focus on C programming.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf903f8"></a>
make and the Compile-Test-Edit Cycle</h2></div></div><p>
A typical programmer's routine involves compiling
and editing programs until the testing proves
that the program correctly does the job it is supposed to do. 
Any mechanism that reduces the rigor of
this cycle obviously makes any programmer's life
easier. Vim does exactly that by integrating <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> with Vim in such a way that you 
don't have to leave the editor to compile and test the program.
Running <tt  >:make</tt> from inside of Vim does the job for
you, provided a makefile is in the current
directory. 
</p><p>
You can change the directory from inside of Vim by running
<tt  >:cd</tt>. To verify where you
are, use <tt  >:pwd</tt>. In case you are using
FreeBSD and want to invoke gmake instead of
make from the command line, all you have to do is enter 
<tt  >:set makeprg=gmake</tt>. Now say you want to give some
parameters to make. If, for instance, 
you want to give CC=gcc296:

<pre     class="programlisting">

:set makeprg=gmake\ \CC=gcc296 

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf90768"></a></h2></div></div><p>
does the job. 
</p><p>
Now comes the job of inspecting the errors, jumping
to the appropriate line number in the source file
and fixing them. If you want to display the line
numbers in the source file, <tt  >:se nu</tt> turns on this
option, and <tt  >:se nonu</tt> disables line number display.
</p><p>
Once you compile, Vim automatically takes you
to the first line that is causing the error. To
go to the next error; use <tt  >:cn</tt> to take you to the next
line number causing the error. <tt  >:cfirst</tt> and
<tt  >:clast</tt>
take you to the first error and the last error, 
respectively. One you have fixed the errors, you can compile
again. If you want to inspect the error list
again, <tt  >:clist</tt> displays it. 
Convenient, isn't it? 
</p><p>
If you want to read some other source file, say
foo.c, while fixing a particular error, simply type
<tt  >:e foo.c</tt>.
</p><p>
One shortcut provided by Vim to avoid typing too much to switch back to the previous file is to type 
<tt  >:e #</tt> 
instead of typing the full path of the file. 
If you want to see all of the files you have opened in Vim at any point
in time, you can use
<tt  >:ls</tt>
or
<tt  >:buffers</tt>.
</p><p>
If you have a situation in which you have opened too many files and
you want to close some of them, you can issue <tt  >:ls</tt>. It should display
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
2 #    "newcachain.c"                 line 5
3 %a   "cachain.c"                    line 1
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to close newcachain.c, <tt  >:bd 2</tt> or
<tt  >:bd newcachain.c</tt> does the
job.
</p><p>
While browsing C code, you may have situations in which you want to
skip multiple functions fast. You can use the ]] key combination for
that while in command mode. If you want to browse backward in the
file, [[ can be used.
</p><p>
You also can use marks to bookmark certain cursor positions. You
can use any lowercase alphabet character as a mark. For instance, say you
want to mark line number 256 of the source and call it b. Simply go to
that line, <tt  >:256</tt>, and type <tt  >mb</tt>
in command mode. Vim never echos what you type in command mode but
silently executes the commands for you.
</p><p>
If you want to go to the previous position, <tt  >''</tt>
(two single-quotation
marks) takes you there. 
Typing <tt  >'a</tt> takes you to mark a and so on. 
</p><p>
Especially when editing Makefiles, you may want to figure out which of the white spaces are tabs. You can type 
<tt  >:se list</tt>, 
and whatever is displayed as <tt  >^I</tt> in blue are tabs. Another way to do that
is to use <tt  >/\t</tt>. This highlights the tabs in yellow.
</p><p>
Global searches and replaces are common tasks for programmers, and Vim provides good support for both. 
Simply type <tt  >/</tt> in command mode, and you are taken
to the searched keyword. If you prefer incremental searches, 
&agrave; l&aacute; emacs, you can specify 
<tt  >:se incsearch</tt>
before you search. When you want to disable it, type
<tt  >:se nois</tt>.
</p><p>
Search and replace is a powerful tool in Vim. You
can execute it only on a region that you selected
using the v command, only between certain line
numbers or only in rectangular regions selected by using
Ctrl-V command.
</p><p>
Once you select your region or line number ranges, for example using
<tt  >:24,56</tt>
to select lines 24&ndash;56 (both inclusive), or just select your region and
type : <tt  >:&lt;','&gt;</tt>
appears. Now type <tt  >s/foo/bar</tt> to replace all occurrences of the string foo with bar.
</p><p>
But, this command replaces only one instance per line. If you want to do
this for multiple occurrences per line, type 
<tt  >s/foo/bar/g</tt>. If you want to replace only some
occurrences, you can use
the &ldquo;confirm&rdquo; option with <tt  >s/foo/bag/gc</tt>.
</p><p>
Sometimes the string contains characters that appear as a substring
of other keywords. For instance, say you want to replace the variable
&ldquo;in&rdquo;
and not the &ldquo;in&rdquo; in inta. To search for whole words, type
<tt  >/\&lt;in\&gt;/</tt>.
</p><p>
Most commonly, you will want to do a global replace, which
is every instance in a given file. You can do that by
using either <tt  >:1,$s/foo/bar/g</tt> or
<tt  >:%s/foo/bar/g</tt>. If you then want to replace
this in all the files you have open, you can enter <tt  >:bufdo
%s/foo/bar/g</tt>. 
</p><p>
Another way of searching is by going to the keyword and typing *
in command mode. The keyboard now will be highlighted wherever it occurs in the
file. Searching backward is simple too; type ? instead of / while searching.
</p><p>
Once the searching is over, Vim remembers it,
so the next time you search for the same keyword,
you have to type only / or ?, instead of typing the
whole text.
</p><p>
One side effect of searching is that it stays highlighted. This can be a distraction while editing programs. Turn highlighting off by typing
<tt  >:se nohlsearch</tt>, <tt  >:nohlsearch</tt> 
or <tt  >:nohl</tt>
</p><p>
You always can use the Tab key to complete Vim commands you give with a
colon. For instance, you can type
<tt  >:nohl</tt>&lt;Tab&gt;, and Vim completes it for you. This
is applicable generically, and you can press Tab to cycle through Vim's
commands until Vim finds a unique match.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf885a0"></a>
Vim with Exuberant ctags</h2></div></div><p>
Exuberant ctags (see the on-line Resources) is an external program
that can generate tags for Vim to navigate source
code. If all of your source code is contained in only
one directory, simply go to the directory in the
shell and enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ctags .
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates a tags file called tags. Vim reads
this file for jumping to functions, enums, #defines
and other C constructs.
</p><p>
If the source code is distributed across
several directories, ctags has to
generate tags for all of them relative to a certain
directory. To do this, go to the root directory of the
source code and execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ctags -R .
</pre>
</p><p>
Check whether the tags file has been generated. You
also can open and read the tags file in Vim.
</p><p>
Now, let us move on to navigating the source code using
tags. Navigating the source code using ctags is one of
the most fascinating tools that a programmer has. You
can read the code so nicely and quickly that you
wonder how it would have been without ctags.
</p><p>
Once the tags file has been generated, open the file in Vim as normal, except that if the file is deep inside, open it from the
root directory. For instance, your source code is organized like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
  common
    |
    ----&gt; gui --&gt; wxpython
    |       |
    |       ------&gt;Tk
    |
    ----&gt; backend --&gt; networking

  include

  user
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to edit tcp.c under
the common/backend/networking directory, you should open
it like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ vim common/backend/networking/tcp.c
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf88a70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
instead of like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd common/backend/networking
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf88bd0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ vim tcp.c
</pre>
</p><p>
The tags file is situated in the directory above common, and Vim
automatically knows the location of the tags file this way. 
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can open the file using the second
method mentioned above and execute this from inside
of Vim:

<pre     class="programlisting">

:se tags=../../../tags

</pre>
</p><p>
The first method is easier for navigation. Once you open
the file, you can jump from one function definition to
another easily by using the key combination Ctrl-].
</p><p>
If you want to go to the definition of anything, be
it a function, macro or anything else, simply press 
Ctrl-] when the cursor is positioned on it. Thus, 
from invocation, we can move to the definition. It
takes you there no matter which file contains
it. Assuming that we call drawscreen() from tcp.c,
it automatically takes you there, even if the file
is contained under common/gui.
</p><p>
If you want to go back to what you were reading,
press Ctrl-T, and you return to where you left. You
can jump to another invocation from there by pressing 
Ctrl-] again. You can continue this process ad
infinitum, and you can keep coming back by pressing 
Ctrl-T.
</p><p>
Another way to find a function definition if you know only a part of the
name is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:ta /function
</pre>
</p><p>
This command takes you to the first match if there are multiple matches. You
can go to the next match with <tt  >:tn</tt>.
</p><p>
If there are multiple definitions and you want to choose among them,
you can press G Ctrl-] or type <tt  >:tselect
&lt;tagname&gt;</tt>. This way you can modify
the source code by navigating with tags without even knowing which file
contains what. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf89150"></a>
Vim with cscope</h2></div></div><p>
Cscope is another powerful source code navigation tool with which we can
perform a variety of searches. Here is a sample output of the Cscope
menu:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Find this C symbol:
Find this global definition:
Find functions called by this function:
Find functions calling this function:
Find this text string:
Change this text string:
Find this egrep pattern:
Find this file:
Find files #including this file:
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, Vim has integrated Cscope into its repertoire, making it
convenient for programmers to use the same features in Cscope from
the cool comfort of Vim. All you have to do is establish a Cscope
connection by issuing <tt  >:cs add cscope.out</tt>.
</p><p>
As we discussed before with ctags, Cscope generates an index called
cscope.out that can be generated by using the shell command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cscope -Rbq 
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates the file cscope.out. It is to be executed from the
source code root directory &agrave; l&aacute; Ctags. You then open the file as
before, relative to the source code root directory, and make a Cscope
connection with the command
<tt  >:cs add cscope.out</tt>. You can verify existing Cscope connections by
typing <tt  >:cs show</tt>.
</p><p>.
What you can search for from inside of Vim can be seen using
<tt  >:cs&lt;CR&gt;</tt>.
For instance, to go to a particular file, or a header of a source
file, simply type <tt  >:cs f f stdio.h</tt> for opening
stdio.h or <tt  >:cs f f
foo.c</tt>.


</p><p>
For searching for functions called by a function foo.c, type
<tt  >:cs f d foo.c</tt>. This lists out the functions
called by foo.c. For functions calling foo.c, type <tt  >:cs f
c foo.c</tt>. 
</p><p>
To search for an egrep pattern, type
<tt  >:cs f e varName</tt> 
and so on. For a list of the available options, type 
<tt  >:cs</tt>.
It displays a range of available options. 
</p><p>
Now, if you have both ctags and Cscope, you can type
<tt  >:cstag /foo</tt>
to search for a function or enum or whatever that contains foo.

Vim and Syntax Highlighting</h2></div></div><p>
If there is one feature in Vim for which it wins
hands-down compared to any other editor or IDE,
it is full-featured syntax highlighting. The
colors available in Vim make it a veritable delight
to work with source code. It not only makes your life
colorful, it also makes it easy to spot errors ahead of
compilation. Common errors such as a mismatched ),}
or ] in the code are easy to see. It also 
reminds you if you have left a string hanging without
the closing " or '. It tells you the comment doesn't
end with */, or that you are nesting comments. Syntax highlighting 
is smart when it comes to C syntax.
</p><p>
Typically, you wouldn't have to do anything to enable Vim's syntax
highlighting; <tt  >:sy on</tt>
does the job in case your distribution doesn't enable it by default. As with other commands, you can add this to your ~/.vimrc file.
</p><p>
If colors still don't show up, something is wrong with your terminal. Fix it first.
<tt  >:se filetype on</tt> is another thing you can try in addition to 
<tt  >:sy enable</tt>.
</p><p>
Let us assume that you have colors displayed
correctly. Say you don't like a certain color, or
because blue is not visible in dark backgrounds, you can't read C comments.
To solve the second problem, a simple
<tt  >:se background=dark</tt>
does the job. If you want to disable syntax highlighting for C comments, type
<tt  >:highlight clear comment</tt>.
</p><p>
To change colors, first use the 
<tt  >:syntax</tt>
command to display all the syntax items for the given buffer. Then, 
identify the syntax group you want to change. If
you want strings displayed in a bright white
color, which is easy to read against a black background, simply enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:highlight String ctermfg=white
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf89e60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or, for gvim users, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:highlight String guifg=white
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can change the syntax color of any
group. Typical syntax groups are Statement, Label,
Conditional, Repeat, Todo and Special. You
can change the attributes of highlighting as well, such as
underline and bold. For instance, if you want
to display NOTE, FIXME, TODO and XXX with underlining,
you can use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:highlight Todo cterm=underline
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf8a070"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or you can both add bold and change the color:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:highlight Repeat ctermfg=yellow cterm=bold 
</pre>
</p><p>
You can create your own set of highlight commands
and save it in your ~/.vimrc file so that every time
you edit your source code, your favorite colors
are displayed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf8a228"></a>
Vim and Variable Name Completion</h2></div></div><p>
In addition, Vim has a feature for variable name completion. While
typing, simply press Ctrl-N or Ctrl-P in insert
mode. Remember, this works only in insert mode. All
other commands mentioned above work in command
mode. You can cycle through possible completions by
pressing Ctrl-N again.
</p><p>
This helps us avoid errors while typing, because
structure members and function names often can be
misspelled. This works best when Vim can use tags,
so make sure a ctags file is in place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf8a388"></a>
Vim and Source Code Formatting</h2></div></div><p>
Vim understands C well enough to be able to indent code automatically. 
The default indentation style uses tabs, which may not be appropriate for some people. 
In order to remove tabs completely from the source, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
:set expandtab
:retab
</pre>
</p><p>
which converts all tabs into spaces in such a way
that the indentation is preserved. While typing C
text, Vim automatically indents for you. This
helps you figure out where you have your matching
brace. You can match braces, ), ] and } with the %
command in command mode. Simply take the cursor
to a brace and press %, which takes you to the
corresponding closing or opening brace. This works
for comments as well as for #if, #ifdef and #endif.
</p><p>
After finishing typing the program, if you want to indent the whole file
at one go, type <tt  >gg=G</tt> in command mode. You then can 
remove tabs if you want by the above-mentioned method.
<tt  >gq</tt> is the command sequence for indenting comments. 
You can select a region and indent it too with the = operator. 
</p><p>
If Vim's default tab indentation is painful to use, you can disable
it by setting <tt  >:se nocindent</tt>. Other indentation
options are available. You can indent
code between two braces and between certain line
numbers. You can learn more by typing <tt  >:help
indent.txt</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe98580.0xf8a750"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Vim comes with rich help documentation. Type <tt  >:help</tt>
from inside of Vim to browse it. To go to a particular topic,
press Ctrl-] on the turquoise-colored text. Vim's help documentation
uses the navigation mechanism we saw using tags.
