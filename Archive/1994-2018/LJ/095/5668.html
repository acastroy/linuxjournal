Marti)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda0580.0xe99268"></a>Savannah and Free Software Development</h2></div></div><p>What began as a simple move to reduce the workload of the GNU
CVS maintainers has turned into an ambitious project to create a
complete development hosting facility. In October 2001, the GNU
Project announced a plan to rewrite completely the SourceForge
software. This rewrite will address several key technical and
practical issues.</p><p>SourceForge is an integrated collaborative development
environment. It presents a web interface as a portal to CVS, FTP
and e-mail services. The original SourceForge server,
<a href="http://SourceForge.net" target="_self">SourceForge.net</a>,
currently hosts more than 30,000 projects and 300,000 users.</p><p>The GNU Project has been running a modified version of the
SourceForge software at
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org" target="_self">savannah.gnu.org</a> since
late in the year 2000. Savannah was set up by GNU volunteers to
automate and ease the process of GNU project management. Developers
of the GNU Project want a service specifically for free software
projects, and one independent from the VA Software
Corporation.</p><p>Concern has been expressed over the centralized nature of the
current SourceForge system. Where do the hosted projects go when
and if VA Software loses the capital to support
<a href="http://SourceForge.net" target="_self">SourceForge.net</a>? Where
do those 30,000+ projects go if some SSSCA-like bill becomes a
reality?</p><p>The development team has come up with an obvious answer:
decentralization. Projects will be hosted on various sites across a
network. All projects will be browseable from any node of the
network.</p><p>Each machine running the new Savannah system will host any
number of read/write and read-only projects. A read/write project
will exist locally on that machine. Read-only projects are mirrors
of a project hosted elsewhere. In case one of the host machines
goes down, locally hosted developers will be able to move to one of
the mirrors of their project and set that to be the read/write
server for the project. Project definitions are exchanged between
distinct servers via an XML-based format. The Savannah service is
fault-tolerant. It allows for machines going out of service without
loss of data.</p><p>The Savannah developers are basing all of the content of the
new system on templates. Sections of pages can be pulled from GNU
gettext files, based on the language of the reader.
<span   class="bold"><b>gettext</b></span> is a package for
developers, translators and users for creating multilingual
applications. This provides for internationalization, a feature
sorely lacking in the current SourceForge system.</p><p>The developers of the new system have determined to create a
system where there is a clearly defined upgrade path between
versions of the software. The software will be packaged using
Debian's .deb packages, and upgrades will be automated through use
of the package system.</p><p>The system is based on the GNU phpGroupWare code base.
phpGroupWare implements templates needed for internationalization,
authentication, database access, an XML-RPC interface and session
management. The Savannah team is working closely with the
phpGroupWare team to exchange improvements.</p><p>Bradley Kuhn, vice president of the Free Software Foundation,
wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A collaborative site providing a unified
interface for project management is key for free software
development. To truly help the cause of software freedom, such
sites must be implemented completely with free software. Savannah
does this for the GNU Project and will soon do the same for all
GPL-compatible free software projects.</p></blockquote></div><p>Savannah will provide important services to free software
developers. It will provide the services of
<a href="http://SourceForge.net" target="_self">SourceForge.net</a> on a
world-spanning network of servers that each speak the individual
developer's language. Savannah will have fault tolerance and data
recovery. Best of all, the only support that the system needs is
for volunteers to provide hosting services and support to their
ability. Look for more information on Savannah at

massive volunteer nonprofit projects that share the spirit of
community media. It's a radical alternative movement creating
successful mainstream software. In fact, it's the same movement
that produced the software that the internet revolution depends on.
Now the movement has produced a cutting-edge technology that suits
the CBAA's needs far better than the commercial competition. The
technology is Linux. A Linux server is one the CBAA could be proud
of.</p><p>&mdash;From the Community Broadcasting Association of

customers that already serve a lot of Linux out of zSeries
mainframes.</p><p>Now IBM is moving downscale toward smaller businesses, noting
IDC's estimate that small businesses represent 48% of all Linux
