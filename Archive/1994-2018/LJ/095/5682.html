    Doc muses on the curiosity of kids and the power of Linux as
    a building material.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12aa580.0x13a24a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>It was almost three years ago that Dr.
Sugara Mitra, head of NIIT's Centre for Research on Cognitive
Systems, began quietly to put internet kiosks where kids hang out
in the poorest parts of New Delhi. The effort, titled &ldquo;Hole in the
Wall&rdquo;, was an experiment in &ldquo;minimally invasive education&rdquo;, a
concept that offers this affront to the base assumptions of formal
education: &ldquo;that in the absence of any directed input, any
learning environment that provides an adequate level of curiosity
can cause learning.&rdquo;
</p><p>Here is what happened, the Hole in the Wall web site
(<a href="http://www.niitholeinthewall.com" target="_self">www.niitholeinthewall.com</a>)
reports:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The objective of this experiment was to check if
people would be interested in using an unmanned internet-based
kiosk out in the open, without any instructions. It also aimed at
ascertaining if an unmanned kiosk can be operational without any
supervision in an outdoor location.
</p><p>The boundary wall of the NIIT office where the computer was
placed is adjacent to a slum, which has a lot of children from 0-18
years of age. Some of these children do not go to school, and a few
who do, go to government schools that lack resources, good teachers
and student motivation. These children are not particularly
familiar with the English language.</p><p>The results of the experiment have been quite exciting.
Within three months of opening up of the internet kiosk, it was
found that the children, mostly from the slum, had achieved a
certain level of computer skills without any planned instructional
intervention. They were able to browse the Internet, download
songs, go to cartoon sites and work on MS Paint. They even invented
their own vocabulary to define terms on the computer, for example,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sui</em></span> (needle) for the cursor, &ldquo;channels&rdquo; for
web sites and <span   class="emphasis"><em>damru</em></span> (Shiva's drum) for the
hourglass (busy) symbol. By the fourth month, the children were
able to discover and accomplish tasks like creating folders,
cutting and pasting, creating shortcuts, moving/resizing windows
and using MS Word to create short messages in the absence of
keyboard. When the issue of whether the kiosk should be removed
from the boundary wall arose, the children strongly opposed the
idea. The parents also felt that the computer was good for their
children. The kiosk continues to be operational today with
approximately 80 children using it per day.</p></blockquote></div><p>Over the next two and a half years, Dr. Mitra and his team
mounted internet-connected PCs in 29 different walls in four
different Indian cities. The experiment continues, but at this
point a number of additional findings are clear:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>On the whole, users do not damage or abuse the
equipment.</p></li><li><p>Learning is social. Children learn faster in groups
because members are eager to share what they know and learn.</p></li><li><p>Shy children are not left out. Girls especially
assume organizing roles, throwing screen hogs off the computer to
let quieter children have a turn. Kids even organize classes for
each other.</p></li><li><p>Adults don't participate, although they believe the
kiosks are good things. Kids are the users.</p></li><li><p>Users figure out how to improve the computers. One
found a way to improve the quality of the music files that played
on the systems' little speakers.</p></li></ol></div>

Perhaps the most telling discovery was that Dr. Mitra's subjects do
not like being subjects. One of the messages he received from one
group said in Hindi, &ldquo;We have found and closed the thing you watch
us with.&rdquo; He was gratified: &ldquo;It made me so happy! I don't think
[as a teacher] you can have a greater reward than to have a child
beat you at your own game.&rdquo;
</p><p>Now let's pause to raise the obvious irony. These kiosks ran
(and run) various forms of Microsoft Windows OSes, which cost
money. The hands-down winner OS for the self-teaching crowd is
Linux, which is free. The only OS with a legitimate claim to
all-world relevance is Linux. You can recite the rest of the
virtues list. But rather than do that, let's visit one quote from
another corner of the world:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We believe LINUX can play a very important role
in Latin American and Caribbean modernisation, constructing
networks to permit a great number of universities, colleges,
schools and educational centers to connect to the Internet in order
to use this fabulous tool to improve their scientific and cultural
levels. In a few words, LINUX is the tool that permits reducing the
&ldquo;technological gap&rdquo; between the countries. LINUX permits access
to &ldquo;the most advanced informatics&rdquo; implemented according to the
reduced economic capacities in our region. LINUX is a new way to
make informatics, where the most important thing is &ldquo;the technical
quality and personal solidarity&rdquo;.</p></blockquote></div><p>That one comes from the United Nations by way of
<a href="http://ctrlaltesc.org" target="_self">ctrlaltesc.org</a>. In that
same region, our own Phil Hughes (<i  >Linux Journal</i>'s founder and publisher) has been working on
Linux adoption in Costa Rica.
</p><p>So why not do more here? Since NIIT has taken the lead on
this altruistic venture, how about working with that company to get
some Linux boxes out there on the streets? I see that NIIT has a
Linux training partnership with Red Hat. Let's get a hardware
company to step up and take it to the next stage.</p><p>The only impediments to progress here are conceptual. In the
same way it's hard for the educational establishment to admit the
transcendent power of kids' natural curiosity, it's hard for the
business establishment to admit the raw usefulness of Linux and
other free and open-source software.</p><p>Education-as-usual assumes that kids are empty vessels who
need to be sat down in a room and filled with curricular content.
Dr. Mitra's experiments prove that wrong. Software-as-usual assumes
that its business is only about selling bits in manufactured
packages. Linux proves that wrong, simply because it is being put
to use everywhere. People are making money. Commercial software
remains unharmed and contributes plenty of good on its own. It's a
big world and a big business with room enough for everybody. But it
won't include the world's untapped billions of curious souls if all
we try to do is sell them packaged bits. We have to think bigger
than that, and more practically.</p><p>Almost two years ago I observed that the software business
eventually would turn into something much more like the
construction business: concerned fundamentally with architecture,
design and building&mdash;even using much of the same vocabulary. Prefab
products like Microsoft OSes wouldn't go away but would thrive in a
much larger context where countless professionals and amateurs
simply chose the best tools and materials for the work that needed
to be done. Some of those materials would grow, as it were, on
trees. (I explained this once to a Microsoft guy, and he
immediately got it: &ldquo;You mean, Linux is trees. Endless lumber for
anything.&rdquo; Yes indeedy.)</p><p>The world needs to deploy a lot more technology if it's going
to find a way to clothe, feed, house, employ and involve everybody
in the prosperity enjoyed today by a relative few. There's plenty
of business to be had in making that happen. It's a matter of
exploiting natural materials that renew themselves and only improve
the more you exploit them. And, there isn't a naturally abundant
building material that fills that description better than
Linux&mdash;unless, of course, we're talking about the natural curiosity
of kids.</p></div></div>
