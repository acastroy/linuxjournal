    The Book of Zope covers most of what a beginning Zope
    developer will need to know.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdb6580.0xeae5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Zope, an open-source application server,
has become an increasingly popular choice for web development in
the last few years. Zope Corporation, formerly known as Digital
Creations, has gone to great lengths to prove their commitment to
the Open Source community and has encouraged Python and Zope
developers around the world to spread the Zope gospel. The fact
that Zope is written mainly in Python has given a boost to the
worldwide Python community, providing what may indeed be the
&ldquo;killer app&rdquo; that brings new people into the Python fold.
</p><p>While Zope is an extremely powerful system for creating web
applications, it also can be daunting to new users. Its paradigms
are quite different from other web development systems, in no small
part because of its heavy reliance on objects. If you are not
comfortable with classes, instances, instance variables, class
methods and instance methods, the learning curve for Zope is even
steeper than otherwise would be the case.</p><p>While the Zope documentation has improved considerably over
the last few years, and while many
<a href="http://zope.org" target="_self">zope.org</a> members have
contributed their own documentation, tips, code and tutorials,
there is still a need for solid introductory texts for learning
Zope.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of Zope</em></span> aims to fill this
niche. It was written by a number of programmers at Beehive, a web
development company with offices in Berlin and Washington, DC. The
book is an English translation of the original German version and
reads better than I expected for a translation.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of Zope</em></span> covers most of what a
beginning Zope developer will need to know. (While some of the
chapters may be useful for designers and other nontechnical people,
nonprogrammers probably will have a difficult time understanding
many of the items in it.) Initial chapters describe how to navigate
Zope's management screens, DTML (the server-side programming
language that can be used to implement functionality without having
to write Python programs) and permissions with users and
roles.</p><p>The book then begins to cover more complex ground, describing
ZClasses, SQL connectivity and Python scripts. There is even a
chapter on Zope products, introducing the notion of a product and
how to write one of your own in Python.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of Zope</em></span> covers everything that
you might expect in a book of this type and does so thoroughly. But
as I was reading it, I felt that something was missing: a sense of
perspective, helping the fledgling Zope programmer to get &ldquo;Zope
Zen&rdquo;, an intuitive sense for how Zope works. The book's text was
informative, and its numerous examples were clear, but I wish that
there had been more pauses to explain where each technology fits
into the scheme of things, rather than simply introducing
them.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of Zope</em></span> is a good complement to
on-line Zope documentation and probably will be most useful to
programmers who want more direction after experimenting with Zope
on their own. Someone who is completely new to Zope might benefit
from this book, but they may find themselves confused and
frustrated.</p><p><a href="5679s1.html" target="_self">Publisher Information/The Good/The
