    Bruno shows some causes of slow web scripts and gives
    possible solutions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f5580.0x17ed450"></a></h2></div></div><p>PHP web scripts lose performance for a
lot of reasons. The bottleneck can be in database queries, web page
access or even slow algorithms. When performance drops, the user
gets frustrated waiting for results. Less users mean less business,
and your web site becomes unpopular.
</p><p>The main reason for performance loss is bad software analysis
and engineering. Web sites often are created and launched without
thorough performance testing. Databases often are designed to
accommodate less data than they actually do. Algorithms often are
designed poorly and usually are not optimized for speed.</p><p>When you cannot redesign the entire web design so that it
runs more quickly, you must improve its performance by serving
static pages instead of interpreting PHP whenever there's a hit.
Let's look at the ways to achieve this goal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f5580.0x17ed608"></a>The Traditional Solution</h2></div></div><p>The first thing that you can do is preprocess those PHP
scripts, or script parts, that take more time to execute. You can
do it with the help of a PHP shell. Suppose you have a web script
called index.php, and you want to preprocess it. Assuming that the
PHP shell is called phpsh, the command line is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
phpsh -q /<span   class="emphasis"><em>some_dir</em></span>/index.php &gt; /<span   class="emphasis"><em>some_dir</em></span>/index.html
</pre><p>The file index.html is now plain HTML and doesn't need any
PHP processing. You can serve it right away to the web client. But
what if the PHP script results change over time? You'd have to
preprocess the script every time the results are different. The
solution is to preprocess the PHP script periodically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f5580.0x17ed870"></a>Periodic Preprocessing</h2></div></div><p>In Linux, the easiest way to execute a given process
periodically is called crontab. The following crontab entry
illustrates a preprocessing that would execute every 15
minutes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*/15 * * * * root phpsh -q /<span   class="emphasis"><em>some_dir</em></span>/index.php
&gt; /<span   class="emphasis"><em>some_dir</em></span>/index.html
</pre><p>However, the chosen timing might not be enough to keep the
information updated. Furthermore, some scripts are not accessed
over long periods of time, while others are constantly accessed,
making the use of this technique pointless. In this case, a
script-based mechanism is needed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f5580.0x17edad8"></a>Just-in-Time Preprocessing</h2></div></div><p>This technique preprocesses scripts periodically, but only if
they are accessed. It works much like a web proxy caching system. I
will show two ways of implementing this functionality: output
buffering and after-time processing.</p><p>Output buffering checks the cache file date and time and only
processes the script if needed. The processing is done by buffering
the output and saving it in the cache file before it is sent to the
client.</p><p>In PHP you do this with the help of the ob_start() function.
This function will turn output buffering on and send it to a
callback function. There is another function to send the buffer
back to the browser: ob_end_flush(). Let's take a look at an
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
// include header file
include("header.php");
?&gt;
&lt;?php
// sleep for 10 seconds
sleep(10);
?&gt;
</pre><p>Test:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
// include footer file
include("footer.php");
?&gt;
</pre>


Inside header.php, you'll find all the cache processing. It begins
by checking whether the script needs caching by calling the
needscache() function. This function can check the need for cache
based on a time out or based on anything you like. For the purpose
of this article, the checking is based on cache time out.
</p><p>If the script needs caching, the ob cycle is started, and the
script output is written into the cache file. If it doesn't need
caching, the script output is read from the cache file and sent to
the client's browser (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="5661l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The script output is read
from the cache file and sent to the client's
browser.</a></p><p>The footer.php script simply closes the ob processing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
ob_end_flush();
?&gt;
</pre><p>You can test this technique by calling the script many times
before the cache times out. You'll notice that in the first call
you'll have to wait ten seconds (this is because the script sleeps
for ten seconds, for testing purposes), and in the following calls
the output is immediate.
</p><p>However, when the cache times out, you'll have to wait for
the script to finish processing. Let's see how you can prevent this
and give the user the illusion that the script is always
fast.</p><p>After-view processing also checks the cache file date and
time, but the processing is done after the file is served, solving
the cache time out processing burden. This is done by caching the
file after the script ends execution.</p><p>In PHP, you can do this by associating an arbitrary function
with the script termination event through the
register_shutdown_function(). The only file you'll have to change
is header.php (see Listing 2).</p><p><a href="5661l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Associating an Arbitrary
Function with the Script Termination Event</a></p><p>I simply added the doaftercache() function that is called
only after the script finishes. It then calls the script like a
normal browser does and caches it. The only time you'll have to
wait is when the script has never been cached before. Test it and
you'll get the feeling that the script is very fast.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16f5580.0x17ee1b8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This article shows you how PHP cache mechanisms work and
provides a do-it-yourself solution. If you test the examples and
like them, please feel free to implement your own solutions.
However, there other ways to improve performance like function
caching, or PHP script precompilation. Some off-the-shelf solutions
can offer you these functionalities. You should always look for the
best solution for your own needs and do your own testing.</p></div></div>
