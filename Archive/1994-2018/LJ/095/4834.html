    Thomas demonstrates the power and flexibility of Ruby.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b74558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ruby is a full-fledged, modern, pure,
object-oriented programming language. Its syntax is terse and
consistent, making Ruby both easy to read and learn, and it's
flexible and expressive as well. If you're coming from a background
in an API-bloated language, you will be surprised by Ruby's small
but powerful core API. That Ruby is tightly integrated with the
underlying operating system, and that it is ridiculously simple to
extend, makes it both a powerful and versatile programming
language.
</p><p>Bold assertions? Let's uncover the truths behind these
claims. For demonstration, I have included a simple Ruby script
that purges a temp directory of files older than a given number of
days. The application lets me demonstrate both basic Ruby syntax
and some of the language's more important features. The entire
script is included in Listing 1 [available at
<a href="../listings/095/4834.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue95/4834.tgz</a>].
It is invoked by</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./purge.rb [tmp_dir] [max_file_age_in_days]
</pre><p>where age determines how old a file needs to be before it is
purged from the temp directory. You can add a call to this script
in your crontab.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b747c0"></a>Ruby Basics</h2></div></div><p>Ruby, an object-oriented language, offers encapsulation of
data and methods within objects, allows inheritance from one class
to another and supports polymorphism. Everything, including
primitive data types like strings and integers, is represented as
an object. Even constants and classes are represented as objects.
This makes Ruby a pure object-oriented language. The only exception
here is the control structure, a handful of expressions such as
for, if, while, etc. These are not objects.</p><p>As shown in Listing 2 [available at
<a href="../listings/095/4834.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue95/4834.tgz</a>],
the delete_older method contains the top-level program logic:
traverse a given directory to check for files to delete.</p><p>To those used to typed languages like Java or C++, the method
parameters' missing type declarations may seem strange. But Ruby is
dynamically typed. That is, a variable has no type, but the object
it holds a reference to does, hence the lack of types in the
declaration. Dynamic typing favors object composition over class
inheritance. There is no controlling the type of objects passed as
parameters in method calls, alleviating the need to worry about
complex inheritance hierarchies, as we no longer depend on
polymorphism to pass objects into methods. This leads to simpler,
more reusable code.</p><p>Ruby's method declaration should look familiar to Python
programmers. The two languages declare methods in practically the
same way, including the use of optional parameters. An optional
parameter can be left out when calling a method. Leaving out the
parameter is the same as invoking the method with the optional
parameter's default value.</p><p>Ruby's method declaration also lacks a return value. Since
the language is dynamically typed, there is no need to declare a
return type. Unless a return object is explicitly specified with
the return statement, the last expression evaluated will be
returned, as in Lisp.</p><p>A method is invoked by sending the target object a message.
This is the Smalltalk way. The target.message(parameterlist)
message-passing notation should be familiar to all object-oriented
programmers. Sending an object a message invokes the corresponding
method on the target object. All inter-object communication is
handled by message passing.</p><p>Ruby operates with the notion of two kinds of methods: class
methods and what is simply called methods, or instance methods.
Instance methods are invoked on instantiated classes, more commonly
known as objects. Class methods are called on uninstantiated
classes and are like static methods in Java and C++. As a class
method is called on an uninstantiated class, it may be considered a
library method. It does not operate on the object's member
variables.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b74b30"></a>Containers</h2></div></div><p>Consider the following code the script is invoked with, which
processes the command-line parameters:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
path = ARGV.shift or raise "Missing path to delete"
age  = ARGV.shift or raise "Missing age in days"
</pre><p>ARGV is an array object containing the command-line options
from the invocation of the script. Calling &ldquo;shift&rdquo; returns and
removes array's first element. Ruby has an advanced array class.
The array is dynamic; it resizes itself. It is an object, so you
need not worry about memory issues and walking off its end either.
Methods allowing you to process the array by index, by element and
as if it were a stack, a set or a queue, are also included with the
class. Arrays may be reversed and they may be sorted. For table
lookups, use the Hash class.
</p><p>The following line from Listing 1 shows how elegant Ruby's
array is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Dir.entries(full_name) - ['.', '..']).empty?

</pre><p><b  >Dir.entries(full_name)</b> returns an array
containing all files in the directory. The array <b  >['.',
'..']</b> is then subtracted from the directory listing by
using with the <b  >-</b> operator. We can then see if
the directory is empty by calling isEmpty? on the directory
listing. If the array is empty, i.e., isEmpty? returns true, no
other files are left in the directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b74ef8"></a>Error Handling</h2></div></div><p>Once the invocation parameters have been processed, it is
time to call delete_older:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
delete_older(path, age_in_seconds)
rescue puts "Error: #$!"
</pre><p>Errors may occur during execution. If the script is invoked
with the path to a nonexistent directory, for instance, an error
will occur the first time Ruby invokes a method on the Dir class.
The code above not only invokes delete_older, it also handles
possible errors that occur during execution. The key here is the
rescue expression. When an error occurs, the Ruby interpreter
packages the error in an exception object. This object propagates
back up the call stack until it reaches some code that explicitly
declares it knows how to handle this particular type of exception.
Exceptions that are never caught propagate through the call stack,
ending up with an abnormal program termination; the stack trace is
printed to stderr. This is opposed to returning error codes like
shell scripts and C do, leading to less-nested statements, less
spaghetti logic and simply better error handling.
</p><p>Including an ensure statement in connection with the rescue
expression ensures that a code block is run no matter what else
happens. Combine this with the possibility of writing your own
exceptions, making your own code throw exceptions (with the raise
expression as shown in the program listing in Containers), and the
ability to actually recover from an exception by running some code
and retrying the code that caused the failure, and you have one of
the neatest error-handling mechanisms I've ever used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b75108"></a>Advanced Features</h2></div></div><p>Let's return to delete_older to look at some of Ruby's more
advanced features (see Listing 2 [available at
<a href="../listings/095/4834.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue95/4834.tgz</a>]).
Line two sees &ldquo;foreach&rdquo; being invoked on the Dir class; foreach
is an implementation of the iterator design pattern. If you are
doing object-oriented programming, but have not read the Gang of
Four's groundbreaking book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Design Patterns</em></span>,
you'd better run out and buy a copy. Iterator is not the only
pattern implemented in core Ruby. Singleton, publisher/subscriber,
visitor and delegation patterns also are implemented. Other
patterns also can be implemented simply if required, but the listed
patterns are shipped with Ruby.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>foreach</b></span> iterates over the
files in a directory. Following the call to Dir's foreach is a
block of code with a start and end very much resembling that of a
regular Java or C++ code block. The code contained within the curly
braces is called a block, which is like a method within a method. A
block is never executed at the time it is encountered. Whenever the
foreach method has read a single file from the directory, it yields
control to the block. The code within the block is executed, and
control returns to foreach, which reads a new file from the
directory repeating the procedure over again until no more files
are left to iterate over.</p><p>Instead of having to write helper classes to make iterators
work, as you have to in Java or C++, Ruby includes the yield
expression that makes it possible to implement iterators as
methods. This is a prime example of the language's expressiveness
and flexibility. Instead of writing the scaffolding to make it
happen, Ruby lets you concentrate on doing the job.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, a method is invoked by sending a
message to the target object on the target.message form. Only
methods local to the class may be called without specifying a
target. My script calls &ldquo;puts&rdquo;, which is a method belonging to
the kernel, without specifying any target. How does the interpreter
know which method I'm calling when puts is not local to the object
and no target is specified?</p><p>It is the magic of mix-ins. Mix-ins basically allow you to
mix methods implemented elsewhere into a class without the use of
inheritance (for more on mix-ins, please refer to the article
&ldquo;Using Mix-ins with Python&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
April 2001). Mix-ins aren't a new idea, nor is Ruby the only
language to support it. But it is most definitely one of the
features that gives Ruby that nice and clean syntax.</p><p>I could never hope to deal with all of Ruby's features in
this article. Instead I'll refer you to David Thomas and Andrew
Hunt's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Ruby</em></span> for more details
on issues like modules, aliasing, namespaces, reflection, dynamical
method calls, system hooks, program distribution and networking. It
is worth mentioning that Ruby also supports regular expressions
that are just as good as Perl's and supports CGI, in addition to
having its own Apache module, mod_ruby.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b75580"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Is Ruby yet another scripting language? No, it is not. It is
something more, something new and exciting coming out of the
Japanese open-source scene. Ruby is the programmer's best friend.
While Ruby is presented as a scripting language, it has proven
equally suited for large projects. It includes some exciting
features that other alternative languages are only beginning to
implement. Ruby is therefore well worth checking out.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7c580.0x2b75688"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>A special thanks goes out to my technical reviewers: Armin
