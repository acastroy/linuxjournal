    Marcel introduces some easy ways to organize and outline
    your thoughts for your next screenplay.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2442580.0x253a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, what are you doing? Ah, I see your creative juices
are flowing, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Dragons, spaceships,
world-spanning Linux systems...that is a marvelous story. And, I
see that you have included the restaurant as part of the setting.
This is wonderful! But why this flurry of cranial activity,
Fran&ccedil;ois?
</p><p>What is this? Ah, the March 2002 <i  >Linux Journal</i> theme is web scripting and you are writing a
script for an upcoming webcast. You want to write scripts for the
Web? Why limit yourself there? Why not write for television, radio
or the stage? With the right tools and your Linux system, you are
ready for anything. As it turns out, it is a good thing that we are
always ready, because our guests are here.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, to the cellar.
Bring up the Australian Margaret River Chardonnay. A wonderful
wine, thoughtful and aromatic. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>!</p><p>While Fran&ccedil;ois is getting the wine, I will let you
know what was happening here, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. This
month's theme was, alas, misinterpreted by my faithful waiter. When
you came in, he was working on a screenplay for what he hopes will
be a successful webcast. Rather than discourage him, we'll
concentrate today's menu on that very topic, bringing stories to
life. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, excellent. Please pour for our
friends.</p><p>Laying out a scene and creating the perfect dramatic
presentation requires some finesse with outlines and organizing
your thoughts. That is exactly what Peter Teichman was, er,
thinking about when he wrote Think, a Gtk/GNOME application that
lets you create outlines based on a hierarchical structure. The
result is then saved as an XML document. For a peek at Peter's
Think, go to
<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~peter/think" target="_self">primates.ximian.com/~peter/think</a>
and pick up the latest source. After extracting the code, you can
then build it using the classic ./configure three-step:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf thnk-0.2.1.tar.gz
cd think-0.2.1
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>To run Think, just type <b  >think &amp;</b> at the
command prompt. Figure 1 shows Think in action.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5705f1.large.jpg"><img src="5705f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. GNOME Think
</p></div></div>

</p><p>When using this simple little thought organizer, you create
nodes and subnodes, renaming them as you go to something that makes
more sense to you than &ldquo;- empty node -&rdquo;. Each one of these nodes
can have associated text. For instance, dialogue text describes
scene two, a subnode of Act 1. Each of these nodes can be dragged
and dropped in different locations on the left-hand-side listing.
To simplify the structure, each major node can be collapsed to a
single line item.</p><p>Of course, you do not have to download a thing if you do not
want to. Odds are pretty good that you already have that fabled
editor, Emacs, loaded on your system. You don't even need to be
running a graphical desktop because Emacs will run in text mode as
well. Why not try out its outline mode? It is all very simple
really. Here is what you do.</p><p>Start up Emacs by typing <b  >emacs
<i><tt>some_filename</tt></i></b> at the command
line. If the file does not already exist, it will be created for
you. This is the basic Emacs editing mode. To use the outlining
feature, press Esc-X, followed by the words
<b  >outline-mode</b> (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5705f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Entering Emacs Outline Mode
</p></div></div><p>All you have to do is start typing. For each level (or node,
in Think-speak), type an asterisk (<b  >*</b>). For a
sublevel, type two asterisks (<b  >**</b>) and so on. You
can type whatever you want below those headings, just as you would
in any editor. To collapse a level, sublevel or tree, Emacs employs
Ctrl-C sequences. Table 1 shows some of those sequences.</p><p><a href="5705t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Emacs Control
Sequences</a></p><p>Of course, if you are running Emacs in X or graphical mode,
you can just click on the Show and Hide menu items in the menubar.
When a level is collapsed, its first line or title will appear with
the trailing ellipses (<b  >. . .</b>) and the
information that follows it will be hidden. If you look at Figure
3, you'll see me spinning the &ldquo;Mystery of the Missing Wine&rdquo; using
Emacs' outline mode.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5705f3.large.jpg"><img src="5705f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>When Christopher Tomaras Lansdowne wanted to write some
comedy sketches, he turned his hand to a little Perl and XML and
put together GScriptWriter, a Gtk tool that lets you define the
basics of a story, enter characters, then pull them from a
drop-down list as you create dialogue and action for them. This
simple program also does a nice job of exporting to HTML.</p><p>You can pick up GScriptWriter by visiting the site at
<a href="http://cs.alfred.edu/~lansdoct/linux/gscriptwriter" target="_self">cs.alfred.edu/~lansdoct/linux/gscriptwriter</a>.
Once you have the source, install it like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gscriptwriter-0.1.2.tar.gz
cd gscriptwriter-0.1.2
./gscriptwriter.pl
</pre><p>As you have already noticed, there is no compilation involved
here. Simply run the script and you'll get a nice Gtk interface
wherein you can define and work with all aspects of writing a
comedic script. Right now, Fran&ccedil;ois is hard at work on a
mystery taking place in this very restaurant.
</p><p>You can organize the flow of your script by selecting lines
and then moving them up or down in your script. Save your work,
then use the HTML export feature. You'll wind up with a nice, clean
finished product (once the mystery has been unraveled, of course).
GScriptWriter is a work-in-progress, but the Perl code means you
can modify it easily and use it as the base for your own
needs.</p><p>For some, stories are those things you read on
<a href="http://Slashdot.org" target="_self">Slashdot.org</a> that just
don't come quickly enough. To rectify this problem, point your
browser to
<a href="http://bbspot.com/toys/slashtitle/index.html" target="_self">bbspot.com/toys/slashtitle/index.html</a>,
a rather amusing site that generates pseudo-random Slashdot
stories. Pay them a visit, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and you
will understand what I mean. But we digress,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>As you can see, the word story carries a lot of different
meanings. Message boards are a collaborative effort that allow
users to work together on ideas in a central location via the World
Wide Web. A story develops with one individual posting the
beginnings of an idea. Others respond, continue the discussion, and
suddenly you either have chaos or the beginnings of the next great
drama. In the right environment, a flexible message board can be a
wonderful tool.</p><p>The next item on the menu is called Phorum. Phorum is free,
open-source software and is distributed with a simple, Apache-like
license. It requires a PHP-enabled, Apache server and one of the
supported database types. This database can be PostgreSQL, MySQL,
Sybase and others. Phorum is designed to be pretty
database-independent, and the install will do an auto-detect for
currently running database servers.</p><p>Speaking of installation, you should find this one very
simple. Start by visiting the Phorum web site at
<a href="http://phorum.org" target="_self">phorum.org</a> and grab the
latest source distribution. Start by extracting the source into
your web server's hierarchy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf phorum-3.3.1a.tar.gz
mv phorum-3.3.1a.tar.gz
/usr/local/apache/htdocs/phorum
cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/phorum
</pre><p>From here, you may want to take a moment to run the
<span   class="bold"><b>secure</b></span> script to define locations
and permissions relating to Phorum's security. You will find it in
the scripts directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bash scripts/secure
</pre>


If you are running a virtual web server, this may be particularly
important. Since the layout of Phorum may be well known, you may
want to change the name of the admin directory. That is the first
question you will be asked. I would suggest that you also answer
yes to the question regarding protecting this directory with an
.htaccess file. Finally, the Phorum install will ask you what user
name your Apache server runs as. In my case, it was www.
</p><p>The remainder of the installation is done on-line. You do
this by pointing your browser to the admin directory. If you
changed it when you ran the secure script, you'll want to use that
pathname:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourwebserver</em></span>/phorum/admin
</pre><p>Phorum automatically will try to detect your installed
database. If you have multiple database packages (as I did), you
will need to choose one at this time. For my install, I chose
PostgreSQL. After clicking on Submit, I was then asked for my
database server name (localhost), the database name, and a user
name and password. Before you go ahead and fill in all those
fields, let me give you a word of warning. That database user will
have to be one that actually exists, unless your database
installation requires no username and password (which wouldn't be a
good thing). In the PostgreSQL world, adding a user looks like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
createuser user_name
</pre>


That user needs to be able to create and update databases. Then,
you'll need to create an empty database. I called mine (perhaps
unimaginatively) phorum. We do not have time to cover all the
databases, but if you should happen to be running PostgreSQL, make
sure that the &ldquo;postmaster&rdquo; is running with the -i flag to allow
for TCP and web connections to the database:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/postmaster -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -i
</pre>


Meanwhile, back at our browser installation, I fill in the
remainder of my fields, click Submit, and then I am presented with
a nice message about table creation and database updates being
successful. A toast, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>! Ah, but wait.
As they say on <span   class="emphasis"><em>la t&eacute;l&eacute;vision</em></span>,
there is more. I need to specify an admin user name and password on
the next screen. Finally, on the last screen, a URL to your Phorum
and an e-mail address for the administrator. Click Submit one final
time and you are done.
</p><p>You then will be directed automatically to the admin login
screen. Enter the newly created Phorum admin name and password, and
it is now time to beautify your collaborative world. You can change
the color scheme as well as define the number of messages per page,
whether your collaborators are allowed to post with attachments and
what size those attachments can be. Figure 5 shows Phorum's admin
screen.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5705f5.large.jpg"><img src="5705f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Phorum's Admin Screen
</p></div></div><p>Since discussions aren't much use without topics, you may
want to spend a few moments to seed your new Phorum with discussion
topics. The associated dialogues are simple and easy to use,
allowing you to specify who may post, whether the discussion is
moderated, as well as display options like color and layout.</p><p>You've configured things, created forums and discussion
groups, and chosen your colors. It's time to turn Phorum over to
the users. Because of its simple nature, you can easily plug it
into an existing web site by loading it as a frame, for instance.
Many of the sites that use Phorum do so in exactly this manner. You
also can have them point their browsers to the phorum hierarchy on
your web site:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>your_website_address</em></span>/phorum
</pre><p>Now users can create their own profiles, read, post and reply
to other posts. Whether they actually require a login profile will
depend on the requirements you set up when you created the
discussion areas through the Phorum admin screen. Figure 6 shows a
Phorum discussion in process.
