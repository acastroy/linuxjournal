It's just pork shoulder.</p><p>Yesterday in a company meeting we were discussing the various
types of spam we receive and creative ways of dealing with it.
Somehow the conversation degenerated to tossing around the idea of
a sculpting contest of Linux celebrities out of SPAM lunch
meat.</p><p>This got me wondering about SPAM's position on the world's
use of the term <span   class="emphasis"><em>spam</em></span> to describe unsolicited
e-mail. Like almost everything else in the computer world, the term
comes from a Monty Python sketch in which singing Vikings sing
&ldquo;SPAM, SPAM, SPAM&rdquo; with increasing volume, preventing any other
communication.</p><p>A visit to
<a href="http://www.spam.com" target="_self">www.spam.com</a> revealed a
company with enough confidence (it feeds America's soldiers and is
a delicacy in Korea after all) to have a sense of humor about
themselves. From their FAQ:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Q: A lot of people&mdash;comedians, especially&mdash;poke
fun at SPAM. Does it hurt your feelings?
</p><p>A: SPAM doesn't live in glass houses. It comes in
cans.</p></blockquote></div><p>You even can download SPAM desktop patterns and icons (Mac
and Windows only). They say they don't mind people using the term
as it doesn't harm their trademark, but prefer that when used to
describe electronic junk mail, it be spelled in lowercase, rather
than their trademark uppercase spelling.
</p><p>I'll say it hasn't hurt their trademark. Every time I hear
the term, or even see some in my mailbox, my mouth waters. I must
confess that despite my respect for pig the animal, I really love
pig the meat&mdash;and I'm not scared by meat in a can.</p><p>Growing up in the '70s with a mother always on some kind of
health kick we never had SPAM in the house, and my first experience
with it was during a camping trip with my 7th-grade friend Carl
Gerlock and his parents. Carl's dad was the kind of old man who
came home from work, drank a big glass of vodka and would pretty
much leave you alone if you didn't get between him and his
television&mdash;oh, and he insisted on putting out his campfires with
his urine. These people could put away the SPAM, and they did at
every meal&mdash;and I was glad to help them (despite the nasty
reputation, it really is mostly pork shoulder, ham and spices). I
suspect there are a lot of other closet SPAM lovers out there since
there have been 239,025,706 cans consumed since July 28,
1998.</p><p>I haven't eaten SPAM since that trip (my wife is at least as
health conscious as my mother), but someday I hope to. In any case,
I'll always retain those fond SPAM memories, and they'll always be
invoked by discussions of spam. Incidently David Bandel discusses a
nice cure for spam in this month's Focus on Software&mdash;if that's
your thing.</p><p><a href="5712s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
