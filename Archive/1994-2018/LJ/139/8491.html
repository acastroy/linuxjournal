Fran&ccedil;ois, although I am very impressed with your
initiative in documenting your experience in network security, that
document will need some changes. Of course, I have not read it yet,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, but I still know it needs some changes. Well, the title,
for starters&mdash;somehow, I don't think you can call it &ldquo;The Guide
to Net Hack&rdquo;. <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> is a game, Fran&ccedil;ois, and it has nothing to do with
network security. Well, not much, anyhow.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You have never heard of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu, mon ami!</em></span> This
is something we must resolve immediately, if not sooner. Unfortunately,
it is time to open the restaurant and our guests will be here momentarily,
but perhaps...ah, too late, they are already here! Welcome, everyone,
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of the finest in Linux fare and, of course, the most
extensive wine cellar in the Linux world. Please sit and make yourselves
comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois will fetch your wine
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois,
please head down to the wine cellar and bring back the 1999 Catena Alta
Cabernet Sauvignon from Argentina.
</p><p>
Just before you walked in, Fran&ccedil;ois made a rather humorous mistake,
telling me he was writing a network security guide about Net Hack,
not realizing that <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> is a game. For those of you who may not know,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> is one of the most popular dungeon-crawling
games of all time,
and it has been around seemingly forever. Back when I first started
playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>, it was just called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hack</em></span> (and before that, there
was a game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rogue</em></span>). If you want the juicy details, a nice,
concise history of the game is available from inside the game itself
(press the question mark during game play). Over time, the game was
transformed by a huge number of people scattered from
one side of the planet to the other. The code also was ported to many
different platforms and operating systems so you could play
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hack</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> on just about any machine imaginable.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hack</em></span> is gone, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>
lives and breathes to this day. This is a game that has captured the
imaginations of scores of Netizens and continues to be a hugely popular
game. Amazingly, <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> in its pure form is a text-only adventure game
(Figure 1), and it still often is played that way.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8491f1.large.jpg"><img src="8491f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. <span  class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> in Text-Only Mode
</p></div></div><p>
In text mode, and with scores of beautiful graphical games to pull from,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> may look too boring to keep anyone
interested, and yet it still
does. After all, your character is an <tt  >@</tt>, your dog companion a
<tt  >d</tt>, a gold piece is a <tt  >$</tt> and so on. So why is
a game like <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> still so popular? It is because of the incredible
richness and complexity of the game. The idea seems simple enough, but
this is not an easy game and certainly not one you are likely to win in
short order. Deep in the underground levels of the Mazes of Menace (or
the Dungeons of Doom) lies the fabled Amulet of Yendor. To the one who
finds the amulet, untold riches await along with the gift of immortality
bestowed by the Gods. To gain the amulet, you must travel through the
dungeons and mazes, encountering puzzles, strange objects, hidden pits
from which there is no escape, demons, goblins, grid bugs and other
monsters, including the simplest of dangers, hunger and thirst. You may be
a barbarian, a monk, a knight, a wizard or merely a tourist. You may be
human or not. At your side is a small animal companion, a dog or a cat.
</p><p>
I highly recommend that you check out the text version of the game at
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> Web site (see the on-line Resources), but make sure you visit Warren Cheung's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> Web site, home of the &ldquo;Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack,
Extended Magic&rdquo; edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> is <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> kept up to date
with new levels, new monsters, spells and so on. Getting and building
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> is also easier than navigating through the various cryptic
instructions for building the official <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> provides a
simple configure script making this an easy extract-and-build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf se008e0.tar.gz
cd slashem-0.0.8E0
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
To play, run the command <tt  >slashem</tt>. You'll be asked whether
you want the program to pick your character's race, role, gender and
alignment for you or whether you'd like to choose all of these yourself. I
usually prefer to make that choice myself, but you can get some interesting
combinations by being brave and going totally random. Once this is done,
a small introduction tells you about your character and which god
you serve, gives you a nice pat on the back and sends you off to your
doom. It's great fun.
</p><p>
With time, and in keeping with <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>'s evolution, graphical versions
of the game came to be. By using graphic tiles and an easy-to-use
menu-driven interface, the game took on a whole new dimension, all the
while maintaining the same core functionality. One of these graphical
incarnations is Mihael &ldquo;miq&rdquo; Vrbanec's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>gtk2hack</em></span> (based on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> code), a great wrap-around of the latest
version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> that
brings new life to the game (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8491f2.large.jpg"><img src="8491f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. <span  class="emphasis"><em>gtk2hack</em></span> brings a
clean graphical interface to <span  class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> along with a radar providing
feedback on the explored areas.
</p></div></div><p>
As the name implies, <span   class="emphasis"><em>gtk2hack</em></span> is based on the GTK2 toolkit to provide the
interface. It uses a two-dimensional overhead view with nice graphical
tiles to display objects, monsters and so on. There's a small
&ldquo;radar&rdquo;
window that accompanies the main display that you can refer to during
game play. Above the main graphical window, a game dialog is displayed
along with the status of your possessions, your health, hit points,
the level you are exploring and so on. If you have become familiar
with text <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>, you'll find this equally
comfortable. Although you can
navigate with mouse clicks, the same keystrokes apply.
</p><p>
Building <span   class="emphasis"><em>gtk2hack</em></span> is fairly straightforward&mdash;just another slightly
modified extract-and-build five-step (skip the configure step). Because
it comes with its own
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> code bundled
in, you don't
need to download twice. Just remember that the executable is called
gtkhack and not gtk2hack as you might logically expect.
</p><p>
One of the best graphical renditions of the game I have seen (and one of
my favorite games) is Jaakko Peltonen's awesome <span   class="emphasis"><em>Falcon's
Eye</em></span>. Although
not as up to date as <span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> in terms of story and development (it's
based on <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> 3.3.1, whereas
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SLASH'EM</em></span> is based on 3.4.3), you
have to try <span   class="emphasis"><em>Falcon's Eye</em></span>. It's that great, and if you still aren't hooked
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Falcon's Eye</em></span> is sure to do the job. The dungeons enter the
third dimension along with your character, your faithful companion dog
and (of course) the monsters (Figure 3). The game is mouse-driven, and
the graphics are high-resolution. There's a slick panel at the bottom
of the screen from which you can access your possessions, your spells
and other information. Like <span   class="emphasis"><em>gtk2hack</em></span>, there's also a
small &ldquo;radar&rdquo;
screen on the lower left so you can get a better view of where you are
and where you have been.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8491f3.large.jpg"><img src="8491f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The beautiful
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Falcon's Eye</em></span>, shown in windowed mode with transparent walls.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Falcon's Eye</em></span> is available as a source download, but I've found binaries
for a number of distributions (Fedora, SUSE, Debian, Mandriva and
others),
so check your distribution CDs and your distro's contrib sites first.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Falcon's Eye</em></span> starts in full-screen mode by default,
which although
cool, isn't what I want when I'm pretending to work while slaying
goblins. To change the screen resolution to windowed mode, you need to
edit the game's configuration file. It is called jtp_opts.txt,
and you'll find it in the game's config directory. Here's the
section you are looking for:

<pre     class="programlisting">
screen_xsize=800
screen_ysize=600
fullscreen=0
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, I've already changed the resolution to windowed mode
by setting fullscreen to 0. To return to full-screen
mode, change it back to 1. Have a look at the file, and
you'll find other interesting changes you might want to make. One
is to make the walls transparent, or at least not quite as opaque. The
reason you might want to do this is to make it easier to spot objects
that might be against the walls as you navigate the dungeons. You can also
decide whether you want music or sound effects to accompany your journey.
</p><p>
Speaking of journeys, exploring dungeons is extremely thirsty work,
I'd rather avoid those strange potions as long as possible. Luckily,
we have a rather generous wine cellar here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois,
if you would be so kind....
</p><p>
The only catch with <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>&mdash;okay, there are
several catches&mdash;the biggest catch is that it may start to take over every bit of free
time you have. Should you find yourself so addicted that you need to
have <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> with you wherever you go, consider downloading a copy of
NetHack Linux. This is a single-floppy Linux distribution that
boots up directly into a text-based game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span>. The most recent
image contains <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> version 3.4.3, the latest and greatest.
</p><p>
To get your copy of NetHack Linux, visit Benjamin Schieder's Web site (see
Resources) and download the
latest diskette image. Then, transfer the image to a diskette with the
<tt  >dd</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=nethacklinux_1.1.img of=/dev/fd0
</pre>
</p><p>
To run NetHack Linux, simply pop the diskette in to any free PC's drive,
reboot the system and a few seconds later, you are ready to go. A
small menu appears from which you can edit the nethackrc file,
show the current high scores or simply play the game. Select option one
(Play NetHack), and you are ready to go.
</p><p>
I see by the clock on the wall that it is almost closing time. While
Fran&ccedil;ois refills your glasses one final time this evening, let me direct
you to a rather apropos, but strange little Web site. If, after
crawling the Maze of Menaces for far too long, you start wondering what
kind of <span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> monster you would be if you were a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> monster,
I have just the Web site for you. Check out Kevan Davis' &ldquo;Which NetHack
Monster Are You?&rdquo; site and answer the short questionnaire provided. The
results can be entertaining or, in my case, embarrassing. Rather than
embarrass myself by telling you, I'll merely point you to the on-line Resources
for the address to the site. There's also the #nethack
IRC channel on irc.freenode.net where dozens of people talk
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> 24 hours a day. Finally, if you've had just enough wine (and if
not, let Fran&ccedil;ois know) you may be ready for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>NetHack</em></span> theme song.
Please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
