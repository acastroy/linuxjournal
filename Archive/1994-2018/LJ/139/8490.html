After years of painful Web development, here's a
development framework based on understanding how
Web developers really use relational databases. Rails
standardizes the tweaky parts for you to save time.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9b580.0x1d933f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we began looking at Ruby on Rails, a Web development
framework that has captured a great deal of attention in only a short
time. Much of the success of Rails is due to the ease with which
Web/database developers can accomplish various tasks. Indeed, Rails
fans often tout the fact that their applications have almost no
configuration files, allowing programmers to concentrate on
development, rather than logistics.
</p><p>
This month, we begin to look at how Rails works with relational
databases. Even if you won't be using Rails in your own Web
development work, the way Rails addresses many
different issues is extremely elegant and may well influence future
generations of object-relational technologies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9b580.0x1d93558"></a>
The Problem</h2></div></div><p>
The database side to Rails attempts to solve a seemingly simple
problem. Where and how should a Web application store persistent
information? Nearly any Web application we might want to build,
from a shopping cart to a calendar/diary, needs to store its
information somewhere. And because Web applications run on the
server, rather than on the user's desktop, we need to keep track
of data for many different users, rather than just one.
</p><p>
Back in the olden days of Web development, when applications were far
less sophisticated, some of us used basic text files. But we quickly
discovered that a relational database was an improvement on nearly
every level. Relational databases are designed to provide
fast, secure and flexible access to the data that we want&mdash;so long
as we can represent our data as two-dimensional tables.
</p><p>
But as simple as that last sentence makes it sound, moving data from a
program into a database is neither simple nor straightforward. Sure,
the simple stuff is indeed pretty simple; it's not a big deal to keep
track of customers' bank balances, or even the latest transactions in
their checkbooks. But there are big differences between the objects
that are increasingly at the center of the programming world and the
tables that are at the center of the database world.
Consider the
contortions that database programmers go through in representing
arbitrarily deep hierarchies, and you'll begin to understand how the
mapping between objects and tables can be quite complex.
</p><p>
There are basically three ways to bridge this gap
between objects and tables: handle it manually,
replace the tables with objects and use an automatic
mapping tool. The manual approach, which is probably
the most common and popular, simply means that the
programmers stick SQL queries into the code. To get
the contents of a shopping cart, we do something like
this Perl code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# Send the shopping-cart query
my $sql = "SELECT item_id, item_name,
                  item_price, item_quantity
             FROM ShoppingCart
            WHERE user_id = ?";
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare($sql);
$sth-&gt;execute($user_id);

my $total_cost;

print "&lt;table&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt;\n";

# Iterate over the elements of the shopping cart
while (my $rowref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref())
{
    my ($item_id, $item_name, $item_price,
            $item_quantity) = @$rowref;

    $total_cost += $item_price * $item_quantity;

    print "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;$item_name&lt;/td&gt;
               &lt;td&gt;$item_price&lt;/td&gt;
               &lt;td&gt;$item_quantity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n";
}

print "&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Total cost:&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;td&gt;$total_cost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
       &lt;/table&gt;\n";

</pre>
</p><p>
The first few times you write such code, it
doesn't seem so bad. But after a while, it begins to
grate on you. Why are you writing so much SQL, when
all you want is the elements of your shopping cart?
Even if you wrap the SQL inside of an object, you'll
find yourself creating many such objects over the
course of a project.
</p><p>
The people who wrote Zope, a Python-based Web application framework,
decided that although relational databases have their place, the real
solution to this problem is to avoid the object-table translation as
much as possible, opting instead for an object database. ZODB
(Zope Object Database) thus allows you to store and retrieve Python
objects as part of a hierarchy. If you can represent data in a Python
object, ZODB makes it easy to keep that data persistently.
</p><p>
But of course, ZODB has its problems as well. To begin with, you can
use it only from Python; by contrast, relational databases
typically can be accessed from any number of languages. And although ZODB
now has multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), transactions and a
host of other features, the fact that it simply stores a set of
objects means that you can't easily sort, search or perform
&ldquo;joins&rdquo;,
which are the cornerstone of the relational world.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9b580.0x1d93920"></a>
Object-Relational Mappers</h2></div></div><p>
The third alternative, namely that of having an object-relational
mapper, has become increasingly popular. The basic idea is pretty
simple. Your program uses objects, and those objects are automatically
transformed into rows, columns and tables in a relational database.
</p><p>
For many years, object-relational mappers have had all sorts of
difficulties, particularly when working with sophisticated data sets.
But they are now increasingly robust and impressive; and though I have not
worked with either of them, Hibernate (for Java programmers) and
SQLObject (for Python programmers) offer just these sorts of services,
and Alzabo (described in this column several years ago) provides such
services for Perl programmers. When implemented correctly,
object-relational mappers provide the best of both worlds, including
all of the speed, cross-language and maintenance benefits of a
relational database along with the flexibility and consistency of
working with objects from within the code.
</p><p>
When Rails burst onto the Web development scene about a year ago, its
proponents touted the fact that Rails allows you to produce a
Web/database application with almost no configuration and with very
little code. And indeed, this is the case, thanks to several
different features. One of the key features that makes this possible,
however, is a sophisticated object-relational mapper known as
ActiveRecord.
</p><p>
ActiveRecord is a Ruby class that is traditionally used as the parent
of model classes within a Rails application. As you may recall, Rails
uses the traditional model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm to build Web
applications. Unlike some MVC application frameworks, Rails makes the
differences between these explicit, creating models, views and
controllers subdirectories within the application's app directory.
A model class in Rails doesn't have to inherit from ActiveRecord, in
which case it functions like any other data structure or class. But
if it does inherit from ActiveRecord (or more precisely, from
ActiveRecord::Base), the object knows how to store and retrieve its
values from a table in a relational database.
</p><p>
At this point, you might be asking, &ldquo;Wait a second&mdash;how is it possible that inheritance alone can
provide an object-relational mapping? Don't I need
to configure something?&rdquo; The short answer, amazing
as it might seem, is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. There is, of course,
a slight trade-off, one that might bruise your ego
if you aren't careful. Rails is able to accomplish
this magic by forcing all programs to adhere to a
particular set of conventions. Indeed, one of the
Rails mantras is &ldquo;convention over configuration.&rdquo;
If you are willing to name your tables, columns
and objects according to the accepted convention,
Rails will reward you handsomely. If you insist
on using your own conventions, or if you want to
connect Rails to an existing set of tables, you
might find yourself struggling to implement even the
simplest application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9b580.0x1d93c90"></a>
Connecting</h2></div></div><p>
So, how do we connect Rails to our database? Much of the
documentation I have seen uses the popular open-source MySQL
database for its examples; I strongly prefer PostgreSQL, and thus
use it in my examples instead. However, you will soon see that the choice of
a back-end database is almost invisible when it comes to Rails.
</p><p>
If you haven't done so already, install the Ruby Gems
package, and then use the gem command to install Rails, all of its
dependent classes and postgres-pr:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gem install --remote rails
$ gem install --remote postgres-pr
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we use the rails command to create a new Rails application. If
you still don't have the Weblog application we began last month, you
can create it by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rails blog
</pre>
</p><p>
In many Web/database frameworks, the individual page or program must
connect to the database each time. In Rails, the underlying system
connects to the database for us, automatically tying the database
connection to the ActiveRecord object class. The configuration is
kept under the application directory in config/database.yml. No,
that's not a typo; the extension is yml
(YAML, or Yet Another Markup Language, or YAML Ain't a Markup
Language), a simplified text format that is easier to read, write and parse than XML.
</p><p>
Traditionally, every Rails application uses three different databases,
one each for development, testing and production. These three
databases are created with a prefix that reflects the application
name and a suffix that reflects its use (either development,
test or production). For example, this is the database.yml file
for the blog application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
development:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: blog_development
  host: localhost
  username: blog
  password:

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: blog_test
  host: localhost
  username: blog
  password:

production:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: blog_production
  host: localhost
  username: blog
  password:
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the database adapter name is postgresql,
even though I used the postgres-pr gem to connect
to it. Also notice that the database is accessed by
a user named blog. For this to work
correctly, I now have to create the blog
user in PostgreSQL (not as a Linux user):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createuser -U postgres blog
Shall the new user be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new user be allowed to create more new users? (y/n) n
CREATE USER
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we have created the blog user, we use it to create
the three databases:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb -U blog blog_development
CREATE DATABASE
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb -U blog blog_test
CREATE DATABASE
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb -U blog blog_production
CREATE DATABASE
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we should create a table in our database. We use only
the development database for now, but we adhere to the
convention of writing our table definitions in the blog/db directory,
in a file named create.sql:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Blogs (
id           SERIAL   NOT NULL,
title        TEXT     NOT NULL,
contents     TEXT     NOT NULL,

 PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
I have already mentioned the importance of following Rails conventions
when working with the ActiveRecord object-relational mapper, and the
above table definition, as simple as it seems, already uncovers two of
them. To begin with, every row has a unique ID field named id.
(PostgreSQL, following SQL standards, has case-insensitive table and
column names by default.) In PostgreSQL, we ensure that every row has
a unique value of id by declaring it to be a SERIAL type. If you're
like me, and have always used more explicit names (such as, blog_id)
for the primary key, you'll need to change in order to work with
Rails.
</p><p>
Another convention, and one that is a bit more subtle
to notice, is that our table name is Blogs, a plural
word. A class descended from ActiveRecord::Base
is automatically mapped to a database table with
the same name, but pluralized. So if we create a
blog class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base in
models/blog.rb, it is automatically mapped to
the blogs table in our database. As you can see,
your choice of a name can affect the readability of
your code; be sure to choose a name that makes
sense in a number of different contexts, both singular
and plural. (In this case, my choice of words was
admittedly unfortunate, because each row of the Blogs
table represents one posting, rather than one Weblog.)
</p><p>
But it gets better&mdash;we don't need to create blog.rb ourselves, at
least not at first. We can ask Rails to create it for us, using
script/generate. script/generate can be used to create a model,
controller or view; in this case, we create our model:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/generate model blog
</pre>
</p><p>
You will see some output that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exists  app/models/
exists  test/unit/
exists  test/fixtures/
create  app/models/blog.rb
create  test/unit/blog_test.rb
create  test/fixtures/blogs.yml
</pre>
</p><p>
If we open up app/models/blog.rb, we see that it's nearly empty:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Blog &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Although we can (and will) add new methods to our Blog class, we can
actually leave it as it stands. That's because ActiveRecord provides
our class with enough skeleton methods that we can get by without
them.
</p><p>
Although it's nice that we now have a Ruby class that is automatically
mapped to our Blogs table in the database, we still have to access
our table via the Web. This means we need to create a
controller class, because controllers (the C in MVC) are the
components in Rails that handle incoming HTTP requests. We can
generate a controller automatically:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/generate controller blogadmin
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, this controller isn't tied to our class
at all. And although we could make such a connection
ourselves, the fact that we're at the very beginning
of our application definition means we can take
a bit of a shortcut, asking Rails to generate an
entire set of scaffolding, or bare-bones classes,
that will do much of what we want. Creating such
scaffolding is a great way to get jump-started with
Rails development or even for working on a new
project. At the same time, generating the scaffolding
means blowing away class definitions you
already have written. Because we have (so far) used only the
default classes, this shouldn't be much of a problem.
</p><p>
We generate the scaffolded application with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/generate scaffolding Blog Admin
</pre>
</p><p>
(You should answer &ldquo;Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;a&rdquo; to replace one or all of the existing
files, as appropriate.)
</p><p>
This creates a controller class named Admin that gives us basic
access to a Blog class. The latter then connects to the Blogs
table in the database.
</p><p>
With only the scaffolding in place, we can now start the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/server
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9b580.0x1d948f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then, we point our browser to the application, at the /admin URL:
http://localhost:3000/admin.
</p><p>
Sure enough, we see&mdash;nothing at all, aside from a few links
that let us add a new entry into our Blogs table. If you
click on add, you now will see a form that lets you create a
new Weblog entry. These automatically generated pages are in the
app/views subdirectory. In particular, look at new.rhtml and
list.rhtml in app/views/admin. You can, of course, change these
views&mdash;and in a production application, you will. But for getting
your feet wet with Rails, or just trying out an application idea, this
is indeed pretty useful.
</p><p>
Now, when you go to the add page, you might be surprised to discover
that there is one field for each of the columns in the Blogs table,
except for id. This is the result of some cleverness on the part of
the automatically generated scaffolding code; it looked at the table
definitions and decided what kind of input area to show. What
happens if we add another column to our Blogs table that represents
when the blog entry was added? (After all, a Weblog whose contents
aren't sorted in date order isn't going to be very useful.)
</p><p>
To save time, we simply go in and modify our table definition,
using the ALTER TABLE command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ psql -U blog blog
% ALTER TABLE Blogs ADD COLUMN posted_at
        TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW();
</pre>
</p><p>
If you look at the table definition (with the \d command in the
psql client program), you'll see that it now has a new column named
posted_at. The naming conventions in Rails extend to the
names of columns; columns of type DATE should be named xxx_on, and
columns of type TIMESTAMP (that is, both date and time) should be named
xxx_at.
</p><p>
We now need to regenerate our scaffolding code, blowing away any
previous version that might have existed (which is okay in this
particular case):

<pre     class="programlisting">
ruby script/generate scaffolding Blog Admin
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, restart the server and go back to the new blog page. You will see
that it has changed, so that it now includes a posted at field.
Moreover, you can't enter arbitrary text there; a full-blown
date-entry set of selection lists is in place. If you ever
have written code to handle the entry of dates in a Web application, this
alone should be a pleasant change.
</p><p>
Finally, take some time to explore both the
application (using your Web browser) and the updates
that take place in the database as you add, modify
and delete rows. Without having written even a single
line of Ruby code, you should find yourself able
to use the Web-based forms to modify the database.
If you want to be a bit adventurous, you can even
modify list.rhtml, which shows you the current list
of blog entries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c9b580.0x1d8b5a0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Many Web/database frameworks have struggled to offer a persistent
storage layer that interfaces cleanly with the programming language
itself. Embedded SQL code isn't too terrible on a small scale, but
even a medium-size application can result in a great deal of SQL
queries in the middle of an otherwise object-oriented application.
The Rails solution strikes a balance that I find quite pleasing,
forcing very small, logical changes on me in exchange for a great deal
of time savings.
</p><p>
Of course, it's not very hard to create an object-relational mapper
when all you need to worry about is column types and individual
tables. Moreover, you'll quickly discover that as written, our simple
blog application has several problems. To begin with, it has an
administrative interface, but no method for displaying the blog to the
world! Also, it doesn't display blog entries in any sort of
chronological order. Next month, we will see how to solve these
problems, as well as how Rails enforces data integrity with a few
simple lines in our model definitions.
