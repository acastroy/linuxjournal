Some of your old favorites dropped off the Readers' Choice results
this year. Has the Linux scene changed for good?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x12261e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Editor's Note: This article has been updated since its original
publication.</em></span>.
</p><p>
We overhauled the voting process for this year's Readers' Choice Awards
in the hope of creating a fairer system that voters were involved in
every step of the way. As such, we accepted nominations from readers in
31 categories and then held two rounds of voting to get this final list
of your favorites.
</p><p>
Some readers were surprised by the list of
candidates that made it to the final round. For instance, the big-name
distributions, such as Debian, Red Hat and SUSE, were nowhere to be
found. Although these absences may seem odd, we call these the Readers'
Choice awards because they are exactly that&mdash;these are the products and
tools our readers are using and loving this year.
</p><p>
Here we present the top two vote-getters in each category. In categories
where vote totals were particularly close, we have listed the top three
finishers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1226450"></a>Favorite Audio Tool</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>XMMS</p></li><li><p>amaroK</p></li></ol></div><p>
For the sixth year in a row, XMMS is the first-place finisher in the
audio tool category. So you know XMMS plays MP3, OGG, WAV and CD audio
file formats. You also probably know that it supports a whole bunch of
third-party input plugins. But do you know about its equalizer and
playlist capabilities? Do you know about its advanced plugins for file
I/O, special effects and visualization? If not, you must have missed
Dave Phillips' article on &ldquo;Getting the Most from XMMS with
Plugins&rdquo; (see the on-line Resources for links to articles), which covered some of the functionality that
helps keep this classic tool a favorite.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1226768"></a>Favorite Backup System</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Amanda</p></li><li><p>Bacula</p></li></ol></div><p>
We split backups into two categories this year to differentiate between
simple tools that can back up a single system (see Favorite Backup Utility
below) and more complex programs
administered centrally to back up multiple machines.
Although not as flashy as some other backup systems, Amanda (advanced
Maryland automatic disk archiver) offers &ldquo;a reliable platform for
many Linux and UNIX users who are comfortable with a command-line
interface&rdquo;, according to Phil Moses, who wrote about it for us in
&ldquo;Open-Source Backups Using Amanda&rdquo;. Apparently, many of our
readers agree.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1226ad8"></a>Favorite Backup Utility</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>tar</p></li><li><p>rsync</p></li></ol></div><p>
Even though many backup tools are available from vendors, we know that
our readers often prefer to stick with the basics. Thus, your favorite
backup utilities, tar and rsync, are basic command-line tools that were
separated by less than a hundred votes in this year's competition. You
can do a lot with tar, from building basic single-file archives to
creating multivolume backups. Sometimes, though, the most tried-and-true
tools are the ones we take for granted, so to learn more about what you
can do with tar and rsync, take a look at these past <i  >LJ</i>
articles: &ldquo;The Skinny on Backups and Data Recover, Part 3&rdquo;,
&ldquo;LVM and Removable IDE Drives Backup System&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rsync, Part I and Part II&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1226ef8"></a>Favorite Database</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>MySQL</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL</p></li></ol></div><p>
Celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, MySQL once again scores the
top place in this year's voting. Besides offering more features than
ever, MySQL also is being included in more big-name vendor products,
thanks to the ever-increasing popularity of LAMP applications. In
&ldquo;An Open Letter to the Community from MySQL Founders David
Axmark &amp; Michael &lsquo;Monty&rsquo; Widenius&rdquo;, the founders
offered these impressive stats: &ldquo;over 100 million copies of MySQL
have been distributed&rdquo; through the Web site and operating system
distributions; approximately 40,000 new downloads every day; more than
1,500 projects on SourceForge.net are using MySQL; and current users
include Craigslist, Slashdot, Wikipedia, Bugzilla, Technorati and the
Human Genome Project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x12272c0"></a>Favorite Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>KDE</p></li><li><p>GNOME</p></li></ol></div><p>
The dot.kde.org site carried a link to the Readers' Choice
voting page this year&mdash;did the extra promotion to
KDE fans make the difference? As detailed below,
this year's favorite distribution is GNOME-based while the favorite
language is the base language for KDE. People
seem to be using the best technologies from both environments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1227580"></a>Favorite Desktop Workstation</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Dell</p></li><li><p>Apple</p></li><li><p>Monarch</p></li></ol></div><p>
People like Dell's boxes, but it's still confusing
to buy anything but a top-of-the-line workstation
from them if you want to run Linux. And even then, according to the Dell
Linux Engineering page,
&ldquo;all Dell N-Series
Precision Workstation desktops are available and supported with Red Hat
Linux. For help running other Linux distributions on your Workstation,
you might consider posting to or viewing the linux-precision mailing
list.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8520f1.large.jpg"><img src="8520f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Dell Precision 380 Workstation
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1227b00"></a>Favorite Development Tool</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>GCC</p></li><li><p>KDevelop</p></li><li><p>Eclipse</p></li></ol></div><p>
Wait a second before skipping to the next category&mdash;this result
isn't as boring as you might think. Yes, GCC won again, but it's a whole
new GCC world out there. Earlier this year, Tom Tromey wrote that GCC &ldquo;has
undergone many changes in the last few years. One change in particular,
the merging of the tree-ssa branch, has made it much simpler to write a
new GCC front end.&rdquo; Find out why in &ldquo;Writing a GCC Front
End&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1620170"></a>Favorite Distribution</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Ubuntu</p></li><li><p>CentOS</p></li><li><p>Fedora Core</p></li></ol></div><p>
Judging by the comments posted on the <i  >LJ</i> Web site during the
voting process, a lot of voters were &ldquo;shocked&rdquo; and
&ldquo;flabbergasted&rdquo; that the brand-new Ubuntu made it to the final
round, while Red Hat,
Debian, SUSE and other big names were absent. Maybe it's a passing
phase of Ubuntu mania, but as Steve Hastings wrote in his
<i  >LJ</i> review, &ldquo;Ubuntu Linux is an excellent
choice for anyone who wants to run Linux on a desktop system. It's easy
to install and to administer. Everyone from beginners to experts can use
and appreciate it. And it's free.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8520f2.large.jpg"><img src="8520f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Ubuntu: Linux for Human Beings. Linux users
around the world have surged to Ubuntu this year. You have to feel good
about using a distribution whose name means &ldquo;humanity to
others&rdquo;.</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x16208a8"></a>Favorite E-Mail Client</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Mozilla Thunderbird</p></li><li><p>Evolution</p></li></ol></div><p>
In the early days of the Readers' Choice Awards, the top finishers in
this category always were mutt, pine and other text-based programs. The
last couple of years, though, the majority of readers&mdash;at least the
voting ones&mdash;have given up the basics for one of the smooth new
GUI-based clients. And Thunderbird seems to be responsible for a lot of
these conversions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8520f3.large.jpg"><img src="8520f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Thunderbird's interface will look familiar to users
of other GUI-based and Web e-mail programs. But it's better.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1620d20"></a>Favorite Embedded Distribution</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Qtopia</p></li><li><p>LFS</p></li><li><p>OpenZaurus</p></li></ol></div><p>
Nitpickers might say that Qtopia isn't a
distribution because it doesn't include the kernel,
but it's a full-featured embedded development environment.
Qtopia is built on Qt/Embedded, the
C++ GUI
and platform development tool for Linux-based embedded development.
You get all the source code and can do whatever customization you want.
Everyone from Samsung to Motorola and Phillips is using Qtopia for PDAs,
cell phones and other cool new gadgets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1621090"></a>Favorite Graphics Program</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The GIMP</p></li><li><p>Inkscape</p></li></ol></div><p>
Everyone knows The GIMP rules this category and has for practically the
past decade. But wow, there are a lot of votes for Inkscape this year.
Our editors selected it for an Editors' Choice Award earlier this year
as well. So maybe it's time the rest of you take a look at Inkscape,
especially if you're concerned about making your graphics look good
at a variety of screen sizes by using a vector format.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1621350"></a>Favorite Instant Messaging Client</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Gaim</p></li><li><p>Kopete</p></li></ol></div><p>
Gaim integrates with both GNOME and KDE, thereby setting a desktop application
paradigm for the future&mdash;an application that plays standards, not
desktop wars. Besides that, the selection of smiley-face icons is great
for adding a touch of sarcasm with a well-placed smiley-face wearing a
halo or shedding a tear.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1621610"></a>Favorite Linux Book</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>, 4th Edition</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Gentoo Handbook</em></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>A Quarter Century of UNIX</em></span></p></li></ol></div><p>
Here's a fun project for a cold fall evening: compare the table of
contents in the first edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> to
the one in the fourth edition, and see how much more you can do now and
how much less time you need to spend tweaking low-level stuff. Much
space in the first edition, for example, was used to explain things
such as kermit and elm&mdash;it even brought up troff (shudder).
The fourth edition, however, talks about KDE and GNOME, not to
mention the final section on Web development with LAMP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1621ae0"></a>Favorite Linux Game</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal Tournament

We know it's not your fault that you keep playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen

Yes, we know training is important and the horrors of what can happen
when a poorly trained sysadmin is set loose in a server room. But we
don't know why IBM won; in the ads, that kid who looks like
Eminem's little brother seems pretty bored. Maybe a Mick Bauer
live security intrusion demo would hold his attention a little better.

Readers always will have a special place in their hearts for a Web site
that, on one page worth of headlines, offers updates on PSP 2.0,
marketing strategies for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Firefly</em></span> (Joss
Whedon's canceled TV show that made it to the big screen), Google's
new IM client and house-sitting robots in Japan.

Oh, Fran&ccedil;ois, the readers, they love you still. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Un affair de
coeur,
c'est tr&iuml;&iquest;&frac12; beau, non?</em></span> 2005 was pretty significant for the
second- and third-place finishers, as regular Paranoid Penguin columnist
Mick Bauer
turned it over to a rotating author list and Reuven Lerner celebrated
his 100th At the Forge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x1533578"></a>Favorite Media Player</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>MPlayer</p></li><li><p>Xine</p></li><li><p>Kaffeine</p></li></ol></div><p>
We know our US readers aren't actually running
MPlayer because of the software patent situation,
but it's nice to see what people in countries with
more sensible patent systems can do.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8520f5.large.jpg"><img src="8520f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>For our readers living outside the US,

Besides the fact that Astaro works well, our readers appreciate that
the Astaro box isn't just a
&ldquo;firewall&rdquo; in the ordinary packet-filtering sense.
It also comes with antispam, antivirus, intrusion detection and
a Web proxy&mdash;features
that would be expensive add-ons for other firewalls.

Garnering over a thousand votes more than the second-place finisher, OOo
has built a strong following in the Linux and Open Source community,
thanks to its compatability and usability&mdash;not to mention our
monthly Web column by Bruce Byfield, OOo Off the Wall. Check out his
past columns on the LinuxJournal.com site for great documentation on using
fields, creating templates and organizing work flows. And don't miss the
reader comments, where questions are asked, answered, debated,
clarified and argued some more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x15341d8"></a>Favorite Portable Workstation</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>IBM ThinkPad</p></li><li><p>Apple PowerBook</p></li><li><p>Dell Latitude</p></li></ol></div><p>We're all in suspense about what the
new ThinkPad company, Lenovo, is going to do
Linux-wise. Although ThinkPads are a common sight at
Linux conferences, every one has to be tweaked or
ordered through a company, such as EmperorLinux, that
does a custom install for you. Do a Google search for
ThinkPad, and right after thinkpad.com comes a Linux
site, and six of the top ten results are Linux-related.
HP's Linux laptop mysteriously vanished from the
company's Web site without a trace, but maybe Lenovo
will listen to their Linux-using fans instead of
falling prey to mysterious marketing conspiracies.

Back in early 2003, Don Marti asked the following question regarding C++:
&ldquo;Now that we have GCC 3.2.x...and an increasing
collection of interesting free software using C++, is it time to
take a second look at this perhaps unfairly maligned language?&rdquo; He didn't expect that a mere two years later, C++ would win here.
A lot of that has to be the rapid growth of Linux to include the world's
C++ coders&mdash;welcome to Linux, all of you.

The LinuxJournal.com editor would like to point out that the site published
&ldquo;Setting Up Subversion for One or Multiple Projects&rdquo;

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112e580.0x17b0be0"></a>Favorite Virtualization Solution</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>VMware</p></li><li><p>Xen</p></li></ol></div><p>
Virtualization is becoming bigger news these days. VMware
lets you run an unmodified guest OS and
has been around for longer than the rest, so one or both of these
factors matters to voters. If you're new to VMware, we suggest you start
by reading &ldquo;VMware 5 Workstation Edition Reviewed&rdquo; to get an
