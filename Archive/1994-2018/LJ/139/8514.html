Do something for freedom every day, especially when you're

Since this is my last column as editor in chief,
I get to give a bunch of advice, so I'll cover two
great inventions that we should all take a fresh look
at and come up with more things like them. First,
the most important technology for the Internet isn't
on the Internet. Want a hint? 12:00. 12:00. 12:00.
The second most important technology has a symbol
that you probably look at in a Web browser several
times a day.
</p><p>
And I get to thank people for making the <i  >Linux Journal</i> editor job the best job ever. Edsger Dijkstra
once wrote, &ldquo;Besides a mathematical inclination, an
exceptionally good mastery of one's native tongue is
the most vital asset of a competent programmer.&rdquo; By
this measure, our authors are competent programmers,
some even in a non-native human language. There has
been no better way for me to get my Linux questions
answered than to assign articles to these informed,
helpful people.
</p><p>
Thanks to the editorial staff too. <i  >Linux Journal</i>
is fortunate to have Jill Franklin's managerial,
editorial and XMLitorial skills; Heather Mead's
quiet but effective powers that bring in links
like few other Linux sites; and of course Garrick
Antikajian's eye for good design, even when it
includes hairy-looking code. Thank you all for not
selling out to the Mainstream IT Media and sticking
with your fans.
</p><p>
The humble VCR clock is the Internet's most important
technology because it saved civilization in 1984.
The big movie studios wanted to create a standard
for copyright infringement that would crush any
new communications technology. In a scarily close
decision&mdash;5 to 4&mdash;the Supreme Court allowed the
VCR to exist because you can use it for time-shifting.
</p><p>
The principle got a thorough test in the Grokster case
decided this June, and although the new &ldquo;affirmative
steps to foster infringement&rdquo; test will surely scare
the venture capitalists away from media-oriented
startups, the so-called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sony</em></span> principle gives
you the right to continue inventing.
</p><p>
The lesson here is that lawmakers and courts look
at the wrappers of things and their real uses,
not just at principles. If an invention is great
for freedom, put a big obvious &ldquo;clock&rdquo; on it&mdash;a way for it to prove itself to society. How about
a virus checker updater that uses a new P2P system?
Inventing has always been part showmanship, and the
features of an invention let it speak for itself in
debates about laws and norms.
</p><p>
If you thought in the 1980s that you would be able
to participate in global communication and commerce
using freely licensed software and high-grade crypto
on a cheap computer, you should probably tone your
optimism down a little. Our other invention to
appreciate is the little &ldquo;lock&rdquo; in the Web browser.
The Internet doesn't work for business transactions
without strong crypto. Every big company that wants
to run a shopping site, share documents with traveling
employees or run a remote backup had to join the
side of freedom in the crypto debate.
When inventing something that makes big business
sense, build in a dependency on freedom and enroll
powerful interests on freedom's side.
</p><p>
This is really our best issue yet. We have a
brand-new feature of the latest kernel, possibly the
most productive Web tool ever, a Beowulf cluster
in a toolbox, freedom-enabled tools for designing
electronics projects and of course a real-time Linux
pinball machine. Stay free and enjoy the issue.
