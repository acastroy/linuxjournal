Applications that
watch thousands of files for changes, or that need to know
when a storage device gets disconnected, need a clean,
fast solution to the file change notification problem. Here it
is.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbff348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
John McCutchan and I had been working on inotify for about a year when
it was finally merged into Linus' kernel tree and released with kernel
version 2.6.13. Although a long struggle, the effort culminated in
success and was ultimately worth every rewrite, bug and debate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbff450"></a>
What Is inotify?</h2></div></div><p>
inotify is a file change notification system&mdash;a kernel feature that
allows applications to request the monitoring of a set of files against
a list of events. When the event occurs, the application is notified. To
be useful, such a feature must be simple to use, lightweight with little
overhead and flexible. It should be easy to add new watches and painless
to receive notification of events.
</p><p>
To be sure, inotify is not the first of its
kind. Every modern operating system provides some sort
of file notification system; many network and desktop
applications require such functionality&mdash;Linux too.
For years, Linux has offered dnotify. The
problem was, dnotify was not very good. In fact,
it stank.
</p><p>
dnotify, which ostensibly stands for directory notify, was never
considered easy to use. Sporting a cumbersome interface and several
painful features that made life arduous, dnotify
failed to meet the demands of the modern desktop, where asynchronous
notification of events and a free flow of information rapidly are becoming
the norm. dnotify has, in particular, several problems:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
dnotify can watch only directories.
</p></li><li><p>
dnotify requires maintaining an open file descriptor to
the directory that the user wants to watch. First, this open file
descriptor pins the directory, disallowing the device on which it resides
from being
unmounted. Second, watching a large number of directories requires too
many open file descriptors.
</p></li><li><p>
dnotify's interface to user space is
signals. Yes, seriously, signals!
</p></li><li><p>
dnotify ignores the issue of hard links.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The goal, therefore, was twofold: design a first-class file notification
system and ensure that all of the deficiencies of dnotify were addressed.
</p><p>
inotify is an inode-based file notification system that does not require
a file ever be opened in order to watch it. inotify does not pin
filesystem mounts&mdash;in fact, it has a clever event that notifies the user
whenever a file's backing filesystem is unmounted. inotify is able to
watch any filesystem object whatsoever, and when watching directories,
it is able to tell the user the name of the file inside of the directory
that changed. dnotify can report only that <span   class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> changed,
requiring applications to maintain an in-memory cache of stat()
results and compare for any changes.
</p><p>
Finally, inotify is designed with an interface that user-space
application developers would want to use, enjoy using and benefit from
using. Instead of signals, inotify communicates with applications via a
single file descriptor. This file descriptor is select-, poll-, epoll-
and read-able. Simple and fast&mdash;the world is happy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbffa80"></a>
Getting Started with inotify</h2></div></div><p>
inotify is available in kernel 2.6.13-rc3 and
later. Because some bugs were found and subsequently
fixed right after that release, kernel 2.6.13 or later
is recommended. The inotify system calls, being the
new kids on the block, might not yet be supported
in your system's version of the C library, in which
case the header files listed in the on-line Resources
will provide the necessary C declarations and system
call stubs.
</p><p>
If your C library supports inotify, all you should
need is the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;sys/inotify.h&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If not, grab the two header files, stick them in the same directory as
your source files, and use the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#include "inotify.h"
#include "inotify-syscalls.h"
</pre>
</p><p>
The following examples are in straight C. You can compile them the same
as any other C application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbffd40"></a>
Initialize, inotify!</h2></div></div><p>
inotify is initialized via the inotify_init() system call, which
instantiates an inotify instance inside the kernel and returns the
associated file descriptor:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int inotify_init (void);
</pre>
</p><p>
On failure, inotify_init() returns minus one and sets
errno as appropriate. The most common errno values are
EMFILE and ENFILE, which signify that the per-user and
the system-wide open file limit was reached, respectively.
</p><p>
Usage is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int fd;

fd = inotify_init ();
if (fd &lt; 0)
        perror ("inotify_init");

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbfffa8"></a>
Watches</h2></div></div><p>
The heart of inotify is the watch, which consists of a pathname
specifying what to watch and an event mask specifying what to watch
for. inotify can watch for many different events: opens, closes, reads,
writes, creates, deletes, moves, metadata changes and unmounts. Each
inotify instance can have thousands of watches, each watch for a different
list of events.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xc000b0"></a>
Adding Watches</h2></div></div><p>
Watches are added with the inotify_add_watch()
system call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int inotify_add_watch (int fd, const char *path, __u32 mask);
</pre>
</p><p>
A call to inotify_add_watch() adds
a watch for the one or more events given by the
bitmask mask on the file path to the
inotify instance associated with the file descriptor
fd. On success, the call returns a watch
descriptor, which is used to identify this
particular watch uniquely. On failure, minus one is returned
and errno is set as appropriate.
</p><p>
Usage is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int wd;

wd = inotify_add_watch (fd,
                "/home/rlove/Desktop",
                IN_MODIFY | IN_CREATE | IN_DELETE);

if (wd &lt; 0)
        perror ("inotify_add_watch");

</pre>
</p><p>
This example adds a watch on the directory /home/rlove/Desktop
for any modifications, file creations or file deletions.
</p><p>
Table 1 shows valid events.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xb07580.0xc003c8"></a><p class="title"><b>

Table 2 shows the provided helper events.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf7d30"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. Helper Events

As an example, if an application wanted to know
whenever the file safe_combination.txt was
opened or closed, it could do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int wd;

wd = inotify_add_watch (fd,
                "safe_combination.txt",
                IN_OPEN | IN_CLOSE);

if (wd &lt; 0)
        perror ("inotify_add_watch");

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf84c0"></a>
Receiving Events</h2></div></div><p>
With inotify initialized and watches added, your application is now
ready to receive events. Events are queued asynchronously, in real time
as the events happen, but they are read synchronously via the read()
system call. The call blocks until events are ready and then returns
all available events once any event is queued.
</p><p>
Events are delivered in the form of an inotify_event structure,
which is defined as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
struct inotify_event {
        __s32 wd;             /* watch descriptor */
        __u32 mask;           /* watch mask */
        __u32 cookie;         /* cookie to synchronize two events */
        __u32 len;            /* length (including nulls) of name */
        char name[0];        /* stub for possible name */
};
</pre>
</p><p>
The wd field is the watch descriptor originally returned by
inotify_add_watch(). The application is responsible for mapping
this identifier back to the filename.
</p><p>
The mask field is a bitmask representing the event that occurred.
</p><p>
The cookie field is a unique identifier linking together two
related but separate events. It is used to link together an IN_MOVED_FROM
and an IN_MOVED_TO event. We will look at it later.
</p><p>
The len field is the length of the name field or nonzero
if this event does not have a name. The length contains any potential
padding&mdash;that is, the result of strlen() on the name
field may be smaller than len.
</p><p>
The name field contains the name of the object to which the
event occurred, relative to wd, if applicable. For
example, if a watch for writes in /etc triggers an event on
the writing to /etc/vimrc, the name field will contain
vimrc, and the wd field will link back to the /etc
watch. Conversely, if watching the file /etc/fstab for reads, a
triggered read event will have a len of zero and no associated
name whatsoever, because the watch descriptor associates directly with
the affected file.
</p><p>
The size of name is dynamic. If the event has no associated
filename, no name is sent at all and no space is consumed. If the event
does have an associated filename, the name field is dynamically
allocated and trails the structure for len bytes. This approach
allows the name's length to vary in size and consume no space when
not needed.
</p><p>
Because the name field is dynamic, the size
of the buffer passed to read() is unknown. If
the size is too small, the system call returns
zero, alerting the application. inotify, however,
allows user space to &ldquo;slurp&rdquo; multiple events at
once. Consequently, most applications should pass in
a large buffer, which inotify will fill with as many
events as possible.
</p><p>
It sounds complicated, but usage is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* size of the event structure, not counting name */
#define EVENT_SIZE  (sizeof (struct inotify_event))

/* reasonable guess as to size of 1024 events */
#define BUF_LEN        (1024 * (EVENT_SIZE + 16)

char buf[BUF_LEN];
int len, i = 0;

len = read (fd, buf, BUF_LEN);
if (len &lt; 0) {
        if (errno == EINTR)
                /* need to reissue system call */
        else
                perror ("read");
} else if (!len)
        /* BUF_LEN too small? */

while (i &lt; len) {
        struct inotify_event *event;

        event = (struct inotify_event *) &amp;buf[i];

        printf ("wd=%d mask=%u cookie=%u len=%u\n",
                event-&gt;wd, event-&gt;mask,
                event-&gt;cookie, event-&gt;len);

        if (event-&gt;len)
                printf ("name=%s\n", event-&gt;name);

        i += EVENT_SIZE + event-&gt;len;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This approach is undertaken to allow many events to be read and processed
in a single swoop and to deal with the dynamically sized name. Clever
readers will immediately question whether the following code is safe with
respect to alignment requirements:

<pre     class="programlisting">

while (i &lt; len) {
        struct inotify_event *event;
        event = (struct inotify_event *) &amp;buf[i];

        /* ... */

        i += EVENT_SIZE + event-&gt;len;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Indeed, it is. This is
the reason that the len field may be longer than the string's
length. Additional null characters may follow the string, padding it out
to a size that ensures the following structure is properly aligned.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf8af0"></a>
But I Don't Want to Read!</h2></div></div><p>
Having to sit blocked on a read() system call does not sound very
appealing, unless your application is heavily threaded&mdash;in which case,
hey, just one more thread! Thankfully, the inotify file descriptor can be
polled or selected on, allowing inotify to be multiplexed along
with other I/O and optionally integrated into an application's mainloop.
</p><p>
Here is an example of monitoring the inotify file descriptor with
select():

<pre     class="programlisting">

struct timeval time;
fd_set rfds;
int ret;

/* timeout after five seconds */
time.tv_sec = 5;
time.tv_usec = 0;

/* zero-out the fd_set */
FD_ZERO (&amp;rfds);

/*
 * add the inotify fd to the fd_set -- of course,
 * your application will probably want to add
 * other file descriptors here, too
 */
FD_SET (fd, &amp;rfds);

ret = select (fd + 1, &amp;rfds, NULL, NULL, &amp;time);
if (ret &lt; 0)
        perror ("select");
else if (!ret)
        /* timed out! */
else if (FD_ISSET (fd, &amp;rfds)
        /* inotify events are available! */

</pre>
</p><p>
You can follow a similar approach with pselect(), poll()
or epoll()&mdash;take your pick.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf8d00"></a>
Events</h2></div></div><p>
The mask field in the inotify_event structure describes
the event that occurred. In addition to the events listed earlier,
Table 3 shows events that are also sent, as applicable.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf8e08"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 3. Events That Cover General Changes
</b></p><table     summary="Table 3. Events That Cover General Changes&#10;" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><tt  >IN_UNMOUNT</tt></td><td>The backing filesystem was unmounted.</td></tr><tr><td><tt  >IN_Q_OVERFLOW</tt></td><td>The inotify queue overflowed.</td></tr><tr><td><tt  >IN_IGNORED</tt></td><td>The watch was automatically removed,
because the file was deleted or its filesystem was unmounted.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Additionally, the bit IN_ISDIR is set telling the application
if the event occurred against a directory. This is more than just a
convenience&mdash;consider the case of a deleted file.
</p><p>
Because flags such as IN_ISDIR are present in the bitmask,
it never should be compared to a possible event directly. Instead,
the bits should be tested individually. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (event-&gt;mask &amp; IN_DELETE) {
        if (event-&gt;mask &amp; IN_ISDIR)
                printf ("Directory deleted!\n");
        else
                printf ("File deleted!\n");
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf95f0"></a>
Modifying Watches</h2></div></div><p>
A watch is modified by calling inotify_add_watch() with an updated
event mask. If the watch already exists, the mask is simply updated and
the original watch descriptor is returned.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbf96f8"></a>
Removing Watches</h2></div></div><p>
Watches are removed with the inotify_rm_watch() system call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int inotify_rm_watch (int fd, int wd);
</pre>
</p><p>
A call to inotify_rm_watch() removes the watch associated
with the watch descriptor wd from the inotify instance associated
with the file descriptor fd. The call returns zero on success
and negative one on failure, in which case errno is set as
appropriate.
</p><p>
Usage, as usual, is simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int ret;

ret = inotify_rm_watch (fd, wd);
if (ret)
        perror ("inotify_rm_watch");

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0dbf0"></a>
Shutting inotify Down</h2></div></div><p>
To destroy any existing watches, pending events
and the inotify instance itself, invoke the
close() system call on the inotify instance's
file descriptor. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int ret;

ret = close (fd);
if (ret)
        perror ("close");

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0dd50"></a>
One-Shot Support</h2></div></div><p>
If the IN_ONESHOT value is OR'ed into the event mask at watch
addition, the watch is atomically removed during generation of the
first event. Subsequent events will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be generated against the
file until the watch is added back. This behavior is desired by some
applications, for example, Samba, where one-shot support mimics the
behavior of the file change notification system on Microsoft Windows.
</p><p>
Usage is, naturally, simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int wd;

wd = inotify_add_watch (fd,
                "/home/rlove/Desktop",
                IN_MODIFY | IN_ONESHOT);

if (wd &lt; 0)
        perror ("inotify_add_watch");

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0df60"></a>
On Unmount</h2></div></div><p>
One of the biggest issues with dnotify (aside from the signals and
basically everything else) is that a dnotify watch on a directory requires
that said directory remain open. Consequently, watching a directory on,
say, a USB keychain drive prevents the drive from unmounting. inotify
solves this problem by not requiring that any file be open.
</p><p>
inotify takes this one step further, though, and sends out the
IN_UNMOUNT event when the filesystem on which a file resides is
unmounted. It also automatically destroys the watch and cleanup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0e0c0"></a>
Moves</h2></div></div><p>
Move events are complicated because inotify may be watching the directory
that the file is moved to or from, but not the other. Because of this,
it is not always possible to alert the user of the source
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
destination of a file involved in a move. inotify is able to alert
the application to both only if the application is watching both directories.
</p><p>
In that case, inotify emits an IN_MOVED_FROM from the watch
descriptor of the source directory, and it emits an IN_MOVED_TO
from the watch descriptor of the destination directory. If
watching only one or the other, only the one event will be sent.
</p><p>
To tie together two disparate moved to/from events, inotify sets the
cookie field in the inotify_event structure to a unique
nonzero value. Two events with matching cookies are thus related, one
showing the source and one showing the destination of the move.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0e2d0"></a>
Obtaining the Size of the Queue</h2></div></div><p>
The size of the pending event queue can be obtained via FIONREAD:

<pre     class="programlisting">

unsigned int queue_len;
int ret;

ret = ioctl (fd, FIONREAD, &amp;queue_len);
if (ret &lt; 0)
        perror ("ioctl");
else
        printf ("%u bytes pending in queue\n", queue_len);

</pre>
</p><p>
This is useful to implement throttling: reading from the queue only when
the number of events has grown sufficiently large.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0e488"></a>
Configuring inotify</h2></div></div><p>
inotify is configurable via procfs and sysctl.
</p><p>
/proc/sys/filesystem/inotify/max_queued_events is the maximum number
of events that can be queued at once. If the queue reaches this size,
new events are dropped, but the IN_Q_OVERFLOW event is always
sent. With a significantly large queue, overflows are rare even if
watching many objects. The default value is 16,384 events per queue.
</p><p>
/proc/sys/filesystem/inotify/max_user_instances is the maximum
number of inotify instances that a given user can instantiate. The
default value is 128 instances, per user.
</p><p>
/proc/sys/filesystem/inotify/max_user_watches is the maximum number
of watches per instance. The default value is 8,192 watches, per instance.
</p><p>
These knobs exist because kernel memory is a precious resource. Although
any user can read these files, only the system administrator can write
to them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xf0e6f0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
