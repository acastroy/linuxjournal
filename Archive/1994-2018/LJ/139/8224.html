See how Linux can be used to prototype
a sophisticated Internet appliance.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b768"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A phrase we heard many times when we
sought venture capital to develop the Internet
appliance we call Radii was &ldquo;If this were 1999, you would already have
your money.&rdquo; Unfortunately, it was 2004
and there was no money for a risky consumer product
such as Radii, despite our compelling prototype and a
well-defined market. Rather than let our efforts go
to waste, we decided to share the details of the
prototype here with the Linux community that made
its development possible. In this article, we explain
how we quickly built our Radii prototype using low-cost
hardware and Linux along with some of its
companion software, including Perl and GCC.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8224f1.large.jpg"><img src="8224f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Radii&mdash;a 1950s-style radio with Internet content.
</p></div></div><p>
Radii is a radio: a box with buttons and dials
used to select bands and tune stations in a familiar
way. Because this radio receives Internet radio, it
provides hundreds of noise-free stations with a wide
variety of listening options. The band selection
dial, instead of AM and FM, is used to select genres
such as News, Sports and Rock. The station
selection dial scrolls through station
names that can be tuned by clicking the select
button.
</p><p>
At the beginning of this project, the three of us
threw in $100 each and some spare time while
continuing to work our day jobs. We never thought of
this as an exercise in rapid prototyping; it was all
about implementing our vision as quickly and
inexpensively as possible. At every step of our
development, we looked for the fastest way to get the
task accomplished and balanced that against its
cost.
</p><p>
The prototype is housed in a converted SW-54 radio
made by the National Radio Company in the 1950s.
The radio was in poor condition before the
conversion. As admirers and collectors of old
technology, we like to think we gave it a new lease
on life.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249bb88"></a>
Hardware Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The Radii core hardware platform is an old laptop
running Linux. The operator interface consists of
two rotary encoders, three momentary contact
buttons, a 40x2 backlit LCD, a power supply and a
retro radio cabinet. The encoders and buttons are
connected to a PIC microcontroller development
board that is, in turn, connected to the laptop's
serial port. The LCD is connected to the laptop's
parallel port.
</p><p>
On our budget of $300, cost was important. As such,
eBay was our vendor of choice. Here is our hardware
shopping list:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
PIC microcontroller dev board (OOPIC) ($70).
</p></li><li><p>
One TTL to RS-232 chip (TI MAX232) and associated
bits to interface the PIC to RS-232 ($5).
</p></li><li><p>
Three momentary buttons for selection/special
functions ($3).
</p></li><li><p>
Two rotary encoders one for band selection, one
for stations selection ($3).
</p></li><li><p>
One 40x2 LED backlit LCD ($12 eBay).
</p></li><li><p>
Gateway Solo 5150, 300MHz Pentium laptop, broken
screen ($100 eBay).
</p></li><li><p>
One National NC-54 vintage radio ($35 eBay).
</p></li><li><p>
Power supply for PIC and LCD (3/$10 eBay).
</p></li><li><p>
Cables, connectors, bubble gum, baling wire and so on. ($25).
</p></li><li><p>
Shipping, fees and taxes took up most of the
remaining funds.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
A PIC microcontroller is a single-chip computer
produced by Microchip Technology, Inc. Although these
tiny computers are capable of many useful things,
we used it here simply to handle operator inputs. For
prototyping with a PIC, a development board
normally is used. PIC development boards provide an
easy way to prototype a PIC application by allowing
a range of input power options and easy access to
the input and output pins for the chip. It is not
necessary to use this, but it makes creating a
prototype easier.
</p><p>
We used the OOPIC development board/system by Savage
Innovations. It is inexpensive and provides a simple
object interface for many input and output devices,
including buttons, encoders and RS-232 serial
communication. Unfortunately, there is no Linux
development environment for OOPIC, although a
SourceForge project is underway.
</p><p>
The hardware is rounded out with a Gateway Solo
5150 laptop that has a broken LCD. Similar
laptops go for between $50 and $100 on eBay.

The Operating System</h2></div></div><p>
We chose Linux from the start for many reasons. The
primary reason is that most distributions are
configured with many of the tools we thought we
might use, such as mpg123, XMMS, Perl and compilers. It
also helped us stay on budget because it's free.
Linux makes prototyping easy, because many
applications and utilities have retained their
command-line interface, allowing their use from
scripts, such as the one written for Radii and
described below.
</p><p>
Installation and configuration of the OS was
straightforward, except for audio support. Because
our laptop was so old, most installers were not able
to detect the audio hardware. In an unscientific
way, we tried many different Linux distributions
until we found one that installed easily on our
machine. We wound up installing Fedora Core 2 with
ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) support.
</p><p>
To get sound working for your particular machine,
it is most important to identify your sound
hardware. In our case, we were able to determine
the sound hardware by Googling on the model number
for this laptop. Once we determined which sound
hardware we had, we were able to locate and install
the appropriate ALSA driver for our machine,
the ES1879 ESS Audio Driver, from the ALSA Project site.
You may need to tweak some of the default ALSA
parameters by using the alsamixer utility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249c898"></a>
Software Components</h2></div></div><p>
With the hardware in place and the OS working, it
all came down to finding or creating the required
software components. We had simple requirements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
An audio stream player.
</p></li><li><p>
An LCD controller.
</p></li><li><p>
An application to process operator-induced signals
from the serial port and interact with the stream
player and LCD.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249cc08"></a>
The Audio Stream Player</h2></div></div><p>
We needed a way to play streaming audio that we
could control from our application. We initially
dismissed XMMS because it is a GUI application,
but we later re-examined it and discovered that
XMMS can be manipulated from the command line.
</p><p>
The XMMS application provides many handy options
that can be used to control an already-running
instance of itself. It can be stopped by issuing
the -s argument. The playlist can be updated
by using <tt  >-p &lt;playlist&gt;</tt> and the playlist
argument can be the URL of a stream. Use <tt  >xmms -h</tt>
for complete details.
</p><p>
For example, you ask XMMS to switch from its current
selection to the AM 1710 Antioch Internet station
(old-time radio), by issuing the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xmms -p http://66.54.65.226:9022
</pre>
</p><p>
To stop, use <tt  >xmms -s</tt> and so on.
</p><p>
XMMS completely covered our needs for a player, but it
introduced a problem as well. XMMS is a GUI application, so it
requires a running X11 server. Rather than tax the available resources
on our low-powered laptop, we used the X Virtual Frame Buffer,
Xvfb. Xvfb provides a lightweight X11 server that
can be used to provide X11 resources to applications
that require them, but it does nothing else&mdash; it is
invisible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x2493860"></a>
The LCD Controller</h2></div></div><p>
We required a CLI application that would display a
string on our parallel port LCD. After Googling for
this, we found a FOSS application called lcd-info.
lcd-info displays system performance information on
an HD44780-compatible LCD connected to the system
parallel port. It was not quite what we needed, but after
studying its source for a few minutes, we found that
it could be adapted easily for our purpose.
</p><p>
lcd-info is written in C and compiles into a CLI
application. We compile our simpler application with
a trivial invocation of GCC:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% gcc -o setlcd setlcd.c iolcd.c
</pre>
</p><p>
The low-level routines that control the LCD are in
iolcd.c, which was borrowed without modification from
the lcd-info Project. setlcd.c is the Radii-specific
piece that uses functions found in iolcd.c. We
called our binary setlcd, and it is run like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">

% setlcd &lt;string to display&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Building the cable to interface the LCD to the
parallel port was more time consuming than was adapting
lcd-info. It seems that there should be an
appropriate off-the-shelf cable, but the pinout on
the LCD-side of the cable varies with the
manufacturer/model. Rather than finding exactly the
right cable/LCD pair, we elected to make our own
cable for the LCD we had acquired based on price.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x2493b20"></a>
The Radii Application</h2></div></div><p>
We built the Radii application using Perl. We chose
Perl because it's a language we know well, it has many
supporting packages and the update/compile/debug cycle is fast.
</p><p>
The first thing to do is read the input from the PIC
development board connected to the serial port. We
used the Device::SerialPort package. Here is the
beginning of our application, which shows how to
initialize the serial port using the
Device::SerialPort module:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Device::SerialPort;

use strict;

# Set up the port.
# All port settings must match the PIC settings.
my $port = new Device::SerialPort("/dev/ttyS0");
$port-&gt;baudrate(9600);
$port-&gt;parity("none");
$port-&gt;databits(8);
$port-&gt;stopbits(1);
$port-&gt;handshake('none');
$port-&gt;write_settings;
</pre>
</p><p>
Then we needed to handle the following messages sent
from the PIC development board based on user input:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Msg Meaning
--- -------
U   The station encoder rotated one unit up
D   The station encoder rotated one unit down
s   The select button was pressed
u   The band encoder rotated one unit up
d   The band encoder rotated one unit down

while ( 1 )
{
  while (! ($code = $port-&gt;input))
  {
     select undef, undef, undef, 0.075;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The outer while loop keeps the application running
until it is killed or dies. The inner while loop
attempts to read from the serial port. If there is
nothing to read, it sleeps for a short time, 0.075
seconds, and then tries again. This sleep is important
to keep the application from spinning too hard and
consuming a lot of CPU time. Any messages that
arrive while the loop is sleeping accumulate on the
port and are available the next time we read.
</p><p>
When an input message is received, the application
always should respond by updating the LCD. It sometimes should
respond by changing the current station, that is, when the selection button is pressed.
</p><p>
When we get a Station Up (U) or Station Down (D)
message, we need to display the next station on the
LCD, but we don't want the station to change until
the user sends a select signal. This brings us to
the LCD message display. As previously noted, we
use the setlcd command, but now we call it from the
Perl script using the Perl system command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
system("setlcd",
       "Sel:$radiiStn{$curBand}{$choice}{name}");
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x2493ee8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where $radiiStn{$curBand}{$choice}{name} is a hash
that is indexed by way of the band index and the choice
index. It contains the necessary selection
information: display name (used here), station URL
and its band.
</p><p>
Once the operator clicks the select button, the PIC
sends an s message. In response, the system
updates the LCD to the new station name and
signals XMMS to play the new stream, again using
Perl's system command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
system("setlcd",
       $radiiStn{$curBand}{$choice}{name});
system("/usr/bin/xmms",
       "-p",
       $radiiStn{$curBand}{$choice}{station});
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x24940a0"></a>
Configuration Using XML</h2></div></div><p>
The Radii application is configured using a simple
XML input file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;Radii&gt;
  &lt;station url="http://66.54.65.226:9022"&gt;
    &lt;band&gt;OLD TIME RADIO&lt;/band&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;AM 1710 Antioch&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/station&gt;
  &lt;station url="http://205.188.234.38:8040"&gt;
    &lt;band&gt;Celtic&lt;/band&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;CelticGrove.com 24/7 Celtic/Irish&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/station&gt;
  .
  .
  .
&lt;/Radii&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The XML configuration file can be read using the
XML::Simple Perl module.

<pre     class="programlisting">
my @station;
my %radiiStn = ();
my %bands = ();

my $file = 'stations.xml';
my $xs1 = XML::Simple-&gt;new();
my $doc = $xs1-&gt;XMLin($file);

foreach my $key (keys (%{$doc-&gt;{station}}))
{
    $band = $doc-&gt;{station}{$key}{band};
    $url  = $doc-&gt;{station}{$key}{url};
    $name = $key;
    $bands{$band} += 1;
    $radiiStn{$band}{$bands{$band}}{name} =
       $bands{$band}.":$band: ".$key;
    $radiiStn{$band}{$bands{$band}}{station} = $url;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This code utilizes Perl hashes for the required band
and station information. Band information, including name and
number of stations, is kept in the bands hash.
Station information, such as name, URL and band, is kept in
radiiStn hash.
</p><p>
See the on-line Resources for the URL of a site
with the complete script and other associated
software, along with details on how to build the
hardware.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Radii demonstrates how Linux can be used to
prototype a complex consumer device quickly and
cheaply. As the iPod revolution takes hold and
satellite radio becomes more popular, Radii-like
devices inevitably will change the way radio is
broadcast and received all over the world.
</p><p>
Rapid prototyping does not require particular
hardware, sets of tools or languages. It's not about
finding the best solution; it's about getting it
done quickly using the available resources. That
pool of resources is vast when it is FOSS on Linux.
Keep your eye on the goal while you sort through
the potential building blocks. Tweak as necessary,
and then glue it all together with your language of
choice.
</p><p>
We configured our laptop to boot to run-level 3, full multiuser mode.
After the laptop boots, we start Xvfb, set our DISPLAY variable, start XMMS
and start the Radii application. The startup
sequence is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

% Xvfb :1 &amp;
% export DISPLAY=:1.0
% xmms &amp;
% radii.pl

</pre>
</p><p>
Then we hide the laptop and enjoy the radio that we
call Radii.
