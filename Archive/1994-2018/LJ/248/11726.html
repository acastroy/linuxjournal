Build a Raspberry Pi-based Kismet sensor network to hunt rouge wireless
access points.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x23181f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Years ago, I worked for an automotive IT provider, and occasionally we went
out to the plants to search for rogue Wireless Access Points (WAPs). A
rogue WAP is one that the company hasn't approved to be there. So if
someone were to go and buy a wireless router, and plug it in to the
network, that would be a rogue WAP. A rogue WAP also could be someone
using a cell phone or MiFi as a Wi-Fi hotspot.
</p><p>
The tools we used were laptops with Fluke Networks' AirMagnet, at
the time a proprietary external Wi-Fi card and the software dashboard. The
equipment required us to walk around the plants&mdash;and that is never safe
due to the product lines, autonomous robots, parts trucks, HiLos, noise,
roof access and so on. Also when IT people are walking around with laptops,
employees on site will take notice. We became known, and the people with
the rogue WAPs would turn them off before we could find the devices.
</p><p>
The payment card industry, with its data security standard (PCI-DSS),
is the only one I could find that requires companies to do
quarterly scans for rogue WAPs. Personally, I have three big problems
with occasional scanning. One, as I said before, rogue WAPs get turned off
during scans and turned back on after. Two, the scans are just snapshots
in time. A snapshot doesn't show what the day-to-day environment looks
like, and potential problems are missed. Third, I think there is more value
for every company to do the scans, regardless of whether they're required.
</p><p>
Later, when I was a network engineer at a publishing company, I found it
was good to know what was on my employer's network. The company
wanted to know if employees followed policy. The company also was worried
about data loss, especially around a couple projects. Other
companies near us had set up their own wireless networks that caused
interference with the ones we ran. Finally, I had to worry about penetration
testers using tools like the WiFi Pineapple and the Pwn Plug. These
allow network access over Wi-Fi beyond the company's physical perimeter.
</p><p>
One thing I always wanted was a passive real-time wireless sensor
network to watch for changes in Wi-Fi. A passive system, like Kismet
and Airodump-NG, collects all the packets in the radio frequency (RF)
that the card can detect and displays them. This finds hidden WAPs too, by
looking at the clients talking to them. In contrast, active systems, like
the old Netsumbler, try to connect WAPs by broadcasting null SSID probes
and displaying the WAPs that reply back. This misses hidden networks.
</p><p>
A couple years ago, I decided to go back to school to get a Bachelor's
degree. I needed to find a single credit hour to fill for graduation. That
one credit hour became an independent study on using the Raspberry Pi
(RPi) to create a passive real-time wireless sensor network.
</p><p>
About the same time I left the automotive job, Larry Pesce of the SANS
Institute wrote &ldquo;Discovering Rogue Wireless Access Points Using Kismet
and Disposable Hardware&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.giac.org/paper/gawn/7/discovering-rogue-wireless-access-points-kismet-disposable-hardware/107273" target="_self">www.giac.org/paper/gawn/7/discovering-rogue-wireless-access-points-kismet-disposable-hardware/107273</a>). This was a paper about real-time wireless
sensors using the Linksys WRT54GL router and OpenWRT. But, I didn't find
out about that until I had already re-invented the wheel with the RPi.
</p><p>
Today lots of wireless intrusion detection systems exist on the
market, but as listed in the Hardware sidebar,
mine cost me little more than $400.00 USD to make. Based on numbers I could
get, via Google Shopping, using Cisco Network's Wireless IDS data sheet
from 2014, a similar set up would have cost about $11,500 USD. I've
been told by a wireless engineer I know that he was quoted about twice that
for just one piece of hardware from the Cisco design.

When I started looking into using the RPi for this, I kept coming
across people using the RPi and Kismet for war driving, war walking
and war biking. David Bryan of Trustwave's Spider Labs did a blog post
in 2012 called &ldquo;Wardrive, Raspberry Pi Style!&rdquo;
(<a href="http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2012/12/wardrive-raspberry-pi-style.html" target="_self">blog.spiderlabs.com/2012/12/wardrive-raspberry-pi-style.html</a>) where he talked about
using Kismet with the RPi to track WAPs on his walk and drive around his
area. He used a USB GPS device to map out where the access points were.
</p><p>
Because the RPis are used as stationary devices,
I didn't need
GPS. One thing I did need though was a rough idea of where to place
the sensors. Based on readings, Wi-Fi is good for about 328 feet (100
meters) with the omnidirectional antenna being used on the TP-Link
card indoors. Having the existing wireless survey (or doing one) will
be useful (see Wireless Survey sidebar). It will let you know where the
existing WAPs are. This information also could come from the network
documentation, if it exists. It is important to keep the detectors from
being overpowered by approved access points. The wireless survey or
network documentation also should provide the BSSIDs for the approved
devices to be filtered out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x2319488"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Wireless Survey</b></p><p>
A wireless survey is usually a map of a building or location showing 
the signal strengths associated with wireless access points. Surveys are
usually the first step when a new wireless network is installed. Surveys
give the installers how many WAPs are needed, where they should be
spaced, and what channels would be best to use in those areas.
</p><p>
Surveys normally are done with a WAP and a Wi-Fi-enabled device. The WAP 
is placed in a location, and signal strength is recorded as the client
is moved around the area.
</p><p>
A rogue WAP or a survey WAP can be built from a Raspberry Pi 
with a wireless card and Hostapd. Most on-line documentation for a Hostapd
WAP says to bridge the network cards on the RPi. This can be skipped
if the WAP will not be used with clients that connect to the Internet.
</p></div><p>
The RPis have no shortage of operating systems to run. My
choice for this project was to run Kali Linux 
on the RPi, with Airodump-NG and Kismet. Originally, it was going to be
just Kali and Kismet, but
I ran into some limitations. The reason I chose Kali for this project,
was the hardware drivers for the network card I used didn't need to
be recompiled. Kali also came with Airodump-NG preinstalled, and an
<tt  >apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install kismet</tt> took care of
installing the rest of what I needed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x23197f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Kali Linux:</b></p><p>
Kali Linux is the new version of Backtrack Linux&mdash;one of the specialized 
Linux distributions for penetration testing and security. It is currently 
based off Debian Linux, with security-focused tools preinstalled. Kali
runs everything via the root login.
</p><p>
Kali has builds available as ISOs and VMware images in 64-bit, 32-bit
and custom-built ARM images for single card boards, Chrome OS and Android
OS devices.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x2319a60"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Airodump-NG</b></p><p>
Airodump is a raw 802.11 packet capture device. It is part of the 
Aircrack-NG suite. Normally, Airodump-NG will capture a file of packets
to be cracked by Aircrack-NG. However, in my case, I wanted the feature
where Airodump-NG can list the clients and access points it sees around
it, which is about 300 feet indoors (this distance is based on documentation
by the 802.11 standard).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x2319c70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is Kismet?</b></p><p>
Kismet is an 802.11 wireless network detector, sniffer and intrusion 
detection system. Kismet will work with any wireless card that supports
raw
monitoring mode, and it can sniff 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g and 802.11n
traffic
(devices and drivers permitting).
</p><p>
Kismet also sports a plugin architecture allowing for additional
non-802.11 
protocols to be decoded.
</p><p>
Kismet identifies networks by passively collecting packets and detecting 
networks, which allows it to detect (and given time, expose the names of)
hidden networks and the presence of non-beaconing networks via data
traffic.
</p></div><p>
Kismet has two modes that can be run. The first is the Kismet
Server, which the Kismet User Interface (Kismet UI) connects to (Figure 1).
The Kismet UI shows the WAP name, if is an access
point or not, encrypted or not, the channel and other information. The
&ldquo;seen by&rdquo; column is the list of capture sources that saw the WAPs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11726f1.large.jpg"><img src="11726f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Kismet Network List
</p></div></div><p>
Kismet calls the remote sensors drones. They're
configured through the kismet drone configuration file in
/etc/kismet/kismet_drone.conf. I found the
documentation for setting up this part rather sparse. Everything I found
spanned multiple years and didn't go into too much detail.
</p><p>
When I configured my drones, I set one up first and then cloned the
SD card with the <tt  >dd</tt> command. I copied the cloned image to the other SD
cards, again using <tt  >dd</tt>. To speed up
<tt  >dd</tt>, set the block size to about half
the computer's memory.
</p><p>
Making the drones this way did cause a problem with the wireless network
cards. Use <tt  >ifconfig</tt> to see what cards the system
lists. As you can see from the screenshot shown in Figure 2, my drone02
has the wireless card listed as wlan1, and it is already in monitor
mode. After the drives were all cloned, I just had to go in and make
minor configuration changes&mdash;besides the wireless card change.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11726f2.large.jpg"><img src="11726f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. iconfig Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>
The Raspberry Pi uses about 750 mAh, and a 5-volt 1-amp power supply
doesn't put enough power out to start the wireless card after the
Raspberry Pi is booted. Many of the forums I read said that you need
something that puts out 1.5&ndash;2.1 amps. I found that plugging in the card
first prevents the extra draw, and I didn't have a problem.
</p><p>
In the steps below, if you plug in the Wi-Fi card after booting, you risk
a power drop to the Raspberry Pi. The loss of power will crash the RPi,
and the SD card could be corrupted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x27128b8"></a>
Configuring the Raspberry Pi with Kali</h2></div></div><p>
First, download the Kali Raspberry Pi distro from the Kali Linux Web site.
</p><p>
Copy the image to the SD card with the <tt  >dd</tt> command or a tool like
Win32DiskImage in Windows. This creates a bit-for-bit copy of the image
on the SD card. It is similar to burning an ISO to a DVD or CD.
</p><p>
Put the SD card into the RPi.
Then, attach the Wi-Fi card you're using to a USB port.
</p><p>
Attach a Cat5, Cat5e or Cat6 cable to the Ethernet port. Wired is used
to communicate data to the network to prevent problems with the wireless
card in monitor mode.
</p><p>
Plug in the micro USB cable to turn on the RPi.
Next, <tt  >ssh</tt> to the device. You may need to do a port scan with nmap to find the
RPi. Alternatively, you can use a monitor and keyboard to 
access the console directly. Again, have all peripherals plugged in prior to
plugging in the power.
</p><p>
The login is &ldquo;root&rdquo;, and the password is
&ldquo;toor&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x2712cd8"></a>
Configure the Kismet Drone</h2></div></div><p>
Configure eth0 with a static IP address like in the static
IP address screenshot (Figure 3). This is done under
/etc/network/interfaces.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11726f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Static IP Address Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>
Restart the networking with <tt  >service networking restart</tt>
or <tt  >reboot</tt>. If you connected via SSH, you'll have
to reconnect.
</p><p>
Next, edit /etc/kismet/kismet_drone.conf. I have
included a screenshot (Figure 4), but below are settings I used,
and the fields that need to be changed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11726f4.large.jpg"><img src="11726f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. drone.conf
</p></div></div><p>
Set the following either to something that makes sense to you or
the right information for your network and device. I used what I have
configured for the examples.
</p><p>
Name the drone with <tt  >servername</tt>. This will show up in the bottom of the
Kismet UI and logs when connecting.
</p><p>
Use <tt  >dronelisten</tt> to set the protocol, interface's IP address and port
for the drone is to listen on for servers' connection.
</p><p>
List what servers can talk to this drone with
<tt  >allowedhosts</tt>. This can
be a whole network using CIDR notation or just individual boxes on the
network, and also allow the drone to talk to itself with
<tt  >droneallowedhosts</tt>.
</p><p>
Set the maximum number of servers that can talk to the drone with
<tt  >dronemaxclients</tt>.
</p><p>
Set the max backlog of packets for the kismet drone with
<tt  >droneringlen</tt>. Smaller than what I have might be better. I had problems
with drone04 crashing. It also was the one that saw the most networks.
</p><p>
Turn off GPS with <tt  >gps=false</tt>. You don't need it since these are stationary
devices and you should know where they are.
</p><p>
Set the capture source, <tt  >ncsource</tt>. This tells the system what interface
to use and driver to use for that card:

<pre     class="programlisting">
servername=Kismet-Drone-pi2
dronelisten=tcp://192.168.1.12:2502
allowedhosts=192.168.1.65
droneallowedhosts==127.0.0.1
dronemaxclients=10
droneringlen=65535
gps=false
ncsource=wlan1:type=ath5k
</pre>
</p><p>
The rest of the options I left set to default. Unless you're in a
country that uses more B/G channels than the US, there is nothing that
needs to be modified.
</p><p>
The last thing to configure on the drones is the
/etc/rc.local file. This will start the kismet
drone program in the background when the RPi powers on. Add these two
lines before the <tt  >exit 0</tt> so yours looks like the
code below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# start kistmet
 /usr/bin/kismet_drone --daemonize

exit 0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2220580.0x27139e8"></a>
Configure the Kismet Server on a PC or Server for the Drone Sensors</h2></div></div><p>
There are two settings to change in
/etc/kismet/kismet.conf. The first is in the
<tt  >ncsource</tt>. The second is the
<tt  >filter_tracking</tt>.
</p><p>
The line below and related screen capture (Figure 5)
tell Kismet what its capture sources are. In this case, nothing local
is being used, just the drones. Repeat this line for each drone, with
the proper information:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ncsource=drone:host=192.168.1.12,port=2502,name=i2
</pre>
</p><p>
The line says the source is a drone, the drone's IP address, what
port to connect to on the drone, and what the drone should show as in
the Kismet UI. The name is seen &ldquo;network list&rdquo; view and
&ldquo;network
detail&rdquo; view. I went with the two-character name of
&ldquo;i#&rdquo; because the
&ldquo;Last Seen By&rdquo; field in the network list has a hard-coded limit of
ten characters. I wanted that field to show as many drones as it could.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11726f5.large.jpg"><img src="11726f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Kismet Server Sources
</p></div></div><p>
Next, filter out the known network BSSIDs. Previously, I mentioned that a
wireless survey or network documentation should be able to provide this
information. As you can see in the network list screenshot, 
several devices are listed. If you have devices you don't want to see,
you'll need to filter them out in the Kismet Server configuration file
/etc/kismet/kismet.conf.
</p><p>
In the configuration file, it has an example of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
filter_tracker=ANY(!"00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF")
</pre>
</p><p>
In my version of Kismet, that did not work. I had to remove the quotes so
the line looked like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
filter_tracker=BSSID(!00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF)
</pre>
</p><p>
The bang (!) ignores that MAC address. This shows everything but ignored
WAPs. Without the bang (!), Kismet would show only the WAP with that BSSID
in the network list. The choices are ANY, BSSID, SOURCE and DEST. Although the
documentation says you can use ANY with a bang (!),
trying it fails. The
error said to use one of the other three options. The MAC address can be
stacked using a comma-separated list:


<pre     class="programlisting">
filter_tracker=BSSID(!00:00:DE:AD:BE:EF,!00:0:DE:AD:BE:EE,
&#8618;!00:00:DE:AD:BE:ED)
</pre>
</p><p>
With the Drone Sensor Network running, the network detail screen for an
access point will show which drones see the WAP (Figure 6).
But, this is a limitation of the system. This screen provides only the
signal strength for the drone with the strongest signal. This was the
limit of Mr Pesce's WRT54GL option.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11726f6.large.jpg"><img src="11726f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Network Detail Screen
</p></div></div><p>
In Mr Pesce's model, once the rogue WAP was detected, someone had to
go out and search. The search area was around all the drones that saw
the rouge WAP. Although his design makes the search area smaller than a
whole building, it doesn't triangulate very well. By using the RPis
as drones, there is a second program you can use for triangulation.
</p><p>
Airodump-NG, as I mentioned before, is for capturing packets on
over Wi-Fi. The user interface, when running Airodump-NG, provides
several bits of information. The ones you want are BSSID, PWR (power
measured in negative DB), Channel and ESSID (Figures 7&ndash;9: each image shows a different
power level, which when used with the Roosevelt picture, shows how to
use it for triangulation).

</p></div></div><p>
<tt  >ssh</tt> to each RPi drone, and run this command. Don't forget to replace
the <tt  >bssid</tt> with the MAC address of the WAP you are looking for and the
interface for what that drone is monitoring with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

airodump-ng --bssid &lt;MAC ADDRESS&gt; &lt;interface&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Note: I did not use the channel command in the above line to lock a
channel. This would interfere with data going back to the Kismet Server
and lose the device if the WAP is configured for channel hopping.

Proof of Concept</h2></div></div><p>
I did my proof of concept at Eastern Michigan University's Roosevelt
Hall, which is where my degree program's labs are. In the map of
Roosevelt Hall (Figure 10), there are three drones. This was due
to power and Ethernet cable limitations. There is also a rogue WAP
(rogue_ap_pi), hidden by my professor. Kismet showed me all the networks
in the area, because I didn't have BSSIDs to filter them out. Again,
this is where having network documentation or a wireless survey would
be helpful.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11726f10.large.jpg"><img src="11726f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Map of Roosevelt Hall at Eastern Michigan University (Google
Maps)
</p></div></div><p>
Drone3 and drone4 are in a hallway. Drone2 is in one of the lab rooms,
with the Linksys network and my laptop running the Kismet Server and
Kismet UI. When drone4 was just inside the lab's door, there was a 10DB signal loss. Again, a wireless survey would have helped, because it
would show how much signal the walls blocked.
</p><p>
Once I had the system up and running and the drones where I wanted them,
my professor hid the rogue WAP somewhere on the same floor. By looking
at the power levels, I was able to figure out where to go to find the
rouge WAP. I knew that drone4 was the closest and that the rogue WAP was
on the other side of that drone. I walked down that hallway and found the
rogue WAP in less than two minutes. It was hidden under a bench in the hall,
outside a classroom and the other lab.

Limitations of the Wi-Fi Card</h2></div></div><p>
The last limitation I want to cover is the TP-Link TL-WN722N card. I
went with this card because of the cost, the external antenna, the
power draw when plugged in to the RPi and its availability at a
local store. The card can talk only on the 2.4GHz range,
meaning that it picks up only 802.11 B, G and N networks. It does not
have the ability to detect or use the 5GHz range used by parts of N, A
or the new AC networks.
</p><p>
Although I have a couple ALFA wireless cards, and one that should be
able to detect A and AC, I do not know if I could run them on the RPi
drone without a separate powered USB hub.
</p><p>
This setup also does not detect Zigbee/Xbee or Bluetooth. Xbee uses
both 900MHz and 2.4GHz. Bluetooth uses 2.4GHz. Although both
devices use 2.4GHz, frequencies (channels) are outside the Wi-Fi
card's range. Mike Kershaw (aka Dragorn, Kismet's developer)
is working on a hardware and software Xbee detector called kisbee. An
Ubertooth One should work with Kismet to detect Bluetooth.
</p><p>
Cell phones and related cellular network cards also would be missed. Phones
operate outside the Wi-Fi card's range, unless the phone is a Wi-Fi
hotspot. The new HackRF One card might be able to detect the cellular
networks, as well as A/B/G/N/AC Wi-Fi, Xbee and Bluetooth, but I haven't
gotten one to play with, and they would drive up the cost to about $300
USD per sensor.
