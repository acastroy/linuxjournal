doing a &ldquo;deep dive&rdquo; into the usability of the GNOME desktop.

I work at a university, and one of our faculty members often repeats to me,
&ldquo;Software needs to be like a rock; it needs to be that easy to
use.&rdquo; And,
she's right. Because if software is too hard to use, no one will want
to use it.
</p><p>
I recently spoke at GUADEC, the GNOME Users And Developers European
Conference, and I opened my presentation with a reminder that GNOME is
competing for mind share with other systems that are fairly easy for
most people to use: Mac, iPad, Windows and Chromebook. So for GNOME
to continue to be successful, it needs to be easy for everyone to
use&mdash;experts and newcomers alike. And, that's where usability comes in.
</p><p>
So, what is usability? Usability is about the users. Users often
are busy people who are trying to get things done. They use programs to be
productive, so the users decide when a program is easy to use. Generally,
a program has good usability if it is easy for new users to learn,
easy for them to use, and easy for them to remember when they use the
program again.
</p><p>
In a more practical view, average users with typical knowledge should be
able to use the software to perform real tasks. The purpose of usability
testing, therefore, is to uncover issues that prevent general users
from employing the software successfully. As such, usability testing
differs from quality assurance testing or unit testing, the purpose of
which is to uncover errors in the program. Usability testing is not a
functional evaluation of the program's features, but rather a practical
determination of the program's operability.
</p><p>
Usability testing does not rely on a single method. There are multiple
approaches to implement usability practices, from interviews and focus
groups to formal usability testing. Whatever method you use, the value of
usability testing lies in performing the evaluation during development,
not after the program enters functional testing when user interface
changes become more difficult to implement. In open-source software
development, the community of developers must apply usability testing
iteratively throughout development. Developers do not require extensive
usability experience to apply these usability practices in open-source
software.
</p><p>
I prefer the formal usability test, and it's not hard. You can gain
significant insight just by gathering a few testers and watching them use
the software. With each iteration, usability testing identifies a number
of issues to resolve and uncovers additional issues that, when addressed,
will further improve the program's ease of use. Usability cannot be
addressed only at the end of a software development lifecycle. If you
wait until the end, it is usually too late to make changes.

How to Run a Usability Test&mdash;Usability Testing in GNOME</h2></div></div><p>
I recently worked with the GNOME Design Team to examine the usability of
GNOME. This was an opportune moment to do usability testing in GNOME.
The project was in the process of updating the GNOME design patterns:
the gear menu, the application menu, selection mode and search, just to list a
few. I assembled a usability test to understand how well users understand
and navigate the new design patterns in GNOME. Here is how I did that.
</p><p>
The first step in planning a usability test is to understand
the users. Who are they, and what tasks do they typically want to
perform? With GNOME, that answer was easy. The GNOME Web site explains
that &ldquo;GNOME 3 is an easy and elegant way to use your computer. It is
designed to put you in control and bring freedom to everybody.&rdquo; GNOME
is for everyone, of all ages, for casual users and software developers.
</p><p>
From there, I worked with the GNOME Design Team to build a usability
test for these users. The test also needed to exercise the GNOME design
patterns. I compared the design patterns used by each GNOME program and
decided five GNOME applications provided a reasonable representation of
the design patterns:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
gedit (text editor)
</p></li><li><p>
Web (Web browser)
</p></li><li><p>
Nautilus (file manager)
</p></li><li><p>
Software (similar to an app store)
</p></li><li><p>
Notes (a simple note-taking program)
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Having decided on the programs, I wove a set of test scenarios that
exercised the design patterns around tasks that real people would likely
do. Designing the test scenarios is an important part of any usability
test. You need to be very careful in the wording. It is too easy to
&ldquo;give away&rdquo; accidentally how to do something just by using a particular
turn of phrase. For example, one of my scenarios for Web asked testers to
&ldquo;Please make the text bigger&rdquo; on a Web site&mdash;not to
&ldquo;Increase the font
size&rdquo;, which would have hinted at the menu action they would need to
use to accomplish the task.
</p><p>
Because I work on a university campus, I invited students, faculty
and staff to participate in a usability study. Volunteers were selected
without preference for gender, age group or level of experience. This
reflects GNOME's preference to target a broad range of users. Each
tester was given a $5 gift card to the campus coffee shop as a &ldquo;thank
you&rdquo;
for participating in the usability test.
</p><p>
In total, 12 testers participated in the usability test, representing
a mix of genders and an age range spanning 18&ndash;74. Participants
self-identified their level of computer expertise on a scale from 1 to 5,
where 1 indicated &ldquo;No knowledge&rdquo; and 5 meant &ldquo;Computer
expert&rdquo;. No testers
self-identified as either 1 or 5. Instead they filled a range between
&ldquo;2: I
know some things, but not a lot&rdquo;, and &ldquo;4: I am better than
most&rdquo;,
with an average rating of 3.25 and a mode of &ldquo;3: I am pretty
average.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Before each usability test session, every participant received a brief
description of the usability study, explaining that this was a usability
test of the software, not of them. This introduction also encouraged
testers to communicate their thought process. If searching for a print
action, for example, the participant should state &ldquo;I am looking
for a 'Print' button.&rdquo; Testers were provided a laptop running a
&ldquo;liveUSB&rdquo; image of GNOME 3.12 containing a set of example files,
including the text file used in the gedit scenario tasks. However, the
USB image proved unstable for most programs in the usability test. To
mitigate the stability issues, I rebooted the laptop into Fedora 20 and
GNOME 3.10 to complete the scenario tasks for Web, Nautilus, Software and
Notes. In testing GNOME, each participant used a separate guest account
that had been pre-loaded with the same example files. These example
files also included items unrelated to the usability test, similar to
how real users keep a variety of documents, photos and other files on
their computers, allowing participants to navigate these contents to
locate files and folders required for the scenario tasks.
</p><p>
At the end of each usability test, I briefly interviewed the testers to
probe their responses to the tasks and programs, to better understand what
they were thinking during certain tasks that seemed particularly easy
or difficult. Overall, the usability test included 23 scenario tasks,
which most testers completed in 50&ndash;55 minutes.

My Usability Test Results</h2></div></div><p>
The value of a usability test is finding areas where the program is
difficult to use, so developers can improve the interface in the next
version. To do that, you need to identify the tasks that were difficult
for most users to perform.
</p><p>
You easily can see the usability test results by using a heat map. This
kind of visualization neatly summarizes the results of the usability
test. In the heat map, each scenario task is represented in a separate
row, and each block in the row represents a tester's experience with
that task (Figure 1). Green blocks indicate tasks that testers completed with
little or no difficulty, and yellow blocks signify tasks that presented
moderate difficulty. Red boxes denote tasks where testers experienced
extreme difficulty or where testers completed tasks incorrectly. Black
blocks indicate tasks the tester was unable to complete, while white
boxes indicate tasks omitted from the test, usually for lack of time.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11757f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Usability Heat Map
</p></div></div><p>
The &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; in the heat map show tasks that were difficult
for testers.
</p><p>
1) Interestingly, all participants experienced significant issues with
changing the default font in gedit (GNOME 3.12). A significant number of
testers were unable to accomplish a similar task in Notes. In observing
the tests, the testers typically looked for a &ldquo;font&rdquo; or
&ldquo;text&rdquo;
action under the gear menu. Many participants referred to the gear menu as
the &ldquo;options&rdquo; or &ldquo;settings&rdquo; menu because of a previous affiliation
with the gear icon and &ldquo;settings&rdquo; in other Mac OS X and Windows
applications (Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11757f2.large.jpg"><img src="11757f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Header Bar for gedit, Showing the Gear Menu
</p></div></div><p>
These participants expected that changing the font was an
option in the program, and therefore searched for a &ldquo;font&rdquo; action
under the gear or &ldquo;options&rdquo; menu. Part of this confusion stemmed
from thinking of the text editor as though it were a word processor, such
as Microsoft Word, which uses items in menus or on a toolbar to set the
document font. This behavior often was exhibited by first highlighting
all the text in the document before searching for a &ldquo;font&rdquo; action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11757f2.large.jpg"><img src="11757f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Header Bar for gedit, Showing the Gear Menu
</p></div></div><p>
2) In the Nautilus file manager, testers also experienced serious
difficulty in creating a bookmark to a folder. In GNOME, this task is
usually achieved by clicking into the target folder then selecting
&ldquo;Bookmark this Location&rdquo; from the gear menu, or by clicking and
dragging the intended folder onto &ldquo;Bookmarks&rdquo; in the left pane
(Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11757f2.large.jpg"><img src="11757f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Dragging a Folder to Create a Bookmark in Nautilus
</p></div></div><p>
However, testers initially addressed this task by attempting
to drag the folder onto the GNOME desktop. When interviewed about this
response, almost all participants indicated that they prefer to keep
frequently accessed folders on the desktop for easier access. Most
testers eventually moved the target folder into the Desktop folder in
their Home directory, and believed they successfully completed the task
even though the target folder did not appear on the desktop.
</p><p>
3) Testers also experienced difficulty when attempting &ldquo;find and replace
text&rdquo; in gedit. In this task, testers employed the
&ldquo;Find&rdquo; feature in
gedit to search for text in the document. Experimenting with
&ldquo;Find&rdquo;,
testers said they expected to replace at the same time they searched
for text. After several failed attempts, testers usually were able to
invoke the &ldquo;Find and Replace&rdquo; action successfully under the gear menu.
</p><p>
Although the overall GNOME desktop was not part of the usability test,
many testers experienced difficulty with the GNOME
&ldquo;Activities&rdquo;
hot corner. In the GNOME desktop environment, the Activities menu
reveals a view of currently running programs and a selection of available
programs. Users can trigger the Activities menu either by clicking
the &ldquo;Activities&rdquo; word button in the upper-left corner of the screen
or by moving the mouse into that corner (the &ldquo;hot corner&rdquo;). Although
testers generally recovered quickly from the unexpected &ldquo;hot
corner&rdquo;
action, this feature caused significant issues during the usability test.

General Issues</h2></div></div><p>
The open-source software usability challenge is cultural. To date,
usability has been antithetical to open-source software philosophy,
where most projects start by solving a problem that is interesting to the
developer, and new features are incorporated based on need. Crafting new
functionality takes priority, and open-source developers rarely consider
how end users will access those features.
</p><p>
However, a key strength of open-source software development is the
developer-user relationship. In open-source software projects, the user
community plays a strong role in testing new releases. Unfortunately,
testers cannot rely on the typical user-testing cycle to provide
sufficient user interface feedback. Developers can learn a great deal
simply by observing a few users interacting with the program and making
note where testers have problems. This is the essence of a usability test.
</p><p>
Usability tests need not be performed in a formal laboratory environment,
and developers do not need to be experts in order to apply usability
testing methodology to their projects. Developers need only observe users
interacting with the program for usability issues to become clear. A
handful of usability testers operating against a prototype provides
sufficient feedback to make informed usability improvements. And with
good usability, everyone wins.
