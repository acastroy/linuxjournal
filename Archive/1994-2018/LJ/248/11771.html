<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #248, December 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Containers</b></span> are very tricky to implement. Trying to isolate sets
of resources from each other completely, so that they resemble a discrete
system, and doing it in a secure way, has to be addressed on a feature-by-feature
basis, with many caveats and uncertainties. Over time, this makes the
core kernel code more secure and robust, but each individual feature
may have surprising issues.
</p><p>
The whole <span   class="bold"><b>namespace</b></span> idea&mdash;corralling subsets of system resources like
user IDs and group IDs, and performing on-the-fly translations between
the resource names within the container and the corresponding names in
the outer system&mdash;is tough to manage.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Marian Marinov</b></span> noticed that process counters in the outer system
counted processes as being owned by the same user if his or her UIDs (user IDs)
were the same inside two separate containers. The same was true for GIDs
(group IDs). He didn't like this, because the two containers represented
two logically isolated systems, and in that context, the same UIDs could
refer to different users entirely. They shouldn't be counted together.
</p><p>
He wanted to patch the kernel to isolate these values, so that the
process counters wouldn't get them mixed up with each other. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Eric
W. Biederman</b></span> didn't like Marian's idea of creating namespace-specific
data structures within the kernel. He offered some workarounds, but Marian
didn't like any of them. He said they were less efficient than his idea,
and they would require him to put a lot of effort into redesigning his
particular use case, which ran a batch of identical containers, each
built out of a single master template.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Eric suggested implementing something akin to Marian's idea,
but only for certain filesystems. The problem, he said, was that <span   class="bold"><b>XFS</b></span>
exposed too much of its inner workings to userspace, making it hard to
perform the namespace translations correctly. If they limited support
only to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; filesystems, Eric said, it would be much easier to give
Marian what he wanted.
</p><p>
But, <span   class="bold"><b>James Bottomley</b></span> pointed out that Linux distributions wouldn't
sacrifice XFS for anything. It had already been tried with the <span   class="bold"><b>USER_NS</b></span>
feature. Distributions wouldn't accept USER_NS unless it supported
XFS. James argued that the same would be true here.
</p><p>
Eric replied that the two cases were different. His solution would not
preclude using XFS in a Linux distribution; it would only preclude
using a particular use case that didn't currently exist anyway. And,
Eric also argued that XFS already had serious issues that made it less
container-friendly than other filesystems. It was hard to migrate an XFS
filesystem to a system with different endianness and word size. This meant
one of the common container uses&mdash;migrating processes and containers
between machines&mdash;already was partially off the table for XFS, at least
for the moment. That being the case, Eric said, it didn't make sense to
go to great lengths to support it in a feature it couldn't use until so
many other XFS characteristics had been fixed.
</p><p>
The debate undoubtedly will continue. Ultimately, the question involves
identifying where to draw a line between seemingly integrated features of
the kernel. What parts of the system can be containerized safely? What
parts have to wait until other issues are addressed? In some cases,
the end result will be much cleaner kernel code; in other cases, in the
short term, much messier.
</p><p>
Some features get so big and complicated that they can't be changed
easily anymore. In particular, it becomes harder to fix design flaws, because each
fix has to account for all the existing special wonkiness. The <span   class="bold"><b>printk()</b></span>
function is one example. Its code apparently has become such a nightmare
that kernel developers must choose worse solutions to their problems,
just in order to avoid a redesign process that is made so difficult by
printk()'s current insane implementation.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Petr Mladek</b></span> submitted some code to allow calling printk() from
within an <span   class="bold"><b>NMI</b></span> (non-maskable interrupt). This is useful when a system is in
the midst of crashing and needs to output logging data to help the user
identify what went wrong. The problem was that printk() needed to take a
lock that might be held by another process. That's a big no-no in NMIs,
because the whole point of NMIs is that they never can be interrupted by
other processes. The printk() would loop forever, waiting for a process
to release a lock, when that process would never get the CPU cycles it
needed to release that lock. Presto, deadlock.
</p><p>
Petr's code solved this by taking the lock only if available and failing
over to an alternate solution if necessary. Overall, Petr's code improved
the situation, because users actually were seeing lockups that could be
better-diagnosed with printk()s in NMIs. Specifically, <span   class="bold"><b>Jiri Kosina</b></span> said,
&ldquo;we've actually seen the lockups triggered by the RCU stall detector trying
to dump stacks on all CPUs, and hard-locking the machine up while doing
so.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But, as <span   class="bold"><b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Weisbecker</b></span>
put it, the printk() code base was an &ldquo;ancient
design&rdquo; with &ldquo;fundamental flaws&rdquo;. Its poor design forced Petr's patch
to be 1,000 lines long when such a fix ordinarily might be much smaller
(<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> later estimated 15 lines as a good size for Petr's
features). Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric suggested, &ldquo;shouldn't we rather redesign it to
use a lockless ring buffer like ftrace or perf ones?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Jiri agreed that the printk() code base was &ldquo;a stinking pile of
you-know-what&rdquo;, and that a redesign would be better than Petr's stop-gap
patch. But in fact, he said, the correct design was not yet known, but
regardless certainly would take a long time to implement and would
delay Petr's important fix that addressed real-world crashes. And as
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric added, there also was the danger that &ldquo;if we push back this
bugfix, nobody will actually do that desired rewrite.&rdquo;
</p><p>
At some point, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric asked for Linus' opinion, and Linus essentially
torpedoed Petr's whole approach. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Printing from NMI context isn't really supposed to work, and we all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> it's not supposed to work.
</p><p>
I'd much rather disallow it, and if there is one or two places that
really want to print a warning and know that they are in NMI context,
have a special workaround just for them, with something that does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
try to make printk in general work any better.
</p><p>
Dammit, NMI context is special. I absolutely refuse to buy into the
broken concept that we should make more stuff work in NMI context. Hell
no, we should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> try to make more crap work in NMI. NMI people should
be careful.
</p><p>
Make a trivial &ldquo;printk_nmi()&rdquo; wrapper that tries to do a trylock on
logbuf_lock, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>maybe</em></span> the existing sequence of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if (console_trylock_for_printk())
        console_unlock();
</pre>
</p><p>
then works for actually triggering the printout. But the wrapper should
be 15 lines of code for &ldquo;if possible, try to print things&rdquo;,
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
a thousand lines of changes.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Which, Petr said, was exactly what his patch did, but he just needed
1,000 lines of code instead of 15 because of how broken printk() was
already. And Jiri said, &ldquo;I find it rather outrageous that fixing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real
bugs</em></span> (leading to hangs) becomes impossible due to printk() being too
complex. It's very unfortunate that the same level of pushback didn't
happen when new features (that actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>made</em></span> it so complicated) have
been pushed; that would be much more valuable and appropriate.&rdquo;
</p><p>
At this point, <span   class="bold"><b>Paul McKenney</b></span> offered a compromise. Since Petr's patch
was inspired by the <span   class="bold"><b>RCU</b></span> (read-copy-update) stall detector using NMIs to
dump the stack, and thus needing printk(), Paul could rewrite the RCU
code to avoid using NMIs for the stack dump. This way, regular printk()
would work, without requiring Petr's patch.
</p><p>
The problem with this was that RCU wouldn't do <span   class="emphasis"><em>quite</em></span> as good a job
of dumping the stack data. As Jiri put it, &ldquo;this is prone to producing
not really consistent stacktraces though, right? As the target task is
still running at the time the stack is being walked, it might produce
stacktraces that are potentially nonsensical.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But, Linus was insistent. He said, &ldquo;We should stop using nmi as if it
was something 'normal'. It isn't. Code running in nmi context should
be special, and should be very very aware that it is special. That goes
way beyond 'don't use printk'. We seem to have gone way way too far in
using nmi context. So we should get <span   class="emphasis"><em>rid</em></span> of code in nmi context rather
than then complain about printk being buggy.&rdquo;
</p><p>
So, Paul's solution, even being known to provide worse stack dumps than
Petr's, would be adopted, simply because it could avoid making further
changes to printk(). Jiri said, &ldquo;I feel bad about the fact that we are
now hostages of our printk() implementation, which doesn't allow for any
fixes/improvements. Having the possibility to printk() from NMI would
be nice and more robust...otherwise, we'll be getting people trying
to do it in the future over and over again, even if we now get rid of
it at once.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Google Keep</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #248, December 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love Evernote. I pay for a premium membership, and to be honest, I don't
think I even use the premium features. I just love Evernote so much,
I want to support the company. But in the spirit of fair comparison,
I forced myself to try Google Keep.
</p><p>
It's pretty neat. Honestly though, even though Google Keep has matured
quite a bit, I don't see it as a competitor with Evernote. I thought
that was what it was going to be, but to me it seems more like a really
awesome sticky-note program that syncs seamlessly between devices. The Web
interface (<a href="http://keep.google.com" target="_self">keep.google.com</a>) mirrors the Android app almost exactly,
and it syncs in what seems like real time. You can grab notes to rearrange
them, and yes, you can search notes using Google's powerful search engine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11771androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11771androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Perhaps it's the lack of integration with other apps, or perhaps it's
just that Google Keep is so new compared to Evernote, but I couldn't
use it on a daily basis for more than quick notes here and there. I'd
be curious to know if there are any Google Keep fanatics out there who
can't imagine life without it. For me, Evernote combined with Nixnote is
still the ultimate tool for keeping track of, well, everything! Download
Google Keep from the Google Play store and give it a try. It really is
a neat app, and if you're not an Evernote addict, it might be perfect!

<h2 class="title">Autokey: Shorthand for Typists</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #248, December 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For years I avoided installing keyboard shortcut tools on my computers. I
thought dog-gonnit, if something needed to be typed out, I'd type every
letter myself. Recently I capitulated, however, and I must say, going
back seems unlikely. If you've never tried a text-replacement app, I
highly recommend doing so. The time it saves is incredible, and after
I abandoned my grouchy old ways, I've grown to love it.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there aren't too many options in Linux for really good
text-replacement apps. My personal favorite is Autokey. It can be a
challenge to set up, but that's mainly because it's so powerful. If you
want text replacement to work only in a particular app (think programming
code shortcuts), it can be set to work only with those apps. If you
want to have a special hotkey required before text replacement works,
that's an option too. In the screenshot here, you can see I make
a simple auto-replacement shortcut so that every time I type
&ldquo;ttt&rdquo;,
it replaces it with a sentence. It works only in gedit, because that's
the constraint I set in the settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11771autokeyf1.large.jpg"><img src="11771autokeyf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Even though it has a very complicated interface, the Autokey program
is a great program, and one we hope continues to get updated once it
no longer works. It's currently available for Ubuntu 12.04 and below,
but it will install on recent versions without a problem. Autokey takes
this month's Editors' Choice award, because once you start using it,
you won't be able to imagine life without it! Get your copy today at

<h2 class="title">A GUI for Your CLI?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #248, December 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For new Linux users, the command line is arguably the most intimidating
thing. For crusty veterans like me, green text on a black background is
as cozy as fuzzy slippers by a fireplace, but I still see CLI Companion
as a pretty cool application.
</p><p>
The concept is pretty easy. It's a GUI environment that allows you to
double-click your way into entering CLI commands. You can create your
own commands (sort of like bookmarks for the command line), or you can
search from within the large database of common applications. Oh, and
if the command requires command-line arguments? The application pops up
a window prompting you to enter them in.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11771clif1.large.jpg"><img src="11771clif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you're a dyed-in-the-wool Linux professional, CLI Companion might seem
like a silly thing to install. If the command line is intimidating, on the
other hand, it might be the perfect tool to help you gain mastery. Heck,
as I scrolled through the database of applications, I learned a few
command-line tools I didn't know existed!
</p><p>

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Don't Type All Those Words!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #248, December 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We mention Autokey later in this issue as a great tool for text replacement in
real time on Linux. Thankfully, there's an option for Windows users that
actually is even more powerful than Autokey! AutoHotkey is a similarly
named application that runs strictly under Windows. It's still FOSS,
but there's unfortunately no version for Linux.
</p><p>
The premise for AutoHotkey is the same as Autokey for Linux. Type a quick
short bit of text, and it will expand that shortcut into the predefined text
you tell it to use. I find this useful while programming, as creating those
curly braces in pairs is very useful. The program is a bit of a bear to
configure, because there's no GUI to configure keys. In order to configure
the program, you write a text-based script that defines your shortcuts.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11771fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11771fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
AutoHotkey (AHK it's sometimes called) even allows you to pre-compile
your shortcuts into an executable so you don't need to re-program them
when you move to a new computer. Grab your .exe file, and run it when
you visit your folks for the holidays. (But don't make a shortcut that
automatically misspells your sibling's name when your parents type
it...or if you do, don't blame me!)
</p><p>
AutoHotkey is free, and it's available at <a href="http://ahkscript.org" target="_self">ahkscript.org</a>. There's a
nice quick-start tutorial as well to help you get started, because like
I mentioned, it's a little rough at first. If you're stuck typing a lot
of text on a Windows machine, check out AutoHotkey today!

<h2 class="title">Computing without a Computer</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #248, December 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've covered a lot of various pieces of software that are designed
to help you do scientific calculations of one type or another, but I
have neglected a whole class of computational tools that is rarely used
anymore. Before there was the electronic computer, computations had
to be made by hand, so they were error-prone. To try to minimize
these human errors, shortcuts and aids of one form or another were
developed. 
</p><p>
A common computational problem is to solve equations of
some number of variables. The tool that was developed for this class
of problem is the nomograph, or nomogram. A nomograph uses a graphical
representation of an equation to make solving the equation as simple as
setting down a straightedge and reading off the result. Once a nomograph
is constructed, it is one of the fastest ways to solve an equation by
hand. 
</p><p>
In this article, I explore some common nomographs that many of you
likely will have seen, and I take a look at a Python package, PyNomo
(<a href="http://www.pynomo.org" target="_self">www.pynomo.org</a>), that you can use to create your
own. I also walk
through creating some new nomographs, which hopefully will inspire you
to try creating some too.
</p><p>
First, let me explain what a nomograph actually is. Electrical
engineers already should have seen and used one example, the Smith
chart. This chart provides a very quick way to solve problems involved with
transmission lines and matching circuits. Solving these types of problems
by hand was a very tedious task that wasted quite a lot of time, so the
introduction of the Smith chart increased productivity immensely. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11771pynomof1.large.jpg"><img src="11771pynomof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. With a Smith chart, you can work on problems around transmission
lines and circuit matching.
</p></div></div><p>
A Smith
chart is scaled in normalized impedance, or normalized admittance, or
both. The scaling around the outside is in wavelengths and degrees. The
wavelength scale measures the distance along the transmission line
between the generator and the load. The degree scale measures the angle
of the voltage reflection coefficient at that point. Since impedance and
admittance change as frequency changes, you can solve problems
only for one frequency at a time. The result calculated at one frequency
is a single point on the Smith chart. For wider bandwidth problems,
you just need to solve for a number of frequencies to get the behaviour
over the full range. 
But, because this isn't meant to be a lesson in electrical
engineering, I will leave it as an exercise for the reader to see just
how many other problems can be solved with a Smith chart. 
</p><p>
Another example,
which should be recognizable to any parent, is the height/weight charts
used by doctors. These charts allow a doctor to take the weight and
height of a child and see where he or she fits on a nonlinear scale that
compares one child to the available statistics of a population very
quickly. This is much easier than plugging those values into an equation
and trying to calculate it manually.
</p><p>
But, what can you do if you want to use a totally new type of
nomograph? Enter the Python module PyNomo. The easiest way to install
PyNomo is to use pip. You would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install PyNomo
</pre>
</p><p>
You may need to preface this command with <tt  >sudo</tt> if you want it
installed as a system module. To get started, you need to import everything
from the nomographer section with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from pynomo.nomographer import *
</pre>
</p><p>
This section contains the main Nomographer class that actually generates
the nomograph you want to create. There are ten types of nomographs that
you can create with PyNomo:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Type 1: three parallel lines
</p></li><li><p>
Type 2: N or Z
</p></li><li><p>
Type 3: N parallel lines
</p></li><li><p>
Type 4: proportion
</p></li><li><p>
Type 5: contour
</p></li><li><p>
Type 6: ladder
</p></li><li><p>
Type 7: angle
</p></li><li><p>
Type 8: single
</p></li><li><p>
Type 9: general determinant
</p></li><li><p>
Type 10: one curved line
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Each of these also is described by a mathematical relationship between
the various elements. For example, a type 1 nomograph is described by
the relationship:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F1(u1) + F2(u2) + F3(u3) = 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Each element of a given nomograph must be of one type or another. But,
they can be mixed together as separate elements of a complete nomograph. A
simple example, borrowed from the PyNomo examples on the main Web site,
is a temperature converter for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit
degrees. It is generated out of two type 8 blocks. Each block is defined
by a parameter object, where you can set maximum and minimum values,
titles and tick levels, as well as several other options. A block for a
scale going from &ndash;40 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F_para={'tag':'A',
        'u_min':'-40.0,
	'u_max':'90.0,
	'function':lambda u:celcius(u),
	'title':r'$^\circ$ F',
	'tick_levels':4,
	'tick_text_levels':3,
	'align_func':celcius,
	'title_x_shift':0.5
	}
</pre>
</p><p>
You will need a similar parameter list for the Celsius scale. Once you
have that, you need to create block definitions for each of the scales,
which looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
C_block={'block_type':'type_8',
	    'f_params':C_para }
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step is to define a parameter list for the main Nomographer
class. For the temperature converter, you can use something like the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
main_params={'filename':'temp_converter.pdf',
             'paper_height':20.0,
             'paper_width':2.0,
             'block_params':[C_block,F_block],
             'transformations':[('scale paper')]
             }
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can create the nomograph you are working on with the Python
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Nomographer(main_params)
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11771pynomof2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A simple nomograph is a Celsius-Fahrenheit temperature
conversion scale.
</p></div></div><p>
A more complicated example is a nomograph to help with the calculations
involved in celestial navigation. To handle such a complex
problem, you need to use a type 9 nomograph. This type is a completely
general form. You need to define a determinant form to describe all of the
various interactions. If the constituents are functions of one variable,
they will create a regular scale. If they are of two variables,
they will create a grid section. For example, one of the single
scales in this example would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
'g':lambda u:-cos(u*pi/180.0)
</pre>
</p><p>
Whereas the grid is defined by:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
'g_grid':lambda u,v:-sin(u*pi/180.0)*sin(v*pi/180.0)
</pre>

Figure 3. You even can do something as complicated as celestial navigation
with a nomograph.
</p></div></div><p>
Once this nomograph is constructed, you can use it to compute the
altitude azimuth.
</p><p>
PyNomo goes through several steps in generating the nomograph. The last
step is to apply any transformations to the various parts. Transformations
to individual components can be applied only to type 9 nomographs. If you
do apply transformations to individual components, you need
to make sure that relative scalings between the various parts are still
correct. For other nomograph types, transformations can be applied
only to the entire nomograph. There aren't a large number of transformations
available yet, but there are enough to handle most customizations that
you may want to make. The transformations available are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
scale paper: scale the nomograph to the size defined by paper_height
and paper_width.
</p></li><li><p>
rotate: rotates the nomograph through the given number of degrees.
</p></li><li><p>
polygon: applies a twisting transformation to the tops and
bottoms of the various scales.
</p></li><li><p>
optimize: tries to optimize numerically the sum squared lengths of
the axes with respect to paper area.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With these transformations, you should be able to get the look you want
for your nomograph.
</p><p>
Now that you know about nomographs, and even more important, how to
make them, you really have no excuse to avoid your trip to that isolated
South Pacific island. Go ahead and play with PyNomo and see
what other kinds of nomographs you can make and use.
