At this point in history, arguments for using Linux, FOSS (free and open-source software) and the Internet make themselves. Yet the virtues behind
those things&mdash;freedom, openness, compatibility, interoperability,
substitutability&mdash;still tend to be ignored by commercial builders of
new stuff. 
</p><p>
For example, US health care, like pretty much every business category, is
full of Linux and FOSS, and is to some degree connected on the Net. Yet, it
remains a vast feudal system of suppliers that nearly all work to lock
doctors, hospitals and labs into dependency on closed, proprietary,
incompatible, non-interoperable and non-substitutable systems. I've
witnessed these up close as a patient. In one case, diagnostic scans by one
machine and software system couldn't be read by computers with software
designed to read the output of a different company's scans. In another
case, records kept by one specialty failed to inform another specialty in
the same hospital. The first one gave me a case of pancreatitis, and the
second one gave my mother a fatal stroke.
</p><p>
We are seeing the same thing start to happen already with the Internet of
Things (IoT), about which Bruce Sterling
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling</a>) has written a brilliant essay
titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Epic Struggle of The Internet of Things</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Epic-Struggle-Internet-Things-ebook/dp/B00N8AIFYC" target="_self">www.amazon.com/The-Epic-Struggle-Internet-Things-ebook/dp/B00N8AIFYC</a>).
&ldquo;The first thing to
understand about the 'Internet of Things'&rdquo;, he says, &ldquo;is that
it's not
about Things on the Internet. It's a code term that powerful
stakeholders have settled on for their own purposes. They like the slogan
'Internet of Things' because it sounds peaceable and progressive. It
disguises the epic struggle over power, money and influence that is about
to ensue. There is genuine Internet technology involved in the 'Internet of
Things'. However, the legacy Internet of yesterday is a shrinking part of
what is at stake now.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It's actually worse than that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
An Internet of Things is not a consumer society. It's a materialized
network society. It's like a Google or Facebook writ large on the
landscape.
</p><p>
Google and Facebook don't have &ldquo;users&rdquo; or
&ldquo;customers&rdquo;. Instead, they
have participants under machine surveillance, whose activities are
algorithmically combined within Big Data silos. They don't need the
reader to be the hero. He's not some rational, autonomous, economic
actor who decides to encourage the Internet of Things with his purchasing
dollars. They're much better off when those decisions are not his to
make.
</p><p>
The reader may be allowed to choose the casing of his smartphone and the
brand of his vacuum cleaner, but the digital relation between the two of
them is not his decision. He still has a role of sorts, but it's much
like the role he has within Google and Facebook. He gets fantastic services
free of charge, and he responds mostly with dropdown menus and check boxes,
while generating data whose uses and values are invisible to him.
</p><p>
The reader didn't build the phone or the vacuum cleaner. He can't repair or
modify them. He doesn't understand their technical workings, and when the
two of them interact (by various adroit forms of wireless communication),
he's not in charge of that, or of where the data goes....
</p><p>
The reader is not a &ldquo;customer&rdquo; of Facebook because he never paid for
Facebook. Facebook's genuine customers are the marketers&mdash;those who
pay Facebook for the hard labour of surveilling the billion people on
Facebook. Facebook is one of the &ldquo;Big Five&rdquo; of Facebook, Amazon, Google,
Microsoft and Apple....
</p><p>
The Big Five are the genuine heroes of the Internet of Things. The epic
drama of the Internet of Things is really their story. It's not a popular
uprising&mdash;except in the sense that the Big Five are really, really,
really &ldquo;popular&rdquo;&mdash;because billions of people are willingly involved in
their systems. The Internet of Things is basically a recognition by other
power-players that the methods of the Big Five have won, and that they
should be emulated.
</p><p>
The Big Five are smart, profitable, capable and colossal. They are as
entirely free of political constraint as the railroads or Standard Oil were
in their own heyday....
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Phil Windley calls this The Compuserve of Things
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2014/04/the_compuserve_of_things.shtml</a>),
and says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
On the Net today we face a choice between freedom and captivity,
independence and dependence. How we build the Internet of Things has
far-reaching consequences for the humans who will use&mdash;or be used
by&mdash;it. Will we push forward, connecting things using forests of silos
that are reminiscent the online services of the 1980s, or will we learn
the lessons of the Internet and build a true Internet of Things?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Well, it depends on who &ldquo;we&rdquo; are. If we're geeks like most
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
readers, we're already doing our part, laboring away on free and
open-source stuff, and using as much free and open stuff as we
can. But we're
not the ones running the companies building closed and silo'd systems,
including proprietary networks of things. And those folks aren't getting
the lessons we've been teaching for decades. Why is that?
</p><p>
One dividing line is between standards and platforms built on them. This is
also the line between infrastructure and commerce in the &ldquo;layers of
time&rdquo;
graphic from The Long Now Foundation (<a href="http://longnow.org" target="_self">longnow.org</a>)&mdash;see Figure
1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11778f1.large.jpg"><img src="11778f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
FOSS building materials are all at the Infrastructure layer. So are the
standards that create the Net and the Web: TCP/IP, HTTP and the rest. These
and countless thousands (millions?) of standards and code bases support
boundless freedom and generativity for everything that's built on them and
with them, up at the Commerce and Fashion-Art levels.
</p><p>
But all the Big Five, while founded on those standards, and packed with
FOSS code, need to compete at the commerce level. This tends to subordinate
freedom, interop, generativity and the rest&mdash;except within their own
feudal empires. There they can do a pretty good job.
</p><p>
For example, most of the big platforms come with SDKs (software development
kits), APIs (application programming interfaces) and other means for
encouraging, producing and supporting lots of code&mdash;and dependencies.
This is why there are more than a billion apps each on iOS and Android.
</p><p>
But platforms can also change fast
(<a href="http://scripting.com/2014/07/07/comparingApis.html" target="_self">scripting.com/2014/07/07/comparingApis.html</a>) and put dependent developers and users
at their mercy, as many discovered when Twitter pulled the rug out from
under them in 2012 by changing its API
(<a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/twitter-to-developers-screw-you-guys-1092570" target="_self">www.techradar.com/us/news/world-of-tech/twitter-to-developers-screw-you-guys-1092570</a>). This was a huge interop fail for
many code bases, some of which died.
</p><p>
Infrastructural standards and code bases (such as Linux and Apache) come up
from lowest level&mdash;Nature&mdash;and bubble up through their cultures
and governance norms. None of those norms arise from government policies,
in spite of what the Governance layer suggests in that graphic. As David
Clark (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Clark" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_D._Clark</a>) famously
put it to (and for) the IETF in 1992, &ldquo;We reject: kings,
presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running
code&rdquo;
(Lessig, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Code 2.0</em></span>, p. 4:
<a href="http://www.codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf" target="_self">www.codev2.cc/download+remix/Lessig-Codev2.pdf</a>).
</p><p>
Geeks working down in the lower geology layers tend to be as oblivious to
what happens at the Commerce and Fashion layers as the core of the Earth is
to civilization. Some of us have heard Linus say &ldquo;I do
kernel space&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linfo.org/kernel_space.html" target="_self">www.linfo.org/kernel_space.html</a>). &ldquo;I
don't do user space&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linfo.org/user_space.html" target="_self">www.linfo.org/user_space.html</a>). That's because Linux developers make a sharp
distinction between those two spaces, by name. The deep nature of Linux is
in its kernel, whose job (as working infrastructure) is to support
everything above it without prejudice
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8664" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8664</a>). In other words, it tries to be as
neutral as possible.
</p><p>
But up at the Commerce and Fashion-Art levels, where most people acquire
goods and live with them, few are concerned that a billion+ iOS apps run
only on Apple hardware, or that a billion+ Android apps run on hardware
from makers required to privilege Google's apps first. Or that the walls of
those feudal empires block views toward negative externalities, one of
which is restricted (or absent) inter-empire interoperability. As a result
we have a marketplace where the benefits of freedom and
openness&mdash;taught by the Net, the Web, open standards, open code and
open hardware&mdash;aren't seen, because their first causes are out of sight: buried down
at the infrastructure layer and below.
</p><p>
But some geeks aren't forgetting. Cory Doctorow (<a href="http://craphound.com" target="_self">craphound.com</a>), for example, warns of a
coming &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; (<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html" target="_self">boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html</a>) between
general-purpose and special-purpose computing.
The white-box PC, for example, is general-purpose. Meanwhile, we still have
no equivalent with smartphones and tablets. Instead we have closed and
locked things that foreclose on many freedoms.
</p><p>
The Net and the Web were both built on software and hardware that leveraged
standard, open and general-purpose equipment, protocols and code
bases.
Smartphones and tablets take advantage of those things, but limit what
people can do with them. Apps are available only in stores, which are
closed and private. Apps themselves also tend to be silo'd. They may
operate on your phone, but don't easily interoperate with each other. Try
gathering data from all your fitness and health apps into a place of your
own. Even if you can, such as with DigiFit (<a href="http://www.digifit.com" target="_self">www.digifit.com</a>), it's in yet another company's
silo.
</p><p>
Research on the questions raised by these issues is remarkably thin. Toward
relieving that, Urs Gasser (<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/ugasser" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/ugasser</a>) and John Palfrey
(<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jpalfrey" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jpalfrey</a>), colleagues of mine at the
Berkman Center (<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu</a>), published <span   class="emphasis"><em>Interop: The Promise and Perils of Highly
Interconnected Systems</em></span>, in 2012
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Interop-Promise-Perils-Interconnected-Systems/dp/0465021972" target="_self">www.amazon.com/Interop-Promise-Perils-Interconnected-Systems/dp/0465021972</a>).
In it they argue for &ldquo;a nuanced and stable
theory of interoperability&rdquo; that can resolve issues at the four layers at
which they see interoperability playing: technological, data, human and
institutional. 
</p><p>
I've been watching problems at all four layers for the past eight years
through ProjectVRM (<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/Main_Page</a>), which seeks to provide individuals with tools for both
independence and engagement in the commercial world. All the projects and
companies on our developers list
(<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work</a>) do their best to reconcile the need for
interop and substitutability with commercial imperatives: attracting
investment and partners, competing and so on.
</p><p>
Some efforts are formal and involve a number of players that compete in a
cooperative framework. The Respect Network (<a href="https://www.respectnetwork.com" target="_self">https://www.respectnetwork.com</a>), for example, includes dozens of
partner organizations committed to the Respect Trust Framework
(<a href="http://openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework" target="_self">openidentityexchange.org/trust-frameworks/respect-trust-framework</a>), which
assures both interoperability and substitutability between service
providers.
</p><p>
But it's an uphill battle, and has been for a long time.
</p><p>
As I see it (and I've been looking at this for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> since the
mid-1990s), the biggest conflict for Interop is freedom vs. captivity.
Developers that value freedom tend to maximize interop, while developers
that value captivity tend to minimize interop. And most of what we get are
compromises.
</p><p>
I believe the main problem is simply ignorance of consequences, which is an
old problem with business. But I also believe in research. Urs recently
wrote to one of the Berkman lists, asking for &ldquo;the most challenging,
fascinating, puzzling...interop stories, questions, problems,
opportunities...that you've been thinking about recently&rdquo;&mdash;toward
fresh research on interop.
