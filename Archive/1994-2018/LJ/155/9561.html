Novell has failed to learn from history, and is
    doomed to repeat it after having made a deal with Microsoft.</p><p>Before I continue, consider that I am one of the most pragmatic and therefore least religious among Linux
    advocates.  I see nothing wrong with good proprietary commercial software from reliable sources.  I think the DCMA,
    not TiVo, is the problem when it comes to TiVoization.  Let me add that when IBM behaved as a controlling monopolist
    that did not work in the best interests of its customers, I repeatedly blew the whistle on IBM's monopolistic
    business practices.  (Obviously, I've been writing for a long time.) Now I am a fan of IBM.  As with IBM, my
    criticism of Microsoft is not personal.  If Microsoft ever changes its ways of doing business, as IBM did, I will
    gladly support the company.  But Microsoft has shown no signs that it has abandoned its Machiavellian
    tactics.</p><p>My point is that the following is not the rantings of a free software or Linux zealot, nor is the following
    the rantings of a mindless Microsoft basher.  It is simply the truth, as best as I can see it.</p><p>Microsoft is an enemy of Linux, if not
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> enemy.  Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to read Steve Ballmer's statement that everyone
    who runs Linux owes money to Microsoft.  But it's worse than that.  Microsoft is a company run by megalomaniacs bent
    on control and domination of every market the company enters.  Therefore, every time Microsoft makes a deal, it
    makes it with the ultimate goal of marginalizing the competition&mdash;not destroying all competition, lest it risk
    another bout with DOJ, but marginalizing it enough to prevent it from posing a threat to its dominance and market
    leverage.  For every deal Microsoft makes that seems beneficial to anyone but Microsoft, you will find an ulterior
    motive in line with the aforementioned goal.  For example, when you peel back the layers of Microsoft's
    philanthropic deals for Windows, you'll find the internal memo that instructs sales to offer such gestures only
    where Linux is a threat.</p><p>History is littered with the battered bodies left from such deals.  I find it somewhat poetic that I first
    heard the term
    &ldquo;coopetition&rdquo; at a Novell press event, long ago.  Novell announced that it made a deal with Microsoft,
    and then subjected editors to such an overdose of the words
    &ldquo;coopetition&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;partnering&rdquo;, it is still painful to write these words today.  I don't recall the date of the event,
    but it was roughly 1&ndash;3 years before Windows NT essentially buried NetWare.  Granted, Microsoft probably
    offered as an alternative the refusal to make IPX work properly with Windows 95.  But Novell was gutless, all the
    same, and paid for its mistake.</p><p>There isn't enough room to document all the deals Microsoft made that marginalized its competition, so I'll
    leave it to students of history to recount them.  Put simply, nobody has ever walked away from a deal with Microsoft
    as a winner, at least not in the sense of a true winner or long-term winner.</p><p>I've drawn a comparison between Microsoft and Al Capone before.  The last time I did so, I quoted from the
    movie
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Untouchables</em></span> as to how to deal with Microsoft.  Malone (Sean Connery) says to Elliot Ness
    (Kevin Costner),
    &ldquo;Here's how you get Capone: he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  He sends one of yours to hospital, you send one
    of his to the morgue! That's the Chicago way! And that's how you get Capone.  Now, do you want to do that? Are you
    ready to do that?&rdquo;</p><p>The last time I quoted that passage in a column, Marc Andreesen wrote to tell me he taped that column to his
    bathroom mirror to remind him daily how to
    &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; with Microsoft.  I don't know if it did any good, but I hope it helped give Netscape the
    courage to go to the DOJ.</p><p>Some people are content with the Microsoft/Novell deal because Microsoft is going to promote SUSE, and Novell
    stands to make money from it, at least in the short term.  But when it comes to the story of Al Capone, whose praise
    do we sing? Do we honor as heroes the men who got rich taking bribes from Capone? Or do we honor as heroes the
    Untouchables, those who were not willing to profit from a deal with the devil?</p><p>To those who think the Microsoft/Novell deal is good for Novell and for Linux, I say let's revisit this issue
    in five years when the current deal expires.  I suspect the ulterior motives will surface before then, but if not, I
    predict those who praise Novell and/or Microsoft will be in for a rude awakening five years from now.  I hope I'm
    wrong, but if I'm right, I pray someone at Novell with some guts will post this column on his or her bathroom
    mirror before it is too late.</p></div></div>
