Gnull and Voyd</h4><p>
Just when I thought you could not possibly come up with a column more
irritating than Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s Cooking with Linux (full of useful
information embedded in silliness), you bring us Gnull and Voyd.
Give us the tech tips; please lose the trailer trash schtick.

Keep up the good work.  I enjoy your /var/opinion column, and I continue to

a better system administrator over the years, and I thank you for that.

Forgiveness</h4><p>
A few months ago, I wrote to you saying we had to break up&mdash;you had
become too chatty and opinion-filled for my taste.  I have to admit that
it turns out I was bluffing.  I love you too much, and today, I renewed
my subscription.
</p><p>
You did take a significant dip in quality, but things have gotten better
the last couple of months.  More important, though, is the fact
that you started from such a high-quality base that even when it dipped,
you were still the only Linux publication for me.

Breaking Numbers Down</h4><p>
I read with interest &ldquo;Breaking Numbers Down&rdquo; [Dave
Taylor's Work the Shell, <i  >LJ</i>, December 2006], having recently dealt
with this problem myself.  I believe bc is a generally overlooked,
but very powerful, UNIX utility.  Taylor's script nicely illustrates
the use of bc, and it is very useful for most purposes, but
unfortunately,
it doesn't scale well when dealing with the entire range of binary prefixes
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefixes" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefixes</a>).
</p><p>
First, the numeric test -lt used to find the first non-zero
{kilo|mega|giga}int fails with numbers larger than
2<sup  >73</sup>-1 (at least
on bash-3.0-8.2 running under kernel 2.6.8-24.25-smp).
</p><p>
Second, to extend this to deal with petabytes, exabytes, zettabytes
and yottabytes, a total of 16 calls to bc must be employed, with the
attendant overhead of shelling out to the system for each.
</p><p>
An alternative, which uses bc more efficiently and avoids testing a
number too large for shell, follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># total letters
nc=`echo -n $1 | wc -c`

# numeric letters
nn=`echo -n $1 | tr -cd '[0-9]' | wc -c`

if [ -z "$1" -o $nc -ne $nn ] ; then
   echo "Usage:  kmgp &lt;integer&gt;"
   echo "        where  0 &lt;= integer &lt;= (2^100)-1 "
   exit 1
fi

SIprefix=" KMGTPEZY" # kilo, mega, giga, tera, peta,
&#8618;exa, zetta, yotta

# what is the closest power of 1024?
# ( ln(1024)=6.93147180559945309417)
order=`echo "scale=0 ; 1 +
&#8618;l($1)/6.93147180559945309417" | bc -l`

# find the letter associated with this power of 1024
letter=`echo "$SIprefix" | cut -c $order`


if [ $nn -gt 3 ]
then scale=3
else scale=0
fi

value=`echo "scale=$scale ; $1/(1024 ^($order-1))"
&#8618;| bc -l`

echo "$value$letter"</pre><p>
This version contains two calls to bc and one to cut.
The calls to bc merit some discussion:
The first:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># what is the closest power of 1024?
# ( ln(1024)=6.93147180559945309417)
order=`echo "scale=0 ; 1 +
&#8618;l($1)/6.93147180559945309417" | bc -l`</pre><p>
determines the closest power of 2<sup  >10</sup> by using the fact that dividing a
logarithm by the logarithm of N is the same as taking its Nth root.
The offset by one compensates for the fact that cut is one-based, not
zero-based.  Note that we are loading bc's math libraries by using bc -l.
</p><p>
The second:</p><pre     class="programlisting">value=`echo "scale=$scale ;
&#8618;$1/(1024 ^($order-1))" | bc -l`</pre><p>
divides by 1024 raised to the correct order and scales to an appropriate
number of decimal places.
</p><p>
Averaging the time taken for both scripts on 400 arbitrary numbers, I
find that the logarithm-based script is a little more than three times
faster.  On the other hand, if numbers larger than several hundred
gigabytes are of no interest, the original script is faster.

Organized Repression</h4><p>
Your /var/opinion [January 2007] regarding the trade-offs between GPLs
versions 2
and 3, reminded me of a wry remark that's worth repeating: &ldquo;There's no
such thing as freedom&mdash;it's just a question of how the repression is
organised!&rdquo;

More Than Just Developers</h4><p>
You claim that &ldquo;the only people who are truly harmed by having the
software on ROM are the tiny minority of hackers who want to run
a modified version of the software on the gadget&rdquo; [January
2007 /var/opinion].  This statement
is false.  Hackers may be the only people whose goals are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>directly</em></span>
impeded by immutable embedded software.  But where does the software
created by hackers eventually trickle down to? The user, who would know
no more about the software than how to load it into the device and make
use of whatever enhanced features it provides.  The &ldquo;vast
majority&rdquo; of
users are harmed by the chilling effect on a &ldquo;tiny minority&rdquo; of capable
developers because they do not benefit from the software that otherwise
would have been developed.


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ryan Underwood  <br><br>
</p><p>
Point taken.  But if the source code is available, as it must be under
GPLv2, then developers can learn from it and use it, just not on a
particular device.  &mdash;Ed.

DocBook XML and CSS</h4><p>
David Lynch's November 2006 article on using DocBook XML to build
simple Web sites was timely for me.  For many years, I'd been writing
the documentation for my open-source projects in raw HTML, but I've
recently &ldquo;seen the light&rdquo; and now use a combination of DocBook XML and
CSS.  However, my deployment approach is quite different from David's.
Instead of relying on frames and the browser's ability to convert XML
to HTML&mdash;and suffer from the complications this brings&mdash;I simply
convert the DocBook XML to HTML off-line, then upload the output to my
Web site.  This is a much simpler approach that still preserves the key
advantages of DocBook.  I recommend it to anyone writing software manuals
or simple Web sites, looking for a clean split between content and
presentation.  For an example of how it's done, download the HR-XSL Project
(<a href="http://hr-xsl.sourceforge.net" target="_self">hr-xsl.sourceforge.net</a>), and look in the doc directory.

Ode to Joy</h4><p>
Jon Hall is making some extremely weak arguments against patents
[Beachhead, January 2007].  First
and foremost, the argument should not be <span   class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> we should have software
patents.  The argument should be on how software patents and patents
in general are implemented and maintained.
</p><p>
Although it may take me several years to come up with a completely
new operating system, it may take someone else only a few weeks or
months.  This does not mean that this new, novel operating system should
not be patented and protected so that big companies cannot steal it.
</p><p>
You see, to invent something, the inventor is usually intimately involved
in that field or research.  Sometimes the best ideas just appear out
of nowhere.  The idea itself may be easy or hard to implement, it may
require more or less time, but what matters in the end is the ingenuity
and usefulness.
</p><p>
This is one thing everyone who is complaining about patents is
missing.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Patents are there to protect the small guy.</em></span> It is not the
other way around.  It may look like that today, as the implementation and
enforcement of the patent laws may be unfortunate, but ultimately, the
idea behind a patent is to <span   class="emphasis"><em>protect</em></span> your invention.
</p><p>
Imagine a world with no copy protection, trademarks, patents or other
laws protecting ingenuity and uniqueness.  In a short period of time,
there would be no invention, no new music or works of art.  We would
see only repeats and same stuff over and over again.  There would be
no incentive to innovate.  It would simply not be a smart investment to
invest in invention.  That kind of world would be just terrible.
</p><p>
To some extent, this is already happening with software development.  Small
shareware developers that used to drive invention and put pressure on
big companies are now having very little reason to invent.  It is hard
to protect the invention, and if they don't protect it, someone bigger
will come along and take their market, or if that doesn't happen, a less usable,
but free version will be published.  Why invent? It's better to steal someone's
idea, hire some cheap labor and just put the money into marketing rather
than R&amp;D.
</p><p>
On a side note regarding the music and visual art comments Jon made: imagine
if I could copy <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ode to Joy</em></span>, then add two notes at the end of the piece
and claim it as my own.  If I could market it better and more strongly than the
original composer (Beethoven), who would be able to say who actually wrote
that piece of music in the first place (assuming I was living in the
same time period)?
</p><p>
More important, if that were to happen to Beethoven, would he be able
to write a single piece of music again without being afraid someone
will steal it? Would he write music at all?

Nebojsa Djogo  <br><br>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall replies:</b></span>
I agree entirely that &ldquo;big companies&rdquo; (or anyone else)
should not be able
to steal your work, but I disagree that software patents are the way to
make sure that doesn't happen.
</p><p>
Copyright, contract and licensing law were applied to software a long
time before software patents generally became coded into law in 1995.
People were protecting their software way before software patents were
generally available.
</p><p>
Regarding the big and small point&mdash;the small software creator does not have the money to
fight a software patent battle in court.  Witness the contest between
RIM and NTP recently, where three of NTP's four claimed patents were
overturned at a cost of millions of dollars in legal fees.  The fourth
one might have been overturned, but RIM and NTP decided to
&ldquo;settle&rdquo;.
The only people who won from this debacle were the lawyers.
</p><p>
I did not advocate a world without &ldquo;copy protection&rdquo;, only software
patents.  I (and most of the Free Software community) appreciate
copyrights, trademark and trade secret laws for the protection of
people's ingenuity.  Free Software relies on copyrights for its licensing.
</p><p>
Regarding the Beethoven scenario&mdash;Beethoven would have sued you for copyright
infringement and probably would have won in court.  But, he would not have been
able to block you from using a triplet, or some other
&ldquo;process&rdquo; of
writing music.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, patents are not foolproof in protecting an
invention.  Witness the issues around Alexander Graham Bell and Antonio
Meucci (<a href="http://www.italianhistorical.org/MeucciStory.htm" target="_self">www.italianhistorical.org/MeucciStory.htm</a>).
</p><p>
All Beethoven would have had to do was publish his symphony in any
public, dated document (a much simpler and less costly procedure than
a patent application), and it would have been protected by copyright law.
</p><p>
Thank you for writing your letter, but I stand my ground against software
patents.

Reuven's column in <i  >Linux Journal</i> is one of my

</p><a name="N0x217f580.0x2270570"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x217f580.0x2270570"></a>Myths?</h4><p>
I appreciated Paul McKenney's article explaining recent advancements
in real-time Linux [&ldquo;SMP and Embedded Real Time&rdquo;,
January 2007],
and I especially enjoyed the &ldquo;priority boost&rdquo; comic strip in Figure
13.  However, I was a bit disappointed at his attempts to dispel certain
&ldquo;myths&rdquo; about parallel and real-time programming.
</p><p>
In Myth #2, for instance, I was hoping for some insight as to why
parallel programming is not &ldquo;mind crushingly difficult&rdquo;.  Unfortunately,
Dr McKenney's explanation was nothing more than a declaration that
&ldquo;it
is really not all that hard&rdquo;.  Until I see a more substantial argument
to dispel this so-called myth, I'm inclined to believe that parallel
programming is in fact quite difficult.  To paraphrase Edward A.  Lee:
insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and expect the
results to be different; therefore, programmers of parallel systems must
be insane.
</p><p>
Also, in Myth #5, Dr McKenney is propagating a myth instead of
dispelling one.  He notes that as Web sites become spread across
multiple servers&mdash;load balancers, firewalls, database servers and so
on&mdash;the response time of each server must &ldquo;fall firmly into real-time
territory&rdquo;.  Here he equates &ldquo;real time&rdquo; with
&ldquo;real fast&rdquo;, which is such
a common myth, it probably should be at position #1 in his list.  In
fact, real-time systems are all about predictability, not speed, and
their design often sacrifices performance for predictability.  And yet,
Dr McKenney implies that moving Web servers to a real-time environment
will magically reduce their response times.  This is simply not
true.  The response time of a Web server goes up only in the presence of
overload&mdash;too many people hitting it at once&mdash;and when this happens,
a real-time Web server will fail just as easily as a non-real-time
server would.
</p><p>
I hope that any Web admins out there who have been inspired by
Dr McKenney's article will put down their copy of Ingo Molnar's real-time
preemption patch and forget about real-time Linux.  Simply adding another
server behind their load balancer will have a much greater impact in
improving overall response time&mdash;and require far less effort!

There is a mistake in David Lynch's January 2007 article &ldquo;How to Port
