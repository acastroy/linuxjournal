Total
    parts cost is about $500 US, which is competitive with PC/PCI-card based Asterisk solutions.  Embedded solutions
    have the advantage of small size, low power and no moving parts.  Figure 1 is a photo of the PBX hardware in
    action.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9348f1.large.jpg"><img src="9348f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1.  Digi-Key Blackfin STAMP Development Card</p></div></div><p>The PBX is built around a Blackfin STAMP development card, available off the shelf from Digi-Key for around
    $225 US.  The Blackfin is a powerful DSP chip that runs uClinux.  Sitting on top of the Blackfin STAMP card is a
    daughterboard, which contains interface hardware and the SD card socket.  Into the daughterboard plugs FXO or FXS
    modules, one for each port.  In this example, there are two FXS modules on the left and two FXO modules on the
    right.  The color of each LED indicates the type of module inserted.</p><p>Here's a brief review of telephony jargon:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>FXO ports connect to telephone lines and the exchange.</p></li><li><p>FXS ports connect to analog telephone handsets.</p></li></ul></div><p>Figure 2 is a block diagram of the PBX hardware and software components.  SIP phones or analog phones can be
    used for handsets (extensions), which are connected via a LAN to the IP PBX.  External calls can be routed over the
    Internet or through the analog FXO ports.  Internal calls between IP phones are routed over the LAN.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9348f2.large.jpg"><img src="9348f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2.  Sample PBX Configuration</p></div></div><p>The PBX supports most of the features of Asterisk running on an x86 PC.  As there is no hard disk, an SD card
    is used for voice-mail storage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166a80"></a>Why Port Asterisk to uClinux/Blackfin?</h2></div></div><p>I have a history of developing computer telephony hardware and have always wanted to build a small embedded
    box that combines a host processor, DSP, line interface hardware and software.  It's an itch I've needed to
    scratch!</p><p>There are some very cool things about the Blackfin processor chip:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The problem with most embedded processors is that they are not very powerful.  The Blackfin is a powerful
        host processor
        <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> a DSP&mdash;that is, it can run uClinux, Asterisk and codecs like G729 on the same
        processor at the same time.  A standard 500MHz Blackfin runs at around 1,000 DSP-MIPs, which is plenty for
        codecs, echo cancellation and so forth.</p></li><li><p>A lot of effort and hardware cost is usually required to interface telephony hardware to the host
        processor (typically a PC), such as PCI bridge chips.  The Blackfin makes it easy, as it has a lot of nice
        interfaces built in, such as serial ports, SPI and DMA controllers, which are all tightly integrated with the
        core processor.</p></li><li><p>The Blackfin chips are good value for the money, ranging from $4.95 US each (BF531 in 10k volume), which
        makes low-cost embedded telephony hardware a real possibility.  This makes it possible to build an IP PBX
        including analog or E1/T1 line interfaces for far less than comparable PC-PCI card solutions.</p></li><li><p>Best of all there is an Open Source community that has developed GPL hardware (the family of STAMP
        boards).</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2166f50"></a>Open-Source Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The hardware designs for this project are open&mdash;the schematics and PCB layouts are freely available for
    anyone to download, copy and modify.</p><p>The hardware designs have been released under the GPL.  Although there is some debate over how defensible the
    GPL is when applied to hardware, the key ideas are similar to open-source software&mdash;the hardware designs are
    free as in speech, and a community exists that is working together on extending and enhancing the designs.
    Intellectual Property (IP) is shared for the mutual benefit of all.</p><p>The community is loosely organised under the Free Telephony Project, and it consists of private hackers,
    researchers and several companies who are donating time and other resources to the project.  A series of hardware
    designs are being developed, for example, analog and ISDN interface hardware, and DSP motherboard designs.
    Significant software development work is also occurring, for example, open echo cancellation software and drivers
    for the hardware.</p><p>The outputs of the project are high-quality, professionally designed telephony hardware, freely available for
    all.  Hardware development is a little different from software&mdash;hardware design/test cycles are much longer
    (for example, a bug might mean a new board needs to be manufactured), and of course, it costs money to make a
    &ldquo;copy&rdquo; of a hardware design.  However, the benefits of open hardware are similar to open
    software:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Peer review is a wonderful way to trap bugs early, leading to big savings in development time.</p></li><li><p>Re-use of open designs enables innovative products to be developed quickly and with a very small number
        of bugs.</p></li><li><p>Discussion and contributions from people all over the world lead to a much higher-quality product than a
        product developed by one company in its own lab.</p></li><li><p>Using open hardware, an individual or small company can build sophisticated telephony products without
        needing large company resources.</p></li><li><p>The part I like best&mdash;you get to work with a community of talented hardware and software people!
        Some of the best and brightest minds out there seem to migrate naturally to open projects.</p></li></ul></div><p>Business models are being developed that function within the open-hardware environment.  For example, one
    company sponsoring our efforts has a service model based around low-cost telephony hardware&mdash;maintaining
    ownership of the hardware IP is not a critical part of its business plan.</p><p>Open hardware is also great for small, localised businesses and allows developing countries to build their
    own products locally&mdash;overcoming tariff barriers and building a local high-technology industry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2167630"></a>A
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>Really</em></span> Open Hardware/Software Project</h2></div></div><p>This PBX runs open-source software (Asterisk), on an open-source operating system (uClinux).  The operating
    system, drivers and applications are built using a GNU gcc toolchain.</p><p>The hardware designs are open and were designed using open-source tools.  Schematic entry was performed using
    gschem, and the PCB layouts were developed using a program called PCB&mdash;both included in the gEDA package of
    open electronic design tools.</p><p>Verilog was used to implement some programmable logic on the daughterboard.  Verilog is a language used to
    describe logic in electronic circuits.  The Verilog code was developed with Icarus Verilog, also part of the gEDA
    package.</p><p>Figure 3 shows the high-level work flow for the project.  As you can see, hardware, software and even the tool
    used to design the hardware are all open.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9348f3.large.jpg"><img src="9348f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3.  The Work Flow Used to Create the Project</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2167a50"></a>Assembling the Hardware</h2></div></div><p>Let's start putting it all together.</p><p>The first step is to plug your desired combination of modules in to the daughter card.  For example, for a
    home PBX, you might simply want one FXO and two FXS modules; for an office you might want four FXO modules.  In
    Figure 1, two FXO and two FXS modules are loaded.</p><p>The next step is to plug the daughter card/module assembly in to the Blackfin STAMP card.  That's pretty much
    it for the hardware assembly.  As a quick test, try applying power to the STAMP, and it should boot without any
    problems.  Not much else will happen yet, as we need to compile and download the software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x2167c08"></a>Building the Software</h2></div></div><p>The software is built on a Linux host PC, then downloaded to the Blackfin STAMP board using FTP (driven by
    some shell and Expect scripts).  Here are the steps:</p><p>Download and install the Blackfin gcc toolchain.  Detailed instructions for this step are on the
    <a href="http://blackfin.uclinux.org" target="_self">blackfin.uclinux.org</a> Web site.</p><p>You need a compiled version of the latest Blackfin STAMP uClinux distribution (uClinux-dist RPM or tarball).
    Before building it, set up the following configuration using
    <tt  >make menuconfig</tt>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Kernel hacking: boot param&mdash;
        <tt  >root=/dev/mtdblock0 rw</tt>.  This makes the root filesystem read-write, which allows us to
        add the many files Asterisk requires to the root filesystem.</p></li><li><p>Blackfin options: write back cache&mdash;this improves the speed of the DSP-intensive operations, such as
        the Speex codec, by about 10% per codec instance.</p></li><li><p>Customize vendor/user settings: Flash tools&mdash;MTD Utils is switched off, as it breaks the
        uClinux-dist compilation (at least on my machine).</p></li><li><p>I modified the file: uClinux-dist/vendors/AnalogDevices/BF537-STAMP/rc to set the hostname and enable
        dhcpcd.</p></li></ul></div><p>Generic instructions for building uClinux are included in the Blackfin uClinux-dist documentation.  Read these
    and build uClinux.  If your build was successful, a uClinux-dist/images directory will be created containing the
    uClinux images.</p><p>Download the uCasterisk tarball, then: </p><pre     class="programlisting">$ tar xvzf uCasterisk-0.1.6.tar.gz
$ cd uCasterisk-0.1.6
</pre><p>In the file .config, check that: </p><pre     class="programlisting">BR2_TOOLCHAIN_DIR="/opt/uClinux/bfin-uclinux/bin"

See the top-level Makefile for other useful
    options.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x215eee8"></a>Downloading and Testing</h2></div></div><p>Now, download Asterisk and all the support files to the Blackfin STAMP: </p><pre     class="programlisting">$ ./scripts/install_all stamp</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x215f048"></a></h2></div></div><p>where stamp is the hostname of your STAMP card.  There will be a few pauses as the drivers are installed, and
    the LEDs on the daughterboard should light indicating that the FXS/FXO modules have been auto-detected.</p><p>The next step is to configure Asterisk for your combination of FXO and FXS modules.  Asterisk configuration is
    a big subject and can be daunting for the beginner.  To help get started, some basic configuration files have been
    developed.</p><p>Let's assume for now that you have loaded two FXS modules and two FXO modules.  In that case, run: </p><pre     class="programlisting">$ ./scripts/config_2fxo2fxs stamp</pre><p>Now, you are ready to start Asterisk.  Use Telnet to open a console to the Blackfin STAMP: </p><pre     class="programlisting">$ /var/tmp/asterisk -vc</pre><p>A lot of text will flash by as Asterisk boots, but eventually, you should be greeted by the Asterisk CLI
    prompt: </p><pre     class="programlisting">Asterisk Event Logger restarted
Asterisk Ready.
*CLI&gt;
</pre><p>Plug a regular analog telephone in to one of the FXS ports (the FXS ports will have green LEDs).  Pick up the
    phone, and you will hear a dial tone.  Try dialing 2000, and you should hear the
    &ldquo;Congratulations, you have...&rdquo; welcome message.  You then can try dialing a few of the demo options and
    make some calls between extensions.</p><p>The above procedure needs to be performed every time you power down or reset the STAMP card.  For regular use,
    the PBX can boot Asterisk from the SD card; however, while experimenting, it is often more convenient to download
    from the host PC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x215f4c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Expect and Embedded Systems
      </b></p><p>Expect is an extension to Tcl that lets you automate console sessions.  I have found it to be very valuable
      for automating common steps in embedded systems work.</p><p>There are a couple of annoying problems with embedded system development:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>On a regular desktop system, you compile code and then run it on the same machine.  With an embedded
          system, you compile it on a host PC and then download to the host system&mdash;for example, using FTP or
          TFTP.  This extra step becomes tedious and can lead to silly mistakes, like forgetting to download the latest
          version.</p></li><li><p>A lot of embedded development work involves device driver work, which can mean frequent crashes.  During
          the development phase, embedded systems commonly use RAM-based filesystems, so a system crash or reset means
          you lose everything and must download all your software and config files all over again.</p></li></ol></div><p>Expect lets you automate all this.  For example, here is some Expect code to transfer a file via FTP to the
      target system: </p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/usr/local/bin/expect -f

set tarball [lindex $argv 0]
set target  [lindex $argv 1]

send "ftp $target\r"
expect "): "
send "root\r"
expect "Password:"
send "uClinux\r"
expect "ftp&gt; "
send "cd /var/tmp\r"
expect "ftp&gt; "
send "put $tarball\r"
expect "ftp&gt; "
send "quit\r"
</pre><p>It's as easy to write as it looks.  In only a few minutes, you can automate common tasks.  To run the script,
      simply type: </p><pre     class="programlisting">$ ./download tarball.tar.gz target</pre><p>where target is the hostname of the target system.</p><p>You even can use it to set up configuration files for you (Asterisk has a million of these): </p><pre     class="programlisting">spawn telnet $target
send "cd /var/tmp/ipkg/asterisk\r"
expect "&gt; "
send "cp -a etc/* /etc\r"
expect "&gt; "
send "exit\r"</pre><p>This example starts a Telnet session on the target and copies a bunch of files to /etc.</p><p>Expect can save you a lot of time in embedded systems work, closing the distance between embedded and
      regular desktop development.</p></div><p>The configuration files for Asterisk are the same as for x86 Asterisk.  Some useful files are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/etc/zaptel.conf: Zaptel driver configuration</p></li><li><p>/etc/asterisk/zapata.conf: more Zaptel configuration.</p></li><li><p>/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf: sets up dial plan for PBX.</p></li><li><p>/etc/asterisk/sip.conf: SIP phone configuration.</p></li></ul></div><p>These files can be edited with vi on the Blackfin, but remember that any configurations will be lost when the
    board is powered down or reset.  Permanent changes can be stored on the SD card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x215ffc0"></a>Further Work</h2></div></div><p>So, there you have the basic steps for building your own embedded Asterisk PBX.  Kits containing the
    daughterboards and modules are available from the author.  We are working on further development&mdash;for example,
    custom Blackfin hardware designed specifically for telephony work and other line interface cards, such as BRI-ISDN.
    It's an exciting project, with the novel feature of open hardware development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206e580.0x21600c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Resources
