Although Moore's Law drives up compute power, network speeds languish.  One
reason I moved to Santa Barbara in 2001 was that Internet connectivity
was much better here than in Silicon Valley, where I had lived for the
preceding 16 years.  Six years later, however, my connection speeds
in Santa Barbara are barely any better, and the costs have gone up.
Worse, the city appears to be a low-priority region for Verizon and Cox,
our local telco/cableco duopoly.  Although Verizon is rolling out fiber to
homes in dozens of communities around the country, Santa Barbara isn't
one of them.  And, although Cox is also rolling out higher-speed services,
Santa Barbara is smaller and farther away from Cox's Atlanta
headquarters than any other markets.</p><p>
And, we're not alone.  The same kind of story is happening in most
communities across the US.  This is why hundreds of those communities
are doing what Linux and open-source developers have done all along:
taking matters into their own hands, doing for themselves as individuals
and groups what proprietary businesses and industries can't or won't
do.  They're rolling their own infrastructure.</p><p>
That's why I've been taking part in a local citizen effort to build
infrastructure that the local duopoly can't or won't provide.  This has
involved lots of meetings and discussions&mdash;not only amongst ourselves,
but with local businesses, civic leaders, elected representatives,
infrastructure (fiber, wireless) deployment contractors and other folks,
including cable and phone company people.  We want something that works
for everybody; a new infrastructural tide that lifts all boats&mdash;like
Linux did, and still does.</p><p>
This is why our emphasis is more on fiber than on wireless.  We
want Net infrastructure that maximizes capacity for the longest possible
time, and for the largest number of people and locations&mdash;much as we
might be doing if the challenge were building roads or reservoirs.</p><p>
It's still early, and we're pioneering here, as are many other
communities.  To help gather useful thinking at this pioneering stage,
I've put together a FAQ for myself, and for anybody else who wants the
benefit of the same thinking.  Because much of this thinking is informed
by, and modeled on, the successful experiences of the Linux and Open
Source movements, I thought I'd share my FAQ draft here.</p><p>
Bear in mind that this is just thinking out loud at this point.  It's
provisional.  I offer it in hope that it's useful to other folks in other
towns who are trying to do the same kind of thing.  I also offer it in faith that
the smart readers of <i  >Linux Journal</i> will help myself and others think and
work our way to local Net infrastructure that favors everybody, and not
just incumbent carriers.</p><p>
So here goes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Q: Why does &lt;your town or region here&gt; need
fiber-optic Internet infrastructure?</b></span></p><p>
A: For the same reason it needs roads, water, waste treatment and
electricity.  The Internet is becoming a &ldquo;fifth utility&rdquo;, no less
essential than those other four.  Fiber-optic cabling is the best form of
&ldquo;pipe&rdquo; for carrying the Net.  It is also the most
&ldquo;green&rdquo; and has
enormous capacity.  One fiber optic pair can carry thousands&mdash;even
millions&mdash;of times more data than any form of copper wiring or any
form of wireless connection.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Why not do wireless infrastructure instead of fiber?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: Even wireless needs a fiber backbone.  We think it's essential to
bring the best connections to everybody.  We also can add lots of
wireless service on top of fiber infrastructure.  Even cities opting for
wireless build-outs require fiber backbones.  We want to make the Net's
maximum capacity available to everybody.  This requires bringing fiber
connections to homes, businesses, hospitals, libraries, government
offices and other fixed locations&mdash;or as close as we practically can.
After that we can easily add all the wireless or wired coverage we want.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Isn't the Internet just a service we already get from cable or phone
companies?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: No.  The Internet is not itself a &ldquo;service&rdquo;.  It's a means for
transporting data between devices anywhere&mdash;without regard for the
distance between them or the routes between them.  It also was designed
on &ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo; principles, which make the
&ldquo;middle&rdquo; of the network as
transparent, uncomplicated and cost-free as possible.</p><p>
The Internet is radically different from telephone, cable TV and other
networks optimized for a single purpose.  It exists to support whatever
anybody wants to build on it or use it for.  Its purpose is to maximize
support for a maximum variety of uses, while minimizing its own
intrinsic costs.  In this respect, it is a public utility like water,
roads, waste treatment and electric power.  The Internet cares no more
about how you use it than your electric outlets care what you plug in to
them or than your water faucet cares about whether you're washing
dishes or filling a cup.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: But aren't telephone and cable companies utilities as well?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: Yes, but they are also businesses, and they're designed originally for single
purposes.  Although the Net today is carried to our homes and businesses by
these two businesses, the relationship in the long run is the other way
around.  Telephony and video used to be analog services.  Now they are
only two among many other forms of data that the Net is capable of
transporting.  So in the long run, we need to see telephony and video as
two among a countless variety of businesses that are supported by the
Net.  And, we need to stop seeing the Net as gravy on top of telephone and cable
service.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Is Net infrastructure costly to deploy?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: The Internet itself is not inherently scarce&mdash;as are water,
electricity and roads.  Instead, the Internet was designed as a way to
remove distance between every connected device and the people who use
those devices.  There is no &ldquo;long distance&rdquo; to the Internet.  Once a device
is &ldquo;on&rdquo; the Net, it is zero distance from every other device in the
world that's also on the Net.  That's because the Net was designed so the
functional distance between any two keyboards in the world is no greater
than the distance between those keyboards and their screens.</p><p>
Meanwhile, the cost of digging trenches, pulling cable and other
expenses is far above zero.  But it is also far less than the cost of
building roads, water distribution and waste treatment infrastructures.
And in the long run, it is just as important as any of those.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Doesn't the Net cost money to maintain?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: Yes, it does.  But the maintenance costs are more like those for roads
than for
phone or cable TV.  Unless a town (or a county) wants to go into the
phone and TV businesses, the engineering and maintenance costs do not
have to be high.  But capable engineers and maintenance workers are
required, just as they are for other utilities.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Isn't the Internet service we get from telephone and cable companies
good enough? We have e-mail.  We can browse the Web.  We can do instant
messaging.  We can search on Google and buy stuff from Amazon.</b></span>
</p><p>
A: The phone and cable companies deserve credit for offering Internet
services and contributing to the expanded reach of the Net.  But it is
important to understand two things.  First, the Net is far more than just
an extra service provided by telephone and cable companies&mdash;even
though that's how those companies sell and bill for it.  Second, the
Internet is a third-priority offering for both telephone and cable
companies.  Right now telcos and cablecos are working much harder at
getting into each other's core businesses than they are at expanding
Internet services.  And, the Net is about much more than e-mail, searching
and browsing.  It is becoming an essential backbone for civilization
itself.  There are many public and private service needs that can be
served only by reliable high-capacity Net infrastructure.  Doctors can do
diagnostics and even surgery over distances.  Public safety services can
communicate and share data rapidly.  Businesses that deal in graphical
imagery, high-quality audio and moving pictures can produce and share
their work far more easily.  Most important, businesses and civic
activities of all kinds can be supported&mdash;not only the two incumbent
businesses that first brought the Net to our homes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Doesn't all this threaten telephone and cable companies?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: It doesn't have to, because there is nothing keeping telephone and
cable companies from also going into other businesses that are opened up
by a growing Internet.  In other words, there are benefits to incumbency
other than leveraging original business models.</p><p>
In fact, the Net offers enormous opportunities to telephone and cable
companies&mdash;opportunities to provide countless services in addition to
their traditional ones.  That's because there is no limit to what you can
do with the Net.  Telephone and cable companies have a head start, both
in existing facilities and existing relationships with thousands or
millions of customers.  Instead of being in one, two or three businesses
(the phone, cable and Net &ldquo;triple-play&rdquo; businesses they're in now),
these companies can offer an infinite variety of value-added services to
individuals and companies and organizations that use the Net.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Why do cities and counties need to build out Net infrastructure? Why
not let the marketplace take care of it?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: Unfortunately, the marketplace we have is not a free and open one.
Telephone and cable companies are captive to long-standing regulatory
environments that are changing very slowly.  Also, neither side has shown
much interest in putting Net build-out ahead of their core businesses.
Both telephone and cable operators have powerful lobbying forces in
Washington, DC, and at the state level as well, working to protect their
traditional businesses from the &ldquo;threat&rdquo; of Internet growth.  Giving them
exclusive rights to control Internet infrastructure and growth is a
guarantee that the going will be very slow.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Doesn't the federal government care?</b></span>
</p><p>
A:.  Not much.  Although the Internet was born in the US, neither our
federal government nor its protected communications duopoly have shown
much interest in the Net's development.  Nor has our government paid much
attention to how well the Internet supports and sustains economic
growth.  Other countries&mdash;Korea, Japan, Denmark, Netherlands and
France, for example&mdash;have encouraged Net build-out for most of the
last decade.  As a result, the US is now 11th in &ldquo;broadband&rdquo;
penetration.  By deciding to leave Net build-out to the monopolists who
feel threatened by it, our federal and state governments have assured
limits on our economic growth and have reduced our competitiveness in
the world marketplace.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: How have the carriers crippled our Internet service?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: The Internet was designed originally as a symmetrical system.  That
means the &ldquo;upstream&rdquo; and &ldquo;downstream&rdquo; speeds should be the same.  That's
the kind of Internet connectivity we find in universities and inside
large companies.  But it's not what the telephone and cable companies
provide to our homes and small businesses.  What we get is
asymmetrical&mdash;much higher downstream than upstream.  The reasons are not necessarily
bad ones.  Most of us consume far more data than we produce.  This is
especially true when we download large graphical files, watch a YouTube
video or listen to the live stream of a radio station over the Net.  The
carriers have optimized their systems for asymmetries between production
and consumption.</p><p>
The problem is, these asymmetrical lines relegate everybody to a
consumer role and prevent us from becoming producers as well.  This
limitation is compounded by what are called &ldquo;port
blockages&rdquo;.  This is
where our phone or cable company prevents us from setting up our own Web
server or running our own mail server.  Again, they have some good
reasons for blocking the ports on our computers that those services
could run on.  Spammers, for example, can take advantage of open mail
server ports on our computers.  But these port blockages also prevent all
types of uses, including the ability to set up home businesses of many
kinds.</p><p>
So, instead of, say, offering services that aid in the development of
small and home businesses, the carriers just shut off possibilities to
avoid hassles that might distract focus from their core phone and cable
TV businesses.</p><p>
There is also, in both the telephone and cable businesses, a traditional
high-charge orientation toward business customers.  If you're a business,
they want to charge you a lot more money for the same level of service
provided to &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; who produce nothing other than a monthly
payment.  The carriers will talk about providing a higher grade of
service for the money, but the costs are often so high that they drive
businesses away.  As a result, businesses don't take advantage of what the
Net has to offer.  They buy the lowest-price offering and stick to
browsing the Web and doing e-mail.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Isn't local infrastructure build-out a case of government competing
with private industry?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: No.  It's a case of citizens finding a way to do what a protected
duopoly cannot.  What we are doing is also not competitive.  We want to
open our new fiber infrastructure to use by anybody, including cable and
phone companies.  We have their interests at heart too.  By building out
pure Net infrastructure&mdash;rather than competing with cable TV and phone
systems&mdash;we are protecting and supporting their core businesses.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Isn't this different from what we're seeing in other cities that roll
out &ldquo;triple-play&rdquo; fiber systems?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: Yes, it is.  By just installing the &ldquo;transport&rdquo;, and leaving the
services up to other parties (including the phone and cable companies),
we are doing two things.  First, we're saving money by not getting into
businesses and facilities that actually cost a lot to start and
maintain.  Second, we are treating the Net as the simple utility it needs
to be.  As a city, we know how to maintain roads, water treatment and
waste facilities, and so on.  We also know how to support businesses
rather than compete with them.  That's what we are doing here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: What will it cost to bring fiber-optic cabling to homes and
businesses?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: We have estimates of up to $2,500 per &ldquo;drop&rdquo;&mdash;about the cost of a
big flat-screen TV (without the immediate and certain depreciation).  But
the cost of fiber-optic cabling itself is actually less in most cases
than the labor cost of burying it in the ground or hanging it from
poles.  There is much we can do to drive costs down for the city and to
make it easy for citizens to connect to the network as they need it.  For
example, we can require that conduit and fiber be put in the ground
everywhere a trench is dug.  We can hang fiber on poles first and work
out the individual drops later.  We can create a regulatory and
procedural environment that encourages citizens and local businesses to
build their own neighborhood fiber networks, which we can then connect
to our publicly or privately own owned &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; whenever they're
ready.  We would love to create an environment where local businesses do
much of the build out and make money in the process.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: If you're not selling phone and cable TV services, how are you going
to pay back the cost of installing the fiber cabling?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: We'll have to approach this the same way we approach building out any
new public infrastructure&mdash;just as we did when we built our water
systems, our waste treatment plants, our roads.  We need to think
creatively about this, but also take advantage of what we already know
about building utility infrastructure.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: What do you expect will be the economic benefits of this?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: We can begin to hint at those by looking back at what the Internet
has done for our lives, and our economies, over the last ten years or
more&mdash;and multiplying it by countless citizens and businesses that are
finally able to do what they want with a Net infrastructure that truly
supports it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Q: Are there any downsides to building this out?</b></span>
</p><p>
A: No.  And that's the real bottom line.</p></div></div>
