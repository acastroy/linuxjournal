    Between GPS satellites and the Australian Surveying and Land
    Information Group are eight Linux systems, which have been
    collecting data for the last year. Find out how they're set
    up and how they keep everything running.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb2580.0x1caa348"></a></h2></div></div><p>I was approached in September 1993 by
Martin Hendy at AUSLIG (Australian Surveying and Land Information
Group) to give him some information about Linux to see if it was
suitable for a large project they had underway.</p><p>After I showed him a couple of Linux systems and gave him a
rundown, he decided to go ahead, and the end result is that there
are now eight Linux boxes scattered around Australia, gathering
data on the Global Positioning System. The current systems are at
Darwin, Ceduna, Alice Springs, Mawson Base (Antarctica), Davis Base
(Antarctica), Casey Base (Antarctica), Macquarie Island, and
Hobart. More are planned for other parts of Australia.</p><p>The application is a data gathering one. The Linux boxes are
attached via serial ports to a &ldquo;TurboRogue&rdquo; satellite receiver
system, which monitors the 32-satellite Global Positioning System.
Data is downloaded from the satellites and stored in a 4MB
flashcard in the back of the TurboRogue, and from there it is
downloaded to the Linux systems. These systems store the data and
forward it to a base system in Canberra.</p><p>The monitoring of the GPS system is essential for accurate
surveying work. Some other countries (notably Canada) have set up
similar networks for the same purpose.</p><p>Some of the Linux systems are connected directly to AARNet
via Ethernet (yes, Antarctica is networked!) while others have 14.4
Kbps modems and download data via scheduled cron jobs, using the
<span   class="bold"><b>term</b></span> package. Even the machines on
the net have modems, as we can't absolutely rely on the network
link.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb2580.0x1caa608"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The Antarctic Linux systems are Digital 48633DX MT PCs with
8MB RAM. They have two 345MB IDE hard disks, with only one
electrically connected, (the other is identically configured as a
backup). They have one 1.44MB floppy drive and a spare floppy
(again, not connected). They have WD8013 Ethernet cards and
DataLink 14.4 Kbps modems.</p><p>The Linux systems for the other Australian sites are
rack-mounted &ldquo;clone&rdquo; PCs, for various reasons. They are identically
configured.</p><p>Each system has four serial ports, each on its own interrupt.
We achieved this by making some minor modifications to a cheap
2-port serial board we bought in Canberra. The more recently
installed systems have eight serial ports using two 4-port cards.
The extra serial lines allow for control of more equipment.</p><p>The other custom hardware is a &ldquo;rebooting module&rdquo; designed
and built by Anthony Wesley here in Canberra. It is a small box
that attaches to a serial port, a power lead and the reset line of
the computer. Basically, it expects a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; signal from the
computer every five minutes on the serial line, or else it &ldquo;presses
reset&rdquo; by shorting the reset line for 30 seconds. These boxes are
very rarely needed, but it's good to know that they are
there.</p><p>A process runs a script to check half a dozen things every
minute and outputs the &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; signal if they all pass.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb2580.0x1caa870"></a>The Software</h2></div></div><p>The systems originally ran 0.99pl12 with a few patches. I
chose this because I have found it stable for my own use. We have
upgraded (only rarely) when we needed particular features or bugs
fixed. One of the features of having the PCs running Linux (they
were considering DOS) is that we can completely replace the system
remotely, either via modem or the net.</p><p>Each hard disk has four partitions: a DOS partition with
their old software on it (just in case), two Linux root partitions
(identically configured), and a data partition (the bulk of the
disk).</p><p>The Linux root partitions are 20MB and are only half full!
Most of them are, in fact, taken up with things that are only
included &ldquo;just in case&rdquo;, like kernel sources, gcc, sources for the
TurboRogue controlling software and even Emacs 19.16 (to make life
a little easier).</p><p>I have designed the system to be very small. It is small
enough, in fact, that the whole system can operate from a single
1.44MB floppy if I leave out the &ldquo;optional extras&rdquo;. This is
achieved by having the whole of the /usr tree in a compressed tar
file which uncompresses onto a ramdisk on bootup, and having next
to nothing outside of /usr. The systems on the hard disk are
already uncompressed.</p><p>This means that in case of emergency we can tell the on-site
operators to insert one of the duplicate &ldquo;Emergency root disks&rdquo; and
we can operate the complete system remotely just from the floppy,
including disk-fixing tools like
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>e2fsck</b></span>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> is used to control the
regular downloading of data from the TurboRogue and transmitting
the data to Canberra. Checksums are used to ensure the data is
correctly transmitted, and it is re-transmitted if
necessary.</p><p>Since October 1993, when the first systems in Antarctica came
on-line, an enormous amount of data has flowed from the remote
systems to the main system here in Canberra. It is a great credit
to Linux that it has performed so well under difficult conditions.
Congratulations to Linus and all the Linux developers!</p></div></div>
