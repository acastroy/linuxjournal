    <i  >Linux Journal</i> mentioned to Andrew Tridgell that we wanted to
    interview him about his work with Samba, and he responded
    with this enlightening and entertaining account of the
    development of the Samba package, answering all the
    questions we had intended to ask before we could ask him.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c7580.0x18bf3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The need to get the mainstream PC
operating systems to talk amicably with Unix has been around for a
long time. Recently, yet another option has emerged which takes a
different tack from previous methods. I'm talking about SMB for
Unix.
</p><p>The dominant file-sharing protocol in the Unix world is NFS.
The dominant protocols in the DOS/Windows/NT worlds are Novell and
SMB. SMB is also known as LanManager, although LanManager is really
only one implementation among many.</p><p>If you want Unix to talk to DOS, so that they can share file
and print resources, then there are basically two choices. The
first is to make the PC look like a Unix box by getting it to talk
NFS. The second is to make the Unix box talk one of the PC
networking protocols.</p><p>The best choice for getting NFS on a PC is to run a PC Unix
such as Linux. This, however, is not a realistic option just yet
for many PC users. The alternative is to run an NFS client on the
PC. The problem with this approach is that the NFS protocol was
never designed with PCs in mind. The security, administration, and
general utility of PC-based NFS clients is far from ideal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c7580.0x18bf5b0"></a>Security ad nauseum</h2></div></div><p>Just realising that providing NFS service from a Unix box to
a PC allows the PC to handle the authentication should make any
sane system administrator &ldquo;go off his lunch&rdquo;. The NFS protocol
requires that the Unix box trust the PC completely. In some
implementations this is hidden behind the appearance of a &ldquo;login&rdquo;
procedure and password protection. Don't let it fool you. As I have
demonstrated on several occasions, any half-wit with access to the
PC's console can fool the Unix box into giving write access to just
about anyone's files, without the need for any passwords.</p><p>If that isn't enough, just try to administer a large bunch of
PCs running NFS clients. Nightmare!</p><p>So what about the other approach? Can you make a Unix box
talk one of the PC networking protocols? The short answer is yes.
Products have been around for some time for some Unix flavours to
talk to PCs on their own terms. The problem is that software
vendors realise that this is a very useful thing to be able to do,
and charge accordingly. There must be a better way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c7580.0x18bf768"></a>Samba</h2></div></div><p>There is a better way. Samba is a free implementation of the
SMB protocol for Unix. The SMB protocol is the native file- and
printer-sharing protocol for Windows for Workgroups, LanManager,
Windows NT and OS/2. The SMB protocol is an X/Open standard and is
in use on millions of PCs worldwide.</p><p>Before I tell you all about the current version of Samba and
what it can do for you, I'm going to indulge in a little history.
There is probably a similar history behind many other free software
packages. They all start somewhere.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c7580.0x18bf8c8"></a>Some History</h2></div></div><p>The whole thing really started in December 1991. I was (and
still am) a PhD student in the Computer Sciences Laboratory at the
Australian National University, in Canberra, Australia. We had just
acquired a beta copy of the PC X server
<span   class="emphasis"><em>eXcursion</em></span> from Digital, and I was testing it
on my PC. At this stage I was an MS-DOS user, dabbling in
windows.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>eXcursion</em></span> ran (at the time) only with
Dec's &ldquo;Pathworks&rdquo; network for DOS. I had until then been using
PC-NFS to connect to our local Sun workstations, and was reasonably
happy with it. In order to run Pathworks, I had to stop using
PC-NFS and try using Pathworks to mount disk space. Unfortunately,
Pathworks was only available for Digital workstations running VMS
or Ultrix, so I couldn't mount disk space from the Suns
anymore.</p><p>I had access to a DecStation 3100 running Ultrix that I used
to administer, and I got the crazy notion that the protocol that
Pathworks used to talk to Ultrix couldn't be that hard, and maybe I
could work it out. I had never written a network program before,
and certainly didn't know what a socket was.</p><p>In a few days, after looking at some example code for
sockets, I discovered it was pretty easy to write a program to
&ldquo;spy&rdquo; on the file sharing protocol. I wrote and installed this
program (the <b  >sockspy.c</b> program supplied with
Samba) and captured everything that the Pathworks client said to
the Pathworks server.</p><p>I then tried writing short C programs (using Turbo C under
DOS) to do simple file operations on the network drive (open, read,
cd, etc.) and looked at the packets that the server and client
exchanged. From this I worked out what some of the bytes in the
packets meant, and started to write my own program to do the same
thing on a Sun.</p><p>After a day or so more I had my first successes and actually
managed to get a connection and read a file. From there it was all
downhill, and a week later I was happily (if a little unreliably)
mounting disk space from a Sun to my PC running Pathworks. The
server code had a lot of &ldquo;magic&rdquo; values in it, which seemed to be
always present with the Ultrix server. It was not until two years
later that I found out what all these values meant.</p><p>I thought other people might be interested in what</p><p>I had done, so I asked a few people at uni, and no one seemed
much interested. I also spoke to a person at Digital in Canberra
(the person who had organised a beta test of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>eXcursion</em></span>) and asked if I could distribute
what I'd done, or if it was illegal. It was then that I first heard
the word &ldquo;netbios&rdquo;, when he told me that he thought it was all
covered by a spec of some sort (the netbios spec), and thus what
I'd done was not only legal, but silly.</p><p>I found the netbios spec after asking around a bit (the
RFC1001 and RFC1002 specs) and found that they looked nothing like
what I'd written, so I thought maybe the Digital person was
mistaken. I didn't realise that the RFCs referred to the name
negotiation and packet encapsulation over TCP/IP, and what I'd
written was really an SMB implementation.</p><p>Anyway, he encouraged me to release it, so I put out &ldquo;Server
0.1&rdquo; in January 1992. I got quite a good response from people
wanting to use Pathworks with non-Digital Unix workstations, and I
soon fixed a few bugs, and released &ldquo;Server 0.5&rdquo;, closely followed
by &ldquo;Server 1.0&rdquo;.</p><p>All three releases came out within about a month of each
other.</p><p>At this point I got an X-terminal on my desk, no longer
needed <span   class="emphasis"><em>eXcursion</em></span>, and promptly forgot about
the whole project, apart from a few people who e-mailed me
occasionally about it.</p><p>A year passed with just occasional e-mail asking about new
versions and bugs. I even added a note to the ftp site asking for a
volunteer to take over the code as I no longer used it. No one
volunteered.</p><p>During this time I did hear from a couple of people who said
it should be possible to use my code with LanManager, but I never
got any definite confirmation.</p><p>One e-mail message I got about the code did, however, make an
impression. It was from Dan Shearer at the University of South
Australia, and he said this:</p><p>I heard a hint about a free Pathworks server for Unix in the
Net channel of the Linux list. After quite a bit of chasing (and
lots of interested followups from other Linux people) I got hold of
a release news article from you, posted in Jan 92, from someone in
the UK.</p><p>Can you tell me what the latest status is? I think you might
suddenly find a whole lot of interested hackers in the Linux world
at least, which is a place where things tend to happen fast (and
even some reliable code gets written, BION!).</p><p>I asked him what Linux was, and he told me it was a free Unix
for PCs. This was in November 1992, and a few months later I was a
Linux convert! I still didn't need a Pathworks server, though, so I
didn't do the port, but I think Dan did.</p><p>At about this time I got e-mail from Digital, from a person
working on the DEC-Alpha software distribution. He asked if I would
mind if they included my server with the &ldquo;contributed&rdquo; CD-ROM. This
was a bit of a shock to me, as I never expected DEC to ask me if
they could use my code! I wrote back saying it was OK, but never
heard from him again. I don't know if it went on the CD-ROM.</p><p>Anyway, the next big event was in December 1993, when Dan
again sent me e-mail saying my server had &ldquo;raised its ugly head&rdquo; on
<b  >comp.protocols.tcpip.ibmpc</b>. I had a quick look
on the group, and was surprised to see that there were people
interested in this thing.</p><p>At this time a person from our computer center offered me a
couple of cheap ethernet cards (3c505s for $15 each) and
coincidentally someone announced on one of the Linux channels that
he had written a 3c505 driver for Linux. I bought the cards, hacked
the driver a little, and setup a home network between my wife's PC
and my Linux box. I then needed some way to connect the two, and I
didn't own PC-NFS at home, so I thought maybe my server could be
useful. On the newsgroup, among the discussions of my server,
someone had mentioned that there was a free client that might work
with my server that Microsoft had put up for ftp. I downloaded it
and found to my surprise that it worked first time with my
Pathworks server!</p><p>Well, I then did a bit of hacking, asked around a bit and
found (I think from Dan) that the spec I needed was for the &ldquo;SMB&rdquo;
protocol, and that it was available via ftp. I grabbed it and
started removing all those ugly constants from the code, now that
all was explained. It was a shock seeing the real spec for SMB, and
it made me realise how lucky I was that my original code worked at
all.</p><p><a href="2858s1.html" target="_self">Samba Resources</a></p><p>On December 1, 1993, I announced the start of the &ldquo;Netbios
for Unix&rdquo; project, seeding the mailing list with all the people who
had e-mailed me over the years asking about the server.</p><p>At this stage I called the package smb-server. This changed
quickly one weekend when I got e-mail from a company that makes a
commercial Unix SMB-based server. Apparently they have trademarked
that name. I needed a new name quickly, and Samba was born.</p><p>This list has now grown to over 600 people and a newsgroup
(<b  >comp.protocols.smb</b>) has just started, primarily
because of peoples' interest in Samba. I get approximately 100
connections to the Samba ftp site each day, and dozens of dedicated
hackers have contributed to the code. Samba is now being used as a
production PC file server at many sites worldwide.</p><p>Almost all of the development for Samba was done on my home
Linux box. Linux has been a fantastic development plaform. Without
Linux, Samba would certainly not be where it is today.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c7580.0x18c0580"></a>What Can It Do?</h2></div></div><p>Now that I've got that off my chest, I better tell you what
Samba can do. Not that I expect anyone to still be reading after a
tirade like that one.</p><p>Samba provides file and print services to SMB clients. These
include LanManager, Windows for Workgroups, Windows NT and OS/2.
There is also a free client for DOS put out by Microsoft, but it's
a real memory hog.</p><p>Samba also provides a Netbios name server, so PCs can find
the server, and a Unix SMB client program. The SMB client only has
a primitive ftp-like interface, but a proper mountable SMB
filesystem for Linux is in the works.</p><p>Samba uses quite a comprehensive configuration file mechanism
written by Karl Auer. Karl also did all the documentation for
Samba, which I think has been very important in its success.</p><p>Some features of the Samba server are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>freely distributible source under GPL</p></li><li><p>supports more than 20 flavours of Unix</p></li><li><p>easy configuration</p></li><li><p>supports mangled filenames with root name
preservation</p></li><li><p>much faster than NFS</p></li><li><p>much more secure than NFS</p></li><li><p>clients are pre-installed on many platforms</p></li><li><p>most clients have auto-reconnect</p></li><li><p>restrict access by username/password, by IP address
or netgroup</p></li></ul></div><p>There are a lot more bits and pieces. Samba has &ldquo;suffered&rdquo;
from Karl's code that allows me to easily add new options. There
are now more than 60 configurable options in the server, which can
be applied in endless combinations for each exported file or print
service. Thank god for Karl's man pages.</p><p>Samba is being improved all the time. It is now a distributed
development effort with many active contributors. Upcoming versions
are likely to include full long filename support for those clients
that can handle it (such as Windows NT and Chicago), browsing
support and a mountable SMB filesystem. Work is also proceeding on
a more complete RFC1001/1002 netbios nameserver
implementation.</p><p>Get it, use it. If it doesn't work for you, then remember how
much it cost. Also remember to send me a bug report.</p><p>Now I think I'll go and have some lunch.</p></div></div>
