in the latest issue of <i  >LJ</i>. I think what [he] said is true, but
misses a point Phil Hughes has alluded to in an earlier
editorial.</p><p>I think the reason that Linux; and free software in general;
is so great is that it's an incredible consumer value. According to
the dictum, &ldquo;what do you put in to it, what do you get out of it,
and what about support?&rdquo;, most commercial software falls right down
flat: it's expensive to buy, you often can't try it out in advance,
and if it's broke you're at the mercy of the vendor, who is the
only one with the source code.</p><p>If free software was free but you didn't get the source, it
would be terrible; you could try it in advance, but when it finally
did break, no doubt in the middle of an important project, you
would be stuck. On the other hand, if payware came with source
code, it would be a much better deal: when it broke, you could ask
the manufacturer to fix it, or you could call your local hacker and
negotiate a price based on how soon you need it fixed. Of course
even payware with sources still doesn't let you test it all in
advance of buying it, but it's a much better consumer value.</p><p>Consider the auto industry for a moment. It will cost you
about as much to service a car over its life as it cost to buy in
the first place. Would you pay double the price up front in order
to avoid paying for service down the road? Yet this is just what
software houses do, since the only way they can pay for customer
support is by charging more for the product. It's no wonder
software support is so lousy! This is why being able to hire your
own hacker is so important.</p><p>And thus a common point of confusion about free software: it
is free in the liberty sense, but it isn't free in the money sense,
since programmers have to eat just like everybody else. What free
software is is a much better deal. Even if you had to pay a little
bit for it, it would be a great deal. Imagine that you had to pay
Linus $1 every time you got a new major revision of Linux. Linux
would still be the best consumer bargain going. And, indeed, many
Linux users pay $40 and more for a convenient distribution.</p><p>And that, in my opinion, is what makes Linux great. It's
cheap to test drive, it is high quality, it's cheap to buy, and
when something breaks you can decide how much it's worth to you to
get it fixed, how fast, and you can get it fixed. What do you put
in to it? A few dollars. What do you get out of it?
Professional-quality software. What about support? The best.-

and Programming the VT Interface</em></span> columns in
<i  >LJ</i>. The notes on signal() were
welcomed.</p><p>There have been a number of columns connected with the
FSF+GNU. <i  >LJ</i> should add a few notes to these columns on ways to
support FSF and GNU. In your <span   class="emphasis"><em>GNU C Lib</em></span>
article, you wrote &ldquo;I do not know if [the reference manual] is
being published on paper&rdquo;. My copy of the GNU's Bulletin is at
school, but I think it is listed. In any case, I'd like to see <i  >LJ</i>
more explicitly mention support of FSF (although you did mention
FSF books in the sidebar).</p><p>Just to be completely clear: I'm not suggesting that <i  >LJ</i> &ldquo;beg&rdquo;
for money for FSF; only that <i  >LJ</i> help new users become familiar with
the project. (My only &ldquo;official&rdquo; connection with FSF is in support
of GNU awk. I receive no money from FSF.)</p><p>2. There is a common thread in <i  >LJ</i> and on newsgroups about the
&ldquo;free-ness&rdquo; of Linux (Deutsch's letter in #2, Kempen interview in
#3, Welsh's columns). Users forget (or are not aware of) the
importance of various projects in the success of Linux. <i  >LJ</i> could
educate users in future columns on GNU software, C-Kermit,
ghostscript, etc.&mdash;Darrel Hankersonhankedr@mail.auburn.edu</p><p><i  >LJ</i> Responds:</p><p>1. Read What's GNU for this month. While we won't run an
editorial like that every month, we definitely agree that the FSF
has played a key role in the development of Linux, and is worth
supporting.</p><p>2. We have published several tutorials. It is true that quite
a few have not been for FSF software, but that is probably because
FSF is better known than some of the smaller new utilities that
people express an interest in writing tutorials for. We encourage
people who are excited about some package they work with to send
e-mail to info@linuxjournal.com and discuss writing a tutorial for the
package.</p></div></div>
