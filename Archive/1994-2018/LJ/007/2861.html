    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x142f580.0x1527298"></a></h2></div></div><p>I was just flipping through back issues
of <i  >Linux Journal</i> looking for an idea for this column. What caught
my eye was the change in profile of <i  >Linux Journal</i> advertisers.
CD-ROM distributors such as InfoMagic, Trans-Ameritech and
Yggdrasil have been there from the beginning as have the systems
distributors like Fintronic and Promox. The only Linux application
that was advertised was Techplot from Amtec Engineering.
</p><p>Things are changing. We have seen press releases and
advertisements from hardware vendors (Cyclades communications
board, for example), and software vendors. While I expected
development software there is a whole new area where Linux is
becoming active: database software.</p><p>New products from Revolutionary Software, Infoflex, WorkGroup
Solutions, Poet Software and Ray Ontko &amp; Co. offer commercial
alternatives to Ingres and Postgres that come with many Linux
distributions.</p><p>Finally, trade shows are starting to recognize the potential
of Linux. <i  >Linux Journal</i> is sponsoring a 2-day Linux track at Open
Systems World. This puts Linux on an even keel with commercial
tracks on NT, SCO and Solaris at the same show. Hopefully this will
be a good chance for those of us in the Linux community to not just
rub shoulders with &ldquo;the commercial guys&rdquo; but also to show them what
we have to offer.</p><p>What does this mean? To me it means that Linux is well on its
way to the commercial market. Six issues from now I expect that I
will see ads and press releases for applications using the
databases that have recently appeared. End users probably won't be
asking &ldquo;is it Linux&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;is it Unix&rdquo; or &ldquo;is it Netware&rdquo; or &ldquo;is it
NT&rdquo;. What they want is a solution and if we can offer the solution
that works well we should get the market. And, the cost of Linux
gives us a serious advantage.</p></div></div>
