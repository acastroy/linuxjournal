    Now and then, Andy Tefft will tell us what he ahs been doing
    with his Linux system, which may give you some ideas for
    your own system. This month, he installs Mosaic and pays
    with a clone of the classic board game, Risk.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12cd580.0x13c5240"></a></h2></div></div><p>I admit it. I'm hooked on Mosaic. You
don't know what Mosaic is? Neither did I, until a few months ago.
Mosaic is perhaps the most well-known WWW browser, at least for X
and Microsoft Windows. (To find out more about WWW, see the article
by Bernie Thompson in <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue 3.)
</p><p>After getting Mosaic at work (with no actual Web access, but
to see how I could use it to display my own internal
documentation), I decided I wanted to install it at home. I don't
have Motif, which is required to compile Mosaic, but thankfully a
few people have put pre-compiled binaries of different types on
<b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b>
(<b  >/pub/Linux/system/Network/info-systems</b>).
Installation was easy; I just extracted the gzipped tar file,
copied the binary to a suitable location, and copied the
app-defaults file into a suitable location
(<b  >/usr/X386/lib/X11/app-defaults</b>). The
<b  >README</b> material from the source is also
included. This is not a small package; over 1MB for the Mosaic
binary on disk, and it uses nearly 2MB of RAM.</p><p>Now I can Mosaic over my PPP link from home. What fun!
Interestingly, I have found that the traffic it generates is not
too hard on the limited-bandwidth PPP link (except when loading
large images). For the net-impaired, there is also a version of
Mosaic which works over a term connection in the same directory on
sunsite.</p><p>In between Mosaic-ing (OK, it does get a little boring when
all you have to browse with your information browser is information
you created), I had a little time to try out Frisk-0.99a, a pretty
nice Risk clone by Elan Feingold
(<b  >elan@tasha.cheme.cornell.edu</b>). It is
multi-player and networked, so you at least have to have loopback
networking to be able to use it. Also, there is no computer
opponent, although two players can share one window and one screen.
It has a nice help facility, too. There is only one game style
supported, but there is a lot of potential to this one.</p></div></div>
