</p><p>In a letter to the Wine1 development team,</p><p>Bob Amstadt wrote:</p><p>For those of you that are curious....I arrived in Heidelburg
two nights before the Linux Congress. My first night was spent
sleeping (I know - boring). The next day around lunch we ran across
a handful of the other Linux developers. I made the mistake of not
recognizing Linus from his picture. Everyone had a good laugh when
I asked him what his name was.</p><p>That night all of the speakers met for dinner and beer. Lots
of beer was had by all (some more than others).</p><p>The next day was the first day of the Congress. Around 300
people were in attendence. Apparently, about the same number were
turned away because seating was limited. Linus gave the keynote
speech to open the festivities.</p><p>He was extremely well received by the audience.</p><p>We then split into two sections. In the morning I listened to
Remy Card, Stephen Tweedie and Theodore Ts'o talk about Linux
filesystem. Also, Eric Youngdale spoke about iBCS2. I must admit
that I am very excited about the iBCS2 work.</p><p>I led off the afternoon with a 45 minute talk about Wine. I
was extremely pleased with the audience response. People were quick
to cheer when I spoke of desire to be independent of Microsoft. I
was questioned numerous times about Win32. Also, later that same
evening I was offered a large sum of money to pay an intern to work
on Wine.... I was also lucky enough to demonstrate Wine using a PCI
bus computer. I assume it also had a Pentium because Wine was very
speedy (for a change :-) ).</p><p>The next day I presented a two-hour tutorial about using and
hacking Wine. This was given to a much smaller group of people. Ted
Ts'o followed with a two-hour discussion of Internet
security.</p><p>All-in-all things went very well. My hope is that I inspired
more support for our project.</p><p>There was some talk about holding another Congress next year
although it is purely speculation at this point....</p><p>In a letter to the iBCS22 development team,</p><p>Eric Youngdale wrote:I am now home (and a bit jet-lagged)
after having gotten back from Heidelberg (Note the time of this
post - I have been up for 3 hours now :-). All in all, the meeting
was an incredible success - there were 350 seats available and
these quickly sold out and they reportedly turned away another 300
people. All of the talks were standing-room only, and there is
already talk of another meeting next year in Berlin, though that is
still speculation.</p><p>This is not really related to iBCS2, but there was a beta
version of a Linux-native version of Maple on a machine that people
could try out. I have a handout that they were giving out, but it
is in German, so I cannot say that much about what they were
saying.</p><p>It is not obvious at all in the English- speaking world, but
a German computer user benefits from a much greater coverage of
Linux in the media. This month's issue of iX (a German Unix
magazine) has an article written by Drew about the PCI driver, and
an article by Bob Amstadt about Wine. I understand that they have
been running about one article a month for the past 6 months or so.
A second magazine, C't, has also been running about 1 article per
issue lately. In addition, there are a number of books
available.</p><p>I walked down the main pedestrian street in Heidelberg and
came across a store that sold computer stuff - in the front display
window, clearly visible from the street, there were 3 Linux books
plus the Yggdrasil CD-ROM. One of the books, written by Thomas Uhl
and Stephan Strobel, has been translated into English by Springer,
and will soon appear in the U.[S,K]. market. This book is a basic
introduction for the new user, so other more advanced books would
also be required for a new English-speaking user. The other two
German books for Linux were more advanced one contained a bunch of
man pages translated into German, and the other one had to do with
kernel internals.</p><p>Pictures were taken of the developers present, and are
included here. JPEG files should become available soon :-).</p><p>One thing that became clear fairly quickly was that there is
a lot of interest in iBCS2 within the user community. I gather that
a lot of people are trying binaries of one sort or another, and a
lot of these are never formally reported to us even if the binaries
work perfectly. Also, there was a machine set up with the demo
versions of both WP and Xess running this was the first time I had
seen either program.</p></div></div>

        <span   class="bold"><b>Bob Amstadt</b></span>
        graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of
        Technology in 1986 with a BS in both Electrical Engineering and
        Computer Science. For the past five years he has worked as an
        independent engineering consultant specializing in embedded control
        and communications systems. His first exposure to Linux was in
        December 1992 when he installed it on his e-mail server. He began
        work on Wine as a result of discussions on comp.os.linux in May and
        June of 1993.
