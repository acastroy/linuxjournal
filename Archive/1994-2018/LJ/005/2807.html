    Linux is based on the Unix operating system, but also
    features a number of unique and useful kernel features and
    application programs that often go beyond what is available
    under Unix. One little-known gem is &ldquo;dialog&rdquo;, a utility for

</p><p>by Jeff Tranter</p><p>If you have installed a recent version of the Slackware Linux
distribution, you've seen the professional-looking install process;
it was created using the dialog utility.</p><p>True to the Unix tradition of writing general-purpose tools
that work together, dialog allows creating text-based color dialog
boxes from any shell script language. It supports eight types of
dialogs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>yes/no boxes</p></li><li><p>menu boxes</p></li><li><p>input boxes</p></li><li><p>message boxes</p></li><li><p>text boxes</p></li><li><p>info boxes</p></li><li><p>checklist boxes</p></li><li><p>radiolist boxes</p></li></ul></div><p>Dialog is very easy to use. If you've got your keyboard
handy, here's a one-line example of a message box you can try.
(Note: The examples in this article assume you are running a
Bourne-compatible shell program such as GNU bash.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --title 'Message' --msgbox 'Hello, world!' 5 20
</pre><p>This example creates a message box with the title &ldquo;Message&rdquo;,
containing the greeting &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;. The box is 5 lines high
and 20 characters wide, with the message nicely centered in the
box. An &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button appears at the bottom; pressing &lt;enter&gt;
dismisses the menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x204e580.0x2146d40"></a>Dialog Box Types</h2></div></div><p>Most calls to dialog are in a similar format: an optional
title, the dialog type, the text to be displayed, and the height
and width (in characters) of the dialog box. Additional parameters
specific to each menu type follow. Let's have a brief look at each
of the available types.</p><p>The &ldquo;yesno&rdquo; menu is very similar to our first example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --title "Message"  --yesno "Are you having\ fun?" 6 25
</pre><p>If you try this example, you will see that there are now two
buttons at the bottom, labeled &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;. You can select
between the buttons using the cursor keys (or &lt;tab&gt;) and make
your selection by pressing &lt;enter&gt;. The exit status returned
to the shell will be 0 if &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is chosen and 1 if a &ldquo;No&rdquo; selection
is made.</p><p>You may wish to try experimenting with the height and width
parameters. If the width is less than the string length, the string
is wrapped around (at word boundaries). If you make the dialog box
too small, then characters will be lost.</p><p>We previously saw the message box. The &ldquo;infobox&rdquo; is similar
except that it does not wait for the user to select an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button.
This is useful for displaying a message while an operation is going
on. Here is an example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --infobox "Please wait" 10 30 ; sleep 4
</pre><p>The &ldquo;inputbox&rdquo; allows a user to enter a string. The usual
editing keys can be used, and the text field scrolls if necessary.
After the user enters the data, it is written to standard error (or
more commonly redirected to a file as in this example):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --inputbox "Enter your name:" 8 40 2&gt;answer
</pre><p>The &ldquo;textbox&rdquo; type is a simple file viewer; it takes a
filename as a parameter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --textbox /etc/profile 22 70
</pre><p>The usual movement keys work here: the cursor keys, Page Up,
Page Down, Home, etc. You can exit by pressing &lt;esc&gt; or
&lt;enter&gt;.</p><p>The &ldquo;menu&rdquo; type allows creating a menu of choices from which
the user can choose. The format is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --menu &lt;text&gt; &lt;height&gt; &lt;width&gt;
&lt;menu-height&gt; [&lt;tag&gt;&lt;item&gt;]
</pre><p>Each menu entry consists of a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; string and an associated
&ldquo;item&rdquo; string, both of which are displayed. The user can make a
choice using the cursor keys and pressing &lt;enter&gt;. The
selected tag is written to standard error. Here is a simple
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --menu "Choose one:" 10 30 3 1 red 2 green\ 3 blue
</pre><p>The next type is the &ldquo;checklist&rdquo;. The user is presented with
a list of choices and can toggle each one on or off individually
using the space bar:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --checklist "Choose toppings:" 10 40 3 \
        1 Cheese on \
        2 "Tomato Sauce" on \
        3 Anchovies off
</pre><p>The third field in each choice is the initial state; -either
&ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off&rdquo;. The last type is the &ldquo;radiolist&rdquo;, essentially the
same as the checklist except that the user must make one choice
from a list of mutually exclusive options. The radiolist type, and
the alternate form of title show here, were introduced in version
0.4 of dialog.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% dialog --backtitle "CPU Selection" \
  --radiolist "Select CPU type:" 10 40 4 \
        1 386SX off \
        2 386DX on \
        3 486SX off \
        4 486DX off
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x204e580.0x21474d0"></a>A Real Application</h2></div></div><p>The preceding examples were somewhat unrealistic; dialog is
normally used within a shell script to do some real work. Let's
look at a simple but useful application. I use the following script
to back up my home directory to floppy disk on a regular
basis:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# Backup all files under home directory to a single # floppy
# Display message with option to cancel
dialog --title "Backup" --msgbox "Time for backup \ of home directory. \
Insert formatted 3-1/2\" floppy and press &lt;Enter&gt; \ to start backup or \
&lt;Esc&gt; to cancel." 10 50
# Return status of non-zero indicates cancel
if [ "$?" != "0" ]
then
  dialog --title "Backup" --msgbox "Backup was \ canceled at your
  request." 10 50
else
  dialog --title "Backup" --infobox "Backup in \ process..." 10 50
  cd ~
  # Backup using tar; redirect any errors to a
  # temporary file
  # For multi-disk support, you can use the
  # -M option to tar
  tar -czf /dev/fd1 . &gt;|/tmp/ERRORS$$ 2&gt;&amp;1
  # zero status indicates backup was successful
  if [ "$?" = "0" ]
    then
    dialog --title "Backup" --msgbox "Backup \
completed successfully." 10 50
    # Mark script with current date and time
    touch ~/.backup
  else
    # Backup failed, display error log
    dialog --title "Backup" --msgbox "Backup failed \ -- Press
&lt;Enter&gt;
    to see error log." 10 50
   dialog --title "Error Log" --textbox /tmp/ERRORS$$ 22 72
  fi
fi
rm -f /tmp/ERRORS$$
clear
</pre><p>To run this automatically, I put these lines in my .profile
file to call the backup script on login if more than 3 days has
elapsed since the last backup was made:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# do a backup if enough time has elapsed
find ~/.backup -mtime +3 -exec ~/.backup \;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x204e580.0x21476e0"></a>A Longer Example</h2></div></div><p>The sound driver for the Linux kernel uses a program called
&ldquo;configure&rdquo; to prompt the user for sound configuration options. It
generates a C header file based on the chosen options. A
replacement based on dialog could offer some advantages, such as a
more professional appearance and the ability to select options
randomly from menus rather than as a linear sequence of
questions.</p><p>Due to time and space constraints, I only present a partial
(but functional) implementation of a sound driver configuration
script. This could quite easily be extended to fully replace the
current configure program.</p><p>The complete script is shown in as Listing 1. I'd like to
explain it using a top down approach, which means reading the
listing starting from the bottom.</p><p>The last part of the script is a while loop which simply
calls the shell function main_menu repeatedly. Above that is the
code to implement the main menu. We present the user with three
choices, and redirect the selection to a file. One of three shell
functions is then called, based on the user's choice.</p><p>The most important menu in this script is the next one, the
config_menu function. Again we present the user with a number of
choices. Note that in this case there is an option which returns
the user back to the main menu.</p><p>Continuing to read our listing backwards, we come to the
select_cards function. The kernel supports multiple sound cards, so
here we use a checklist to present the user with the available
choices. The command &ldquo;on_off&rdquo; is a utility function that will be
shown later; it returns the string &ldquo;on&rdquo; if its parameters are
equal, otherwise it returns &ldquo;off&rdquo;. This is the form that the
checklist menu requires. Note that the return status of the command
is checked. If the user selects &ldquo;cancel&rdquo; from the menu then the
return status is non-zero and we return immediately without making
any changes. Otherwise, we set appropriate variables to indicate
which sound cards have been enabled.</p><p>The next function, as we read our listing backwards, it the
function view_summary. This uses the textbox type to display a file
containing information on the currently selected options. We first
build up the data in the file before displaying it.</p><p>Our next function is select_dma. Here the user must make one
of four mutually exclusive options, so we use the a radio list. If
you try this example yourself, be aware that the radiolist type was
added in dialog version 0.4; if you have an older version then you
will have to make do with a checklist.</p><p><a href="2807s1.html" target="_self">Availability</a></p><p>Up above, the routine select_irq uses very similar code to
allow the user to select the final option in our configuration
utility.</p><p>The purpose of this script is to generate a C language header
file defining the compile options for the kernel sound driver. The
&ldquo;save&rdquo; function does this. Notice how a dialog box is displayed
while the save is in progress.</p><p>Above that we see the on_off function alluded to previously.
This avoids some repetitive code in the script.</p><p>Finally, we see the clean_up routine which allows the user to
exit from the script. At the top of the script some default values
are defined for the configuration options and the temporary
filename to use.</p><p>The configuration utility still needs a few enhancements to
replace the existing program, including more kernel options and
error checking, but the example does function and gives a feel for
what can be done with dialog. I encourage you to type it in and try
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x204e580.0x2147cb8"></a>Advanced Features</h2></div></div><p>There are several more things that dialog can do. You can
create and use a dialogrc file to customize the color and
appearance of the dialog boxes. Dialog also supports displays that
do not provide color or graphics characters. The details are given
in the man page.</p><p>Dialog is &ldquo;8-bit clean&rdquo;, meaning that that international
character sets other than the standard US ASCII are
supported.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x204e580.0x213e6a8"></a>More Applications</h2></div></div><p>For some longer examples of using dialog you can look at the
sample scripts included with the dialog source code. Under
Slackware Linux, the system configuration scripts can be found in
/usr/lib/setup.</p><p>There are undoubtedly many possible uses for dialog. You
could, for example, create a fully menu-driven interface for Linux
users not familiar with shell commands. This could even be expanded
into a simple bulletin board system that allowed users to read mail
and Usenet news, edit files, etc.</p><p>The example sound driver script could be expanded into a tool
for configuring all of the kernel compile options.</p><p>Incidently, dialog is reasonably portable and should run with
minimal changes on any Unix-compatible system that has a curses
library. It can also be used from any shell script language.</p><p><a href="2807l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sound Driver

tradition of making each tool do one thing well. It can add a
polished look to your applications and make them easier to
use.</p><p>Thank you to Savio Lam, the author of the dialog package,
Stuart Herbert, who updated dialog to version 0.4, and Patrick
Volkerding, who wrote the dialog-based setup scripts in the
Slackware Linux distribution.</p></div></div>
