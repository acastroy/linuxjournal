implements standard I/O (stdio) in a somewhat strange way.
Unfortunately, many programs make unwarranted assumptions about how
stdio is implemented that cause the programs not to compile
properly under Linux. I have alluded to this problem before in this
column; this month I will explain how to fix such source code to
compile under any operating system, including Linux.</p><p>by Michael K. Johnson</p><p>Linux stdio is not exactly non-standard; that would imply
that there is a real standard for how standard I/O is supposed to
be implemented. Theoretically, all I/O operations that use the
stdio library should only use the &ldquo;published&rdquo; FILE mechanisms,
which are abstract, and should not pay any attention to details.
Unfortunately, many stdio implementations are rather slow, and do
not provide functionality that programs need.</p><p>Instead of writing a working replacement for stdio, many
programmers chose to abuse the stdio interface by directly
accessing &ldquo;private&rdquo; members of the FILE structure that are not
guaranteed to be the same from system to system. In practice, this
worked very well from system to system, because almost all the
systems came from the same source and a prototype using the same
variable names was widely available.</p><p>Programmers learned, for instance, that the _cnt member of
the FILE structure contained the number of bytes which had been
read by the library but not yet read by the application, and that
the _ptr member contained a pointer to the buffer in which the
characters that had been pre-fetched by the library were stored. It
was general knowlege that behind the scenes, the _filbuf()
(sometimes called _ _filbuf() ) macro was called to cause the stdio
library to read more characters.</p><p>This worked as long as everyone used similar stdio
implementations. Many well-respected applications used these
methods to get around stdio; GNU emacs and the Rand MH mail handler
are among them.</p><p>Linux is different.</p><p>The Linux stdio is based on the GNU libg++ iostream I/O. The
FILE structure looks, in part, like this (from libio.h):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int _flags;          /* High-order word is
_IO_MAGIC; rest is flags. */
#define _IO_file_flags _flags
char* _IO_read_ptr;   /* Current read pointer */
char* _IO_read_end;   /* End of get area. */
char* _IO_read_base;   /* Start of putback+get area. */
char* _IO_write_base; /* Start of put area. */
char* _IO_write_ptr;  /* Current put pointer. */
char* _IO_write_end;  /* End of put area. */
char* _IO_buf_base;   /* Start of reserve area. */
char* _IO_buf_end;    /* End of reserve area. */
</pre><p>This isn't at all the same. It is better optimized: instead
of having one _ptr element, it has one pointer for reading, and one
for writing, and a buffer for each as well. Instead of keeping
track of the number of characters in the buffer, a pointer to the
end of each buffer is kept, as well as the curernt pointer. It
makes it easier to use all sorts of things as files, including
shared memory, SYSV IPC, and anything else that fits the paradigm;
it is dynamically extensible. It is also shared between C++ and C,
and makes the C++ iostream implementation more robust because of
the extra testing it gets as a standard io package.</p><p>If you have worked with the Linux or GNU C libraries in the
past, you will notice that the names have changed. They used to be
shorter names like _pbase and _pptr that looked like they were
related to the old stdio names. In November 1993, the names were
changed to what you see above. It is not anticipated that these
will change again in the foreseeable future. See the sidebar &ldquo;Old
Names to New&rdquo; for a listing of how the names changed.</p><p>Replacing direct access to the members of the FILE structure
with abstract macros can make it possible to compile offending
source on any system. Since the Linux stdio makes a distinction
between reading and writing, the first thing to determine is
whether each code fragment is reading or writing. Then you replace
the direct use of the members of the FILE structure with macros;
ones that are specific to reading an writing. Finally, you write
the macros; one set for Linux, and one set for &ldquo;standard&rdquo; stdio.
Here are some of mine:</p><p><a href="2811t1.html" target="_self">Old Names to New</a></p><p>Under Linux or other similar stdio implementation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef _STDIO_USES_IOSTREAM /* defined in libio.h */
#define FWptr(f) ((f)-&gt;_IO_write_ptr)
#define FRptr(f) ((f)-&gt;_IO_read_ptr)
#define Fptr(f)  (((f)-&gt;_IO_file_flags &amp;&amp;    \
                      _IO_CURRENTLY_PUTTING) ?  \
                  FWptr(f) :    \
                  FRptr(f))
#define FWcnt(f) (((f)-&gt;_IO_write_end - \
                  (f)-&gt;_IO-write_ptr) &gt; 0 ? 0 : \
                  (f)-&gt;_IO_write_end - (f)-&gt;      \
                       _IO_write_ctr)
#define FRcnt(f) (((f)-&gt;_IO_read_end -       \
                  (f)-&gt;_IO_read_ptr) &gt; 0 ? 0 :       \
                  (f)-&gt;_IO_read_end - (f)-&gt;       \
                       _IO_read_ctr)
#define Fcnt(f)  (((f)-&gt;_IO_file_flags &amp;&amp;    \
                      _IO_CURRENTLY_PUTTING) ?  \
                  FWcnt(f) :    \
                  FRcnt(f))
#define Ffill(f) __underflow(f)
#define Fflsh(f) __overflow(f)
</pre><p>Under &ldquo;standard&rdquo; stdio:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#else /* standard stdio */
#define Fptr(f)  ((f)-&gt;_ptr)
#define FWptr(f) Fptr(f)
#define FRptr(f) Fptr(f)
#define Fcnt(f)  ((f)-&gt;_cnt)
#define FWcnt(f) Fcnt(f)
#define FRcnt(f) Fcnt(f)
#define Ffill(f) _filbuf(f)
#define Fflsh(f) _flsbuf(f)
#endif
</pre><p>Note that some code may use <b  >f-&gt;_cnt</b> as
an lvalue (a variable to which something is assigned). In these
cases, <b  >f-&gt;_ptr</b> will always also be assigned
to; both need to be updated at the same time in the standard stdio
library. Since the &ldquo;count&rdquo; values in these abstraction macros are
calculations for iostream-based stdio, they cannot be lvalues.
However, since they depend on the &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; values and the &ldquo;end&rdquo;
values, and the &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; values are updated, and the end" values
don't change, they do not need to have the updated values assigned
to them. Therefore,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
f-&gt;_ptr++;
f-&gt;_cnt; ;
</pre><p>becomes (assuming that the code is reading using this
pointer):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FRptr(f)++;
#ifndef _STDIO_USES_IOSTREAM
FRcnt(f); ;
#endif
</pre><p>or simply</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Fptr(f)++;
#ifndef _STDIO_USES_IOSTREAM
Fcnt(f); ;
#endif
</pre><p>if you are not sure whether the code is reading or
writing.</p><p>I will warn you: trying to apply these instructions and
macros to code you are porting without understanding the code you
are working on is likely to be disastrous. Your application may
compile, but quietly lose data if you put the wrong macros in. It
is most important not to use the <b  >FR*()</b> macros
when the library is writing, and not to use the
<b  >FW*()</b> macros when the library is reading. If you
can't tell which is being done, you are far better off using the
generic versions, <b  >Fptr()</b> and
<b  >Fcnt()</b>, than you are guessing.</p><p>There are other mistakes waiting to be made, and I can't
cover them all, because I don't know what they all are. The source
code to the Linux C libary is available via ftp from tsx-11.mit.edu
and sunsite.unc.edu, and is distributed with many Linux
distributions. Reading the libc source code (usually found in
/usr/src/libc-linux/libio/), and understanding what it is doing, is
the safest route to knowing what to do when porting code that makes
assump-tions about stdio. This article alone can only help you
along your way; you will still have to understand the program you
are porting and the Linux stdio to achieve success.</p></div></div>
