    Frustrated with Emacs? Here's how to wrestle it into
    submission.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27de3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you're like me, you find Emacs
somewhat intimidating. Well, if you're like me, you've been an
exclusive <b  >vi</b> user for years, and have always
wanted to start using Emacs, but have had trouble doing so. Each
time you try to switch over, you find yourself pressing &lt;esc&gt;
after every third sentence, which (in Emacs) produces some random,
and usually undesirable, result. Once, I was thrown into the
infamous &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; mode, which is a simple AI program emulating a
psychiatrist. There, I spent a good ten minutes telling Emacs what
I thought of it. (The response was, <b  >"Perhaps you could try
to be less abusive."</b>)
</p><p>Using one of Emacs' <b  >vi</b>-emulation modes
isn't of much help, either; none of them seem to handle even basic
vi commands appropriately. And if you tend to use less-well-known
vi features, you're simply out of luck. (Ever try changing the
window size with <span   class="emphasis"><em>nnnzwww^</em></span>? I didn't think
so.)</p><p>As impossible as it may seem, you can find a place for Emacs
in your everyday life. If you have the diskspace and memory (a
far-from-negligible detail), I strongly suggest looking into Emacs;
it can make your life easier, even if you think that you're
perfectly content with <b  >vi</b>.</p><p>Whether you're accustomed to vi or not, however, the default
Emacs configuration on many systems is, well, less than adequate.
While many users learn to live with Emacs &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;, I've
never been content with that approach. Instead, you can get Emacs
to do just about whatever you want it to do. So, let's take a look
at some customizations that I've found particularly useful.</p><p>All of the customizations discussed here involve editing the
Emacs configuration file, which is <b  >~/.emacs</b> by
default. This file is written in Emacs LISP (Elisp), which is the
internal LISP engine that Emacs uses for nearly everything. For
example, keystrokes map to Emacs LISP commands. You can modify the
command to be executed for each key sequence, and even write your
own Elisp functions to bind to keys.</p><p>If you're not a LISP programmer, never fear. Most of the LISP
forms described here are quite simple and don't require a degree in
artificial intelligence to comprehend.</p><p>I do assume that you have at least tried to use Emacs, and
know how to get into and out of it, are familiar with the Info
documentation system, and so on. If not, fire up Emacs and type
<b  >Ctrl-h (C-h)</b> followed by t, which will drop you
into a tutorial. (From there, you're on your own.) The following
customizations work under Emacs 19.24. By the time you read this
article, there will more than likely be a newer version available,
for which certain things may have changed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27de920"></a>Basics: Rebinding keys</h2></div></div><p>Before we can customize Emacs, we need a customization file.
By default this is <b  >.emacs</b> in your home
directory. (Later, we're going to move the contents of
<b  >.emacs</b> to another file, so buckle your
seatbelt.)</p><p>Our first task is to rebind several keys to perform more
reasonable actions. Admittedly, several of these key bindings are
vi-oriented, but should make sense nonetheless. First of all, I
like to page back and forth through the document with
<b  >C-f</b> and <b  >C-b</b>, as in
<b  >vi</b>. In order to rebind these keys, we'd include
these lines in our <b  >.emacs</b> file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
; Modify meaning of C-f and C-b
(global-set-key "\C-f" 'scroll-up)
(global-set-key "\C-b" 'scroll-down)
</pre><p>As you can see, comments in Elisp begin with a semicolon and
extend to the end of the line. Here, we invoke the function
<b  >global-set-key</b> twice; once for
<b  >C-f</b> and again for <b  >C-b</b>. In
LISP, expressions are parenthesized. The first item in each list is
the name of the function to call, and it is followed by any
arguments. The first argument to <b  >global-set-key</b>
is a string constant, representing the key sequence to bind. The
second argument is the name of the Emacs LISP function to bind it
to. The function name is single-quoted in order to refer to the
function name itself, not the function that it points to.</p><p>One question remains: How did we know that
<b  >scroll-up</b> and <b  >scroll-down</b>
referred to the Emacs functions to scroll pagewise through the
document? Other than reading the documentation, you could find this
out by using the Emacs function <b  >describe-key</b>
(which you can invoke with <b  >C-h k</b>). Calling this
function and following it with a key sequence will tell you the
Emacs function name that the key sequence maps to. If you knew that
the Emacs keys <b  >C-v</b> and <b  >M-v</b>
(<b  >Meta-v</b>, where &ldquo;meta&rdquo; is usually the &lt;esc&gt;
key) scrolled back and forth through the document, you could use
<b  >C-h k</b> to determine the function names for these
keys. For example, the sequence <b  >C-h k C-v</b> will
display the function name bound to <b  >C-v</b>.</p><p>Here are a few more key rebindings that I use often:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(global-set-key "\C-v" 'end-of-buffer)
(global-set-key "\M-v" 'beginning-of-buffer)
(global-set-key "\C-p" 'yank)
(global-set-key "\C-u" 'undo)
(global-set-key "\C-r" 'overwrite-mode)
</pre><p>The first two commands rebind <b  >C-v</b> and
<b  >M-v</b> (which previously scrolled by pages) to move
to the beginning and end of the buffer, respectively. The third
causes <b  >C-p</b> to yank the previously deleted or
copied region of text, and the fourth causes <b  >C-u</b>
to execute the undo command. (I tend to use the Emacs' undo feature
quite a bit, and find <b  >C-x u</b> or <b  >C-_
too</b> cumbersome.) The last command causes
<b  >C-r</b> to toggle overwrite mode.</p><p>There are some caveats associated with rebinding keys in this
manner. For one thing, it destroys the previous definition of the
key. In many cases, this is fine; as long as you didn't use the key
as previously defined. However, the last of the above commands
rebinds <b  >C-r</b>, which is used to invoke a backwards
incremental search; a very useful feature. Before rebinding a key
you should be sure that its previous definition doesn't mean much
to you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27df688"></a>Multiple key sequences</h2></div></div><p>Now, what about bindings involving multiple keys? For
example, I like to use the key sequence <b  >C-d C-d</b>
to delete a line (somewhat like its <b  >vi</b>
counterpart), and <b  >C-d g</b> to delete text from
point to the end of the buffer. The second argument to
<b  >global-set-key</b> can include multiple keys, but
the problem is that <b  >C-d</b> already has a meaning.
We want to use <b  >C-d</b> as a &ldquo;prefix&rdquo; key for the
commands <b  >C-d C-d</b> and <b  >C-d g</b>,
so first we have to unbind <b  >C-d</b>. Here's what we
do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
; Various keys for nuking text (global-unset-key "\C-d")
(global-set-key "\C-d g" 'my-nuke-to-end)
(global-set-key "\C-d\C-d" 'my-nuke-line)
</pre><p>We simply use <b  >global-unset-key</b> to unbind
<b  >C-d</b>, and then bind new meanings to <b  >C-d
g</b> and <b  >C-d C-d</b>. However, these
functions are bound to the mysterious functions
<b  >my-nuke-to-end</b>, and
<b  >my-nuke-line</b>, which the astute among you will
notice aren't standard Emacs functions. We have to define
them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27d65f8"></a>Defining a new function</h2></div></div><p>Defining an Emacs LISP function is rather simple. Of course,
Emacs functions can be quite powerful and complex, but in this case
we're going to use the function to call a short sequence of other
functions, which isn't so frightening. In general, if you need a
key binding to call several functions in sequence, you must define
a new function to wrap the sequence in.</p><p>Here is the definition of <b  >my-nuke-to-end</b>,
which should be placed above the corresponding call to
<b  >global-set-key</b>, which uses it, in the
<b  >.emacs</b> file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun my-nuke-to-end ()
  "Nuke text from here to end of buffer."
  (interactive "*")
  (kill-region (point) (point-max)))
</pre><p>The defun function takes as arguments the function name to
define, a list of arguments (which, here, is empty), followed by
the body of the function. Note that the first line of the body is a
string constant, which is a short description of the function. This
string is displayed when <b  >describe-key</b> or
<b  >describe-function</b> is used to display information
about <b  >my-nuke-to-end</b>.</p><p>The second line of the body is a call to the
<b  >interactive</b> function. This is required for
functions that are bound to keys. It simply tells Emacs how to
execute the function interactively (that is, when called from a key
sequence). The argument to interactive, &ldquo;*&rdquo;, indicates that the
function should not be executed within a read-only buffer. Check
out the documentation for <b  >interactive</b> if you
want the gritty details. (See the sidebar &ldquo;Getting the Emacs LISP
Manual&rdquo; for information on obtaining this documentation.)</p><p>The last line of the body uses the Emacs internal function
<b  >kill-region</b> to delete a region of text. The two
functions point and <b  >point-max</b> return the current
location of point, and the position of the end of the buffer,
respectively. <b  >kill-region</b> deletes the text
between these two locations.</p><p>The definition for <b  >my-nuke-line</b> is
somewhat more involved, because there is no single Emacs function
that this operation maps to. Here it is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun my-nuke-line (arg)
   "Nuke a line."
   (interactive "*p")
   (beginning-of-line nil)
   (kill-line arg)
   (if (= (point) (point-max))
       (progn
        (forward-line -1)
        (end-of-line nil)
        (kill-line arg)
        (beginning-of-line nil))))
</pre><p>First of all, we see that this function now takes an
argument, which we have called <b  >arg</b>. Many Emacs
key functions take a single numeric argument, which you can specify
by prefixing the key with <b  >C-u</b>, followed by a
number. (That is, unless you've rebound <b  >C-u</b>, as
we have.) This numeric argument changes the behavior of certain
functions. Here, <b  >arg</b> is passed along to
<b  >kill-line</b>, used on lines 4 and 9 of the function
body.</p><p><b  >my-nuke-line</b> is essentially a wrapper for
<b  >kill-line</b>, but takes care of a special case for
the last line in the buffer. In this case, we want to delete the
newline before the last line, which causes the last line to be
clipped out altogether (otherwise, Emacs deletes the line, but
leaves a blank one in its place). After
<b  >interactive</b> is called (with the &ldquo;*p&rdquo; argument,
which causes arg to be converted to a number),
<b  >beginning-of-line</b> moves point to (surprise!) the
beginning of the line. <b  >kill-line</b> is then
invoked. Note that <b  >kill-line</b> only kills text
from point to the end of the line; not the entire line.</p><p>Next, we compare the cursor position (point) with the
end-of-buffer position (<b  >point-max</b>). If they are
equal, then we are trying to delete the last line of the buffer,
and want to kill the previous terminating newline. We move back a
line (using <b  >forward-line</b> with an argument of
<b  >-1</b>), move to the end of that line, kill the rest
of the line (which consists only of the terminating newline), and
move back to the beginning of the line. All of this results in the
last line of the buffer being deleted.</p><p>I'm sure that there are Emacs gurus out there that can find
much better ways to accomplish the same thing; please bear with me.
I've been brainwashed by <b  >vi</b>. One of Emacs'
better features is that there are many ways to modify its
behavior.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27d7410"></a>Byte-compiling configuration code</h2></div></div><p>Now that you've had a crash course in Emacs LISP programming,
let's move on to something more practical. Once you start
customizing Emacs, you'll notice that your
<b  >.emacs</b> file gets to be quite large, and may take
a while to load. You may be aware that Emacs allows you to
byte-compile LISP source files for faster loading, so let's utilize
that feature on our <b  >.emacs</b> configuration
file.</p><p>The first step is to create a directory for your personal
Emacs LISP files to reside. At first this directory will contain
only one file; namely, your initial configuration file; but later
in life you may wish to write separate Elisp files. I use the
directory <b  >emacs</b> in my home directory for this
purpose.</p><p>Next, copy your <b  >.emacs</b> file to this
directory, and rename it to something like
<b  >startup.el</b>.</p><p>Now, we replace the contents of <b  >.emacs</b>
with a short bit of code that byte-compiles
<b  >emacs/startup.el</b> and loads it. However, we only
want to byte-compile <b  >startup.el</b> if it is newer
than its compiled counterpart, <b  >startup.elc</b>.
Here's the trick:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun byte-compile-if-newer-and-load (file)
   "Byte compile file.el if newer than file.elc"
    (if (file-newer-than-file-p (concat file ".el")
      (concat file ".elc"))
    (byte-compile-file (concat file ".el")))
    (load file))
(byte-compile-if-newer-and-load "~/emacs/startup")
</pre><p>This is blatantly obvious, I'm sure, but by way of
explanation: this bit of code defines a new function,
<b  >byte-compile-if-newer-and-load</b> (keeping in line
with the Emacs' affinity for verbose function names), and executes
it on <b  >~/emacs/startup.el</b>. We have now moved all
of the Emacs configuration code to <b  >startup.el</b>
which is byte-compiled when necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27d7af0"></a>Emacs and X</h2></div></div><p>Emacs and the X Window System are two good things that are
great together. In fact, my primary motivation for starting to use
Emacs for the four thousandth time was to have an editor that
incorporated many of the nice features of X, such as mouse-based
region cut-and-paste, and so forth. Emacs 19 has support for many
useful X-based features, some of which I'll introduce here.</p><p>The first thing that you might want to do when using Emacs
under X is customize the colors. I'm no fan of black and white; and
in fact, I prefer lighter fonts on a dark background. While you can
customize Emacs' X-specific attributes using the X resource
database (e.g., by editing <b  >~/.Xdefaults</b>), this
isn't quite flexible enough. Instead, we can use Emacs internal
functions such as <b  >set-foreground-color</b>.</p><p>For example, in your <b  >startup.el</b> file, you
might include:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(set-foreground-color "white")
(set-background-color "dimgray")
(set-cursor-color "red")
</pre><p>which will set these colors appropriately.</p><p>Emacs also provides support for faces, used most commonly
within <b  >font-lock-mode</b>. In this mode, text in the
current buffer is &ldquo;fontified&rdquo; so that, for example, C source
comments appear in one font face, and C function names in another.
Several of Emacs' major modes have support for font lock, including
C mode, Info, Emacs-Lisp mode, and so on. Each mode has different
rules for determining how text is fontified.</p><p>For simplicity, I employ faces of the same font, but which
use different colors. For example, I set the &ldquo;bold&rdquo; face to light
blue, and &ldquo;bold-italic&rdquo; to a sick shade of green. Each major mode
has a different use for each face; for instance, within Info, the
bold face is used to highlight node names, and within C mode, the
bold-italic face is used for function names.</p><p>The Emacs functions <b  >set-face-foreground</b>
and <b  >set-face-background</b> are used to set the
colors corresponding to each face. For a list of available faces
and their current display parameters, use the command <b  >M-x
list-faces-display</b>.</p><p>For example, I use the following commands in
<b  >startup.el</b> to configure faces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(set-face-foreground 'bold "lightblue")
(set-face-foreground 'bold-italic "olivedrab2")
(set-face-foreground 'italic "lightsteelblue")
(set-face-foreground 'modeline "white")
(set-face-background 'modeline "black")
(set-face-background 'highlight "blue")
(set-face-underline-p 'bold nil)
(set-face-underline-p 'underline nil)
</pre><p>The modeline face (which is referred to in the Emacs
documentation as mode-line, for some reason) is used for the mode
line and menu bar. Also, the function
<b  >set-face-underline-p</b> can be used to specify
whether a particular face should be underlined. In this case I turn
off underlining for the faces bold and underline. (A non-underlined
underline face? Hey, this is Emacs. Anything is possible.)</p><p>In order to use all of these wonderful faces, you'll need to
turn on <b  >font-lock-mode</b>. You may also wish to
enable <b  >transient-mark-mode</b>, which causes the
current region (text between point and mark) to be highlighted
using the region face. The following commands will enable
this.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(transient-mark-mode 1)
(font-lock-mode 1)
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x27d83e0"></a>Using hooks</h2></div></div><p>One problem with the above configuration is that
<b  >font-lock-mode</b> is not automatically enabled for
each major mode. Including the <b  >font-lock-mode</b>
command in your <b  >startup.el</b> file will enable this
mode when Emacs first begins, but not for each new buffer that you
create. In general, this is true for any Emacs minor mode; you must
turn on the minor modes whenever you enter a new major mode.</p><p>What we want to do is have the
<b  >font-lock-mode</b> command be executed whenever we
enter certain modes, such as C mode or Emacs LISP mode. Happily,
Emacs provides &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; which allow you to execute functions when
certain events occur.</p><p>Let's turn on several minor modes whenever we enter C mode,
Emacs LISP mode, or Text mode:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun my-enable-minor-modes ()
   "Enables several minor modes."
   (interactive "")
   (transient-mark-mode 1)
   (font-lock-mode 1))
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-enable-minor-modes)
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-enable-minor-modes)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'my-enable-minor-modes)
</pre><p>Now you should find that upon entering any of these major
modes, the corresponding minor modes are enabled as well. In
general, each major mode has an entry hook, named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>modename</em></span><b  >-hook</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x2aebad8"></a>Local key bindings</h2></div></div><p>Instead of using <b  >global-set-key</b> to define
key bindings for all major modes, we can use
<b  >define-key</b> to set bindings for particular modes.
In this way we can specify the behavior of certain keys based on
the major mode that you happen to be in.</p><p>For example, I prefer that the return key indent the next
line of text relative to the one above it (if the previous line is
indented five spaces, the next line should be as well). To enable
this feature in C mode, Emacs LISP mode, and Indented Text Mode,
use the commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(define-key indented-text-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)
(define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)
(define-key c-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)
</pre><p>Each mode has a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>modename</em></span><b  >-map</b> associated
with it, which specifies the key bindings for that mode. As you may
have guessed, <b  >newline-and-indent</b> is the Emacs
function which does a newline followed by a relative indent.</p><p>When editing files, Emacs usually determines the mode to use
from the filename extension. If I were to edit a new file called
<b  >clunker.c</b>, C mode would be used as the default.
However, when unable to make a decision, Emacs uses Fundamental
mode. I prefer to use Indented Text mode instead, which is enabled
with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(setq default-major-mode 'indented-text-mode)
</pre><p>Local key bindings can be used for more interesting tasks
than those demonstrated above. For example, the command
<b  >M-x compile</b> will issue the command make
<b  >-k</b> (by default) in the current directory,
thereby compiling whatever code you may have been working on.
Output and error messages from the make command are displayed in a
separate window. You can select error messages from the compilation
buffer, in which case Emacs will automatically open up the
corresponding source file and jump to the line containing the
error. In all, this makes editing, compiling, and debugging
programs much more efficient; you can do literally everything
within Emacs.</p><p>In order to automate the process of saving the current source
file and issuing make, we can bind the key sequence <b  >C-c
C-c</b> to a new function; let's call it
<b  >my-save-and-compile</b>. The code looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(defun my-save-and-compile ()
   "Save current buffer and issue compile."
   (interactive "")
   (save-buffer 0)
   (compile "make -k"))
(define-key c-mode-map "\C-c\C-c" 'my-save-and-compile)
</pre><p>The <b  >save-buffer</b> command is used to save
the current source file, and compile is issued with the command
make <b  >-k</b>. Now, with two simple keystokes you can
fire your source file off to the compiler, and wait for the error
messages to roll in. Without the
<b  >my-save-and-compile</b> function, you have to save
the source file (using <b  >C-x C-s</b>) and issue
<b  >M-x compile</b> by hand.</p><p>Of course, to use this feature you'll have to create a
Makefile in the directory where your source files live. (The
<b  >make</b> command is issued in the directory
containing the source file in question.) Creating Makefiles is
another issue altogether. A future issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> will
discuss this subject, but in the meantime there are several sources
of information about make. The book Managing Projects with make
from O'Reilly and Associates is a good place to start, as is the
GNU make Manual, which covers the version of make available on
Linux systems.</p><p>Also note that compile will first prompt you to save any
modified buffers. If you modify only one buffer at a time,
<b  >my-save-and-compile</b> saves it for you. We could
have <b  >my-save-and-compile</b> save all modified
buffers, but you may not want that to happen automatically behind
your back.</p><p>As we mentioned, the <b  >compile</b> function will
open a new window containing messages from the make command. From
this buffer, you can select error messages for Emacs to
automatically jump to, allowing you to fix the problem and move on.
If you are running Emacs under X, clicking on an error message with
the second mouse button will take you to the line containing the
error. Otherwise, you can move point to the error message (in the
compilation buffer), and use <b  >C-c C-c</b> (don't be
confused by the multiple meanings of this key sequence).
Alternately, you can use the function <b  >next-error</b>
to visit the next error message. In my
<b  >startup.el</b> I have this function bound to
<b  >M-n</b> in C mode (which, by now, you should know
how to do).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e6580.0x2aec840"></a>Miscellaneous Customizations</h2></div></div><p>There are several small items that you might want to
