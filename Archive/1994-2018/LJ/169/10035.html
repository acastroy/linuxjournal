An introduction to OpenID, an open-source, distributed, single
sign-on solution for Internet applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1349580.0x1441358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Thank goodness for Firefox. Yes, it's a great browser. Yes, it
has all sorts of wonderful plugins that let me do everything from
debugging my Web applications to checking the weather forecast. And, the fact
that it works across multiple platforms makes it even better.
</p><p>
But, as Web-based applications become an increasingly integral part of
my life, I've grown dependent on Firefox's ability to remember my
passwords. It might be silly, or even a bit pathetic, but there is
no way I can remember all the different passwords 
I've created over the years. This is especially true for sites 
where I've changed my password on occasion, either because my
current password expired or because I decided to change it.
</p><p>
This also means that when I use a different browser, or even a
different computer, I'm often at a total loss. Sure, I remember some
of my passwords, but there is no easy way for me to keep track of all
of them without writing them down somewhere. So, I do the digital
equivalent&mdash;storing them in my browser&mdash;and make sure I
have my laptop with me wherever I go.
</p><p>
Juggling multiple passwords isn't new, of course. Even before the
growth of Web applications, people were logging in to different computers,
networks, e-mail accounts, database systems and so on. A
number of companies made quite a bit of money from &ldquo;single
sign-on&rdquo;,
offering back-end solutions that allowed people to log in to a
single computer, providing them with access to many different ones.
</p><p>
But, although the problem might not be new, its scale is unprecedented.
We no longer are worried about several hundreds or thousands of individuals
keeping track of a dozen passwords, with access to an IT support
department. Rather, we now have to worry about many millions of
people, each of whom has dozens of passwords and little or no
technical support for any of them.
</p><p>
Moreover, each Web site has its own particular needs, not to mention
its own unique user interface. And, to top it off, the world is quite
different from a corporation; you can't impose a standard
solution from above. Rather, there must be a way to introduce
competition into the equation, such that individuals can choose their
own single sign-on provider.
</p><p>
Over the years, a number of companies have tried to enter this space
for Internet applications. Perhaps the most famous (or infamous) was
Microsoft's .NET Passport (now known as Windows Live ID), which was
launched with great fanfare&mdash;and quickly attracted a great deal of
negative attention related to privacy concerns. Even if
Microsoft's product was technically excellent (and I'm not
knowledgeable enough to judge it), people did not want to be told with
whom they must entrust private and sensitive data.
</p><p>
An increasingly popular solution to this problem is OpenID. OpenID is
not necessarily a new technology; it has existed in some form or
another for several years already. However, it rapidly is picking up
steam&mdash;so much that right before I wrote these words in February 2008, we
saw Microsoft, Google, IBM, VeriSign and Yahoo embrace OpenID.
</p><p>
Now, it's true that the number of sites supporting OpenID is
currently small&mdash;numbering about 8,000 at the time of this writing. However, the
number is growing rapidly, and I expect the pace will pick up
as the aforementioned Internet giants begin to get involved.
</p><p>
What if you're smaller than Google or Microsoft? Is OpenID
worth adding to your site? Is it relatively easy? The answer to
both questions, I'm happy to say, is yes.
</p><p>
This month, I discuss the user side of OpenID&mdash;how you
register for an OpenID and how you manage it. I also explain
how the OpenID specification takes into account the fact that you
might eventually need to change providers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1349580.0x1441930"></a>
The Basics of OpenID</h2></div></div><p>
The term OpenID refers both to a person's unique identifier and to
the standard describing all the technology around that identifier.
To create an OpenID, you must register with an OpenID provider. Once
you have registered your OpenID, it is the provider that authenticates
you for every OpenID-enabled application you use. In other
words, the OpenID provider is responsible for checking your identity,
which normally means confirming that the user name and password you
enter are acceptable.
</p><p>
Thus, logging in to a site with OpenID means the following happens:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You tell the Web application you want to log in with the OpenID
protocol.
</p></li><li><p>
You enter your OpenID (more detail on this shortly)
into the application's login screen.
</p></li><li><p>
The application sends you to the login screen for your OpenID
provider.
</p></li><li><p>
If the provider accepts your credentials (normally, your user name and
password), it asks you to confirm that your identity may be exported
to the Web application, and if it may do so in the future as well.
Obviously, if you indicate you are willing to share your
identity with this Web application in the future, you will skip this
step in the future.
</p></li><li><p>
Once allowed to export your identity to the Web application, you are
returned to the original application you wanted to use, logged in
and ready to use it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Notice there are a few important differences here between OpenID
and a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; login system. First, users authenticate
against a different site from the one they are trying to use. This is
similar to making a purchase via Google Checkout or PayPal, both of
which require that users authenticate themselves and authorize the
purchase amount on their own sites, rather than on the site belonging
to the on-line store.
</p><p>
Some critics of OpenID say that users may be surprised or confused by
the switch from one site to another, but I think Google Checkout
and PayPal have demonstrated that a reasonable number of people are
not put off by switching back and forth. Moreover, I have read that
Firefox 3 will include some integrated OpenID support, which might
remove some of the need to switch sites&mdash;or at least make it appear
more integrated. However, I've been using the beta of Firefox 3 for
several months and have yet to experience such integration.
</p><p>
And, although I use the term Web application, there is no requirement
that OpenID be used only for Web-based applications. I expect that as
OpenID takes hold, a large number of Internet-based applications,
obviously including those that run on the Web, will use OpenID. However,
there's no reason why non-Web applications and services couldn't use
OpenID as well. I even can imagine a day when you might use OpenID to
enter your house or confirm your identity to your burglar-alarm
company. In the world of OpenID, end-user applications are known as
consumers, just as the OpenID authentication systems are known as
providers.
</p><p>
Most OpenID providers authenticate users with a user name and password.
Over time, we can expect them to go in other directions as well&mdash;for
example, using biometric authentication systems. And, although OpenID
providers currently offer their services for free, it's not hard to
imagine a time in which some companies will charge for OpenID
services, while others will support themselves via advertising. Because
users
can switch OpenID providers at any time, and because
users have a choice as to which one they will use, we
can expect both competition and ingenuity to be the rule.
</p><p>
One company, Vidoop, has a particularly interesting authentication
mechanism, in which users select a pattern of images as their
&ldquo;password&rdquo;. Each time a user wants to authenticate, a set of
images&mdash;including those that the user has selected&mdash;appears on a 3x3
grid, with each image in a randomly selected location and a random
letter placed next to it. This effectively creates a one-time
password, which users enter by typing the letters associated with
the ordered set of images they originally chose.
</p><p>
Finally, I should note that you can create and use as many OpenIDs as
you like, just as you would normally create as many user names as you like
on a Web site. Some people do this to separate their work ID
from their personal ID, or just because they prefer not to put all of
their eggs in one authentication basket. Regardless, OpenID allows
you to do this&mdash;although it is ironic that a single sign-on solution
would spur people to create multiple identities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1349580.0x1442170"></a>
Creating and Using an OpenID</h2></div></div><p>
With all the background information out of the way, let's create and use an
OpenID. An OpenID is nothing more than a URL, typically written as
http://USERNAME.PROVIDER.com.
For example, my OpenID is http://reuvenmlerner.myopenid.com.
</p><p>
Notice that I can share this URL publicly; there is no reason for me to
keep it secret. MyOpenID.com is just one of several OpenID providers.
Indeed, many people already have an OpenID, even if they don't realize
it. For example, if you have a blog at LiveJournal, that URL can be
used as your OpenID.
</p><p>
To sign up for an OpenID, simply go to the home page of your provider.
For example, go to the MyOpenID.com home page and click on
&ldquo;sign up for an OpenID&rdquo;. That takes you to
<a href="https://www.myopenid.com/signup" target="_self">https://www.myopenid.com/signup</a>, which asks you to enter a user name
(it must be unique) and a password. You also can provide an e-mail
address, which is optional, but doing so allows you to recover your password
if you
ever forget it. Finally, MyOpenID.com uses a captcha to ensure that a
person, rather than a program, is signing up for the account.
</p><p>
Once you have signed up for an OpenID, you can use it to log in to a
Web site that supports it. Typically, logging in to a Web site
requires that you enter both a user name and password. But, if you
use OpenID, you enter in neither of these to the Web application's
login screen. Instead, you enter only the URL of your OpenID,
including the http prefix that we so often ignore nowadays.
</p><p>
For example, I can go to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com" target="_self">www.wikihow.com</a>, a site that lets
anyone create a how-to manual. I click on &ldquo;create an account or log
in&rdquo; at the top of the page, which brings me to a login screen. The
resulting screen tells me I can log in using OpenID, if I want,
by going to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Special:OpenIDLogin" target="_self">www.wikihow.com/Special:OpenIDLogin</a>. (In other
words, wikiHow has two separate login pages: one for
regular users with a user name/password combination and another for
OpenID users, who enter only their OpenID URL.) Finally,
I enter http://reuvenmlerner.myopenid.com into the text field.
</p><p>
Because I had logged in to OpenID earlier, I wasn't asked to
provide my password. However, this is the first time I've
tried to log in to wikiHow with OpenID. Thus, MyOpenID.com must 
verify that I am willing to share information with wikiHow. I
click on the allow forever button, which means whenever I'm
logged in to MyOpenID.com, it should share information with
wikiHow. After clicking this button, I am redirected back to
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com" target="_self">www.wikihow.com</a>, where I am logged in and identified by my first name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1349580.0x1442640"></a>
Switching Providers</h2></div></div><p>
This system works quite well in my experience, and you quickly become
used to the back and forth authentication process. However, 
major problems remain. What happens if MyOpenID.com goes out of
business? What if its database is compromised? What if it turns
out to be highly unethical and is using people's IDs? What if I
find a provider whose Web site is more attractive to me?
</p><p>
I always can switch to a different provider, of course. But, that
effectively means having a new and different user name on a site.
On a social-networking site, this obviously would be disastrous, as
I would need to reconnect from my new account to each of the people in
my old account.
</p><p>
The solution to this is quite clever. Instead of giving people the
OpenID I mentioned above, I instead give them an OpenID on a Web
site that I control, whose URL is unlikely ever to change. For
example, I can give an OpenID of http://reuven.lerner.co.il.
</p><p>
I know that the lerner.co.il domain will remain mine forever. Thus, I can
be reasonably sure that this URL also will be in my possession
for a long time. Moreover, I control the contents of the home
page. That page may contain any HTML content I want. But, it
also should contain the following two &lt;link&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt;
section:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;link rel="openid.server" href="http://www.myopenid.com/server" /&gt;
&lt;link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://reuvenmlerner.myopenid.com/" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
We already saw how I can log in to wikiHow by giving my OpenID at
MyOpenID.com. But, with the above lines in place, I also can log in to
wikiHow by entering http://reuven.lerner.co.il.
</p><p>
This tells wikiHow to retrieve the home page from my personal Web
site. It uses the first &lt;link&gt; tag to know which server to use and
the second &lt;link&gt; tag to know which user name and ID to authenticate.
Everything then continues as usual. I authenticate myself as
necessary against MyOpenID.com, which then redirects me back to
wikiHow.
</p><p>
The beauty of this redirection system is that if I decide against
using MyOpenID for any reason in the future, I simply change the
&lt;link&gt; tags in index.html. wikiHow and all other sites will
follow whatever reuven.lerner.co.il points to, whether it's
MyOpenID.com, Vidoop.com or something else. In this way, I ensure
that my OpenID always is associated with the provider who offers me
the best combination of security and usability for my purposes.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, things don't always go smoothly. For example, when I
registered with wikiHow, it got my nickname (Reuven) from
MyOpenID.com. When I try to log in with my new, redirected OpenID,
wikiHow thinks it's dealing with a new user&mdash;one whose
requested nickname clashes with that of an existing user. So, the key is
to set up and use the redirecting URL early on, and not
switch to it after you already have used OpenID for some time.
</p><p>
There are other problems as well. For example, I
currently juggle two different sets of identities on-line, as some
companies want to deal only with US citizens living in the United
States. And, although I'm currently back home in Modi'in, Israel, I
continue to have a US phone number (through Skype), a mailing address
(at my parents' house), and a US bank account and credit card. So,
I need two separate identities: one with my Israeli information
and another with my US information.
</p><p>
Fortunately, OpenID 2.0 supports both the export of information to the
consumer application and also the use of multiple personas. Each
persona can have a separate name, nickname, image and location, and I
can choose which persona is associated with each consumer, under the
umbrella of the same OpenID.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OpenID is an increasingly important standard that seems poised to have
a central role in future Web and Internet-connected applications.
Using OpenID is not terribly complicated for end users, and it 
supposedly is going to be integrated into Firefox in the near future.
</p><p>
Next month, we will look at OpenID from the perspective of a Web site
that requires users to register. How can you, as a Web developer,
support OpenID on your site? We will see that with a bit of work,
and some support from open-source libraries, we can support OpenID in
our Web applications.
