Make your desktop completely portable with a custom live CD.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe9b580.0xf93460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my recent column &ldquo;Security Features in Ubuntu&rdquo;
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, March 2008), I mentioned
that the live CD method of running Linux from a CD-ROM or DVD rather than
directly from a hard drive has important and useful security ramifications.
I went on to promise that this would be the topic of a future column.
</p><p>
Never one to renege on a promise, this month I bring you the first of a
multipart series about Linux live CDs. In this month's column, I describe
some security usages for bootable Linux CDs and demonstrate a quick-and-easy way to customize the standard Ubuntu Desktop CD that allows you to
change its included bundle of software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe9b580.0xf93720"></a>
Uses of Bootable Linux CDs</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you may be wondering, &ldquo;What's the big deal about bootable
Linux CDs? Aren't all Linux installation CDs bootable?&rdquo;
</p><p>
On the one hand, yes. Linux installation CDs always have been bootable.
But,
not all Linux installation CDs offer you the option of simply running Linux
from the CD <span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> installing it right away. This is the difference
between a live Linux CD and an installer CD.
</p><p>
Live CDs are especially handy for trying out a distribution before
committing it to your hard disk. Usually, they include an installer applet
that makes it easy to make that commitment, if you so choose. But, these are
very general live CD uses.
</p><p>
For the security-conscious user, or for the conscientious-security user
(but not for the unconscious user), live CDs also are useful, among other
things, for the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Using untrusted hardware, such as public-use PCs at coffee shops.
</p></li><li><p>
Analyzing computers that may have been compromised.
</p></li><li><p>
Recovering data from systems that no longer boot for some reason.
</p></li><li><p>
Running software you'd prefer not to install on your hard disk.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Depending on your needs, you might be perfectly happy using an existing
Linux live CD distribution, such as Knoppix, BackTrack or Ubuntu Desktop.
But, what if you want to apply the very latest security patches to the
live CD's installed applications? What if your favorite live CD lacks an
application you really need? Or, what if you don't want to have to 
configure things manually, such as network settings, after every single
time you boot?
</p><p>
These are some of the many reasons you might want to customize your Linux
live CD. For the remainder of this month's column, I walk through the
process of patching and adding security software to Ubuntu Desktop 7.10.
Much of what follows applies directly to other squashfs-based
distributions, such as Linux Mint, SLAX and BackTrack, and indirectly to
most other live CD distributions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe9b580.0xf93e00"></a>
Prerequisites</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can customize your Ubuntu Desktop live CD, you need several
things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
An ISO file for the current version of Ubuntu Desktop (or Linux Mint).
</p></li><li><p>
The squashfs-tools package installed on your system.
</p></li><li><p>
The mkisofs package installed on your system.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You can get the ISO file in one of two ways: download it from
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_self">www.ubuntu.com</a>, or create it from an actual Ubuntu CD via the dd
command, like this:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ dd if=/dev/cdrom of=./ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso
</pre>
</p><p>
For the remainder of this article, I assume your ISO image resides in
your home directory. I also assume you're running Ubuntu, but if you
aren't, for commands that begin with <tt  >sudo</tt>, you instead should do whatever
else you usually do to become root temporarily (for example,
<tt  >su</tt> or <tt  >su
-c</tt>).
</p><p>
The squashfs-tools package provides utilities for creating and mounting
squashfs filesystems. Most of an Ubuntu live CD is taken up by one enormous
squashfs image that is uncompressed and mounted as / when you boot the
CD. To remaster the CD, you need to mount a copy of its squashfs image,
change various files and directories in it, and save the edited directory
structure as a new squashfs image.
</p><p>
Finally, you'll use the mkisofs command to convert the various files and
directories you've just edited into a single ISO image file.
</p><p>
In describing how these three prerequisites relate to each other, I also
discuss the three stages of the live CD remastering process: mounting the
squashfs image, changing it in various ways and incorporating it into a
new ISO image. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe9b580.0xf944e0"></a>
The Procedure</h2></div></div><p>
The procedure I'm about to step through is based on the one at
<a href="http://www.debuntu.org" target="_self">www.debuntu.org</a> (see Resources). Much of what follows won't be very
security-focused; in subsequent columns, I'll go into greater depth in
applying this stuff to security applications. Right now, my immediate goal
is to tell you what you need to know to begin experimenting with your own
customized live CDs right away, and I'm sure you'll think of cool things to do
between now and my next column.
</p><p>
In demonstrating these commands, I'm going to try a new convention that
bends reality a little bit and will number each bash-prompt: 01-$,
02-$, and so on. This way, I'll be able to refer to each command by
line number. We'll see whether this helps, or whether I'm just getting
nostalgic for my BASIC programming days&mdash;send me an e-mail if you have an opinion
either way.
</p><p>
First, log on as a nonprivileged user, open a
command window (none of what we do here will require the X Window System),
and navigate to your home directory. Type this command to create mountpoints for the old ISO image and its squashfs image, a top-level directory
for creating the new CD file hierarchy and a directory for rebuilding the
root filesystem that will become the new squashfs image:

<pre     class="programlisting">
01-$ mkdir -p ./isomount ./isonew/squashfs ./isonew/cd ./isonew/custom
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, mount the original ISO image, and copy everything in it, except the
squashfs image itself, into the ./isonew/cd directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
02-$ sudo mount -o loop ./ubuntu-7.10-desktop-i386.iso ./isomount/

03-$ rsync --exclude=/casper/filesystem.squashfs -a ./isomount/
&#8618;./isonew/cd
</pre>
</p><p>
Line 03 uses rsync rather than cp, so you don't need to
repopulate the isonew/cd directory every time you make a new ISO image.
Whenever rsync encounters identical files, it copies only the differences
in the new file to the old one, rather than copying the entire file (if
there are no differences, it leaves the &ldquo;target&rdquo; version alone).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> if you're working within some
directory other than your home
directory, and if that directory is on a Windows partition rather than a
native Linux partition (such as ext2, ext3 or ReiserFS), you'll get
<span   class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> errors when copying files around&mdash;some of which may cause this
procedure to fail. You don't need to do all of this within your home
directory, but you should do it on a Linux partition.
</p><p>
You've copied the skeleton of the original CD into isonew/cd, so now you
can get busy with the squashed root filesystem by enabling squashfs
support in your running kernel and mounting the squashfs image:

<pre     class="programlisting">
04-$ sudo modprobe squashfs

05-$ sudo mount -t squashfs -o loop
&#8618;./isomount/casper/filesystem.squashfs ./isonew/squashfs/
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, copy the original root filesystem into the rebuild directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
06-$ sudo rsync -a ./isonew/squashfs/ ./isonew/custom
</pre>
</p><p>
Before you enter the Matrix by chrooting into this root filesystem and
customizing it, you should make sure networking and the apt system will work
once you do, by copying some configuration files from your running system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
07-$ sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /etc/hosts ./isonew/custom/etc/

08-$ sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list ./isonew/custom/etc/apt/
</pre>
</p><p>
This assumes, of course, that your running system <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> 
communicating with the network properly and that its sources.list file includes
entries for the universe, multiverse and partner repositories (or anywhere
else from whence you intend to obtain packages). If you have anything else
you'd like to include in your custom live CD, such as other configuration
files, documents, images and so on, now is a good time to copy those over
too. Just remember that space is precious.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to enter your new root filesystem. I've written
extensively about using chroot jails to contain server d&aelig;mons, so that
if they're hijacked, the attacker gains access to only a small subset of
your filesystem. Well, right now, you're about to chroot
<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourself</em></span>, so
that all changes you make&mdash;adding and removing packages, downloading
updates, editing configuration files and so on&mdash;are applied to your custom
ISO's root filesystem, not your underlying system's root filesystem. 
</p><p>
Here's how to swallow the Blue Pill:

<pre     class="programlisting">
09-$ sudo chroot ./isonew/custom
</pre>
</p><p>
From this point on, until you type the command <tt  >exit</tt> (step 22,
below), you'll be in an environment in which / is no longer your
underlying filesystem's root, but actually /home/you/isonew/custom (where
/home/you is your local home directory, or wherever else you created the
isonew hierarchy).
</p><p>
Now that you're jacked in, you need to bring the proc and sysfs filesystems
on-line, so that your &ldquo;real&rdquo; system's kernel can interact properly with the
&ldquo;fake&rdquo; system represented by your soon-to-be-customized root filesystem.
Now, set your home directory to /root (actually
/home/you/isonew/custom/root):

<pre     class="programlisting">
10-# mount -t proc none /proc/

11-# mount -t sysfs none /sys/

12-# export HOME=/root
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the prompts in my examples have switched to # from $,
indicating that you're now running in a root shell. This is necessary,
because you'll need to be root in order to exit the chroot jail you've
voluntarily entered.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to customize. This is the part when you don't
necessarily need my help; you can be creative. For example purposes
though, let's make some space for new packages and update the ones that
are left.
</p><p>
What are you going to use your new live CD for? Secure Web browsing using
untrusted hardware isn't a bad start. You shouldn't need OpenOffice.org for
that, and it takes up something like 85MB of your compressed squashfs
image (remember, a standard CD ISO can't be larger than 650MB).
</p><p>
You can remove OpenOffice.org, plus a couple of things upon which only
OpenOffice.org depends, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
13-# apt-get remove --purge `dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package}\n'
&#8618;|grep openoffice`
</pre>
</p><p>
Did you notice the embedded <tt  >dpkg-query...|grep...</tt> command? It queries the
root filesystem's deb-package database for a complete list of installed
packages. The output of this is piped through a grep search for the string
&ldquo;openoffice&rdquo;. You can use the command in line 13 to find and purge other
groups of packages by simply changing the grep query.
</p><p>
Suppose you also want to get rid of The GIMP, which takes up more than 6.5MB
(after compression) on your live CD image. So, swap out the string
&ldquo;openoffice&rdquo; in the previous command with &ldquo;gimp&rdquo;, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
14-# apt-get remove --purge `dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package}\n'
&#8618;|grep gimp`
</pre>
</p><p>
Other good candidates for removal include non-English language packs (which
take up anywhere from 0.5&ndash;1.5MB compressed), and multimedia
applications such as Rhythmbox, totem and sound-juicer, which take up a
few megabytes each, even after compression, and are unlikely to be useful for
security purposes. 
</p><p>
Decide for yourself. Browse through the list of installed packages with a
quick <tt  >aptitude search ~i |less</tt>. If you mistakenly purge something you
decide you actually need, you always can exit the chroot jail and
re-execute the rsync command on line 06.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe9b580.0x138d7b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
aptitude vs. apt-get</b></p><p>
Note that I'm using apt-get here, rather than the more-sophisticated
aptitude. This is because one of aptitude's key features, the ability to
delete packages that are no longer necessary automatically, can be
dangerous when used on any system on which packages have been installed by
any tool other than aptitude.
</p><p>
Because aptitude maintains its <span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> database of installation histories,
it can miss key dependencies in this context and remove packages that you
do, in fact, need. Therefore, you should use aptitude only to remove programs
that you <span   class="emphasis"><em>installed</em></span> with aptitude. If you later need to undo an
installation that included automatically installed dependencies, you can
use <tt  >apt-get autoremove &lt;packagename&gt;</tt> to achieve the same thing.
</p></div><p>
So, now you've made room for your custom toolkit. If you want to use your
live CD for anonymous Web surfing, you may want to install Tor and Privoxy.
First, you need to update your custom root filesystem's package database
to synchronize it with the sources.list file you copied over in line 08:

<pre     class="programlisting">
15-# apt-get update
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can use <tt  >apt-get install</tt> just as you would on any other live
system to install your custom packages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
16-# apt-get install tor privoxy
</pre>
</p><p>
As a professional paranoiac, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that both
of these packages are from Ubuntu's universe repository, and as such,
they aren't provided with the same level of support as packages in the main and
restricted repositories, although the Ubuntu MOTO Security Team does its best to keep up
with security patches. This is a trade-off you'll probably find yourself
making frequently, however. As I pointed out in my column in the March 2008
issue, many
of Ubuntu's most useful security utilities are available only in the universe
and metaverse repositories.
</p><p>
After you've installed your custom applications, make sure
your entire system is fully patched. As with any other Ubuntu (or other
Debian-based) system, you can use <tt  >apt-get
dist-upgrade</tt>. Because this will
result in quite a bit of updates being downloaded and installed, and
because
space is at a premium on our ISO image, immediately follow the
upgrade with a <tt  >clean</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
17-# apt-get dist-upgrade

18-# apt-get clean
</pre>
</p><p>
Come to think of it, this one step&mdash;upgrading the live CD's
packages&mdash;may be the only security-related reason you need to customize your live CD.
Applying security patches is that important! 
</p><p>
There's just one more thing to do before packing up your new ISO: custom
configuration. You may want to edit the hosts or resolv.conf files you
copied over before (or, after exiting the chroot jail, you simply may want to
copy over them with the originals from ./isonew/squashfs/etc). You
may want to preconfigure Tor by editing /etc/tor/torrc and
/etc/tor/tor-socks.conf, and Privoxy via the files in /etc/privoxy.
</p><p>
As with removing and installing packages, this process is the same as on
any other system: fire up your (non-GUI) text editor of choice (nano, vi
and ed are all present in the standard Ubuntu ISO), and edit anything that
needs editing.
</p><p>
Are you done customizing? If so, you can take your Red Pill and exit the
Matrix&mdash;I mean, the chroot jail. On your way out, empty the /tmp directory,
and unmount the chrooted /proc and /sys filesystems:


<pre     class="programlisting">
19-# rm -rf /tmp/*

20-# umount /proc/

21-# umount /sys/

22-# exit
</pre>
</p><p>
You're back in reality (at least, back in your previous working directory on
the underlying system). Before you pack up your ISO, you'll have to build a
new manifest file (a list of all packages in the new live CD root
filesystem), recompress the customized root filesystem into a squashfs
file and regenerate the md5sum of your live CD files.
</p><p>
First, to rebuild your manifest file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
23-$ chmod +w ./isonew/cd/casper/filesystem.manifest

24-$ sudo chroot ./isonew/custom dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package}
&#8618;${Version}\n' &gt; ./isonew/cd/casper/filesystem.manifest

25-$ sudo cp ./isonew/cd/casper/filesystem.manifest
&#8618;./isonew/cd/casper/filesystem.manifest-desktop
</pre>
</p><p>
In line 23, you made the old manifest file writeable, so you could copy over
it. In line 24, you temporarily popped back into the root filesystem chroot
jail to generate the package list with dpkg-query. And in line 25, you
copied the new manifest into an identical file called
filesystem.manifest-desktop.
</p><p>
Now you can resquash your root filesystem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
26-$ sudo mksquashfs ./isonew/custom
&#8618;./isonew/cd/casper/filesystem.squashfs
</pre>
</p><p>
If you like, you can edit the DISKNAME parameter in the file
./isonew/README.diskdefines. Regardless, next you should regenerate your
live CD's md5sum, so you can detect tampering later on:

<pre     class="programlisting">
27-$ sudo rm ./isonew/cd/md5sum.txt

28-$ sudo -s

29-# cd ./isonew/cd

30-# find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum &gt; md5sum.txt

31-# exit
</pre>
</p><p>
And, you've reached the final step. Now you can write your finished ISO
image file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
32-$ cd ./isonew/cd

33-$ sudo mkisofs -r -V "Ubuntu-Live-PrivateSurf" -b
&#8618;isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -cache-inodes -J -l
&#8618;-no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o
&#8618;~/Ubuntu-Live-7.10-PrivateSurf.iso .
</pre>
</p><p>
Your home directory now contains a new customized live CD ISO file, named
Ubuntu-Live-7.10-PrivateSurf.iso. You can boot it directly from hard disk
using VMware, QEMU or some other virtualization engine to test it. Or, of
course, simply burn it to CD using your CD-writing utility of choice.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
You've now got the basic technique for customizing an Ubuntu live CD.
Although I didn't go into much depth showing actual customizations
beyond removing and adding packages, I'll continue this series next time
with detailed guidance on bundling and preconfiguring specific security
tools into your live CD. 
</p><p>
Until then, have fun experimenting with live CDs, and of course, be safe!
