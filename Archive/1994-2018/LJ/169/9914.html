Augmenting IP with movement awareness.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e17580.0x1f0f348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Free software is freedom, and so is mobility. In an age of embedded
devices, nomadic users and omnipresent wireless connectivity, augmenting
the venerable Internet Protocol (IP) with movement awareness and
adaptability is due. IP's founding architects 
designed it with the assumption that the Internet node is static. This
simplified the design by enabling a single field, the IP address,
to signify both location and identity. A sending machine refers to a
receiving one by the IP address (the identification role), and routers
in the network use the IP address to direct traffic to the right path
(the topological role). In this age of portability and nomadicity,
this conflation of functions introduces a contradiction. For routing
to do its job, the address needs to change according to the location;
for the address to be used as an identifier, it must remain fixed.
</p><p>
Mobile IP (MIP), an extension of IP, provides a solution for that
problem. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been actively
developing MIP for both IPv4 and IPv6 since the 1990s. The Mobile IPv6
(MIPv6) standard advanced from draft status to Proposed Standard (PS)
status in 2004. Since then, optimizing and securing MIPv6 has become an
active standardization and development area. A cost-effective, flexible
and insightful vehicle for getting hands-on experience with MIPv6 is
to experiment with the Mobile IPv6 for Linux (MIPL) package that the
Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) has been developing since 1999.
</p><p>
The purpose of this article is to get you, the brave roamer, primed
in MIPv6 by experimenting with MIPL. It assumes basic understanding of
IPv6 and wireless LAN networking, and it consists of two parts: the first
introduces MIPv6, and the second introduces MIPL. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e17580.0x1f0f608"></a>
MIPv6</h2></div></div><p>
IP mobility means the ability to handle
movement gracefully. Movement, in the context of MIP, is an event or an operation
that causes a machine to change its IP address. It is a movement from
one IP subnet to another. Physical movement could cause it, but that isn't
the only way a machine could &ldquo;move&rdquo; in the context of MIP. At the same
time, physical movement doesn't necessarily translate to a network
layer movement. Movement within a single wireless cell, for example,
doesn't cause a subnet change and, thus, isn't movement from MIP's
perspective. Movement is problematic for traditional IP. It forces a
machine to change its IP address so as to belong to the new subnet to which it
has just moved. Movement changes the machine's identification. It tears down TCP connections, such as Web-browsing sessions, because the IP address is one of the parameters that identifies a TCP connection. This
makes for a rough roaming experience, as sessions have to be re-established
each time a handover happens.
</p><p>
MIP deals with movement by decoupling identity
from location. MIP provides
each Mobile Node (MN) with two addresses: a permanent (long-term)
address that embodies identity, called the Home Address (HoA),
and a temporary (short-term) address that embodies location, called the
Care-of Address (CoA). The HoA remains fixed, while the CoA freely
changes according to the location of the node. MIP provides a mechanism
to map between the two addresses dynamically. A moving machine (Mobile
Node) changes its CoA each time it moves from one subnet to another, but
it maintains its HoA and uses it to provide any node communicating with it,
called a Correspondent Node (CN), with a stable destination address.
</p><p>
The mapping between the HoA and the CoA is called binding
and is the central concept underlying MIP. The message that establishes
the binding is called a Binding Update (BU). A table that tracks
bindings is called a Binding Cache (BC). Sending Binding Updates
and maintaining Binding Caches is the essence of MIP. All other aspects
of the MIP protocol are to scale, secure, optimize and generally enhance
the way bindings are established and used.
</p><p>
To provide a concrete description of MIP, let's look at the interactions
between the participants in MIP in its most basic mode of operation
(without Route Optimization). At its home network (home link), the MN
uses its address (the HoA) in the standard fashion. MIPv6 kicks in upon
movement detection. When the MN notices that its current default router
has disappeared (it can no longer hear the router's advertisements)
and that a new router is now chirping, it concludes that it has
&ldquo;moved&rdquo; and uses the new prefix (subnet ID) to configure
a new address (a new CoA) that belongs to the new subnet. It then sends
a BU to a special router on the home link, called the Home Agent (HA),
telling it that the HoA it &ldquo;owns&rdquo; is now bound to that
new CoA. The HA records the mapping between the HoA and the CoA in its
BC. Adding an entry to the BC is called registration. Traffic destined
to the HoA, from any CN on the Internet, is routed to the home network
because the HoA topologically belongs to it. There, the HA intercepts
it and tunnels it to the MN's CoA address registered in the BC. Return
traffic is reverse tunneled from the MN back to the HA and then sent from
the HA to the CN. This way, the MN becomes always addressable by its HoA.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e17580.0x1f0f978"></a>
MIPL </h2></div></div><p>
MIPL consists of two components: a kernel-space component, in the form
of a kernel patch, and a user-space component, in the form of a Mobility
D&aelig;mon (mip6d). The d&aelig;mon implements most of the functionality. It
discovers location, detects movement, sends and processes BUs and
maintains the BC. The MIPL patch provides the kernel support required for
the d&aelig;mon to perform those functions. The MIPL patch adds, for example,
support for the Mobility Header protocol (MH), which is the IPv6 extension
header that transports BUs and Binding Acknowledgments (BAs) and other
binding-related messages. In addition to the MIPL package, we'll need to
install the Router Advertisement D&aelig;mon (radvd), as MIPv6 relies on the
auto-configuration provided by router advertisements to detect movement
and configure CoA addresses among other mobility-related tasks.
</p><p>
To explore the basic operation of MIPv6, let's use MIPL to create
a simple MIP network consisting of two MIPL-patched Linux machines:
a router, called denali, and a laptop, called raven. The laptop is a
typical x86 machine that has a single 802.11b wireless interface and
will be our MN. The router is a fanless, headless, single-board computer
(Soekris Net4521) that has two 802.11b wireless interfaces, each hosting
a different wireless network (ESS/Extended Service Set) and a different
subnet. One router interface will be acting as the HA, and the other
will be acting as a visited (foreign) network. Figure 1 shows the two
machines used, and Figure 2 shows the logical setup.

Figure 2. The MN on the Home Link (before Moving)
</p></div></div><p>
For simplicity, let's leave out advanced configurations, such as IP
Security (IPsec) and Route Optimization (RO), and establish only the most
basic MIP setup. We'll not use a standalone CN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e17580.0x1f0fea0"></a>
Installation&mdash;Kernel-Space</h2></div></div><p>
Installing the kernel part of MIPL for both the HA and the MN is exactly
the same. First, download the kernel source tree against which the latest
MIPL patch was taken (2.6.16, in my case), and patch it with the MIPL patch
(version 2.0.2, in my case). Configure the kernel with the features needed
for each machine, ensuring that the following configuration features are included (the script chkconf_kernel.sh, included in the MIPL user
space tarball, can do the checking for you):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
NET_KEY, NET_KEY_MIGRATE, XFRM and XFRM_USER XFRM_ENHANCEMENT: those add
Internet Key Exchange (IKE) support that is needed for dynamically
configuring IPsec. IPsec can be used optionally to secure MIPv6.
</p></li><li><p>
IPV6_MIP6: this adds support for the Mobility Header (MH) protocol and
the other IPv6 protocol extension headers MIPv6 demands.
</p></li><li><p>
IPV6_ADVANCED_ROUTER: this enables the selection of advanced routing
capabilities, such as policy routing.
</p></li><li><p>
IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES: this adds support for policy routing, an advanced
routing feature that enables routing based on fields other than the
destination address.
</p></li><li><p>
IPV6_SUBTREES: this adds source routing support, which is needed for
sending traffic directly to the Mobile Node (without passing through the
Home Network) when MIP is operating the Route Optimization (RO) mode.
</p></li><li><p>
IPV6_TUNNEL: IPv6 in IPv6 tunnel, which is needed for the HA to MN
communication.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Build, install and reboot into the new kernel:


<pre     class="programlisting">

[raven]# wget

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e17580.0x1f10528"></a>
Installation&mdash;User-Space</h2></div></div><p>
To build the Mobility D&aelig;mon, follow the steps you would do for any autotools
built package: <tt  >unzip</tt>, <tt  >untar</tt>,
<tt  >cd</tt> to the directory of the package,
<tt  >./configure</tt>, <tt  >make</tt> and then
<tt  >make install</tt> (read the included INSTALL
document for the details). Follow the same procedure for building and
installing the Router Advertisement D&aelig;mon, radvd. With that finished,
you should
have both MIPL components (kernel and user-space) and radvd installed,
and you now are ready to start configuring.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e17580.0x1f10840"></a>
Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
To start off
simply, let's begin without Route Optimization (RO), without 
IPsec and with a manually configured HA address in the MN. Once we
have the basic setup working, we can enhance and expand
it incrementally. Keep in mind that in the real world, like on the Internet or in
enterprise networks, RO and IPsec are essential. In production networks,
you also might desire other extensions, such as Fast Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6)
or Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), although those aren't implemented
by MIPL.
</p><p>
Let's configure local parameters first, then Layer 2 parameters
and finally Layer 3 parameters. 
</p><p>
First, let's do the Home Agent configuration (denali), 
Host State (sysctl).
At the outset, we need to put the HA in the right state of mind and
configure the HA machine to operate as a router, so we need to
turn on packet forwarding. We'll do this by setting the variable
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding, using one of the following two
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[denali]# echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding
[denali]# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
</pre>
</p><p>
You could make those settings permanent across reboots by editing
/etc/sysctl.conf.
</p><p>
Now, let's configure Layer 2 (the Data Link Layer) parameters (Listing 1). We'll
assign each wireless interface a different wireless network ID (ESSID)
and sufficiently space their frequency channels apart to avoid inter-cell
interference.

          Tx excessive retries:10  Invalid misc:6767   Missed beacon:0
</pre></div><p>
Our next step is to configure the Layer 3 (Network Layer) parameters. This
includes addressing, configuring the Router Advertisement D&aelig;mon and
configuring the Mobility D&aelig;mon.
To configure addressing, use the commands shown in Listing 2.

          Interrupt:11 Base address:0x140
</pre></div><p>
To configure router advertisements, edit the /etc/radvd.conf
file, as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
interface wlan0
{
        AdvSendAdvert on;
        AdvIntervalOpt on;

        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
        MinRtrAdvInterval 1;
        MinDelayBetweenRAs 1;
        AdvHomeAgentFlag on;

        prefix 2001:db8::/64
        {
        AdvOnLink on;
        AdvAutonomous on;
        AdvRouterAddr on;
        };
};

interface wlan1
{
        AdvSendAdvert on;
        AdvIntervalOpt on;

        MaxRtrAdvInterval 10;
        MinRtrAdvInterval 1;
        MinDelayBetweenRAs 1;
        AdvHomeAgentFlag off;

        prefix 2001:db8:1::/64
        {
        AdvOnLink on;
        AdvAutonomous on;
        AdvRouterAddr on;
        };
};
</pre>
</p><p>
In the stanza pertaining to wlan0, you
can see that we have enabled router advertisements on the interface by
setting AdvSendAdvert. We also have configured the interface to operate as
an HA by setting AdvHomeAgentFlag. The other wireless interface, wlan1,
is configured similarly, except that AdvHomeAgentFlag isn't set. Note
that the more frequent the router advertisements are, the faster movement
can be detected but they generate more overhead.
</p><p>
Now launch the router advertisement d&aelig;mon, radvd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[denali]# radvd -C /etc/radvd.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
To configure the Mobility D&aelig;mon, we need to edit the /etc/mip6d.conf
file, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
NodeConfig HA;

## If set to &gt; 0, will not detach from tty
DebugLevel 0;

## List of interfaces where we serve as Home Agent
Interface "wlan0";
UseMnHaIPsec disabled;
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that we merely indicated that the
machine is an HA and specified the interface that will be operating as
an HA. By launching the Mobility D&aelig;mon, the router is set to fulfill
its duty as a faithful HA:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[denali]# mip6d -c /etc/mip6d -d 7
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's move on to the Mobile Node Configuration (raven), Host State
(sysctl).
Just as with the HA, we'll start by establishing the mindset of the
MN. First, we must configure the MN to accept Router Advertisements
(RAs) to be able to configure a CoA and discover and track
default routers on the link automatically:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[raven]# echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/accept_ra
[raven]# sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=1
</pre>
</p><p>
To make the changes permanent across reboots, edit /etc/sysctl.conf.
</p><p>
Next, let's configure Layer 2 parameters.
We'll configure the MN as a wireless client (a managed wireless node)
of the Home network:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[raven]# iwconfig wlan0 mode managed essid "home"
[raven]# iwconfig wlan0

wlan0     IEEE 802.11b  ESSID:"home"
          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.422 GHz  Access Point:
00:02:6F:06:0B:CF
          Bit Rate:11 Mb/s   Sensitivity=1/3
          Retry min limit:8   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:off
          Link Quality=48/92  Signal level=-63 dBm  Noise level=-100 dBm
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:175   Missed beacon:0
</pre>
</p><p>
And, finally, let's configure Layer 3 parameters.
We'll start by assigning the HoA to the wireless interface:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[raven]# ifconfig wlan0 inet6 add 2001:db8::beef/64
[raven]# ifconfig wlan0 ; ifconfig ip6tnl1

          Interrupt:17 Base address:0x2100

          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 b)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)
</pre>
</p><p>
On the MN, an automatically created tunnel interface, called ip6tnl1
(IPv6 Tunnel 1), represents the tunneling process described above. This interface claims no global addresses when the MN is
in the Home network and assumes the HoA when the MN is away.
</p><p>
The primary mobility configuration parameters are the Home Address (HoA)
and the Home Agent (HA) address. To configure them, we need to edit the
/etc/mip6d.conf file as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
NodeConfig MN;

DebugLevel 7;

UseMnHaIPsec disabled;
DoRouteOptimizationMN disabled;
DoRouteOptimizationCN disabled;

Interface "wlan0";
MnHomeLink "wlan0" {

Operation</h2></div></div><p>
Now the scene is complete, and we can start experimenting with
mobility. Before we start, remember the following about MIP: movement
detection is the trigger; binding updating (registration) is the
action. We'll start by letting the MN move, then check whether movement
was detected. Upon witnessing movement detection, we'll check
whether a BU was established successfully. Figure 2 shows the
network's state before moving. To simulate movement, we use iwconfig
to switch the MN's wireless interface from one ESS (wireless cell)
to another:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[raven]# iwconfig wlan0 essid "remote"
</pre>
</p><p>
Upon moving, the wireless interface should acquire a new address, and a new
default gateway should appear (Listing 3).

Using a packet capturing tool
(sniffer), such as tcpdump, we should see a different router appearing
on the link. The Mobility D&aelig;mon log messages should indicate movement
detection (md in the logs stands for movement detection). Now that the
MN has detected movement and acquired a new CoA address, it should send
a BU to its HA. A sniffer should be able to display the BU message as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
IP6 2001:db8:1:0:205:5dff:fef2:db2b &gt; 2001:db8::: 
 &#8618;DSTOPT mobility: BU seq#=54814 AH lifetime=262140
IP6 2001:db8:: &gt; 2001:db8:1:0:205:5dff:fef2:db2b: srcrt

 &#8618;mobility: BA status=0 seq#=54814 lifetime=262140
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition, the Mobility D&aelig;mon should have a BU List
Entry (BULE) that shows the HoA, CoA and HA addresses:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[raven]# telnet localhost 7777
Trying 127.0.0.1...

Escape character is '^]'.

mip6d&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
We can see whether the BU was received and accepted by looking at the HA's
Mobility D&aelig;mon log messages and by displaying the HA's BC:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[denali]# telnet localhost 7777
mip6d&gt; bc
mip6d&gt; bc

 &#8618;mpa 13133 / 13221 retry 0
mip6d&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
As shown above, the Mobility D&aelig;mon provides a
virtual terminal interface to its internal data structures that you can
access by a establishing a Telnet session to port 7777. Figure 3 shows
the network's state after moving.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9914f3.large.jpg"><img src="9914f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Testing</h2></div></div><p>
We can't conclude a networking experiment without some action from our
old crony ping. From the MN, we'll start by sending ping requests to
the HA interface, while the MN is on the home link. We'll then move
and see what happens. This exercise is shown as follows: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
[raven]# ping6 2001:db8::

64 bytes from 2001:db8::: icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=3.72 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::: icmp_seq=8 ttl=64 time=3.70 ms
ping: sendmsg: Invalid argument
ping: sendmsg: Invalid argument
ping: sendmsg: Invalid argument
ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted
64 bytes from 2001:db8::: icmp_seq=13 ttl=63 time=142 ms
64 bytes from 2001:db8::: icmp_seq=14 ttl=63 time=122 ms
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that
in responding to ping requests, the HA interface is actually acting as a
CN. Note how, upon the handover, the MN loses connectivity for some time,
called the handover latency, and then re-establishes it. Note also how
the delay increases tremendously as the MN moves.
</p><p>
A more interesting test is to use a program that sends video like VLC
or GnomeMeeting and visually assess how smooth the handover is. Although
the ultimate goal of MIPv6 is to achieve smooth and lossless handover,
in reality, there is a blackout period during which packets are lost or
delayed. Much of the effort put into developing and standardizing MIPv6 is
to enhance the smoothness of the handover and ultimately achieve seamless
handover. As with any other technology, realizing the limitations is as
crucial as recognizing the value.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Internet Protocol, merged nets into the global metanet we
called the Internet. IP provided connectivity that is independent on
the underlying hardware and the served applications. The homogeneous
addressing of IP and its simplicity enabled it to scale. MIP's goal is
to bring to mobility the merits IP brought to connectivity. This means
mobility that can scale to the size of the Internet, is application-independent and is available across heterogeneous wired and wireless
access technologies. MIPL provides a free and flexible platform for you
to participate in pursuing that vision.
Happy and seamless roaming!
