Why &ldquo;triple play&rdquo; is an obsolete telecom offering.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe7e580.0xf76300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Telephony, our theme this month, used to be a standalone utility. You got
it from the phone company. The same went for cable TV. You got that from the
cable company. Both were service monopolies&mdash;utilities, essentially. If you
wanted something fixed, you called your sole provider, just like you called
the water, gas or electric company.
</p><p>
But, the Internet was different. The first ISPs piggybacked their Net
connections over phone lines. They'd install banks of modems to call or
rent a T1 or a T3 line from a telco or somebody with a
&ldquo;backbone&rdquo;
connection and sell hunks of bandwidth on those. Now much of that old
intermediation is gone, and most of us see the Net as something we get from
the phone or cable company.
</p><p>
As hot as the Internet is, and as important as it has become to nearly
every activity you can name (business, medicine, education, science,
culture and so on), the telcos and cablecos treat it as a third-banana service
behind telephony and television. When they bundle all three together, they
call it triple play. And the Internet comes third.
</p><p>
In one of our features this month (see page 42), Bob Frankston talks about moving entirely
past games like these. But, what to do in the meantime if we do want to
play? Here near Boston, I have my own triple play of carrier choices:
Comcast, RCN and Verizon. Out on the poles, Comcast wiring is coax. RCN
and Verizon both deploy fiber-optic cabling. Sounds like an ideal
competitive environment, right? Well, not quite.
</p><p>
At my elbow is the latest mailer from Comcast, a cable company. It pitches
&ldquo;Digital Cable + Phone + Internet&rdquo;. For the third item, it
offers &ldquo;Comcast
High-Speed Internet with PowerBoost&rdquo;. Bandwidth is &ldquo;up to
12Mbps!&rdquo; No
mention of upstream speed.
</p><p>
The next two mailers are from RCN. The first came just before the
Super Bowl. RCN, which brags that it has been &ldquo;all fiber optic for over a
decade&rdquo;, just pitches cable TV with this one&mdash;$35 for 12
months. There's nothing
about Internet at all. The second mailer pitches &ldquo;10Mbps Blazing-Fast
High-Speed Internet&rdquo; and &ldquo;100% Digital Cable TV&rdquo;. Again, no upstream speed.
</p><p>
I don't use either one of them, though I checked both out when we started
renting here last September. The main thing I care about is Internet
connectivity, and for that, neither Comcast nor RCN competed with Verizon's
fiber-optic FiOS. So Verizon got my business. From FiOS, I'm getting 20Mbps
down and 5Mbps up. The best RCN could do on the upstream side (which
mattered most to me) was 2Mbps. Comcast didn't even say what its upstream
speed was. (I just checked again on-line, and it still doesn't.)
</p><p>
What's amazing to me is that Greater Boston&mdash;specifically in the areas
served by Verizon with FiOS and RCN with its fiber cabling&mdash;is thick with
people like Bob and myself, who care far more about Internet connectivity
than about TV or landline telephone. We have lots of tech and creative
folks
around here, in addition to the thickest concentration of educational
institutions in the country, if not the world. Couldn't these carriers
bother to customize better Internet offerings for a Net-savvy (and -hungry)
local population?
</p><p>
I guess they don't have to. Even with three competitors, there seems to be
enough business to go around. They aren't ready to abandon the scaled
efficiencies of offering the same thing to everybody, across the whole
country. And, as Bob points out, the flywheels of Business As Usual at
telcos still spin on momentum imparted by railroads in the Victorian Age.
</p><p>
But, unlike Bob, I have some hope for them. The time will come when the
workarounds that Bob's talking about&mdash;especially from folks such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers&mdash;will have the carriers looking for ways to make money
other than by tiered pricing for usage alone.
</p><p>
Is low-latency to servers an advantage? One can imagine applications where
it would be. Well, these incumbent carriers not only have home connections, but
also local real-estate holdings. They could provide Akamai-like low-latency Web
services&mdash;or partner with the likes of Akamai to provide them. They could
partner with Amazon's S3 and EC2 (both Linux-based) to offer local storage
and compute back end.
</p><p>
Offsite backup is going to be a huge necessity and, therefore, a cause for
business offerings. Think about what will happen as soon as ordinary folks
start demanding, shooting and cooperatively editing truly high-definition
video. Storage, mirroring and the rest of it will all be helpful, if not
required.
</p><p>
Of course, the amount of business to be had here will increase with the
openness of the Net itself. Today's crippled and asymmetrical throughput,
based on the one-way model of television viewing, is a bug that needs to be
squashed. So does the practice of blocking port 80 and otherwise preventing
or discouraging Web servers at homes and businesses. When that happens,
every customer, every user, becomes a potential partner. By necessity.
</p><p>
There is no limit to how many multiples of the current triple play will
be made possible by a wide-open and free Internet. Here's hoping the
carriers see that before they die under the rubble of their own fallen
silos.
