Norman Matloff and P.J. Salzman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Debugging with GDB/DDD</em></span> (No Starch
Press)</h2></div></div><p>
The new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Debugging with GDB/DDD</em></span> by Norman Matloff and P.J. Salzman,
published by No Starch Press, highlights the importance of debugging to
successful software development. Focusing on GDB, a popular open-source
debugger, the book shows developers how to reduce the time they spend
finding and fixing programming errors. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Debugging</em></span>'s approach is to apply
a range of real-world coding errors, from simple typos to major logical
blunders, to illustrate how to manage memory, understand core dumps
and trace programming errors to their root causes. The book also
covers topics missing from other debugging books, such as threaded,
server/client, GUI and parallel programming.

Cohesive Flexible Technologies' Elastic Server On-Demand Community
Edition</h2></div></div><p>
Fresh out of beta is Cohesive Flexible Technologies' Elastic Server
On-Demand (ESOD) Community Edition virtualization platform. The product
is a free Internet platform for independent developers and individual
enterprise developers to take advantage of virtualization and cloud
computing utilities like Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud. Users can
&ldquo;take their application stack 'recipes', capture them, and reproduce
them as virtual servers rapidly and automatically&rdquo;, says CohesiveFT's
CTO. The firm claims to be the &ldquo;first service to offer developers and
operations complete control of their server assembly, independent of which
virtualization or cloud technology they require.&rdquo; The ESOD Community
Edition is free to use and is intended for individual developers and
noncommercial, nonproduction use.

TotalView Technologies' Workbench Manager</h2></div></div><p>
Adding to its rich portfolio of debugging tools, TotalView Technologies
has released Workbench Manager, an application that allows developers
to create an integrated, cohesive view of the development and debugging
work-flow process. One can manage any version of TotalView Debugger,
MemoryScape memory debugger and any third-party application used for
development and debugging, all from a single dashboard-like GUI. As a
result, you easily can integrate both commercial and open-source tools
in your toolchain. TotalView Technologies' products can be used to
debug Linux, Mac OS X and UNIX applications running on development
machines with single, dual-core, multicore or multiple processors.

Gary E. Sherman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Desktop GIS</em></span> (Pragmatic Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
A book on a specific Linux topic typically means it's on the cusp of
breaking out. Such is the case with Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
the focus of the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Desktop GIS: Mapping the Planet with Open Source
Tools</em></span> by Gary E. Sherman and the Pragmatic Bookshelf. The book's purpose
is to help you deal with the issues involved in assembling your GIS
toolkit, such as choosing the right platform and tools, dealing with
integration issues and getting support. Sherman introduces the main
open-source applications, such as GRASS, Quantum GIS, uDig and others,
and also delves into scripting with various languages. The author is
the founder of the Quantum GIS Project.

ADLINK Technology's ALS-3206 Rackmount Network Security Platform</h2></div></div><p>
ADLINK Technology has just beefed up your options for network security,
adding the ALS-3206 Rackmount Network Security Platform to its solutions
palette. The ALS-3206 series is billed as a flexible, mid-range,
cost-effective solution for IDS, IPS, UTM, firewall, VPN gateway,
load balancing and traffic-mining applications. The line further
supports several Intel processors and chipsets and provides six gigabit
Ethernet ports, one PCI extension slot and two configurable PCI-X slots.
One of the PCI-X extension slots can be configured to extend a four-port
gigabit Ethernet card and the other to extend a network security
accelerator. This combination of features is suited, says ADLINK,
for antivirus software security, content security and PKI software
applications.

Open-Xchange Community Edition</h2></div></div><p>
You can feel the trembling emanating from Redmond after Open-Xchange's
announcement of its newly GPL'd Open-Xchange Community Edition (OXCE).
Open-Xchange calls OXCE &ldquo;the only remaining independent open-source
alternative to Microsoft Exchange&rdquo; and offers the necessary tools to
facilitate communication and teamwork: e=mail, calendaring, contacts,
tasks and document sharing. The company further cites its intuitive
tools and intelligent features, such as smart links between calendar
appointments, task lists, contacts, documents, bookmarks, knowledge
articles and Ajax-based mashup capabilities by Netvibes' Universal Widget
API (UWA). Initially, OXCE is available for Debian and Ubuntu, with
additional Linux distribution support coming later.

Sybase's Adaptive Server Enterprise Cluster Edition</h2></div></div><p>
If downtime ain't an option for your database, Sybase hopes you'll deploy
its new Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) Cluster Edition. The technology
enables enterprises to deploy database environments across shared servers
in a cluster, which offers the added benefit of optimal service through
events such as system failures, peak loads and planned maintenance.
In addition, Sybase's product allows for savings in hardware and
power costs through optimal resource utilization. Another technology,
Virtualized Resource Management, supplies application workloads with
a virtual view of the physical cluster that can be changed
dynamically on demand. ASE Cluster Edition is available for Red Hat and SUSE Linux,
as well as 64-bit Solaris.
