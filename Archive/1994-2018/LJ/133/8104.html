How can desktop and laptop hardware vendors become
profitable again? Linspire suggests grabbing some of
the desktop software business.

After years gunning up and down the runway, it looks
like Linux on the laptop finally may take off. I
sensed some lift under the wings just in the first
few months of this year. We reviewed HP's first
Linux laptop in January 2005, and we're told more are
on the way. Novell, which last year made a public
commitment to running their entire company on Linux,
made that commitment visible at LinuxWorld Expo
in February 2005. A large percentage of the computers in
the Novell booth were IBM ThinkPads in the same T40
family as my own (an EmperorLinux Toucan). By the time
I left, the Novell folks had upgraded my SuSE 9.1 to
the company's own SUSE 9.2-based Novell Desktop. I'm
still shaking down a few minor glitches, but overall
it works remarkably well. As a constant traveler
who connects to the Net by ad hoc Wi-Fi, I'm in love
(no pun intended) with Robert Love's netapplet,
which comes standard with the Novell Linux Desktop.
See the description and screenshot in this issue's Up Front Section.
</p><p>
At Apachecon last fall, I detected a drop in
the percentage of Apple OS X Powerbooks, clearly
the preferred box the year prior, and a rise in
the percentage of Linux laptops. The consensus,
among those I talked to about it, was that Linux
was getting better for laptops. Power control with
the 2.6 kernel got some of the credit, as did a
growing assortment of available device drivers. And,
so did a maturing portfolio of applications that
offer straight-up alternatives to familiar goods
on OS X and Microsoft Windows&mdash;or, better yet,
application bridges to Linux. OpenOffice.org is an
obvious example, but there are others, such as Nvu,
the Web-authoring tool I'm using right now.
</p><p>
But the drag persists on the hardware side,
where we're still repurposing Windows laptops for
Linux. It's not going to be easy to break free of
that. The reasons are economic, not technical.
</p><p>
Ever since &ldquo;PC Compatible&rdquo; became &ldquo;Designed for
Windows&rdquo;, development of desktops and laptops at all
the big hardware OEMs has started with Microsoft,
not anybody else. Certainly not Linux. Every laptop
&ldquo;designed for Windows XP&rdquo; bears Microsoft branding as
bold as the maker's own. This is branding of the same
literal sort that ranchers practice when they burn
their symbols on the hides of cattle. (In fact, cattle
ranching is
where the &ldquo;branding&rdquo; concept came from.)
</p><p>
Branding agreements are just the obvious side of
the Windows Laptop Story. The invisible side is
much more interesting. For example, I'd been told
before&mdash;always on a not-for-attribution basis&mdash;that Microsoft has a long-standing policy of
using &ldquo;marketing dollars&rdquo; to keep hardware OEMs
profitable. Of course, it's been easy for Microsoft
to do that, because their margins have always been
huge. But it's not something anybody on either side
of the arrangement would be eager to talk about.
</p><p>
One CEO who's not in one of those arrangements is
Michael Robertson, founder and CEO of Linspire. I
talked with Michael this February at the Desktop
Summit, which Linspire hosts, in San Diego. &ldquo;There
are all sorts of economic ties involved here that
aren't readily transparent&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;They have the
OEMs strung out on marketing dollars and kickbacks
and stuff like that. Marketing dollars make their
business barely viable. We had a top-ten desktop guy
come to us and say, 'We really want to do Linux, but
we're concerned that if we do this&mdash;whether it's
allowed or not&mdash;it'll upset Microsoft and we'll
lose these revenues.'&rdquo;
</p><p>
But the PC hardware business is becoming more
unprofitable by the day. &ldquo;Look at IBM-Lenovo&rdquo;,
Robertson said. IBM agreed to sell its PC business to
Lenovo, the People's Republic of China's largest PC
builder, at the end of last year. &ldquo;IBM has lost
$33 on every PC they've sold&rdquo;, Robertson said.
&ldquo;We're to a breaking point where some of the OEMs
out there are saying, 'Enough is enough. I have to
get at least $50 better economics.' What can they
do? Manufacture in China? Use cheaper parts? They
already do that. They need cheaper software. Same with
HP. If the PC business was doing well, Carly would
still have a job. What they need now is a piece of
the software business.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It isn't easy for any company, even a desperate one,
to leave money on the table. But that's exactly what
Linspire is asking the hardware OEMs to do. &ldquo;They
have to really believe that the Linux opportunity
is sufficiently large to trump that guaranteed check
they get from Microsoft&rdquo;, Robertson said.
</p><p>
So far, none of the OEMs has budged. At least not
in a way anybody's ready to talk about. Meanwhile,
Linspire plugs away. &ldquo;It's a case of moving up
the ecosystem&rdquo;, Robertson said. &ldquo;We work with VIA,
the motherboard company. They're happy to work with
us. That domino fell. Then the AMD domino. They're
happy to work with us too.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I talked with folks at the AMD and VIA booths at the
Desktop Summit, and it was clear that both companies
savored the freedom and opportunity that come with
opting not to run their goods through the Microsoft
mill. Their attitude was much the same as I saw
from the makers of Linux-based home media centers
at CES one month earlier (see &ldquo;The No-Party
System&rdquo;, in the April 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>).
</p><p>
I asked Michael Robertson about NVIDIA and ATI, the
big graphics subsystem companies. He smiled and said,
&ldquo;Other dominoes will fall too. The last will be the
major record labels. The clue phone has to be ringing
so loud they have no choice but to answer it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Robertson has a lot of experience in the record
business. He founded MP3.com and got rich by selling
it to a record company that went on to kill it. Now
he's back in the business again, with a companion to
Linspire called MP3tunes. But where Linspire goes
straight after Microsoft's business, MP3tunes goes
straight after Apple's.
</p><p>
Like Apple's iTunes, MP3tunes is a store where you
can sample and buy music. Unlike iTunes, MP3tunes
sells music without any digital rights management
(DRM). Where Apple sells music encoded at 128kb AAC,
MP3tunes sells music encoded at 198kb MP3. Where
Apple sells songs at $.99 each and $9.99 per
album, MP3tunes' prices are $.88 and $8.88. And
where Apple's store lives in an application that
runs only on Windows and OS X, MP3tunes lives in
a wide-open Web site, in addition to Linspire's
Lsongs (which runs on Linux and works like Apple's
iTunes). Michael Robertson: &ldquo;Does the world need
another music store? Yes. Because most of them are
rental shops. They control what you can do with it,
what you can copy it to. I think if you pay money for
music, you should be able to use it any way you want,
on any device....I like the model where, if you pay
for the music, it's yours. Forever.&rdquo;
</p><p>
MP3tunes also distributes music from CD Baby, a
company that leaves all rights with the artist and
takes only a 9% distribution fee. Customers also get
an MP3tunes &ldquo;music locker&rdquo; that remembers everything
bought from the service. This allows the customer to
download the same songs again, as many times as they
like, to any device.
</p><p>
Naturally, Robertson sees Apple as no less controlling
toward the music business than Microsoft is toward
the operating system business:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It's not iTunes. It's theirTunes. Apple's
controlling whether you can play it on this
portable device, whether you can copy it to
a Linux computer&mdash;which you can't, by the
way. I did send an e-mail to Steve Jobs, saying
&ldquo;Hey Steve, how about supporting AAC and iTunes
on Linux?&rdquo; To give him credit, he did reply back
to me...a one-word answer. It was &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo; That's
it. Not even a hi or a bye. Just &ldquo;Nope.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
MP3tunes is fighting Apple on the playback side as
well. Where iTunes is designed to run only on iPods
and the PCs to which they attach, MP3tunes supports
playing any music on any device.
</p><p>
At the show, they demonstrated that advantage with
a new product called MP3beamer. It's a Linux-based
music storage system that distributes music over
Wi-Fi. You can buy the software on-line for $69.95
($10 more in a box). Or, you can buy hardware with
the software preinstalled. The demo hardware at the
show was a compact $399 box from sub300.com&mdash;and
a Linksys Wi-Fi boom box. The Linksys comes with a
display that shows the tunes being played (along with
other information) and a remote control that operates
the base unit through the boom box. The Linksys also
has audio-out plugs you can run into a home stereo.
</p><p>
I also was curious at the show to see how Linspire's
newest distro version worked on the VIA-based eCom
notebook computer they had loaned me two years ago.
Kendall Dawson, a &ldquo;community liaison&rdquo;
specialist with Linspire, helped me out by bringing
a CD drive to the show, attaching it to the notebook
(it doesn't have an internal drive) and loading the
Linspire 5.0 beta distro. Everything went smoothly,
and the rejuvenated notebook immediately met my
minimum laptop requirements: 1) it saw and connected
to the Net through the Wi-Fi card in its PCMCIA slot;
2) it hibernated when the lid closed and returned to
its full waking state when the lid opened; 3) it let
me obtain and install the small pile of software I
wanted to run&mdash;and did it far more easily than any
Linux distro I've ever used.
</p><p>
There were still a few small problems. It didn't
recognize my digital camera's memory card when I
plugged a reader in to a USB port. Same with the Flash
memory stick that also serves as the laptop-side
interface for a remote controller I use to operate
slide shows. Then again, it's not easy to get my
ThinkPad T40 running SuSE (9.1) to do the same things.
</p><p>
The Linspire laptop also immediately ran CNR (Click
'N Run), a software warehouse and installation system
for more than 2,000 packages, most of which are free
(as in beer). I logged in, it remembered me, and
I have been downloading stuff ever since. The system
is the first I've seen that actually does a simpler
and easier job of installing software than Windows
or even OS X. Because Linspire is built on Debian, it
manages packages with apt-get. Earlier versions had
standalone apt-get functionality, but because users run
as root in Linspire, this caused problems. So apt-get
functionality is commented out in 5.0. Expert users,
of course, can fix that.
</p><p>
What encouraged me most at the show, however,
wasn't on the floor. It was at a tour of Linspire's
offices. At one end of a long open space cluttered
with desks and geek debris was a counter populated
by about 15 laptops and notebooks, each with
performance charts taped to their lids. All the
units were going through QA testing and burn-in on
Linspire 5.0. I felt like I was watching <span   class="emphasis"><em>Invasion of
the Body Snatchers</em></span>, except in this case, the invaders
were the good guys.
</p><p>
They're making headway. The $199 Linux box that
Fry's Electronics advertises almost every week comes
with Linspire as the default OS. Linspire is also on
a $498 laptop sold at WalMart.com. Recently I also
received a confidential report about Linspire running
on desktops in a large company. When I asked Michael
Robertson about that, he said, &ldquo;We're in a lot more
companies than you'd think.&rdquo; But he declined to name
names to spare those companies unwanted visits from
Microsoft sales people.
</p><p>
Two years ago, at the first Summit, my only problem
with Linspire was its narrow focus on end users,
almost to the exclusion of the established Linux
community. Since then, they've become much more
friendly to the community, though I think they
still could do more. For example, I'd like to see them
showing up at other Linux and open-source events
and working more with publications and Web sites that
serve the Linux community.
</p><p>
The idea here is for Linspire to get adoption by the
hard-core experts who read <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It's to
provide those experts with a version of Linux they
can give to their non-expert parents and friends. If
you want Linux adoption, there's no better leverage
than you'll get from a Linux expert.
