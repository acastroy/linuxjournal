How do you read and write files from a kernel module?
Wait, make that &ldquo;how would you read and write files
from a kernel module if that weren't a bad thing to do?&rdquo;
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d2580.0x1aca3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
On Linux kernel programming mailing lists oriented toward new developers
(see the on-line Resources),
a number of common questions are asked.
Almost every time one of these questions is asked,
the response always is, &ldquo;Don't do that!&rdquo;, leaving the
bewildered questioner wondering what kind of strange
development community they have stumbled into. This
is the first in an occasional series of articles that
attempts to explain why it generally is not a good idea
to do these kinds of things. Then, in order
to make up for the chastising, we break all of
the rules and show you exactly how to do them anyway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d2580.0x1aca558"></a>
Read a File</h2></div></div><p>
The most common question asked in this don't-do-that
category is, &ldquo;How do I read a file from within my
kernel module?&rdquo; Most new kernel developers are
coming from user-space programming environments or
other operating systems where reading a file is a
natural and essential part of bringing configuration
information into a program. From within
the Linux kernel, however, reading data out of a file for
configuration information is considered to be forbidden.
This is due to a vast array of different problems that could result
if a developer tries to do this.
</p><p>
The most common problem is interpreting the data.
Writing a file interpreter from within the kernel is a process
ripe for problems, and any errors in that interpreter
can cause devastating crashes. Also, any errors
in the interpreter could cause buffer overflows. These might allow
unprivileged users to take over a machine or get access to protected
data, such as password files.
</p><p>
Trying to protect the kernel from dumb programming errors is not the most important
reason for not allowing drivers to read files. The
biggest issue is policy. Linux kernel programmers
try to flee from the word policy as fast as they
can. They almost never want to force the kernel to
force a policy on to user space that can possibly be
avoided. Having a module read a file from a
filesystem at a specific location forces the policy
of the location of that file to be set. If a Linux
distributor decides the easiest way to handle
all configuration files for the system is to place
them in the /var/black/hole/of/configs, this
kernel module has to be modified to support
this change. This is unacceptable to the Linux
kernel community.
</p><p>
Another big issue with trying to read a file from
within the kernel is trying to figure out exactly
where the file is. Linux supports filesystem
namespaces, which allow every process to contain its
own view of the filesystem. This allows some
programs to see only portions of the entire
filesystem, while others see the filesystem in
different locations. This is a powerful
feature, and trying to determine that your module
lives in the proper filesystem namespace
is an impossible task.
</p><p>
If these big issues are not enough, the
final problem of how to get the configuration into the
kernel is also a policy decision. By forcing the
kernel module to read a file every time, the author is
forcing that decision. However, some distributions
might decide it is better to store system
configurations in a local database and have helper
programs funnel that data into the kernel at the
proper time. Or, they might want to connect to an
external machine in some manner to determine the
proper configuration at that moment. Whatever method
the user decides to employ to store configuration data,
by forcing it to be in a specific file, he or she is
forcing that policy decision on the user, which is a
bad idea.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d2580.0x1aca818"></a>
But How Do I Configure Things?</h2></div></div><p>
After finally understanding the Linux kernel
programmer's aversion to policy decisions and
thinking that those idealists are out of their mind,
you still are left with the real problem of how to
get configuration data into a kernel module. How
can this be done without incurring the wrath of an
angry e-mail flame war?
</p><p>
A common way of sending data to a specific
kernel module is to use a char device and the ioctl
system call. This allows the author to send almost
any kind of data to the kernel, with the
user-space program sending the data at the proper
time in the initialization process. The
ioctl command, however, has been determined to have a lot of
nasty side affects, and creating new ioctls in the kernel generally
is frowned on. Also, trying properly to handle a 32-bit user-space program
making an ioctl call into a 64-bit kernel and
converting all of the data types in the correct
manner is a horrible task to undertake.
</p><p>
Because ioctls are not allowed, the /proc
filesystem can be used to get configuration data
into the kernel. By writing data to a file in the
filesystem created by the kernel module,
the kernel module has direct access to it.
Recently, though, the proc filesystem has been
clamped down on by the kernel developers, as it was
horribly abused by programmers over time to contain
almost any type of data. Slowly this filesystem is
being cleaned up to contain only process
information, such as the names of filesystem states.
</p><p>
For a more structured filesystem, the sysfs
filesystem provides a way for any device and any
driver to create files to which configuration data
may be sent. This interface is preferred over ioctls
and using /proc. See previous articles
in this column for how to create and use sysfs files
within a kernel module.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d2580.0x1acaa28"></a>
I Want to Do This Anyway</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you understand the reasoning behind
forbidding the ability to read a file from a kernel
module, you of course can skip the rest of
this article. It does not concern you, as
you are off busily converting your kernel module to
use sysfs.
</p><p>
Still here? Okay, so you still want to know how to
read a file from a kernel module, and no amount of
persuading can convince you otherwise. You promise
never to try to do this in code that will be
submitted for inclusion into the main kernel tree
and that I never described how to do this, right?
</p><p>
Actually, reading a file is quite simple, once one
minor issue is resolved. A number of
the kernel system calls are exported for module use;
these system calls start with sys_. So, for the
read system call, the function sys_read should be
used.
</p><p>
The common approach to reading a file is to
try code that looks like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fd = sys_open(filename, O_RDONLY, 0);
if (fd &gt;= 0) {
  /* read the file here */
  sys_close(fd);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
However, when this is tried within a kernel module,
the sys_open() call usually returns the error
-EFAULT. This causes the author to post the
question to a mailing list, which elicits the
&ldquo;don't read a file from the kernel&rdquo; response described above.
</p><p>
The main thing the author forgot to take into
consideration is the kernel expects the pointer passed to the
sys_open() function call to be coming from user space. So, it makes a check
of the pointer to verify it is in the proper
address space in order to try to convert it to a kernel
pointer that the rest of the kernel can use. So,
when we are trying to pass a kernel pointer to the
function, the error -EFAULT occurs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d2580.0x1acad98"></a>
Fixing the Address Space</h2></div></div><p>
To handle this address space mismatch, use the functions
get_fs() and set_fs(). These
functions modify the current process address
limits to whatever the caller wants.
In the case of sys_open(), we want to tell the kernel
that pointers from within the kernel address space
are safe, so we call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set_fs(KERNEL_DS);
</pre>
</p><p>
The only two valid options for the set_fs() function
are KERNEL_DS and USER_DS, roughly standing for
kernel data segment and user data segment, respectively.
</p><p>
To determine what the current address
limits are before modifying them, call the get_fs()
function. Then, when the kernel module is
done abusing the kernel API, it can restore the
proper address limits.
</p><p>
So, with this knowledge, the proper way to write the
above code snippet is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
old_fs = get_fs();
set_fs(KERNEL_DS);

fd = sys_open(filename, O_RDONLY, 0);
if (fd &gt;= 0) {
  /* read the file here */
  sys_close(fd);
}
set_fs(old_fs);
</pre>
</p><p>
An example of an entire module that reads the file
/etc/shadow and dumps it out to the kernel system
log, proving that this can be a dangerous thing to
do, can be seen below:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/syscalls.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;asm/uaccess.h&gt;

static void read_file(char *filename)
{
  int fd;
  char buf[1];

  mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs();
  set_fs(KERNEL_DS);

  fd = sys_open(filename, O_RDONLY, 0);
  if (fd &gt;= 0) {
    printk(KERN_DEBUG);
    while (sys_read(fd, buf, 1) == 1)
      printk("%c", buf[0]);
    printk("\n");
    sys_close(fd);
  }
  set_fs(old_fs);
}

static int __init init(void)
{
  read_file("/etc/shadow");
  return 0;
}

static void __exit exit(void)
{ }

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
module_init(init);
module_exit(exit);

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d2580.0x1acb108"></a>
But What about Writing?</h2></div></div><p>
Now, armed with this newfound knowledge of
how to abuse the kernel system call API and annoy a
kernel programmer at the drop of a hat, you really can
push your luck and write to a file from within the kernel.
Fire up your favorite editor, and pound out something like the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
old_fs = get_fs();
set_fs(KERNEL_DS);

fd = sys_open(filename, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0644);
if (fd &gt;= 0) {
  sys_write(data, strlen(data);
  sys_close(fd);
}
set_fs(old_fs);
</pre>
</p><p>
The code seems to build properly, with no compile
time warnings, but when you try to load the module,
you get this odd error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
insmod: error inserting 'evil.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in module
</pre>
</p><p>
This means that a symbol your module is trying
to use has not been exported and is not available in the
kernel. By looking at the kernel log, you can
determine what symbol that is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
evil: Unknown symbol sys_write
</pre>
</p><p>
So, even though the function sys_write is present in
the syscalls.h header file, it is not exported for
use in a kernel module. Actually, on three different
platforms this symbol is exported, but who really
uses a parisc architecture anyway? To work around
this, we need to take advantage of the kernel
functions that are available to kernel modules. By
reading the code of how the sys_write function is
implemented, the lack of the exported symbol can be
thwarted. The following kernel module shows how
this can be done by not using the sys_write call:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/syscalls.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/file.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/fs.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;asm/uaccess.h&gt;

static void write_file(char *filename, char *data)
{
  struct file *file;
  loff_t pos = 0;
  int fd;

  mm_segment_t old_fs = get_fs();
  set_fs(KERNEL_DS);

  fd = sys_open(filename, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT, 0644);
  if (fd &gt;= 0) {
    sys_write(fd, data, strlen(data));
    file = fget(fd);
    if (file) {
      vfs_write(file, data, strlen(data), &amp;pos);
      fput(file);
    }
    sys_close(fd);
  }
  set_fs(old_fs);
}

static int __init init(void)
{
  write_file("/tmp/test", "Evil file.\n");
  return 0;
}

static void __exit exit(void)
{ }

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
module_init(init);
module_exit(exit);

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, by using the functions fget, fput
and vfs_write, we can implement our own sys_write
functionality.

I Never Told You about This</h2></div></div><p>
In conclusion, reading and writing a file from within
the kernel is a bad, bad thing to do. Never do it.
Ever. Both modules from this article, along with
a Makefile for compiling them, are available from
the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site, but we expect to see no
downloads in the logs. And, I never told you how to
do it either. You picked it up from someone else,
who learned it from his sister's best friend,
who heard about how to do it from her coworker.
