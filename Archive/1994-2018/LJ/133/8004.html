Move along, nothing to see here. Some Firefox
preferences are just too technical for end users.
Oh, you're a <i  >Linux Journal</i> reader? Come on in.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2053580.0x214b3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Firefox Web browser, built by the Mozilla
Foundation and friends is a complicated piece
of technology&mdash;if you care to look under the hood.
It's not obvious where the hood catch is, because the
surface of Firefox (its user interface) is polished
up to appeal to ordinary, nontechnical end users.
This article gives you a glimpse of the engine.
It explains how the Mozilla about:config URL opens
up a world of obscure preferences that can be used
to tweak the default setup.
They're an improbable
collection and therein lies the beauty of Firefox
if you're a grease monkey or otherwise technical.
At the end you'll know a little more about Firefox,
but only enough to be dangerous.
</p><p>
Like any Linux-friendly piece of software, Firefox
responds to preset environment variables. You can,
for example, set the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME or
MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH variables prior to startup.
They both work like the standard PATH, so no
surprises there. The per-process space available
for environment variables is, however, limited, and
a simple textual concatenation of attribute-value
pairs is a fairly inflexible way to store data.
Firefox has a large set of runtime configuration
options, and the environment isn't a suitable
storage area.
</p><p>
Firefox configuration is stored in a small
attribute-type-value database called the preference
system. You can see a delta of this data set
in the ~/.mozilla/firefox/*/prefs.js file. That
file holds only the nondefault values selected by
the user. The rest of the preferences either are
unstated or stated in install files that are part
of the standard install. For me, they're in
/local/install/firefox/defaults/pref, because /local
is my playpen of choice.
</p><p>
For a technical person, this system is a bit
problematic because the full list of preferences
doesn't appear anywhere on disk, and the
standard way to change those preferences is to use
the Firefox User Interface, which also is
incomplete. That interface provides GUI elements
(buttons, fields and check boxes) for only the most
basic of the preferences available. Firefox isn't
trying to be Emacs, after all. The rest of the
preferences have to be dug up from elsewhere.
</p><p>
That other place is the special string
about:config, which can be typed in the Firefox
Location bar where the addresses of Web sites are
entered. Briefly recall the taxonomy of W3C addresses:
URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers) are a special
case of IRIs (International Resource Identifiers).
A URI either can be a URL (a Uniform Resource
Locator) or a URN ( a Uniform Resource Name). It's
URLs that we see all the time. They consist of a
scheme (typically http), a colon (:) and an
address (x.org).
</p><p>
You can define your own scheme. Mozilla does
that for &ldquo;about&rdquo;, which is used to access internal
browser resources. Try about:cache, for example.
The config resource is a hook into the preference
system. When you type about:config, you're navigating
to a local resource just as you would navigate to
a Web-based resource for an HTTP-based Web page.
Figure 1 shows the results of loading the
about:config
resource.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8004f1.large.jpg"><img src="8004f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Firefox Showing the about:config Preferences
</p></div></div><p>
This preference listing is also a form. Right-click on any preference to modify it or to state a
new preference. Shorten the display by entering some text in the Filter box
if you want. Many Firefox extensions
can provide alternate interfaces to about:config. Feel
free to experiment with them.
</p><p>
Nothing is perfect, alas; about:config shows only
preferences that <span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> have been set or
specified <span   class="emphasis"><em>anywhere</em></span>. It doesn't show
preferences that have meaningful uses, which
appear nowhere in the about:config list.
To add a value for a new preference that doesn't
appear, simply right-click anywhere in the main window,
and select New from the context menu, then select
the type of preference: string, integer or Boolean.
</p><p>
Without further ado, here's a tour of preferences
to which the Firefox UI doesn't give you access.
Some are unmasked by about:config; some are not.
They're all relatively safe to experiment with. If
you get into trouble, go back to about:config and
unset the preference, or, in the worst case, shut down
Firefox and delete the prefs.js file noted earlier.
Everything said to this point also applies to other
Mozilla products: the Mozilla Application Suite,
Thunderbird and so on. Hesitate before deleting the
Thunderbird prefs.js file. It contains important
pointers to your e-mail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2053580.0x214ba80"></a>
Tune the Use of Firefox Caches</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a simple preference to begin with. You
can explicitly set the size of the memory part of
Firefox's Web cache. Here's the preference, which
has a type of integer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.cache.memory.capacity
</pre>
</p><p>
Set it to the integral number of KB (Kilobytes)
that you want as a maximum. By default, this
preference is unstated and has a default value of
-1, meaning &ldquo;expand to fill available memory as
required&rdquo;. That's a little like the Linux disk
buffer cache. You might not want that if you're
running OpenOffice.org and Firefox simultaneously and
working both applications hard. If you do change
this preference, you're going the way of Mac OS
9 and lower, where each application gets an
explicit memory allocation. That could be a
tuning burden if you go too far with it.
</p><p>
The Mozilla Web cache (both memory and
disk) is akin to the function of servers like
Squid. That is, both types of cache are smart about
the use of HTTP headers for caching purposes. If
you're in control of the local Web proxy, there's
probably more value in a huge Squid cache than
there is in a really big local disk cache. A bigger
Firefox cache still gives some performance
boost though. You can alter caching use
through the integer preference:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.cache.check_doc_frequency
</pre>
</p><p>
This preference affects when Firefox accesses
the cache, not how the cache itself works. The
cache caches Web content every opportunity it
gets, but if Firefox fails to check it, such
opportunities will come rarely. Set the preference
to 0 for one check per URL resource per Firefox Web
surfing session, 1 always to use the cache, 2 never to
use the cache and 3 (the default) when the
HTTP caching rules says it's a good idea to cache.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2053580.0x214bd98"></a>
Disable Scripting Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
It's possible for a Web page to implement a
denial-of-service attack on the browser user. All
you need is a Web page that runs a heap of JavaScript
in an infinite busy loop. Firefox can't accept user
input when such intensive processing is going on. This
integer preference causes script execution to halt
if it goes on too long. The units are seconds,
and the default is 5:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dom.max_script_run_time
</pre>
</p><p>
You might have Firefox set up to do some tricky Web
spidering. You might have it acting as a bot or
running continuously as an unattended console. In
any of those cases, set this preference to -1, and
Web page scripts run forever unmolested.
</p><p>
The use of various asynchronous mechanisms,
such as setTimeout(), support long scripting
timelines in a normal Web page. There's no need for
preference changes to support such things.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2053580.0x214bfa8"></a>
Disable Favicons and Site Icons</h2></div></div><p>
In the Firefox browser, a tab title, Location Bar
URL or displayed bookmark can acquire a small image
(an icon), which is displayed to its left. Usually it
contains a brand mark for the site of the currently
displayed Web page. You might not want this to
happen. It makes your bookmarks file bigger, and
(especially if you're on dial-up) it causes an extra
HTTP request when the page first is visited. That
request fetches the icon for display. These two
Boolean preferences, both with a default of true, can be set
to false to disable those
fetches and the subsequent icon display:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.chrome.site_icons
browser.chrome.favicons
</pre>
</p><p>
Set either one to false, and these icons are
ignored. Bookmarks get the standard bookmarks
icon, and elsewhere no icon at all appears.
</p><p>
You might ask, &ldquo;Why are there two preferences?&rdquo; Part of the reason is because these
icons can be specified in two ways. You can put a 16x16
pixel Microsoft Windows ICO format icon at this URL:
http://www.example.com/favicon.ico.
</p><p>
That icon will do for all pages on that site and is
officially a Favorites Icon or favicon, to use
Microsoft's term. Alternately, you can add an icon
per page, using a &lt;link&gt; tag and any 16x16 ICO URL,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;link rel="SHORTCUT ICON" href="/images/mybrand.ico" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
For some historical reason, that per-page use is
called a Site Icon.
</p><p>
The other reason for two preferences has to do with
parallel development streams in the Mozilla
Project, the mess that is bookmark file formats
and a shortage of time for trivial cleanup tasks.
We're looking under the hood, remember.

Tune Up the Rendering Engine</h2></div></div><p>
If you have a drop of graphics programming in your
blood, you might spare a kind thought for L. David
Baron, Robert O'Callahan and company&mdash;the core
developers of the Gecko rendering engine inside
Firefox. Displaying a Web page is a fiendish
compromise between standards, performance and
subjective user perceptions. One of the most
difficult constraints that Web pages impose is the
need for incremental display. Show me the Web
page as it arrives, not all at once at the end. This means
constantly reflowing the displayed elements, which
may be delivered out of order (a problem word
processors don't have). Worse, such documents
nearly always are network-delivered with unreliable
timing.
</p><p>
To see the difficulty of this job, visit an image-intense Web site such
as <a href="http://gamespot.com" target="_self">gamespot.com</a>.
Over broadband, the loading page jumps around in an
agony of layout updates while chunky content is
dumped into the browser in no particular order. On
dial-up, the process is slower and more familiar,
but the amount of layout labour is even larger,
because there's more time to adjust each
received fragment of page. Figure 2 shows the image-heavy
GameSpot site, rendered while the images are
still coming in.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8004f2.large.jpg"><img src="8004f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Close-up of a half-received Web site, jumping
around as Firefox updates the layout.
</p></div></div><p>
Given this kind of problem, you can imagine,
therefore, that all kinds of hidden tuning
preferences are available&mdash;if you know where to
find them. This isn't a tuning workshop, so here
are two of the more interesting ones.
</p><p>
It's rare to want to tune down Firefox. (You should
buy your nice mother a better computer.) It's more
likely that you've got lots of CPU and video grunt
and want to use it. You probably click the mouse
more than 2,000 times a day. Theoretically, you can
shave a quarter of a second off your response time&mdash;that's an extra coffee break a day&mdash;with this
integer preference:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nglayout.initialpaint.delay
</pre>
</p><p>
Set this to 0 (zero) milliseconds. It's set to 250
by default. When a Web page starts to trickle in to
the browser, Firefox normally waits a bit after
it has organised the page fragments in memory. It
makes sense to bunch up the first few bits of
content before attempting to show them. If you've
got a quick eye, though, you can make it show what
it's got ready straight away.
</p><p>
Similarly, Firefox buffers up the incoming raw
network content before it bothers to break those
bytes down into something ready for display. That's
another chunking process that saves the CPU but
slows the output on a fast machine. Set this
integer preference to, say, 5,000 (microseconds), and
incoming network bytes are pushed to the
display system much more quickly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
content.notify.interval
</pre>
</p><p>
Doing so, however, makes Firefox work very hard
scheduling updates in response to every drop of
content. If you lower this value too much, that
extra work merely results in the incoming data
buffering further back in the dataflow&mdash;perhaps behind a socket in
the kernel&mdash;while
Firefox thrashes around trying to complete a
whole display update for every trivial character
of text that appears. Lower the preference a bit
at a time, and watch the CPU with top(1), perhaps.

Penetrate the Mystery of Trusted Codebases</h2></div></div><p>
For a long time, Firefox, Mozilla and, before
that, Netscape 4.x, supported this hidden
Boolean preference:

<pre     class="programlisting">
signed.applets.codebase_principle_support
</pre>
</p><p>
Normally, it's set to false&mdash;if you want you can
set it to true. It's a poorly understood
preference, so here's an explanation. First of
all, the name is about as relevant as UNIX's /etc&mdash;it's so steeped in history that it's basically
wrong. There's no applets at work; there's no Java
at work. Mozilla has an amicable separation from
Java, where Netscape 4.x was deeply wedded to that
technology. Mozilla now handles its own security
natively, in C/C++ code. It should be called
signed.content.codebase_principle_support&mdash;one
day, maybe.
</p><p>
This preference is used to assist developers who
work with digitally signed content. It has no
relation to SSL or to PGP/GPG. An example of
signed content is a Web site or Web application
bundled up into JAR format and digitally signed in
that form.
</p><p>
Roughly speaking, two checks are done if
digitally signed content arrives in Firefox. First,
the digital certificate accompanying the content is
checked against Firefox's list of known certificate
authorities (CAs). If that much is fine, the
maker of that content is considered authentic.
Firefox then lets the content request extra
privileges, ones that overcome normal browser
restrictions, like access to the local disk.
Usually that's done through JavaScript.
</p><p>
When those requests are made, Firefox throws up
dialogs to the user. This is when the second
check is done&mdash;it is done manually by the user.
If the user agrees, the content can run with
security restrictions dropped and your computer is
exposed, or at least the currently logged-in
Linux account is exposed.
</p><p>
For a developer, these checks are a nuisance. It's
extra effort to buy (with real dollars) a suitable
certificate for signing the content and set up the
infrastructure. That should be necessary only when
the site goes live.
</p><p>
Instead of using a real digital certificate to sign
the content under development, suppose you use a
dummy certificate&mdash;one that's not authentic. You
can make a dummy certificate with the SignTool
tool, available at <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/security/nss/releases" target="_self">ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/security/nss/releases</a>.
Next, you tell the browser that it's okay to accept
such a dummy certificate. That's what the above
preference does.
</p><p>
Setting this preference weakens only the first
security check. You always
have to perform the user-based check&mdash;at least Firefox offers to
remember what you said after the first time.
Setting this preference means that Firefox
accepts a dummy certificate from any Web site,
so use this only on isolated test equipment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2053580.0x2544fb8"></a>
Read your E-mail from Firefox</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, here's a simple way to set up Thunderbird
access from Firefox. Set this Boolean preference to
true to enable the mailto: URL scheme&mdash;the one that
appears in Web page &ldquo;Contact Me&rdquo; links:

<pre     class="programlisting">
network.protocol-handler.external.mailto
</pre>
</p><p>
An example of a mailto: URL is
mailto:nrm@kingtide.com.au. Secondly, set this string
preference to the path of the Thunderbird executable
or to the path of any suitable executable or shell
script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
network.protocol-handler.app.mailto
</pre>
</p><p>
Digging out hidden preferences is a bit of treasure
hunt. Many are documented on Firefox-friendly Web
pages, but the ultimate authority is the source
code. Preference names are simple strings, and it's
possible to create your own. Many of the extensions
that can be added to Firefox dump extra preferences
into the preference system. As long as the
extension remembers to check and maintain those
preferences, they have the same first-class status
as the ones that have meaning for the standard
Firefox install.
</p><p>
Remember, you always can save a copy of your prefs.js
file before an experimental session with
about:config
and restore the saved copy if things get too weird.
Happy config hacking!
