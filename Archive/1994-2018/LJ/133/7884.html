Language designers rejoice! Now it's easier to put a front end for your
language onto GCC.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fd298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
GCC, the premier free software compiler suite, has undergone many
changes in the last few years. One change in particular, the merging
of the tree-ssa branch, has made it much simpler to write a new GCC
front end.
</p><p>
GCC always has had two different internal representations, trees and
RTL. RTL, the register transfer language, is the low-level
representation that GCC uses when generating machine code.
Traditionally, all optimizations were done in RTL. Trees are a higher-level
representation; traditionally, they were less documented and less
well known than RTL.
</p><p>
The tree-ssa Project, a long-term reworking of GCC internals
spearheaded by Diego Novillo, changes all that. Now, trees are much
better although still imperfectly documented, and many optimizations
are done at the tree level. A side effect of this work on trees was
the clear specification of a tree-based language called GENERIC. All GCC
front ends generate GENERIC, which is later lowered to another
tree-based representation called GIMPLE, and from there it goes to RTL.
</p><p>
What this means to you is that it is much, much simpler to write a new
front end for GCC. In fact, it now is feasible to write a front end for
GCC one without any knowledge of RTL whatsoever. This article provides a tour of how you
would go about connecting your own compiler front end to GCC. The
information in this article is specific to GCC 4.0, due to be released
in 2005.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fd4a8"></a>
Representing the Program</h2></div></div><p>
For our purposes, compilation is done in two phases, parsing and
semantic analysis and then code generation. GCC handles the second
phase for you, so the question is, what is the best way to implement
phase one?
</p><p>
Traditional GCC front ends, such as the C and C++ front ends, generate
trees during parsing. Front ends like these typically add their own
tree codes for language-specific constructs. Then, after semantic
analysis has completed, these trees are lowered to GENERIC by
replacing high-level, language-specific trees with lower-level
equivalents. One advantage of this approach is the language-specific
trees usually are nearly GENERIC already. The lowering phase often can
prevent too much garbage from generating.
</p><p>
The primary disadvantage of this approach is trees are typed dynamically.
In theory, this might not seem so bad&mdash;many dynamically
typed environments exist that can be used efficiently by
developers, including Lisp and Python. However,
these are complete environments, and GCC's heavily
macro-ized C code doesn't confer the same advantages.
</p><p>
My preferred approach to writing a front end is to have a strongly
typed, language-specific representation of the program, called an
abstract syntax tree (AST). This is the approach used by the Ada front
end and by gcjx, a rewrite of the front end for the
Java programming language.
</p><p>
For instance, gcjx is written in C++ and has a class hierarchy that
models the elements of the Java programming language. This code
actually is independent of GCC and can be used for other purposes. In
gcjx's case, the model can be lowered to GENERIC, but it also can be used
to generate bytecode or JNI header files. In addition, it could be used for
code introspection of various kinds; in practice, the front end
is a reusable library.
</p><p>
This approach provides all the usual advantages of a strongly typed
design, and in the GCC context, it results in a program that is easier
to understand and debug. The relative independence of the
resulting front end from the rest of GCC also is an advantage, because
GCC changes rapidly and this loose coupling minimizes your exposure.
</p><p>
Potential disadvantages of this approach are the possibilities that
your compiler might do more work than is strictly needed or use more
memory. In practice, this doesn't seem to be too important.
</p><p>
Before we talk about some details of interfacing your front end to
GCC, let's take a look at some of the documentation and source files
you need to know. Because it hasn't been a priority in
the GCC community to make it simpler to write front ends, some things
you need to know are documented only in the source. The documentation
references here refer to info pages and not URLs, because GCC 4.0 has
not yet been released. Thus, the Web pages reflect earlier versions. Your
best bet is to check out a copy of GCC from CVS and dig around in the source.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
gcc/c.opt: describes command-line options used by the C family of front
ends. More importantly, it describes the format of the .opt files.
You'll be writing one of these.
</p></li><li><p>
gcc info page, node Spec Files (source file gcc/doc/invoke.texi):
describes the spec minilanguage used by the GCC
driver. You'll write some specs to tell GCC how to invoke your
front end.
</p></li><li><p>
gccint info page, node Front End (source file
gcc/doc/sourcebuild.texi):
describes how to integrate your front end into the GCC build
process.
</p></li><li><p>
gccint info page, node Tree SSA (source file gcc/doc/tree-ssa.texi):
describes GENERIC.
</p></li><li><p>
gcc/tree.def, gcc/tree.h: some attributes of trees don't seem to be documented, and reading these files can help.
tree.def defines all the tree codes and is, in large part, explanatory comments. tree.h defines the tree node
structures, the many accessor macros and declares functions that
are useful in building trees of various types.
</p></li><li><p>
libcpp/include/line-map.h: line maps are used to represent source
code locations in GCC. You may or may not use these in your front
end&mdash;gcjx does not. Even if you do not use them, you need to build them when
lowering to GENERIC, as information in line maps is used when generating
debug information. </p></li><li><p>
gcc/errors.h, gcc/diagnostic.h: defines the interface to GCC's error formatting functions, which you may choose to use.
</p></li><li><p>
gcc/gdbinit.in: defines some GDB commands that are handy when
debugging GCC. For instance, the <tt  >pt</tt> command
prints a textual representation
of a tree. The file .gdbinit also is made in the GCC build
directory; if you debug there, the macros immediately are
available.
</p></li><li><p>
gcc/langhooks.h: lang hooks are a mechanism GCC uses to allow front ends to control some aspects of GCC's behavior. Each front end must define its own
copy of the langhooks structures; these structures consist largely
of function pointers. GCC's middle and back ends call these
functions to make language-specific decisions during compilation.
The langhooks structures do change from time to time, but due to the
way GCC expects front ends to initialize these structures, you largely
are insulated from these changes at the source level. Some
of these lang hooks are not optional, so your front end is going to
implement them. Others are ad hoc additions for particular
problems. For instance, the can_use_bit_fields_p hook was introduced
solely to work around an optimization problem with the current gcj
front end.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fdef8"></a>
Writing the Driver</h2></div></div><p>
Currently GCC requires your front end to be visible at build
time&mdash;there is no way to write a front end that is built separately and
linked against an installed GCC. For this step, read through the
appropriate section of the GCC manual to find out how to write the build
infrastructure needed for your front end. Ordinarily, the simplest way
is to copy another front end's files and modify them to suit.
</p><p>
Next, write two files to help integrate your front end into the GCC
driver program. The lang-specs.h file describes your front end to the GCC driver. It
tells the driver the file extensions that, when seen on the command
line, should cause GCC to invoke your front end. It also gives the
driver some instructions for what other programs must be run, such as
whether the assembler should be run after your front end and how to
pass or modify certain command-line options. It may take a while to
write this file, as specs are their own strange language. However,
examples in the other front ends can help.
</p><p>
The lang.opt file describes any command-line options specific to your
front end. This is a plain-text file written in a straightforward
format. Simple options, such as warning flags, can be put in lang.opt
and do not require any other code on your part. Other arguments have
to be handled by a lang hook you must write.
</p><p>
Next, implement the lang hooks needed to drive the compilation
process. The important ones in this category are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
init_options: the first call made to your front end, before any option
processing is done.
</p></li><li><p>
handle_option: called to handle a single command-line option.
</p></li><li><p>
post_options: called after all command-line processing has been done.
This lang hook also is a convenient place to determine the name of
the input file to parse.
</p></li><li><p>
init: called after post_options to initialize your front end.
</p></li><li><p>
finish: called after all compilation is done. You can use this to
clean up after your front end, if necessary.
</p></li><li><p>
parse_file: a lang hook that does all the parsing, semantic analysis and code
generation needed for the input file. It does all the actual work
of compilation.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fe580"></a>
Initialization</h2></div></div><p>
GCC needs your front end to do some initialization. Most of
GCC is self-initializing, but in order to accommodate the needs of
different front ends, it is possible to initialize some tree-related
global variables in atypical ways. I recommend not trying to delve
too deeply into this. It is simpler to define the standard tree nodes
in the standard ways and to think up your own names for trees
representing, say, the standard types in your language.
</p><p>
During initialization you want to call build_common_tree_nodes,
set_sizetype and build_common_tree_nodes_2. set_sizetype is used to
set the type of the internal equivalent of size_t; it is simplest to set
this always to long_unsigned_type_node.
</p><p>
Other setup steps can be done in this phase. For instance, in the
initialization code for gcjx, we build types representing various
structures that we need to describe Java classes and methods.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fe738"></a>
Compiling to GENERIC</h2></div></div><p>
Your parse_file lang hook calls your compiler to generate your
internal data structures. Assuming this completes without errors,
your front end now is ready to generate GENERIC trees from your
AST. In gcjx, this is done by walking the AST for a class using a special
visitor API. The GENERIC-specific implementation of this API
incrementally builds trees representing the code and then hands this
off to GCC.
</p><p>
All the details of generating trees are outside the scope of this
article. Below are examples, however, showing three major tree
types so you can see what each looks like.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fe898"></a>
Type</h2></div></div><p>
One kind of tree represents a type. Here is an example from gcjx of
the Java char type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tree type_jchar = make_node (CHAR_TYPE);
TYPE_PRECISION (type_jchar) = 16;
fixup_unsigned_type (type_jchar);
</pre>
</p><p>
You can represent any type using trees. In particular, there are tree
types representing records, unions, pointers and integers of various
sizes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fea50"></a>
Decl</h2></div></div><p>
Decl represents a declaration or, in other words, a name given to
some object. For instance, a local variable in the source code is
represented by a decl:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tree local = build_decl (VAR_DECL, get_identifier ("variable_name"),
			 type_jchar);
</pre>
</p><p>
There are decls representing various named objects in a program:
translation units, functions, fields, variables, parameters,
constants, labels and types. A type decl represents the declaration
of the type, as opposed to the type itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19fec08"></a>
Expr</h2></div></div><p>
Many kinds of expr trees are available that represent the various kinds
of expressions in a program. These are similar to C expressions
but are more general in some ways. For instance, trees do not distinguish
between if statements and conditional expressions&mdash;both are
represented by a COND_EXPR, with the only difference being that an
if statement has void type. Here's how we can build an
expression that adds our variable to itself:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tree addition = build2 (PLUS_EXPR, type_jchar, local, local);
</pre>
</p><p>
Trees that represent statements are linked together using a special
iterator API. Here is how we would chain together two statements,
s1 and s2:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tree result = alloc_stmt_list ();
tree_stmt_iterator out = tsi_start (result);

tsi_link_after (&amp;out, s1, TSI_CONTINUE_LINKING);
tsi_link_after (&amp;out, s2, TSI_CONTINUE_LINKING);

// Now `result' holds the list of statements.

</pre>
</p><p>
Other kinds of tree nodes exist; read tree.def and the manual for a
more complete understanding. It also is possible for a front end to
define its own tree codes; however, if you have your own AST, you
should not need to do this.
</p><p>
The overall structure of the program you generate probably is going to
resemble a translation unit decl, which would contain types,
variables and functions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19f5758"></a>
Handoff</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've built the trees representing a function, a global
variable or a type for which you want to generate debugging
information, you need to pass the tree to the appropriate function to
handle the rest of compilation. Three such functions are available at
present: rest_of_decl_compilation handles compilation for a decl node,
cgraph_finalize_function handles compilation for a function and
rest_of_type_compilation handles compilation for a type.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19f5860"></a>
Debugging</h2></div></div><p>
Although GCC has a fair number of internal consistency checks, it
still is too easy to provoke crashes in code that are unrelated to your front end.
In many cases, you can move up the stack, printing whatever trees are
being manipulated, until you find some discrepancy caused by incorrect
tree generation. This technique requires surprisingly little general
GCC knowledge in order to effectively debug your code.
</p><p>
GCC has some handy debug functionality. In the debugger you can call
the debug_tree function to print a tree. You also can use the
-fdump-tree family of command-line options to print trees after
various passes have been run.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19f59c0"></a>
Experience</h2></div></div><p>
My experience writing gcjx has been that lowering its strongly typed
intermediate representation to trees is quite simple. The tree back
end to gcjx, one back end among several, represents roughly 10%
of the total code of the compiler. Although unfinished, it currently
weighs in at 6,000 lines of code (raw <tt  >wc -l</tt>
count)&mdash;around the same
size as the bytecode back end. One inference to draw from this is
if you already have a compiler, the task of attaching it to GCC can be accomplished
easily.
</p><p>
As trees are high-level, I haven't looked at any RTL while writing
this front end. I haven't spent any time at all thinking about or
dealing with processor-specific issues. Unless your language has some
esoteric requirements, this ought to hold for you as well.
</p><p>
The statically typed AST in gcjx is easily reused. Currently, there
are four back ends, and I expect to write more later. For
instance, it would be simple to build a back end that writes a
cross-reference representation of the program to a database. Or, it
would be possible to write a back end that walks the AST searching
for typical errors, akin to the FindBugs program. This consideration
would be even more compelling for languages, which, unlike Java, don't
already have a wealth of analysis tools.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1905580.0x19f5bd0"></a>
Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>
The process of writing a front end certainly could be made even easier. For
instance, there is no need to require lang-specs.h. Instead, a front
end could install a description file that the GCC driver would read
at startup. Similarly, lang.opt probably could be dispensed with.
With more work, it even would be possible to compile front ends
separately from the rest of GCC.
