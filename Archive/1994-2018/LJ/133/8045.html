Professional performers need tools for
managing photos and creating attention-getting
promotional materials for print and on-line. Manage
the photo collection with gthumb, and lay out posters
with ease using Scribus.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2251580.0x2349558"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The San Francisco Bay Area is a hotbed of innovative
technological development and a crucible for the
growth of performance arts. One art that thrives in
the progressive creative environment of the region
is the belly dance. From elegant performers
draped in bead-encrusted costumes dancing in
upscale restaurants to the colorful, turban-bedecked
entertainers at Renaissance festivals and street
fairs, for more than 100 years belly dancers have
shimmied their way into every strata of contemporary
pop culture.
</p><p>
Middle Eastern dance arrived in the United States in the last quarter
of the 19th century, appearing in cultural exhibits at various World's
Fairs. Little Egypt was the first dancer to garner fame and prestige
while performing at the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago.
Her amazing performances were so popular that the entertainment
director of the fair, impresario Sol Bloom, hyped her in advertising
with his newly coined term, belly dance.
</p><p>
Although more formally known as Middle Eastern dance, the slang term
belly dance persists, encompassing a range of styles from traditional
ethnic forms, including the Egyptian Raks Sharki, Arabic for &ldquo;dance of
the east&rdquo;, to the highly stylized American Tribal Style and
experimental Raks Gothique techniques. Each method is defined by its
own unique blend of music, costume and movement vocabulary.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8045A.large.jpg"><img src="8045A.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The Gypsy look takes a number of forms
from traditional or historically flavored looks to more glamorous
costumes, such as Hannah's stylish beaded version. Gypsy dancers ring the
Mediterranean Sea and take many forms from the stylized Flamenco to
the flirty belly dances performed in Turkey and Egypt.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8045B.large.jpg"><img src="8045B.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Belly dance appears in a variety of venues.
Dancers assemble a wardrobe of costumes to suit different performance
needs. Simone wears her modern wild animal costume to performances
where she can demonstrate her wit and vivacious style.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8045C.large.jpg"><img src="8045C.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Belly dance is most often
seen in intimate venues. However, there are the occasional gala shows
where dancers pull out all the stops with high-style Egyptian costumes,
such as the one Setareh wore on a large stage at a formal dance concert.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8045D.large.jpg"><img src="8045D.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Tempest embodies the look and attitude of the new generation
of dancers who infuse traditional belly dance style with a modern
edge. Her signature style and Goth sensibilities are reflected in her
highly personal costume style, which easily could be worn in a variety
of venues from nightclubs to Renaissance fairs to belly dance
festivals.
</p></div></div><p>
From motion pictures to MTV videos, on television
sitcoms and even at local ethnic restaurants,
belly dancers are highly sought-after entertainers.
Therefore, working belly dancers require professional-grade IT
tools to meet their publicity needs with style and
panache. Audiences and potential clients have become
more sophisticated, demanding a higher degree of
polish and professionalism.
</p><p>
Gone are the days when a simple 8" x 10" black-and-white glossy photo
served as a dancer's complete marketing package. Teachers need a way
to get the word out about classes and performances. Professional
dancers have to advertise their skills, services and show times.
With the right tools, dancers can develop their own marketing
packages. Today's advertising needs include business cards,
flyers and Web sites.

Enter Free Software</h2></div></div><p>
Dancers now use computers for their own unique set of needs in
marketing, music and sometimes also video. Like emergent
innovation in dance in the Bay Area, GNU/Linux and other free software
truly invite exploration.
</p><p>
This article is based on our collaborations with several Bay
Area belly dancers and a digital photography workflow that is done entirely
with GNU/Linux software. We describe two example successes
using free software tools for belly dance marketing applications. In
addition, we explore some really interesting intersections of free
software and belly dance, both as an art and as a business. The
sense of community, as in GNU/Linux community, has apparent parallels
with the dance community. To contextualize this topic further, we
talked with several professional dancers to get their take on the
role of technology in their art and in their woman-owned businesses.
One example was Michell Joyce, who says, &ldquo;I really believe that my
Web site is responsible for my professional dance career.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Challenges also are present in dance business promotion, where content
also needs to educate. Amy Luna Manderino says of her dance group
Shuvani, &ldquo;Although our talents are diverse, they are all connected
through Shuvani, in which we perform Romani music and dance from
India, Turkey, Egypt and Spain. The biggest challenge is educating
the public about the Roma (Gypsy) Trail. Many people are unaware
that Gypsies are an ethnic community with a rich cultural
heritage....That's always the challenge when you produce something
in an artistic medium that hasn't been seen before, you have to
educate people on the concept.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2251580.0x234a160"></a>
Free Software in Belly Dance Promotion</h2></div></div><p>
We use free software for everything from professional photography
to document generation, as we discuss here. We have held several
belly dance photo shoots at the Creative Camera professional photo
studio in Santa Clara, California. This photography was conducted
with a digital workflow that uses 100% free software tools. For example,
we use The GIMP, gthumb and gtkam (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
Free software definitely addresses several concerns mentioned by belly
dancers. For example, in talking about Web content development for her
business, Tempest says &ldquo;Thumbnailing, sizing and finishing images is
very time consuming and can be especially tedious if the quality of
the images is less than ideal.&rdquo; Having spent a lot of time
recently batch-processing photos with gthumb, we find this gPhoto2 utility
indispensable for Web and print work.
</p><p>
Now we turn to some creative uses of free software in belly dance with
two key examples of creating belly dance concert posters. Each example
is a little different. In the first, we intentionally wanted to create
a new document from scratch for an upcoming event and needed
documents suitable for both print and electronic media. In the second
example, an event already was being promoted on the Web, but we needed a
print version right away, so some novel repurposing was done
with free software tools.
</p><p>
To create a new poster for a Spring-themed belly dance event, we held a
photo shoot and then edited the studio photos with gthumb and The
GIMP. These resulting images were combined with other text and photo elements to
create the poster. The poster itself was done on Linux using a desktop
publishing (DTP) application called Scribus. Refer to Clay Dowling's
article &ldquo;Linux as a Publishing Platform&rdquo; on the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site
for more details on using Scribus and The GIMP to publish on Linux.
Although we describe only some of the big steps we used with The
GIMP and Scribus, we were surprised at how easy it was to use this
powerful application to position graphic elements precisely
and ultimately obtain a professional result.
</p><p>
The first task was to select a suitable main photo of Michelle Paloma-Hudkins,
who was promoting a belly dance event held in Sunnyvale, California, in
March 2005. We start with gthumb, as shown in Figure 1. After looking
over several photos in the series that we did, we selected one. But rather
than insert a photo decorated only with a simple color border, it
seemed more Spring-like to use a fuzzy edge to the photo. This was
managed by using The GIMP's Script-Fu decor menu in Figure 2. The
output after edge manipulation is shown in Figure 3.

the chosen image.

Figure 3. The result nicely details a glamorous photo of Paloma, with the
fuzzy border effect.
</p></div></div><p>
To sell the idea of Spring, we wanted to composite into the poster a photo
of daffodils from a separate photo shoot. One photo was a field of flowers, over
which we intended to lay out announcement copy text. Another photo
was a bright closeup of a single daffodil.
</p><p>
The GIMP has powerful layer manipulation capabilities, and we
needed only a few of them to accomplish a lot. In Figure 4 we added a layer
filled with all-white color and merged this at 50% opacity to
create the slightly faded flower field image. The resulting picture is
shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8045f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Using layers in The GIMP, we added a white
layer to make the background photo appear faded.

Figure 5. The faded photo is now ready to use as
background art for a Spring-themed event.
</p></div></div><p>
To assemble all of the graphical elements, we started
Scribus. The easiest thing to do was to place the text onto the
letter-sized layout view in separate chunks, along with
graphical items. These could be changed and placed using Scribus
tools. An early version of the poster layout is shown in Figure 6. We
used the Scribus editing panel for changing the original ASCII text,
which imported with a default font, into something different and more
appropriately sized for the poster (Figure 7). Other text bodies
were handled similarly. This work included colorizing the text,
changing the line layout and other typographic
qualities.

chunks still are in the default font.

</p></div></div><p>
After text placement and coloring, we added two additional photos from live
belly dance events, with Simone and Tempest at the
bottom. The photograph of the single daffodil was placed in the
upper right, near the poster title. With the final edits complete, the bright and
engaging poster is shown in Figure 8. Using
Scribus, one source document could be used simultaneously for both
print applications and as an on-line PDF file for Internet distribution
to the public.

Figure 8. Final Result in Scribus: Dance into Spring
</p></div></div><p>
Our second example solved a problem in belly dance promotion where
pre-existing marketing content had to be used. With photos we'd taken
at an earlier photo shoot, Paloma created a Web poster for a
belly dance event held in December 2004, called Jingle Bell Raks. We now
needed to create a print poster plus a separate high-resolution
electronic distribution format. Free software made it possible to support
Paloma's marketing concerns where &ldquo;...obstacles include venues to
advertise at low cost. Finding the right bulletin boards to post on to be
most effective. Also finding new avenues of distribution to reach outside
the Belly Dance Community, to draw in the general public.&rdquo;
</p><p>
A high-quality print-oriented conversion program called HTMLDOC
(see Resources) came to the rescue here in an unusual application of
free software. The robust HTMLDOC program can be compiled from
source with ease. What is does is amazing: it reads in
HTML, images and other data and then automatically turns
that content into PDF files or PostScript as output. It also has
powerful book-production and indexing features. Our case was pretty
simple, we wanted to create a one-page print poster
and PDF file automatically. It was really easy to do, as shown in Figure
9. We simply
inserted the name of a single HTML file via the HTMLDOC GUI
and then configured the program to make PDF files. The resulting poster
as shown with xpdf is depicted in Figure 10.

Belly Dance and Free Software</h2></div></div><p>
We have only started an adventure in belly dance, using free software
primarily for photography and image-oriented marketing
projects. But more is clearly possible. Recalling Reuven M.
Lerner's <i  >Linux Journal</i> articles on Web syndication
and content management systems (CMS), it would appear that free software
exists to support solutions for Paloma and Tempest's comments about the
complexity involved in a belly dancer trying to create and expand her Web
presence. The free software tools for Linux and audio described in
Dave Phillips' informative articles offer exemplary tools for the job
of arranging belly dance music. The article by Olexiy Tykhomyrov and
Denys Tonkonog on the Kino movie-making application (see December 2004's
<i  >Linux Journal</i>) points toward free software for
editing digital video. Hence, it too is a potential tool for dancers
to have for live belly dance events.
</p><p>
And still more is possible. At the time of this writing, we are preparing
to do photography at a large annual belly dance event called
Rakkasah West, which &ldquo;is the largest Middle Eastern Folk Festival and
Fantasy Bazaar in the world&rdquo;. We expect to create 10,000&ndash;12,000
high-resolution digital photos covering this event over three days. We
plan to assemble photo collections automatically using GNU/Linux tools
such as gPhoto2 and the open-source language Python. These tools
certainly will be used for actual photo file management. However, we also
expect to use the Python scripting capability of Scribus to support
automatic generation of CD-ROM disk labels and nearly full custom-photo
books, indexed by belly dancer and/or troupe. Stay connected with
<i  >Linux Journal</i> for more details about this in the future.
</p><p>
Finally, Linux as a community-developed project has definite resonance
with the belly dance community. Linux is a gift culture, where
numerous programmers and maintainers contribute code for all to have.
Belly dancers communicate and network with one another
and with clients using the Internet, which is a large community
substantially woven together with an infrastructure of free software
and open standards. Advocacy for freedom and social consciousness
wring no less true in belly dance. As Luna explains, her troupe
Shuvani &ldquo;donates several performances a year to the Voice of Roma, an
advocacy group providing support for the Gypsies in war-torn
Kosovo. For example, through their program 'The Threads That Connect
Us' they provide material support for Romani women in the UN camps to
embroider products that are then sold here in the US.&rdquo;
