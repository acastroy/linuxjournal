This inexpensive processor offers support
for the Advanced Encryption Standard, so you can
do state-of-the-art encryption at wire speed.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Probably everyone who has used encryption
soon realised that the demand for processor power
grew instantly. On older systems, the trade-off for
using encrypted filesystems is slower file operations; on newer
systems, the trade-off is, at minimum, significantly higher
CPU loads. Encrypting network traffic with the IPsec protocol also slows
things down, and sometimes you may encounter performance problems even
on the standard 100Mbps network.
</p><p>
Options exist, however, for working around these encryption/performance
trade-offs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Don't encrypt: apparently the cheapest solution, but this can become very
expensive in the long run.
</p></li><li><p>
Accept the slowdown: the typical approach.
</p></li><li><p>
Use a standalone cryptography accelerator: a PCI card, for example,
doesn't help as much as you might expect, however, because the data
must traverse the PCI bus more often than necessary.
</p></li><li><p>
Use a CPU with VIA PadLock technology. What's VIA PadLock? Read on.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad9768"></a>
VIA PadLock</h2></div></div><p>
A while back, VIA introduced a simple but slightly controversial approach: select
some cryptographic algorithms and wire them directly in to the CPU. The
result was the introduction of an i686 class processor that understands
some new instructions dedicated to cryptographic functions. This
technology is called VIA PadLock, and the processor is fully compatible
with AMD Athlons and Intel Pentiums.
</p><p>
The PadLock features available on your machine's processor are
determined by its version. Processor versions usually are
written as a family-model-stepping (F/M/S)
triplet. Family is always 6 for i686 class CPUs.
If the model is 9, your CPU has a Nehemiah core; if the
model is 10, it has an Esther core. The stepping
denotes a revision of each model. You can
find your processor's version in /proc/cpuinfo.
</p><p>
Nehemiah stepping 3 and higher offers an electrical
noise-based random number generator (RNG) that produces
good random numbers for different purposes. The
instruction for accessing the RNG is called xstore.
As in Intel and AMD processors, the
random number generator in VIA
processors is supported by the hw_random
device driver.
</p><p>
Nehemiah stepping 8 and higher contains two
independent RNGs and the Advanced Cryptography
Engine (ACE). The ACE can encrypt and decrypt data
using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
algorithm with three standard key lengths&mdash;128,
192 and 256 bytes&mdash;in four different modes of operation:
electronic codebook (ECB), cipher block chaining
(CBC), cipher feedback (CFB) and output feedback
(OFB) modes (see the on-line Resources). The appropriate instructions
are called xcryptecb, xcryptcbc and so on. Later in this article, I
predominately use their common group name, xcrypt,
instead of the mode-specific instruction names.
</p><p>
Esther stepping 0 and higher inherited two RNG units
from Nehemiah. ACE was extended with counter (CTR)
mode support and MAC (Message Authentication Code)
computation. And there are two new acronyms, PHE and PMM.
PadLock Hash Engine (PHE) is used for computing
a cryptographic hash, also known as a digest, of
a given input block, using the SHA1 or SHA256
algorithm. The proposed instruction name is xsha.
</p><p>
The PadLock Montgomery Multiplier (PMM) is responsible
for speeding up one of the most time-consuming
computations used in asymmetric, or public-key, cryptography:
A<sup  >B</sup> mod M, where A, B
and M are huge numbers, usually 1,024 or 2,048 bits.
This instruction is called montmul.
</p><p>
As noted above, in the rest of this article I mostly speak about
the xcrypt instruction. Principles described further mostly are
valid for other units as well, and xcrypt serves only as an example.
Also, the terms and concepts covered in this encryption discussion
apply to decryption as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad9ad8"></a>
How to Use PadLock</h2></div></div><p>
In contrast to the external cryptography accelerators usually plugged in
to PCI slots, the PadLock engine is an integral part of the CPU. This
fact significantly simplifies its use, because it is not necessary to
bother with accessing the bus or with interrupts, asynchronous operations
and so on. Encrypting a block of memory with xcrypt
is as easy as
copying it over with the movs instruction.
</p><p>
At this point, encryption is almost an atomic operation. Before executing the
instruction, the buffer contains plain-text input data; a few clock
cycles later, when the execution finishes, we have ciphertext. If a task
requested processing of a single block, which is 16 bytes in the case of
the AES algorithm, the operation is fully atomic. That is, the CPU doesn't interrupt
it in the middle and doesn't do anything else until the encryption is finished.
</p><p>
But what if the buffer contains a gigabyte of plain text to be
processed? It isn't good to stop all other operations
and wait for the encryption to finish when it's this large. In such a
case, the CPU can interrupt the encryption after every single block of 16 bytes. The
current state is saved, and whatever else can be done is done&mdash;interrupts can be handled and processes switched. As soon as the
encrypting process is restarted, the instruction continues from the
point at which it was suspended. That's why I say this is almost an
atomic operation: for the calling process it looks atomic, but it can
be interrupted by a higher-priority event. The current processing state
then is saved into the memory and registers of the running process, which
enables multiple tasks to do encryption simultaneously, without the risk
of mixing their data. Again, it is an analogous situation to copying
memory blocks with the movs instruction.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad9c90"></a>
How Fast Is It?</h2></div></div><p>
According to VIA, the maximum throughput on 1.2GHz processors
exceeds 15Gb/s, which is almost 1.9GB/s. The benchmarks
I have run confirm that such a speed could be achieved
in real-world applications and not only in VIA marketing papers,
which definitely was a nice surprise.
</p><p>
The actual encryption speed depends on two factors,
cipher mode and data alignment. ECB is the fastest, while the most
widely used CBC mode runs at about half of the ECB speed.
PadLock requires the data to be aligned at 16-byte boundaries, so
unaligned data must be moved to proper addresses first, which takes some time.
In some cases, the Esther CPU can realign the data automatically, but
this still causes some slowdown.
</p><p>
Table 1 shows some numbers from my testing. The OpenSSL benchmark for VIA Nehemiah
1.2GHz produced the following results in kB/s.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad9e48"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. The Open SSL Benchmark for VIA Nehemiah 1.2GHz, in

The bigger the blocks are, the better the results are,
because the overhead of the OpenSSL library itself
is eliminated. Encryption of 8kB blocks in ECB
mode can run at about 1.7GB/s; in CBC mode, we get
about 800MB/s. In comparison to software encryption,
PadLock in ECB mode is 120 times faster on the same processor, and CBC mode
is 60 times faster.
</p><p>
Thanks to this speedup, the IPsec on 100Mbps network
runs at almost full speed somewhere around
11MB/s. Similar speedups can be seen on encrypted
filesystems. The Bonnie benchmark running on a Seagate Barracuda
in UDMA100 mode produced plain-text throughput at a rate of 61,543kB/s;
with PadLock, it was 49,961kB/s, and a pure software encryption ran at
only 10,005kB/s. In other words, PadLock was only about 20% slower, while
the pure software was almost 85% slower than the non-encrypted run.
See Resources for a link to my benchmark page with more details and
more numbers.

Linux Support</h2></div></div><p>
So far I have developed Linux support for the following packages only for
the AES
algorithm provided by the xcrypt instruction, because
I haven't used the Esther CPU yet. As soon as I get the new processor,
I will add support for the other algorithms where appropriate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad1650"></a>
Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
When the kernel needs the AES algorithm, it loads by default the aes.ko
module, which provides its software implementation. To use PadLock for
AES, you must load the padlock.ko module instead. You can do this either
by hand with modprobe or by adding a single line to /etc/modprobe.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias aes padlock
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, every time the kernel requires AES, it automatically loads
padlock.ko too.
</p><p>
Patches are available for kernel version 2.6.5 and
above; see the PadLock in Linux home page in Resources.
Also, the basic driver will be available in the vanilla 2.6.11
kernel without any patching.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad1860"></a>
OpenSSL</h2></div></div><p>
Those amongst us who are brave enough to use recent CVS versions of OpenSSL
already have PadLock support. Users of OpenSSL 0.9.7 have to
patch and rebuild the library, or they can use a Linux distribution that
has the patch already included in its packages, such as SuSE Linux 9.2.
</p><p>
To see if your OpenSSL build has PadLock support, run this simple command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl engine padlock
(padlock) VIA PadLock (RNG, ACE)
</pre>
</p><p>
If instead of (RNG, ACE) you see (no-RNG, no-ACE), it means that your
OpenSSL installation is PadLock-ready, but your processor is not. You
also could see an ugly error message saying that there is no such engine.
In that case, you should upgrade or patch your OpenSSL library.
</p><p>
For programs that use OpenSSL for their cryptography needs to
enjoy PadLock support, they must use the so-called EVP_interface and
initialize hardware accelerator support somewhere at the beginning
of their runs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;openssl/engine.h&gt;
int main ()
{
    [...]
    ENGINE_load_builtin_engines();
    ENGINE_register_all_complete();
    [...]
}

</pre>
</p><p>See the evp(3) man page from the OpenSSL documentation for details.
</p><p>
In SUSE Linux 9.2, for example, OpenSSH has a similar patch to let you
experience much faster scp transfers over the network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad1bd0"></a>
Binutils</h2></div></div><p>
To use PadLock in your own programs, you either can call the
instruction by name&mdash;for example, xcryptcbc&mdash;or write its hexadecimal
form directly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.byte 0xf3,0x0f,0xa7,0xd0
</pre>
</p><p>
For backward compatibility with older development tools, it is safer to
use the opcode form. Binutils versions 2.15 and newer, however, already
understand the symbolic names where appropriate, for example, in gas
(GNU assembler) or objdump programs. The binutils' BFD-library
responsible among other things for instruction-level operations also is used in the GNU
debugger gdb. A sample instruction dump of an encryption function may be
as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

(gdb) x/3i $pc
0x8048392 &lt;demo1+14&gt;:    lea    0x80495f0,%edx
0x8048398 &lt;demo1+20&gt;:    repz xcryptecb
0x804839c &lt;demo1+24&gt;:    push   %eax

</pre>
</p><p>
As you might have guessed, SUSE Linux 9.2 has PadLock patches in all the
appropriate packages, and you can enjoy PadLock support out of the box.
If your distribution does not have these patches, check out my Linux PadLock
home page in Resources for the available patches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad1e38"></a>
Programming PadLock</h2></div></div><p>
In the following sections, I describe some guidelines for programming
PadLock, including details of xcryptcbc. I also explain how to set up
PadLock for encrypting a buffer of data with the AES algorithm and
a key length of 128bits in CBC mode. All other instructions of the xcrypt
group are used in exactly the same way. Other PadLock functions apply
similar rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad1f40"></a>
xcryptcbc</h2></div></div><p>
xcryptcbc does not have any explicit operands. Instead, every
register has a given, fixed function:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ESI&mdash;source address.
</p></li><li><p>
EDI&mdash;destination address.
</p></li><li><p>
EAX&mdash;initialization vector address.
</p></li><li><p>
EBX&mdash;cipher key address.
</p></li><li><p>
ECX&mdash;number of blocks for processing.
</p></li><li><p>
EDX&mdash;control word address.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Unless written otherwise, all addresses must be aligned at 16-byte
boundaries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad2518"></a>
ESI/EDI&mdash;Addresses of the Source/Destination Data</h2></div></div><p>
Both source and destination addresses can be the same, so it is possible to encrypt
in place. The size of the destination buffer must be at least the size of the
source one. Both must be a multiple of the block size, 16 bytes.
Under some circumstances, the Esther CPU allows processing of
unaligned buffers, but the operation is slower.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad2620"></a>
EAX&mdash;Initialization Vector Address</h2></div></div><p>
The initialization vector (IV) is one of the parameters on which the
result of the encryption depends. The size of the IV is the same as
the block size, which is 16 bytes. Consult the literature for
details about initialization vectors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad2728"></a>
EBX&mdash;Cipher Key Address</h2></div></div><p>
Cipher keys can have one of the following sizes: 128, 192 or
256 bits. The AES algorithm internally uses a so-called expanded key,
which is derived from the given cipher key. For 128-bit keys, the
expanded key can be computed by PadLock. For longer keys, you must
compute it yourself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad2830"></a>
ECX&mdash;Number of Blocks to Process</h2></div></div><p>
The xcrypt instruction always is used with the rep prefix, which enables
its repetitive execution unless the ECX register is zero. The value in ECX
is decremented after each block is encrypted or decrypted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad2938"></a>
EDX&mdash;Control Word Address</h2></div></div><p>
To let PadLock know exactly how to process the data, we must fill a
structure called control word with following items:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Algorithm&mdash;you can choose only AES.
</p></li><li><p>
Key size&mdash;one of the supported sizes.
</p></li><li><p>
Enc/Dec&mdash;direction: encryption or decryption.
</p></li><li><p>
Keygen&mdash;did we prepare the expanded key or should PadLock compute
it itself?
</p></li><li><p>
Rounds&mdash;internal value of the algorithm; see the
explanation later in the text and in PadLock documentation.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In C we can use union to allocate the appropriate space for
the structure and a bit field to describe and access its items easily :

<pre     class="programlisting">
union cword {
    uint8_t cword[16];
    struct {
        int rounds:4;
        int algo:3;
        int keygen:1;
        int interm:1;
        int encdec:1;
        int ksize:2;
    } b;
};
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad2eb8"></a>
Assembler Example</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we know all the theory, it's time for a real example. To begin,
here are some lines of pure assembler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.comm   iv,16,16
.comm   key,16,16
.comm   data,16,16
.comm   cword,16,16

.text
cryptcbc:
    movl    $data, %esi  #; Source address
    movl    %esi, %edi   #; Destination
    movl    $iv, %eax    #; IV
    movl    $key, %ebx   #; Cipher key
    movl    $cword, %edx #; Control word
    movl    $1, %ecx     #; Block count
    rep xcryptcbc
    ret
</pre>
</p><p>
This piece of code encrypts one block of data with a cipher key
and an initialization vector, following the parameters set in
control word cword. Notice that we use the same address for both
source and destination data, therefore we encrypt in-place. Because
the field data has a size of only a single block, we set the ECX
register to one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29e1580.0x2ad3070"></a>
C Language Example</h2></div></div><p>
To use PadLock directly in a C program, we can write the
PadLock routines to separate assembler source file, then compile to
standalone modules and finally link to our binary. It often is easier,
though, to use the GCC inline assembler and write the instructions directly in the
C code. See Resources for a link to a tutorial on the inline assembler.

<pre     class="programlisting">
static inline void *
padlock_xcryptcbc(char *input, char *output,
    void *key, void *iv, void *control_word,
    int count)
{
    asm volatile ("xcryptcbc"
       : "+S"(input), "+D"(output), "+a"(iv)
       : "c"(count), "d"(control_word), "b"(key));
    return iv;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This code instructs the compiler to load the given values
of input, count and other parameters into the appropriate
registers. It then is told to issue the xcryptcbc instruction and,
finally, to return the value found in the EAX register as a pointer
to the new initialization vector.
</p><p>
To be successful here, we also must fill in the control word
structure correctly. First of all, it is a good idea to clear
the union to avoid using any irrelevant values that might be
in the memory:

<pre     class="programlisting">

memset(&amp;cword, 0, sizeof(cword));

</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's fill in the fields one by one. The first one in the list is
rounds. This item specifies how many times AES processing should
be run with the input block, each round using a unique part of the
expanded key. To comply with the FIPS AES standard,
use 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192 bits and 14 rounds
for 256 bits. Should the key_size variable contain the length of the
cipher key in bytes, this is how we get the rounds value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cword.b.rounds = 10 + (key_size - 16) / 4;
</pre>
</p><p>
The next field is algo. This is reserved to let you
choose future encryption algorithms instead of AES,
although AES is the only option at the moment. Therefore,
leave zero here.
</p><p>
The keygen field must be set to one if we prepare the expanded key
ourselves. Zero means that PadLock should generate it instead, but
that is possible only for 128-bit keys:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cword.b.keygen = (key_size &gt; 16);
</pre>
</p><p>
The item interm enables the storing of intermediate results after each
round of the algorithm is run. I suspect the CPU architects used this
field for debugging their core, and I don't see much sense in setting
this in the program.
</p><p>
Encryption is distinguished from decryption by the bit encdec. Zero is
encryption; one is decryption.
</p><p>
Finally, we must set the key size in the two bits of ksize:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cword.b.ksize = (key_size - 16) / 8;
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. With this prepared control word structure
and properly aligned buffers, we can call
padlock_xcryptcbc(). If the electrons are on our
side, in a short while we receive the encrypted data.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
PadLock documentation is available publicly on the VIA Web site; there you
can find further information about PadLock programming caveats. The complete
example program for encrypting one block of data, including verification
of the result, can be found on my PadLock in Linux home page. See Resources
