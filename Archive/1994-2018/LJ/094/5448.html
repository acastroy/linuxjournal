begins this two-part series with how to configure your
modem.</p><p>by Tony Mobily</p><p>Today, many people install Linux on their desktop computers.
Unfortunately, quite a few people seem to get stuck as soon as they
try to do the one thing that apparently no one is ready to give up:
connecting to the Internet. Why do they get stuck? There are
several reasons, but the main one is that there is no official
equivalent of Windows' &ldquo;remote access&rdquo; or Mac's ConfigPPP. As a
result, many users end up having some similar programs available on
their system (GNOME dial-up, Linuxconf, KDE dialer, etc.) without
knowing anything about them.</p><p>It is also quite possible that no automatic configuration
program is available (for example, if the user chose not to install
either GNOME nor KDE when he or she installed the system). So why
not take on the challenge of learning how to establish an internet
connection by hand? This article explains how to set up a modem on
your Linux system&mdash;a crucial step that many users seem to have
trouble with. In the next article I will talk about how to
configure pppd itself, assuming that the modem is configured
correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f2580.0x11ea8c8"></a>What You Need to Know</h2></div></div><p>To get the most out of this article you should first be
fairly familiar with the basics of using the shell (how to change
directory, list the files in a directory, etc.), editing a file
using any editor, running a program and using virtual consoles or
several terminals in the X Window System.</p><p>This article will assume that you have a real modem, not a
Winmodem. Configuring a Winmodem is possible but can be tedious and
is outside the scope of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f2580.0x11eaa28"></a>Finding the Modem</h2></div></div><p>The first thing you have to do is know where your modem is.
What we are looking for is the serial port to which the modem is
connected. This is true even if you are using an internal modem, as
the modem card itself will contain a serial port. Your computer is
likely to have two serial ports. Quite possibly, one is being used
by your mouse (unless you have a PS/2 or USB mouse). In UNIX, every
device is represented as a file in the directory /dev. This
directory contains an entry for every device you possibly could
have installed on your computer. The serial ports are called ttyS,
followed by a number between 0 and 3. Let's have a look:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd dev
ls -l ttyS*
crw-------  1 merc   tty    4,  64 Aug  3 10:24 ttyS0
crwxr-xr-x  1 root   tty    4,  65 Aug  3 10:25 ttyS1
crw-------  1 root   tty    4,  66 May  6  1998 ttyS2
crw-------  1 root   tty    4,  67 May  6  1998 ttyS3
</pre><p>Which is the one the modem is connected to? The answer is, it
depends on where you plugged in your modem (or, if you have an
internal modem, it depends on how it is configured). If you are
used to calling serial ports COM1, COM2 and so on, you should know
that the equivalents here are COM1 = ttyS0, COM2 = ttyS1, COM3 =
ttyS2 and COM4 = ttyS3. And, if you don't know which serial port
your modem is plugged into (or configured for) don't worry, because
we will find that out in a little while.
</p><p>Usually, there is a symbolic link (that is more or less the
equivalent of a Windows shortcut) called &ldquo;modem&rdquo; that points to
one of the serial ports. For example, on my system I have:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l modem
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root  5 Feb  7  2000 modem -&gt; ttyS1
</pre><p>In my case the modem is connected to the second serial port,
ttyS1 (the symbolic link you can see above basically means that any
program that uses the file /dev/modem is actually dealing with
/dev/ttyS1).
</p><p>Please remember that your system might be different, and you
might not have a symbolic link that points to ttyS1 or ttyS0. In
fact, the goal of this section is to have a symbolic link in /dev
called modem that points to the right serial port (that is, the one
your modem is connected to).</p><p>First we are going to determine to which serial port your
modem is connected. Type the command <b  >minicom</b>. To
see if minicom is already talking to your modem, just type
<b  >at</b> and press Enter. If you see an &ldquo;OK&rdquo;
response, minicom is using the right file in /dev to access the
modem. Otherwise, for some reason minicom was unable to talk to the
modem.</p><p>If there was no OK response from the modem, the first thing
to do is to find out where the modem is (that is, to which serial
port the modem is connected). This is done easily from minicom:
press Ctrl-A and then O. Please note that sometimes minicom is
configured so that it uses the Alt key. If that is the case, you
should remember that every time I write
Ctrl-<span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span>, you should press
Alt-<span   class="emphasis"><em>key</em></span> (e.g., instead of Ctrl-A and then O,
you should press Alt and then O).</p><p>The minicom configuration screen will pop up. Select &ldquo;Serial
port setup&rdquo; and press Enter. Now, press A and choose a different
serial port. For example if the current port is /dev/ttyS0, change
it into /dev/ttyS1 (Figure 1). You will now have to exit minicom
and run it again. Press Enter and select &ldquo;Save default as dfl&rdquo;.
Then select &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; (you will exit the configuration screen) and
quit minicom (Ctrl-A and then Q).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5448f1.large.jpg"><img src="5448f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. From this screen you can tell minicom which serial port
it should use to talk to the modem.
</p></div></div><p>Now, run it again. <span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span>
will talk to the serial port you chose. Type <b  >at</b>
and press Enter. If you receive an OK as a response, you have found
the modem (see Figure 2). Otherwise, you will have to repeat the
steps outlined in this section until you find the serial port (that
is, when you receive an OK response from the modem when you type
<b  >at</b> after running minicom). Please remember that
normal debugging procedures should be followed when you try to
figure out where your modem is. In particular, make sure your modem
is switched on, is connected to the computer, is using the right
power supply and that its connection with the computer is
firm.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5448f2.large.jpg"><img src="5448f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This is what minicom should look like when the modem
responds with OK.
</p></div></div><p>They seem to be trivial checks, but it is because of their
triviality that they are often ignored. As a result, you can spend
hours trying to configure a modem that actually is not connected or
switched on.</p><p>If there is an OK response from the modem, everything is
working, and it's only a matter of sorting a few things out. From
minicom, press Ctrl-A and then O. The minicom configuration screen
will pop up. Select &ldquo;Serial port setup&rdquo; and press Enter.</p><p>On the first line, you will be able to see what file minicom
is using to communicate to the modem. If it is /dev/modem,
everything is configured properly on your system, and you can skip
to the next section of this article (&ldquo;Talking to the
Modem&rdquo;).</p><p>If you received the OK response, but minicom is configured to
use a different port (such as /dev/ttyS0), then you have to create
a symbolic link called modem in /dev in order to make sure you have
a working /dev/modem entry in your system (remember, this was the
primary goal of this section). Write down which port minicom
actually is using (let's suppose it is /dev/ttyS0). Quit the
configuration screen (pressing Enter and selecting &ldquo;Exit&rdquo;), and
quit minicom (by pressing Ctrl-A and then Q). Now you are back to
your shell. Go into the /dev directory and create the symbolic link
for &ldquo;modem&rdquo; like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /dev
ln -sf ttyS0 modem
ls -l modem
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root  5 Aug  3 12:32 modem -&gt; ttyS0
</pre><p>Of course, you will have to substitute ttyS0 with the port
you found in the minicom configuration screen.
</p><p>Now, run minicom again. Make sure everything still works by
typing <b  >at</b> and pressing Enter. You should receive
the reassuring OK response (see Figure 2). Go to the minicom
configuration screen again (Ctrl-A and O) and select &ldquo;Serial port
setup&rdquo;. Now change the default device by pressing A and
substituting /dev/ttyS0 with /dev/modem (see Figure 1). Press
Enter, then &ldquo;Save setup as dfl&rdquo; and select &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; to exit the
configuration screen. In order to have minicom work with the new
configuration you have to exit minicom (Ctrl-A and Q) and run it
again.</p><p>Now minicom is using the device /dev/modem. Type
<b  >at</b>. You should receive an OK response (see
Figure 2). If that is the case, congratulations!</p><p>Configuring the modem is the most critical step when you try
to connect to the Internet. Many users do not know to which serial
port their modem is connected. As shown in the previous section, it
is clear that the modem was already configured; you only had to
find out where it was and create a symbolic link in /dev that
pointed to the right device file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f2580.0x11eb840"></a>Talking to the Modem</h2></div></div><p>It is interesting to notice that minicom itself doesn't have
any idea about the at command or the OK response. In fact,
minicom's main tasks are very simple: to display the characters
that come from the serial port and to send the characters the user
keys in through the keyboard to the serial port.</p><p>In a sense, the modem is like a robot that talks to the
computer using the serial port. That is why using minicom allows
you to, in a sense, have your own private conversation with the
modem. In the previous section, for example, you sent the modem the
string <b  >at</b>&lt;Enter&gt;, and the modem responded
with the string OK&lt;Enter&gt;.</p><p>What kind of conversation can you have with the modem? As a
matter of fact, every modem understands the Hayes command set that
is based on the at command set. Some manufacturers also offer some
very interesting extensions. If you want to find out what they are,
all you have to do is look up the commands available for your modem
in your modem manual. For example, the commands ATL-1, ATL-2 and
ATL-3 are common to every modem; they set the speaker volume to
low, medium or high.</p><p>Even though you don't need to know many of these commands to
use the modem effectively, you might want to try out a few commands
to understand a bit more about how your modem works. Remember that
it is always possible to type the commands
<b  >at&amp;f</b> and <b  >at&amp;w</b> to
reset the modem to the manufacturer's configuration in case you
send the modem a few unsafe commands that compromise its
configuration and prevent it from connecting.</p><p>The command <b  >ATDT93355100</b> is used to dial a
number, in this case 93355100. DT stands for dial tone, as opposed
to DP, which stands for dial pulse. You might have to use the
latter if you live in a rural area and are connected to an analog
telephone exchange. Try to send the modem the command
<b  >ATDT</b>, followed by the number of your internet
service provider, to see what happens.</p><p>In my case, the connection looks like the one in Figure 3. As
you can see, after the hardware handshake (with a lot of whistling
on both sides), the modem responds with a nice CONNECT 52500
message, which means the connection was established without any
trouble. Of course, there are other messages you may get as a
response: NO DIALTONE (there is no phone line attached to the
modem), BUSY (the line is engaged), NO ANSWER (there was no answer)
and so on (see Figure 4).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5448f3.large.jpg"><img src="5448f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. My screen after dialing two numbers. The first one was
engaged, and the other one didn't answer.
</p></div></div><p>In my case, the connection was established successfully and
my ISP sent me the cryptic string as soon as I connected (the one
that starts with ~}#.!}!&plusmn;} }4}``}&amp;} }*} } }%). In fact,
my ISP is expecting to have a conversation with my PPP d&aelig;mon,
whereas I am only running minicom, which will show exactly what my
ISP would have sent to my PPP d&aelig;mon.</p><p>It is very important to remember that from now on the modem
is going to stop responding to any at commands; all the information
sent to the serial port will be modulated and sent to the other
side of the line. At the same time, all the information coming from
the other side of the line will be demodulated and sent to the
serial port (hence, the word modem). The computer (or, better, the
serial port) is not aware of all this. It runs exactly as if there
was a serial cable running from your computer to the computer on
the other side. In fact, if you have two PCs at home, you can
network them together quite easily using pppd and connecting their
serial ports with a serial cable (you have to make sure it's an
inverted cable so that the send pin of the first computer is
connected to the receive pin of the second computer, and vice
versa).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f2580.0x15e4328"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Next month I'll talk about configuring your computer so that
