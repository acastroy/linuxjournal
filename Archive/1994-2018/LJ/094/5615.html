    How to determine what you can live with regarding
    patent-retaliation clauses.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf04580.0xffc660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month I wrote about different
categories of software patents and their effects on open-source and
free-software licenses. I left the final category, licensee
patents, for this follow-up article. This category is more subtle
than the previous two. Here, we are dealing with a licensee's own
patents or, perhaps even more important for derivative works, the
patents of downstream sublicensees of the open-source software.
Licensors sometimes include a patent-retaliation clause in their
licenses to help defend themselves against infringement claims. In
essence, a patent-retaliation clause says that if a licensee (or a
downstream sublicensee) sues the software licensor for patent
infringement, the license to the software terminates; a licensee or
sublicensee can't both use the software and also sue the licensor
for patent infringement.
</p><p>One open-source software licensor justified its use of a
patent-retaliation clause this way: &ldquo;Maintaining the defensive use
of patents will minimize unfairness.&rdquo;</p><p>There are two general forms of a patent-retaliation clause.
The first, a so-called weak patent-retaliation clause, says
something like this: if you take a license for my software, and you
later assert your patent against me relating to this software, then
your license for my software is terminated. The same
patent-retaliation clause usually applies to your sublicensees; if
one of your sublicensees sues your licensor for patent
infringement, your sublicensee's license to the software is
terminated.</p><p>I personally support weak patent-retaliation clauses in
licenses because I think they fairly balance the interests of the
licensor and licensee. Licensees and their sublicensees should not
be able to benefit from free and open-source software, while at the
same time forcing the licensor to pay royalties for patents
embodied in that very software.</p><p>A so-called strong patent-retaliation clause says something
like this: if you take a license for my software, and you later
assert your patent against me relating to anything at all, then
your license to my software is terminated. Again, this
patent-retaliation clause also usually applies to your
sublicensees.</p><p>I personally believe that strong patent-retaliation clauses
harm the Open Source community far more than they help licensors,
because companies with large patent portfolios will resist adopting
open-source software if the software licenses effectively allow
licensors to infringe the licensees' (or sublicensees') other
unrelated patents with impunity. Indeed, as a licensee of
open-source software, you may find that a strong patent-retaliation
clause inhibits your ability to disseminate derivative works. Your
downstream sublicensees may refuse to accept such a virus that
affects their ability to enforce their unrelated patents against
your licensor.</p><p>Apple is an example of a company that insists upon including
strong patent-retaliation clauses in its licenses. If a licensee
adopts certain Apple software, the licensee's use of that Apple
software is conditioned upon the licensee not suing Apple for
patent infringement in any other matter. So to the extent that
Apple's software becomes widely used, perhaps even indispensable,
in a licensee's company, Apple can now infringe any of that
licensee's other patents without fear of an infringement suit. A
company with a large patent portfolio might be reluctant to adopt
Apple software if it means, in effect, permitting Apple to use all
of its other patents. In fact, I probably would warn any client of
mine to consider avoiding Apple's open-source software for that
very reason.</p><p>I used the terms weak and strong to describe the two forms of
a patent-retaliation clause, but those terms may convey, in common
usage, the wrong idea. I don't mean weak in the sense of lacking
strength, energy or vigor. And I don't mean strong in the sense of
either physical power or economic or financial robustness. Rather,
what I intend to convey is the degree of pressure that can be
exerted by the licensor to defend his or her interests against a
licensee. A weak patent-retaliation clause only can be asserted in
limited circumstances for a relatively small set of patent
challenges. A strong patent-retaliation clause, on the other hand,
can pressure a licensee to refrain from a patent challenge even for
unrelated patents.</p><p>Whether you license your software to others or take licenses
to software for your own use, you should make sure that you can
live with any patent-retaliation clause you find in the license.
If, as a licensee, you don't have (or intend to have) any patents
that you can assert in retaliation, you may be able to live with
either of the patent-retaliation clauses. On the other hand, if you
intend to sublicense your derivative works, consider what form of
patent-retaliation clause your sublicensees can accept. And as a
licensor, consider how you later may be able to respond to a patent
threat. Consider including a patent-retaliation clause if you need
to use your software to help defend yourself against your
licensee's patents.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
