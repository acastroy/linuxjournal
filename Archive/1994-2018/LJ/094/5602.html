your body mass.</p><p>by David A. Bandel</p><p>Just thought I'd touch on a subject near and dear to my heart
this month: irresponsible ISPs&mdash;seems there's a number of them out
there. I see them every day in my server logs and e-mail. Not long
ago, with the court case in Australia, I found it necessary to
remove my RBL entry in sendmail&mdash;a mistake. I generally receive
around 200 e-mails per day. After removing the RBL entry, I
received so many spams it drowned my e-mail. I had a choice: delete
everything or waste all day deleting spam as I replied to the few
legitimate e-mails I received. So if any of you have e-mailed me
and not received a reply, try again. I'm methodically blocking the
IPs of every spam I receive. I've already blocked 90% of Korea and
Japan. I also have had to block what I understand is 80% of
Germany, but for another reason: massive attacks on my servers by
script kiddies and the intransigence of &lt;@url&gt;t-online.net
(&lt;@url&gt;t-online.de) to do anything about them. I'm getting
ready to do the same to
<a href="http://wanadoo.fr" target="_self">wanadoo.fr</a>. I almost blocked
<a href="http://sympatico.ca" target="_self">sympatico.ca</a>, but when I
told them I was about to block them, they took action. It shouldn't
have to be this way. If I had time, I'd put up an SQL server with a
list of IPs/IP blocks/domains that condone criminal behavior (spam
relays and attacks on servers). Both steal resources that I (and
you) pay for. Don't expect legislation to help until lawmakers
begin to depend on e-mail and are buried in spam. Until then, my
blocked list grows by the day. Too bad for legitimate users.</p><p>fwmon
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/firestorm-ids" target="_self">www.sourceforge.net/projects/firestorm-ids</a></p><p>For those of you firewall buffs out there, this utility
should interest you. The biggest problem with using it is that it
requires you to compile iptables with Rusty Russell's patch-o-matic
because according to the documentation, the iptables NETLINK target
is forever consigned to experimental status. You'll need the kernel
netlink device module also. After that, you can craft a
nonterminating rule for any filter table chain with the target -j
NETLINK. Then run <b  >fwmon</b>. Watching packets flow
on the screen is amazing. And because it writes to stdout, you can
pipe it to any program for almost any purpose. Requires: iptables
w/NETLINK, kernel compiled with NETLINK device, glibc.</p><p>ConnMon
<a href="http://www.student.lu.se/~nbi98oli" target="_self">www.student.lu.se/~nbi98oli</a></p><p>This utility will do connection monitoring similar to
netwatch. However, with a kernel patch, you can have statistical
tracking (bandwidth usage) monitoring with it. ConnMon uses the
adns package, which is an extremely fast set of asynchronous
resolver libraries and tools. Requires: libadns, libncurses,
glibc.</p><p>BMI
<a href="http://ibiblio.org/bmi" target="_self">ibiblio.org/bmi</a></p><p>If you want to know your body mass index, this little utility
will calculate it for you. If you're used to the US standards of
height and weight in feet and inches and pounds, you'll want to
make sure you have the units utility to convert. I'd note that this
is body mass (not body fat) because it doesn't take into account
muscle mass (which is denser) vs. fat. So you'll need a little more
information than simply the numbers presented, but if you know what
your target body mass index is, this can help you monitor your
results. Requires: libstdc++, libm, glibc.</p><p>Rotix
<a href="http://elektron.its.tudelft.nl/~hemmin98/rotix.html" target="_self">elektron.its.tudelft.nl/~hemmin98/rotix.html</a></p><p>For those of you who remember (and perhaps even used) ROT-13,
and noticed that it's missing from most, if not all modern distros,
Rotix will make a nice replacement. By default, Rotix performs
rot-13 rotation but can be told to perform other rotations as well.
Based on some of the mailing-list postings I've seen, Rotix would
be a good addition to the repertoire of a number of posters.
Requires: glibc.</p><p>Noguska On-Line Accounting System
<a href="http://nola.noguska.com" target="_self">nola.noguska.com</a></p><p>If you're a medium-sized business with complex accounting
needs, this may be something for you. Small businesses and SOHOs
may do better with SQL-Ledger, but NOLA provides a number of
advantages. NOLA offers everything from point of sale, to inventory
and more. Presently, it is available only in English and
Portuguese, but expect that to expand soon. My only note about this
is when you're ready to try to install it, all the documentation is
written in MS Word&mdash;not exactly an application available on Linux
servers for reading installation documents. Requires: web server
with PHP and MySQL, MySQL server, JavaScript-capable web
browser.</p><p>Calcoo
<a href="http://calcoo.sourceforge.net" target="_self">calcoo.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>Calcoo is a very easy-to-read and use scientific calculator.
You also can choose between standard and RPN (reverse polish
notation) for doing the calculations. About the only thing this
calculator lacks is the ability to switch from decimal to hex to
octal to binary. Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib,
libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, glibc.</p><p>Ministry of Truth
<a href="http://mot.sourceforge.net" target="_self">mot.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>I looked at several apps from three years ago, and while some
of you may have liked GABY or Gentoo better, this is my pick. I
can't say that it's changed a lot, but then, I didn't see a need
for it to change. I continue to use this little jewel. What more
needs be said? Track hardware, software, users and jobs. While it
appears to be in maintainer mode, it works and works well.
Requires: Apache, PHP, MySQL. Until next month.</p></div></div>
