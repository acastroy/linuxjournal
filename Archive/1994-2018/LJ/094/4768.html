    This open-source project aims to produce a compelling
    replacement for the Concurrent Versions System (CVS).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc3500"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you work on any kind of open-source
project, you've probably worked with CVS. You probably remember the
first time you learned to do an anonymous checkout of a source tree
over the Net, your first commit or learning how to look at CVS
diffs. And then the fateful day came: you asked your friend how to
rename a file. &ldquo;You can't&rdquo;, was the reply.
</p><p>&ldquo;What? What do you mean?&rdquo; you asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you can delete the file from the repository and then
re-add it under a new name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but then nobody would know it had been
renamed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let's call the CVS administrator. She can hand-edit the
repository's RCS files for us and possibly make things
work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And by the way, don't try to delete a directory
either.&rdquo;</p><p>You rolled your eyes and groaned. How could such simple tasks
be so difficult?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc3870"></a>The Legacy of CVS</h2></div></div><p>No doubt about it, CVS has evolved into the standard software
configuration management (SCM) system of the Open Source community,
and rightly so. CVS is free software and has a wonderful nonlocking
development model that allows hundreds of far-flung programmers to
collaborate. In fact, one might argue that, without CVS, it's
doubtful whether sites like Freshmeat or SourceForge ever would
have flourished as they do now. CVS and its semi-chaotic
development model have become an essential part of Open Source
culture.</p><p>So what's wrong with CVS? Because it uses the RCS storage
system under the hood, CVS can only track file contents, not tree
structures. As a result, the user has no way to copy, move or
rename items without losing history. Tree rearrangements are always
ugly server-side tweaks.</p><p>The RCS back end cannot store binary files efficiently, and
branching and tagging operations can become very slow. CVS also
uses the network inefficiently; many users are annoyed by long
waits, because file differences are sent in only one direction
(from server to client, but not from client to server), and binary
files are always transmitted in their entirety.</p><p>From a developer's standpoint, the CVS codebase is the result
of layers upon layers of historical &ldquo;hacks&rdquo;. (Remember that CVS
began life as a collection of shell scripts to drive RCS.) This
makes the code difficult to understand, maintain or extend. For
example, CVS's networking ability was essentially stapled on. It
was never designed to be a native client/server system.</p><p>Rectifying CVS's problems is a huge task, and we've only
listed a few of the many common complaints here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc3ad8"></a>Enter Subversion</h2></div></div><p>In 1995, Karl Fogel and Jim Blandy founded Cyclic Software, a
company for commercially supporting and improving CVS. Cyclic made
the first public release of a network-enabled CVS (contributed by
Cygnus software). In 1999, Karl Fogel published a book about CVS
and the open-source development model it enables
(<a href="http://cvsbook.red-bean.com" target="_self">cvsbook.red-bean.com</a>).
Karl and Jim had long talked about writing a replacement for CVS;
Jim even had drafted a new, theoretical repository design. Finally,
in February 2000, Brian Behlendorf of Collabnet
(<a href="http://www.collab.net" target="_self">www.collab.net</a>) offered
Karl a full-time job to write a CVS replacement. Karl gathered a
team and work began in May.</p><p>The team settled on a few simple goals: it was decided that
Subversion would be designed as a functional replacement for CVS.
It would do everything that CVS does, preserving the same
development model while fixing the flaws in CVS's (lack of) design.
Existing CVS users would be the target audience; any CVS user
should be able to start using Subversion with little effort. Any
other bonus features were decided to be of secondary importance (at
least before a 1.0 release).</p><p>At the time of this writing, the original team has been
coding for a little over a year, and we have a number of excellent
volunteer contributors. (Subversion, like CVS, is an open-source
project.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc3d40"></a>Subversion's Features</h2></div></div><p>Here's a quick rundown of some of the reasons you should be
excited about Subversion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Real copies and renames: the Subversion repository
doesn't use RCS files at all; instead, it implements a virtual
versioned filesystem that tracks tree structures over time
(described below). Files <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> directories are
versioned. At last there are real client-side mv and cp commands
that behave just as you think.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Atomic commits: a commit either goes into the
repository completely or not all.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Advanced network layer: the Subversion network
server is Apache, and client and server speak WebDAV(2) to each
other. (See the &ldquo;Subversion Design&rdquo; section below.)</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Faster network access: a binary diffing algorithm
is used to store and transmit deltas in <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span>
directions, regardless of whether a file is of text or binary
type.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Filesystem properties: each file or directory has
an invisible hash table attached. You can invent and store any
arbitrary key/value pairs you wish: owner, perms, icons, app-owner,
MIME type, personal notes, etc. This is a general-purpose feature
for users. Properties are versioned, just like file contents. And
some properties are auto-detected, like the MIME type of a file (no
more remembering to use the -kb switch).</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Extensible and hackable: Subversion has no
historical baggage; it was designed and implemented as a collection
of shared C libraries with well defined APIs. This makes Subversion
extremely maintainable and usable by other applications and
languages.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Easy migration: the Subversion command-line client
is very similar to CVS; the development model is the same, so CVS
users should have little trouble making the switch. Development of
a cvs2svn repository converter is in progress.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It's free: Subversion is released under an
Apache/BSD-style, open-source license.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc4738"></a>Subversion's Design</h2></div></div><p>Subversion has a modular design; it's implemented as a
collection of C libraries. Each layer has a well defined purpose
and interface. In general, code flow begins at the top of the
diagram and flows downward&mdash;each layer provides an interface to the
layer above it (see Figure 1). Let's take a short tour of these
layers, starting at the bottom.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4768f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Design Layers of
Subversion</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc4a50"></a>The Subversion Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>The Subversion Filesystem is not a kernel-level filesystem
that one would install in an operating system (like the Linux ext2
fs). Instead, it refers to the design of Subversion's repository.
The repository is built on top of a database, currently Berkeley
DB, and thus is a collection of .db files. However, a library
accesses these files and exports a C API that simulates a
filesystem, specifically a versioned filesystem.</p><p>This means that writing a program to access the repository is
like writing against other filesystem APIs: you can open files and
directories for reading and writing as usual. The main difference
is that this particular filesystem never loses data when written
to; old versions of files and directories always are saved as
historical artifacts.</p><p>Whereas CVS's back end (RCS) stores revision numbers on a
per-file basis, Subversion numbers entire trees. Each atomic commit
to the repository creates a completely new filesystem tree and is
individually labeled with a single, global revision number. Files
and directories that have changed are rewritten (and older versions
are backed up and stored as differences against the latest
version), while unchanged entries are pointed to via a
shared-storage mechanism. This is how the repository is able to
version tree structures, not just file contents.</p><p>Finally, it should be mentioned that using a database like
Berkeley DB immediately provides other nice features that
Subversion needs: data integrity, atomic writes, recoverability and
hot backups. See
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com" target="_self">www.sleepycat.com</a> for
more information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfc4cb8"></a>The Network Layer</h2></div></div><p>Subversion has the mark of Apache all over it. At its very
core, the client uses the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. In
fact, this means that a Subversion client should compile and run
anywhere Apache httpd does. Right now, this list includes all
flavors of UNIX, Win32, BeOS, OS/2, Mac OS X and possibly
NetWare.</p><p>However, Subversion depends on more than just APR; the
Subversion server is Apache httpd itself. Why was Apache chosen?
Ultimately, the decision was about not re-inventing the wheel.
Apache is a time-tested, open-source server process ready for
serious use, yet is still extensible. It can sustain a high-network
load. It runs on many platforms and can operate through firewalls.
It's able to use a number of different authentication protocols. It
can do network pipelining and caching. By using Apache as a server,
Subversion gets all these features for free. Why start from
scratch?</p><p>Subversion uses WebDAV as its network protocol. DAV
(distributed authoring and versioning) is a whole discussion in
itself (<a href="http://www.webdav.org" target="_self">www.webdav.org</a>),
but in short, it's an extension to HTTP that allows reads/writes
and versioning of files over the Web. The Subversion Project is
hoping to ride a slowly rising tide of support for this protocol;
all of the latest file browsers for Win32, Mac OS and GNOME speak
this protocol already. Interoperability will (hopefully) become
more and more of a bonus over time.</p><p>For users who simply wish to access Subversion repositories
on local disk, the client can do this too; no network is required.
The Repository Access (RA) layer is an abstract API implemented by
both the DAV and local-access RA libraries. This is a specific
benefit of writing a &ldquo;librarized&rdquo; revision control system; it's a
big win over CVS, which has two very different,
difficult-to-maintain code paths for local vs. network
repository-access. Feel like writing a new network protocol for
Subversion? Just write a new library that implements the RA
API.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfbb7b0"></a>The Client Libraries</h2></div></div><p>On the client side, the Subversion working copy library
maintains administrative information within special /SVN
subdirectories, similar in purpose to the /CVS administrative
directories found in CVS working copies.</p><p>A glance inside the typical /SVN directory turns up a bit
more than usual, however. The entries file contains XML that
describes the current state of the working copy directory (and that
basically serves the purposes of CVS's Entries, Root and Repository
files combined). But, other items present (and not found in /CVS)
include storage locations for the versioned properties (the
metadata mentioned in the &ldquo;Subversion Features&rdquo; section above)
and private caches of pristine versions of each file. This latter
feature provides the ability to report local modifications and do
reversions without network access. Authentication data also is
stored within /SVN, rather than in a single .cvspass-like
file.</p><p>The Subversion client library has the broadest
responsibility. Its job is to mingle the functionality of the
working-copy library with that of the repository-access library,
and then to provide a highest-level API to any application that
wishes to perform general revision control actions.</p><p>For example, the C routine svn_client_checkout() takes a URL
as an argument. It passes this URL to the repository-access library
and opens an authenticated session with a particular repository. It
then asks the repository for a certain tree and sends this tree
into the working-copy library, which then writes a full working
copy to disk (/SVN directories and all).</p><p>The client library is designed to be used by any application.
While the Subversion source code includes a standard command-line
client, it should be easy to write any number of GUI clients on top
of the client library. Hopefully, these GUIs should someday prove
to be much better than the current crop of CVS GUI applications,
which are no more than fragile wrappers around the CVS command-line
client.</p><p>In addition, proper SWIG bindings
(<a href="http://www.swig.org" target="_self">www.swig.org</a>) should make
the Subversion API available for any number of languages: Java,
Perl, Python, Guile and so on. In order to Subvert CVS, it helps to
be ubiquitous.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecb580.0xfbbac8"></a>Subversion's Future</h2></div></div><p>The release of Subversion 1.0 currently is planned for the
beginning of 2002. After the release of 1.0, Subversion is slated
for additions such as i18n support, intelligent merging, better
changeset manipulation, client-side plugins and improved features
for server administration. Also on the wish list is an eclectic
collection of ideas such as distributed, replicating
repositories.</p><p>A final thought from Subversion's FAQ: &ldquo;We aren't (yet)
attempting to break new ground in SCM systems, nor are we
attempting to imitate all the best features of every SCM system out
there. We're trying to replace CVS.&rdquo;</p><p>If in three years Subversion is widely presumed to be the
standard SCM system in the Open Source community, then the project
will have succeeded. But the future is still hazy. Ultimately,
Subversion will have to win this position on its own technical
merits. Patches are welcome.</p></div></div>
