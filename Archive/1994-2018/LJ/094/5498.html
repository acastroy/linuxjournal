of names) that you'll surely remember. In 1996 the company was
called Telenet Systems. It was renamed BSDi in 2000, and then in
April 2001, it became iXsystems, Inc. What happened to the Berkeley
Standard Distribution, you ask? Well, that's gone, sold to embedded
software giant Wind River Systems, Inc. Today, the company is
focused on building and selling custom low-profile, rackmounted
servers, available with your choice of Linux, Windows or BSD
(licensed back from Wind River). It's quite a change from the BSDi
we used to know.</p><p>The new hardware product line consists of a range of
Intel-based servers, ranging from an inexpensive 1U (that's one
rack unit or 1.75" &times; 19") model with a single Celeron
processor, to a 4U (7" high) system with four Intel processors. We
recently reviewed a late prototype of their mid-range system, the
iXtreme 1350, which is a 1U, dual-processor server optimized for
maximum rack density in a web hosting facility or corporate data
center, and given our initial skepticism about the
OS-vendor-turned-box-builder, we were impressed with what we
found.</p><p>The system we reviewed was equipped with dual 1GHz Pentium
III processors, 1GB of RAM and three Seagate Cheetah 9.1GB Ultra3
SCSI hot-swappable hard drives. This is a common hardware
configuration; all of the major server players, including Compaq,
Dell, HP and IBM, also manufacture dual-processor 1U servers with
essentially the same specifications; though Compaq ProLiant DL360
and IBM xSeries 330 models only have two internal hard drives
instead of three.</p><p>iXsystems equipped the server with the other hardware that
you'd expect in a product in this class: built-in CD-ROM and floppy
drives, serial and parallel ports, onboard video, two USB ports
(fairly worthless for a server, unless you want to hang a USB
printer off it) and dual 10/100 Ethernet connections. No surprises
there.</p><p>We were surprised, however, that iXsystems chose to give the
iXtreme 1350 only a single 64-bit PCI expansion slot. In the case
of our review system, that slot was already filled with an Adaptec
2100S SCSI RAID controller. That's a decent board, which has a
single Ultra3 SCSI channel&mdash;more than adequate for the three
onboard hard drives. The Adaptec board also has an external SCSI
connector, so you could hook it up to an external storage box to
bring the number of hard drives connected to the server up to a
maximum of 15.</p><p>Why is this a problem? In a rackmounted environment, many IT
professionals may choose to connect their high-density servers up
to a storage area network (SAN). Today, that requires the use of a
Fibre Channel network adaptor. Without an open PCI slot that's not
an option for the iXsystems 1350. Increasingly, many network
managers are also connecting their servers via Gigabit Ethernet,
rather than 10/100 Ethernet. Our lab also has a gigabit backbone,
and we usually put Asant&eacute; FriendlyNet GigaNIX or Intel
Pro/1000 network cards into new servers and hook them into a
gigabit copper switch. In fact, when both Fibre Channel SAN access
and Gigabit Ethernet networking are required, and there's only one
open slot, we use InterPhase's SlotOptimizer 5570, which has both
connections on a single PCI card.</p><p>Thus, with the iXtreme 1350, you can have SCSI, Fibre Channel
or Gigabit Ethernet&mdash;choose only one. Competing servers either have
two PCI slots, or have one PCI slot but place the SCSI controller
on the motherboard. (Note that iXsystems will sell you either the
RAID adaptor or gigabit adaptor, but doesn't offer a Fibre Channel
adaptor.)</p><p>One other complaint about the hardware: the box's cover and
PCI adaptor are held in place with tiny 3/8" long Philips-head
screws. The other server manufacturers have learned that in a
high-density, rackmounted environment, screws are bad news.
Depending on the angle you're working on, you can have trouble
getting them out, drop them when trying to put them back or even
have them fall inside a server. All of the major manufacturers use
catches, buttons or thumbscrews to hold down the cover, so you can
slide it off or swing it open without using any tools. They also
use catches or latches to hold the PCI cards in place, again making
it easier to swap them out while the server is still inside the
rack.</p><p>By using screws, iXsystems saved some dollars on their design
and manufacturing but have made the server more difficult to
service in the field. If you purchase this model, our advice is
that you remove the four screws holding down the cover before
installing the server inside the rack. Unfortunately, you can't
remove the screw holding the PCI slot together without making the
board wobble, so you'll just have to live with that.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20ff580.0x21f7a80"></a>The Software Side</h2></div></div><p>iXsystems offers this model server with your choice of
Windows 2000, FreeBSD 4.2 or Red Hat Linux 7.1 pre-installed. (The
company's spec sheet says that the server also can come with BSD/OS
and Solaris, but the on-line configurator didn't present them as
options.) Guess which one we chose?</p><p>Red Hat booted up just fine on the server and connected
instantly to our LAN. It had all the open-source applications and
goodies included with Red Hat's 7.1 Professional Server
distribution; yes, I know that 7.2 has been out for a while, but
7.1 is what iXsystems offers. The software appeared to be
competently installed, and it took little time to bring up Apache
and put a web site on-line. We only had the review server for two
weeks, but during that time, it ran the web site fine, handling
traffic (50 simulated users, sent over by Rational Software Corp.'s
SiteLoad software on another) without a hiccup or even a sneeze.
It's a Linux server. What more can you say?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20ff580.0x21f7be0"></a>A Good Value</h2></div></div><p>Out of the box, the iXtreme 1350 represents a good value and
has the secondary benefit of being from a company that truly
understands the Linux/UNIX universe. As equipped, the server
carried a list price of $3,319 US, according to the company. That
includes 90 days of e-mail/phone support for the operating system,
and three years of what the company calls standard hardware
support. That means, if the server breaks, you ship it to their
depot, and they'll fix it and send it back. Or, if you can identify
a broken part, they'll ship a replacement out to you.</p><p>The company really socks it to you, however, if you want more
OS support&mdash;increasing the OS support to three years costs another
$1,400. Their charges for on-site hardware support are more
reasonable and are worth getting if the server is critical to your
business: $450 US for three years of next-day or $770 US for three
years of same-day support. So, a system with no extra OS support,
but with next-day on-site support, would cost $3,769 US.</p><p>For comparison, we looked at two similar systems, each
dual-processor 1U servers with Linux, RAID controller and
three-year, next-day on-site support. The Dell PowerEdge 1550, with
the same hardware except for three 18GB drives (Dell no longer
sells 9GB drives), came through at $4,041 US. That's nearly a wash.
The Compaq ProLiant DL360, with dual 9GB drives, was an astounding
$7,461.</p><p>Based on hardware, software and pricing, we're impressed with
the iXtreme 1350; the company has done a nice job, and we'd have no
hesitation in deploying them or recommending them to clients, once
they take the cover screws out. Perhaps iXsystems will have trouble
living down their BSDi heritage and making the cultural transition
from being an operating-system brand to an off-the-shelf server
manufacturer, but in our opinion, they're off to a fine
start.</p><p><a href="5498s1.html" target="_self">Product Information/The Good/The
