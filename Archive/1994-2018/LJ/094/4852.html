    In Part I of this two-part series on the Linux Packet
    Filter, Gianluca describes a packet's journey through the
    kernel.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25f1558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Network geeks among you may remember my
article, &ldquo;Linux Socket Filter: Sniffing Bytes over the Network&rdquo;,
in the June 2001 issue of <i  >LJ</i>, regarding the
use of the packet filter built inside the Linux kernel. In that
article I provided an overview of the functionality of the packet
filter itself; this time, I delve into the depths of the kernel
mechanisms that allow the filter to work and share some insights on
Linux packet processing internals.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25f16b8"></a>Last Article's Points</h2></div></div><p>In the previous article, some arguments regarding kernel
packet processing were raised. It is worthwhile to recall briefly
the most important of them:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Packet reception is first dealt with at the network
card's driver level, more precisely in the interrupt service
routine. The service routine looks up the protocol type inside the
received frame and queues it appropriately for later
processing.</p></li><li><p>During reception and protocol processing, packets
might be discarded if the machine is congested. Furthermore, as
they travel upward toward user land, packets lose network
lower-level information.</p></li><li><p>At the socket level, just before reaching user
land, the kernel checks whether an open socket for the given packet
exists. If it does not, the packet is discarded.</p></li><li><p>Then the Linux kernel implements a generic-purpose
protocol, called PF_PACKET, which allows you to create a socket
that receives packets directly from the network card driver. Hence,
any other protocols' handling is skipped, and any packets can be
received.</p></li><li><p>An Ethernet card usually passes only the packets
destined to itself to the kernel, discarding all the others.
Nevertheless, it is possible to configure the card in such a way
that all the packets flowing through the network are captured,
independent of their MAC address (promiscuous mode).</p></li><li><p>Finally, you can attach a filter to a socket, so
that only packets matching your filter's rules are accepted and
passed to the socket. Combined with PF_PACKET sockets, this
mechanism allows you to sniff selected packets efficiently from
your LAN.</p></li></ul></div><p>Even though we built our sniffer using PF_PACKET sockets, the
Linux socket filter (LSF) is not limited to those. In fact, the
filter also can be used on plain TCP and UDP sockets to filter out
unwanted packets&mdash;of course, this use of the filter is much less
common.</p><p>In the following, I sometimes refer either to a socket or to
a sock structure. As far as this article is concerned, both forms
indicate the same object, and the latter corresponds to the
kernel's internal representation of the former. Actually, the
kernel holds both a socket structure and a sock structure, but the
difference between the two is not relevant here.</p><p>Another data structure that will recur quite often is the
sk_buff (short for socket buffer), which represents a packet inside
the kernel. The structure is arranged in such a way that addition
and removal of header and trailer information to the packet data
can be done in a relatively inexpensive way: no data actually needs
to be copied since everything is done by just shifting
pointers.</p><p>Before going on, it may be useful to clear up possible
ambiguities. Despite having a similar name, the Linux socket filter
has a completely different purpose with respect to the Netfilter
framework introduced into the kernel in early 2.3 versions. Even if
Netfilter allows you to bring packets up to user space and feed
them to your programs, the focus there is to handle network address
translation (NAT), packet mangling, connection tracking, packet
filtering for security purposes and so on. If you just need to
sniff packets and filter them according to certain rules, the most
straightforward tool is LSF.</p><p>Now we are going to follow the trip of a packet from its very
ingress into the computer to its delivery to user land at the
socket level. We first consider the general case of a plain (i.e.,
not PF_PACKET) socket. Our analysis at link layer level is based on
Ethernet, since this is the most widespread and representative LAN
technology. Cases of other link layer technologies do not present
significant differences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25f1df0"></a>Ethernet Card and Lower-Kernel Reception</h2></div></div><p>As we mentioned in the previous article, the Ethernet card is
hard-wired with a particular link layer (or MAC) address and is
always listening for packets on its interface. When it sees a
packet whose MAC address matches either its own address or the link
layer broadcast address (i.e., FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF for Ethernet) it
starts reading it into memory.</p><p>Upon completion of packet reception, the network card
generates an interrupt request. The interrupt service routine that
handles the request is the card driver itself, which runs with
interrupts disabled and typically performs the following
operations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Allocates a new sk_buff structure, defined in
include/linux/skbuff.h, which represents the kernel's view of a
packet.</p></li><li><p>Fetches packet data from the card buffer into the
freshly allocated sk_buff, possibly using DMA.</p></li><li><p>Invokes netif_rx(), the generic network reception
handler.</p></li><li><p>When netif_rx() returns, re-enables interrupts and
terminates the service routine.</p></li></ul></div><p>The netif_rx() function prepares the kernel for the next
reception step; it puts the sk_buff into the incoming packets queue
for the current CPU and marks the NET_RX softirq (softirq is
explained below) for execution via the __cpu_raise_softirq() call.
Two points are worth noticing at this stage. First, if the queue is
full the packet is discarded and lost forever. Second, we have one
queue for each CPU; together with the new deferred kernel
processing model (softirqs instead of bottom halves), this allows
for concurrent packet reception in SMP machines.</p><p>If you want to see a real-world Ethernet driver in action,
you can refer to the simple NE 2000 card PCI driver, located in
drivers/net/8390.c; the interrupt service routine called
ei_interrupt(), calls ei_receive(), which in turn, performs the
following procedure:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Allocates a new sk_buff structure via the
dev_alloc_skb() call.</p></li><li><p>Reads the packet from the card buffer
(ei_block_input() call) and sets skb-&gt;protocol
accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Calls netif_rx().</p></li><li><p>Repeats the procedure for a maximum of ten
consecutive packets.</p></li></ul></div><p>A slightly more complex example is provided by the 3COM
driver, located in 3c59x.c, which uses DMA to transfer the packet
from the card memory to the sk_buff.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25f2688"></a>Network Core Processing</h2></div></div><p>Let's take a closer look at the netif_rx() function. As
mentioned before, this function has the task of receiving a packet
from a network driver and queuing it for upper-layer processing. It
acts as a single gathering point for all the packets collected by
the different network card drivers, providing input to the upper
protocols' processing.</p><p>Since this function runs in interrupt context (that is, its
execution flow follows the interrupt service path) with other
interrupts disabled, it has to be quick and short. It cannot
perform lengthy checks or other complex tasks since the system is
potentially losing packets while netif_rx() runs. So, what this
function does is basically select the packet queue from an array
called softnet_data, whose index is based on the CPU currently
running. It then checks the status of the queue, identifying one of
five possible congestion levels: NET_RX_SUCCESS (no congestion),
NET_RX_CN_LOW, NET_RX_CN_MOD, NET_RX_CN_HIGH (low, moderate and
high congestion, respectively) or NET_RX_DROP (packet dropped due
to critical congestion).</p><p>Should the critical congestion level be reached, netif_rx()
engages a throttling policy that allows the queue to go back to a
noncongested status, avoiding service disruption due to kernel
overload. Among other benefits, this helps avert possible DOS
attacks.</p><p>Under normal conditions, the packet is finally queued
(__skb_queue_tail()), and __cpu_raise_softirq(cpuid,
NET_IF_SOFTIRQ) is called. The latter function has the effect of
scheduling a softirq for execution.</p><p>The netif_rx() function terminates, returning a value
indicating the current congestion level to the caller. At this
point, interrupt context processing is done, and the packet is
ready to be taken care of by upper-layer protocols. This processing
is deferred to a later time, when interrupts will have been
re-enabled and execution timing will not be as critical. The
deferred execution mechanism has changed radically from kernel
versions 2.2 (where it was based on bottom halves) to versions 2.4
(where it is based on softirqs).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25f28f0"></a>softirqs vs. Bottom Halves</h2></div></div><p>Explaining in detail about bottom halves (BHs) and their
evolution is out of the scope of this article. But, some points are
worth recalling briefly.</p><p>First off, their design was based on the principle that the
kernel should perform as few computations as possible while in
interrupt context. Thus, when long operations were to be done in
response to an interrupt, the corresponding driver would mark the
appropriate BH for execution, without actually doing anything
complex. Then, at a later time, the kernel would have checked the
BH mask to determine whether some BHs were marked for execution and
execute them before any application-level task.</p><p>BHs worked quite well, with one important drawback: due to
their structure, their execution was serialized strictly among
CPUs. That is, the same BH could not be executed by more than one
CPU at the same time. This obviously prevented any kind of kernel
parallelism on SMP machines and seriously affected performance.
<span   class="bold"><b>softirqs</b></span> represent the 2.4-age
evolution of BHs and, together with tasklets, belong to the family
of kernel software interrupts, pieces of code that can be executed
by the kernel when requested, without strict response-time
guarantees.</p><p>The major difference with respect to BHs is that the same
softirq may be run on more than one CPU at a time. Serialization,
if required, now must be obtained explicitly by using kernel
spinlocks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25f2b58"></a>softirq's Internals</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>softirq's</b></span> processing core is
performed in the do_softirq() routine, located in kernel/softirq.c.
This function checks a bit mask, and if the bit corresponding to a
given softirq is set, it calls the appropriate handling routine. In
the case of NET_RX_SOFTIRQ, the one we are interested in at this
time, the relevant function is net_rx_action(), located in
net/core/dev.c. The do_softirq() function may get called from three
distinct places inside the kernel: do_IRQ(), in kernel/irq.c, which
is the generic interrupt handler; system calls' exit point, in
kernel/entry.S; and schedule(), in kernel/sched.c, which is the
main process scheduling function.</p><p>In other words, execution of a softirq may happen either when
a hardware interrupt has been processed, when an application-level
process invokes a system call or when a new process is scheduled
for execution. This way, softirqs are drained frequently enough
that none of them will lie waiting for their turn for too
long.</p><p>The trigger mechanism also was exactly the same for the
old-style bottom halves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25e95f8"></a>The NET_RX softirq</h2></div></div><p>We've seen the packet come in through the network interface
and get queued for later processing. Then, we've considered how
this processing is resumed by a call to the net_rx_action()
function. It's now time to see what this function does. Basically,
its operation is pretty simple: it just dequeues the first packet
(sk_buff) from the current CPU's queue and runs through the two
lists of packet handlers, calling the relevant processing
functions.</p><p>Some more words are worth spending on those lists and how
they are built. The two lists are called ptype_all and ptype_base
and contain, respectively, protocol handlers for generic packets
and for specific packet types. Protocol handlers register
themselves, either at kernel startup time or when a particular
socket type is created, declaring which protocol type they can
handle; the involved function is dev_add_pack() in net/core/dev.c,
which adds a packet type structure (see include/linux/netdevice.h)
containing a pointer to the function that will be called when a
packet of that type is received. Upon registration, each handler's
structure is either put in the ptype_all list (for the ETH_P_ALL
type) or hashed into the ptype_base list (for other ETH_P_*
types).</p><p>So, what the NET_RX softirq does is call in sequence each
protocol handler function registered to handle the packet's
protocol type. Generic handlers (that is, ptype_all protocols) are
called first, regardless of the packet's protocol; specific
handlers follow. As we will see, the PF_PACKET protocol is
registered in one of the two lists, depending on the socket type
chosen by the application. On the other hand, the normal IP handler
is registered in the second list, hashed with the key
ETH_P_IP.</p><p>If the queue contains more than one packet, net_rx_action()
loops on the packets until either a maximum number of packets has
been processed (netdev_max_backlog) or too much time has been spent
here (the time limit is 1 jiffy, i.e., 10ms on most kernels). If
net_rx_action() breaks the loop leaving a non-empty queue, the
NET_RX_SOFTIRQ is enabled again to allow for the processing to be
resumed at a later time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25e9808"></a>The IP Packet Handler</h2></div></div><p>The IP protocol receive function, namely ip_rcv() (in
net/ipv4/ip_input.c), is pointed to by the packet type structure
registered within the kernel at startup time (ip_init(), in
net/ipv4/ip_output.c). Obviously, the registered protocol type for
IP is ETH_P_IP.</p><p>Thus, ip_rcv() gets called from within net_rx_action() during
the processing of a softirq, whenever a packet with type ETH_P_IP
is dequeued. This function performs all the initial checks on the
IP packet, which mainly involve verifying its integrity (IP
checksum, IP header fields and minimum significant packet length).
If the packet looks correct, ip_rcv_finish() is called. As a side
note, the call to this function passes through the Netfilter
prerouting control point, which is practically implemented with the
NF_HOOK macro.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ip_rcv_finish()</b></span>, still in
ip_input.c, mainly deals with the routing functionality of IP. It
checks whether the packet should be forwarded to another machine or
if it is destined to the local host. In the former case, routing is
performed, and the packet is sent out via the appropriate
interface; otherwise, local delivery is performed. All the magic is
realized by the ip_route_input() function, called at the very
beginning of ip_rcv_finish(), which determines the next processing
step by setting the appropriate function pointer in
skb-&gt;dst-&gt;input. In the case of locally bound packets, this
pointer is the address of the ip_local_deliver() function.
<span   class="bold"><b>ip_rcv_finish()</b></span> terminates with a
call to skb-&gt;dst-&gt;input().</p><p>At this point, packets definitely are traveling toward the
upper-layer protocols. Control is passed to ip_local_deliver();
this function just deals with IP fragments' reassembly (in case the
IP datagram is fragmented) and then goes over to the
ip_local_deliver_finish() function. Just before calling it, another
Netfilter hook (the ip-local-ip) is executed.</p><p>The latter is the last call involving IP-level processing;
ip_local_deliver_finish() carries out the tasks still pending to
complete the upper part of layer 3. IP header data is trimmed so
that the packet is ready to be transferred to the layer 4 protocol.
A check is done to assess whether the packet belongs to a raw IP
socket, in which case the corresponding handler (raw_v4_input()) is
called.</p><p>Raw IP is a protocol that allows applications to forge and
receive their own IP packets directly, without incurring actual
layer 4 processing. Its main use is for network tools that need to
send particular packets to perform their tasks. Well-known examples
of such tools are ping and traceroute, which use raw IP to build
packets with specific header values. Another possible application
of raw IP is, for example, realizing custom network protocols at
the user level (such as RSVP, the resource reservation protocol).
Raw IP may be considered a standard equivalent of the PF_PACKET
protocol family, just shifted up one open systems interconnection
(OSI) level.</p><p>Most commonly, though, packets will be headed toward a
further kernel protocol handler. In order to determine which one it
is, the Protocol field inside the IP header is examined. The method
used by the kernel at this point is very similar to the one adopted
by the net_rx_action() function; a hash is defined, called
inet_protos, which contains all the registered post-IP protocol
handlers. The hash key is, of course, derived from the IP header's
protocol field. The inet_protos hash is filled in at kernel startup
time by inet_init() (in net/ipv4/af_inet.c), which repeatedly calls
inet_add_protocol() to register TCP, UDP, ICMP and IGMP handlers
(the latter only if multicast is enabled). The complete protocol
table is defined in net/ipv4/protocol.c.</p><p>For each protocol, a handler function is defined:
tcp_v4_rcv(), udp_rcv(), icmp_rcv() and igmp_rcv() are the obvious
names corresponding to the above-mentioned protocols. One of these
functions is thus called to proceed with packet processing. The
function's return value is used to determine whether an ICMP
Destination Unreachable message has to be returned to the sender.
This is the case when the upper-level protocols do not recognize
the packet as belonging to an existing socket. As you will recall
from the previous article, one of the issues in sniffing network
data was to have a socket able to receive packets independent of
their port/address values. Here (and in the just-mentioned *_rcv()
functions) is the point where that limitation arises from.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24f9580.0x25e9c28"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>At this point, the packet is more than halfway through its
journey. Since space is limited in our beloved magazine, we will
leave the packet in the capable hands of upper-layer 3 protocols
until next month. What still remains to be explored is layer 4
processing (TCP and UDP), PF_PACKETs handling and, of course, the
socket filter hooks and implementation. Be patient!</p><p><a href="4852s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="4852s2.html" target="_self">Creation of PF_PACKET
