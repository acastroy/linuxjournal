Your Dream Machine&rdquo; (unabridged web version, available at
<a href="../091/5420.html" target="_self">/article/5420</a>),
you wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The SB Live! seemed to work with the stock
emu10k1.o sound module in Red Hat 7.1, but as it turns out it can't
run the earphone-out jack on the LiveDrive.</p></blockquote></div><p>Actually, it can&mdash;it just isn't set up to do so by default. I
own one of these cards, a good pair of headphones, and a cheap pair
of speakers, so I had reason to look into this. Here's how I got it
working. First, download the drivers from
<a href="http://opensource.creative.com" target="_self">opensource.creative.com</a>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -d ':pserver:cvsguest@opensource.
creative.com: /usr/local/cvsroot'
login [use the password 'cvsguest']
cvs -d ':pserver:cvsguest@opensource.
creative.com: /usr/local/cvsroot'
co emu10k1
</pre>


Everything there is under the GPL and changes here get folded into
the kernel tree, so there's no real point using this driver over
the kernel one. However, there are some utilities included that let
you (among other things) enable different inputs/outputs. So
compile and install their emu10k1.o if you want, but there's no
need. What we're after is <b  >make tools</b>. This gives
you all sorts of tools for doing fancy things with the card, most
of which I don't understand. The only one you need to get the
headphones working is emu-dspmgr, located in the utils/mixer
directory. With it, you can pipe your choice of inputs to your
choice of outputs, e.g.:
<pre     class="programlisting">
emu-dspmgr -a'Pcm L:Phones L'
emu-dspmgr -a'Pcm R:Phones R'
emu-dspmgr -a'CD-Spdif L:Phones L'
emu-dspmgr -a'CD-Spdif R:Phones R'

the attention they've deserved, I do find <i  >LJ</i>
to be a useful source. In your December 2001 issue, Mick Bauer
states that syslogd will create missing files. This certainly is
not true of my version of syslogd, though I admit I haven't
upgraded this box in quite some time. If the box isn't accessible,
security patches aren't as important. The docs of the current
version suggest that syslogd can create files, but my version also
makes that claim, and I've verified it won't. (Oh, and if it did,
it would be considered a security hole by some, myself
included.)</p><p>&mdash;Ed Grimm</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bauer replies:</b></span> As it
happens, I tested and verified syslogd's file-creation behavior
while working on the article; it works fine on both SuSE 7.1 and
Red Hat 7.0. Personally, I don't consider this a significant
security risk. At worst it's a denial-of-service exposure, but
that's why it's smart to give /var its own partition, i.e., in case
logs fill up the filesystem, whether by accident or attack.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100d580.0x11059d0"></a>Great Webmin Article</h2></div></div><p>I have been using Webmin for a couple years now to administer
my servers. It is a wonderful and powerful tool. I was very pleased
to read about it in your December 2001 issue. Mr. Elmendorf did an
great job. I hope to hear more on Webmin in the future in the pages
of <i  >LJ</i>--for example, how to add modules and
such. Great work!</p><p>&mdash;Jody &ldquo;JoLinux&rdquo; Harvey</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100d580.0x1105b88"></a>An Invalid Car?</h2></div></div><p>While reading the informative column (Geek Law,
<i  >LJ</i>, November 2001), I was amused to note the
example of LeCar as an invalid trademark for a car&mdash;you see I used
to drive a Renault LeCar from 1978-1983. I don't know if the name
was trademarked. I expect it wasn't strictly necessary in this
case, as who else would name a car LeCar except Renault?</p><p>I suppose this demonstrates the difference between branding
and trademarks. Whether trademarked or not, LeCar was a Renault
brand. There was no point in naming another car LeCar. On the other
hand, GTO was originally a Ferrari usage (I think) but was
appropriated by Pontiac later. By the way, GTO is an acronym (Gran
Turismo Omologato), which according to AltaVista means &ldquo;great
accredited tourism&rdquo;, which I suspect doesn't express the flavor of
the phrase.</p><p>In most countries the LeCar was known as the Renault 5; LeCar
was only used in the US as far as I know. A fun little car&mdash;I
regularly beat VW Rabbits off the line&mdash;a slow-motion drag
race.</p><p>It was the first new car I ever bought, just days after
getting hired at Tektronix, for my first career job. It survived
over 100,000 miles with only two major fixes (a blown head gasket
and a bad wheel bearing), which was something of an accomplishment
in those days.</p><p>&mdash;Gary Bickford</p></div></div>
