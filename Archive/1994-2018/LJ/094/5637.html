tips in the Best of Technical Support column. Sometimes I laugh at
basic problems, thinking &ldquo;this will never happen to me&rdquo;--until
now.</p><p>I am using Red Hat 5.0. A bad shell script accidentally
removed my /dev! I shut down my Linux system and rebooted before
restoring /dev from backup. So, I cannot restore the /dev from tape
using my rescue diskette, because /dev/st0 is gone. What are the
steps to recreate a basic /dev directory using my rescue diskette?
After that, how do I restore the /dev with tar?</p><p>&mdash;Rene,
<a href="mailto:rene.diependaele@ibbbs.be">rene.diependaele@ibbbs.be</a></p><p>Your rescue media also should have the default minimal set of
devices, and you could copy them to your now-empty /dev directory
with <b  >cp -av /dev/* /mnt/dev/</b> (if your disk is
mounted under /mnt). Then you can boot your system with
<b  >linux init=/bin/bash</b> at the LILO prompt, and you
will need very few devices.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,

settings for &ldquo;optimized defaults&rdquo;. I installed 1.5GB Nanya PC2100
memory and Red Hat 7.2. The system boots and runs but crashes
sporadically. No messages in syslog, just &ldquo;restart....&rdquo; When I
remove 512MB of the 1.5GB, the system runs fine.</p><p>I've tried dozens of combinations of distributions, kernels
and BIOS settings, as well as several disk configurations (hardware
RAID, software RAID, no RAID, disk on Promise controller only,
disks on Via controller only) to no avail. The distribution kernels
do not recognize the via8233 southbridge. I made appropriate
modification to via82cxxx.c and recompiled the kernels. The
southbridge is found, but the system still crashes.</p><p>I finally replaced the memory, but the problem persists. The
512MB DDR sits burning a hole in my desk. It was expensive
($199/stick). Of course, it's cheaper now, but I'd still like to
get this system running to its potential.</p><p>&mdash;Jim Peterman,

couple of years now and follow most of the technical things in
there. But now I have a technical question I can't solve concerning
the Teles PCMCIA/S0 card and kernel 2.4. I searched the Internet,
newsgroups, etc., for solutions but found none. What I did find in
the newsgroups are other people that have the same problem. Maybe
you can help us out here.</p><p>When I used kernel 2.2.x I always used the Teles PCMCIA/S0
card. No problem at all. When compiling a new kernel, I also needed
the extra PCMCIA card services and a patch downloaded from
<a href="http://home.wtal.de/petig/ISDN" target="_self">home.wtal.de/petig/ISDN</a>,
and everything worked fine. However, from kernel 2.4 this patch
cannot be used anymore&mdash;it just won't compile. In the documentation
of the kernel sources for 2.4, it says that they support the Teles
PCMCIA/S0 card. But, whatever I try I can't get it to work. It
always complains about not having the right I/O address, even when
I use the IRQ and I/O that I used with the 2.2.x kernel release.
The second thing is when inserting the card, I always get the
message that the kernel looks for module teles_cs.o. This was the
one from the
<a href="http://home.wtal.de/petig/ISDN" target="_self">home.wtal.de/petig/ISDN</a>
site.</p><p>Is there any way you can help me and all the people that want
to use this ISDN card? I'm now using the standard Red Hat 7.1
version with all the patches applied.</p><p>&mdash;Andre Seesink,
<a href="mailto:a.seesink@chello.nl">a.seesink@chello.nl</a></p><p>You might want to verify that the IRQ and I/O address you
specify are still valid. Sometimes when you boot other OSes, I/O
ports/IRQs on some Plug-and-Play devices are moved
automagically.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Wingert,
<a href="mailto:cwingert@qualcomm.com">cwingert@qualcomm.com</a></p><p>I haven't had much luck with the kernel PCMCIA support
myself. David Hinds (the pcmcia-cs author) recommended that I try
disabling PCMCIA in the kernel (you'll have to recompile your
kernel with PCMCIA disabled), and that I try using the standalone
pcmcia-cs package. My problems have gone away since I've done that.
Yours may too.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin,

primary partition is FAT16 (hdb1), and the secondary partition is
NTFS (hdb2). Linux is installed on a second hard drive, which is
connected as the secondary slave (hdd). While trying to mount the
NTFS partition, I keep getting the following error:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
The kernel does not support the ntfs fs.
</pre><p>The version of the kernel is 2.4.2-2. All my data resides on
the NTFS partition. I would like to use Linux as the primary OS,
without changing the partition structure.
</p><p>&mdash;Nigel Pereira,
<a href="mailto:pnigel1@hotmail.com">pnigel1@hotmail.com</a></p><p>In order to mount and access this partition, you'll have to
compile the ntfs support in your kernel, since it is not available
by default. The process of configuring and compiling the kernel is
documented in the Kernel HOWTO that usually can be found in your
distribution or at the linuxdoc site
(<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</a>).
Be careful though to keep the last working version so you can boot
back if something goes wrong. Your best solution would be to
migrate that partition to FAT32, but if you require NTFS, then you
will need to compile yourself a new kernel. Enable experimental
code to see the option for NTFS. Whatever you do, do not enable
write support. It is guaranteed to hose your partition.</p><p>&mdash;Ben Ford,
