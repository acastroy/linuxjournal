The content management behind <span   class="emphasis"><em>Salon</em></span> and other
popular sites is friendly to use for your Web
site's writers and editors.

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab7580.0x2baf348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Over the past few months, we have looked at a
number of different content management systems (CMSes)
based on Zope. Of course, Zope is not the only
game in town when it comes to open-source content
management systems. One increasingly more
prominent package is Bricolage, written and
maintained largely by David Wheeler and based on
mod_perl and PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
Bricolage is
designed to be used by nontechnical people. True, it takes a fair
amount of experience to modify and maintain Bricolage. But, whereas
the people who use Apache or Perl generally are programmers or system
administrators, the people who use Bricolage the most are the
writers, editors and producers of a Web site.
</p><p>
Bricolage also has managed to acquire a fair amount of real-world
experience. Apache and Perl needed to prove themselves for many years
before they were accepted as part of the mainstream; Bricolage has
been part of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Salon</em></span> magazine's CMS for a while, and
sites such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>eWeek</em></span>
and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Register</em></span> are in the process of moving over. Moreover,
professional publications not often known for their positive views of
open-source software recently have begun to evaluate and review
Bricolage. Most have found it to be an excellent
package, one that rivals proprietary software costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</p><p>
This month, we take an initial look at how to install and begin
using Bricolage. Over the next few months, we will look at it from a
number of perspectives, examining ways in which we can customize and
use Bricolage for different types of sites and publications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab7580.0x2baf660"></a>
Foundations</h2></div></div><p>
The core of every CMS is a database. Commercial CMS software
typically uses Oracle or Microsoft's SQL Server as the back-end
database server. Many open-source projects, including many of the
systems based on PHP, use MySQL. Bricolage, by contrast, uses
PostgreSQL for its back-end storage.
</p><p>
PostgreSQL often is known as &ldquo;the other&rdquo; open-source database, and
it has long supported the notion of a transaction, allowing
you to group several database queries or commands into a single
all-or-nothing group. PostgreSQL also supports other functionality
that serious database operators expect, including views, user-defined
functions, subselects, unions, foreign keys and integrity checks.
PostgreSQL also supports Unicode, which is increasingly important for
handling multilingual sites.
</p><p>
Bricolage uses PostgreSQL for its back-end storage, but the
application itself is written in Perl. There are at least two ways to
run server-side Perl programs for the Web: CGI, which is slow, safe
and portable, and mod_perl, which is fast, potentially unsafe,
and works only with Apache. Bricolage works under mod_perl,
meaning that its code&mdash;which is written as a set of Perl
modules&mdash;is
compiled once, cached in memory as Perl &ldquo;opcodes&rdquo; and executed
multiple times. As a result, Bricolage executes quickly.
</p><p>
As I mentioned above, mod_perl works only under Apache. Although
constant development work is being done on mod_perl for Apache
2.x, you should expect to run mod_perl for only Apache 1.x as of this
writing, in early June 2003. Because Apache 1.x runs as a set of
processes rather than multiple threads within a single process,
no way exists to do true database pooling among the various child HTTP
servers. However, keeping an established database
connection alive between Apache and PostgreSQL is possible using the Apache::DBI
module. Bricolage does exactly this, ensuring that database
connections do not need to be re-established each time a user makes a
request.
</p><p>
Finally, Bricolage presents its data to the end user with a set of
Perl/HTML templates. Many such templates are available for Perl
in general and for mod_perl in particular. I have been a longtime
fan of HTML::Mason.
</p><p>
As you can tell, one of the reasons I am so enthusiastic about
Bricolage is it combines some of my favorite
technologies&mdash;PostgreSQL, mod_perl, Apache and HTML::Mason&mdash;into a single
application that is good for end users.

Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing Bricolage is not a simple process. This situation is not the fault of the
Bricolage authors or maintainers but, rather, a result of
Bricolage using so many different modules from the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN). Currently,
installation still is not as smooth or easy as it could be, but things
have improved over time, with easier installation accompanying each version.
</p><p>
The easiest way to install Bricolage, after you have already installed
Perl, Apache and mod_perl&mdash;as a static module, not as an Apache
dynamic shared object (DSO)&mdash;is to use the pseudo-module Bundle::Bricolage defined in CPAN.
Normally, you can install a Perl module with the interactive CPAN
tool by first starting the CPAN shell with <tt  >perl -MCPAN -e
'shell'</tt>
and then typing <tt  >install Bundle::Bricolage</tt> at the prompt. If you
are running a relatively recent version of Perl, and if you have
defined the environment variables PGINCLUDE and PGLIB, all of the
modules should download, compile and install perfectly.
</p><p>
This is a long and involved process, however, and something is bound to go
wrong, if you're like me, with CPAN and double-checking that
you have installed everything you need by trying one last time to
install Bundle::Bricolage.
For example, I installed LWP and Bundle::CPAN using the interactive
CPAN shell. I then tried to install Bundle::Bricolage; the
installation (on a virtual colocation system running Red Hat Linux
7.3) failed for Cache::Cache the first time around but succeeded the
second time. CPAN dependencies sometimes can be tricky, and
not all modules clearly define and indicate theirs. It also failed on
DB_File (because the RPM for db3-devel was not installed),
causing problems with the installation of Apache::Session, which in
turn caused problems with HTML::Mason, on which Bricolage depends.
And, there were problems installing libapreq (because Apache was
already running on the same port number) and XML::Parser (because the
expat-devel RPM wasn't installed). Luckily, trying to install a CPAN
bundle indicates (at the end) which packages didn't
install cleanly. You always can try to re-install the bundle, in
which case the CPAN shell tells you which modules already are
installed and which still need to be installed.
</p><p>
Bundle::Bricolage does not install the Bricolage modules
but the modules on which Bricolage depends. So after you have
double-checked that Bundle::Bricolage is working correctly, download
the latest Bricolage tarball from the Bricolage home page
(<a href="http://www.bricolage.cc" target="_self">www.bricolage.cc</a>), open it up and type
<tt  >make</tt>. The Makefile
checks to make sure all required and some optional Perl
modules have been installed, and then asks if you want to install any
that are missing. It also checks that mod_perl was compiled
statically (and not as a DSO) and that PostgreSQL is installed.
Finally, it asks for a number of user names and passwords that
Bricolage needs in order to set up its databases and install its
HTML::Mason components on the system.
</p><p>
Once you answered all of the questions, you can start the installation
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make cpan &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab7580.0x2bafdf0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This command downloads and installs necessary modules from CPAN, tests
the Bricolage installation to ensure that it is working right and, if
all went well, installs Bricolage itself.
</p><p>
It's easy to run into some problems when installing Bricolage,
but overall the installation was impressively easy, given the complexity
of the system. The Makefile offered intelligent defaults, forced me
to provide a password to the &ldquo;bric&rdquo; PostgreSQL user and generally
ensured that things were running correctly and smoothly.
</p><p>
Once everything was installed, I invoked <tt  >bric_apachectl
start</tt> to
start Apache, pointed my Web browser at the root directory and was
greeted with a screen asking me to log in. The installation had
succeeded. As suggested by the Bricolage documentation, I immediately
changed the administrative password, which is appropriately set to
&ldquo;change me now!&rdquo; by default.
</p><p>
At this point I should mention that Bricolage uses a fair number of
pop-up windows. I personally happen to dislike pop-ups, even when
they are not used in the context of advertising. Although I
understand the nature of user interfaces in HTML often requires
pop-ups for the natural flow of information, I still wish
Bricolage used them a bit less. Moreover, a number of the internal
links depend on JavaScript, which means I cannot use my beloved
middle mouse button to open a new tab instead of a new window. But,
this and other minor blemishes do little to change the fact that
Bricolage is truly an amazing package.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab7580.0x2bb0108"></a>
Behind the Scenes</h2></div></div><p>
Bricolage consists of several parts: a data model in PostgreSQL, a
number of Perl modules and a number of front-end templates that
display information retrieved by the modules. In this way, it is
similar to other sophisticated database-backed systems. Indeed, although
Bricolage attempts to solve a more limited set of problems than
OpenACS does, and obviously uses different technologies to accomplish
its goals, the separation of data, libraries and templates is quite similar
to that system and to many other systems using a three-tier
architecture.
</p><p>
If you look in the inst directory of the Bricolage package, you
see the PostgreSQL database definitions used by the system. If you
are new to PostgreSQL, you might be a bit surprised by some of
the things you see there, such as sequences and constraints.
</p><p>
Sequences are a special kind of numeric object in PostgreSQL
whose values can never be reused. They are most often used to
ensure that IDs in the system are unique, especially when used
as primary keys. If you define a PostgreSQL column to be
SERIAL rather than INTEGER, you actually are creating a
sequence behind the scenes. Older versions of PostgreSQL
made it inconvenient to drop a table with a SERIAL column; you
had to drop the table and then drop the sequence associated
with the SERIAL column as well. As of PostgreSQL 7.3, however,
removing a table automatically removes any sequences that
were associated with its SERIAL columns.
</p><p>
Constraints allow the database to reject INSERT and UPDATE
statements that set values outside of a particular range. For
example, Bricolage defines a media table in which every
element has a priority between 1 and 5 but a default of
3. The column definition thus looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">
priority   NUMERIC(1,0)  NOT NULL
                         DEFAULT 3
                         CONSTRAINT ck_media__priority
                         CHECK (priority BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
</pre>
</p><p>
The constraint can be given an optional name, in this case
ck_media_priority. This
makes it easier to find and fix errors; if you try to insert an
invalid value into this column, PostgreSQL indicates the
name of the violated constraint. This helps quite a
bit when debugging problems with the database definition as well
as with the applications using the database.
</p><p>
Also a bit surprising is that a small number of functions are defined. PostgreSQL
makes it possible to define functions in a number of different
languages, including standard SQL and the procedural Pl/PGSQL,
as well as database-enhanced versions of Perl, Python and Tcl.
</p><p>
Of course, the core of the Bricolage data model is the tables.
A person table is used to describe system users, an org table
describes organizations and then a person_org table
handles the intersection between these two tables.
</p><p>
Indeed, it's possible to achieve a good understanding of what's
happening inside Bricolage without too much difficulty by
simply looking at the database definitions. For example, I added a new
story&mdash;a glowing review of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Core Perl</em></span>&mdash;to Bricolage using the default
administrative user account with all of the defaults. This inserted
a new record into the story table, assigning it a priority (as we saw
above), a date of publication and expiration, a version number (as
Bricolage also handles versioning of articles) and an indication
of whether the story has been published.
</p><p>


Several keys foreign to other tables demonstrate
how this particular article fits into the system. We can see it was created by the
administrative user, because the usr column points to the usr
table; it is part of the story workflow, distinct from other
workflows that have been defined, and referenced in a foreign key from
the workflow__id column; it came from the edit desk, distinct from
other desks, such as copy, legal and publishing, and referenced with
a foreign key to the desk table; and it is considered to be a book
review element, because its element__id column points to the
element table. Each of these other tables is
connected to still other tables that provide additional auxiliary
information, from burners to group IDs to formatting information.
</p><p>
In short, the story table sits close to the center of the
Bricolage data model&mdash;just as it should be given that a CMS is
centered around content, of which stories are the primary example.
Indeed, if you are new to the world of relational databases or
want to see an open-source project that uses them in a sophisticated
way, you would do well to look at Bricolage.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we took our first look at Bricolage, an open-source
content management system based on mod_perl and PostgreSQL. We learned
how to install and begin using it and then dove a bit into the
data model that Bricolage uses to keep track of the various story
elements.
</p><p>
Next month, we'll look at how to define elements, categories, media
types and burners, which will let us not only poke around with the
system but actually publish documents to our own private Web site.
Following that, we will dive a bit more deeply into the system,
examining the Mason templates that allow us to move away from the
default Bricolage look and feel, toward something closer
in spirit to the design we want for our own personal Web sites.

The Bricolage documentation is generally quite good, if technical. A
more user-level introduction to the system was published by O'Reilly
and Associates as an appendix to their recently published book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason</em></span> by Dave Rolsky
