If you typed &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; into Google News or any other
news aggregator site recently, you probably got
a bunch of links to the SCO vs. IBM lawsuit, the
information technology industry's most bizarre
legal battle. Because the case is moving way too
fast to keep up with in a monthly publication,
we're running our articles about the facts of the
case on our Web site.
</p><p>
We're not writing down merely the latest &ldquo;Fear
Uncertainty and Doubt&rdquo; (FUD) that SCO execs
Darl McBride and Chris Sontag are giving the
mainstream media. You know us better than that.
We've got articles that bring a little more insight
to the case.
</p><p>
In August 2002, our correspondent Jeff Gerhardt published the
first hint of SCO's search for money in the dusty
file cabinets of UNIX licenses, and he quoted McBride
as saying, &ldquo;obviously Linux owes its heritage to
UNIX, but not its code. We would not, nor will not,
make such a claim&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6293" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6293</a>).
</p><p>
A lot has changed since then, and Doc Searls
covered the initial complaint in March 2003, when
Sontag said, &ldquo;I have to say that this is not an
issue regarding the Linux community. This is an
issue between SCO and IBM.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Later, SCO pulled its own Linux distribution,
and Sontag claimed that there is &ldquo;significant
copyrighted and trade secret code within Linux&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Our May 15 story was the first public mention
of SCO's offer to let independent experts review
the allegedly copied code under a nondisclosure
agreement (NDA), available at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6877" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6877</a>.
</p><p>
Later, we published the full text of the NDA
and decided it was too legally risky to accept
it ourselves (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6923" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6923</a>).
</p><p>
But, Ian Lance Taylor, the mastermind behind Taylor
UUCP, came to the rescue, signed it and walked
into SCO's office. His essay on the journey revealed
tantalizing facts about an 80-line function that is in fact the same
in SCO UnixWare and Linux&mdash;but also found elsewhere (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6956" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6956</a>). He wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The similar portions of the code were some 80
lines or so. Looking around the Net, I found
close variants of the code, with the same comments
and variable names, in sources other than Linux
distributions. The code is not in a central part
of the Linux kernel. The code does not appear
to have been contributed to Linux by SCO or
Caldera. The code exists in current versions of
the Linux kernel.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
What's next? By the time this issue goes to press,
anything could happen, so watch our Web site for
the facts. After all, you can get FUD anywhere.
