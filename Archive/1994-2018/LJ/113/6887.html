If you're setting up a wireless gateway
for work or a public place, configure it to authenticate users
and prevent abuse.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d3580.0x15cb1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Wireless access in public areas is provided by 802.11 hot spots, with varying
types of access depending on the desires of the hot spot operator. Many
commercial hot spots exist in locations such as Starbucks or fast-food
franchises, whereas libraries and conference halls might choose to provide
free services to visitors and attendees. A public hot spot can be
entirely altruistic, offering visitors free network access in the area;
it can be a business opportunity, charging visitors for network access and
services; or it could be a combination, allowing visitors restricted access
and providing paying customers increased bandwidth or greater access.
</p><p>
Proprietary solutions are available for creating wireless
hot spots, but why go for a closed-source solution when your favorite
operating system and freely licensed tools can do it on a spare PC?
</p><p>
As the operator of a public access point, you have several options. The
easiest, of course, is simply to connect a wireless access point (AP) to
your network and allow all traffic. Unfortunately, the simplest route is not
necessarily the safest one from a security standpoint. If your hot spot is designed
to offer connectivity to the Internet at large or if it is connected to a
segment of your private network, you almost certainly don't want to allow
unfettered access to random passersby.
</p><p>
Many access points have controls to limit access by port and MAC address,
but they don't offer any other tools for managing new users, logins or providing
the user with information about the hot spot. The hot spots we discuss building
here provide a captive portal, a system where users who have not logged
in are forced to a single Web page with login, policy and, optionally, payment
information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d3580.0x15cb3f8"></a>
Hardware and Software</h2></div></div><p>
What do you need to get started providing a wireless hot spot? The list,
fortunately, is short:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Your favorite Linux distribution.
</p></li><li><p>
NoCatAuth hot spot/portal software (free, open-source and available
at <a href="http://www.nocat.net" target="_self">www.nocat.net</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
A wireless access point, or several. Access points function as a
bridge between the wired and wireless segments of your network.
What type of wireless you choose depends on the users of your network.
Currently, 802.11b is the most widely used; however, 802.11a offers
higher data rates over shorter distances. 802.11g hardware, which
provides higher data rates and is backward-compatible with 802.11b,
is becoming more prominent (see the Sidebar 802.11a, b or g?).
</p></li><li><p>
A moderately powered PC (Pentium or Pentium II class is more than
sufficient for routing packets). NoCat suggests having at least two
servers&mdash;one to act as a firewall and router and one to handle
authentication&mdash;but a single server will do in a pinch.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d3580.0x15cb870"></a>
NoCatAuth</h2></div></div><p>
NoCat builds a captive portal by assigning incoming users an IP address
using DHCP
and restricting network access until the user has validated, be it as a guest,
paying customer or administrator. By rewriting the destination of all port
80 traffic in the firewall, any Web page the user attempts to visit before
validating can be rerouted to the portal login page.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6887f1.large.jpg"><img src="6887f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The NoCat Portal Login Page
</p></div></div><p>
Not all access points have the ability to control what MAC addresses
are allowed on the network, and each manufacturer that does has a different
method of configuring it, so NoCat uses the standard Linux iptables firewalling to
control network access. It works with any access point. NoCat cannot
prevent users from associating with the wireless network nor would you want it
to; if a user can't associate, they can't log in. But it does prevent them
from gatewaying to the outside network. Because NoCat dynamically rewrites the
firewall rules to allow new users and deny disconnecting users access to the
wired network, it's best to use a dedicated system that doesn't have other
iptables rules on it already as a gateway.
</p><p>
NoCat consists of two main components: the gateway, which handles user
logins and routing packets from the wireless network to the real network,
and the authentication server, which stores user accounts and passwords.
Typically, one gateway server is used per access point, and a single
authentication server is used for a given installation.
</p><p>
The NoCat authentication system can use a simple
flat-file password system, a MySQL database, a
Radius or LDAP server or a Windows domain login
over Samba to validate a user. The authentication
server can be located on the local wired network or
elsewhere on the Internet.
</p><p>
You can run your own authentication server
on the same hardware
as your gateway. However, it's more secure and
easier for multiple gateways to use a single
authentication server if you use separate machines
for the authentication server and gateway.
</p><p>
Figure 2. Multiple NoCat gateways providing three
hot spots linked to the same wired network using a single authentication
server.
</p><p>
Before downloading and installing NoCat, you should begin planning what level
of access you want users to have and what your acceptable use policies will be.
Although the majority of your users likely will be honest, it's
possible someone may attempt to cause mischief. Your port restrictions and
acceptable use policies must strike a balance between being strict enough to
prevent abuse and being permissive enough that
the service is useful. Although any port can be used by a determined mischief
maker to cause problems, many hot spots choose to allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port
80) and HTTPS (port 443).
</p><p>
Other ports that may be useful to your users
include POP3 (110), IMAP (143) and SMTP (25), but these carry their own
risks to users and to your network. POP3 and IMAP traffic typically is not
encrypted, which means users checking their e-mail risk having
their passwords captured either in transit to their server or by someone sniffing
wireless traffic in the area. Allowing SMTP, especially to unauthenticated
users, can be dangerous because it
could help a spammer connect to your network. The chances of someone
sending massive bulk mailings through your hot spot probably are slim, but taking
precautions always makes sense.
</p><p>
Building NoCat itself is a simple process: simply download the NoCat
tarball from <a href="http://www.nocat.net" target="_self">www.nocat.net</a>, do <tt  >make gateway</tt> and
<tt  >make install</tt>
and edit the configuration file, /usr/local/nocat/nocat.conf. For full
functionality, install a DHCP server and configure
it to hand out private addresses for your wireless network.
</p><p>
NoCat is controlled by the nocat.conf file. A basic gateway needs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GatewayMode: controls the type of portal you run. An open portal
allows anyone to use it once the terms on the splash page are accepted. A
closed portal requires users to authenticate before they get access.
</p></li><li><p>
IncludePorts and ExcludePorts: these control what TCP ports users are
allowed to access. If you're running an open portal, you almost certainly
want to restrict these to prevent abuse of the network. IncludePorts allows
only the listed ports to be used, and ExcludePorts allows any ports but the
listed ports to be used.
</p></li><li><p>
InternalDevice and ExternalDevice: control the network interfaces
that NoCat uses. The InternalDevice specifies the device to which the access point
is connected, and the ExternalDevice specifies the wired network.
</p></li><li><p>
LocalNetwork and DNSAddr: LocalNetwork should be set to the network used on
your wireless network, and DNSAddr should be set only if you have a DNS server
outside your wireless network. If you have a DNS server on your wireless
segment, you won't need this option.
</p></li><li><p>
AuthserviceAddr, AuthServiceURL and LogoutURL: control the type of
authentication service the portal uses. By default, they are configured to
use the NoCat authentication servers. If you're running a closed portal,
though,
you'll almost certainly want to set these to be your own authentication system.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Your portal can work with only the minimal configuration, but
investigate the other configuration options to customize your
portal's interface and rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d3580.0x15cc478"></a>
Five Steps to a Simple Portal</h2></div></div><p>
Our example portal is a basic open portal. It needs only
a single access point and server, because we don't need our own
authentication system. We'll also lock it down so anonymous users can
browse Web pages, use AIM and SSH to remote systems, but they won't have
access to other TCP ports. This is a reasonably secure configuration
for anonymous users, but you may wish to restrict it even further and
allow only Web page access.
</p><p>
For our example portal, we use the following equipment:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A generic access point, such as the Linksys WAP11, D-Link DWL900, the SMC
2655W or countless others. Normally, access points function as bridges
connecting all users on a wired and wireless network, but in our setup we use
the NoCat gateway to restrict traffic.
</p></li><li><p>
A Linux server with at least 32MB of RAM, preferably a Pentium class
processor or better; your favorite Linux distribution with Perl, Apache-SSL,
iptables, Bind and DHCP; and two Ethernet cards. Alternatively, use one Ethernet card and one
network card of whatever type is needed to connect to your external
network. Once we have all the equipment, we can put the portal together in
five easy steps:
</p></li></ul></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Configure the Linux gateway to be on the real
network and the wireless networks and to connect to server DHCP and DNS addresses.
Plug the first Ethernet card (eth0) in to the access point and the
second Ethernet card (eth1) in to the real network. Each distribution
has its own method of configuring network cards, so here we use
the command line. You'll need to configure your system to set up these
interfaces at boot time. We're using 123.123.123.123 as an example
address; you should change this to whatever your real address is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 \
netmask 255.255.255.0 up
ifconfig eth1 123.123.123.123 \
netmask 255.255.255.0 up
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Configure BIND (the DNS server) to be a basic caching DNS server
listening to the local network. The default bind installation comes
with an example caching configuration.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure DHCP to hand out addresses in the
192.168.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> network by
putting the following in /etc/dhcpd.conf. If your DNS server is not
192.168.1.1, change the domain-name-servers option line accordingly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
max-lease-time 120;
default-lease-time 120;
allow unknown-clients;

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    option routers 192.168.1.1;
    option broadcast-address 192.168.1.255;
    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
    option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
    range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.254;
}
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Compile and install NoCat.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure NoCat:

<pre     class="programlisting">
InternalInterface	eth0
ExternalInterface	eth1
LocalNetwork		192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0
GatewayMode			open
IncludePorts		22 80 443 5190
</pre>
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d3580.0x15cccb8"></a>
Things to Remember</h2></div></div><p>
When setting up and operating a wireless hot spot, you should remember a
few things. First, protect your user information. If you allow users to sign up for your
service over the wireless, and especially if you plan to take
credit-card information, configure Apache for SSL encryption.
Second, encourage users to use encryption wherever possible.
POP and IMAP traffic can be encrypted with SSL if the remote
site supports it, and any traffic can be tunneled over SSH if
users have a remote account to which they can connect.
Finally, learn as much as possible about wireless technology and security, and
consider running monitoring programs. Many
wireless security programs are available, but staying on the free software
side of the fence, AirSnort (<a href="http://airsnort.shmoo.com" target="_self">airsnort.shmoo.com</a>), Kismet
(<a href="http://www.kismetwireless.net" target="_self">www.kismetwireless.net</a>) and Snort (<a href="http://www.snort.org" target="_self">www.snort.org</a>)
are good places to begin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d3580.0x15c3758"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
802.11a, b or g?</b></p><p>
802.11a is nowhere near as widespread as 802.11b,
and 802.11g boasts the same speeds plus backward
compatibility. 802.11a also is extremely short-range.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, existing 802.11g
hardware on the market was released before the IEEE
specification was completed and may not be compatible
with other or future 802.11g implementations.
Many reviewers have found backward-compatibility
problems. Future 802.11g implementations hopefully will
have these issues resolved. It may
be more cost effective to set up a hot spot using
802.11b now and upgrade in the future.
</p><p>
Sam Leffler recently has developed drivers for
Atheros 802.11a and 802.11g cards. However, the
drivers require a proprietary hardware abstraction
layer to restrict the frequencies and power
the card uses.
