<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #113, September 2003</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Kernel development seems to be inching toward
a <span   class="bold"><b>2.6</b></span> release. The October 31, 2002
feature-freeze has not held firm, and many new features
have been going into the kernel ever since. However,
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and others have been more strict
about how invasive any new features can be;
in early May 2003, Linus said he would begin
rejecting patches that were not completely obvious,
unless they went through a lot of other folks in
the chain of command. My guess is
the chance of seeing a 2.6 kernel before
the end of 2003 is slim, but we may see a <span   class="bold"><b>code
freeze</b></span> by
September or October 2003.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds has made this very clear: he will
accept patches supporting <span   class="bold"><b>Digital Rights
Management</b></span> (DRM).
DRM is
intended to deprive users of
control over how data on a system may be used. For
instance, with DRM, a digitized song might be
played only a certain number of times before
requiring the user to pay money to a vendor.
DRM is a generic term referring to any attempt
to exert this kind of control over how data
is used. It may be implemented in software or
hardware. In the free software and open-source world, DRM
is regarded as a terrible threat, possibly to the
very existence of free and open software. Linus
feels the fundamental kernel features involved
in DRM are not bad in themselves, but represent
generic security measures that could be used
for DRM or for something else. Some patches already have
been proposed, and by adopting them or
others into the kernel, Linus may be creating a
foothold to prevent the eventual criminalization
of free software.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>HFS+</b></span> filesystem, the default on Mac OS
X systems, has been given a fresh infusion of life
by <span   class="bold"><b>Roman Zippel</b></span>. On behalf of Ardis Technologies,
he took the existing HFS+ driver by <span   class="bold"><b>Brad
Boyer</b></span>
and made a big batch of improvements, including
full read and write support, better performance
and support for hard links. This is a real benefit
for iPod and other Mac users, but unfortunately,
as is so often the case, Roman forgot to tell
Brad what he was doing, so there was a bit
of a skirmish over maintainership when Roman
announced the new code. As of this writing,
it remains unclear as to whether Roman or
Brad will lead the project or whether something
else will happen.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>National Security Agency</b></span> (NSA) has made
some API changes to their <span   class="bold"><b>SE Linux</b></span> distribution
as part of a push to get SE Linux patches into
the main 2.5 tree in time for 2.6. Their changes
include support for extended attributes on the
ext3 filesystem. This would allow virtually any
kind of additional file metadata to be stored with
a file. <span   class="bold"><b>Extended Attributes</b></span> (EAs) can be used to
implement security features such as <span   class="bold"><b>Access Control
Lists</b></span> (ACLs) and filesystem capabilities. The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Security Module</b></span> (LSM), at the back end of
SE Linux, also received some attention from the
NSA. They modified some of the module's hooks
in order to prevent security exploits during the
fraction of a second between when a file security
label is changed and the corresponding inode
security field is updated to reflect that fact.
</p><p>
It seems that some <span   class="bold"><b>Wireless LAN</b></span> chips
(Broadcom's BCM4306 and BCM2050, to name two)
are capable of receiving military communications
and transmitting at those same frequencies. This
is slowing down the creation of free drivers for
these chips, because the hardware manufacturers can
release the chip specifications only at the risk
of angering various government agencies around the
world. As one might expect, once the &ldquo;features&rdquo;
of these chips became known, many hackers dropped
whatever they were working on and started reverse engineering the chips with all their might, in some
cases using the existing <span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft Windows</b></span>
drivers to guide them.

For those who like to watch traffic while it's passing, ibmonitor
allows you to do this. It shows you maximum traffic, data throughput
and average traffic as well as current traffic. Display is designed
to fit on the standard VT, although that depends on what you have
turned on and how many interfaces you have.
Requires: Perl, Perl module Term::ReadKey, Getopt::Long,
Term::ANSIColor and Data::Dumper.

If you find, for whatever reason, that MRTG isn't the tool for
you, but need something to show you the I/O on a router
interface (or even a host interface, like your mail or Web host),
check out ifGraph. By default, it creates graphs
for interface statistics and memory usage but should be adaptable to
most anything you can collect with SNMP. Requires: Perl, Perl modules FindBin, Getopt::Std, Net::SNMP,
File::Copy and rrdtool.

Mandrake Linux is now available on free computers
for schools and nonprofits in California from
the Technology Training Foundation of America
(TTFA). Since 1998, TTFA has accepted donated
computers from corporations in California and
provided computer access to more than 40,000
students. First, TTFA finds corporations wishing to
recycle computer hardware. Many corporations
replace between 20&ndash;30% of their desktop computers
annually, and TTFA eagerly anticipates those 2- to 4-year-old computers.
</p><p>
TFTA uses the services of refurbishing partners
throughout the state of California. TTFA
coordinates the transportation of the computers
to one of its 16 refurbishing partner sites,
nine of which are run by the California Department
of Corrections (CDC), that meet the applicant's
technology standards. The refurbishing partners
remove all data from the hard drives, repair or
replace components as necessary and configure
the computers to meet the needs of the recipient.
</p><p>
CDC and TTFA offer three choices for operating
systems and software, including Mandrake Linux
9.0 with OpenOffice.org, The GIMP and other standard
software packages. TTFA and CDC have the ability
to install additional software but require proof of
licensing before installing proprietary software.
</p><p>
TTFA accepts working monitors
and computers with a speed of 300MHz or faster.
TTFA is a statewide 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization located in San
Diego, California.
More information about TTFA and its computer donation program can be
obtained from their Web site at <a href="http://www.computers2learnby.org" target="_self">www.computers2learnby.org</a>.

People object that there is no economic model for it, but there is: the
economic model of flower-boxes...I put out flower-boxes to raise my
self-esteem and make my house look more attractive. If almost everyone
does it then the whole town becomes more beautiful. The same thing can
happen with communications. The challenge for telecom is to combine
wireless with very intelligent devices....The combination will allow us
to use spectrum in a very different way, in more efficient and organic
ways than before.

We were discussing the future challenges in information technology,
including the issues related to software security...I made a point that
we look for open-source codes so that we can easily introduce the
users-built security algorithms. Our discussions became difficult, since
our views were different....The most unfortunate thing is that India
still seems to believe in proprietary solutions....Further spread of IT,
which is influencing the daily life of individuals, would have a
devastating effect on the lives of society due to any small shift in the
business practice involving these proprietary solutions. It is precisely
for these reasons open-source software needs to be built, which would be
cost-effective for the entire society. In India, open-source code
software will have to come and stay in a big way for the benefit of our
billion people.

Three years ago I reviewed several good programs, but the hands down
winner for me was the text-based browser w3m. With the
large majority of systems today using frames and images, using a text
browser on the Internet can be a frustrating experience. Although great for
slow links or systems not running X, this is not ideal. However, w3m works
well with frames, allowing you to see multiple frames on the screen.
It also, depending on your build options, allows you to see some
graphics. The older Lynx has long since been replaced on my system
with w3m. Requires: libgc, libpthread, libm, libnsl, libgpm, libncurses, libssl,
libcrypt o, glibc, libstdc++, libdl and libgcc_s.

Forgiving the misleading name, watchfolder watches
directories for additions, then takes action on
those additions. It runs as a d&aelig;mon and can act
on new files or changed files as you configure
it. You do need to be careful of permissions, but it's perfect for a repetitive task. I print
files in Mozilla as PostScript into a watchme
directory, and watchfolder handles converting them
to PDFs and moving them into a another directory.
Requires: glibc.
