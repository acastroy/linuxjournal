Nothing beats the sound quality of a good LP record, but if you need
travel convenience, you can make a CD or Ogg Vorbis copy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1693580.0x178b1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Dory Previn inspired me to pursue this
project. She recorded a string of intelligent, literate albums in the
1970s, but by the early 1990s they still were not available on CD.
With a little searching, I found a package named gramofile by Anne
Bezemer and Ton Le designed to capture the sound of vinyl and prepare
it for burning to CD. Then, along came xmcd2make
by C. R. Johnson, which extends gramofile's functionality. Look
at the possibilities:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Preserve the music on inexpensive, durable media.
</p></li><li><p>
Have each track individually accessible with
timing details.
</p></li><li><p>
Encode to Ogg or MP3.
</p></li><li><p>
Apply click reduction filters to all or selected
tracks.
</p></li><li><p>
Leave out unwanted songs and rearrange the order.
</p></li><li><p>
Fit two albums onto one disk.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1693580.0x178b768"></a>
Preparing the Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Sound quality depends on many factors, as explained in the
&ldquo;Linux Audio Quality HOWTO&rdquo;, but with a quality sound card
and well-supported drivers. Try to keep the card away from other cards
to minimize induced noise. Because I'm using a spare PC solely for this
project, I have only two cards installed: video in the first PCI slot
and a SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 in the last PCI slot. If you plan to use
the PC for other tasks while capturing the LP to disk, use a kernel from the 2.4 series, apply the preempt-kernel
and lock-break patches (see Resources), select the new choices under
Processor type, then build and install it. I was pleasantly surprised
by the quality of sound on the CD from the first LP I processed.

Minimal Software</h2></div></div><p>
If you simply want to burn a CD, gramofile alone does the job.
Install it from an RPM or deb file. Figure 1 shows the main menu.
I discuss each step further later in this article. gramofile expects a mixer called
xmixer, which I found in a Debian package called mctools-lite, but in
the RPM world, it is in a package called multimedia. However, there's
no problem using whatever mixer you have in another window or console.

Deluxe Software</h2></div></div><p>
For the encoding of songs in Ogg or MP3 format, consider taking the extra
steps to install xmcd2make and its dependencies also. A bit of tedium
up front will simplify the processing of every album. The xmcd2make
scripts are simply that&mdash;Perl scripts whose installation amounts to
<tt  >make install</tt>. However, they won't work until swig, oggenc
(for Ogg encoding) or lame (for MP3), mpgtx and Perl module Getopt::Long
are installed. In addition, xmcd2make expects the special version
of gramofile that has perl-swig extensions, with a P
in the version name. So let's get to work. Because this machine is
dedicated to one task, I'll do all installs as root and untar
each package from /usr/local.
</p><p>
swig has progressed, but gramofile hasn't. Using the latest
version 1.3.17, the gramofile <tt  >make perl-swig</tt> failed. Using
Debian's older version 1.1.p883-4 (<tt  >apt-get install
swig</tt>),
the make completed. Here's the manual equivalent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf swig1.1-883.tar.gz
cd  SWIG1.1-883
./configure
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
oggenc should be available as RPM or deb packages, though the name
may be elusive. For Debian, I used <tt  >apt-get install vorbis-tools
libvorbis0</tt>. Lame may be harder to find due to patent issues, and
Ogg is the politically correct choice.
</p><p>
mpgtx, a command-line MPEG toolbox, is a simple <tt  >apt-get install
mpgtx</tt> in Debian, but I installed version 1.3 from source with the classic
<tt  >tar</tt>, <tt  >configure</tt>,
<tt  >make</tt>, <tt  >make install</tt> as in swig above. Though
pages of warnings scrolled by, it installed without complaint.
</p><p>
The Perl module Getopt::Long is part of Debian's 5.6.1 package,
and I hope it's in yours too. On my system it's installed
in /usr/share/perl/5.6.1/Getopt/Long.pm.
</p><p>
A manual install of gramofile with perl-swig extensions is not for
the timid. It requires ncurses5-dev and doesn't install itself.
You'll need to know where your Perl CORE resides, so try:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/lib
find -name CORE
./perl/5.6.1/CORE
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1693580.0x178c268"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This reveals that my Perl CORE is at /usr/lib/perl/5.6.1/CORE.
After untarring gramofile, edit the Makefile in the perl-swig
subdirectory, changing the line <tt  >PERLCORE = -I/usr/...</tt> to
match your installation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf gramofile-1.6P
cd gramofile-1.6P
cd perl-swig
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1693580.0x178c420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(edit the Makefile here)

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ..
make
make perl-swig
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's copy the executables into a directory that's
in your $PATH:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp gramofile bplay_gramo brec_gramo /usr/bin
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, <tt  >cd</tt> into the perl-swig subdirectory, and copy two
files from there into a directory in the Perl path. But first,
check your Perl path for a suitable directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl -e 'print join("\n",@INC), "\n"'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1693580.0x178c738"></a></h2></div></div><p>
So, in my Debian setup:



<pre     class="programlisting">
cd perl-swig
mkdir /usr/local/lib/site_perl
cp Gramofile.pm Gramofile.so /usr/local/lib/site_perl
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we're ready for xmcd2make:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf xmcd2make-0.4.tar.gz
cd xmcd2make-0.4
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
xmcd2make installs with a default bitrate of 128, but I prefer a higher
bitrate (at the expense of larger files and longer encoding time), so
I edited the file /usr/local/bin/xmcd2make and changed the bitrate to 224:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# $bitrate = 128;
$bitrate = 224;
</pre>
</p><p>
If you can stand one more item, I recommend a mixer called umix,
because it has a console version, offers numeric levels to set levels
accurately and repeatably, and the ability to save or restore all
settings with a single keystroke. This means the whole LP to CD process
can be done on a low-end PC without even installing X. The
default mixer path is /dev/sound/mixer, which you may want to adjust as
follows:
<tt  >./configure --with-mixer-dev=/dev/mixer</tt>. To load and save
levels as an ordinary user, start umix with a config filename, like
<tt  >umix -f $HOME/umixrc</tt>. Press S to save the current settings
and L to reload the last saved settings.

Basic Recording Procedure</h2></div></div><p>
Here are the steps to capture Dory's <span   class="emphasis"><em>On My Way
To Where</em></span> album to the hard drive, then process it to arrive at a set
of wav files suitable for burning an audio CD, plus a set of Ogg files
for use by computers and portable players. Eventually, we'll tell
xmcd2make the basename is &ldquo;where&rdquo;, so we name the
files appropriately.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Position the computer near your stereo, and connect stereo line out to your sound card line
in with a quality, shielded cable. You probably will need a dual
RCA-to-stereo mini-plug cable to make this connection.
</p></li><li><p>
Load your mixer in one console or xterm.
Load gramofile in another after changing to an empty directory on a
partition with a lot of free space.
</p></li><li><p>
Use the mixer to set &ldquo;line in&rdquo; to record mode
and to mute all other channels. You may need to bring up input gain (igain) too.
This reduces background noise.
</p></li><li><p>
Use gramofile's Record audio to a sound
file to capture a sample, and use the mixer to adjust levels to bring
the peaks on the gramofile level meter near the top.
</p></li><li><p>
Stop sampling, and verify that a reasonable
percent of samples were above 50% of max volume, a few above 90%, but
that few or none were above 99% (Figure 2).
</p></li><li><p>
Set gramofile to capture side one of the LP by
giving it a descriptive name, in our example, where1.wav; start playing the LP, then start capturing.
</p></li><li><p>
When side one is completed, stop gramofile and
verify that the sample levels are reasonable. If not, use your mixer
to adjust the levels. Some of the volume spikes are caused
by clicks, so a few clipped samples are acceptable.
</p></li><li><p>
Capture side two to a file called where2.wav.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6628f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. gramofile's Recording Information
</p></div></div><p>
Now we have two wav files of about 200MB each, digital representations
of the sound in the vinyl grooves. This is a good time to decide whether
this LP has significant surface noise&mdash;those clicks for which vinyl is famous. If the whole album is noisy, run both
sides through the filter(s) gramofile offers. If only selected songs
are noisy, typically the first track on each side, wait until the tracks
are split.
</p><p>
The gramofile documentation includes a fascinating discussion
(Signproc.txt) of each filter and the theory behind it. You'll
notice when choosing Process the audio signal that Conditional Median
Filter II already is selected. It's the most sophisticated, and
I had good results with it. Clicking noises aren't obliterated,
but they're greatly reduced. Multiple filters can be used,
or you can use the same filter twice. I stick with one pass because
when I used Conditional Median Filter II twice, there was a noticeable
degradation in the music. However, the process takes only a few minutes,
so feel free to experiment. The original file is preserved, and you have
the opportunity to give the filtered file a meaningful name. Listen
to this new wav file. If you like the result, delete the original and
rename the filtered file to be the same as the original.
</p><p>
Before encoding any tracks, you'll want a listing of the artist
name, album name and the title of every track. You can save some
typing by searching <a href="http://freedb.org" target="_self">freedb.org</a>. If your album is found, click on the
IDs link above the first track title, then save the page that comes
up as a text file. If you prefer, simply copy the listing from this
xmcd page and paste it into a text editor, ignoring any lines starting
with #. Be sure to save the file as plain text into the
directory where your wav files are, and name it to match. For our
example, that would be where.xmcd. In either case, all we'll be using are
DTITLE and TTITLE lines. For obscure LPs, I keep a copy of an xmcd file
with only DTITLE= and TTITLE0= thru TTITLE10= in my home directory. It
only takes a minute to copy it with a name to match the current LP,
then type in the titles from the album jacket. Notice that the track
listings start with zero. Here's a partial sample:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DTITLE=Dory Previn / On My Way To Where
TTITLE0=Scared To Be Alone
TTITLE1=I Ain't His Child
</pre>
</p><p>
Our task now is to split each side into individual songs. Straight
gramofile users can choose Locate tracks from the menu, then choose
side one (where1.wav), click Next, click Start computation and wait
for the song count to come up. If the count is not correct, try again
but adjust one or more of the options before Start computation. Try
reducing intertrack silence to 12 or less. Repeat for side two. When
you're happy with the track counts, choose Process the audio signal;
choose the side one wav file again; click Next; then, tab through to the
&ldquo;Next&rdquo; screen if you want to use the default click filter. To
use no filter, stop at the Available filters box, highlight Copy only
and press the Enter key. Now tab to the Selected filters box, highlight
Conditional Median Filter II and press the R key to remove it. Use the
same procedure to choose a different (or additional) filter, but you must
select either a filter or Copy only to process the files. Incidentally,
pressing the Enter key while a filter is highlighted in the Selected
filters box allows you to change specific filter settings. Finally,
tab to Start and press Enter. When it completes, you should have a wav
file for each track, ready for test listening and then burning.
</p><p>
xmcd2make users should exit gramofile, as xmcd2make's findtracks
script is a wrapper around gramofile's findtracks function. Run
<tt  >findtracks where1.wav</tt> from the prompt to scan album side one,
then compare its output with the official track listing. Type <tt  >less
*.tracks</tt>, and you'll see a plain-text file with start and stop
timings for each track. If you see two tracks lumped together,
go back to the prompt and try again with one or more of the parameters
adjusted, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
findtracks where1.wav --min-silence-blocks 12
</pre>
</p><p>
It's possible, though tedious, to split the songs manually.
A crude
alternative is to burn the whole side as a single track. In this case,
use gramofile's filter, but choose Copy only (as explained above
but unchecking the Split tracks option), which would do no filtering
but would add timing information to the wav file, so the CD burner would
know the true running time. If you find a song split in two, it's
easy to edit the tracks file to merge the two, then renumber the rest
of the tracks on that side and edit the
<tt  >Number_of_tracks=</tt>
line to match. Finally, repeat the whole process for side 2.
</p><p>
Now, we're ready to create a Makefile, which automates the rest
of the process:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xmcd2make --basename where --counts 5,5 &gt; Makefile
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1693580.0x1b85c70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This creates a Makefile that includes the timing for splitting
the tracks and the album, artist and trackname information for Ogg or
MP3 creation. The counts must match those in the track's files. To adjust
the bitrate, add <tt  >--rate 192</tt>, for example. Now simply typing
<tt  >make</tt> copies each track's content to a separate wav
file and encodes it to an Ogg file with a descriptive name. Here's
an abbreviated directory listing from our example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Makefile                    9.5k
where1.wav                  196M
where1.wav.tracks           1.2k
where2.wav                  191M
where2.wav.tracks           1.2k
where_processed_101.wav      52M
101_Scared_To_Be_Alone.ogg  8.2M
</pre>
</p><p>
Use <tt  >make mp3</tt> to split tracks and create MP3 files instead of
Ogg files. Typing <tt  >make proc</tt> simply splits the tracks, allowing you
to apply a filter to selected tracks. By deleting the original unfiltered
file and renaming the filtered file to the original name,
<tt  >make</tt>
creates an Ogg file from the filtered wav file. For more options,
try <tt  >xmcd2make --help</tt>.
</p><p>
There you have it&mdash;wav files to burn to an audio CD-R and Ogg
files to play back on any capable device or burn to a data CD-R. If
you're new to CD burning, there are many fine HOWTOs available.
Once you've set up the system, you can repeat it for stacks
of albums and enjoy the results. By the way, in 2002 the last of
Dory's albums finally were re-issued on CD, but I already have
my Linux-made disks.
