Bend X to your will with scripting tools, keyboard customizations and
dialog boxes.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1976138"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux offers graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) with high
resolution, multiple windows and menus. But with a GUI, human/computer
interaction is the real speed bottleneck: as long as doing something requires
ten mouse clicks in ten different points, it takes the same amount of
time, regardless of the hardware.
At the command line, the traditional UNIX answer is the toolbox
philosophy. You can automate anything with a script and connect small
specialized programs with pipes.
A third solution combines the two approaches and is easy and
powerful enough to suit most needs. Any stock X environment, regardless
of the window manager or desktop environment, can become much faster
and more flexible than it usually is.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1976240"></a>Making Your Own Mouse and Keyboard</h2></div></div><p>
We have more fingers than hands and 101 keys to one
mouse. Although drawing and similar tasks are quicker with mice or tablets,
often our fingers must stay on the keyboard anyway. If a command
or choice requires one single user action, pressing a key or two is much
faster than clicking mouse buttons, not to mention RSI issues. Also,
when we do touch the mouse, it should do what we need immediately.
</p><p>
Keys and mouse buttons can be shuffled around or mapped to
specific meanings (accented vowels) or GUI actions (maximize window)
using <b  >xmodmap</b>. One of its beneficiaries has been left-handed people,
who use it to reverse the order of the mouse buttons. Add this line in .xinitrc, or put
the quoted part in a .xmodmaprc file:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"
</pre><p>
Lately, xmodmap has been used to make mouse wheels work correctly under
Linux (see Resources). It also can make wheels work faster by binding your most frequent
actions to those extra keys available on the latest keyboards. For
example, the magic line for an IntelliMouse Explorer is:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"
</pre><p>
When speaking about keyboards, modifier means a key that changes the
effect or state of other keys. The standard modifiers are Shift, Ctrl,
Lock, Alt and five more simply called modN, with N=1,2..5. xmodmap can
assign these meanings to any physical keys. The most frequent case is
probably the swapping of the Ctrl and Caps Lock keys, described in the man
page. On the same note, the meaning of the Windows key could be changed
to mod4 in this way, assuming its keycode is 115:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xmodmap -e 'keycode 115 = Alt_R Meta_R'
</pre><p>
Keys can be programmed to start applications too, but this is
specific to window managers. In Blackbox 0.65, for example, keystrokes
are mapped to programs with the bbkeys utility. A line like the following
in $HOME/.bbkeysrc:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

KeyToGrab(F1),WithModifier(None),WithAction(ExecCommand),\
DoThis(xterm -geometry 80x25 -e mutt)

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1976710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would allow you to start mutt in an 80 &times; 25 xterm window by simply pressing F1. Many
other window managers allow such bindings; check their documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1976818"></a>
Point-and-Click Scripting</h2></div></div><p>
As already mentioned, any shell script can be given windows to
enable communication with the user, and any graphical client (and X itself)
can receive direct input from text programs. The first case happens when
a shell script needs user interaction, but it isn't possible; say
the user would rather die than type or there isn't a
keyboard (Internet kiosks). The second scenario includes users who need to pass some unpredictable
text to an X client from console programs without manual cut-and-paste
capabilities. This <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> happen in real life: mutt and lynx may be
all we need to read e-mail and surf the Net, but what if some e-mail or
Web page says &ldquo;Check out this movie preview&rdquo;, and you want to start
Mozilla on that page with one click.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x19769d0"></a>
Giving Windows to Shell Scripts</h2></div></div><p>
Starting an X window from a script has been possible for at least
ten years, with tools like the now defunct Xscript. A modern solution is
Xdialog, a GTK+-based widget generator. The script in Listing 1 shows
an almost real-life example; it lets the user choose the best ISP,
the account to be used and where to log the connection report. It then
starts a traditional pppd/chat script (called netconn in the example),
passing to it all the parameters collected graphically. Let's
examine the GUI side in detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1976ad8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. GUI Front End for an Internet Connection Script</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">


#! /bin/bash

/bin/rm -f /tmp/netsettings

echo -n "PROVIDER=" &gt; /tmp/netsettings
Xdialog --menubox "ISP selection menu" 20 40 5 \
"ISP_1"  "Lowest price in business hours"  \
"ISP_2" "More economic on weekends"       \
"ISP_3"     "Fastest ftp server" 2&gt;&gt; /tmp/netsettings

RETVAL=$?
# add control code here

echo -n "ACCOUNT=" &gt;&gt; /tmp/netsettings
Xdialog --inputbox "Enter account name"  10 25 \
"son" 2&gt;&gt; /tmp/netsettings

echo -n "LOGFILE=" &gt;&gt; /tmp/netsettings
Xdialog -fselect /tmp 20 80  2&gt;&gt; /tmp/netsettings

source /tmp/netsettings
netconn $PROVIDER $ACCOUNT $LOGFILE


</pre></div><p>
The script starts removing the old version of the netsettings file,
which stores all the user choices. For each variable needed by
the netconn script, an assignment line in bash syntax is written
to /tmp/netsettings. The left part simply is echoed without newline
(<tt  >echo -n</tt>). The second part, the actual value chosen by
the user, is captured by Xdialog.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6415f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Invoking Xdialog
</p></div></div><p>
The first invocation (see Figure 1) allows the user to choose the
best ISP. We also added some explanatory text (ISP selection menu)
and specified the height (20) and width (40) of the window, as well as the
height of each entry (5). In the case of Figure 1, after the user presses
the OK button, /tmp/netsettings will contain this one line:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PROVIDER=ISP_1
</pre><p>
Error checking can and should happen by saving the exit code
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> call to Xdialog in a variable (RETVAL in Listing 1) and
checking it to know what the user really did. We omitted this code for
brevity, but keep in mind that a RETVAL of 1 means &ldquo;Cancel
pressed&rdquo;; 255 means the user closed the box, and 0 means
a choice actually was made.
</p><p>
The second Xdialog command allows the user to type in an account name
or to accept the default value (Figure 2). The
last one (Figure 3), displays a file selection window in which one can
type or select with the mouse the name and location of the
current log file. At this point, all the user choices are in
/tmp/netsettings, so we simply must source that file and launch the
connection.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6415f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6415f3.large.jpg"><img src="6415f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Finding the Log File
</p></div></div><p>
Xdialog offers many more types of input widgets, from radio buttons to range
slides and calendars. Quite a few of these provide feedback to the
user. The author uses the <tt  >--msgbox</tt> option, for example, to pop up a window listing how
many messages have been downloaded by fetchmail, sorted by account. Other
possibilities include gauge and progress bars, info boxes with timeouts
and file display windows. Consequently, Xdialog can be attached to
scripts doing CD burning, audio and video playback, backups&mdash;you name it.
</p><p>
What if the same script must be used when X is not running? No problem;
menus and boxes can be drawn in character terminals, too. Simply use the
character-oriented equivalent, dialog.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x19775d8"></a>
Passing Text to X</h2></div></div><p>
Returning to the URL example, we can pass a URL to a browser without
typing by using xclip, which captures the last mouse selection and echoes it.
We put it together with the utility gnome-moz-remote, which
either starts a new instance of Mozilla or opens the given URL with
your already-running Mozilla. Put the following command in a script:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

gnome-moz-remote --newwin "'xclip -o'" \
&amp;&gt; /dev/null &amp;

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1977738"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Call it start_browser.sh, and bind it to a macro to run it from the
application that must be enabled to launch external clients. In mutt,
such a macro could be:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

macro pager \cn "!start_browser.sh\n" 'open URL'

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1977898"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At this point, whenever we see a URL inside mutt, we'll simply
highlight it with the mouse and press Ctrl-N. Inside the script, xclip
echoes the selected text, and everything is as if we had started
the browser by hand and then typed that text in the Location window.
</p><p>
xclip has a couple of distant cousins, xclipboard and xcutsel, that
manage the X clipboard and cut buffer. These two programs are useful
when it is necessary to see the clipboard content and to move
the selection between applications that don't support them.
Check the related man pages for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x19779f8"></a>
Click Emulation</h2></div></div><p>
How do we make X believe we are moving the cursor with the
mouse and using its buttons when we actually are pressing or releasing
keys? The xbut program performs both these tasks. You can set up a simple
configuration file to make keys work like mouse movements or clicks.
</p><p>
It is possible to go even farther with xwit, the X Window Interactive
Tool, which directly <span   class="emphasis"><em>places</em></span> the X pointer to an absolute screen
position. Besides warping the pointer, xwit moves and iconifies windows.
To iconify the current xterm, sleep, and then pop it back up, use:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xwit -iconify; sleep 2; xwit -pop
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1977c60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This tool can be handy for long-running tasks; substitute the program
name for the sleep command, and it will iconify the window, do the work
and get back in your face when it's done.
</p><p>
Finally, a flexible X-automation tool is xte, part of the xautomation
package. Use <tt  >xte -h</tt> to see a list of the X events it supports.
This example goes to a point 320 pixels from the left edge of the
screen and 50 pixels down and then fakes a click there with button 1:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

xte 'mousemove 320 50' 'mousedown 1'
'mouseup 1'

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1d700c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The mousedown and mouseup events are separate, so you can drag as
well as click.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1d701c8"></a>
A Password-Aware Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
A fast and effective environment is one in which you can start
any authorized process (whether in the background or interactive, text or
GUI-based) on every other machine to which you have access as quickly,
securely and transparently as possible. Of course, the right way to
do it is through OpenSSH. But even if you're using RSA or DSA
authentication for security&mdash;and to save having to remember a password
per host&mdash;you have to type your SSH passphrase for every connection.
Luckily, a valuable SSH partner, ssh-agent, remembers your
SSH private key or keys and takes over the job of performing any
authentication that requires the private key. Practically speaking, this means if you start X as a child process
of ssh-agent, every local X client started later is able to use
ssh-agent for authentication.
</p><p>
You can start your window manager as a child of ssh-agent in .xinitrc or
.Xsession; put ssh-agent before the window manager. If you have
<tt  >sawfish</tt>, change it to <tt  >ssh-agent
sawfish</tt>, and everything that runs in your X session, including any SSH
programs, will be able to use ssh-agent.
</p><p>
GNOME starts ssh-agent by default. To add it to KDE, find your KDE
startup script and add ssh-agent to it as you would for a window manager.
</p><p>
The ssh-add command is the one that actually makes available
identities known to the agent. You can make sure ssh-agent is running
and knows your identity with <tt  >ssh-add -L</tt>.
</p><p>
If the computer is left unattended, everybody walking by has
immediate access, no questions asked, to all hosts where you can log in.
Log out, or use <tt  >ssh-add -D</tt> to delete your identity from
the agent.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1d70590"></a>
Finding Events</h2></div></div><p>
We explained how the numerical keycodes corresponding to extra
keys can be remapped to mean other events, but how does one come to
know them in the first place? The solution is the diagnostic tool xev,
which opens an Event Tester window and reports in the original
terminal everything that happens to that window. On the author's
system, pressing the left Windows key returns (notice the keycode value
and comments):
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
KeyRelease event, serial 23, synthetic NO, window
&#8618;0x1000001,
 root 0x46, subw 0x0, time 1108438536, (175,176),
 root:(627,425), state 0x40, keycode 115
 &#8618;(keysym 0xffeb,
 Super_L), same_screen YES, XLookupString gives
 &#8618;0 characters:
 ""
</pre><p>
Last but not least, screenshots are necessary to show off your
shell script GUIs, aren't they? Even in this case, plain X and
ImageMagick suffice, without needing fancier front ends installed. The images
for this article all were grabbed and converted to PNG format with the
following standard commands, all properly documented in their man pages:

<pre     class="programlisting">

xwd -out temp_image -frame
xwdtopnm temp_image  &gt; fig1.pnm
convert fig1.pnm fig1.png

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1d707a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first command dumps the window selected with the cursor, frame
included, into temp_image, and the second and the third convert that
file first to &ldquo;portable anymap&rdquo;, then to PNG format. It goes
without saying that these three commands may be inserted easily in a
shell script that asks, through Xdialog, which to grab (screen or window)
and in which file to save the result.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x187e580.0x1d70900"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
For many users, the standard, full-blown desktop environments have either
too many features, which slow the PC down, or too few to fulfill their
specific needs. The tools and techniques described here can help users
greatly improve their productivity and also can be a lifesaver whenever the
same PC is shared by CLI and mouse addicts.
