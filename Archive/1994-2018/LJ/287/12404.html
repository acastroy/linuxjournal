Re: "How Wizards and Muggles Break Free from the Matrix"</h3>

<p>
Yesterday I was wondering why there isn't a more organized resistance to the
CopperTopping of humanity, as I tried to watch Amazon Prime on my "Smart" TV
without telling Google more about me. I remember—circa 2000—when I was
the only person I knew who was concerned. Now there is a fairly large
contingent actively concerned. But, effectively, nobody is doing
anything—because effectively nobody knows how to.
</p>

<p>
Oh, yeah, there is complaining. And there are occasional expressions of
concern from a various and small contingent of companies and legislators. And
then there is your article; although notably your article starts with "How"
but—again—doesn't say anything specific enough to deserve its title. So,
in that regard, <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-wizards-and-muggles-break-free-matrix">your
article</a> is a bit of the circle-jerk itself, even if its
expression is backed by good intentions.
</p>

<p>
The techie Priesthood still holds nearly all the specialized knowledge
required to even attempt to break away without going "third world" (forgoing
a mobile phone, forgoing a TV, forgoing using a credit card).
WHY doesn't <em>Linux Journal</em> begin giving specific HOW advice and, better yet,
use its pages to cultivate groups of people required to liberate through
TEACHING how to do? A step-by-step for those concerned but not sufficiently
in the priesthood.
</p>

<p>
A great article, to start with, would be specific recommendations on "Smart"
TVs that best protect privacy and specific, direct means to short-circuit
Google, under its myriad names and minions, from all our devices. I don't
ask for perfection here; only a reasonable and sustained start with some
path
forward for the hundreds of millions of humans who are pretty smart, pretty
concerned, yet not hardware-geeks enough to know how to break out of the
twisty-turny maze that keeps changing through time and between models?
I'd love to join THAT organization—I'd even subscribe to THAT magazine.
</p>

<p>
—Gnat
</p>

<p>
<strong>Doc Searls replies:</strong> Thanks, Gnat.
</p>

<p>
I'll address your uppercase HOW and TEACHING concerns separately.
</p>

<p>
Above a bulleted list in <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-wizards-and-muggles-break-free-matrix">that
piece</a>, I say "Here's a punch list of what we
need to do." I should have added "—and HOW" to that
sentence. Because, if you go to the links in that list, you'll find lots
of HOWs. Specifically:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The link behind "<a href="http://customercommons.org/terms">Customer Commons' work on terms individuals can proffer
as first parties, and others—primarily sites and services—can agree
to, in ways both can record in case a dispute arises</a>" goes to that work.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a> in Europe all but requires these kinds of agreements, by the way.
I'll be writing about that again soon too.
</li>

<li>
<em>Linux Journal</em> will be <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/help-us-cure-online-publishing-its-addiction-personal-data">the
first site in the world to agree to a first party
Customer Commons term proffered by its readers</a>.
</li>

<li>
Personal control of how we are known (if at all) to others in the online
world is coming to be called <a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Inevitable-Rise-of-Self-Sovereign-Identity.pdf">self-sovereign
identity</a>. That link goes to a
white paper on the topic by the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin
Foundation</a>.
</li>

<li>
Since one way sovereign (independent, liberated, free, autonomous)
individuals can present their choice of identifiers (or absence of those,
since identifiers are usually not required for any two parties to interact
or do business) is through <a href="http://customercommons.org/terms"><em>verifiable claims</em></a>, and systems for recording
those tend to include blockchains, I have that link going to a search for
verifiable+claims+blockchain.
</li>

<li>
For "<a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/projectvrm/EmanciPay">Pay what we want, where we want it, and how we pay for whatever we
want, in our own ways</a>", I point to an approach called EmanciPay. I
invite geeks to build it.
</li>

<li>
I explain "<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/customers-need-scale-f8e045b90304">Change
what all the companies we deal with know about us—such
as our phone number, our last name or our email address, <em>in one
move</em></a>", in a
piece titled "Customers need scale". Same goes for "<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/customers-need-scale-f8e045b90304">Call for service
or support in one simple and straightforward way of our own</a>."</li>

<li>
"<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2015/08/16/loyalty-means-nothing-if-customers-dont-have-their-own-ways-of-expressing-it">Express
loyalty in our own ways</a>" goes to a piece titled "Loyalty
means nothing if customers don't have their own ways of expressing
it." This is do-able too.
</li>

<li>
The link for "<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2013/02/the_internet_of_my_things_and_the_api_of_me.shtml">a
true Internet of Things</a>" goes to <a href="http://www.windley.com">Phil
Windley</a>'s post titled
"The Internet of My Things Needs the API of Me". Phil and his coding
colleagues (many of whom are students of Phil's at BYU) have already created
some of the code required. I'd like to see more geeks involved.
</li>

<li>
Behind the "<a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2015/01/17/the-answer-is-cft-clouds-for-things">giving
each (thing) its own cloud</a>" is a post of mine titled "The
answer is #CFT: Clouds For Things", which was inspired by work already
done by Phil and friends.
</li>

<li>
"<a href="http://hieofone.org">Own and control all our health and fitness
records</a>" goes to a project
called HIE of One, which is explained <a href="http://hieofone.org/about">here</a>. It's led by Adrian Gropper,
an MD (Harvard) and tech wizard (MIT).
</li>

<li>
The link behind "<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/market-intelligence-that-flows-both-ways-e822fa74530">generously sharing helpful facts about how we use their
products and services</a>" goes to a post titled "Market intelligence that flows
both ways". In it I unpack the huge implications of code that's
already in the world.
</li>

<li>
The links behind "have <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2012/10/22/lets-talk-wallets-at-iiw">wallets</a>
and <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2012/09/22/browsers-should-have-been-cars-instead-theyre-shopping-carts">shopping
carts</a> that are our own" go
to old posts that wizards should revisit before working on either of those
tools. We've always needed them, but wizards keep designing ones that
work only in corporate silos. Time to fix that.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To your point about TEACHING: sure, we should do that. We also
should remember that lots of others are doing that already. This 
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=how+to+defeat+spying+tv&amp;oq=how+to+defeat+spying+tv">search</a>
gets more than a half million results.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, one good invention can get adoption by dozens of millions
in a short time.
</p>

<p>
Twenty years ago, Marc Andreessen told me "All the significant trends
start with technologists." (That was in an interview I did with him for
<em>Linux Journal</em>, titled <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2984">"Betting on Darwin"</a>.) Lots of significant trends
followed work he and his colleagues did as technologists then.
</p>

<p>
One of our jobs here is to encourage development of inventions that cause
necessity for everybody—wizards and muggles alike. Not everything we do
is "a reasonable and sustained start with some path forward for the hundreds
of millions of humans". But that is pretty much what we've tried to
do during the last 24 years. We've succeeded in some cases and
failed in others.
</p>

<p>
I believe "Breaking Free of the Matrix" is the most important work we've
encouraged since our early efforts to spread the Linux word. That's why I
wrote that piece. Again, I invite readers to help us succeed with that.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
I'm Pleased</h3>

<p>
I read Doc Searls' <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/privacy-still-personal">"Privacy Is
Still Personal"</a> editorial in the May 2018 issue and agree completely. The Wintendo generation
(kids, now parents who grew up with Nintendo and Windows) doesn't get this.
I want privacy. I'm only a little person, but others could do great damage
to me if they got hold of my numbers (SS#, drivers license, DOB, etc.). Do
you remember <em>PC Mag</em> when it was almost an inch thick? That's how you
attract. Stop targeting.
</p>

<p>
I will fully support you folks. Let me know how I can help.
</p>

<p>
—Roy Niemann
</p>

<p>
<strong>Doc Searls replies:</strong> Thanks for your support, Roy. We appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
About privacy, everybody wants it, or they wouldn't wear clothes. The
fact that we don't have it yet online is a matter of absent tech, not
absent consciousness. Invention is the mother of necessity. When we develop
good personal privacy tech, people will need it. Nobody needed a smart phone
before Apple and Google made the market for them. Now almost nobody can get
along without one. Here at <em>Linux Journal</em>, we're doing what we can, in our
own ways, to foster that market—and we need all the help we can get!
</p>

<p>
Second, by coincidence, I wrote for the first inch-thick <em>PC Magazine</em>, back
when it started in 1982. I still have a copy around here somewhere. My
contribution was a story on Ken Uston's Professional Blackjack, a game
for IBM PCs and Apple IIs that taught card counting. (Geek item: it was
written, as I recall, in Forth.) I also edited the game manual, which
I'm amazed to find still selling on Amazon. (I also just found that you
can run it in emulation, through a link at <a href="https://archive.org">Archive.org</a>.)
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Nextcloud</h3>

<p>
Regarding Marco Fioretti's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/nextcloud-13-how-get-started-and-why-you-should">"Nextcloud 13: How to Get Started and Why You
Should"</a> in the May 2018 issue, I have been using Nextcloud since I switched to it from
OwnCloud a little more than a year ago. It is an excellent app for me! I am
running 13.02 on Ubuntu 17.10 with MySQL and PHP 7.1. One thing I would
like
to point out, and that you may want to cover in an article relatively soon,
is
backing up the installation with recovery in mind. I was running my
instance
on an old Toshiba Satellite (about six years old), and all was well until it
was
not. Fortunately, I use storeBackup, which is aimed at an external USB drive
(0.5 Terabyte). A nightly database dump (MySQL) along with the files in
the
Nextcloud data directory almost got me back to where I needed to be.
As it turned out, the passman addon would not function properly based on my
recovery strategy, and it was a bit tough to get everything synced back up
with regard to devices and files. (I bought a newer used Toshiba laptop as
my new server and went from Bodhi 4.0 to Ubuntu 17.10.) I did get
everything
back up to snuff, but had I done a better job of using storeBackup, it would
have taken a lot less time. I don't think that would have made a difference
with passman, but it certainly would have with Calendar, Contacts and Files!
One other note: there is an addon that is very useful to me that you may
want to mention for those with health issues, and that is the DICOM viewer.
I always get a DVD of my medical images, and the DICOM viewer works very
nicely for showing medical images to a new provider who does not have
immediate access to one's medical records from other providers. At least
they
can see what I am talking about, and that sometimes saves me a return trip
and
another office visit co-pay. Very cool!
Thanks for writing this up! A good article!
</p>

<p>
—Wes Wieland
</p>

<p>
<strong>Marco Fioretti replies:</strong> Thanks for your compliments! I'm obviously happy you
liked the article.
</p>

<p>
What you say about the Dicom viewer is great. It's
a real-world example of the power of open standards, and personal/self-hosted clouds to overcome the limits and annoyances of proprietary,
non-interoperable systems. I must remember to mention your case next
time I speak on those topics.
</p>

<p>
About covering backups in an article "relatively soon", <em>Linux Journal</em>
and I are planning more Nextcloud articles, but the details aren't
all defined yet, so we'll see. One general lesson that your email illustrates
well is that Nextcloud backup depends heavily on which <em>combination</em>
of applications are installed, and also on if/how they interact with
<em>other</em> Nextcloud installations. So, I'll need to think about how to
explain this well in one article, but I definitely will keep your
suggestions in mind!
</p>

Librem Review</h3>

<p>
Wow! Regarding Shawn Powers' <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/review-librem-13v2">review of the
Librem 13v2</a> in the May 2018 issue,
where were you last week when I was shopping for a new laptop? I have
been eyeing the Librem for a long time and wanted to get an honest, full review
before pulling the trigger. Your review rocked, and it made me happy to know
I chose well last week when I ordered one. Now if it will just ship!
</p>

<p>
I have used Linux on the server for many, many years, and I've tried to transition
to the desktop many times over the years. I have been a Mac guy until last
November when I built a desktop, and I've been living in Linux ever since. Year of
the Linux Desktop indeed! Now if my Librem will get here, I will be complete.
</p>

<p>
I will say the only thing I am really missing is a Calendar/Contacts
solution to rival Mac's iCloud integration. I don't want to give Google all
my info and would like to have desktop app solutions. For now, it's
Thunderbird, but I would love to hear other solutions if any exist.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for keeping <em>LJ</em> going.

Great Review of Librem 13v2</h3>

<p>
I loved Shawn's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/review-librem-13v2">review of the
Purism Librem 13v2 laptop</a> in the May 2018 issue
of <em>Linux Journal</em>. And, what perfect timing! I am shopping around for a new
laptop, and I already was looking at the Librem 13.
</p>

<p>
Shawn's review was a great summary of the Librem 13's features, especially the
keyboard and trackpad—always a concern when buying a new laptop. I also
appreciated Shawn's discussion of the quirks, which was an honest review
about what to expect.

Everything You Need to Know about the Cloud and Cloud Computing</h3>

Reading it was a pleasure. Normally I look at articles like this and know that I

Because most people cannot write a technical article and make it interesting.

Surprised</h3>

<p>
In <em>Linux Journal</em> March 2018, I read the article
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/looking-back-what-was-happening-ten-years-ago">"Looking
Back: What Was Happening Ten Years Ago?"</a>
by Glyn Moody,
and I was very much surprised to see that he writes this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Another name figured quite prominently in my columns of ten years ago:
Firefox. Along with the Apache web server, it is one of open source's
great success stories, taking on Microsoft's slow and bloated Internet
Explorer, and winning. At the time, it seemed like Mozilla might be able to
build on the <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-can-we-harness-firefox-effect">success
of Firefox</a> to strengthen the <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-should-mozilla-execute-its-vision">wider
open-source ecosystem</a>.
Mozilla is still with us, and it's <a href="https://www.recode.net/2016/7/7/12116296/marissa-mayer-deal-mozilla-yahoo-payment">doing
rather well financially</a>, but it
has had less success with its share of the web browser market. As
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Web_browser_usage_share,_May_2017.svg">graph
on Wikipedia</a> shows, Firefox's ascent came to a halt around 2010,
and its market share has been in decline pretty much ever since. That's
not to say that Mozilla is not important to the world of free
software—partly because of its solid finances, it does much valuable work
in many related fields. But Firefox has become something of a niche browser,
used mostly by die-hard supporters.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And in the same issue, you cite Firefox as the <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/best-web-browser-0">"Best Web
Browser"</a>:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Best Web Browser</strong>
</p>

<ul><li>
Firefox: 57%
</li>

<li>
Chrome: 17%
</li>

<li>
Chromium: 7%
</li>

<li>
Vivaldi: 6%
</li>

<li>
Opera: 4%
</li>

<li>
Brave: 3%
</li>

<li>
qutebrowser: 2%
</li>
</ul>

<p>
How should I interpret this?
</p>

<p>
—Wolf-Dieter Klotz
</p>

<p>
<strong>Glyn Moody replies:</strong> Thanks for your email. In fact, there's no contradiction between the
browser statistics I quoted and Firefox's position in the Readers'
Choice Awards 2018.
</p>

<p>
The first is an estimate of Firefox's share of the overall market
share, including all browsers, all operating systems and all users.
In that world, Firefox has seen a steady decline to its present
levels, largely driven by the rise of Chrome.
</p>

<p>
The second figure, 57%, represents the proportion of <em>Linux Journal</em>
readers who think Firefox is the best browser. That concerns a much
smaller sample size, which obviously has important differences from
the general user population.
</p>

<p>
<em>Linux Journal</em> readers are likely to place a greater emphasis on open-source, privacy protection and related matters. Firefox also regards
those things as priorities, which helps explain why it is much more popular
among <em>Linux Journal</em> readers than among the general population, who may
not value them so highly.
