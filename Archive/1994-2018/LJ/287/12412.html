<h1 class="title">Why You Should Do It Yourself</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_11">
Bring back the DIY movement and start with your own Linux servers. By Kyle
Rankin</h2>

<p>
It wasn't very long ago that we lived in a society where it was a given
that average people would do things themselves. There was a built-in
assumption that you would perform basic repairs on household items, do general
maintenance and repairs on your car, mow your lawn, cook your food and
patch your clothes. The items around you reflected this assumption with
visible and easy-to-access screws, spare buttons sewn on the bottom of
shirts and user-replaceable parts.
</p>

<p>
Through the years though, culture has changed toward one more focused on
convenience. The microeconomic idea of "opportunity cost" (an idea that
you can assign value to each course of action and weigh it against
alternative actions you didn't take) has resulted in many people who
earn a reasonable wage concluding that they should do almost nothing
themselves. 
</p>

<p>
The typical thinking goes like this: if my hourly wage is
higher than the hourly cost of a landscaping service, even though that
landscaping service costs me money, it's still <em>cheaper</em> than if I
mowed my own lawn, because I could somehow be earning my hourly wage
doing something else. This same calculation ends up justifying oil-change and landscaping services, microwave TV dinners and replacing
items when they break instead of repairing them yourself. The result
has been a switch to a service-oriented economy, with the advent of cheaper,
more disposable items that hide their screws and vehicles that are all
but hermetically sealed under the hood.
</p>

<p>
This same convenience culture has found its way into technology, with
entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley wracking their brains to think of
some new service they could invent to do some new task for you. Linux
and the Open Source movement overall is one of the few places where you
can still find this do-it-yourself ethos in place. 
</p>

<p>
When referring to
proprietary software, Linux users used to say "You wouldn't buy a car with
the hood welded shut!" With Linux, you can poke under the hood and see
exactly how the system is running. The metaphorical screws are exposed,
and you can take the software apart and repair it yourself if you are so
inclined. Yet to be honest, so many people these days <em>would</em> buy a car
with the hood welded shut. They also are fine with buying computers and
software that are metaphorically welded shut all justified by convenience
and opportunity cost.
</p>

<p>
Yet there is something missing in most of these opportunity cost
calculations—the less tangible benefit you get from increased
knowledge and skills when you figure out how things work and how to repair
them, and the satisfaction and pride you feel when you see the results of
your own efforts. When you do things yourself, the mystique starts to fade
away, and you realize that most of the things around you aren't nearly as
complex or magical or inaccessible as you once thought they were. The
increased confidence you got when repairing your lamp might encourage
you to figure out how to replace that faulty light switch in your house.
</p>

<p>
With the advent of cloud services, it's incredibly easy to have someone
else set up Linux and open-source services for you, and when they break,
throw them away and start from scratch. However, this convenience comes with
a cost of its own, and not just the hourly rate for your servers. These
services and abstraction layers make things easier to use but harder to
understand. It adds a mystique to technology and makes it seem much
more complex than it really is under the hood. It also makes it easy to avoid
learning how things actually work and hard to learn how to fix them.
</p>

<p>
When I started out with Linux on the desktop, I essentially got an
education in software development, networking and system administration
as part of just making Linux work. Using Linux as a server platform immersed
me in computer fundamentals even more. I learned more about Linux by
breaking something and then fixing it myself than I ever would have in
a certification class or by handing it off to tech support. I learned
more about networking fundamentals by physically connecting two Linux
servers and trying to get them to talk to each other than I ever would
by clicking a few buttons in a cloud dashboard.
</p>

<p>
These days Linux has become a lot easier to use, but along with that ease,
we've lost most of those built-in learning opportunities. How do 
new junior engineers learn how networking really works these days? How
do they learn how to fix a broken Linux server? I want to encourage you
to search for these learning opportunities. Learn what's going on under
the hood. Get a spare Raspberry Pi and set up your own web, DHCP, DNS
and email servers from scratch. 
</p>

<p>
Eventually that server will break, and if
you don't give up, with a bit of research and troubleshooting, you'll
be able to fix it all yourself. In the process, you'll find this stuff
really isn't as complex as you thought it was, and you'll find yourself
wondering: what <em>else</em> can I do myself?
</p>

<p>
You gain something else when you do it yourself—independence,
freedom and control. One of the real risks with proprietary software is
the fact that control (and freedom) is taken away from you, as you are
beholden to the software vendor to patch bugs and add features. There
are countless examples of developers who got their start in open-source
software because they wanted to add one extra feature to an existing
program, fix one annoying bug or get some random piece of hardware
working. Because the source code was available, they could freely
inspect it, learn how the software worked and figure out how to change
it themselves.
</p>

<p>
So, next time that cloud server is spitting out 500 errors and you have no
idea why, resist the temptation to kill it and spawn a new one. Take a
minute to poke under the hood and see if you can figure out the problem
yourself. The next time you need some new service around the house, resist
the urge to buy some shiny IoT gadget. See if you can make it yourself
with a Raspberry Pi or Arduino and a little bit of software. After
all, that's what most of these IoT devices are underneath their shiny
exteriors. Sure it may take a little more time, but when your neighbor's
IoT appliance starts DDoS-ing the internet at large, you'll have the
skills to help troubleshoot it.

Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Wow, I don't think I realized just how many single-board computers I have
around the house until I wrote up this inventory. It's a good thing these
are low-power computers, or my electricity bill would be crazy! If 
any of you have a single-board computer sitting around but
you aren't sure what to do with it, I hope this article inspires you to
put it to work.
