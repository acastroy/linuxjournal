<h1 class="title">At the Forge: Introducing PyInstaller</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_8">Want to distribute Python programs to your Python-less clients?
PyInstaller is the answer. By Reuven M. Lerner</h2>

<p>
If you're used to working with a compiled language, the notion
that you would need to have a programming language around, not just for
development but also for running an application, seems a bit weird.
Just because a program was written in C doesn't mean you need a C
compiler in order to run it, right?
</p>

<p>
But of course, interpreted and byte-compiled languages do require
the original language, or a version of it, in order to run. True, Java
programs are compiled, but they're compiled into bytecodes then
executed by the JVM. Similarly, .NET programs cannot run unless the
CLR is present.
</p>

<p>
Even so, many of the students in my Python courses are surprised to
discover that if you want to run a Python program, you need to have
the Python language installed. If you're running Linux, this
isn't a problem. Python has come with every distribution I've used
since 1995. Sometimes the Python version isn't as modern as I'd like,
but the notion of "this computer can't run Python programs" isn't
something I've had to deal with very often.
</p>

<p>
However, not everyone runs Linux, and not everyone's computer has
Python on it. What can you do about that? More specifically, what
can you do when your clients don't have Python and aren't interested
in installing it? Or what if you just want to write and distribute an
application in Python, without bothering your users with additional
installation requirements?
</p>

<p>
In this article, I discuss <a href="https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io">PyInstaller</a>, a cross-platform tool that
lets you take a Python program and distribute it to your users,
such that they can treat it as a standalone app. I also discuss
what it doesn't do, because many people who think about using
PyInstaller don't fully understand what it does and doesn't
do.
</p>


<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Running Python Code</h3>

<p>
Like Java and .NET, Python programs are compiled into bytecodes, high-level commands that don't correspond to the instructions
of any actual computer, but that reference something known as a
"virtual machine". There are a number of substantial differences
between Java and Python though. Python doesn't have an explicit
compilation phase; its bytecodes are pretty high level and connected
to the Python language itself, and the compiler doesn't do that much
in terms of optimization. The correspondence between Python source
code and the resulting bytecodes is basically one-to-one; you won't find
the bytecode compiler doing fancy things like inlining code or
optimizing loops.
</p>

<p>
However, there's no doubt that Python runs bytecode, rather than your
source code. You can see this in a number of different ways, the
easiest of which is to create a Python module and then import that
module. The module is translated into Python bytecodes and then
saved to a file with a .pyc suffix. (In Python 3, this is under a directory
called __pycache__, with separate byte-compiled versions for
different Python versions and architectures.)
</p>

<p>
What does this all have to do with PyInstaller? Well, if you want to
distribute a Python program, it's not enough to provide the
byte-compiled output. You also need to provide a copy of Python, and that turns out to be a pain under certain circumstances, as I
mentioned previously.
</p>

<p>
PyInstaller takes your Python code and byte-compiles it. But, then it
also creates an executable application that basically loads Python and
runs your program. In other words, each application you distribute
with PyInstaller has a complete copy of Python within it, including
the libraries needed to run your program. Normally, Python includes
the entire standard library, but PyInstaller is smart enough to
include only those modules it really needs, thus keeping the
distribution size within reason.
</p>

<p>
Note that the copy of Python you have when using PyInstaller is used to
create the distributable package. This means if you are running
Python 3.4 on Linux, it's that copy of Python 3.4 for Linux
that'll be included in your package. In other words, PyInstaller
works across platforms, in that you can run it on Linux, Windows,
macOS and other systems, but the resulting package is specifically
for one architecture. It also means you need to be a bit careful
when using PyInstaller on a computer that has multiple Python versions
installed.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Installing PyInstaller</h3>

<p>
PyInstaller is most easily installed on a computer running Python with
the standard <code>pip</code> command:

</p>
<pre><code>
pip install -U --user pyinstaller
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The <code>-U</code> flag indicates that you would like to upgrade PyInstaller, in
case you already have installed it and the version on PyPI is newer.
The <code>--user</code> flag indicates that you don't want to install it in the
system's directories, but rather under your own home directory.
Recently, I've become a fan of installing things with <code>--user</code>, largely
because it avoids the need to think about permissions. However, it
does mean that you need to add the "bin" directory from the
<code>--user</code>
location to your <code>PATH</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you're on a computer that has more than one Python version
installed, it sometimes can be hard to know just which version is
connected to <code>pip</code>. (Although <code>pip --version</code> will tell you which
version of Python it's using.) For this reason, I sometimes do
things the long way, as follows:

</p>
<pre><code>
python3.6 -m pip install -U --user pyinstaller
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The <code>-m</code> flag is sort of like the <code>import</code> statement in Python;
running things in this way ensures that you're using the version you want.
</p>

<p>
Now that you've installed PyInstaller, let's use it to create a
distributable Python application. I've created a new program
called (very creatively) myapp.py. Here's the source code:

</p>
<pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/env python3.6

import sys

print("Hello, and welcome to my app!")

print(f"We're running Python {sys.version}")

for i in range(10):
    print(f"{i} ** 2 = {i**2}, {i} ** 3 = {i**3}")
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
As you can see, this program imports the <code>sys</code> module, which
provides
access to the Python environment, as well as its variables and settings. I
do this so that I can grab <code>sys.version</code> and ensure that the correct
version is really running.
</p>

<p>
Next, I execute a "for" loop, for no reason other than that it gives
me some output that I can see on the screen when the program runs.
</p>

<p>
In both cases, I use one of my favorite features from Python 3.6,
<code>f-strings</code>, which allows me to interpolate expressions inside curly
braces. This is, in my mind, far better than the previous ways this was done in Python, using the "%" operator on strings or (more
recently) the <code>str.format</code> method.
</p>

<p>
So, let's assume you want to run this program on a colleague's
machine. (Remember that your colleague needs to run the same operating
system as you do, because the output from PyInstaller is going to be a
binary based on the Python version you've installed.) You can type:

</p>
<pre><code>
pyinstaller myapp.py
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
And, you'll get a lot of output. I'm not going to review all of it, but here
are some highlights:

</p>
<pre><code>
468 INFO: PyInstaller: 3.3.1
468 INFO: Python: 3.6.3
470 INFO: Platform:
 â†ªLinux-4.4.0-119-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial
475 INFO: wrote /root/myapp1/myapp.spec
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The file "myapp.spec" describes the application you're creating
with PyInstaller. You'll find that this file is created
automatically when you run PyInstaller. Normally, PyInstaller is
smart enough to figure out what files must be included in the
resulting distribution, but in some cases, such as data files and
shared libraries, you might have to edit the specfile and add them
yourself:

</p>
<pre><code>
491 INFO: Extending PYTHONPATH with paths
['/root/myapp1', '/root/myapp1']
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
When you say <code>import xyz</code> in Python, the language looks (for starters)
in the current directory for "xyz.py". If it doesn't find that (or a
bytecoded variation), it looks through the elements of
<code>sys.path</code>,
one by one, looking for "xyz.py". If you want to tell Python to look
in some additional directories, you can set the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment
variable. Here, PyInstaller is saying that it's modifying
<code>PYTHONPATH</code> so that the program can find modules and packages defined
in the current directory:

</p>
<pre><code>
491 INFO: checking Analysis
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
PyInstaller analyzes your code in order to figure out which modules
and packages you want to use. Used modules are included in the final
distribution, while unused ones are ignored.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
The "dist" Directory</h3>

<p>
There's a lot more to the output, but after running PyInstaller,
you'll find that there's a "dist" directory, and that in that
directory is another subdirectory with the name of your new
application.
</p>

<p>
This directory contains your new Python application. Now, you can't
just run it like that; it's still a bit more complex than your average
executable. The idea is that you'll turn the directory into a
zipfile, distribute the software to wherever you need it, unzip it on
the destination machine, and then run the top-level program.
</p>

<p>
But what if you use a module that has not only a Python
component, but also a compiled C component? PyInstaller handles that
automatically. For example, say you're going to use NumPy in your program, how
does PyInstaller handle the C portion, which is compiled?
</p>

<p>
In this case, PyInstaller noticed that you were using a module with a C
component. And if you look in the "dist" directory, you'll now see a
bunch of additional shared libraries (*.so files).
</p>

<p>
PyInstaller can't promise to work with all complex packages, but the
authors have tried hard to provide a large degree of compatibility.
For example, if you use the Cython package (for implementing Python
modules in C or providing type hints), you'll find that
PyInstaller handles it fine, including the appropriate files in the
"dist" directory.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Conclusion</h3>

<p>
For years, many of my students and consulting clients have wanted to
distribute Python code without needing to run the language itself.
That's not possible, but PyInstaller does the next best thing, letting
you distribute software in a fairly straightforward way.
