Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS) provides an easy way to scale your Web
applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc99300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This might come as a surprise, given that I have spent much of my
professional career working with, writing on and teaching about
the use of databases, but there was a period (mostly during and right
after college) when I really didn't understand why people ever would
need them. After all, I thought, you can just store and retrieve
information in a file on your disk, no? My attitude back then
demonstrated not only profound ignorance about databases themselves,
but also about the types of problems people need to solve and
the ways in which database technology had, even then, been developed
to solve those problems.
</p><p>
Now I'm not quite as dismissive of technologies as I was back in my
college days. But, it's true that although I've long heard of &ldquo;message
queues&rdquo;, it's been only in the last year or so, while working on a project,
that I've come to realize just what a useful innovation they are.
Sure enough, now that I understand how and why I would want to use
them, I see uses for message queues everywhere.
</p><p>
In this article, I introduce the idea of message queues and give
several examples of how you can install and use them. I also
discuss why you might want to use a message queue, particularly on a
Web application, which people typically think of as consisting only of an
HTTP server and related software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc99510"></a>
Message Queues</h2></div></div><p>
If you've been programming for any period of time, you know that
a fundamental data structure is the queue, or FIFO (first in, first
out). Like a queue at the post office, the first item stored also
is the first item removed. Different queue implementations have
different capabilities, but the general idea is that you put something
in the queue and then retrieve it when it's ready. In Ruby (and many
other languages, such as Python), you can implement a queue as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Queue
  def initialize
    @queue = [ ]
  end

  def enqueue(thing)
    @queue &lt;&lt; thing
  end

  def dequeue
    @queue.shift
  end

  def to_s
    @queue.join(', ')
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
You then can use it as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt; require 'queue' #=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; q = Queue.new #=&gt;
&gt;&gt; q.enqueue('a') #=&gt; ["a"]
&gt;&gt; q.enqueue('b') #=&gt; ["a", "b"]
&gt;&gt; q.enqueue('c') #=&gt; ["a", "b", "c"]
&gt;&gt; q.dequeue #=&gt; "a"
</pre>
</p><p>
Because queues in Ruby can hold any value, you don't need to worry
about what will be on the queue. You just know that you can stick
whatever you want on there, and that eventually you can retrieve it, in
order.
</p><p>
(I should note that if you're actively programming in Ruby, I
hope you're not really using a queue class like this, but that you're
rather just using arrays, which support all the basic operations
you're likely to need to work with simple queue data structures.)
</p><p>
Queues are great, but I'm sure you can already imagine all sorts
of horrible scenarios if you were to use this simple one for something
important, such as a list of bank transfers to execute. My banker's
desk is full of piles of papers that she needs to handle, and she
(presumably) works through them from top to bottom, dealing with each
one in turn, but it would be pretty unforgivable for one or more of
those papers to get lost. And, although it's easy to say that Ruby arrays
are pretty stable, what happens if the power goes out? In such a
case, the entire queue is lost, causing untold problems for the people
who expected safe delivery.
</p><p>
The difference between the simple-minded queue I showed above
and a true message queue is that the latter guarantees delivery of
every message. This means that basically no matter what happens, you
can be sure the message eventually will be delivered, despite
power outages and other issues. But, message queues are even better
than that. Not only do they guarantee delivery, but they also work quickly,
allowing you to queue up a number of messages or actions that require
attention, but for which you lack the resources to handle
immediately.
</p><p>
For example, consider a Web application that is designed not to
provide immediate feedback to users, but rather to receive and process
information sent from other computers or mobile devices. This
type of application typically doesn't require giving the user
immediate feedback (other than an acknowledgement that data was
received). All of the messages sent are of great importance (and should not
be lost), but the number of messages can vary greatly from minute to
minute, let alone from hour to hour. When the data is processed and
eventually placed in the database, however, doesn't matter nearly as much.
</p><p>
There are more mundane examples, as well. Consider a Web application
that needs to send e-mail updates to people, such as from a
calendaring application. If the application were to send e-mail each
and every time an event were changed, the response time&mdash;or the
number of server processes available to receive new incoming
messages&mdash;might well suffer. Instead, the application can stick the
mail-sending task on a message queue and then let a process on a
separate computer retrieve the order and send the actual e-mail.
</p><p>
Offloading the retrieval of messages to a separate computer offers
another performance advantage. It allows you to scale up the
processing as necessary, by adding additional back-end computers.
Given that a message queue is transactional (that is, all-or-nothing),
you can have as many back-end machines retrieving from the queue as
you want. You don't have to worry that the same message will be
delivered twice or that two processes will have to fight over the
retrieved data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc99a38"></a>
Amazon SQS</h2></div></div><p>
So, now that I've convinced you that you want to have a message queue,
how do you go about using one? The first question is which one to
choose. Many message queues exist, and each has its
advantages and disadvantages. I've been using Amazon's Simple Queue
Service on a project for the past number of months, and although it
certainly has its downsides&mdash;it costs money, and it can take a bit
of time for messages to percolate through the system&mdash;the advantages
have been fairly clear, including Amazon's willingness to store
messages for up to two weeks and its impressive uptime statistics.
And, although I certainly could have set up my own message-queueing
system, I've been working on other aspects of the project and
appreciated that someone else, out there in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;, was dealing
with the various IT-related tasks associated with running a queue.
</p><p>
If you have used any of Amazon's previous cloud offerings, its
queue service will not be a surprise. You need to have an Amazon
account and sign up for a unique access key that will identify you to
Amazon for identification and billing purposes. In addition to the
access key, which you can think of as a user name, you also need a
secret (akin to a password), which is sent to Amazon along with each
request.
</p><p>
Once you have set yourself up with SQS, you need to connect to
it, preferably (but not necessarily) using one of the many SQS client
libraries that have been developed. Most of my work nowadays is in
Ruby, and when I started my project, I found that the best-known Ruby
gem for SQS access was from RightScale, in the &ldquo;right_aws&rdquo; package.
I have been using this driver without any problems, but it's true that
Amazon has since released its own drivers for Ruby. I hope to
experiment with that driver in the near future and to compare it with
the RightAws modules&mdash;although to be honest, I don't expect to see
any significant differences.
</p><p>
If you're using another language, there almost certainly
are libraries you can use as well. For the Python community, there
are the boto packages. See Resources for more
information.
</p><p>
By the way, it's true that SQS costs money. However, queueing systems
exist to handle large quantities of data, which means they're
going to charge you very little per message. How little? Well,
according to the prices posted at the time of this writing, sending messages is
absolutely free. Receiving messages is free for the first GB each
month. After that, you pay nothing for the first GB, and then 12 US
cents for each GB, up to 1TB. Now, Amazon does have a number of
different server centers, and each might have its own pricing. Also,
pricing is applicable only when going in or out of Amazon's server
systems. This means if you're using a hosting solution, such as
Heroku, which sits on Amazon servers, transfer to and from SQS is
completely free. Actually, that isn't quite true&mdash;data transfers are
free only if you stay within the same geographic server cluster. My
point, however, is that for most people and projects, the pricing
should not be an issue.
</p><p>
I'm using SQS for a Web application that is (by the time you read
this, if all goes well) intended to receive JSON data from mobile
devices, sent via an HTTP POST request. The JSON data then needs to
be parsed and stuck into a relational database, but that
doesn't need to happen right away. The architecture of the
application, thus, consists of two separate parts. The main Web app
receives the data and puts it onto the message queue with minimal
parsing and validation. A separate Web app, running on a separate
server, retrieves the JSON data, parses and validates it, and then
puts it into the database. From the perspective of SQS, the fact that
I'm using different servers really doesn't matter at all; as long as I
connect to SQS with the right user name and password, and use the right
queue name for sending and receiving, everything will be just fine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc99da8"></a>
Connecting to SQS</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can send to or receive from SQS, you first must connect to
it. Since I'm using the right_aws gem for Ruby, I need to download
and install that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gem install right_aws
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that because I'm using rvm, the Ruby version manager, I installed
this gem as my own user. If I were installing it for the entire
system, or if I were not using RVM, I would need to log in as
root or use sudo to execute the command as root.
</p><p>
With the right_aws gem installed and in place, I now can use it to
connect to the SQS server. Note that RightScale's gem provides access
to several different APIs, including several different
&ldquo;generations&rdquo;
of SQS. I am using the second-generation API, via the
RightAws::SqsGen2 class.
</p><p>
I've put my Amazon keys in a separate YAML-formatted configuration
file, allowing me to change and update keys as necessary, as well as
keep track of separate keys for different environments. I then read
the configuration information into my program with the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SQS_CONFIG = YAML.load_file("/Users/reuven/
&#8618;Desktop/config.yml")['defaults']
</pre>
</p><p>
The above takes each of the name-value pairs in the &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; section
of my config.yml file and puts it into a hash named SQS_CONFIG.
(Note that I've used all caps to indicate that this is a constant and
should not be modified by other programmers unless they have a
really, really good reason for doing so.)
</p><p>
I then can get a connection to SQS with the following code:


<pre     class="programlisting">
require 'right_aws'
sqs = RightAws::SqsGen2.new(SQS_CONFIG['aws_access_key_id'],
                            SQS_CONFIG['aws_secret_access_key'],
                            { :server =&gt; SQS_CONFIG['sqs_server'] }
                            )
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see from the above call,
<tt  >Right::SqsGen2.new</tt> takes three
parameters: the AWS key, the AWS secret and a hash of options that
help configure the queue object. The most important one to pass is
the name of the SQS server you want to use. If you don't specify it,
you'll get queue.amazonaws.com, but to be honest, I haven't
really thought about it much since checking with Heroku (our hosting
provider) about which server to use.
</p><p>
Once you're connected to SQS, you must create (or retrieve) a queue.
You can think of a queue as a single array to which you can store or
retrieve data, just as I did in my simple Queue class earlier in this
article. The difference, of course, is that the actual data storage
is happening across the network, on servers to which you have no
direct access. You can have any number of queues, each with its own
name, containing alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores.
So, if you want to use a queue called &ldquo;testq&rdquo;, just say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sqs_queue = sqs.queue('testq')
</pre>
</p><p>
This returns an instance of RightAws::SqsGen2::Queue, an object that
represents an Amazon message queue. A number of methods are defined on
this object, including creation (which I do via the above call, rather
than directly), deletion (which will remove all of your data, so I
really wouldn't suggest it unless you have to), and the sending and
receiving of messages. You also can set the visibility timeout on
this object, which tells Amazon how long a message should be invisible
once it has been read, but before it has been deleted. You even
can get the size of the message queue, using the
<tt  >size</tt> method.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc9a4e0"></a>
Sending Messages</h2></div></div><p>
In my simple, non-distributed message queue example, you saw that new
messages are added to the queue using an <tt  >enqueue</tt> method, taking a
single object as a parameter. The same is true in this case; if you
want to send a message to the queue, you simply say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my_message = 'hello!'
sqs_queue.send_message(my_message)
</pre>
</p><p>
This will turn your string into an SQS message and send it to the
queue. So long as the message is less than 64KB in size and is in
text format (including JSON or XML), Amazon probably will accept it.
(The RightScale gem claims to support messages only up to 8KB in
size, just as Amazon used to do, but it's not clear to me whether the
gem enforces these limits or if Amazon's updates are reflected by the
gem's behavior.) Trying to send a message that's too long for
Amazon's limits will result in an exception being thrown. There is an
explicit list on the SQS FAQ page of which UTF-8 characters are
acceptable in an SQS message.
</p><p>
One nice thing about SQS is that you can have any number of messages
in a queue at a time; there is no defined limit. By default, messages
are kept in a queue for four days, but you can configure that to be
anywhere from one hour to two weeks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc9a7a0"></a>
Receiving Messages</h2></div></div><p>
So, you've sent a message to the message queue. How do you receive it?
After going through the initial configuration, connection and queue
creation/opening displayed above, you can retrieve the first
waiting message on the queue with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
message = mothra_queue.receive
</pre>
</p><p>
In RightScale's Ruby library, <tt  >message</tt> is set to nil if no messages
were available. Thus, before you can operate on the message, you must
first check to ensure that it's non-nil.
</p><p>
Assuming that <tt  >message</tt> is not nil, you can get contents by transforming
the message into a string&mdash;in other words, by invoking
<tt  >.to_s</tt> on the
message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
print message.to_s
</pre>
</p><p>
When you retrieve a message, Amazon keeps a note of that and makes it
invisible to other processes that might try to retrieve it. In other
words, if you've queued a single message and then retrieve that
message, other processes trying to retrieve from the queue will be
told that no messages are available. However, this is true only for a
short time. Once the visibility timeout has passed, the message is
once again available to retrieving processes. So, in order to ensure that
a message is not read twice, it must be deleted:

<pre     class="programlisting">
message.delete
</pre>
</p><p>
Under most circumstances, you will want to retrieve and then
delete a message almost right away.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba1580.0xc9ac18"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you're saying, &ldquo;Well, that seems quite simple&rdquo;, you're
right.
Message queues are a dead-simple idea, particularly if you're
familiar with queues as data structures. Distributed message queues
can be quite difficult to get to work in a distributed and persistent
way, but Amazon has done just that and makes its queue available
for a very reasonable price, often ending up free for small
organizations and sites.
</p><p>
The advantages that a distributed message queue can bring to the table
are overwhelming though, particularly when you have tasks or pieces
of data that are coming in too rapidly to handle, but which could be
processed by a large number of back ends. It's easy to imagine a
large number of back-end computers picking messages off and inserting
them into a database, after parsing and checking them for validity.
Indeed, that's what I'm doing on my current project, and it has been
working like a charm.
</p><p>
Now, there are issues with Amazon's queues. For starters, they have
longer latency than you would get with a local queue, and they 
also are sitting on third-party servers, which might not sit well with
some companies. But for the most part, it has worked without a hitch
and has become a core part of the infrastructure on my project. During
the course of this work, I've started to find all sorts of uses for
message queues, and I'm starting to incorporate them into other
projects on which I work. The day may come when it's an exceptional
project that doesn't use a message queue, rather than the other way
around.

The home page for Amazon's SQS is <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sqs" target="_self">aws.amazon.com/sqs</a>. This
site, like all the other Amazon Web Services sites, has extensive
documentation, tutorials and examples, as well as forums that let
developers help one another. I've never needed to use the help, because
the documentation always has been sufficient for my needs, but I've
 read through the forums on some occasions and have been impressed with
the degree of both community involvement and official answers from Amazon's
staff.
