Fluendo's Codec Pack</h2></div></div><p>
Fluendo, the folks whose mission is to make everything to run on Linux, recently announced Codec Pack Release 15. In addition to the existing
Windows Media, MPEG, DivX and other decoders, the new version 15 now offers
support for AMD GPUs through the XvBA using OpenGL for efficient video
rendering. This new addition follows on the heels of recently added support
for VDPAU (NVIDIA) and VAAPI (Intel). Fluendo says its products are
utilized by most OEMs for devices like desktops, laptops, thin clients,
tablets, digital signage, set-top boxes, connected TV and media centers.
Also, Fluendo solutions have been used by companies who've adopted Linux
internally, allowing them to provide their employees with complete
multimedia capabilities while remaining in full compliance with laws and
patents.

Anderson and Mutch's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Preventing Good People From Doing Bad
Things</em></span>
(Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Good fences make good neighbors&rdquo; is the old adage behind Brian
Anderson and John Mutch's new security book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Preventing Good People From
Doing Bad Things: Implementing Least Privilege</em></span>. Many corporations have had
to learn the hard way that they can have the slickest security software
money can buy, while the greatest threats lurk from within. The
main focus of the book, published by Apress, is to show how firms can
remove these internal weaknesses by applying the concept of least
privilege. The authors point out the implications of allowing users to run
with unlimited administrator rights and discuss the implications when using
Microsoft's Group Policy, UNIX and Linux servers, databases and other
apps. Other topics include virtual environments, compliance and a
cost-benefit analysis of least privilege. Auditors, geeks and suits will
all find useful information in this book.

McGuire and O'Leary's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Book: A Futurist's Manifesto</em></span> (O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s own complete migration from the Gutenberg realm to the
digital one is a fine case study on the powerful trends in publishing that
are explored in a novel new project titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Book: A Futurist's
Manifesto</em></span>
by Hugh McGuire and Brian O'Leary. The core content of this O'Reilly project
is a collection of essays from thought leaders and practitioners on the
developments occurring in the wake of the digital publishing shake-up
brought on by the Kindle, iPhone and their kindred devices. The essays
explore the new tools that are rapidly transforming how content is created,
managed and distributed; the critical role that metadata plays in making
book content discoverable in an era of abundance; the publishing projects
that are at the bleeding edge of this digital revolution and how some
digital books can evolve moment to moment, based on reader feedback. This
particular project will do just that, incorporating reader feedback as the
book is produced in hybrid digital-print format and determining in what
ways the project will develop.

Queplix's QueCloud FREEMIUM Version</h2></div></div><p>
Queplix recently announced the availability of the FREEMIUM version of
QueCloud, a product which the company bills as &ldquo;the first data
management cloud [that] enables companies to securely integrate cloud
applications such as Netsuite, Google and SAP with unprecedented speed and
simplicity&rdquo;. The benefits, says QueCloud, include an 80%+ TOC reduction
vs. traditional ETL data management tools. QueCloud's core technology is
Queplix's flagship Virtual Data Manager architecture, which enables the
configuration of a series of intelligent application software blades that
identify and extract key data and associated security information from many
different target applications. The blades identify and extract key metadata
and associated security information from the data stored within these
applications, then bring it into the Queplix Engine to support data
integration with other applications. The FREEMIUM version provides free
access to users, developers and independent software vendors.

Arkeia's Backup Appliances</h2></div></div><p>
The new third generation of Arkeia Backup Appliances promises to
&ldquo;reduce costs with larger disk capacities, embedded SSD, and
deduplication&rdquo; says the well-known provider of backup and disaster
recovery products. Deduplication delivers effective storage that is many
times the capacity of internal drives. The company also touts new features,
such as RAID-6, faster network connectivity, fully integrated and optimized
Arkeia Network Backup v9 software, integrated bare-metal disaster recovery
and support for VMware vSphere virtual environments. Target customers for
the appliances are mid-sized companies or remote offices.

OpenStack Diablo</h2></div></div><p>
The new Diablo (4th) release of the OpenStack cloud-computing platform
recently went live, containing enhancements across the three existing
projects: OpenStack Compute, Object Storage and Image Service. Key new
features include new networking capabilities, such as &ldquo;networking as a
service&rdquo; and unified authentication across all projects. Diablo extends
existing API support and accelerates networking and scalability features,
allowing enterprises and service providers to deploy and manage OpenStack
clouds with larger performance standards and with ease. Two new projects
for the next OpenStack software release, &ldquo;Essex&rdquo;, have been initiated,
currently code-named Quantum and Keystone.

eyeOS Professional Edition</h2></div></div><p>
eyeOS bills itself as &ldquo;the most-advanced Web desktop in the world and
the largest open-source software project in Spain&rdquo;. The new eyeOS
Professional Edition takes the original edition to a new level, enabling
private clouds that are accessible via any browser or device. All
employees' and customers' workspaces can be virtualized in the cloud. The
company says that the solution is highly scalable, easy to manage, does not
require a large investment and includes all types of applications,
including virtualized ones. Because eyeOS is developed in PHP and
JavaScript and compiled in Hip-Hop, the system is not only
high-performance, but also no software needs to be installed on the computer in
order to work with it. Furthermore, the company says that eyeOS can
integrate existing SaaS, virtualized legacy applications and other
in-house apps served up as Web services.

GrammaTech's CodeSonar</h2></div></div><p>
Kill programming bugs dead with
CodeSonar,
GrammaTech's static-analysis tool that performs a whole-program,
interprocedural analysis on code and identifies complex programming bugs.
The breakthrough feature in this release relates to the new
program-analysis algorithms that identify data races and other serious
concurrency defects. The process involves symbolic execution techniques to
reason about many possible execution paths and interleavings
simultaneously. The concurrency analysis can be applied to multithreaded
software written for both single core and multicore architectures. Another
new feature, code-level metrics, is built on CodeSonar's existing
code-analysis and reporting framework, which enables project managers to
track popular metrics, such as cyclomatic complexity, or even define new
metrics. Warnings can be generated automatically when metrics are outside
an expected range. CodeSonar runs on Linux, Windows, Solaris and Mac OS
and supports most compilers.
