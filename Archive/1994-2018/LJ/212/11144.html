Mercurial provides a
git-like repository with the flexibility of a plugin architecture.

A short while ago, an article appeared in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> implying 
Git was the be-all and end-all of source code revision control systems
(&ldquo;Git&mdash;Revision Control Perfected&rdquo; by Henry Van Styn, August 2011). I would like to
challenge that assumption and declare to the world that the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> perfect
version control system is here, and its name is Mercurial.
</p><p>
In case you didn't notice it, my tongue was firmly in my cheek in that last
paragraph. I think version control systems are like editors. They are
all different and fit people and their work habits differently. There
is no one perfect system to rule them all. Git may be the perfect fit for
some people, and RCS may fit
someone else better. This article describes another option to add to the
mix. Mercurial provides some of the features of systems like Git, and some
of the features of systems like CVS or Subversion. Hopefully, after reading
this article,
you'll have enough information to make a rational choice as
to what is best for you. 
</p><p>
The main Mercurial site contains lots of documentation for
end users and developers alike. Several tutorials are available,
and they even include a series of work flows that cover how end users
can use Mercurial for their development projects. Using those, you can
see how you could use Mercurial as a solo developer or as one of a group
of developers, or how to work with a central repository like CVS. These
work flows are great starting points for you to create your own.
</p><p>
First, let's look at what makes up Mercurial. A Mercurial repository
consists of a working directory, which is paired with a store. The
store contains the history of the repository. Every working
directory is paired with its own copy of the store. This means that
Mercurial has a distributed system, much like Git. When you commit a
series of file changes, a single changeset is created, encapsulating
these changes. Each changeset gets a sequential number, called the
revision number. But, remember that each working directory gets its own
copy of the store, so these revision numbers may not actually match
up. For this reason, each revision also gets a 40-digit hexadecimal
globally unique ID.

Figure 2. Right-clicking a file and pulling up the properties
gives you lots of Mercurial information.
</p></div></div><p>
So, what happens when two users are doing parallel
development? Assuming they are starting with equal repositories,
any committed changes by user one creates a new branch, and any
committed changes by user two also creates a new branch. User one then
pulls in any changes from user two's repository. This creates two branches
in user one's repository: one branch for user one's changes and one branch for
user two's changes. User one then needs to merge these two branches together in
order to incorporate all the changes since the last synchronization of
repositories. User two would need to do the same thing (pull and merge)
in order to synchronize the repositories. Changes also can be pushed to
another repository. 
</p><p>
One of Mercurial's strengths is
its use of extensions. Several extensions are available from the
project, and you always can go ahead and write your own. Extensions
are written in Python, so hone your scripting skills. You can enable these
extensions by adding them to the
<tt  >[extensions]</tt> section of
your configuration file.
</p><p>
So, how do you actually use Mercurial? You probably will want to set some
basic configuration options in the .hgrc file. Mercurial needs a user
name for recording commits. You can set this option in the configuration
file with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

[ui]
username = John Doe &lt;john.doe@company.com&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing to do is to create your local repository. If you are
working off a copy from someone else, you would make a clone. The
format of the clone command is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hg clone [OPTIONS...] SOURCE [DEST]
</pre>
</p><p>
The source option can take several different forms. If the repository you
are cloning is on the same machine, you simply can provide the filesystem
path to the source repository. Mercurial includes a Web server that can
be used to provide access to a repository over HTTP. If you are cloning
such a repository, the command simply would be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
hg clone http://[user[:pass]@]somemachine.com[:port]/[path][#revision]
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can do this over HTTPS. At my work, we keep backup copies of
repositories on a machine that is accessible only over SSH. And, that's fine,
because Mercurial is perfectly happy cloning over SSH. You can use the
following to do so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hg clone ssh://user@host[:port]/[path][#revision]
</pre>
</p><p>
You need to have a valid login on the remote machine, of course. The
path is relative to your home directory, so if you want to use a full
path, you need to start it with two forward slashes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hg clone ssh://user@host//full/path/to/repo
</pre>
</p><p>
Creating a new repository is even easier. All you need to do is create
a directory to house all of the files going into your repository. Then,
you can <tt  >cd</tt> to that directory and execute the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hg init
</pre>
</p><p>
This command creates a subdirectory named .hg, containing all of
the store files for your new repository.
</p><p>
Changing your repository's contents is done through the
<tt  >add</tt> and
<tt  >remove</tt> commands. There also is a
<tt  >rename</tt> command you can use
to change the name of a file within your repository. You can use that command 
to move files around within your repository as well. Let's say you
want to move a file to subdirectory dir1. You would execute this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hg rename file1.c dir1
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get the current state of a file with the
<tt  >status</tt> command. This
will tell you whether a file has been modified, added, removed and so on. The
<tt  >diff</tt> command shows the differences in a file from the current
version and the last committed version. If you decide to toss
away all of these changes, you can use the <tt  >revert</tt> command to reset the
file to the last committed version. Once you are happy with your edits,
you can commit any changes with the <tt  >commit</tt> command.
</p><p>
At the level of the repository as a whole, a lot of commands are
available. When you have done a lot of editing and committed all your
changes to your local copy of the repository, you can send the changes out
to another repository with the <tt  >push</tt> command. The destination for the
<tt  >push</tt> command can have any of the forms shown above
in 
the clone command examples. 
If the changes of interest were made by another user
at a remote repository, you can use the <tt  >pull</tt> command to grab them and
put them into your local repository. 
</p><p>
You may want to check what is going
to happen before merging these changes. Before pushing changes out, you
can use the <tt  >outgoing</tt> command to see what changesets would have been
sent had you actually issued a <tt  >push</tt> command. For pulls, you can use
the <tt  >incoming</tt> command to see what changesets would be brought in had
you issued a <tt  >pull</tt> command. Once this is done, these changes sit in a
separate branch. You then need to merge this branch back in to the main
one in order to incorporate the changes. 
</p><p>
But, what if you don't really
have any kind of direct access over the network? You can use the
<tt  >bundle</tt>
command to generate a compressed file containing the changeset. This
can then be transferred, either by e-mail or SneakerNet, to the remote
repository. Once it is there, you can use the
<tt  >unbundle</tt> command to
import the changeset into the remote repository. Again, you can use the
<tt  >incoming</tt> and <tt  >outgoing</tt>
commands, with the <tt  >--bundle filename</tt> option,
to check out the changesets and see what they will do before actually
running the real commands.
</p><p>
As I mentioned earlier, Mercurial includes a Web server that can provide
access to your repository over HTTP. It is not appropriate to provide
public full-time access to a repository, because it doesn't provide any
type of user authentication. In those cases, you would use a real Web
server, like Apache, to serve up the repository. But, if you simply want
to throw up the server for quick temporary access, or if you are just
offering up access internally on a local network and don't need to worry
too much about security, this gives you really quick access. You simply
need to run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hg serve [OPTIONS...]
</pre>
</p><p>
Some of the more common options include <tt  >-d</tt> or
<tt  >--daemon</tt>. This drops
the Mercurial Web server into the background. 
</p><p>
You may want to set the
port that it is listening on with the option <tt  >-p</tt> or
<tt  >--port</tt>. The
default port is 8000. You can push and pull from such a Web server. If
you want to serve over HTTPS rather than HTTP, you can use the option
<tt  >--certificate</tt> to set the SSL certificate file to use.
</p><p>
Several clients available for working with Mercurial
repositories. For GNOME users, there is a handy one called
tortoise. The
really great part of this client is that it integrates nicely with
Nautilus. This means you can interact with your repository, commit
changes, clone it, synchronize it with a remote repository and much
more. You also get informational icons within Nautilus, letting you see
immediately which files are outdated, changed or whatever their
status may be. All of the tools are simply a right-click away. 
Some great standalone clients also are available, so look around and see
what you like. 
</p><p>
Hopefully, this introduction gives you some ideas on what
you can get done with Mercurial. Now you don't have any excuses for not
putting your source code under version control.
