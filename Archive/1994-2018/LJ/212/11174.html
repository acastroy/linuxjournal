See how your favorites fared in this year's vote.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e92a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The votes are in, the tallies are counted, the hanging chads have been
evaluated, and we have our winners. This year holds a few surprises,
a couple dominant players and as much open source as you can handle. We
don't encourage gambling here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but if you had an office
pool going for pizza money, it's officially too late to make your wager.

Best Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Debian</em></span>
</p><p>
apt, apt and more apt this year in the distribution category. Although it's
no surprise that Ubuntu remains king of the distros, it's nice to see Debian,
the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of Ubuntu gaining some ground. Whether it's because Linux
Mint is making Debian more user-friendly or because folks are drawn to
the appeal of Debian's stability, it got just about half the votes of
all the Ubuntu variants combined. Way to go Debian! Oh, and of course,
congratulations to the winner and still-champion, Ubuntu.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9778"></a>
Best Distribution for Netbooks/Limited Hardware</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Ubuntu Netbook Remix</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Android and Debian (tie)</em></span>
</p><p>
Although Ubuntu is streamlining its versions and making the desktop
screen function similarly to the Netbook screen, Ubuntu Netbook Remix still garnered the
most votes this year. Will the push to Unity make next year's Readers'
Choice look a little different? Time will tell. Our runner-up last year
was Android, and this year, Android is still our runner-up, but it shares
the silver medal with Debian. Why is Debian getting so much attention
this year? For the same reason soda-pop companies are releasing
&ldquo;throw-back&rdquo;
versions of their drinks with real sugar, sometimes the tried-and-true
operating systems just taste a little sweeter.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9a38"></a>
Best Mobile OS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Android</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: MeeGo</em></span>
</p><p>
With the death of Maemo, the abandonment of MeeGo and the discontinuation
of webOS, the obvious winner this year is Android with 80% of the
vote. MeeGo takes enough of the remaining vote to get our runner-up spot, but it's a bitter prize, as MeeGo's future looks pretty
bleak. Will Android get another open-source competitor? Will the lack
of open competition stifle Android innovation? Only time will tell. For
current Linux-based handsets, however, Google's Android truly can say,
&ldquo;All your base are belong to us.&rdquo;

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9d50"></a>
Best Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GNOME</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: KDE</em></span>
</p><p>
Last year it was a tie. This year, our back-and-forth battle falls to
GNOME as the best desktop environment. Due to the timing of the GNOME
3 release, it's hard to tell if the victory is because of version 3
or in spite of it. Nonetheless, GNOME ekes a victory with a 3%-margin
over KDE. The next-closest desktop environment is XFCE with less than
one-third the votes of either of the big two. With such big contenders for
first and second, however, that third-place spot is significant, and XFCE is
gaining ground. We think it's one to keep an eye on next year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e9fb8"></a>
Best Web Browser</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Firefox</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Chrome/Chromium</em></span>
</p><p>
After its huge popularity spike last year, we thought the race for best
browser would be neck and neck this year. The Firefox team stepped up
its game, however, and this year made several major revisions. Although
Chrome/Chromium is a major contender and even gained a few
percentage points, Firefox still dominates with more than twice as
many votes. As a Firefox user myself, it doesn't surprise me to see my
favorite fiery fox on top, but it's hard to argue with Chrome/Chromium's
lightning-fast response time. As more and more extensions are being ported
to Google's browser, Firefox has some real competition. Hopefully, that
competition will inspire greatness from both teams. As users, we can
only benefit!

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27ea278"></a>
Best E-mail Client</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Thunderbird</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Gmail Web Client</em></span>
</p><p>
Like its foxy-browser sibling, Thunderbird takes top spot again this
year in the e-mail category. Now that Canonical has adopted Thunderbird as
its default e-mail client in Ubuntu, we see the popularity rising
for our blue-birdie friend. Still hanging on tightly to second place is
Gmail. Is Gmail an app? We're not sure, but it certainly does get votes as the
best e-mail client. Because Thunderbird can access Gmail servers easily,
it's possible this category blurs the line a bit, as users simply can 
use both. When it comes to picking a favorite though, Thunderbird is
the clear victor with more than twice as many votes as our runner-up.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27ea538"></a>
Best IM Client</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Pidgin</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Skype</em></span>
</p><p>
The results are similar, but the trend obviously is shifting in our Best
IM Client category. Pidgin takes the number-one spot with a full half
of your votes, while Skype barely squeaks out a second place win with
15%. Although its video chat is hard to beat, we think Skype lost some
points due to its purchase by Microsoft. What does that new ownership
mean for the future of Skype? No one knows for sure, but it has Linux
users scrambling to find alternative video chat clients &ldquo;just in
case&rdquo;.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27ea850"></a>
Best IRC Client</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Pidgin</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: X-Chat</em></span>
</p><p>
For years I've been touting the awesome IRC features Pidgin boasts. It's
nice to see Pidgin take first place again as favorite IRC
app. As my geek-fu has matured, so has my chatting preference, however,
and I skipped right over our second-place IRC client X-Chat. I'm now
using IRSSI for my textual communication needs. Although my preferences
seldom represent those of the masses, I'll be shaking my IRSSI
pom-poms next year for the awesome underdog. Credit where credit is due,
however; it's hard to beat the flexibility of Pidgin and the huge feature
set of X-Chat. It's clear why they are the Readers' Choice victors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27eaab8"></a>
Best Microblogging Client</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Gwibber</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Choqok</em></span>
</p><p>
Our top-two microblogging clients from last year retain their status as
class favorites. Gwibber and Choqok, GNOME- and KDE-native, respectively,
garnered the most votes again this year. The ever-popular Air application
Tweetdeck is right on their heels, however, and it's throwing in its
cross-platform flexibility to make the contest interesting. Native clients
(with odd names) still hold favor among readers, but those fancy Adobe
Air and HTML5 alternatives slowly are gaining ground. Who will win next
year? We'll be sure to tweet the answer when the time comes.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e1608"></a>
Best Office Suite</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LibreOffice</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: OpenOffice.org</em></span>
</p><p>
The king has been dethroned! Well, sorta. Yes, technically the newcomer
LibreOffice stomped on the former-champion OpenOffice.org. Because LibreOffice
is a fork of OpenOffice.org, however, it seems like we should have an
asterisk in there somewhere. Shortly after Oracle bought Sun Microsystems,
OpenOffice.org was forked. The good news for users is that LibreOffice has
a large dev crew, and updates and feature enhancements are coming out
at a really nice rate. The king is dead; long live the king!

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e18c8"></a>
Best Single Office Program</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>OOWriter</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: AbiWord</em></span>
</p><p>
We're not entirely clear if OOWriter is referring to the
OpenOffice.org version or the LibreOffice version of the word-processing
program. Basically, we're considering the winner, &ldquo;the program that
saves to .ODT by default&rdquo;, and we think that covers it. The runner-up again
this year is not a member of the LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org suite, but rather the
standalone AbiWord word processor. In fact, AbiWord is what this article
is being typed on as we speak. Will the LibreOffice takeover change
the favorite app category in the future? Based on voting this year,
we guess not. It's nice to see our underdog-favorite AbiWord continue to
get votes though.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e1b88"></a>
Best Digital Photo Management Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
digiKam</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Picasa</em></span>
</p><p>
The past few years have been an epic battle between these two
programs. This year, we think the contestants might be a little tired,
because although they still are clearly the top-two choices, their popularity
pretty much has leveled off. digiKam ekes out a victory by less than two percentage points, which means it's hard to go wrong when you pick one of
these two. Whichever you choose, it's bound to be better than my solution:
shoebox full of photos.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e1e48"></a>
Best Graphics Design Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
GIMP</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Inkscape</em></span>
</p><p>
GIMP kicks butt and takes names, as it scores two-thirds of the total votes
this year. Inkscape remains in second place, but it's a very distant
second. There certainly are other options available, but time and time
again, we turn to GIMP for editing those photos. Although the learning
curve for GIMP can be a bit steep, the same often is said for Linux
itself. And like Linux, the reward is great.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e2108"></a>
Best Audio Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Audacity</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Ardour</em></span>
</p><p>
When I saw the Best Audio Tool category, my first instinct was to vote for
speakers. I'm clearly in the minority, however, as 85% of you instantly
thought of Audacity. Ardour is down another couple percentage points this
year, but we still gave it runner-up status. We don't want Audacity to
get too prideful after all.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e23c8"></a>
Best Audio Player</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Amarok</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: VLC</em></span>
</p><p>
It's still clear readers love Amarok. In a surprisingly close second
place this year is VLC. Although not normally thought of as an audio player,
it does the job well enough to get just 7% fewer votes than Amarok. And
last year's runner-up Rhythmbox? Sadly, it's far in the distance behind
these two front-runners.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e2688"></a>
Best Media Player</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
VLC</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: MPlayer</em></span>
</p><p>
Seeing VLC take runner-up in the audio player category makes this
victory a no-brainer. VLC plays just about any sort of video you throw
at it. I think if you shove a paper flip book into your floppy drive,
VLC will animate it on-screen for you. VLC takes such a huge margin this
year, we almost didn't include MPlayer as a runner-up. VLC is the
favorite, without question. (Note: we don't actually recommend shoving
a paper flip book into your floppy drive.)

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e2948"></a>
Best Bookmark Sync Tool</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Firefox Sync</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Chrome Bookmarks</em></span>
</p><p>
Our bookmark sync category completely rewrote history and gave us two
brand-new winners. Firefox Sync, now built in to the browser, takes the victory
handily with twice the votes of the runner-up, Chrome Bookmarks. This
split makes absolute sense, because Firefox beat Chrome in the browser war
by the same margin. In fact, if these numbers were different, it would
cause our highly scientific voting process to look suspect. As it is,
for Firefox users, we recommend Firefox Sync, and for Chrome users, we
recommend Chrome Bookmarks. Feel free to call me Captain Obvious.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e2c08"></a>
Best On-line Collaboration Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Google Docs</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Wikis</em></span>
</p><p>
We didn't title this &ldquo;Most Popular Collaboration Tool&rdquo;, because as
painful as it is, the majority of on-line collaboration tends to be
e-mail messages with subjects like &ldquo;RE:Fwd:Fwd:Re: This one Re: Final
FWD: Final2&rdquo;
and ugly multi-fonted .doc files. Although popular, that's definitely not
ideal. Google Docs takes the spoils of war again this year with its
ever-improving feature set for on-line collaboration. It's even possible to
watch as someone else edits a document. For everything else, wikis are
still popular. Easy to edit and easy to maintain, wikis are a godsend
for living documents.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e2f78"></a>
Best Cloud-Based File Storage</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Dropbox</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Ubuntu One</em></span>
</p><p>
When it comes to cloud storage, it's hard to beat Dropbox. Although
security is an often-touted concern with the cloud-storage behemoth,
ease of use trumps those concerns. Ubuntu One is a distant second to
the cross-platform, simple-to-use Dropbox. I'd put my Dropbox referral
code here to get some free space, but I suspect our editor would frown
on such a thing, plus you'd all likely flog me.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e3238"></a>
Best Kid-Friendly Application</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tux Paint</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: GCompris</em></span>
</p><p>
Bill Kendrick's Tux Paint continues as the crowd favorite for
2011. Whether you're a kid of 5 or 50, it's hard not to smile when
creating paintings with Bill's user-friendly application. GCompris is
no slouch in the kid-friendly category either and quite nicely takes
second place with its educational focus and lively graphics.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x27e34f8"></a>
Best Game</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>World of Goo</em></span></b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: <span class="emphasis"><em>Battle for Wesnoth</em></span></em></span>
</p><p>
For the first time in the history of histories, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></span> is not
the most popular game! In fact, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span> didn't even take second
this year, as it lost to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle for Wesnoth</em></span> by half of a percentage
point. (Normally we'd consider that a tie, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle for
Wesnoth</em></span> deserves
recognition for bumping off the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bubble</em></span>.)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>World of Goo</em></span> is a game similar
in addictiveness to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frozen Bubble</em></span>, but with better graphics and more
modern gameplay. If you're a casual gamer, check out <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Goo</em></span>,
it's really Goo-ood.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af70c8"></a>
Best Monitoring Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nagios</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: OpenNMS</em></span>
</p><p>
I misspelled &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; as I was typing this section, and
AbiWord's
recommendation for correction was &ldquo;minotaur&rdquo;. Although I
wouldn't argue a
minotaur would be a wonderful monitoring solution for many circumstances,
when it comes to computer hardware, Nagios is a little better, and far
more popular. OpenNMS is a newcomer to our victory circle, and although it's
far behind Nagios, it still scored quite well. &ldquo;Minotaur&rdquo;, as
it were,
got very few votes.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af7490"></a>
Best Database</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MySQL</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: PostgreSQL</em></span>
</p><p>
It may not be the most-exciting topic around, but databases make the world
go round. MySQL with its dolphin mascot takes first place again this year,
with more than twice as many votes as its closest competition, PostgreSQL.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af7750"></a>
Best Backup Solution</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: tar</em></span>
</p><p>
We geeks like our command line, and to back up stuff, nothing can beat
rsync and tar. rsync is three times more popular than tar based on reader
votes, but nothing else comes close when it comes to backup. For two
years running, we don't need no stinkin' GUI!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af79b8"></a>
Best Virtualization Solution</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
VirtualBox</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: VMware</em></span>
</p><p>
Although the Oracle purchase certainly affected the OpenOffice.org popularity,
VirtualBox's new ownership doesn't seem to bother anyone. VirtualBox is more
than four times as popular as the distant runner-up, VMware. We even lumped
the VMware options together, and they received only a cumulative 15% of the
vote. VirtualBox beat <span   class="emphasis"><em>virtually</em></span> every other option hands down.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af7cd0"></a>
Best Revision Control System</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Git</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Subversion</em></span>
</p><p>
The Linus-Torvalds-created Git remains in the number-one spot
this year, as it widens the gap a bit more from the runner-up,
Subversion. Either will do the job, but Subversion is becoming more and
more the underdog. Perhaps having Linus on your side is an advantage in
the Open Source world!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af7f38"></a>
Best Open-Source Configuration Management Tool</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Puppet</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: OpenQRM</em></span>
</p><p>
In another repeat performance from last year, Puppet takes top spot for
configuration management. If you administer greater than zero servers,
you will benefit from using a tool like Puppet. If you're managing fewer
than zero servers, well, we're not sure what that means. You probably
need Puppet to manage your counting skills. Whatever your reason,
configuration management is a hot topic, and Puppet is the hottest.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af81f8"></a>
Best Programming Language</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Python</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: C++</em></span>
</p><p>
A three-time winner in our best programming category, Python continues
to dominate. Close on its heels this year, however, is C++. In fact,
a scant 6% separated the two. It's quite obvious, however, that our
readers don't suffer from ophidiophobia in the
least&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>hiss</em></span>.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af8510"></a>
Best Scripting Language</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Python</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Bash</em></span>
</p><p>
It hardly seems fair that Python gets both best programming
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> best
scripting language, but I suppose excellence knows no bounds. A newcomer
to our runner-up circle is Bash, the only language I can program with
at all. Hats off to Python though, as it takes both categories again
this year.

Eclipse</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: vim</em></span>
</p><p>
Admit it, you weren't surprised at all to see Eclipse in top seat. Seeing
vim in the copilot seat, however, was a nostalgic treat for me. Eclipse is
incredibly extensible and remarkably quick in most environments. Nothing
can beat the simplicity of vim, however, and it took only 9% fewer votes
than Eclipse. There is no denying it, we're geeks.

Best Platform for Developing Rich Internet Applications</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
HTML5</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Adobe AIR</em></span>
</p><p>
HTML5 is the new kid on the block this year, and it managed to take 80% of
the vote! Adobe Air gets an honorable mention, but only on principle. It
was an entire order of magnitude less popular than HTML5.

Best Package Management Application</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
apt</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Synaptic</em></span>
</p><p>
It's no surprise that with Ubuntu and Debian in top spots for
distributions, apt would win handily for package management. Synaptic
is a far-off second place, with dozens of others taking up the rear. But,
our
favorite response for this topic was <tt  >configure; make; make
install</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2af8fb8"></a>
Best Content Management System</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
WordPress</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Drupal</em></span>
</p><p>
Our Webmistress, Katherine Druckman, is a die-hard Drupal fan&mdash;and for
good reason, the entire <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> site uses it and has for many
years. Perhaps just to prove she didn't rig the voting, WordPress takes
top spot again this year by a fairly narrow margin to Drupal. The great
thing about open source is that it's hard to lose whichever route you take.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d74fb0"></a>
Best Linux-Friendly Web-Hosting Company</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
&ldquo;Other&rdquo;</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: 1&amp;1 and GoDaddy.com (tie)</em></span>
</p><p>
We're taking these results as a good sign, in that perhaps so many
Web-hosting companies are Linux-friendly, it was hard to pick one over the
other. So in reality, GoDaddy and 1&amp;1 took more votes than any other
single Web-hosting company. Because their single-digit
&ldquo;victories&rdquo; seemed
a bit strange to celebrate, we gave them runner-up status to all the
other options you sent in. Feel free to cry foul; it just seemed
the logical thing to do.

Best Linux Laptop Vendor</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Dell</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: ASUS</em></span>
</p><p>
Dell still grabs the top spot here, similar to last year. In a second-place
upset, however, ASUS grabs the silver medal, and Lenovo (last
year's runner-up) didn't even make the chart. This category is becoming
less and less important every year, only because Linux is working on more
and more laptops out of the box. We think that's a great problem to have.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d75588"></a>
Best Linux Desktop Workstation Vendor</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Dell</b></span>
</p><p>
Dell is on everyone's love-letter list this year and took the desktop
workstation category by storm. In fact, the competition was so lopsided,
we can't even declare a runner-up. Dell gets all the penguin love.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d75740"></a>
Best Linux Server Vendor</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Dell</em></span>
</p><p>
Not to be outdone, IBM pulls through with a very narrow victory over the
ever-popular Dell in our server category. When it comes to server racks,
our readers trust Big Blue over anyone else (but just barely).

Best Linux Book</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> by Ellen Siever et al.</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: <span class="emphasis"><em>Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental
Revolutionary</em></span> by Linus Torvalds and David Diamond</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> from O'Reilly remains your favorite book again this
year. In fact, it took twice as many votes as the number-two favorite,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Just for Fun</em></span>. We mentioned <span   class="emphasis"><em>Just for
Fun</em></span> in last
year's Readers' Choice awards, and apparently many of you took the hint
and bought it.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d75e78"></a>
Best <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Column</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Hack and / by Kyle Rankin</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: Work the Shell by Dave Taylor</em></span>
</p><p>
Kyle takes the rest of us to task again this year, stealing the number-one spot for his Hack and / column. It's hard to hate Kyle, because he
truly is a helpful, humble, easy-going guy. The second spot goes to an
equally awesome individual, Dave Taylor. I know I'm biased, but picking
a favorite <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> column is like picking a favorite flavor of
ice cream&mdash;it's hard to go wrong!

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d761e8"></a>
Best Brand of Video Chipset</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
NVIDIA</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: ATI/AMD</em></span>
</p><p>
The big two in video chipsets are still NVIDIA and AMD. Intel is creeping
up as a force in the embedded-video-chipset realm, but NVIDIA and AMD
still are way ahead in popularity. NVIDIA takes more than twice as many
votes as AMD, but both are wildly more liked than Intel, the distant
third. No one likes the proprietary drivers, but we're all thankful to
have working software and accelerated video.

Best Linux Smartphone Manufacturer</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
HTC</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: Samsung</em></span>
</p><p>
This year, we tweaked the poll a little bit, and instead of looking for a
specific model of smartphone, we asked for your favorite manufacturer. The
race was tight between HTC's hackability and Samsung's wafer-thinness. HTC
edged out the competition, making it your favorite Linux smartphone
manufacturer&mdash;at least for now.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d76768"></a>
Best Linux Tablet Manufacturer</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Samsung</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Runner-up: ASUS</em></span>
</p><p>
In a newly created category, Samsung takes a clear and dominant victory
over the other companies with its Galaxy line of tablets. This field
is still very young, so it's hard to say what next year will bring, 
but for this year, nothing can touch Samsung. Our second-place company
scored some big points with the ASUS Transformer. Its unique design
allows a tablet computer to become an Android-powered laptop simply
by clicking the tablet into the keyboard accessory. This will be an exciting
category in the future, as competition is really starting to heat up.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d76a28"></a>
Best Other Linux-Based Gadget</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Amazon Kindle</b></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Runner-up: TomTom Navigation System</em></span>
</p><p>
The Kindle easily takes its place as your favorite Linux gadget
this year. We may have to change our categories a bit next year,
as the tablet/gadget/smartphone categories are starting to blend
together. However you slice it, the Kindle wins this year. And if you need
directions to the store in order to buy a Kindle? We recommend the TomTom Navigation System, also running Linux and also one of your favorites.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d76ce8"></a>
Best New Open-Source Project (released in 2010 or 2011)</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LibreOffice</b></span>
</p><p>
Although certainly standing on the shoulders of its progenitor, LibreOffice
continues to progress at an impressive rate. Because the fork is technically
a new project, your write-in votes were counted, and LibreOffice wins
the coveted spot as best new open-source project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f1580.0x2d76ea0"></a>
Product of the Year</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GNOME 3</b></span>
</p><p>
And the moment you've all been waiting for...the winner is...GNOME
3! Although very controversial and barely edging out Android, GNOME
3 takes our product of the year title for 2011. GNOME 3 represents a
drastic change in the way we compute on the desktop, and like its relative
Unity, it has some people shaking their heads in frustration. You've proven,
however, that change isn't always a bad thing, and GNOME 3 wins!


</p><p>
Be sure to follow our Web site this year, as we explore some of these
winners, and perhaps watch the runners-up to see if they edge out the
current incumbents. As for me, I'll be playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Goo</em></span>. I hear it's
rather good.
