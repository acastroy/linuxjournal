<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #212, December 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
You may have heard of the recent security breach that took place on
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span>. The attacker gained root access to the servers and
modified a kernel source-tree release candidate, in the hopes of
infecting lots of users.
</p><p>
Since then, the kernel.org system administrators have been working
like mad, cleaning out the servers and implementing security measures
that might hopefully prevent another attack. One such measure involves
restricting access to kernel.org itself. In the past, people
maintaining a git tree on kernel.org could get a shell account on that
system. Those days are gone. <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span> announced that the
<span   class="bold"><b>gitolite</b></span> tool would be used to update git trees from now on, and
shell access would no longer be handed out as freely as it was.
</p><p>
The kernel.org folks also are instituting a cryptographic &ldquo;web of
trust&rdquo;, so that people maintaining a git tree will be able to
establish their identity when doing updates. If you're a developer who
hacks the kernel in your spare time or for your employer and
typically submits patches via e-mail, you won't need to be part of the
web of trust; in fact, your work flow can continue unchanged. Only
folks involved in maintaining projects on kernel.org are affected by
these new policies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has expressed some doubt that cryptographic signatures
are as important as others believe. He's said, &ldquo;Realistically, I
checked a few signatures this time around due to the kernel.org
issues, but at the same time, the thing that made me trust most of it
was just looking at commits and the e-mail messages&mdash;the unconscious
and non-cryptographic 'signature' of a person acting like you
expect a
person to act.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> has resubmitted his patch that
makes <span   class="bold"><b>3.0 kernels</b></span> pretend to
be 2.6 kernels, so binary-only software expecting to run on a 2.6
kernel still will run correctly under 3.0 kernels. It's an ugly pill
to swallow. This time around, Linus Torvalds asked which binary-only
software actually was breaking under 3.0, and a number of people
replied, listing off several applications. Some <span   class="bold"><b>HP</b></span> management tools
were among them. There also were a lot of nonbinary applications,
including a number of Python scripts that performed an incorrect test
for the current kernel version number.
</p><p>
Linus seems very reluctant to adopt this patch, especially considering
that Andi has stated positively it's not just a short-term fix, but
that 3.0 kernels would have to continue to masquerade as 2.6 kernels
for the long term, in order to maintain compatibility with those
binary-only tools.

I've realized I've missed out on a huge area of computational
science&mdash;chemistry. Many packages exist for doing chemistry
on your desktop. This article looks at a general tool called
avogadro. It can do computations of energy and gradient values.
Additionally, it can
do analysis of molecular systems, interface to GAMESS and import and
export from and to several file formats. There also are lots of options
for generating pretty pictures of your totally new molecule
that you hope will revolutionize the chemical industry.
</p><p>
When you first start avogadro, it opens up a new project
consisting of one tab for a view of the molecule. Within this window,
you can create a molecule in several different ways. If you want,
you can build your molecule step by step, one atom at a time. You can
click on the pencil at the top or press F8 to select the draw tool. With
this, you can click and drag to draw atoms and bonds. To select different
elements or different bond types, click on the Tool
Settings button to get a second panel with those options available. To
draw, click with the left mouse button. To erase, click with
the right mouse button. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11173avogadrof1.large.jpg"><img src="11173avogadrof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you open avogadro, you get an empty view window
in a new project.
</p></div></div><p>
You also have the option of building it up
from molecule fragments. Under the Build menu item, select
Insert&rarr;Fragment. This pops up a window where you can select from
among molecule fragments, such as carboxylic acids, ketones, alkanes or amino
acids. You even can build a buckminsterfullerene with a single click. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11173avogadrof2.large.jpg"><img src="11173avogadrof2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can choose from a large list of chemical fragments in order to
build your molecule.
</p></div></div><p>
As
you build up the molecule, it appears in the view window. You also can
insert a fragment by entering a SMILES text string. SMILES is the
Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification. Check 
the Wikipedia entry for more details on its format. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11173avogadrof3.large.jpg"><img src="11173avogadrof3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Here's what a water molecule would look like.
</p></div></div><p>
There is also a
peptide builder under the menu entry Build&rarr;Insert&rarr;Peptide. This
dialog window lets you build up a peptide by selecting the amino acids,
the terminating fragments and the structure of the
peptide. The available structures are straight chain, alpha helix and beta
sheet. 
</p><p>
You can make global adjustments to your molecule by adjusting the
hydrogen bonds. You can do a global replacement of changing hydrogens to
methyl groups. You also can change the number of hydrogen atoms based on
the pH of the molecule. 
</p><p>
You can save this molecule in several different
formats, including CML, GAMESS Input, Gaussian Input, MDL SDfile, PDB,
NWChem Input, Sybyl Mol2 and XYZ.
</p><p>
Once you are done building your molecule, one of the first things
you may want to do is get an idea of what it actually looks like. As
a first approximation, you can use the Optimize Geometry function,
located under the Extensions menu item. This actually goes
through your molecule and adjusts the bond lengths and the bond angles
to optimize your molecule's physical geometry. You can select
what force field is used to do this calculation. Under the menu item
Extensions&rarr;Molecular Mechanics&rarr;Setup Force Field, a new window 
pops up letting you choose which force field you want to use, along with the
number of steps to take, the algorithm to use (either Steepest Descent
or Conjugate Gradients) and the convergence threshold. Depending on
your molecule's complexity, some settings may work better than
others. For example, the MMFF94(s) field is good for organic chemistry
and drug-like molecules. 
If you try to optimize the geometry and 
get odd-looking results, checking these options should be your first
step. You can see the calculation's progress by clicking on the
Messages tab at the bottom of the window. 
</p><p>
Once you have optimized your
geometry, you can calculate your molecule's energy by selecting
Extensions&rarr;Molecular Dynamics&rarr;Calculate Energy.
</p><p>
There is a limited amount that you can do directly in avogadro in terms of
actual quantum-level calculations. But, that's okay, because 
lots of really good programs exist that already do that very well. You can
use avogadro to output files that can be used by these other programs as
input files to do such higher-level computations. Under the Extension
menu item you will find entries to build input files for GAMESS,
Gaussian, MOLPRO, MOPAC, NWChem and Q-Chem. Each of those entries pops
open a new dialog window where you can select the extra options for the
to-be-created input file. This includes things like the number of
processors to use, the type of calculation to do or the theory to use,
for example. A preview window shows you what this export
file will look like, so you can be sure you're getting what you 
were expecting. Once you're happy, click on the generate button
at the bottom of the window to generate the input file for the external
program of interest.
</p><p>
Once these calculations are done, you can import them back into avogadro
to do some analysis. You can import trajectory files or vibration
files. Once that data is imported, functions are available to graph
this data in order to extract information and see what's happening. For
files that contain molecular vibration information, you even can graph the
results as a movie. You have some options in terms of the frame rate and so
on, and once you are satisfied, you can save it as an AVI file. 
</p><p>
You also
can import data from experiments too. When studying chemicals, one common experiment
is to look at the spectra of the chemical of interest. To
start, click on the menu item Extensions&rarr;Spectra. This
pops open a new window in which to do the analysis. At the bottom of the screen,
you can click on Load Data. This lets you import data in two formats:
either PWscf IR data or Turbomole IR data. You can select how this data is
displayed, including producing publication-quality graphics.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11173avogadrof4.large.jpg"><img src="11173avogadrof4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Here I'm ready to upload spectral data from actual experimental
measurements.
</p></div></div><p>
Hopefully, this short introduction gives you some ideas for getting
started. Lots of other chemistry programs exist that you
can look at to offer more functions and calculations. Now you're ready
to go out and do some quantum chemistry.

We've covered the cross-platform video player VLC in past issues, but if
you're an OS X user, it's often preferable to use QuickTime. Because it's
built into the operating system, QuickTime integrates with almost every
aspect of the system. Unfortunately, QuickTime has limited playback
support. Enter Perian. Perian is an open-source plugin for QuickTime that
gives the native player the ability to play most popular video formats.
The Perian Web site lists the following supported formats:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
File formats: AVI, DIVX, FLV, MKV, GVI, VP6 and VFW.
</p></li><li><p>
Video types: MS-MPEG4 v1 and v2, DivX, 3ivx, H.264, Sorenson H.263,
FLV/Sorenson Spark, FSV1, VP6, H263i, VP3, HuffYUV, FFVHuff, MPEG1 and
MPEG2 video, Fraps, Snow, NuppelVideo, Techsmith Screen Capture and DosBox
Capture.
</p></li><li><p>
Audio types: Windows Media Audio v1 and v2, Flash ADPCM, Xiph Vorbis (in
Matroska), MPEG Layer I and II Audio, True Audio, DTS Coherent Acoustics
and Nellymoser ASAO.
</p></li><li><p>
AVI support for AAC, AC3 Audio, H.264, MPEG4, VBR MP3 and more.
</p></li><li><p>
Subtitle support for SSA/ASS, SRT and SAMI.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Is Perian better than VLC? No, it's not better or worse; it's different.
If you want to play unsupported multimedia formats with Apple's QuickTime
player, Perian can make that happen. If you'd rather use a completely
open-source player application, VLC fits the bill. Either way, open source
saves the day with the ability to play back just about any file you'd ever
want to play. Check out Perian at <a href="http://www.perian.org" target="_self">www.perian.org</a>.

If you use a dedicated e-reader to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> every month,
chances are you want to read other material on it as well. Thanks to a
free service called Instapaper, if you have an e-reader like the
Linux-powered Kindle, you can take your favorite Web articles with
you on the go, even if your destination doesn't have Internet access!
</p><p>
Instapaper works by giving you a bookmark to click any time you
want to view a Web page later on your e-reader. Then, from your Internet-enabled mobile device, you can read the articles at your leisure. For
those folks with a Kindle, Instapaper provides a free delivery service
that sends batches of articles to your Amazon account. It's important
to realize Amazon will charge you for 3G-based deliveries, but if your
Kindle supports Wi-Fi, delivery is free as well.
</p><p>

This past summer, I went to a beach resort in Mexico with my wife. It
made sense to get into a little better shape so as not to cause any
beached-whale rumors while I soaked in the rays. Typical geek that I am,
I wanted to track my every move so I could see how much exercise
I really was doing. And, I wanted to do that with technology.
</p><p>
Thankfully, RunKeeper is available for Android. RunKeeper is an exercise-tracking app that uses GPS to track your exercise. Thanks to geographical
information over GPS, RunKeeper will track your distance, pace, time and
even elevation. The free version provides lots of awesome features, and
its social features also can help keep you accountable. (Although your Twitter
followers might get tired of hearing about your daily walks to the park.)
</p><p>
Several other exercise apps are available, so if RunKeeper isn't
your cup of tea, just search for &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; in the
Marketplace, and
you'll find a plethora of options. Keep in mind, however, that GPS-based
exercise-tracking programs aren't much good in the northern winters,
when running moves indoors to a treadmill.

<h2 class="title">Goodbye GNOME 2, Hello GNOME 2?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #212, December 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many Linux users who have been GNOME fans for years find themselves in a
sudden quandary. GNOME 3.0 has completely abandoned the desktop experience
we've come to love during the years. That's not to say change is bad,
it's just that many folks (even Linus Torvalds) don't really want
to change.
</p><p>
As an Ubuntu user for several years, I'm accustomed to how well
Canonical makes Linux on the desktop &ldquo;just work&rdquo;.
Unfortunately, Ubuntu's
alternative to the GNOME 3 switch is Unity. I want to like Unity. I've
forced myself to use it to see if it might grow on me after a while. It
hasn't. And, to make matters worse, version 11.10 won't have a classic
GNOME option, which means I either need to bite the bullet and get used
to Unity or go with an alternative.
</p><p>
Thankfully, XFCE has all the features I love about GNOME. No, XFCE isn't
exactly like GNOME, but it feels more like GNOME 2 than GNOME 3 does! If
you are like me and desperately want to have the old GNOME interface you
know and love, I recommend checking out Xubuntu (the version of Ubuntu that
uses XFCE). With minimal tweaking,
it can look and feel like GNOME 2. Plus, XFCE has the ability to start
GNOME (or KDE) services on login, which means GNOME-native apps usually
&ldquo;just work&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The time may come when we're forced to adopt a new desktop model. For
the time being, however, alternatives like XFCE or even LDXE offer
familiar and highly functional desktop experiences. If you fear GNOME
3 and Unity, try XFCE. Download Xubuntu and
check it out: <a href="http://www.xubuntu.org" target="_self">www.xubuntu.org</a>.
