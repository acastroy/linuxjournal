Determine the frequency of letters within a document
(and become unbeatable at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span>).

If you can remember back a month, you'll recall that I'd received a
blessed e-mail from someone (hint, hint) asking:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Dear Dave, I seek an edge when I next play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span> or other word
games. I want to know what words are most common in the English language
and what letters are most common in written material too. If you can show
how to do that as a shell script, it'd be useful for your column, but if
not, can you point me to an on-line resource? Thanks.&mdash;Mike R.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I grabbed three books from the Project Gutenberg archive (<a href="http://gutenberg.org" target="_self">gutenberg.org</a>) to
analyze and use as test input: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span> by Bram Stoker,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>History of the
United States</em></span> by Charles A. Beard and Mary Ritter Beard, and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pride and
Prejudice</em></span> by Jane Austen.
</p><p>
The obvious way to analyze these text files is with the wc
command, which reveals that, combined, we're looking at 497,663 words,
2.9 million characters.
</p><p>
We used the following to identify the most common words:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *txt | tr ' ' '\012' | \
     tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
     tr -d '[:punct:]' | grep -v '[^a-z]' | \
     sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
</pre>
</p><p>
The results were sufficient to reveal that the top ten words that appear in
our 500,000-word sample are, in order: the, of, and, to, in, a, i, was,
that and it.
</p><p>
Now, let's go in a different direction and analyze letter frequency.
Then, we'll go back to finding interesting and unusual words.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2181580.0x22799e0"></a>
Calculating Letter Frequency</h2></div></div><p>
The question underlying calculating letter frequency is this: &ldquo;how do you
break down a word into individual letters so that you have one letter per
line?&rdquo; It turns out that the handy Linux tool fold can do
exactly what we want:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo hello | fold -w1
h
e
l
l
o
</pre>
</p><p>
Neatly done! (Note that you can't use fmt or similar commands because
even if you specify -w1 for width, it works with words, not
characters.)
</p><p>
It's an easy leap from there to make fold break down every
single word in a text file, sort the results, and use our power duo of
<tt  >uniq -c | sort -rn</tt> to get the results we seek:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ fold -w1 &lt; dracula.txt | sort | \
      uniq -c | sort -rn | head
157559
78409 e
56524 t
51608 a
50568 o
43453 n
41749 h
38150 s
37950 i
35001 r

</pre>
</p><p>
A blank is the most common, but we can skip that visually rather than
complicate our pipe with yet another process.
</p><p>
As I said in the beginning, E is the most common letter, but
it's a surprise to see T as the second most common, frankly.
Maybe it's because we're not compensating for upper-/lowercase?
Let's try again:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ fold -w1 &lt; dracula.txt | sort | \
      tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | uniq -c | \
      sort -rn | head -5
157559
78409 E
56524 T
51608 A
50568 O

</pre>
</p><p>
Wait a minute. We shouldn't get the same result! Hmmm...can you see
what I've done wrong? Hint: look at the order of commands in the pipe.
</p><p>
Got it? The tr needs to appear before the first sort command, or
it transforms the output, but after it already has been sorted
separately. We also should strip out punctuation, which can be done
with the tr command as well. Here's a better attempt:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ fold -w1 &lt; dracula.txt | \
      tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | sort | \
      tr -d '[:punct:]' | uniq -c | \
      sort -rn | head
157559
79011 E
58618 T
53146 A
51122 O
43975 N
43501 H
43423 I
39296 S
35607 R

</pre>
</p><p>
Will this ordering change if we use all three of our books rather than just
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dracula</em></span>? Let's try it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *.txt | fold -w1 | \
     tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' | sort | \
     tr -d '[:punct:]' | uniq -c | \
     sort -rn | head
468727
273409 E
201726 T
175637 A
169836 O
158561 N
155910 I
135513 S
133927 R
127716 H
</pre>
</p><p>
Same result! In order of frequency, the letters appear in text in the
following sequence: E T A O N I S R H D L C U M F W G P Y B V K X J Q Z.
(I'm a bit surprised that J shows up so infrequently.)
</p><p>
You now know what order to guess letters in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span>, if nothing else.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2181580.0x227a170"></a>
Speaking of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Before we wrap this up, let's go back through the words in our corpus
and find just those that are at least ten letters long and occur
infrequently. Here's how I'll do that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat *.txt | tr ' ' '\012' | \
     tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | \
     tr -d '[:punct:]' | tr -d '[0-9]' | \
     sort | uniq -c | sort -n | \
     grep -E '..................' | head
   1 abolitionists
   1 accommodation
   1 accommodations
   1 accomplishing
   1 accomplishments
   1 accountability
   1 achievements
   1 acknowledging
   1 acknowledgments
   1 acquaintanceship
   1 administrative
   1 advertisement
</pre>
</p><p>
That gives us long words that occur infrequently in the English
language&mdash;or, at least only once in the 500,000 word corpus we've been analyzing.
</p><p>
(True confession: I simply added more and more dots to the grep
regular expression until I weeded out almost all of the results. I could
also have used .{10,} to get ten-character or longer matches.)
</p><p>
Some of these words obviously are more common in everyday parlance than in
these particular books, however, such as advertisement, which
I'm sure occurs more than once every 500,000 words in normal
conversation, or at least in the circles I frequent!
</p><p>
What would really be great for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span> would be to
apply the letter-frequency rule further, so that you extract the infrequently occurring
words, then
come up with a sum value for the frequency of each letter in the word
(I'd assign E = 1, T = 2, A = 3, O = 4, for example) and identify the
longest words with the highest scores. Those will be your very best
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hangman</em></span>
words.
</p><p>
But, I'm out of space and last I checked, I was supposed to be writing
about different variable reference formats in shell scripts anyway. I
swear, next column, I'll get back to that. Unless you (hint, hint) write
me a note with a puzzle or scripting challenge to solve.
