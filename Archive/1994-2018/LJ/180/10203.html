Using FreeBoo, you can restore and boot different operating systems
across a network and replace proprietary solutions such as Rembo.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fed460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Administrating large installations of computer desktops requires
many tedious system reparations due to software updates, hardware
fixes, user mistakes and viruses. To reduce costs, some
enterprises adopt restrictive IT politics. But, if your business cannot
afford a highly secure and restrictive environment, and you want to provide
your many users with dual-boot capacity,
desktop administration privileges and the possibility to execute a
large amount of different software, you probably are using Rembo.
</p><p>
This article presents FreeBoo, an open architecture that provides you with
a dual-boot system of secure desktop images. FreeBoo is based on network
boot, provides image restoration and allows hot boot. With
FreeBoo, any malicious software installation done on a desktop by a
previous user can be overwritten seamlessly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fed670"></a>
Image Restoring and Dual Boot</h2></div></div><p>
Many IT departments' efforts are dedicated to the time-consuming task
of repairing end-user desktops. For this task, most IT systems use
open-source imaging systems that exist today, such as SystemImager, partimage,
FileZilla, clonezilla, Frisbee, rsync, rdiff-backup, ADIOS and so on, or
their commercial equivalents, including Norton Ghost, Active, True Image and
Image. All these tools create a compressed image of a client's hard drive
data and save it in case a future data recovery is necessary. An
image is the complete copy of a filesystem, and it usually is stored on
a backup server. When image changes are small,
incremental backup is used to improve performance.
</p><p>
Imaging systems use well-known IETF protocols to transfer data from
client to server or vice versa. They also include many functionalities
for image management, with easy-to-use GUIs. IT departments in charge
of large installations also use them to clone OS images onto several
identical computers and to update systems with new patches.
</p><p>
In general,
this software requires a high level of expertise, works basically on-demand
and runs with a client program. This last feature is very important,
because it assumes that the client computer is executing with specific
conditions. Typically, this means the client always executes the
same operating system.
</p><p>
At our university, computer labs can boot either MS Windows or Linux
operating systems, and students select the desired partition using
Rembo. Other PC-compatible dual-boot options include Norton BootMagic, OSL2000
or the MSTBOOT commercial systems and the GRUB open-source software solution. But,
none of these tools can dual boot from the network.
</p><p>
Rembo is the only
existing tool that provides the option of restoring any of the computer's saved
images. And, very important, once the image is recovered,
the computer boots it directly. Rembo is a commercial evolution of the
open-source BP Batch Project, recently integrated into the IBM Tivoli
suite. Rembo introduces local disk caches for fast image restoration,
is able to use multicast messages and can be programmed using the
Rembo-C scripting language.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fed8d8"></a>
FreeBoo Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
FreeBoo is proposed as an open-source, alternative solution to
Rembo. Instead of open-source software, FreeBoo is an architecture
built from many existing open-source programs. In fact, the number
of new lines of code is insignificant. We have written only
eight simple scripts and have used the urldecoder script authored
by Heiner Steven. Figure 1 shows the global picture. The open protocols
used include TFTP, DHCP, HTTP and NFS. And, the open-source code, running
either on the server or client includes PXELinux, rsync, partimage, Apache,
Netcat, links2 and gensplash. In Figure 1, you can see which program
is executed at each computer site (client or server).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10203f1.large.jpg"><img src="10203f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Global View of the FreeBoo Components
</p></div></div><p>
To illustrate the use of FreeBoo, let's assume the following scenario: ten or more desktops
connected by LAN with a remote, non-accessible server room, using a
PXE-compliant NIC. The desktops boot in three phases, as shown in Figure 2.
The first phase is similar to a thin-client boot. In the second phase, the
user selects a boot option, and the necessary image data is sent to the
client. Finally, in the third phase, the client computer boots the
user-selected OS.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10203f2.large.jpg"><img src="10203f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. FreeBoo Phases
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fede00"></a>
Thin-Client Boot Phase</h2></div></div><p>
To build a FreeBoo system, you first need to configure 
your client's BIOS to boot from the network and to dedicate a server
for PXE. You must start the DHCP and TFTP d&aelig;mons on your server and
use the Pxelinux.0 file as the PXE primary bootstrap.
</p><p>
The main consideration regarding your thin-client configuration is the actual
image properties. Because it is only a temporary image, let's configure a small
embedded Gentoo Linux with generic drivers (less than 6Mb). We will add the
FUSE drivers, the kexec system call introduced in the 2.6 kernel and 
NFS, rsync and partimage client utilities. FUSE is required, because we
need write access to the NTFS partition during image restoration. kexec
is used for the hot boot. The thin client uses an NFS root filesystem
to avoid the initial RAM filesystem transfer done by most thin-client
solutions. The NFS option is slower for individual access but faster
for an initial deployment (more on using rsync and partimage
in the next section). 
</p><p>
To get a nice user interface, we also
add the framebuffer driver, Gensplash (Gentoo's bootsplash software)
and the Links2 browser compiled with direct framebuffer
support. The
Links2 text browser and Gensplash text images for framebuffer let you avoid the
cost of the X Window System and its configuration problems, while achieving
some graphical capacities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fee010"></a>
Image Selection and Restoration Phase</h2></div></div><p>
The second phase consists of presenting a boot menu to the end user and
(if required) executing the image restoration. This FreeBoo phase
starts when the client PC is running the Linux thin client. You should
configure it to execute the Links2 text Web browser initially. Simply
add this init.d file to your thin-client filesystem (located
in the server's drive and accessed via NFS):

<pre     class="programlisting">
#/etc/init.d/freeboo
depends () {
  after gpm
  after local
  depends local
}
start() {
  /scripts/freeboostart.sh
  eend 0
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The freeboostart.sh script executes the Web browser:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# Part of the /scripts/freeboostart.sh file
links2 -g server_IP
# ...
</pre>
</p><p>
The Apache Web server responds with an HTML file that
contains the end-user menu. Figure 3 shows the available boot options.
The user can choose to boot
a given OS directly or to restore its saved copy. If the user selects a
direct boot, FreeBoo skips directly to phase three. Otherwise, FreeBoo
proceeds first to transfer the OS image to the client.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10203f3.large.jpg"><img src="10203f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Boot Menu
</p></div></div><p>
The menu provides two image restoring policies: complete (or full)
restoring and partial (or fast) restoring. Complete restoring
transfers all of the image to the client computer using partimage.
Partial restoring transfers only the modified data using rsync. Depending
on the differences with the current image, one solution is faster than the
other. We have found that for partial restoring, the checksum computation
was especially time consuming for large files. But, both
solutions achieve the same goal&mdash;to deploy a clean and secure OS image
on the client.
</p><p>
In addition to configuring Apache and setting the boot menu
page as the user's initial page, you also need to start the rsyncd and
the partimaged d&aelig;mons on the server.
rsyncd, for partial restoring, uses virtual names for the OS
images. Its configuration file (/etc/rsyncd.conf) assigns each virtual
name to a path in the filesystem. You should create a disk partition
for each OS image, because rsync is filesystem-sensitive. Specifically,
you need an NTFS filesystem and the FUSE ntfs-3g mount command for writing
the MS Windows image on the client. We recommend excluding the big and
unneeded MS Windows virtual memory file (pagefile.sys) and the hibernate
file in the rsync recovery command (flag --exclude-from).
We also recommend deleting any user-created files on the client (flag --delete).
Additionally,
add the flags -a (maintain permissions, ownership and timestamps), -r
(recursive) and -v (verbose). Below is the code for the syncroLinux.sh
and syncroWindows.sh scripts. They differ only in the mount command and
image and partition names:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# /script/syncroWindows.sh and /script/syncroLinux.sh
# FreeBoo scripts for partial image restoring
#
# INSERT the correct mount command
#   for Linux:      mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/linux
#   for MS-Windows: ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -o force

ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -o force

# INSERT the correct rsync command
#   rsync -avr --delete --exclude-from=.rsync/exclude \
#         SERVER_IP::SYNC_NAME DEST_FOLDER

rsync -avr --delete --exclude-from=.rsync/exclude \
      192.168.1.1::windows /mnt/windows

# ... continues with kexec commands ...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fee590"></a>
Full Image Restoring</h2></div></div><p>
For full image restoration, we use partimage. partimage is much
simpler than rsync, because it is not filesystem-dependent. You simply
need to create a directory on the server to store the partimage chunk
files. Chunks are just data that can be stored in any ext3
filesystem. Because the client gives the full path to the image chunks,
you don't need any special configuration for partimaged. The flags
to add are -f3 (quit when finished), -b (batch mode) and, for performance
issues, -z# (level of compression). Below is the code that restores
full images (the restoreLinux.sh and restoreWindows.sh scripts):


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# /scripts/restoreLinux.sh and /scripts/restoreWindows.sh
# FreeBoo scripts for full image restoring
#
# INSERT the correct partimage command
#   partimage -f3 -b -s SERVER_IP restore DEST_DEVICE IMAGE
partimage -f3 -b -s 192.168.1.1 \
          restore /dev/hda2 /root/fileImage/linux

# ...continues with kexec commands ...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fee748"></a>
Hot Boot Phase</h2></div></div><p>
The third, and most challenging, FreeBoo phase is the image hot boot.
When we started working on
FreeBoo, our first idea was to enter into the Linux kernel code to write the hot boot
function. But while examining the code, we discovered the kexec system call
and its related shell commands. The following two scripts are able to
hot boot an OS image installed on a local drive.
</p><p>
Linux hot boot script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# /scripts/startLinux.sh
# FreeBoo script for Linux hot boot
#
mount /dev/hda2 /mnt/images/linux
kexec -l /mnt/images/linux/vmlinuz \
      --append="root=/dev/hda2 ro quiet splash" \
      --initrd="/mnt/images/linux/boot/initrd.img-2.6.15-23-386"

kexec -e
</pre>
</p><p>
MS Windows hot boot script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# /scripts/startWindows.sh
# FreeBoo script for Windows hot boot
#
ntfs-3g /dev/hda1 /mnt/images/windows -o nonempty
kexec -l /mnt/images/windows/grub.exe
kexec -e
</pre>
</p><p>
Both scripts first mount the partition of the OS image, then they
execute kexec -l, and finally, they execute the new OS kernel with kexec
-e. The OS kernel must be an ELF executable. For Linux, this is the
kernel file directly, but for MS Windows, we use the GRUB bootloader (you should
replace the NTLR default bootloader with the GRUB bootloader before
saving the client MS Windows image on the server). Finally, you need a
GRUB bootloader, such as Grub4dos, with built-in BIOS disk emulation and an ATAPI CD-ROM driver.
This is needed because the thin-client execution overwrites the
BIOS and most MS Windows versions still rely on some BIOS interrupts for video,
timers and disk-related hardware I/O.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1feea60"></a>
Script Execution</h2></div></div><p>
The final consideration to get FreeBoo working is in respect to
the execution of the script files. We have one script file for each
of the six alternatives in the user's menu. These files are located
on the server, but we need them to execute on the client. In the menu's
HTML code, the links to the scripts are localhost references&mdash;for
example, &lt;a
href="http://localhost/scritps/startLinux.sh"&gt;, so the Web browser
will try to connect to a local Web server. But, we have not installed
any Web server on the client image, because we wanted a light and fast
kernel. Instead, we have included two additional scripts in FreeBoo to
provide a local Web server.
Both scripts are initiated by /etc/init.d/freeboo. Below are the
complete freeboostart.sh and the new mini_webapp_s.sh
scripts.
</p><p>
Initial freeboostart.sh script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh
# /scripts/freeboostart.sh
# FreeBoo script that starts a very simple http
# server with script execution capacity
# in parallel with a web browser
#
mini_webapp_s.sh &amp;
links2 -g YOUR_SERVER_IP

</pre>
</p><p>
The mini_webapp_s.sh script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# /scripts/mini_webapp_s.sh
# FreeBoo script that parsers the incoming browser 
# request, gets the script path name and 
# executes it locally
#
torun=`nc -l -p 80 -s 127.0.0.1 | \
         awk '/HTTP/{print $2; exit}' | \
         urldecoder.sh`
($torun)
</pre>
</p><p>
The first script starts the links2 Web browser mentioned previously.
But, it also starts the mini_webapp_s.sh
script in parallel to act as a very simple Web server with application execution
capacities. This second script executes the output of a pipeline command
composed of netcat, awk and urldecoder, which extracts the filename of
the script to execute.
</p><p>
Netcat (nc) is a very simple command. Like the traditional cat command,
netcat simply copies data from an input stream to an output stream;
the only difference is that these streams can be network data. The -l flag
(listen mode) specifies that netcat's input comes from the network. The -p 80 and
-s 127.0.0.1 options indicate that the input will come on port 80 (the HTTP
default port) from IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost). Netcat's function is to redirect
any HTTP request, like the one below, to the awk filter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GET /scripts/syncroWindows.sh HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: ...etc...
</pre>
</p><p>
The awk command extracts the script filename found on the HTTP
GET line and passes it to the urldecoder.sh script through a second
pipe. urldecoder.sh is a well-known script used to convert a URL with
special characters, such as blank spaces, to a valid filename. The parser
pipeline finishes when the HTTP of the GET line is found. Then, the
variable $torun is set with its output and immediately executed. In the
example above, the user has selected the MS Windows fast restore, and
the HTTP request contains the /scripts/syncroWindows.sh filename. The
pipeline extracts this name, and the next line executes it on the client.
</p><p>
The links2 browser, which is executing in parallel, is waiting for the HTTP
response from our local Web server. Because we don't need any more
interaction with the user, instead of sending back a response, we have
included a line to kill the links2 process in each of the six menu scripts:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# first line of {start | syncro | restore}{Linux | Windows}.sh scripts
killall links2
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef5580.0x1fe5818"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The BP Batch Project, started at the Geneve University by Marc
V. Stuckelberg and David Clerc, became a popular open implementation of
the thin client. This approach evolved into the commercial Rembo suite, which
is used in many labs with a significant licensing cost. FreeBoo uses
a combination of existing open-source technologies, including BP Batch,
to provide the main features of Rembo.
</p><p>
The hardware requirements for installing FreeBoo are just
a dedicated server connected to client desktops by a LAN.
Desktops need to have only boot-on-LAN capacities and local disk drives.
All the software used is open source.
</p><p>
Future extensions of FreeBoo include the use of this technology for
server software deployment; the development of a Web-based interface for
easy administration of images, including database management;
evaluation of the performance of the OS restoration process to improve it
and to select the best option automatically (instead of having the user
decide between the fast or full options); the insertion of multicast
image recovery; and finally, the use of Wake-on-LAN capabilities to deploy
secure images to desktops at preprogrammed times.
</p><p>
FreeBoo is only the
initial step in building an open-source boot environment for system
administrators that allows you to fix, deploy and execute OS images on
large installations of desktops.
