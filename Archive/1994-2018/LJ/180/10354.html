Kyle and Bill face off on mail client software.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18fc580.0x19f4618"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In our argument...I mean, in our
last column, we discussed the
pros and cons of owning a large laptop versus a small one. This month,
we delve into something a little more personal: choice of mail
client software and why one would want to use a text-based mail client
over one that's graphical. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span>
I'm a Thunderbird user, and Kyle prefers the
retro-exoticism of Mutt. I'll let Kyle kick off the conversation, as
I'm sure he'll have something pithy to say about what an amazing and cool mail program
Mutt is.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> For starters, let's talk about
startup times. Because Mutt is so
lightweight, I don't even notice the startup times. For instance, I just
timed how long it took me to start Mutt and have it open the INBOX and then
exit as fast as I could:

<pre     class="programlisting">
greenfly@minimus:~$ time mutt
Mailbox is unchanged.
real    0m0.782s
user    0m0.096s
sys     0m0.036s
</pre>
</p><p>
That's right, 0.8 seconds. I could have been even faster, but my reflexes are
slowing in my old age. In fact, Mutt starts up so fast, that unlike other
programs on my desktop&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>cough</em></span>, Firefox
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cough</em></span>&mdash;I don't have to leave it
open. I just press a hotkey and launch it when I have new e-mail.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I just timed Thunderbird, and it
took about ten seconds to start up
and be done checking mail. Thunderbird may take ten seconds to launch and
check mail in all my folders, but it's not like ten seconds is a large
amount of time. Once it's open, I leave it open until I'm done with the
computer, so it's a ten-second hit, once. There's more to life than raw
speed. Good luck with LDAP lookups for corporate address books using Mutt.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Oh yes, ten seconds sure sounds a lot like 0.8 seconds. And yes, LDAP
lookups. I guess that would be a problem if Mutt weren't so extensible.
Because you can make its query command anything you want, you can point to
any script. The Internet was kind enough to provide an LDAP query script
for me, and other people have queried Gmail and other contact databases.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Whatever. You need Postfix or some
other MTA to send e-mail. What kind
of ridiculousness is that? Yeah, another server process on my
<span   class="emphasis"><em>laptop</em></span> to maintain and troubleshoot. That sounds like a great
idea. Thunderbird can talk SMTP (and even SMTP over TLS, shocking though it
may seem!) natively. Even Eudora has enough brains to talk to an SMTP server
natively, and that was back in 1994. Oh, wait. You use Mutt. Hey, Kyle,
1989 called; they want their VT-100 back.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Who needs to talk to an MTA directly when every Linux system has its
own mail server? A local mail server will handle delivering my mail much
better and stabler than any client could. What ever happened to &ldquo;Do one
thing and do it well&rdquo;?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That's arguable, but beyond the scope of this column. Besides, Mutt
has other things that drive me batty...like the user interface. It drives
me insane. It's hyper-pedantic. Gotta mark all messages as read?
Ctrl-Alt-D+*+infinity sign or something. It's so much easier to
right-click on the Inbox and say &ldquo;Mark all as read&rdquo; in Thunderbird.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah, easier up front and slower for the rest of time. Sure Mutt uses
keybindings (familiar ones if you have ever used vim), but the learning
curve pays off big-time as you blow through your mail. I can launch Mutt,
read through all my new mail, and close it, before Bill's Thunderbird
process finishes loading.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> But, then I lose a valuable caffeine break. I click on Thunderbird,
have a sip of Coke Zero, and take a quick peek at the latest LOLcats while
it loads&mdash;no bother at all. What about mail delivery to Mutt? It doesn't
support IMAP IDLE, does it? If you're all about speed, you'd want that
feature. I seem to remember being more &ldquo;on top&rdquo; of e-mail than you were,
back when we sat across from each other.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> The only systems I've ever noticed any IMAP issues on, were ones
back-ended on Exchange. Mutt always has gotten fast notifications from my
Linux-based IMAP servers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> And, Exchange is perhaps the most popular mail server in corporate
environments.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> What about the RAM footprint? I wanted to get some metrics for this
column from top, but when I launched it and sorted by RAM, Mutt didn't even
show up on the console. I had to stretch my terminal until it filled the
entire screen before I could find the Mutt process.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> My Thunderbird process shows it
eating, I mean, using 128MB 
of RAM. I don't mind, I have 4 gigs in this thing. What about calendar
integration? Thunderbird offers a plugin called Lightning to integrate my
Google Calendar in one interface. Try that with Mutt.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Oh, that's right&mdash;you have a
Sport Utility Laptop with 4GB of RAM. In any
case, I never understood checking your calendar with your e-mail program. It
always seemed like two unrelated things&mdash;unless I guess you were born and
raised on Outlook.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Here's a clue: most of the world was born and raised on Outlook.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> My magic eight ball says
&ldquo;Outlook not so good.&rdquo; Anyway, another great
thing about Mutt is that I can check my e-mail from any system in the world,
provided I can get access to putty (if it's Windows) or a Linux terminal to
ssh into my server. Bill has to download and install Thunderbird, configure
it, and then pay for another hour at the Internet caf&eacute;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> No, that's when I use my BlackBerry.
If that's your &ldquo;speed&rdquo; use
case, I'll put my quickdraw BlackBerry up against your mini laptop anytime,
Black Bart.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Certainly sounds like Thunderbird is great, since you have to
supplement it with one or two other mail clients.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Man, my grandmother
&ldquo;gets&rdquo; Thunderbird. I put Mutt in front of her,
and I may as well have asked her to prove Ohm's Law using calculus.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Ohm's Law, eh? Well not everyone shows such resistance (pun intended)
to Mutt. Another thing Mutt got right is configurability. Just about
anything you would want to configure, you can configure in Mutt. At first, I
spent some time getting things just right, but ultimately, Mutt is like a
finely tailored suit&mdash;you do a few tweaks here and there, and then it fits
you perfectly. These days, I almost never change any settings.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Thunderbird has tons of configurabilty. It's a Mozilla-spawned app,
not a GNOME-spawned app. And, who spends a lot of time configuring a mail
client? Set it up, point it at your mailbox, and you're done. Fire and
forget. I guess pedantic people would tweak their mail settings
periodically, so they'd want a pedantic client.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I know I mentioned vi keybindings,
but that bears repeating&mdash;there's
nothing quite like being able to manage the entire e-mail program strictly
from the keyboard and even have it do all the really heavy lifting for me.
There are configurable hooks for everything. So, if I want a particular
signature for my LUG e-mails and a different one for my friends, Mutt takes
care of it for me.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Vi keybindings, yeah yeah. I just showed my wife, Kelly, what Mutt
looks like. She said, &ldquo;Mutt looks like something I'd use on the Commodore
64. Kyle uses that? What's that about?&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> That's because it probably could run on a Commodore 64. Thunderbird's
RAM footprint couldn't even be <span   class="emphasis"><em>stored</em></span> on one.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I come back to your speed argument again. I just timed Thunderbird
starting up, checking mail in all folders and shutting down, and it took
six
seconds this time. That's not &ldquo;get up and go to the bathroom&rdquo; time, that's
barely a couple blinks. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> No, that happens if you ever want to do something like use Thunderbird
with local maildirs. The entire thing goes down the crapper.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> And <span   class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> would you want to do that? Store it all on the server. IMAP
for the win.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Hey, if your laptop is always
on-line, why not use Gmail? For me, I like
to be able to reference archived e-mail no matter what connection I have.
Mutt can handle just about any e-mail source you can throw at it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> If that's an issue, just set
Thunderbird to cache e-mail locally,
then. Configurability.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Then there's the mailing-list support. It's hard to beat Mutt for
managing multiple folders of mailing lists. It makes it easy to sort
through threads without thinking every IMAP folder is for a mailing list.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Thunderbird has a threaded reader mode.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Must be fun to set that every time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> It's a couple clicks. What do you have against a mouse?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I can type at almost 100 words per minute. I don't even know how to
manage mouse speed, but I know it's slower. Back to configurability,
managing PGP is a breeze with Mutt. You even can have it sign
and encrypt replies to encrypted messages automatically, or have it always encrypt
messages to particular people.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Managing PGP is easy with
Thunderbird too&mdash;simply add the Enigmail
plugin and configure it. It has all those features you mention.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> All of this support is built in. I
didn't have to grab any plugins,
and it still doesn't take up much RAM.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> And, it still looks like a Commodore 64 application and is
deliberately obtuse.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kyle:</b></span> Turn in your geek card now. All the geeks I know think looking like a
Commodore 64 application is a bonus&mdash;especially on my green-on-black
terminal.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Having a geek card is for geeks, man. You'll learn this when you
surpass &ldquo;system architect&rdquo; and become an &ldquo;IT
Manager&rdquo;. And I told you, 1989
called; they want their VT-100 back.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Ahhh, I see what happened. One step
into management, and Bill started
pointing and clicking at everything. Next thing you know, he'll be
complaining because he can't embed his PowerPoint presentation into the
body of his Thunderbird e-mail.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> Hey, even <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> dug the data-center calculator spreadsheet I came up
with. Fear my OpenOffice.org mojo. I seem to remember you wanting to learn
the formula-fu for that one. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Heh, I don't remember that part. I'd be too scared I'd wake up the
next morning with pointy hair.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> You have to have hair long enough to be pointy. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Back on topic, man. Another great
thing about Mutt is that it makes it
easy to check local mail on any server in your environment. It's much
better than installing X libs, or firing up less on /var/spool/mail/.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Now <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> is a point I will concede, which is why I do maintain a Mutt
instance on my colo'd server to access via ssh. But, I use it only about
once a year. And, every time I do, I feel the pain of the interface. Reminds
me of the first time I tried to use Debian's dselect program.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Do you remember when you had too many messages in your INBOX to
delete, and Thunderbird choked? I remember you asking me about my mutt-fu
then too.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bill:</b></span> No, that was Exchange's IMAP support choking, not Thunderbird. I have
more messages in my Zimbra mail, and it handles mass deletes just fine.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Ahh, yet another mail program, eh? Right. All I know is how quickly
Mutt churned through all of those e-mail messages.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Back to speed again. For a guy who drives a Honda, you're sure
obsessed with speed.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm more obsessed with efficiency than speed in both my car and my
mail client. What it ultimately comes down to is efficiency in the user
interface and RAM footprint, along with the fact that I can tweak just about
any setting I <span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> like. E-mail is just one of the many
things I deal with in a day, so I like to get in, get out and get on with
my work. The fact that I can access the same mail client on any computer
and even use it on each of my servers is a bonus. In conclusion, it has vi
keybindings. Enough said.
