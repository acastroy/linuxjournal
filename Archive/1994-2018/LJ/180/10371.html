I was surprised in a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> issue (January 2009) specifically
targeting security that the shell script article by Dave Taylor didn't
suggest a more secure method of creating temporary filenames other than just
using the $$ variable. Adding a little ${RANDOM} to the temp directory
name and filename, perhaps? Maybe he's going to address that in a later
article.

Dave Taylor replies:
Great point, Forrest. Since I have limited space in my column, I tend to
write short solutions rather than more complicated ones. You're right
that something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tempname="/tmp/appname.$$.${RANDOM}"
</pre>
</p><p>
works better than just a simple application of $$ in terms of
making it harder for a hacker to game your temporary files and potentially
alter the execution and results of system shell scripts.

In my opinion, the January 2009 Security issue was one of the best issues put out in a while, not that
the magazine isn't good, but you really outdid yourselves this time
in keeping the articles on focus with the focus of the issue. The one thing I
would have liked to see is if Cooking with Linux could have talked about
setting up home surveillance cameras in keeping with the Security theme or
something of the like. Although I always enjoy Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s articles, I'd
like to see him focus on some small-to-medium projects too instead of just
games.

Service</h4><p>
In the January 2009 issue, you have a nice article: &ldquo;Small Laptops
vs. Large Laptops&rdquo; by Kyle Rankin and Bill Childers.
Well, I've worked for several years as a consultant, and 
I
travel a lot, so I can understand the need for a big laptop and also can
understand the need and usefulness of a small laptop.
But, why not have the best of both worlds? First, I had a big 15" or 17" laptop,
and it was great, but then I had to travel, and it wasn't so nice to carry
nor was it usable on an airplane, so I bought a small Sony with an 11"
monitor. It was nice to have eight hours of battery life, but at the end
of the day I was tired, and my head hurt because of the effort 
to read all the tiny letters. The keyboard was too small, and I spent
much time using delete and backspace to correct my errors while programming
or writing documentation. So, I bought a 13" display laptop, once again from
Sony&mdash;an SZ series. 
Right now, I'm the happiest man in the world with my laptop. It's light (1.5kg),
fast, has 2.0MHz dual core and 4GB of RAM. It has a nice hybrid dual video card
(one Intel for extreme endurance on battery, and one NVIDIA for games and so
on).
Nowadays, I think we can have both worlds, being light
and small and at the same time, powerful and functional.

On another subject, some weeks ago I had a problem with my subscription for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, and I didn't get my favorite magazine. I contacted
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> support and
they were great. In a week, I had the missing issues (and I live in
Portugal). Here's something we all love: real support when you need it, and as
with Linux, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> gives you the best support. Keep up the excellent work!

Pedro, glad you liked Kyle and Bill's new Point/Counterpoint
column&mdash;see page 77 of this issue for more bickering.&mdash;Ed.

Further to Antoine's suggestion to Dave Taylor on reducing keystrokes [see
Letters in the January 2009 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>], note
that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline=$(( $RANDOM % 250 + 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
can be further simplified to be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline=$(( RANDOM % 250 + 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
It seems that all bash environment variables are expanded within the scope
of $(()).

Just wanted to drop y'all a line to voice my appreciation for
Point/Counterpoint. While Kyle vs. Bill did smack of a rap battle in a few
places, it was excellent nonetheless. Keep up the great work, guys!

The &ldquo;Go Green, Save Green with Linux&rdquo; article [by James Gray,
in the April 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>] carelessly misquotes an incompetently uttered sound
bite of Springboard Research: &ldquo;an average-sized server has the same carbon
footprint
as a mid-sized 4wd taking 17 litres of fuel to travel 100km&rdquo;, said Bob
Hayward, Research Vice President for Springboard Research.
His comment says nothing. Is he comparing a server to 17 liters of fuel?
or a 4wd? Or 100km, walking, flying, driving? 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> butchered this incomprehensible statement into the
ludicrous, saying a server has the same footprint as a 4WD vehicle!
This is business incompetence stacked on journalism incompetence.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jim Leuba  <br><br>
</p><p>
James Gray replies:
I personally find Hayward's quote ingenious, which does two things.
First, Hayward compares the energy consumption of two very different
machines: one whose energy consumption isn't readily apparent (the server)
to one that is more publicized (the vehicle).
Second, he shows that servers consume more energy than their compact size belies. Hayward's metric of energy consumption is the carbon
footprint, which is simply the quantity of carbon dioxide created by
the burning of fossil fuels in energy generation&mdash;pretty
straightforward stuff.
</p><p>
I can only speculate why you had such a strong emotional reaction to
Hayward's quote. My best guess is because it is hard for us human
beings to accept that our actions are directly and gravely degrading
the health of our planet. It's tough news to hear.

This is in reference to David Sinck's Tech Tip in the December 2008 issue. I find
the following code a little simpler and also insensitive to file
extensions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
case `file -b $1 | cut -d' ' -f1` in
  Zip|gzip) CAT=zcat ;;
  bzip2) CAT=bzcat ;;
  *) CAT=cat ;;
esac
$CAT $1
</pre>
</p><p>
As an aside, if one is looking to open the files in an editor, vim makes it
easy by opening zip files in various formats.
