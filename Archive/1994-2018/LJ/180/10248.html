Long-term monitoring with Munin is not restricted to system parameters.
Why not monitor data of personal interest or data of interest
to your colleagues?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde12a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The long-term monitoring tool Munin was developed in Norway, and
its name is derived from Norse mythology.
One of the two ravens who report the news of the world to the
god Odin is called Munin, and the other is named Hugin.
Munin is &ldquo;memory&rdquo;, and Hugin is &ldquo;thought&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The cool thing about the Munin long-term monitoring suite is that it's not restricted
to supervising only typical system and network parameters.
For example, you easily could do your colleagues
from the marketing department a favor and monitor product
sales for them. All you need to do is to write a script or program in the
language of your choice that returns the current value of the monitored
parameter in the form <tt  >&lt;parameter&gt;.value
&lt;value&gt;</tt> (ending with a newline
character) on the standard output.
</p><p>
It's a little less trivial to understand how Munin actually works. This
is because older parts of the official documentation
(including the source code written in Perl) claim that Munin was a
client-server application, which has caused much confusion. More recently,
the Munin developers have referred to it as having a master-node
architecture,
which is far more appropriate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde1618"></a>
A Master to Collect, Store and Present Data</h2></div></div><p>
To use the monitoring software, you need a machine that hosts a Web server
and has Tobias Oetiker's RRDtool installed. On this computer, you run
your Munin central, the Munin master. Debian and Ubuntu users will find
it in the munin package. It consists of a set of Perl scripts to be
run by the cron d&aelig;mon in five-minute intervals. These scripts collect
data from several Munin nodes, archive them in round-robin databases
(RRDs),
generate diagrams and update the Web pages that present them. One of
them, dubbed munin-limits, also warns about values that violate limits,
if configured accordingly.
</p><p>
RRDs have the advantage of never changing size. As
time goes by, older data is squashed and stored in less detail until it
finally phases out completely. Munin uses RRDs that store the data from
the past 48 hours in five-minute resolution. Average values for the past
ten days
are stored with a resolution of half an hour;
average values for the past 46 days are stored with a resolution of two hours,
and average values for the past 449 days are stored with a resolution of
one day.
</p><p>
The Munin master reads the munin.conf configuration file usually placed
in /etc/ (under Debian/Ubuntu, /etc/munin/munin.conf) to find out
where to ask for data and under which (host)name it should appear in
the Web interface. A typical configuration entry looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Airport;localhost.localdomain]
    address 127.0.0.1
    use_node_name yes
</pre>
</p><p>
In brackets, you put the name of the machine to be monitored (here,
localhost.localdomain). If you use a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN),
Munin automatically will present this machine as a member of a group named
after the given domain part. If you prefer to use your own groups, add
the relevant group name in front of the machine name in brackets (here,
Airport; the result is shown in Figure 1).
</p><p>
Make sure you use a semicolon as the delimiter, without any whitespaces
before and after, and decide on the group name before you start
monitoring. This will make life easier for you, as Munin uses the
group name as the name of the directory that contains the round-robin databases and the diagrams (in our example, on an Ubuntu system,
/var/www/munin/Airport/).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10248f1.large.jpg"><img src="10248f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Munin's main page presents all plugins ordered by group
and, within a group, by hostname. Categories available for each host
are presented in brackets.
</p></div></div><p>
The filenames of the databases and diagrams contain the hostname given
in brackets. If you change the content of the brackets afterward,
make sure to change file and directory names accordingly (and before
the next five-minute interval is over); otherwise, Munin will use new
empty RRDs, and you may lose data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde1ae8"></a>
From Where to Obtain Data?</h2></div></div><p>
Use the address parameter to specify the Internet address from which the
Munin master obtains the relevant data. This allows you to
use an intermediate slave machine to gather data from the actual target
machines without giving misleading information in the Munin Web
interface.
</p><p>
What seems to complicate matters at first glance is actually a very useful
feature, as it allows you to restrict the plain-text communication of
the Munin protocol to trusted machines. In addition, you do not always have
the opportunity to install the Munin node software on the actual target
machine. This is, for example, the case if a Munin node gathers data
via SNMP. In this case, you must set the use_node_name parameter to no.
</p><p>
On each machine given as the value for an address parameter, you need 
to install the Munin node software; otherwise, the Web pages generated by
the Munin master will remain empty. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, the relevant
package is called munin-node.
</p><p>
The Munin node consists of a d&aelig;mon that, on request from the Munin
master,
starts the plugins responsible for collecting their specific type of
data. Its configuration file, munin-node.conf, is stored in the same
directory as the munin.conf; don't confuse the two if your Munin
master runs on a machine that also acts as a node. munin-node.conf
defines, among other things, the log file and log level, the port to be used (usually
4949), and most important, the machines that are allowed to connect
to the d&aelig;mon:


<pre     class="programlisting">
allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, the regular expression <tt  >^127\.0\.0\.1$</tt> restricts access
to the Munin master running on the same machine, localhost.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde1e58"></a>
First Contact via Telnet</h2></div></div><p>
Installing the Munin node from a distribution package usually
will activate a range of plugins that can be configured automatically. In
this case, Telnetting to port 4949 of the node machine will give you
an overview:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet localhost 4949
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
$ munin node at extrablatt.trish.de
help
$ Unknown command. Try list, nodes, config, fetch, version or quit
list
  open_inodes         if_err_eth0  irqstats
  entropy             processes    postfix_mailqueue
  if_eth0 df          netstat      interrupts

fetch open_inodes
used.value 67839
max.value 68094
.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>
</p><p>
The list command returns the names of all activated plugins on this
particular node. The fetch command, with the name of the plugin you want
to run as an argument, returns the values of the parameters (in this case,
used and max) the plugin monitors. As long as you
don't change the timeout directive in munin-node.conf (for example,
to 20 seconds: <tt  >timeout 20</tt>), you have to be fast to
type in your commands,
as the d&aelig;mon will close the connection after a default of ten seconds.
</p><p>
If the list command does not list any plugins (which might be the case
after a source code installation), you need to activate them first. To
do this, symlink them into the plugins directory (/etc/munin/plugins
on Debian/Ubuntu) on the node machine and restart the d&aelig;mon using its
init script. The command <tt  >munin-node-configure
--shell</tt> will show you
link commands for some of the plugins provided with the distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde2170"></a>
Wild-Card and autoconf Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
There are two types of plugins. For plugins that are independent
of additional parameters, the link name equals the plugin name. Sometimes,
however, a plugin can monitor several items of the same type, for example,
several network interfaces, such as eth0 and eth1.
</p><p>
In this case, it would be stupid to hard-code the interface name into
the plugin. Instead, you provide this information in the name of the
symlink. Plugins capable of this are called wild-card plugins, and their names
end with an underscore. If you, for example, want to monitor the eth0
interface with the wild-card plugin if_, the link pointing to the if_
plugin would be if_eth0:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -al /etc/munin/plugins/if_eth*
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 28 2008-06-27 23:53
 &#8618;/etc/munin/plugins/if_eth0 -&gt; /usr/share/munin/plugins/if_

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 28 2008-06-27 23:53
 &#8618;/etc/munin/plugins/if_eth1 -&gt; /usr/share/munin/plugins/if_
</pre>
</p><p>
Almost all plugins provided with the Munin distribution belong to the
plugin family auto and can be run with the autoconf argument. In this
case, they check whether they are able to provide meaningful results.
For example, running a monitoring plugin for the Exim MTA makes sense
only if you're running the Exim mail server. If your system does not fulfill
the prerequisites to run a specific autoconf-enabled plugin, it will
provide you with meaningful hints:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ /usr/share/munin/plugins/exim_mailqueue autoconf
no (exim not found)
</pre>
</p><p>
To get an overview of all preinstalled plugins that implement the
autoconf method, simply run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# munin-node-configure --suggest
Plugin                     | Used | Suggestions
------                     | ---- | -----------
[...]
exim_mailqueue             | no   | [exim not found]
[...]
if_                        | yes  |
[...]
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to share your own plugins with others, for example, at the
Munin Exchange platform, we recommend you have a look at the officially
provided plugins to see how the autoconf method is implemented. But,
to get started with your own plugins, don't complicate your life
unnecessarily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde25e8"></a>
Fly Away</h2></div></div><p>
As an example, let's monitor the departures at Munich
Airport in five-minute intervals, as that is the default for
the Munin cron job. The departure timetable is available 
from a Web page, and we can use a shell script and the Links text browser
to dump it into a temporary file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

SITE=http://www.munich-airport.de
DEP_URL=$SITE/en/consumer/fluginfo/abflug/index.jsp?viewType=t
TMP_FILE=/tmp/.muc_flights

links -dump $DEP_URL &gt; $TMP_FILE
</pre>
</p><p>
This file now contains lines like these:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[...]
 [ LH 3464 ] [ Budapest ]   [ 21:30 ] [  ]   [ T2 ]   [ departed ]
 [ LH  726 ] [ Shanghai ]   [ 21:30 ] [  ]   [ T2 ]   [ boarding ]
[...]
</pre>
</p><p>
The Web page lists five flight states: calling, boarding,
departed, planned (which means delayed) and cancelled. We will
count them for the current time interval and return them on the standard
output, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
calling.value 0
boarding.value 1
departed.value 1
planned.value 0
cancelled.value 0
</pre>
</p><p>
To determine the current time, we could use the following date command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date +%H:%M
21:30
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde2a08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and grep for this string in the &ldquo;links&rdquo; dump. Unfortunately,
matters are a bit more complicated. The airport's
departure timetable lists all flights in five-minute slots. But, even
though the cron job on the Munin master is configured to run at zero, five,
ten (and so on) minutes past the hour, we can't be sure it will run exactly on time.
That's why our plugin uses a modulo operation (executed by
bc) to round down the current minutes accordingly and combine hour
and minutes in a case construction:

<pre     class="programlisting">
TIME=$(date +%H)
MIN=$(echo "($(date +%M)/5)*5"|bc)
case $MIN in
    0) TIME=$TIME:00   ;;
    5) TIME=$TIME:05   ;;
    *) TIME=$TIME:$MIN ;;
esac
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the TIME variable contains only hour:minute pairs in which the
minutes are a multiple of five.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xde2c18"></a>
Stop Interpolating!</h2></div></div><p>
There's another complication&mdash;when the Munin master stores the values
retrieved from the plugin in the relevant RRDs at a point in time
deviating from the exact planned time that RRDtool interpolates them. This
way the database rarely contains the integer values our plugin returns
but slightly deviating floating-point values.
</p><p>
The good news is that RRDtool accepts time value pairs. In this case,
it will refrain from interpolation. The time must be given in seconds
since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC as a prefix of the value. A colon (:)
is used as the delimiter, as in the following example plugin output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
calling.value 1230841800:0
boarding.value 1230841800:1
departed.value 1230841800:1
planned.value 1230841800:0
cancelled.value 1230841800:0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xdd9660"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(1230841800 equals January 1, 2009, 21:30.) Note that
Munin versions before 1.3.4 were unable to handle plugin output using
this extended format. This means the following plugin code won't be
compatible with older Munin versions:


<pre     class="programlisting">
links -dump $DEP_URL | grep $TIME &gt; $TMP_FILE

UNIXTIME=$(date -d$TIME:00 +%s)
echo "calling.value $UNIXTIME:$(grep calling $TMP_FILE | wc -l)"
echo "boarding.value $UNIXTIME:$(grep boarding $TMP_FILE | wc -l)"
echo "departed.value $UNIXTIME:$(grep departed $TMP_FILE | wc -l)"
echo "planned.value $UNIXTIME:$(grep planned $TMP_FILE | wc -l)"
echo "cancelled.value $UNIXTIME:$(grep cancelled $TMP_FILE | wc -l)"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xdd9818"></a>
The config Method</h2></div></div><p>
Apart from the output to be generated when the plugin is run without
further arguments, all plugins are required to implement a config method,
which is executed when the plugin is run with the config string as
an argument. If we name our script muc (the abbreviation for Munich
Airport) and start it from the directory where it is located, it might,
for example, produce the following output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./muc config
graph_title Departures Munich Airport
graph_vlabel Number
graph_args --base 1000 --lower-limit 0
graph_category Departures
calling.label Calling
calling.draw AREA
boarding.label Boarding
boarding.draw STACK
departed.label Departed
departed.draw STACK
planned.label Late
planned.draw LINE2
cancelled.label Cancelled
cancelled.draw LINE2
</pre>
</p><p>
Each time the Munin master asks the Munin node d&aelig;mon to run a plugin
using the fetch command (as presented in the Telnet session above),
it also executes the
config method in order to find out how it should display the data
in the diagram. In this example, the graph should be titled &ldquo;Departures
Munich Airport&rdquo; (Figure 2), and the y-axis should be labeled
&ldquo;Number&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10248f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Departures from Munich Airport, January 2, 2009
</p></div></div><p>
The graph_args variable allows the plugin to forward arguments to the
RRDtool graphing routine (see the rrdgraph man page). Forwarding the
option <tt  >--base 1000</tt>, the muc plugin ensures that a k (kilo) unit
prefix as displayed in the graph equals 1000, not 1024. The <tt  >-lower-limit
0</tt> influences RRDtool's autoscaling. It makes sure that the displayed
y-axis always will range at least from 0.
</p><p>
The graph_category tells the Munin master in which category (Figure
1) the relevant diagrams are to be displayed. This allows you to group
diagrams in a logical way. The diagrams of plugins that do not specify
the graph_category variable can be found in the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; category. The
muc data will be presented in our own new category titled Departures.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xdd9df0"></a>
How Individual Parameters Are Displayed</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to these variables related to the entire graph, you also can
specify details for each parameter the plugin monitors, so in the case
of the muc plugin, calling, boarding, departed, planned and
cancelled. The <tt  >&lt;parameter&gt;.label</tt> variable sets the legend entry
for <tt  >&lt;parameter&gt;</tt>.
</p><p>
<tt  >&lt;parameter&gt;.draw</tt> specifies the type of diagram
the <tt  >&lt;parameter&gt;</tt>
data is to be presented as. <tt  >AREA</tt> asks the Munin master to draw the
relevant curve and fill the entire area between the x-axis and data point
with color. Parameter data of the drawing type STACK will be stacked
on top of this basic area. This way, we sum up all flights that, in the
current five-minute interval, are labeled calling, boarding and
departed. The airport timetable won't correct their departure time
later; they all count as dispatched at this point of time.
</p><p>
Flights tagged as planned and cancelled behave differently. For delayed
flights, the Munich Airport authorities will issue a new departure time
later. This way, the plugin will see planned flights twice:
as planned within their time slot according to schedule, and as
calling, boarding or departed at their actual time interval of
departure. That's why we draw delayed flights in a separate line of the
type LINE2. The number denotes the thickness of the line in pixels. A
LINE1 line is one pixel thick; a LINE2 line is two pixels, and a LINE3 line
is 
three pixels. Cancelled flights won't reappear in the time schedule,
but as they will never depart, we also draw them as a separate line of
two pixels thick.
</p><p>
All this plugin output is written to the standard output. The
final version of our muc script is shown in Listing 1.

    rm $TMP_FILE
fi
</pre></div><p>
To activate the muc plugin, we simply create a symlink in the plugins
directory and restart the Munin d&aelig;mon:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# ln -s &lt;path/to/&gt;muc /etc/munin/plugins
# /etc/init.d/munin-node restart

</pre>
</p><p>
By Telnetting from the Munin master machine to port 4949 of the node machine
on which we have activated the muc plugin, we can check whether all is
well. Let's see if our config method works:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet localhost 4949
[...]
config muc
graph_title Departures Munich Airport
graph_vlabel Number
[...]
cancelled.label Cancelled
cancelled.draw LINE2
</pre>
</p><p>
If we can do this by hand, the Munin master should generate some
nice little graphs and present them via the Web, as shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10248f3.large.jpg"><img src="10248f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Munin creates daily, weekly, monthly and annual graphs. If
you want to preserve them for later comparison, you can write a cron job
that archives the relevant PNGs and/or RRD databases at certain points
of time.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce9580.0xdda790"></a>
Drawbacks</h2></div></div><p>
The simple way to write and integrate custom plugins is one of the
huge advantages of Munin&mdash;even the more complex wild-card plugins are no
big deal.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, simple sometimes also means simplistic. Although it is
possible to include Munin-generated diagrams in customized Web pages, Munin
does not provide any functionality to customize the Web pages generated
by the Munin master. Especially on sites with many hosts and plugins to
monitor, the simple approach that combines all daily and weekly graphs
in one page results in an extremely slow-loading overview page.
</p><p>
Another example of a rigid approach in the Munin architecture is
the fixed resolution of data. Not all data changes fast enough that the
five-minute interval is appropriate.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, a configuration option for individual plugins remains an
item on the wish list.
On the other hand, Munin allows quite powerful configuration for
plugins by means of environment variables set in the
