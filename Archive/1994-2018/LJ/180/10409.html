Enough with the cloud nonsense. Sure, you can buy
in to some big commercial cloud, but odds are you've already got one of
your own. Why not take advantage of it and get yourself backed
up safely?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b48580.0x1c40460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Our guests will be here any moment, Fran&ccedil;ois. What have you done
with
all the tables and chairs on the patio? Yes, I guessed you moved
them to make room, which brings me to my second question. What are all
these model rockets doing out here on the patio? Wait a minute. Are
those USB Flash drives I see taped to the rocket bodies? Why, in the name
of all that is free and open, are you planning to launch all those Flash
drives? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> What do you mean, you are doing what I
asked you to do?
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> When I asked you to back up the restaurant's
machines
to our cloud, I didn't mean actual clouds. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>cloud</em></span> is
just a fancy
word for somebody else's network or network resources. More accurately,
a cloud is a kind of marketing term to describe computing or storage
resources provided by a vendor over the Internet. I was using the term in
jest, partly because people seem rather obsessed with running their
operating systems in the cloud, backing up their servers to the cloud
and so on. The restaurant's network isn't on par with Google or Amazon,
but we have plenty of storage space, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>.
I see our guests arriving. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois!
Inside!
</p><p>
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>,
where exquisite
wines are paired with the finest in Linux and open-source software. Please,
take your seats and make yourselves comfortable while Fran&ccedil;ois
cleans up
his model rockets. We have a lovely 2006 Kim Crawford SP Flowers Sauvignon
Blanc from New Zealand&mdash;a full-bodied dry white with intense flavor
and
a long finish...unforgettable. Fran&ccedil;ois, take those rockets to the
cellar and return with the wine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci, mon ami</em></span>.
</p><p>
While my faithful waiter fetches the wine, I probably should tell
you that all those model rockets were an attempt at a cloud backup
solution. There are, of course, numerous backup solutions you can
use, from the simple and free to the complex and expensive, as well
as everything in between. The technology behind most backup systems,
however, tends to be much more limited. Using classic tools, such as
tar and gzip, to back up and compress is still very
common under the surface of much more complex tools. This is true even
when using network resources. In the end, you are backing up from one
machine to another. Many people I know, including those with small
businesses, do
this for their regular backups. Machine A backs to machine B, which backs
to C, which backs to A. The machines, and their drives, are all part of
a network. Hey, instant cloud, and you probably didn't know you had one.
</p><p>
This is where rsync, another popular backup tool, shows its
worth. As the name implies, rsyncs keep a backup copy of your data, in
sync with the original. It can do it locally, from one physical drive
to another, or across your network. Because only those files that have
been modified are transferred, the process can be very quick. You can
do this with single files, whole directories and subdirectories, while
maintaining file ownership and permissions, links, symbolic links and
so on. rsync has its own transport, or you can use OpenSSH to secure
the transfer, and (of course) there are some great front-end, graphical
tools to make the process a little slicker.
</p><p>
You can find rsync at <a href="http://rsync.samba.org" target="_self">rsync.samba.org</a>, but you
probably don't
even have to look that far. Many distributions load it when
you install your system. If not, check your installation disks or simply
pick it up from your distribution's repositories. Before I explain how
to rsync your data to your own personal cloud, let me show you how easy
it is to create a synchronized backup of your data from one directory
to another (or one drive to another):


<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync -av important_stuff/ is_backup
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, rsync copies everything in the
directory important_stuff into another directory (or folder)
called is_backup. Most of you will have figured out that the
-v means verbose copy. The -a option hides some amount
of complexity in that it is the same as using the -rlptgoD flags. In
order, this means that rsync should do a recursive copy; copy symbolic
links; preserve permissions, modification times and group and owner
information; and, with the final D, copy special files (device and
block). When you press Enter, files go scrolling by, after which you
see something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

CookingJul08.tgz

total size is 46044132  speedup is 1.00
</pre>
</p><p>
One other thing that rsync should be able to do in order to be
completely useful is delete files. If you are mirroring files and
directories, it stands to reason that you want the mirror to represent
exactly what is on the original. If files have been deleted, you want them
deleted on the backup server as well. This is where the --delete
parameter comes into play. Using the earlier example, let's delete that tgz
file from the original, then relaunch the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rsync -av --delete important_stuff/ is_backup
sending incremental file list
./
deleting CookingJul08.tgz

sent 4164 bytes  received 25 bytes  8378.00 bytes/sec
total size is 41911050  speedup is 10005.03
</pre>
</p><p>
From here on, both directories will always be in sync. When doing
network backups, this magic synchronization of files and directories is
done using a client and server setup. At least one machine must play the
role of server (although nothing is stopping you from running an rsync
d&aelig;mon on
every one of your machines). The server gets its information about who can
access what from a configuration file called rsyncd.conf. You'll
find that it probably lives in the /etc directory. The following partial
listing is from one of my rsync servers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hosts allow = 192.168.1.0/24
use chroot = no
max connections = 10
log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log
gid = nogroup
uid = nobody

[marcel]
    path = /media/bigdrive/backups/marcel
    read only = no
    comment = Marcel's files
[francois]
    path = /media/bigdrive/backups/francois
    read only = no
    comment = Files for the waiter
</pre>
</p><p>
This configuration file is quite simple once you get the hang of it. Backup
areas are identified by a name in square brackets (marcel, website,
francois and so on). The chief bits of information there include the path
to the disk area and some kind of comment. Notice that I specified
<tt  >read only = no</tt>,
but I could just as easily have added that to the top section (the one
without a name in square brackets). That's the global section. Anything
put up there applies to all other sections, but it can be overridden. Pay
particular attention to the gid and uid values; these are the group ID and
user ID to which the file transfer takes place. The default is nobody,
but you need to make sure that is correct for your system. One of
my servers does not have a nobody group, but has a nogroup group instead.
</p><p>
The hosts allow section identifies my local subnet as being the only
set of addresses from which transfers can take place. The log file
line identifies a file to log information from the d&aelig;mon. You
also can specify a maximum number of connections, specific users who are
allowed to transfer files (auth users) and a whole lot more. Run
<tt  >man rsyncd.conf</tt> for the full details.
When your configuration is set,
you can launch the rsync d&aelig;mon, which, interestingly enough, is
exactly the same program as the rsync command itself. Just do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync --daemon
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. Now, it's time to put this setup to use. You might want
to test your rsync connection by issuing the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync remote_host::
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the double colon at the end of the server's name. The result
should be something like this, assuming a server called thevault:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rsync thevault::
website     All our websites
francois    Files for the waiter
marcel      Backup area for Marcel
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, pretend I am on the server where my Web site files live. Using
the following command, I can launch rsync to back up this entire area:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync -av /var/www thevault::website/

building file list ...
</pre>
</p><p>
The format of the rsync command is <tt  >rsync options source
destination</tt>, which means I also could start the command from
thevault,
assuming my Web site machine also was running an rsync d&aelig;mon. The
result would look more like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync -av localbackupdir websitemachine.dom::websites
</pre>
</p><p>
All this work at the command line is great, but there are some
tools for making the process easier, particularly if you will be
creating a number of rsync backups or if you want to get into more complex
requirements, such as scheduled backups. A friendly graphical front end
on your desktop also may be a greater incentive to perform regular
backups or take a quick backup when you've added important data and a
&ldquo;right now&rdquo; backup is desirable. The first tool I want to show
you is Piero Orsoni's grsync (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10409f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. grsync
provides an easy-to-use interface with every rsync option you could
want.
</p></div></div><p>
While providing a great front end to rsync, grsync also works as a
teaching tool for the command-line version of the program, or at least it
helps as a
memory aid. Almost any command-line option available to rsync is
covered in one of these three tabs: Basic options, Advanced options
and Extra options. What makes it a learning tool is that if you pause
over any of those check boxes with your mouse, a tooltip appears showing
the command-line option with a brief description of its function.
</p><p>
To start, click the Add button next to the session drop-down dialog
and enter a name for your backup. You can define many different rsync
backups here, and then launch them again at a later time. Clicking the
Browse
button brings up the standard Gtk2 file browser window from which you
can select your local and destination folders. Unfortunately, you can't
browse remote systems, but if you've already set up an rsync server, have
no fear. You can enter it manually in the format I showed you earlier
(for example, <tt  >thevault::marcel/</tt>). When you are happy
with the various
options, click Execute. If you only <span   class="emphasis"><em>think</em></span> you are
happy, click
the Simulation button. (Chef Marcel loves a program with a sense of
humor.) When you do click Execute, the program switches to a progress
window (Figure 2), so you can see where you are in the process.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10409f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Once
your grsync backup begins, it switches to a progress report view.
</p></div></div><p>
The next item on our rsync menu is Magnus Loef's
GAdmin-Rsync. GAdmin-Rsync makes every aspect of creating an rsync
backup a matter of filling in the blanks. What's more, the program creates
backups using SSH by default, which means you can set up rsync backups
to any machine to which you have secure shell access. This also means
you don't actually need to have an rsync d&aelig;mon running on the
remote machine if you have SSH access. Let me show you how it works.
</p><p>
When you start the program for the first time, you'll be asked for
a name to give your new backup (Figure 3). You could back up the
entire system or select specific folders of filesystems. Choose a name
that makes sense to you based on what you want to back up. Enter a name,
then click Apply to continue.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10409f3.large.jpg"><img src="10409f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. GAdmin-Rsync
lets you define numerous backup configurations, each with its own
identifier.
</p></div></div><p>
As you saw when we did this at the command line, rsync backups can
be local, to a remote system or from a remote system. The next window
looks for that very information (Figure 4). By default, local
backup is checked. To back up to a remote server, select Local to remote
backup. Because you can swap source and destination easily when using
rsync, there's that third option. I routinely use a remote to local
backup for my Web sites and remote systems. Click Forward to continue.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10409f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Your next step is to define the location of the backup.
</p></div></div><p>
Assuming you chose to back up to your cloud, your next step is
to enter the server information (Figure 5). This includes the
backup path on your networked server as well as your SSH key type and
length. When you have entered this information, click Forward.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10409f5.large.jpg"><img src="10409f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. For remote backups, GAdmin-Rsync uses SSH/SCP for secure
transfers.
</p></div></div><p>
Now you're ready to start the rsync backup. Click the Backup Progress
tab to watch all the action.
</p><p>
What is nice about this program is that you can (as with grsync) store a
number of backup definitions, so you can choose to back up your documents,
music or digital photographs when it suits you. GAdmin-Rsync
goes further though. If you take a look down at the bottom of the 
window on the Backup settings tab, you'll notice the words &ldquo;Schedule
this backup to run at specific days via cron&rdquo; and a check box
(Figure
6). Check the box, then scroll down to choose the days you want the backup
to run. A little further down, you can specify the time as well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10409f6.large.jpg"><img src="10409f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. GAdmin-Rsync also provides an easy way to schedule your backups
with
cron.
</p></div></div><p>
Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, closing time has caught up to us, and
at
least for now, time is one thing we can't back up. Despite the hour,
I am quite sure we can convince Fran&ccedil;ois to refill our glasses
one final time before we go our separate ways. Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
raise your glasses and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
