On progress toward dislodging Microsoft's biggest enterprise lock-in.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1458580.0x1550358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More than five years ago, Linux-friendly IT executives told me
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7414" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7414</a>) there was
one Microsoft product that was not only highly entrenched but appealing as
well: Exchange Server. &ldquo;We can easily see our way to replacing Microsoft
Office and even Microsoft Windows&rdquo;, one executive told me. &ldquo;But we can't get
along without Exchange. If you're looking for Microsoft's real lock-in with
enterprise customers, Exchange is it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That was then, but what about now? Recently, I asked readers on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site how they'd replace Exchange.
</p><p>
Zimbra came up big:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;Zimbra is open source (though not free software) and has a feature set that
is on par with and sometimes even exceeds Exchange. If you are not running
an MS-only shop, Zimbra is the best alternative.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Zimbra is extremely good, though not light on resources, and it requires
a dedicated server to run. It does work flawlessly with free clients like
Thunderbird and Evolution while having good support for Outlook.
The downside is that it is not completely free (the YPL is open source, but
entirely free).&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Zimbra, hands down. If you're looking for an open-source alternative to
Exchange, one of the most important things to look at is the community. The
Zimbra community on the forums is awesome, and the Zimbra staff really pay
attention to what we as the community say.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;I also have used Zimbra (free) for my other gigs, and it has worked
well,
but the packaging of Zimbra is not very desirable.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;I love Zimbra, as it has a cohesive PIM suite that simply and seamlessly
syncs with my mobile devices.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;We switched to the Zimbra Open Source version, and it is working quite
well. There was some initial resistance from users, but that has largely
dissipated over a couple months of use.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Zimbra (Network Edition, not the free/OSS edition) gives full Outlook
integration and probably works just as good as Exchange, functionality-wise. Unfortunately, for my customers (very small business), Zimbra's
pricing is not up to par, and compared to Windows SBS pricing, even way too
expensive. But, I guess for enterprise environments, it's a very good
option.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Zimbra is probably the best open-source enterprise e-mail/collaboration
product on the market.&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There was some support for Google Apps:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;Google Apps does not have the high degree of client seamlessness that
Zimbra has: Web, complete Outlook (PIM, Filters, GAL, etc.), Zimbra Desktop,
iPhone/WAP, OTA ActiveSync and so on.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;We're small (20-person software company), but we dropped Exchange
about two
years ago in favor of Google Apps. We lost seamless contact and calendar
sync on some mobile phones in the office, but we gained a bunch of time
from our IT administrator (that was otherwise spent administering
Exchange). We gained a great deal of stability and reliability, and we
gained all the benefits of Google Mail.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Google uses Gmail. Doesn't everybody?&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;...just throw away Exchange and use Google Apps/Docs/Mail, as many
businesses do. Google Apps are so much better!&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Our university, including our medical school and hospital, went with
Google,
and it has been a big success.&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
IBM Lotus Domino/Notes was endorsed for big enterprises, but not without
respect for Exchange:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;We've installed IBM Lotus Domino/Notes at a dozen small (10&ndash;100 users)
businesses. Its versatility is awesome. It's <span   class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span> much
more than e-mail.
It's rock solid. We run servers on SUSE, Red Hat and Windows. We run clients
on Windows, Mac and, yes, Linux! <span   class="emphasis"><em>And</em></span> the pricing is so very
affordable.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;I used to work for a multinational (100,000+ employees) consumer goods
company who used Notes/Domino, then was moved to Big Blue who also used
Notes/Domino. I now work for a much smaller bank (6,000 employees) that uses
Outlook/Exchange. Experience has shown that larger companies with massive
user bases tend to use Domino, as it just scales better than Exchange used
to. Microsoft has put a lot of effort into making sure Exchange is more
robust and that it scales better....Having used both, my preference is for
the Notes/Domino combination, as I miss having my workspace.&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Citadel got props:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;...you really want to take a look at
Citadel. Although it looks nothing like Exchange, it solves many of the
same problems (e-mail, calendars, address books) and some new ones (instant
messenger, chat, forums and more), and it does so in a way that is more
intuitive. Many who try it soon find that they can't live without
it.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;We use www.citadel.org. It is open source, free, rock solid and well
supported. Now we have 50 accounts (but 40GB of indexed
mail).&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Scalix (along with some of the others in some cases) got mixed reviews:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;I used Scalix at the last company I worked
for and liked it a lot.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Scalix is not open source, and the Community version is seriously broken
(no CalDAV, etc.).&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;OX/Scalix/Zimbra are bloated and pretend to be open
source.&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Others: Kolab, Dovecot, Gordano, Bynari, Postfix+dovecot+chandler-server,
Axigen, Communigate, Mailtrust, Novell Groupwise, OpenExchange, Zafara, Sun
suites. There was no mention of Scalable OpenGroupware.org, which Francis
Lachapelle and Ludovic Marcotte
reviewed in April 2008.
</p><p>
So the challenge remains. Any bets on how long it will take to finish the
job?
