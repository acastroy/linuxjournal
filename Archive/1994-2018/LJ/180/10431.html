As a system administrator, it reassures me when I see the computer systems
break in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> episodes. The reason it brings me peace of mind is that
I know if I perfect human cloning and mind transfer, my sysadmin skills
still will be useful in a few thousand years. Also, I'm fairly certain
Data (the android Lieutenant) must be running some sort of embedded Linux, so my particular skill set will be very much in demand.
</p><p>
I'm getting a little ahead of myself, however. Although I'm sure
system administration will be a popular topic in future millennia, with
this issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, you hold the future in your hands right now.
Cheesy anecdotes aside, this month we have tons of articles and columns to
help you keep the packets flowing.
</p><p>
Because most system administration begins with installing an operating
system, it seems appropriate to start there. We've got a couple really
interesting articles this month that deal with both system installing and
system restoring. Bill Childers tells us how to leverage PXE network
booting to install operating systems (even Windows!) by using a remote
booted Linux kernel. Once you understand the nuances of PXE booting,
it's amazing the things you can do without even a local boot device.
Add to that Christina Barrado and Sebastian Galiano's article on
FreeBoo, and you'll be able to install, restore and dual boot in no
time (or at least, in less time than with conventional methods). FreeBoo is an
open-source alternative to programs like Rembo. Using PXE and FreeBoo
will make booting and restoring multiple operating systems much easier than
ever before.
</p><p>
Once your systems are up and running, it's the system
administrator's job to keep them that way. Applications such as Munin
can keep track of long-term trends. In fact, Munin can keep track of more
than just system logs, and Patricia Jung tells us all about it. Whether
you use Munin, or you just grep system logs, when the inevitable problem
comes along, it's important to know what to do. And, Kyle Rankin explains
how to salvage a hard drive when the mysterious Master Boot Record fails.
Thankfully, he goes into a little more detail than the standard Windows
answer. Sometimes, <tt  >fdisk /mbr</tt> isn't enough. GRUB is a bit
more robust than that, thank you very much.
</p><p>
Victor Burns shows us an intriguing new method for dual booting between
Linux and Solaris. No, I'm not talking about full virtualization or
standard dual booting, I'm talking about running both at the same time.
With Solaris-Zones, you really can have the best of both worlds. Speaking
of both worlds, Bill and Kyle hash it out again this month. This time,
it's with e-mail clients. I won't say Bill is GUI, but he sure
prefers it in an e-mail client.
</p><p>
If you add our regular cast of columnists to this issue, you'll see
it's quite a great month to be a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> subscriber. Mick Bauer
shows us how to set up the Squid Web proxy securely. Dave Taylor hones our
scripting skills, and Marcel Gagn&eacute; shows us one of the most important
things a system administrator can do&mdash;back up. If you're not a
sysadmin, don't worry about being left out this
month. Even though we all need to administer our own systems to
some degree, we've also got information that will appeal to those
readers without racks of servers to manage.
</p><p>
Mike Diehl teaches us how to program using Irrlicht to get some awesome 3-D
graphics in our programs. Reuven M. Lerner shows us how to write plugins
for jQuery. Plus, we have tech tips, new product information and news from
the Linux industry that is bound to tickle the fancy of any Penguin fan.
</p><p>
Perhaps none of us might be around when it's time to do tech support
for Galaxy-class starships. It's unlikely we'll be able to debug
code for a holodeck any time soon. And, to be honest, I don't expect to
get a call requesting my help in programming any interstellar guidance
systems. I think it's a fair guess, however, that when the time does
come, most of the devices will be running the Linux kernel. If we
practice now, perhaps we'll be ready if the time comes sooner than I
expect. Or, if we get visited in a time-travel episode. Admittedly though,
the latter is probably unlikely.
