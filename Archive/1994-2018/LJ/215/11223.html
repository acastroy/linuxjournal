How can you value something that isn't scarce and costs nothing?

In the midst of a long thread on the ProjectVRM list, Joe Andrieu wrote
this summary statement about economics and markets: &ldquo;Economics is about
allocating limited resources. The market is a mechanism for discovering
prices.&rdquo; He then added, &ldquo;You can allocate other ways, of
course.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Although one might argue those definitions, they do explain why Linux, along
with the rest of free software and open source, gets little attention in
economics discussions and little credit for influence on markets&mdash;mostly because it allocates in other ways.
</p><p>
Chief among those is use. Linux strives to be useful. But kernel
development doesn't happen in userspace, which is where economics and
markets live. It happens in kernel space, which is boring, unless you're a
contributor to it or you depend on keeping up with what's happening there.
</p><p>
Even though the only code I know is Morse, I often find reassuring the
constant hum of progress coming off the Linux Kernel Mailing List
(<a href="http://lkml.org" target="_self">lkml.org</a>). The latest post today (January 4, 2012, as I write this) concerns a
patch for better low memory handling from Mike Waychison. The hottest
message is one from Greg KH announcing the Linux 3.1.7 release, which has a
single bugfix for resume issues, and which he says you won't need if those
issues aren't yours.
</p><p>
Maybe it's just that I spent too much of my life in marketing and,
therefore, love too much the sound of its absence, but I find in that kind
of talk a reassurance that something right is going on in the world.
</p><p>
Or, maybe it's just that the instruction programmed into my head by my old-school
parents&mdash;&ldquo;make yourself useful&rdquo;&mdash;remains a Platinum Rule,
more valuable even than the Golden one, perhaps because it's something you
do <span   class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> others, rather than &ldquo;unto&rdquo; them.
</p><p>
It's around &ldquo;for&rdquo; that Linux allocation succeeds. Linux has saturated the
networked world (and our lives with it) with almost no help from marketing
of the usual sort. Our collective dependence on Linux today verges on the
absolute. Take Linux away from the world, and all but the most
electronics-free markets would cease to operate.
</p><p>
And still, because Linux is neither scarce nor sold, economics doesn't know
how to value it. Not exactly, anyway. That is, not in terms of costs or
prices.
</p><p>
Economics does have terms that cover the kind of stuff that Linux is,
however. Two are <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-rivalrous</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non-excludable</em></span>. Non-rivalrous means use
of it by one party does not prevent another party from using it;
non-excludable means it can't be made scarce. Linux is both, making it what
economists call a <span   class="emphasis"><em>public good</em></span>. Wikipedia sorts out
<span   class="emphasis"><em>rivalrous</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>excludable</em></span>
and their <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-</em></span> counterparts as shown in Table 1. 
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1c3c580.0x1d34c48"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Rivalrous, Excludable and Their Non- Counterparts (from
Wikipedia)</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Rivalrous, Excludable and Their Non- Counterparts (from&#10;Wikipedia)11223t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Excludable</th><th>Non-excludable</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rivalrous</td><td><span   class="bold"><b>Private goods:</b></span> food, clothing, cars,
personal electronics</td><td><span   class="bold"><b>Common goods (common-pool
resources):</b></span> fish stocks, timber, coal</td></tr><tr><td>Non-rivalrous</td><td><span   class="bold"><b>Club goods:</b></span> cinemas, private parks,
satellite television</td><td><span   class="bold"><b>Public goods:</b></span> free-to-air
television, air, national defense</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
This differs little from what it said when I posted the same table for
&ldquo;Greater Goods&rdquo;, an essay for the December 2006 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9344" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/9344</a>).
Back then I noted:
&ldquo;Yet it seems that the purpose of free and open-source
development is to produce a common pool resource. As Craig Burton has often
observed, the idea is to create common infrastructural building material
that supports whole industries, rather than just one player in that
industry. We do this by making goods that become abundant by being both
open and in the public domain.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And we still do, as proven by the continuing progress of useful free
and open code-making. But, as the T-shirt says, &ldquo;Yes, it works in practice,
but will it work in theory?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The best theories I've found so far are those of Yochai Benkler, Elinor
Ostrom and Lewis Hyde. (Yochai and Lewis I know well. Elinor I've never met
but would like to.) Yochai addresses the issue directly in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Coase's
Penguin, or Linux and the Nature of the Firm</em></span>. Elinor does so less directly
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective
Action</em></span>. Lewis' latest and most direct approach is in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Common as Air:
Revolution, Art, and Ownership</em></span>. My own fave, however, is Lewis' first book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern
World</em></span>, because it goes
more deeply into the matter of motivation.
</p><p>
In <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Gift</em></span>, Lewis makes a distinction between
<span   class="emphasis"><em>logos</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>eros</em></span>. The first,
he says, is &ldquo;reason and logic in general&rdquo;, and adds that &ldquo;a market economy
is an emanation of <span   class="emphasis"><em>logos</em></span>&rdquo;. The second is giving without expectation of
exchange, or even of calculation. For example, the love we give to spouses
and children, and the respect we give to friends, are gifts. To put a price
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>eros</em></span> would violate its nature, and make it something else.
</p><p>
&ldquo;People live differently who treat a portion of their wealth as a
gift&rdquo;,
Lewis writes. &ldquo;To begin with, unlike the sale of a commodity, the giving of
a gift tends to establish a relationship between the parties involved.
Furthermore, when gifts circulate within a group, their commerce leaves a
series of interconnected relationships in its wake, and a kind of
decentralized cohesiveness emerges.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Clearly we have that, at least between those who create Linux and its
conscious beneficiaries. Right now, that's a superset of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
readers. Perhaps in time it will include economists and policy-makers as
well.
