<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #215, March 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tim Bird</b></span> has started up the <span   class="bold"><b>Android Mainlining Project</b></span>, an attempt to
create an organized flow of Android features back into the main kernel
source. One of Linux's most fun qualities is that it'll compile and run
unmodified on more devices than you can count. This is rarely by
chance. In most cases, someone, or several people, are
responsible for maintaining support on that architecture. Usually, that
support is developed inside the official kernel from the start. In the
case of the Android OS, <span   class="bold"><b>Google</b></span> forked off a copy of the kernel
sources and had its teams make the extensive modifications
necessary to run on Android devices. Given the high degree of
&ldquo;drift&rdquo;
that tends to come between code bases when that happens, Tim's project
is pretty timely. Eventually, the entire Android OS may be reduced to
a simple set of configuration variables and a lot of userspace
software. Currently, it's configuration variables, userspace software
and a whole lot of kernel patches.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> once said that <span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> had the uncanny ability to
organize his kernel patches so that each one did some small thing that
was obviously good. Although the great mass of his patches, taken as a
whole, somehow also would manage to advance the kernel at large,
advancing the broader goals of developing the <span   class="bold"><b>VFS</b></span> (Virtual
Filesystem).
</p><p>
The VFS is not necessarily glamorous work, existing as it does almost
entirely beneath anything the user can actually see. But, Al's work
forms the underpinnings of every filesystem supported by Linux.
</p><p>
One little invisible thing he did lately was start cleaning up the
<span   class="bold"><b>vfsmount data structure</b></span>, so that it wouldn't export a lot of
VFS-specific data to the wider kernel world, but would take the
cleaner approach of exporting only the data that non-VFS code might
actually need. And, in keeping with Linus' comment of long ago, he was
organizing the change so as to cause the smallest possible impact on
the rest of the kernel, while paving the way for further cleanups in
the future.
</p><p>
What often happens with complex new technologies is that several
people get different ideas about how to support them, and they start
coding up those competing ideas, until one of them turns out to be the
better way. <span   class="bold"><b>Virtualization</b></span> is one of those areas. Running other OSes
under Linux used to be &ldquo;virtually&rdquo; impossible, or else there were
frustrating partial solutions that tried to emulate a particular OS
under Linux, with varying degrees of success. But, now there are things
like <span   class="bold"><b>Xen</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>KVM</b></span>, so running another OS under Linux is trivial.
As these projects continue to grow, however, their incompatibilities tend
to stand out against each other. Some kernels run better under Xen
than KVM, and vice versa. So, when <span   class="bold"><b>Stefano
Stabellini</b></span> recently
announced a port of Xen to the <span   class="bold"><b>Cortez-A15 ARM
processor</b></span>, the resulting
technical discussion on the mailing list tended to focus a bit on
getting Xen and KVM to play nicely together.
</p><p>
Another area where multiple visions have been realized in the official
kernel tree is with display drivers. Between <span   class="bold"><b>OMAP</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>DRM</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>framebuffer projects</b></span>, no one can agree on which code base should be
used to provide a more general display infrastructure that the others
could be built on top of. Apparently, there's plenty of bad blood to go
around, and all the projects think that they are the most natural
choice for the job.
</p><p>
Recently, the topic came up again when <span   class="bold"><b>Tomi
Valkeinen</b></span>, author of the
OMAP display driver, suggested using OMAP as the framework for all
display drivers. Of course, the DRM and framebuffer folks thought that
would be a bad idea, and a full-throated debate ensued.
</p><p>
Ultimately, through some mediation by <span   class="bold"><b>Alan
Cox</b></span>, the decision seems to
have been made just to focus on making all three of those systems more
and more compatible with each other. This is a clever idea, because
it's hard to argue <span   class="emphasis"><em>against</em></span> greater compatibility. While at the same
time, as the different implementations become more similar, it should
become clearer and clearer which one truly would be the better choice
to provide an underlying infrastructure for the others.

<h2 class="title">Calibre in the Cloud</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #215, March 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've mentioned before that I keep my entire e-book collection in my
Dropbox folder, and I can access it anywhere I have a Web connection. I
didn't come up with the idea myself; instead, I shamelessly stole
the idea from Bill Childers. I suspect he stole it from someone else,
so feel free to steal the idea from me.
</p><p>
Basically, it involves two programs, both free (well, three, if you count
Dropbox). First, create a folder inside your Public folder that
resides in your Dropbox folder. You can name this folder anything you
like, but because it will be hosting all your e-books, it's wise to name
it something no one would guess.
</p><p>
Then, in Calibre, click on the bookshelf icon (upper left), and click
&ldquo;switch library&rdquo;. Then, select that new secret folder you made inside
your Public Dropbox folder. Calibre will move your entire library to
that folder, so make sure you have enough free space in your Dropbox
to handle your entire e-book collection. If you have too many e-books,
you could create a separate library inside Calibre and just keep a
select few books in that Public folder.
</p><p>
Now you should have a working install of Calibre that stores your e-books
and database inside your Dropbox. You simply can open this library file
with Calibre on other computers that sync with Dropbox, or you can go
one step further and create a cloud-based repository that you can browse
from any computer. And, that's where calibre2opds comes into play.
</p><p>
calibre2opds is a Java application that creates a Web site from your
Calibre library. Download the Java application from <a href="http://www.calibre2opds.com" target="_self">www.calibre2opds.com</a>,
and launch it with your favorite Java runtime environment. Once it's
launched, you'll see <span   class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> options for tweaking how your library will
look. The first thing you need to do is make sure the Database
Folder is pointed to the secret folder to which you moved your Calibre
library. Then, you'll want to set the Catalog Folder to
something. It's okay to leave it set to _catalog, which is the default.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11226calibref1.large.jpg"><img src="11226calibref1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. calibre2opds is a GUI Java application.
</p></div></div><p>
Next, you need to decide what sort of Web site you want to create. If
you want to be able to browse it with any Web browser, leave the
&ldquo;Compatibility Level&rdquo; at &ldquo;OPDS&rdquo;. If you want to browse directly
with your Android device, you can choose either TROOK or ALDIKO, and
calibre2opds will generate a catalog that those readers can access directly.
Once you tweak any other settings to your liking, click the Generate
Catalogs button on the bottom, and it will create all the files you
need right inside your Calibre database folder.
</p><p>
Because you did all this inside your Public Dropbox folder, you can look
for that _catalog folder and find the index.html file inside it. Right-click on index.html, get the Dropbox public link for it, and see
the result. (Note: you may need to find the index.xml file if you're
trying to browse with Aldiko or Trook.)

<h2 class="title">Cryptocurrency: Your Total Cost Is 01001010010</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #215, March 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Most people have heard of gold. Most people are familiar with dollars. For
a handful of geeky folks, however, the currency they hope will become a
global standard is digital. Whether it's a problem or not, the currency
you use on a day-to-day basis is tied to the government. The global
value of the money in your pocket can vary widely, and if you're a
conspiracy theorist, your concern might be that it could be worth
nothing in the blink of an eye.
</p><p>
Surely gold and silver are wise investments if you're concerned your
paper dollars will drop in value, but using gold as a means to buy
a gallon of milk is a bit difficult. Perhaps cryptocurrencies are the
solution. The most popular form of cryptocurrency is the Bitcoin. A very
simple explanation of how it works is as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Users download the bitcoin client and use their computer to solve
complex math problems, which create a cryptographic record of any
transactions on the Bitcoin P2P network.
</p></li><li><p>
Users are rewarded Bitcoins for successfully &ldquo;hashing&rdquo; the
cryptographic record of transactions, and that reward system is how
Bitcoins are created.
</p></li><li><p>
Users then securely transfer Bitcoins back and forth to purchase items,
and those transactions are recorded in the cryptographic history for
the entire P2P network to see.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The process is, of course, a little more complicated than that, but that's
basically how it works. The computers creating the cryptographic history
of transactions are called miners, and &ldquo;Bitcoin Mining&rdquo; is simply the
act of solving complex math problems in order to make a cryptographic
record of transactions. Because mining Bitcoins is how the currency
is created, lots of people are connected to the network, racing each
other to get a solution that will generate a reward. In fact, it's so
competitive, that unless you have a high-end GPU that can process the
equations extremely fast, there is no point in trying for the rewards.
</p><p>
Are Bitcoins the future of global currencies? Will one of the alternative
cryptocurrencies like Litecoin or Solidcoin become commonplace? The number
of places that accept cryptocurrencies are extremely limited, so it's
not any easier to buy a gallon of milk with a Bitcoin than it is with a
lump of gold, but many think that day is coming. What about you? Do you
think cryptocurrency has a future, or do you think it's a geeky fad
that will fade away? Send an e-mail with &ldquo;CRYPTOCURRENCY&rdquo; in the
subject line to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, and I'll follow up with a Web article
based on your feedback. For more information on cryptocurrencies, check

If you want to record your Windows screen, but don't want to fork out
the money for a commercial application like Camtasia, you might want to
give CamStudio a try. CamStudio is an open-source program that captures
your Windows desktop and encodes the video using an open-source video
codec.
</p><p>
CamStudio has many features, including picture-in-picture support for
folks with Webcams. If you're using Windows on one of your computers
and want to try out some open-source screen capturing, give CamStudio
a try. Download it at <a href="http://www.camstudio.org" target="_self">www.camstudio.org</a> or from SourceForge at

<h2 class="title">GSL, Part II: Getting Work Done</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #215, March 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My last article introduced the GNU Scientific Library and how
to include it in your code, but I didn't really cover what you actually can
do with this library. Here, I describe some of
the available functionality, which hopefully will spark
your interest in taking a deeper look.
</p><p>
A series of functions exist for handling polynomials. A polynomial
is a function of different powers of a variable, with each element
multiplied by a constant&mdash;for example:
</p><p>
P(x) = c[0] + c[1]*x + c[2]*x<sup  >2</sup> + ...
</p><p>
In the GSL, a polynomial is represented by an array containing all of
the constants, with zeros for all of the missing powers. So, if your
polynomial is P(x) = 5 + x<tt  >3</tt>, your polynomial would
be represented by <tt  >c =
[5,0,0,1]</tt>. Several functions are available for evaluating your
polynomial at some particular value of x. And, there are separate functions
for evaluating your function for real values of x
(<tt  >gsl_poly_eval</tt>),
complex values of x (<tt  >gsl_poly_complex_eval</tt>) and complex values
of x with complex coefficients
(<tt  >gsl_complex_poly_complex_eval</tt>). This
is because complex numbers are separate data types
(<tt  >gsl_complex</tt>)
and need to be handled differently from simple doubles. 
</p><p>
Aside from
evaluating polynomials, you may want to solve the polynomial and
get the roots of your equation. The most basic example is finding the roots of a
quadratic equation. These roots may be real or complex, which means
there are two different functions:
<tt  >gsl_poly_solve_quadratic</tt> and
<tt  >gsl_poly_complex_solve_quadratic</tt>. You hand in the values for the three
coefficients and pointers to two variables to hold the two possible
roots:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gsl_poly_solve_quadratic(double a, double b, 
 &#8618;double c, double *x0, double *x1)
</pre>
</p><p>
If there are no real roots, x0 and x1 are unchanged. Otherwise,
the roots are placed successively into x0, and then x1. There are
equivalent functions to find the roots of a quadratic equation
called <tt  >gsl_poly_solve_cubic</tt> and
<tt  >gsl_poly_solve_complex_cubic</tt>. 
</p><p>
Once
you get beyond a quadratic equation, there is no analytical way to find
the roots of a polynomial equation. The GSL provides an iterative method
to find the approximate locations of the roots of a higher order
polynomial. But, you need to set up some scratch memory that can be used
for this purpose. For a polynomial with n coefficients, you would use
<tt  >gsl_poly_complex_workspace_alloc(n)</tt> to create this
scratch space. Then,
you can call <tt  >gsl_poly_complex_solve</tt> to run this process. After you are
done, you would need to call
<tt  >gsl_poly_complex_workspace_free</tt> to free up
this scratch space.
</p><p>
In science, lots of special functions are used in solving
problems, and the GSL has support for dozens of functions. To use them,
start by including <tt  >gsl_sf.h</tt> in your source code. These functions can
be called in two different ways. You can call them directly and simply
get the computed value as a result. So, if you wanted to calculate the
value of a Bessel function, you could use this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
double ans = gsl_sf_bessel_J0(x);
</pre>
</p><p>
But, you will have no idea if there were any problems during this computation.
To get that information, you would call a variant of this function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gsl_sf_result result;
int status = gsl_sf_bessel_J0_e(x, &amp;result);

</pre>
</p><p>
The value of <tt  >status</tt> lets you know if there were any error conditions, like
overflow, underflow or loss of precision. If there were no errors, 
the function call returns <tt  >GSL_SUCCESS</tt>. The result variable is actually
a struct, with members <tt  >val</tt> (the computed value of
the function) and <tt  >err</tt>
(an estimate of the absolute error in <tt  >val</tt>). All of the special functions
default to evaluating with double precision, but in some cases, this is
simply too costly time-wise. In order to save time in cases where a lower
level of accuracy is acceptable, the GSL special functions can accept
a mode argument:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_PREC_DOUBLE</tt> &mdash; double precision, accuracy of 
2*10<sup  >-16</sup>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_PREC_SINGLE</tt> &mdash; single precision, accuracy of 
10<sup  >-7</sup>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_PREC_APPROX</tt> &mdash; approximate values, accuracy of 
5*10<sup  >-4</sup>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Some of the special functions supported by the GSL include Airy functions,
Bessel functions, Debye functions, elliptic integrals, exponential
functions, Fermi-Dirac functions, Legendre functions, spherical harmonics
and many more. It's definitely worth taking a look at the manual before
you even think about writing your own version of some function, because
it's
very likely already been done for you.
</p><p>
Vectors and matrices are used as data types in several scientific
problems. The GSL has support for doing calculations with both vectors and
matrices, treating them as new data types. They are both based on a data
type called a block. A GSL block is a struct containing the size of the
block, along with a pointer to the memory location where the block is
actually stored. A vector is a struct defined as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
   size_t size;   /* number of elements in the vector */
   size_t stride; /* step size from one element to the next */
   double *data; /* location of the first element */
   gsl_block *block; /* location of block if data 
                        is stored in a block */
   int owner; /* do I own this block */
} gsl_vector;
</pre>
</p><p>
If <tt  >owner</tt> equals 1, the associated block is freed when the vector
is freed. Otherwise, the associated block is left alone when the vector
is freed. Because of the complexity of the structure, there are special
functions to handle vectors. The function
<tt  >gsl_vector_alloc(n)</tt> creates a
vector of size n, with the data stored in the block member and the owner
flag set to 1. The function <tt  >gsl_vector_free()</tt> frees the previously created
vector structure. To manipulate individual elements of your new vector,
you need to use the functions <tt  >gsl_vector_get(const gsl_vector *v, size_t
i</tt>) and <tt  >gsl_vector_set(gsl_vector *v, size_t i,
double x</tt>). If you instead
want a pointer to an element, you can use <tt  >gsl_vector_ptr(gsl_vector *v,
size_t i</tt>). Matrices are very similar, being defined as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
   size_t size1; /* number of rows */
   size_t size2; /* number of columns */
   size_t tda; /* number of bytes for one row */
   double *data; /* location of matrix data */
   gsl_block *block; /* underlying storage block */
   int owner; /* do I own this block */
} gsl_matrix;
</pre>
</p><p>
Matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the way it is
done in C. Allocation and deallocation are handled by the functions
<tt  >gsl_matrix_alloc()</tt> and
<tt  >gsl_matrix_free()</tt>. Accessing elements are handled
through the functions <tt  >gsl_matrix_get()</tt> and
<tt  >gsl_matrix_set()</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that you have vectors and matrices, what can you do with
them? The GSL has support for the BLAS library (Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms). There is a wrapped version, accessible through
gsl_blas.h,
where you can use GSL vectors and matrices in the functions. You
also have access to the raw BLAS functions through the include file
gsl_cblas.h. The GSL version treats all matrices as dense matrices,
so if you want to use band-format or packed-format matrices, you 
need to use the raw functions. There are three levels of BLAS operations:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Level 1: vector operations.
</p></li><li><p>
Level 2: matrix-vector operations.
</p></li><li><p>
Level 3: matrix-matrix operations.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
BLAS has functions for things like dot products, vector sums and cross
products. This provides the base for the linear algebra functions in
the GSL. They are declared in the header gsl_linalg.h and are handled
through level-1 and level-2 BLAS calls. There are functions for
decomposition (LU, QR, singular value, Cholesky, tridiagonal and
Hessenberg), Householder transformations and balancing. The header
file gsl_eigen.h provides functions for calculating eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of matrices. There are versions for real symmetric,
real nonsymmetric, complex hermitian and real generalized nonsymmetric
eigensystems, among others.
</p><p>
The last thing to look at is the functionality supporting calculus
calculations. A whole group of functions handles numerical
integration, and there are routines for both adaptive and non-adaptive
integration for general functions. There also are specialized versions for
special cases like infinite ranges, singular integrals and oscillatory
integrals. The types of errors that may happen when you are trying to
do a numerical integration are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_EMAXITER</tt> &mdash; the maximum number of
subdivisions was exceeded.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_EROUND</tt> &mdash; cannot reach tolerance because of
round-off error.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_ESING</tt> &mdash; a non-integrable singularity or
bad integrand behavior.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >GSL_EDIVERGE</tt> &mdash; integral is divergent or
doesn't converge quickly enough. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Numerical differentiation also can be done, using finite
differencing. These functions are adaptive, trying to find the most
accurate result. The three versions are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_deriv_central()</tt> &mdash; central difference
algorithm.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_deriv_forward()</tt> &mdash; adaptive forward
difference algorithm.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >gsl_deriv_backward()</tt> &mdash; adaptive backward
difference algorithm. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In all of these, you hand in a pointer to a function, the value of x
where you want to calculate the derivative and a step-size, h, for the
algorithm. You also hand in pointers to variables to store the values
of the result and the absolute error.
</p><p>
I have barely scratched the surface of what is available in the
GSL. Hopefully, you now have a better idea of some of the functions
available. Although lots of scientific packages are available,
sometimes there really is no option except writing your own. With the
GSL, you should be able to do this with a bit less work and get to the
actual computational science more quickly.

<h2 class="title">Tikl Me, Elmo</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #215, March 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Somewhere between the world of SMS messages and voice calling is the
land of two-way push-to-talk technology. Some cell-phone providers have
this feature as an option for select phones, which makes your 2012-era
cell phone act like a CB radio from the 1970s. Don't get me wrong, I
understand there are situations when this is beneficial, but it still
makes me laugh to see people using smartphones like walkie-talkies.
</p><p>
If you don't have the push-to-talk (PTT) feature from your cell-phone
provider, you can download the free Tikl app from the Android Marketplace.
Tikl allows you to use PTT technology with any other users that have Tikl
installed on their phones. Because Tikl is available for both Android and
iOS, it covers a wide variety of smartphones.
</p><p>
I don't use Tikl very often, but in my limited testing at a softball
game, it worked as advertised. My daughter was able to give me her
10&ndash;20,
and I was able to give her a big 10&ndash;4 on her request to play on the
swings. Although using Tikl while driving probably is safer than texting,
we still don't recommend it. It'd be tough to convince the Smokey
that your Android smartphone is really a CB radio.

<h2 class="title">New <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Annual Archives for E-Readers</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Katherine Druckman</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #215, March 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As this issue suggests, mobile technology is more a part of our lives
than ever, and we are becoming accustomed to having a tremendous
amount of information available to us at all times, frequently on
gadgets we keep in our pockets and bags. I am also a person who likes
to keep a lot of documents, books and other reference materials on my
phone, NOOK or tablet. You never know when you might need
to look something up, right?
</p><p>
In order to make our articles even more available to you, we are
introducing an annual eBook of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> content in epub and mobi
formats. I am a huge fan of these formats. In addition to the many
benefits of reflowing text, I also enjoy the ability to search, highlight
and take notes using my e-reader software. This new compilation of all
12 issues from 2011, is organized much like our popular Archive DVD
and contains all of the articles from 2011 in one easily navigable file.
This should be exciting to our readers who are fans of these e-reader
formats, as it includes earlier issues that previously were not
available for e-readers.
