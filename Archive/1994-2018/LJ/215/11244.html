Technology is funny. Not too many years ago, the goal was to make a
cell phone as tiny as technologically possible. Now, phones like the Galaxy
Note are striving for aircraft-carrier size. This month, whether you want
to embed a phone into your sneaker or play hopscotch in order
to dial your buddy, we've got you covered. Mobile devices can do almost
anything traditional computer systems can do, and oftentimes, they can do it
better.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts the issue off with logging. No, he doesn't show how to
cut down trees with your Razr, but rather he talks about the importance of
making applications that keep a log. Logs are really pointless, until you
need them. Then, they're invaluable. If you need more convincing, listen to
Reuven; you can trust him to lead you in the right direction. Dave Taylor,
on the other hand, I don't recommend trusting&mdash;at least not in a game of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>. Dave continues his series on how to be a lying, cheating, filthy,
jerk&mdash;for educational purposes only, of course! In all seriousness, Dave
explores some really cool scripting using a very practical, if nefarious,
object lesson.
</p><p>
Our king of nefarious, Kyle Rankin, finishes his series on password
cracking in this issue. By this time, you've all learned how to do brute-force
attacks with a GPU, so Kyle spends this month explaining how to tweak
things so you can get the most
hack for your buck. I follow Kyle's &ldquo;educational&rdquo; article with the second
installment of my new column, The Open-Source Classroom. This month, I
start a series on LTSP. Thin clients have evolved a lot since I started
using them back in 2001 or so. I'll walk you through setting up a lab, and
in the next few issues, I'll teach you how to tweak the system. Kyle probably
will follow up with a tutorial on using the distributed CPU power of thin clients
to break in to the local 7-11, but you'll have to wait and see.
</p><p>
Mark O'Connor shows how to use Linux on an iPad. No, probably not how
you think, but rather, he explains how to use Linode on an iPad in order to
do your work in the cloud. If you want the convenience of an iPad with the
power and flexibility of Linux, Mark's solution is worth a look. Bill
Childers does a similar feat with his article on IRC proxying to mobile
devices. I've been using Irssi in a Screen session for all my instant
messaging for a few months now, but I'll admit it's rough when I'm out and
about. Logging in to Irssi on a software-keyboard over SSH isn't terribly
fun on a phone. Bill describes how to get the best of both worlds, and at
the same time!
</p><p>
Rebecca &ldquo;Ruji&rdquo; Chapnik also delves into the command line, but instead of
bridging IRC to a mobile device, she shows how to play music from the
console. Many Linux users think Ncurses is as GUI as an application ever
needs to get (ahem, Kyle Rankin), and Rebecca shows how to use the
command line to its fullest extent. Stuart Jarvis heads in the opposite
direction and talks about Plasma Active. Tablet computing is still quite
young, and the interfaces we use on touchscreen devices are far from
perfect. Stuart describes what KDE is doing to address tablets and
touchscreen devices. As someone who constantly thinks tablet computers
would be great if they had hinges and keyboards, I'm interested in
alternative interfaces!
</p><p>
Don't worry if you prefer your Linux more &ldquo;desktoppy&rdquo; than mobile. This is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and we always have a variety of articles that will tickle
every geek's interest. Whether you want to continue the series on EFI with
Roderick W. Smith, or explore the world of cryptocurrency with me, this
issue has lots to offer. As always, we hope you enjoy this issue, we sure did.
