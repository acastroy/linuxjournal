If you have a few older computers and a second
Ethernet card, give the Linux Terminal Server Project a try.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x232a358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of my very first articles for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was in August 2007
about the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP). The other article I
wrote in that issue was about my MAME arcade system. Oddly enough,
five years later, the most common questions I get from readers are about
LTSP. And, the most common questions from my students are still about the
arcade system! A lot has changed in the past half-decade, so in my next few
articles, I explore the new face of thin clients.

MueKow, Because Geeks Have the Best Code Names</h2></div></div><p>
The term &ldquo;thin client&rdquo; often refers to a specific type of computer,
but when it comes to LTSP, &ldquo;thin client&rdquo; means any computer that
boots via the network and runs its operating system from a remotely
mounted image. The &ldquo;thin&rdquo; moniker is used because there is no need
for the workstation to have a hard drive. This type of system offers
several advantages over traditional workstations:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
All workstations boot from a single image, meaning updates and changes
need to be done only once.
</p></li><li><p>
The network &ldquo;hard drive&rdquo; is mounted in read-only mode, so
it's impossible to corrupt an individual computer.
</p></li><li><p>
Hard drive failures are no longer an issue.
</p></li><li><p>
Stolen workstations contain no data, because everything is stored on
the server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The LTSP process works like this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Workstation boots via PXE.
</p></li><li><p>
DHCP server tells workstation where to get its kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
Workstation downloads kernel via TFTP.
</p></li><li><p>
Workstation mounts root directory in read-only mode over the network.
</p></li><li><p>
Workstation loads X11 locally and connects to the server.
</p></li><li><p>
All programs, except for X11 itself, run on the server, requiring minimal
resources on the thin client.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In versions of LTSP before 5.0, the root directory was a specialized
system mounted over NFS. It was stripped down to contain only the bits
required to get X11 running, and then it pointed clients to the server
via XDMCP. This had the advantage of requiring very minimal resources
on the workstation (I'm talking requirements as low as Pentium I
CPUs and 32MB of RAM or less). This also meant it was very difficult,
or even impossible, to customize the workstation's operating system.
</p><p>
Version 5 of LTSP, code-named MueKow, changed the way the
network-mounted system was created and maintained. Instead of a
specialized Linux system, it used a chroot environment containing a
minimal install of the same operating system running on the server.
Workstations still booted the same way, but now the chroot environment
could be updated and customized. There also were other changes under
the hood, like using SSH instead of XDMCP and creating a custom display
manager (LDM). An NBD (network block device) server was used instead of
NFS, increasing network efficiency as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x232b0c0"></a>
If It Ain't Broke, Why Fix It?</h2></div></div><p>
A big motivation for changing the way LTSP managed its underlying
operating system was that workstations, even outdated ones, were far
too powerful to waste. Because traditionally, all applications ran on
the powerful LTSP server, it would become overloaded quickly when users
tried to run Adobe Flash or Java apps. With the new chroot environment,
it became possible to run some apps locally and some apps on the
server. This meant servers could handle more thin clients connected to
them, and that workstations shared the load. It also meant a runaway
by an application like Firefox would use 100% of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>workstation</em></span> CPU,
and not the server. I'll dive into local apps in Part II of this series, but I wanted
to mention it now as it was a prime motivation for MueKow.
</p><p>
LTSP 5's new methodology does increase the system requirements for
the thin clients themselves. Basically, whatever server system you're
running (Ubuntu 11.10, for example) must be supported for the thin-client
hardware. Because Ubuntu 11.10 requires at least a Pentium 4, so does LTSP
5 running on Ubuntu 11.10. (The Ubuntu kernel might actually boot on a
Pentium 3, but if you're sticking with recommended CPUs, P4 is where
it's at.) Because very little actually is running on the thin client
itself, it's possible to skimp on RAM. Although a minimum of 256MB is
recommended, I've used 128MB systems successfully.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11225f1.large.jpg"><img src="11225f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Old workstations make perfect LTSP thin clients. These machines
were donated as junk, but they'll make excellent student workstations.
</p></div></div><p>
So what this all means is that LTSP has shifted the responsibility
of defining &ldquo;minimal configuration&rdquo; to the server's operating
system. In general though, it's good to have thin-client machines with
the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Pentium 4 or greater CPU.
</p></li><li><p>
256MB of RAM.
</p></li><li><p>
PXE-bootable network card.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If the computer doesn't support PXE booting, it's possible to use gPXE
to boot the computer from the network. Although not terribly difficult to
configure, gPXE is beyond the scope of this article. For more information,
check out <a href="http://www.etherboot.org" target="_self">www.etherboot.org</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x232b7f8"></a>
We've Secretly Replaced Your Hard Drive with an Ethernet Port</h2></div></div><p>
LTSP requires a good network infrastructure. There's really no way
to sugarcoat it; it just does. Because the operating system is mounted
over the network, any time the thin client needs to access its &ldquo;hard
drive&rdquo;, it has to communicate over the network. Thankfully, LTSP 5 is
more efficient at this than previous versions, because instead of the
traditional NFS-mounted filesystem, LTSP 5 uses NBD. The Network Block
Device serves a single file, which is an image of the underlying file
structure. This distinction means NBD is significantly faster and strains
the network less than NFS. Even with that, however, LTSP requires a
good network infrastructure. A gigabit-switched backbone with at least
100Mbit switched connections for each thin client is recommended. Anything
less will really affect performance.
</p><p>
Thankfully, by default, LTSP runs in a split network environment. That
means the server has two Ethernet cards. One card connects to the main
network, and the other creates a NAT to which the thin clients can connect.
This is a great way to isolate a thin-client lab, especially when a
beefy network infrastructure isn't available. This method means the
thin clients must be connected physically to the same switch as the
NAT side of the server, but for smaller installations, that's usually
not a problem. (I'll talk about larger thin-client installs in later
articles.) When failover and high availability come into play, a good
site-wide network infrastructure is really required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x232ba08"></a>
It's Not the Size of Your Server, It's How You Use It</h2></div></div><p>
Part of the confusion behind LTSP is that it's very flexible, so a
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; install is a misnomer from the beginning. Like I just
mentioned, the default installation method is to use a server with two
Ethernet cards and create a private NAT'd network for the thin clients
to live on. One huge advantage to this sort of install is that a modern
workstation-class computer can act as a server for a small handful of
thin clients. A dual-core workstation with 4GB of RAM easily could host
4&ndash;5 thin clients and still work as a desktop workstation itself. This
setup is very attractive for teachers who want to provide terminals
for their classrooms.
</p><p>
Every LTSP install is slightly different, so it's also difficult
to judge how big a &ldquo;server&rdquo; needs to be to support X number of
thin clients. You can make some educated guesses, but honestly, the
best way is to test and see. If Ubuntu recommends 512MB of RAM, you
can see the aforementioned workstation/server has eight times as much RAM
as is required. Based on that rough figure, 4&ndash;5 thin clients should
be able to share the resources of the server computer and still run
efficiently. That's obviously a very rough figure, but you need to
start the trial and error somewhere!
</p><p>
Because LTSP depends so much on the network in order to function, your
server, whatever size, really should have gigabit Ethernet. Thin clients
can run just fine with 100Mbit connections, but the server should have
gigabit. Once you have your server ready to install, and your thin clients
(whether they are old workstations or fancy new thin-client devices)
ready to boot from the network, it's time to install LTSP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x232bc70"></a>
Ubuntu Makes Questions Easier to Ask</h2></div></div><p>
I recommend Ubuntu for your first LTSP experience. The simple reason is
that most LTSP folks use Ubuntu, so it's easier to find support. Before
version 5, LTSP was pretty closely tied to Red Hat-based operating
systems. Now, with the MueKow concept, LTSP no longer is tied to a
specific distribution. For the purpose of this article, however, I'm
assuming Ubuntu
is the distribution used. (It should be fairly easy to adapt to other
distributions.)
</p><p>
If you have a server with two Ethernet cards, Ubuntu's Alternate CD can
set up everything you need automatically. Boot up your server computer
from the Alternate CD, and press F4. You'll see &ldquo;Install an
LTSP server&rdquo; as one of the options (Figure 2). If you select that
option, Ubuntu installs like normal, and at the end of the install,
you'll see it build the chroot environment for LTSP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11225f2.large.jpg"><img src="11225f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Ubuntu's Alternate CD makes installing an LTSP server simple.
</p></div></div><p>
Once the installation is complete, any thin clients connected to your
second Ethernet card should be able to boot via PXE directly into an
Ubuntu session. While I'm a big fan of magic, I also like to know how
it works. So in a nutshell, here's what's going on behind the scenes
during the install:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A TFTP server is installed and activated on the second Ethernet port.
</p></li><li><p>
A DHCP server is installed and activated on the second Ethernet port.
(Note: it's important to keep the second Ethernet port off your main
network, because your DHCP server could mess up the rest of your
network&mdash;keep the second Ethernet port separate!)
</p></li><li><p>
The LTSP-specific software is installed on the server. This includes
things like LDM, which is the login screen thin clients display when
they boot up.
</p></li><li><p>
A minimal Ubuntu install is put into a chroot in your /opt/ltsp
directory. This is a complete Ubuntu system with X11 support, but it has
minimal applications installed, because by default, it launches only X11
then connects to the server.
</p></li><li><p>
The chroot folder is compressed into an NBD (Network Block Device)
image.
</p></li><li><p>
An NBD server is installed and activated on the second Ethernet port,
which serves the NBD image just created.
</p></li><li><p>
The kernel is copied from the chroot environment to the TFTP server.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x2724808"></a>
You're Done&mdash;Now Get Started</h2></div></div><p>
I mentioned the abstract process thin clients use when booting from
the server. Now that you know how LTSP 5 is set up, let me elaborate a
bit. When you power up your thin clients, this is what happens:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The thin client, connected to the same network switch as the server's
second Ethernet port sends out a PXE request.
</p></li><li><p>
The DHCP server responds, telling the thin client the address of
the server (192.168.1.254 by default) and the name of the kernel image
to download.
</p></li><li><p>
The thin client downloads the kernel via TFTP from the server's
TFTP server.
</p></li><li><p>
Once the thin client loads the kernel, it mounts the NBD image of
the root filesystem via NBD.
</p></li><li><p>
The thin client starts X11 and connects to LDM on the server.
</p></li><li><p>
The thin client is ready to log in!
</p></li></ol></div><p>
With this basic install of LTSP, all applications are executed on the
server. This is a confusing concept for many folks, but I explain to my
users that a thin client is basically a remote keyboard/mouse/monitor
for the server. When a user starts Firefox, for example, the application
starts on the server&mdash;you just control it remotely. If you're
familiar with X11 forwarding over SSH, the concept should be easier to
wrap your brain around.
</p><p>
Because everything is done on the server machine, any users or applications
added to the server computer are available on the thin clients. This
means LTSP users are simply users on the Ubuntu box, and they can be added
or deleted using the standard Ubuntu tools.
</p><p>
Even with my explanation of how thin clients boot and what the server
does in the background, you'll notice there are still some mysterious
things going on. Sound probably &ldquo;just works&rdquo; on the thin client,
although that's usually not the case with remote X11 apps.
A few other hurdles have been conquered with LTSP 5 that
historically were a problem. Things get much more complex when you start
running some applications locally on the thin client and some applications
remotely&mdash;but that's for next month's article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2232580.0x2724ee8"></a>
This Month, Try to Break Things!</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a fully running Ubuntu system on all your thin clients,
see if you can find some of the limitations of such a system. If you have
a classroom of kids to use as guinea pigs, have them use Adobe Flash-based
Web sites, and see if you can notice your server slowing down. Install a
printer on your server, and notice how all the thin clients automatically
have access to it. Notice how LibreOffice loads lightning fast after
it's been opened on one machine (it gets loaded into memory).
</p><p>
LTSP is a powerful way to utilize older hardware. It also can make system
maintenance minimal, because there is only a single install of Ubuntu
to keep updated. To be honest, I've barely scratched the surface in this
article&mdash;you can tweak LTSP to do some amazing things. In my next few
articles, I'll cover local apps, print servers, network tweaks,
load balancing and more. If you have a few older computers and a second
Ethernet card, I urge you to give LTSP a try. By the time you're done,
you'll be able to make your thin clients dance an Irish jig. (Or
whatever the geeky network equivalent of Irish jigs might be!)
