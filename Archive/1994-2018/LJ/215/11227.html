Dave continues to explore how to create a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> suggestion engine and learns
that regular expressions sometimes aren't the best path to a solution.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b2408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I looked at a simple crossword-puzzle word finder, something that
requires a word list and a basic understanding of grep. Then, I switched
to looking at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and the popular on-line
equivalent <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span>.
</p><p>
In this latter case, the problem turns out to be quite a bit more
difficult. Say you have seven tiles (one or more of which could be a blank or
wild-card tile, but I'll address that later) that are a random set of
letters, and from that, you want to combine them to create dictionary words.
For example, I'm playing a game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With Friends</em></span> with my sister, and the
tiles I have to work with are T E C Y Z S X. But, of course, any good
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> player knows that you also need to work with the letters already on the
board, so although I can make a word like &ldquo;YET&rdquo; or
&ldquo;SEX&rdquo; from these
letters, I still have to interlock the word onto the board somehow. It's harder, but
that's where big-point word play comes from.
</p><p>
Still, let's stick with the basics: enter a set of letters, and the
script will offer a set of possible words using those letters. What about
all these nuances?
Yeah, they're going to make this <span   class="emphasis"><em>way</em></span> more complicated!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b28d8"></a>
Words from Your Letters</h2></div></div><p>
Tapping the word list we downloaded in the last column, the most obvious
search is for the letters as a regular expression:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep '^t*e*c*y*z*s*x$' words.txt
ex
</pre>
</p><p>
Ah, that doesn't work well because the order of the letters is
important to grep although it's not important to us. Instead, a complicated
pipe offers an interesting alternative:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep t words.txt | grep e | grep c | grep y 
 &#8618;| grep z | grep s | grep x
</pre>
</p><p>
But, that doesn't produce any results because it's looking for
words that have all the letters in our hand, and that's basically
impossible.
</p><p>
So, what about this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep 't*' words.txt | grep 'e*' | grep 'c*' | grep 'y*' 
 &#8618;| grep 'z*' | grep 's*' | grep 'x*'
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >x*</tt> notation is &ldquo;zero or more occurrences
of letter x&rdquo;, and that is clearly not going to work because every
word matches this complex search pattern if you think about it.
</p><p>
Let's flip this around and screen out all words that contain letters
not in our set of letters instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -vE '[^tecyzsx]' words.txt
cee
cees
cess
</pre>
</p><p>
There's another problem. The words match, except we're not taking
into account the frequency of each letter. That is, although
&ldquo;cess&rdquo;
indeed comprises only letters in our set, we have one
&ldquo;s&rdquo;,
not two, so it's not actually a valid match.
</p><p>
Then again, at least it's a step in the right direction, which is more
than the previous examples have demonstrated, so let's run with it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b2f08"></a>
Analyzing Length and Filtering Results</h2></div></div><p>
With seven letters, the first simple secondary filter is that any words
longer than seven letters can be axed. How to test? The wc command
works, but awkwardly. Still, I have a sense we're going to end up with
each possible match going into a more complex test, so let's start
building it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# Findword -- find matching dictionary words for 
 &#8618;Scrabble given a set of letters
datafile="words.txt"
maxlength=7
minlength=4 
if [ -z "$1" ] ; then
  echo "Usage: $(basename $0) letters"; exit 1
fi 
for possibility in $(grep -vE "[^$1]" words.txt)
do
  length=$(echo $possibility | wc -c)
  if [ $length -gt $maxlength ] ; then
    echo "$possibility is too long"
  elif [ $length -lt $minlength ] ; then
    echo "$possibility is too short"
  else
    echo $possibility is a possibility -- length = $length
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a built-in problem with this script that you'll realize if
you're familiar with how wc counts letters. To demonstrate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo linux | wc -c
       6
</pre>
</p><p>
Six? Shouldn't that be five?
</p><p>
The fix is to add the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# adjust lengths because our fast wc-c adds 1 char
maxlength=$(( $maxlength + 1 ))
minlength=$(( $minlength + 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
You might find it faster simply to add one to each of the default
settings, but because down the road, I am anticipating letting the user
specify min/max length words, the compensatory code seems a better
solution.
</p><p>
With that added code, we can find five-, six- or seven-letter words that
are made up of only the letters in our hand by simply commenting out
the &ldquo;too long/too short&rdquo; message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ findword.sh tecyzsx
cees is a possibility -- length = 5
cess is a possibility -- length = 5
cesse is a possibility -- length = 6
cesses is a possibility -- length = 7
cete is a possibility -- length = 5
cetes is a possibility -- length = 6
cyeses is a possibility -- length = 7
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we can't sidestep any longer; it's time to figure out how to test
for the frequency of each letter to ensure that the words actually
can be formed by the tiles we hold. Note that in the above example, none
of the above words are actually a match when letter frequency is taken
into account.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b34e0"></a>
Counting Letter Occurrences</h2></div></div><p>
The first piece of this puzzle is to figure out how many times a letter
occurs in a given word or sequence. Although there probably is a regular
expression to do just that, I settled on the <tt  >-o</tt> flag to grep,
as demonstrated:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo test | grep -o t
t
t
</pre>
</p><p>
Append a <tt  >wc -l</tt>, and you can write a simple function that returns
the number of times a specified letter occurs in a given word or sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
occurrences()
{
  # how many times does 'letter' occur in 'word'? 
  local count=$( echo $2 | grep -o $1 | wc -l )
  echo $count
}
echo occurrences "t" "test"
occurrences "t" "test"
</pre>
</p><p>
Testing will demonstrate that the result is &ldquo;2&rdquo;, as hoped
for. This'll be the starting point for us in my next article when we continue
this epic scripting journey into the world of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words With
Friends</em></span> and other word games.
