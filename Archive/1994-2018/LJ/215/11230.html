Knowing how to read logs and write to them are important skills for all
Web developers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x130d300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When you're writing programs that operate on the command line, the
error messages either appear in the same place as you're typing (that is, in
the same terminal window) or are sent to a back-end logging system,
such as the venerable &ldquo;syslog&rdquo; facility that Linux provides.
But, one
of the surprises and frustrations that Web developers encounter is that
there is no such thing as a &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; in which their Web application
is running. Rather, the Web server sends its error messages somewhere
else entirely, to one or more files.
</p><p>
I often tell participants in my Web development courses that they should
embrace their new best friend, the logfile. And, indeed, logfiles are
a priceless tool in the hands of a developer, making it possible&mdash;like a doctor&mdash;to understand the source of a problem and then
diagnose and fix it. Because there is no way to interact directly
with a Web server, looking at the effects as displayed in the logfile
is the best way to understand what is happening. Through the years, I've
learned, however, 
that developers often are unfamiliar with many of the
issues having to do with logging and how they can make the best
use of those logs to ensure that their programs run as smoothly as
possible.
</p><p>
So in this article, I look at a number of issues having to do 
with logging, as well as some strategies and techniques you can use
to make best use of the logs. Some of the things I 
mention here are specific to the Ruby on Rails framework, which I use in
much of my day-to-day work, but several techniques are common to many
packages or to programming in general.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x130d670"></a>
Where Are You Logging?</h2></div></div><p>
A typical modern Web application consists of a database server, an
HTTP server and an application. For example, I generally use
PostgreSQL (database), Apache (HTTP) and Ruby on Rails (application),
but it's not unusual for me to use other technologies, from MySQL and
MongoDB to other languages, servers and systems. Each program has
its own logfile, with its own configuration settings and output
syntax.
</p><p>
The first thing you should do when working on a project, whether
you are starting it or taking it over from someone else, is determine
which logfiles are being written to. In a Web application that uses
Apache, Rails and PostgreSQL, you'll have at least three different
logfiles, one for each of these programs.
</p><p>
Sometimes these logfiles are placed under the /var/log directory in
your filesystem, but not always. It's not unusual for a PostgreSQL
logfile to be in the &ldquo;data directory&rdquo;, which on my systems
often is in
/usr/local/pgsql/data. Note that the default location for a program's
logfiles might not match the location that your Linux distribution has
adopted, so unless you're careful, you can end up with two separate
logfile directories, one of which is ignored by the system.
</p><p>
Some programs can create more than one logfile. Apache is able to act
as an HTTP server for multiple sites, and it's often helpful to be
able to separate out logs for those sites. And, Apache also separates
HTTP request logs from errors and referrers, meaning that if you want
to understand fully what is happening on your site, you might need to
piece together several logs just for the HTTP server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x130d8d8"></a>
Apache Logs</h2></div></div><p>
The two most important logs that Apache produces are the request log
and the error log. A typical line in the request log (using the
&ldquo;common format&rdquo;, which combines referrer information with requests)
represents a single HTTP transaction and looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
84.108.219.125 - - [09/Jan/2012:14:13:52 +0200] 
 &#8618;"GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 764 "http://linuxjournal.com/"
"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/535.11 
 &#8618;(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/17.0.963.26 Safari/535.11"
</pre>
</p><p>
The most important elements of this entry are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The request was made from IP address 84.108.219.125.
</p></li><li><p>
The request took place at 14:13:52, UTC + 2.
</p></li><li><p>
The GET method was used to request /, using HTTP 1.1.
</p></li><li><p>
The return code was 200.
</p></li><li><p>
The response contained 764 bytes.
</p></li><li><p>
The user came to this page from a link at LinuxJournal.com.
</p></li><li><p>
The user was browsing with the Safari browser, on an Intel-based Mac.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The access log can be useful for a number of reasons. First,
I'm often trying to debug the HTTP requests that a program makes to a
server. This can be as mundane as when I click on a link in my
browser or when I'm writing a program that is trying to retrieve
information from a server. The HTTP access log shows me precisely
what URL was sent to the server; I frequently have been able to debug
problems with the requesting program as a result.
</p><p>
Of course, only GET requests, in which name-value pairs are part of
the URL, are debugged easily in the access log. POST requests send
their name-value pairs on a separate channel, which means you
can't rely on the server log to display them.
</p><p>
It's also easy to assemble basic statistics about a site by looking
at the Apache logs. For example, from my server, the response code is
column #9 of the logfile. By chaining together several command-line
tools, I can find out what percentage of each request got each
response:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cut --fields=9 --delimiter=' ' access.log   | sort | uniq  -c
</pre>
</p><p>
First, I use <tt  >cut</tt> to divide the logfile into fields, separated by
spaces. Next, I grab the 9th column, which corresponds to the HTTP
response code. I then sort those codes and use <tt  >uniq</tt> to count the
number of times each one appears.
</p><p>
The other important Apache logfile, and one that is crucial in
debugging Web applications, is the error log. Not only does this file
mention many errors and warnings that Apache has encountered, but
also anything that the Web application might have sent to the STDERR
filehandle while executing. If something goes wrong on a Web
application that I'm developing, my first instinct is to look at the
error log. Often messages
there will give me an indication of what is happening, including
warnings of errors, incorrect HTTP headers or truncated requests.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x130e380"></a>
Application Logs</h2></div></div><p>
For many years, the Apache error log was the best tool I had
for debugging Web applications. Modern Web frameworks
operate outside Apache (or any other HTTP server) though and
often have their own logfiles. Ruby on Rails, for example, has a
separate logfile for each of its environments. Thus, under the logs
directory, you typically will find development.log, production.log
and test.log.
</p><p>
The test environment is where you run your tests, and having a
full-fledged logfile that I can open and peruse after tests have
failed makes it relatively easy to figure out why they didn't work.
The test logfile generally is full of enough detail that if something
goes wrong, you can reproduce it in the console and understand why it
didn't work.
</p><p>
The development log also is full of useful information. Although it
reflects whatever requests you make to the development server, it
offers a chance for more insight. For example, the default setting in
Ruby on Rails gives a huge amount of information about database access
via ActiveRecord, including the SQL that ultimately is sent to the
server and when objects are fetched from ActiveRecord's cache, rather
than from the database itself. When I'm developing a Web app, it's
very common for me to do a <tt  >tail -f</tt> (more on that below) on the Web
application log.
</p><p>
The production log, as its name implies, is written to the production
server. On systems with more than one production server, it can become
tricky to keep track of multiple logs, because you cannot know to
which production server given users will be sending their HTTP
requests. In such instances, using a system that allows you to
aggregate logs in a single place, such as syslog or Graylog2 (which I
haven't ever used, but it looks like a marvelous system), might well
come in handy. When I have a small number of servers, I often
take the easy way out, putting the production logs separately on each
server and then just looking at both via <tt  >tail -f</tt> to see where a
problem might have cropped up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x130e698"></a>
Database Logs</h2></div></div><p>
Most modern Web applications use a database of some sort. These 
often are relational databases, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. Each of
these databases has a variety of switches and configuration variables
that you can set to describe and customize the ways in which logfiles
are written.
</p><p>
I tend to use PostgreSQL whenever possible and generally set up the logs
the same way on all systems I run. I turn logging on and configure
the logs to rotate once per day, such that I have the last seven days'
worth of logs if I ever need to check on something.
</p><p>
One of the nicest things about PostgreSQL's logs is that you can
decide what you want to log&mdash;connections, disconnections, query
parse trees, statement durations, vacuum execution or even the output
from the query optimizer. These settings are in the postgresql.conf
configuration file, which normally sits in the data directory,
alongside the security configuration file pg_hba.conf.
</p><p>
By setting the appropriate variables in postgresql.conf, you can set
separate log levels for client connections (client_min_messages) and
the logfile (log_min_messages), such that the logfile contains more
detail than messages sent to database clients. You can ask for log
messages to be displayed verbosely (log_error_verbosity), which gives
a level of detail I've never found useful, but which undoubtedly
comes in handy when doing low-level database hacking.
</p><p>
The log_statement parameter allows you to log DDL (database
definition statements), mod (modifications to the database) or
everything.
</p><p>
One of the most useful log-related settings in the PostgreSQL
configuration file is log_min_duration_statement. By default, it is
set to &ndash;1, meaning that it is deactivated. Given a positive number as
a parameter, this will log any time a statement on your PostgreSQL
server takes longer than a certain number of milliseconds. I normally
set this to 100ms and then can go through the logfile (using grep,
searching for the word &ldquo;duration&rdquo;) to find which queries are taking
the longest. That allows me to concentrate my efforts on the slowest
queries, as identified by the database server itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x130ea08"></a>
How to Read Logs</h2></div></div><p>
One of the best ways to read through logfiles is also the easiest,
namely the <tt  >less</tt> command.
<tt  >less</tt>, which is a modern replacement for
the traditional UNIX <tt  >more</tt> command, lets you page through a file,
backward and forward&mdash;and if the file grows while you're viewing
it, <tt  >less</tt> still will let you read through it, including to the current
end of the file.
</p><p>
<tt  >less</tt> has a very large number of options that you can apply. For
years, my .zshrc profile has defined the PAGER environment variable to
be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
less -RXs
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x1706fc8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This means it shows raw control characters (useful for reading
colorized logs and man pages), that it doesn't reset the terminal
(which I admit I use out of habit, rather than having demonstrated
with certainty that this option is necessary), and that multiple blank
lines will be squeezed into a second one. The fact that searching in
<tt  >less</tt> not only supports regular expressions, but also highlights any
text that matches my search, makes it fairly easy to find my way
around.
</p><p>
However, I often want to read the logs as they come through. One easy
way to do this is with <tt  >tail -f</tt>. The
<tt  >tail</tt> command shows you the
final lines of a file on your filesystem. The <tt  >-f</tt> flag tells Linux
to keep reading from the file as it grows and to print it on the
screen. When I'm developing, I often have one terminal window open
on the application's logfile with <tt  >tail -f</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f log/production.log
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're on a heavily loaded server, the output from <tt  >tail
-f</tt>
not only will slow down your machine, but also will be unreadable by you.
The solution is to filter the output of <tt  >tail -f</tt>
through <tt  >grep</tt>, looking
for a particular piece of text that is of interest to you, such as the name of a
variable, function or error message.
</p><p>
If you want to grab a bunch of lines, you can use grep's
<tt  >-A</tt>
(after), <tt  >-B</tt> (before) or <tt  >-C</tt> (context = before + after) flags. For
example, if you want to see the list of parameters sent to your Web
application server every time the Home#index method is called, you can
do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f log/production.log | grep -A10 Home#index
</pre>
</p><p>
Do you really need ten lines after the method name is printed in the
logs? Probably not, but this ensures that you'll get all of the
parameters, without having to read through lots of other stuff.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x17076a8"></a>
Writing to Logs</h2></div></div><p>
It might sound odd, but it takes some practice to learn how to write
to logfiles as well. I tend to write a lot of information to logs
when I'm developing a Web application. I realize there are people
for whom a debugger is their first tool of choice, but mine is the
console that Rails provides, followed closely behind by the logfiles.
From a Rails application, you can write to the log at any point using
the &ldquo;logger&rdquo; object, which is defined in all models and controllers.
The logger object supports a method for each log level, from
&ldquo;crit&rdquo;
(critical) to &ldquo;info&rdquo;, and everywhere in between. So to write
&ldquo;hello&rdquo;
into the logs, you would write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn "hello"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, whatever you write to the logs is printed verbatim. You can, of
course, write the value of a variable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn some_variable
</pre>
</p><p>
But, this is almost always a bad way to go. First, you want to
be able to find what you've written to the logfile. Second, you're
probably going to be writing multiple variable values, so you will
want to indicate what you're printing here to distinguish it from
other places. And finally, if the variable value is blank, or a
newline, you'll want to know that&mdash;most easily by putting its value
between delimiters. So when I want to print a variable value, I do
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn "[ObjectName#method_name] some_variable 
 &#8618;= '#{some_variable}'"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I easily can find this value in the logfile; I can know in which
method I was printing things, and I also can distinguish between
different values&mdash;an empty string, a space or a newline.
</p><p>
If it's a complicated variable, I sometimes use the built-in
<tt  >to_json</tt> or <tt  >to_yaml</tt> methods that Rails provides:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn "[ObjectName#method_name] some_variable =
 &#8618;'#{some_variable.to_yaml}'"
</pre>
</p><p>
But watch out! I've learned the hard way that certain objects cannot
be printed to YAML. What happens in those cases is that you get an
error message instead of a printout, and that can cause more
head-scratching, trying to figure out how and where you introduced a
new bug. Printing things simply, in non-YAML format, is generally a
good idea, when you can get away with it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1215580.0x1707cd8"></a>
Logging Every Action</h2></div></div><p>
On some projects, I go all-out, logging every HTTP request to the
database. This is a tremendous help when debugging applications,
although it does tend to have the side effect of slowing things down,
because each request needs to write to the database. (Using a
non-relational database probably would be a faster way to go about
this, although I enjoy using the powerful queries that SQL provides
when I need to pull information out.) When I do this, I typically
create a logged_actions table in the database, containing the
following columns:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
user_id.
</p></li><li><p>
controller name.
</p></li><li><p>
action name.
</p></li><li><p>
logged_at (timestamp).
</p></li><li><p>
message (allows me to stick an arbitrary message into these logs).
</p></li><li><p>
ip_address (of the person requesting).
</p></li><li><p>
browser_info (from the user's browser).
</p></li><li><p>
URL.
</p></li><li><p>
params (all of the parameters sent, via GET and POST).
</p></li><li><p>
session (the user's entire session, written in YAML if possible).
</p></li><li><p>
cookies (the user's cookies, written in YAML if possible).
</p></li><li><p>
flash (contents of the Rails &ldquo;flash&rdquo;, a sort of temporary
session).
</p></li><li><p>
referrer.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I then create a &ldquo;before filter&rdquo; in the application controller, such
that every single request to the Web application results in an entry
in the Logged_Actions table. Moreover, whenever I want to add some
debugging or other information, I put it into the logs in the usual
way, or I can write it with much more information and context via my
Logged_Actions table. This table, and the entries in it, have proved
to be extremely valuable in many cases, allowing me to debug problems
that otherwise would have been difficult to revisit or understand.
</p><p>
When I'm not debugging, I often turn this feature off, given the
combination of overhead that it causes and the potential
privacy/security issues that it can sometimes raise. In some cases,
I've configured this before filter based on a configuration parameter
that I set elsewhere in the system, such that I can turn fine-grained
logging on and off without having to modify and re-deploy the
application.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you are a Web developer, and if you aren't yet using logfiles as
part of your development and debugging process, I strongly
suggest you begin to do so. Logfiles are a gold mine of
information in all cases, but when you start to track and write
additional messages, you give yourself the ability to discover and fix
problems even before your users are aware of them happening. Plus, if
you keep track of users' parameters and request information, you can
often discover, as I have, that sometimes the problem has to do with
something in users' sessions or histories, or even the browsers
they are using to visit your site.

Logging is a broad topic, but one of the best treatments and
discussions I've recently encountered was on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ruby Rogues</em></span>
podcast. Episode 25 was about logging and had an in-depth discussion
of what to log, how to log and various tools that have to do with
logging.
</p><p>
Apache has a very flexible logging system. If you are running the
latest (2.2) version of Apache HTTPD, read the documentation at
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html" target="_self">httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html</a>.
</p><p>
The Graylog2 Project, although I haven't used it myself, looks like a
great way to both store large volumes of logging information, and then
produce reports and analysis based on it. It's worth looking into,
at <a href="http://graylog2.org" target="_self">graylog2.org</a>.
</p><p>
A highly sophisticated and mature logging system for Java, known as
Log4j, is run by the Apache Software Foundation at
<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j" target="_self">logging.apache.org/log4j</a>. There are versions of log4j in many
other languages, including Python, Ruby and Perl, giving you the
ability to write different types of levels of messages to different
destinations.
</p><p>
Finally, you can read more about PostgreSQL's logging capabilities in
the documentation. Look for &ldquo;Error Reporting and Logging&rdquo; in the
manual, which is always available at <a href="http://postgresql.org" target="_self">postgresql.org</a>.
