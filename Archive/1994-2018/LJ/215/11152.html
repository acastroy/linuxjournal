This installment covers booting in EFI mode, quirks of
different distributions in EFI mode and converting a
BIOS-based installation to boot in EFI mode.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2a4b250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In Part II of this series in the January 2012 issue, I described the prerequisites for installing Linux on a
computer that uses an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) or Unified EFI
(UEFI) as opposed to a more traditional Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
firmware. If you're lucky, you might be able to forego some of these
preparatory steps, because your distribution's installer might boot properly
and manage the steps correctly. All too often though, Linux distributions
handle these tasks poorly enough that you'll want to prepare your computer
first by partitioning manually and determining how to boot your computer in
UEFI mode for installation&mdash;or in BIOS mode, in some cases.
</p><p>
In this article, I look at the nuts and bolts of installing Linux on an
EFI-based computer. The topics I cover are booting in EFI mode; quirks of
Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and OpenSUSE in EFI mode; and converting a
BIOS-based installation to boot in EFI mode. My next article will conclude this
series with a look at the tools and techniques you can use to troubleshoot
and keep an EFI-based Linux installation working correctly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2a4b460"></a>
Booting in EFI Mode</h2></div></div><p>
In most cases, launching a Linux installer on an EFI-based computer is just
like launching the same installer on a BIOS-based computer. You insert the
disc, boot the computer and perhaps select a boot-time option to boot from
the optical disc rather than from a hard disk. On most UEFI-based PCs, you
must be sure to use a 64-bit version of your distribution; the 32-bit
versions usually lack EFI boot files, and such files generally are useful
only on early Intel-based Macs in any event.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the fact that most EFI implementations provide a BIOS
compatibility mode (also known as a Compatibility Support Module, or CSM)
can make it hard to control whether your computer boots using EFI or BIOS
mode. I've heard of some implementations that provide such poor control
that the only way to switch modes is to employ tricks like rebuilding the
installation medium to omit the files for the mode you don't want to
use!
In most cases though, firmware boot options provide some way to launch the
disc in one mode or another (as described in Part II of this series).
</p><p>
Some distributions, such as Debian, don't yet ship with any EFI boot
support, at least not for the x86-64 platform. With such distributions, you
have three choices:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You can install Linux in BIOS mode and continue booting in BIOS mode,
ignoring the computer's EFI features.
</p></li><li><p>
You can install Linux in BIOS mode and then convert the working
installation to boot in EFI mode, if this is necessary or desirable.
</p></li><li><p>
You can install an EFI bootloader on your hard disk or installation
medium and use that to boot the installer in EFI mode. (Part II of this
series covered EFI bootloader installation.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Which method works best depends on your computer and your needs. For
instance, BIOS-mode booting is usually fine for a Linux-only installation,
although it's a bit slower than a native EFI boot. You even can use the
GUID Partition Table (GPT) on your disks, if necessary. If you have a
working EFI-mode Windows installation though, switching between EFI- and
BIOS-mode boots for the two OSes may be awkward.
</p><p>
If you're not sure whether your distribution supports EFI-mode boot, you can
check the files on the installation disc. Discs that support EFI-mode boots
typically include files with names that end in &ldquo;efi&rdquo;, such as
boot/x86_64/efi (OpenSUSE) or EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.efi (Fedora or, in all
lowercase, Ubuntu). In actuality, EFI-bootable discs use a secondary El
Torito entry, so these files might not be present in the main ISO-9660
filesystem, but they usually are. If you don't see such files, you can try
booting the disc, but if it boots, you might be left with the question of
whether it booted in BIOS mode or in EFI mode. To make this determination,
try this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Boot the installation disc.
</p></li><li><p>
Switch to a text-mode console by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F2 (or some other
function key, if F2 doesn't work).
</p></li><li><p>
Type <tt  >dmesg | grep EFI</tt>.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
If the dmesg command produces no output, or perhaps just one or two lines,
you've booted in BIOS mode. If the dmesg output includes numerous
lines, most of which relate to memory mappings, you've booted in EFI
mode. An example EFI boot might include lines like these (the full output
is much longer than this):

<pre     class="programlisting">
[    0.000000] Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=
               atapi2:\EFI\ELILO\bzImage-3.0.4
	       root=/dev/seeker/u1104  ro
[    0.000000] EFI v2.00 by American Megatrends
[    0.000000] Kernel-defined memdesc doesn't match
               the one from EFI!
[    0.000000] EFI: mem00: type=3, attr=0xf, range=
             [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000048000)
	       (0MB)
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you've verified that you've booted in EFI mode, you can press Alt-F7
(or Alt-F1 in Fedora) to return to the installer and proceed with
installation. Alternatively, on some systems, it may be easier to install
Linux in BIOS mode and then install an EFI-capable bootloader to enable
the computer to boot in that way. Such a switch is especially likely to be
useful with Debian and Ubuntu installs, as I describe shortly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2a4bda8"></a>
Debian's EFI Support</h2></div></div><p>
As of version 6.0.3, you can install Debian on an EFI system in EFI mode,
but only by adding your own EFI bootloader; the standard install DVD image
lacks this critical feature. To do a native EFI installation, you can
install ELILO (or another bootloader, if you prefer) to the computer's EFI
System Partition (ESP), as described in Part II of this series. You must copy the vmlinuz
and initrd.gz files from the disc's install.amd subdirectory (assuming an
x86-64 installation) as the kernel and initial RAM disk files. You can omit
the <tt  >root=</tt> line in the elilo.conf file.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the reward for making this extra effort is an installer
that runs but has some serious bugs, which are identical to those for
Ubuntu. I describe them shortly in the Ubuntu section, because Ubuntu
officially supports booting its standard installation discs in EFI mode. In
addition, the Debian installer installs a BIOS version of GRUB, so you'll
need to install an EFI-capable bootloader manually when you're done.
</p><p>
Instead of installing Debian in EFI mode, it's usually easier and safer,
particularly for multiboot systems, to install the OS in BIOS mode,
install an EFI-enabled bootloader, and then switch the computer into EFI
boot mode to use the computer in this way. I cover this procedure in more
detail later.
</p><p>
Debian's repositories include ELILO (elilo), the EFI-enabled version of
GRUB 2 (grub-efi) and rEFIt (refit), so you can install any of these via
packages. However, you will need to copy the relevant files to the ESP, as
described in Part II of this series.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2a4c068"></a>
Ubuntu's EFI Support</h2></div></div><p>
As of version 11.10, Ubuntu can install directly in EFI mode, and on a
single-boot computer, such an installation can work fairly well. One
important caveat exists: if you use the advanced partitioning option
(called &ldquo;Something Else&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Installation
Type&rdquo; screen), you must
identify the ESP as such by selecting the ESP, clicking Change and
selecting &ldquo;EFI Boot Partition&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Use As&rdquo; field, as shown in Figure 1.
If you don't identify the ESP in this way, the installer won't install the
bootloader to the ESP, rendering the system unbootable. If this happens,
you can install a bootloader using an emergency boot system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11152f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Ubuntu identifies the
ESP as an &ldquo;EFI boot partition&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><p>
Another problem is that if you don't create an ESP before you begin the
installation, Ubuntu creates one that's on the small side&mdash;often well
under 100 MiB, depending on your hard disk's size. Such a small ESP is fine
if you use Ubuntu's GRUB 2 bootloader, but not if you use ELILO. Thus, I
recommend creating an ESP before you begin the Ubuntu installation process.
</p><p>
More serious complications arise in a multiboot environment. Specifically,
when you properly identify the ESP, Ubuntu creates a fresh FAT-16
filesystem on the ESP. This has two undesirable consequences:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
If you install Ubuntu after another OS, the Ubuntu installation process
destroys your existing OS's bootloader.
</p></li><li><p>
If you install Ubuntu before Windows 7, the Windows installer may not
like the fact that the ESP uses FAT-16&mdash;Windows 7 is a stickler for the
ESP being FAT-32. The result is that Windows either will complain that
there's no ESP or it will create a new ESP, proceed most of the way
through the installation and become confused late in the process. Either
way, the result is a failed Windows installation.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Several workarounds to this problem exist, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You can install Windows (or any other OS) first, back up the ESP, install
Ubuntu, and then restore the backed-up ESP files atop the Ubuntu ESP
files. This procedure works well, but it leaves the ESP as a FAT-16
partition, which could cause problems if you need to re-install Windows
in the future.
</p></li><li><p>
You can install Ubuntu first, back up its ESP, create a fresh FAT-32
filesystem on the ESP, restore the ESP files, edit /etc/fstab to mount
the ESP using its new UUID value, and then install your other OSes.
</p></li><li><p>
You can install Ubuntu and deliberately <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> identify
the ESP, or
you can install it in BIOS mode rather than in EFI mode. Either way, this
will leave the ESP untouched. You then will have to install a
bootloader manually.
</p></li><li><p>
You can prepare a FAT-32 ESP, and when you install Ubuntu, deliberately
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> identify the ESP. Once you've passed the partitioning screen,
press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to open a text-mode terminal and manually mount the ESP
at /target/boot/efi. The installer then will add Ubuntu's GRUB 2 to the
ESP but leave its existing contents untouched. In many ways, this is the
best solution, but it requires that you be prompt in manually mounting
the ESP.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
By default, Ubuntu uses GRUB 2 as its EFI bootloader, installed from a
package called grub-efi. Ubuntu also provides elilo and refit packages,
should you prefer one of these bootloaders; however, Ubuntu's package
management system includes scripts to update the GRUB 2 configuration when
you upgrade a kernel, and these scripts won't update an ELILO
configuration. Thus, if you want the easiest configuration, GRUB 2 has an
edge. On the other hand, GRUB 2 is less reliable than ELILO, in my
experience. Overall, I recommend you try GRUB 2, and if it gives you
problems, switch to ELILO (with rEFIt, if necessary, to select a non-Linux
OS).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2a4cbc0"></a>
Fedora's EFI Support</h2></div></div><p>
Fedora 16 provides the most complete and reliable EFI support during
installation of any of the distributions described here. Unlike Ubuntu,
Fedora doesn't replace a working ESP with a new one; it adds its own files
to the working ESP, as a well-behaved EFI OS installer should. Fedora does,
however, have a tendency to create ESPs that are on the large side&mdash;often
well over a gigabyte. Also, if you install in BIOS mode to a GPT disk,
Fedora mis-labels its /boot partition (or the Fedora root, /, partition if
you don't create a separate /boot partition) as an ESP. This last bug
doesn't affect native EFI installations.
</p><p>
Fedora uses a modified version of GRUB Legacy on its EFI installations.
(Fedora 16 has changed to GRUB 2 for BIOS installations, but has stuck with
its modified GRUB Legacy for EFI.) This configuration works well on most
systems in my experience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2e44f70"></a>
OpenSUSE's EFI Support</h2></div></div><p>
OpenSUSE 12.1 supports EFI installation, although the installer creates a
new ESP even if a valid one already exists. What's more, the ESP that
OpenSUSE creates is a bit small (156 MiB) and is FAT-16. As noted with
respect to Ubuntu, a FAT-16 ESP can cause problems if you subsequently
attempt to install Windows on the computer. You can work around some of
these problems by using the manual partitioning option, but that creates
other problems if you're starting from scratch. For instance, the manual
partitioner sets the wrong type codes on most of the partitions it creates,
and you can only force it to create a FAT-32 filesystem by making the
partition bigger than about 520 MiB. Therefore, if you need to dual-boot
with Windows, it's probably best to prepare your partitions before you run
the OpenSUSE installer and then use the manual partitioning option to
identify each partition to the installer. (You can identify the ESP by
telling OpenSUSE to mount it at /boot/efi.)
</p><p>
OpenSUSE uses ELILO as its default EFI bootloader. ELILO generally works
well, in my experience. If you dual-boot with another OS, though, you'll
need to replace or supplement ELILO, since it doesn't support chainloading
to another OS's bootloader.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2e450d0"></a>
Converting an Existing System to Boot with EFI</h2></div></div><p>
Because of the bugs in so many distributions' installers' EFI support, it's
often better to install the OS in BIOS mode and then convert it to use an
EFI bootloader than it is to install directly in EFI mode. You may need to
perform such a conversion if you have a working system that you want to
begin booting in EFI mode. Fortunately, Linux can switch between BIOS and
EFI booting with no problems, provided you have both BIOS and EFI
bootloaders installed. (If you're converting permanently, you can uninstall the
BIOS bootloader when you're done with the conversion.)
</p><p>
If you're starting from scratch, the easiest way to proceed is as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Partition your disk as described in Part II, with a 200&ndash;300 MiB ESP and
whatever partitions you need for Linux. If your distribution uses GRUB
2, you also should create a 1 MiB BIOS Boot Partition, which is
identified by a bios_grub flag in parted or GParted or by a type code
of EF02 in GPT fdisk (gdisk, cgdisk or sgdisk).
</p></li><li><p>
Boot the Linux installer and verify that it's running in BIOS mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Install Linux normally. The result should boot in BIOS mode, but not
in EFI mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Mount your ESP at /boot/efi, creating that mountpoint if necessary.
You also should create an /etc/fstab entry to make this configuration
permanent.
</p></li><li><p>
Install an EFI bootloader. Part II of this series described how to
install ELILO, but you can install another bootloader if you prefer.
If you install GRUB 2 using your distribution's packaging system, the
package name probably will be grub-efi, and it may replace the BIOS
version of GRUB 2, grub-pc. This can render the computer unbootable in
BIOS mode, so you should be careful if you use this option. Note that because efibootmgr won't work in BIOS mode, you'll probably have to
install the bootloader as /boot/efi/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi.
</p></li><li><p>
Reboot and activate EFI boot mode in your firmware. With any luck,
you'll see your Linux bootloader and be able to boot into Linux in EFI
mode. If not, Part IV of this series will provide some troubleshooting tips.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
At this point, you can verify that you booted in EFI mode by examining your
dmesg output, as described earlier. You then can add or change
bootloaders&mdash;say, adding rEFIt if you want to dual-boot with Windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2953580.0x2e45758"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
GPT on BIOS</b></p><p>
Some EFI-capable firmwares have problems booting from GPT disks in BIOS
mode because of BIOS bugs. You often can overcome this problem by setting
the boot flag (aka the active flag) on the 0xEE partition in the
disk's <span   class="emphasis"><em>protective MBR</em></span>, which is a part of the disk that's intended
to keep older GPT-unaware utilities from messing with a GPT disk. To do
this, use Linux's fdisk utility:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Type <tt  >fdisk /dev/sda</tt> to launch fdisk.
</p></li><li><p>
Type <tt  >a</tt> followed by <tt  >1</tt> for the partition number. (The 0xEE partition
is almost always partition #1.)
</p></li><li><p>
Type <tt  >w</tt> to save your changes.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Thereafter, the computer should boot fine in BIOS mode from the disk. Be
aware that some GPT partitioning tools will undo this change, so you may
need to re-enable it. Note that you should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> attempt to use GNU
Parted, GParted or any other libparted-based tool to do this; they won't
work.
