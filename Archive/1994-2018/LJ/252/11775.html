A new approach to real-time security-wise virtualization in Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f51f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Because you're a reader of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, you probably
already know that Linux has a rich virtualization
ecosystem. KVM is the de facto standard, and VirtualBox is widely used for desktop
virtualization. Veterans should remember Xen (it's still in a good shape,
by the way), and there is also VMware (which isn't free but runs on Linux
as well). Plus, there are many lesser-known hypervisors
like the educational lguest or hobbyist Xvisor. In such a crowded landscape,
is there a place for a newcomer?
</p><p>
There likely is not much sense in creating yet another Linux-based
&ldquo;versatile&rdquo; hypervisor (other than doing it just for fun, you
know). But,
there are some specific use cases that general-purpose solutions just don't
address quite well. One such area is real-time virtualization, which is
frequently used in industrial automation, medicine, telecommunications
and high-performance computing. In these applications, dedicating a
whole CPU or its core to the software that runs bare metal (with no
underlying OS) is a way to meet strict deadline requirements. Although it
is possible to pin a KVM instance to the processor core and pass through PCI
devices to guests, tests show the worst-case latency may be above
some realistic requirements (see Resources). 
</p><p>
As usual with free software, the situation
is getting better with time, but there is one other thing&mdash;security. Sensitive software systems go through rigorous
certifications (like Common Criteria) or even formal verification
procedures. If you want them to run virtualized (say, for consolidation
purposes), the hypervisor must isolate them from non-certifiable
workloads. This implies that the hypervisor itself must be small enough;
otherwise, it may end up being larger (and more &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo;) than the
software it segregates, thus devastating the whole idea of isolation.
</p><p>
So, it looks like there is some room for a lightweight (for the real-time
camp), small and simple (for security folks) open-source Linux-friendly
hypervisor for real-time and certifiable workloads. That's where
Jailhouse comes into play.

New Guy on the Block</h2></div></div><p>
Jailhouse was born at Siemens and has been developed as a free software project
(GPLv2) since November 2013. Last August, Jailhouse 0.1 was released to
the general public. Jailhouse is rather young and more of a research project
than a ready-to-use tool at this point, but now is a good time to become acquainted it 
and be prepared to meet it in production.
</p><p>
From the technical point of view, Jailhouse is a static partitioning
hypervisor that runs bare metal but cooperates closely with Linux. This
means Jailhouse doesn't emulate resources you don't have. It just
splits your hardware into isolated compartments called &ldquo;cells&rdquo; that
are wholly dedicated to guest software programs called
&ldquo;inmates&rdquo;. One
of these cells runs the Linux OS and is known as the &ldquo;root
cell&rdquo;. Other cells
borrow CPUs and devices from the root cell as they are created (Figure
1). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><object data="11775f1.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object><div class="caption"><p>

the Jailhouse hypervisor (b) alongside a real-time application. (Image from
Yulia Sinitsyna;
Tux image from Larry Ewing.)
</p></div></div><p>
Besides Linux, Jailhouse supports bare-metal applications,
but it can't run general-purpose OSes (like Windows or FreeBSD) unmodified.
As mentioned, there are plenty of other options if you need that. One day
Jailhouse also may support running KVM in the root cell, thus delivering
the best of both worlds.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, Jailhouse cooperates closely with Linux and relies on it
for hardware bootstrapping, hypervisor launch and doing management tasks
(like creating new cells). Bootstrapping is really essential here, as it
is a rather complex task for modern computers, and implementing it within
Jailhouse would make it much more complex. That being said, Jailhouse
doesn't meld with the kernel as KVM (which is a kernel module) does. It
is loaded as a firmware image (the same way Wi-Fi adapters load their
firmware blobs) and resides in a dedicated memory region that you should
reserve at Linux boot time. Jailhouse's kernel module (jailhouse.ko,
also called &ldquo;driver&rdquo;) loads the firmware and creates /dev/jailhouse
device, which the Jailhouse userspace tool uses, but it doesn't contain any
hypervisor logic.
</p><p>
Jailhouse is an example of Asynchronous Multiprocessing (AMP)
architecture. Compared to traditional Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
systems, CPU cores in Jailhouse are not treated equally. Cores 0
and 1 may run Linux and have access to a SATA hard drive, while core 2
runs a bare-metal application that has access only to a serial port. As
most computers Jailhouse can run on have shared L2/L3 caches, this means
there is a possibility for cache thrashing. To understand why this happens,
consider that Jailhouse maps the same guest physical memory address (GPA)
to a different host (or real) physical address for different inmates. If
two inmates occasionally have the same GPA (naturally containing diverse
data) in the same L2/L3 cache line due to cache associativity, they will
interfere with each other's work and degrade the performance. This effect is
yet to be measured, and Jailhouse currently has no dedicated means to
mitigate it. However, there is a hope that for many applications, this
performance loss won't be crucial.
</p><p>
Now that you have enough background to understand what Jailhouse is (and what
it isn't), I hope you are interested in learning more. Let's see how to
install and run it on your system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f5bf0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Getting Up to Date</b></p><p>
Sometimes you may need the very latest KVM and QEMU to give Jailhouse a 
try. KVM is part of the kernel, and updating the critical system component
just to try some new software probably seems like overkill. Luckily,
there is another way.
</p><p>
kvm-kmod is a tool to take KVM modules from one kernel and compile 
them for another, and it usually is used to build the latest KVM for your
current kernel. The build process is detailed in the README, but in 
a nutshell, you clone the repository, initialize a submodule (it's the 
source for KVM), and run the configure script followed by
<tt  >make</tt>. When the modules
are ready, just <tt  >insmod</tt> them instead of what your distribution provides 
(don't forget to unload those first). If you want the change to be permanent,
run <tt  >make modules_install</tt>. kvm-kmod can take the KVM
sources from wherever you
point to, but the defaults are usually sufficient.
</p><p>
Compiling QEMU is easier but more time consuming. It follows 
the usual <tt  >configure &amp;&amp; make</tt> procedure, and
it doesn't need to be
installed system-wide (which is package manager-friendly). Just put
<tt  >/path/to/qemu/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64</tt> instead of plain
<tt  >qemu-system-x86_64</tt> in the text's examples.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26f60c0"></a>
Building Jailhouse</h2></div></div><p>
Despite having a 0.1 release now, Jailhouse still is a young project
that is being developed at a quick pace. You are unlikely to find it in your
distribution's repositories for the same reasons, so the preferred way
to get Jailhouse is to build it from Git.
</p><p>
To run Jailhouse, you'll need a recent multicore VT-x-enabled Intel x86
64-bit CPU and a motherboard with VT-d support. By the time you read
this article, 64-bit AMD CPUs and even ARM (v7 or better) could be supported as
well. The code is already here (see Resources), but it's not integrated into the mainline
yet. At least 1GB of RAM is recommended, and even more is needed for the
nested setup I
discuss below. On the software side, you'll need the usual developer tools
(make, GCC, Git) and headers for your Linux kernel.
</p><p>
Running Jailhouse on real hardware isn't straightforward at this time,
so if you just want to play with it, there is a better alternative. Given
that you meet CPU requirements, the hypervisor should run well under
KVM/QEMU. This is known as a nested setup. Jailhouse relies on some
bleeding-edge features, so you'll need at least Linux 3.17 and QEMU
2.1 for everything to work smoothly. Unless you are on a rolling release
distribution, this could be a problem, so you may want to compile these
tools yourself. See the Getting Up to Date sidebar for more information, and I suggest you
have a look at it even if you are lucky enough to have the required
versions pre-packaged. Jailhouse evolves and may need yet unreleased
features and fixes by the time you read this.
</p><p>
Make sure you have nested mode enabled in KVM. Both kvm-intel and
kvm-amd kernel modules accept the <tt  >nested=1</tt>
parameter, which is responsible
just for that. You can set it manually, on the modprobe command line (don't
forget to unload the previous module's instance first). Alternatively, add
<tt  >options kvm-intel nested=1</tt> (or the similar kvm-amd line) to a new file
under /etc/modprobe.d.
</p><p>
You also should reserve memory for Jailhouse and the inmates. To do this,
simply add <tt  >memmap=66M$0x3b000000</tt> to the kernel command line. For one-time
usage, do this from the GRUB menu (press e, edit the command line and then
press F10). To make the change persistent, edit the
<tt  >GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</tt> 
variable in /etc/default/grub on the QEMU guest side and regenerate the
configuration with <tt  >grub-mkconfig</tt>.
</p><p>
Now, make a JeOS edition of your favorite distribution. You can produce
one with SUSE Studio, ubuntu-vm-builder and similar, or just install a
minimal system the ordinary way yourself. It is recommended to have the
same kernel on the host and inside QEMU. Now, run the virtual machine as
(Intel CPU assumed):


<pre     class="programlisting">
qemu-system-x86_64 -machine q35 -m 1G -enable-kvm -smp 4 
  &#8618;-cpu kvm64,-kvm_pv_eoi,-kvm_steal_time,-kvm_asyncpf,
&#8618;-kvmclock,+vmx,+x2apic -drive 
 &#8618;file=LinuxInstallation.img,id=disk,if=none 
 &#8618;-virtfs local,path=/path/to/jailhouse,
&#8618;security_model=passthrough,mount_tag=host 
 &#8618;-device ide-hd,drive=disk -serial stdio 
 &#8618;-serial file:com2.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Note, I enabled 9p (-virtfs) to access the host filesystem from the QEMU
guest side; /path/to/jailhouse is where you are going to compile Jailhouse
now. <tt  >cd</tt> to this directory and run:


<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone git@github.com:siemens/jailhouse.git jailhouse
cd jailhouse
make
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, switch to the guest and mount the 9p filesystem (for example, with
<tt  >mount -t 9p host /mnt</tt>). Then,
<tt  >cd</tt> to /mnt/jailhouse and execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo make firmware_install
sudo insmod jailhouse.ko
</pre>
</p><p>
This copies the Jailhouse binary image you've built to /lib/firmware and
inserts the Jailhouse driver module. Now you can enable Jailhouse with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse enable configs/qemu-vm.cell
</pre>
</p><p>
As the command returns, type <tt  >dmesg | tail</tt>. If you
see &ldquo;The Jailhouse
is opening.&rdquo; message, you've successfully launched the hypervisor,
and your Linux guest now runs under Jailhouse (which itself runs under
KVM/QEMU). If you get an error, it is an indication that your CPU is
missing
some required feature. If the guest hangs, this is most likely because
your host kernel or QEMU are not up to date enough for Jailhouse, or
something is wrong with qemu-vm cell config. Jailhouse sends all its
messages to the serial port, and QEMU simply prints them to the terminal
where it was started (Figure 2). Look at the messages to see what
resource (I/O port, memory and so on) caused the problem, and read on
for the details of Jailhouse configuration.

Configs and Inmates</h2></div></div><p>
Creating Jailhouse configuration files isn't straightforward. As
the code base must be kept small, most of the logic that takes place
automatically in other hypervisors must be done manually here (albeit with
some help from the tools that come with Jailhouse). Compared to libvirt or
VirtualBox XML, Jailhouse configuration files are very detailed and rather
low-level. The configuration currently is expressed in the form of plain C
files (found under configs/ in the sources) compiled into raw binaries;
however, another format (like DeviceTree) could be used in future versions.
</p><p>
Most of the time, you wouldn't need to create a cell config from scratch,
unless you authored a whole new inmate or want the hypervisor to run
on your specific hardware (see the Jailhouse for Real sidebar).
</p><p>
Cell configuration files contain information like hypervisor base address
(it should be within the area you reserved with
<tt  >memmap=</tt> earlier), a mask
of CPUs assigned to the cell (for root cells, it's 0xff or all CPUs
in the system), the list of memory regions and the permissions this
cell has to them, I/O ports bitmap (0 marks a port as cell-accessible)
and the list of PCI devices.
</p><p>
Each Jailhouse cell has its own config file, so you'll have one config
for the root cell describing the platform Jailhouse executes on (like
qemu-vm.c, as you saw above) and several others for each running cell. It's
possible for inmates to share one config file (and thus one cell),
but then only one of these inmates will be active at a given time.
</p><p>
In order to launch an inmate, you need to create its cell first:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell create configs/apic-demo.cell
</pre>
</p><p>
apic-demo.cell is the cell configuration file that comes with Jailhouse (I
also assume you still use the QEMU setup described earlier). This cell doesn't
use any PCI devices, but in more complex cases, it is recommended to
unload Linux drivers before moving devices to the cell with this command.
</p><p>
Now, the inmate image can be loaded into memory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell load apic-demo 
 &#8618;inmates/demos/x86/apic-demo.bin -a 0xf0000
</pre>
</p><p>
Jailhouse treats all inmates as opaque binaries, and although it
provides a small framework to develop them faster, the only thing it
needs to know about the inmate image is its base address. Jailhouse
expects an inmate entry point at 0xffff0 (which is different from
the x86 reset vector). apic-demo.bin is a standard demo inmate that comes
with Jailhouse, and the inmate's framework linker script ensures that if
the binary is mapped at 0xf0000, the entry point will be at the right
address. apic-demo is just a name; it can be almost anything
you want.
</p><p>
Finally, start the cell with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell start apic-demo
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, switch back to the terminal from which you run QEMU. You'll see that lines
like this are being sent to the serial port:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Calibrated APIC frequency: 1000008 kHz
Timer fired, jitter:  38400 ns, min:  38400 ns, max:  38400 ns
...
</pre>
</p><p>
apic-demo is purely a demonstrational inmate. It programs the APIC timer
(found on each contemporary CPU's core) to fire at 10Hz and measures
the actual time between the events happening. Jitter is the difference between
the expected and actual time (the latency), and the smaller it is, the
less visible (in terms of performance) the hypervisor is. Although this
test isn't quite comprehensive, it is important, as Jailhouse targets
real-time inmates and needs to be as lightweight as possible.
</p><p>
Jailhouse also provides some means for getting cell
statistics. At the most basic level, there is the sysfs interface under
/sys/devices/jailhouse. Several tools exist that pretty-print this
data. For instance, you can list cells currently on the system with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell list
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is shown in Figure 3. &ldquo;IMB-A180&rdquo; is the root cell's
name. Other cells also are listed, along with their current states and
CPUs assigned. The &ldquo;Failed CPUs&rdquo; column contains CPU cores that triggered
some fatal error (like accessing an unavailable port or unassigned memory
region) and were stopped.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11775f3.large.jpg"><img src="11775f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Jailhouse cell listing&mdash;the same information is available
through the sysfs interface.
</p></div></div><p>
For more detailed statistics, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell stat apic-demo
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll see something akin to Figure 4. The data is updated periodically (as
with the <tt  >top</tt> utility) and contains various low-level counters like the number of
hypercalls issued or I/O port accesses emulated. The lifetime total and
per-second values are given for each entry. It's mainly for developers,
but higher numbers mean the inmate causes hypervisor involvement more
often, thus degrading the performance. Ideally, these should be close
to zero, as jitter in apic-demo. To exit the tool, press Q.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11775f4.large.jpg"><img src="11775f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Jailhouse cell statistics give an insight into how cells
communicate with the hypervisor.

Tearing It Down</h2></div></div><p>
Jailhouse comes with several demo inmates, not only apic-demo. Let's
try something different. Stop the inmate with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell destroy apic-demo
JAILHOUSE_CELL_DESTROY: Operation not permitted
</pre>
</p><p>
What's the reason for this? Remember the apic-demo cell had
the &ldquo;running/locked&rdquo; state
in the cell list. Jailhouse introduces a locked state to prevent changes
to the configuration. A cell that locks the hypervisor is essentially
more important than the root one (think of it as doing some critical job at
a power plant while Linux is mostly for management purposes on that
system). Luckily, apic-demo is a toy inmate, and it unlocks Jailhouse after
the first shutdown attempt, so the second one should succeed. Execute
the above command one more time, and apic-demo should disappear from
the cell listing.
</p><p>
Now, create tiny-demo cell (which is originally for tiny-demo.bin, also
from the Jailhouse demo inmates set), and load 32-bit-demo.bin into it
the usual way:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse cell create configs/tiny-demo.cell
sudo tools/jailhouse cell load tiny-demo 
 &#8618;inmates/demos/x86/32-bit-demo.bin -a 0xf0000
sudo tools/jailhouse cell start tiny-demo
</pre>
</p><p>
Look at com2.txt in the host (the same directory you started QEMU
from). Not only does this show that cells can be re-used by the inmates
provided that they have compatible resource requirements, it also proves
that Jailhouse can run 32-bit inmates (the hypervisor itself and the
root cell always run in 64-bit mode).
</p><p>
When you are done with Jailhouse, you can disable it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse disable
</pre>
</p><p>
For this to succeed, there must be no cells in
&ldquo;running/locked&rdquo; state.
</p><p>
This is the end of our short trip to the Jailhouse. I hope you enjoyed your
stay. For now, Jailhouse is not a ready-to-consume product, so you may
not see an immediate use of it. However, it's actively developed and
somewhat unique to the Linux ecosystem, and if you have a need for real-time
application virtualization, it makes sense to keep a close eye on its
progress.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25fd580.0x26ee7e8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Jailhouse for Real</b></p><p>
QEMU is great for giving Jailhouse a try, but it's also possible to test
it on real hardware. However, you never should do this on your PC. With
a low-level tool like Jailhouse, you easily can hang your root cell where 
Linux runs, which may result in filesystem and data corruption.
</p><p>
Jailhouse comes with a helper tool to generate cell configs, but usually 
you still need to tweak the resultant file. The tool depends on Python;
if you don't have it on your testing board, Jailhouse lets you collect 
required data and generate the configuration on your main Linux PC
(it's safe):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo tools/jailhouse config collect data.tar
# Copy data.tar to your PC or notebook and untar
tools/jailhouse config create -r path/to/untarred/data 
 &#8618;configs/myboard.c
</pre>
</p><p>
The configuration tool reads many files under /proc and /sys (either collected 
or directly), analyzes them and generates memory regions, a PCI devices
list and other things required for Jailhouse to run.
</p><p>
Post-processing the generated config is mostly a trial-and-error 
process. You enable Jailhouse and try to do something. If the system
locks up, you analyze the serial output and decide if you need to grant
access. If you are trying to run Jailhouse on a memory-constrained
system (less than 1GB of RAM), be careful with the hypervisor memory area,
as the configuration tool currently can get it wrong. Don't forget to
reserve memory for Jailhouse via the kernel command line the same way
you did in QEMU. On some AMD-based systems, you may need to adjust
the Memory Mapped I/O (MMIO) regions, because Jailhouse doesn't support AMD
IOMMU technology yet, although the configuration tool implies it does.
</p><p>
To capture Jailhouse serial output, you'll likely need a serial-to-USB 
adapter and null modem cable. Many modern motherboards come with no 
COM ports, but they have headers you can connect a socket to (the cabling 
is shown in Figure a). Once you connect your board to the main Linux PC,
run minicom or similar to see the output (remember to set the port's baud rate
to 115200 in the program's settings).
