Until now we've been consenting to what Web sites and apps want, but soon
it'll also be the other way around.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a9580.0x16a1300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Whatever your opinions about Do Not Track, set them aside for a minute and
just look at what the words say and who says them. 
Individuals&mdash;the people we call &ldquo;users&rdquo; (you know, like with
drugs)&mdash;are the ones saying it. In grammatical terms, &ldquo;do not
track&rdquo; is
spoken in the first person. In legal terms, it's spoken by the first party.
The site is the second person and the second party. The unwanted tracking
is mostly by a third person <span   class="emphasis"><em>them</em></span>: third parties the first one doesn't want
following him or her around. In both the grammatical and the legal senses,
individuals want <span   class="emphasis"><em>consent</em></span> to the Do Not Track request. And mostly they
don't get it.
</p><p>
It's easy to lay the blame on lack of agreement about what Do Not Track
does, or should do, and how. But the real problem is deeper: in the power
asymmetry of client-server, which we might also call calf-cow (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11831f1.large.jpg"><img src="11831f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Client-Server or Calf-Cow
</p></div></div><p>
In client-server, we're calves and sites are cows. We go to sites to suckle
&ldquo;content&rdquo; and get lots of little unwanted files, most of which are meant to
train advertising crosshairs on us. Having Do Not Track in the world has
done nothing to change the power asymmetry of client-server. But it's not
the only tool, nor is it finished. In fact, the client-side revolution in
this space has barely started.
</p><p>
I am writing this to prepare for a talk I'll give (as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
editor) at the Workshop on Meaningful Consent in the Digital Economy 2015.
It's at the University of Southampton in the UK on February 26, which means
it will have happened by the time you read this. It will be interesting to
see how coverage differs from what I'm planning to say, and you're about to
read.
</p><p>
By &ldquo;meaningful consent&rdquo;, they mean &ldquo;issues related to giving and obtaining
user consent online, with special emphasis on privacy and data
protection&rdquo;.
I'm focusing on the giving side, because that's the frontier. Very few
commercial sites give consent to users of any meaningful kind&mdash;except,
perhaps, as legal butt-covering. (&ldquo;Here's our consent: go look at our
privacy policy.&rdquo;) And there are few ways for individuals to express the
desire for consent, especially around privacy. (Do Not Track is just one of
them.) Basically we travel the Web naked, unless we're wizards (such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers) who know how to secure their
on-line homes, wear the
right protective clothing and customize their own vehicles. But ways are
being developed for the muggles of the world, and I want to run a few of
those down. Here they are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Do Not Track.
</p></li><li><p>
Ad and tracking blockers.
</p></li><li><p>
Privacy icons.
</p></li><li><p>
UMA (User Managed Access).
</p></li><li><p>
IDESG's Internet Ecosystem Steering Group.
</p></li><li><p>
Open Notice and Consent Receipts.
</p></li><li><p>
Respect Trust Framework.
</p></li><li><p>
Customer Commons' user-submitted terms.
</p></li><li><p>
CommonAccord's Digital Law Commons.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>1. Do Not Track</b></span> is an HTTP header (DNT) that asks a site or an app to
disable unwanted tracking. There is disagreement about what kinds of
tracking should be disabled and how various things work. But all the
browser makers enable it (in different ways), so that's progress. And,
regardless of whatever becomes of DNT, the step is still in the right
direction, because it carries a signal of intent from the individual.
Consent comes back the other way&mdash;or should. (I first heard of DNT
from Chris Soghoian at a Berkman Center meeting in the late 2000s. Chris,
Sid Stamm and Dan Kaminsky are regarded as DNT's original authors. In
recent years, the W3C has carried the DNT ball, through many internal and
external disagreements&mdash;especially with the IAB and the DAA. (Chris
also published a detailed history of DNT in January 2011.)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>2. Ad and tracking blockers</b></span> selectively throttle tracking, advertising or
both. Here's a partial list of the ones I have installed on my own
browsers:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Adblock Plus: <a href="https://adblockplus.org" target="_self">https://adblockplus.org</a>.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
PrivownyBar: <a href="https://privowny.com" target="_self">https://privowny.com</a>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Each has advantages, none of which I'll visit here. As for consent, they
all fail to signal much if anything. Their main work is
prophylactic.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>3. Privacy icons</b></span> are visual signals.
Disconnect's can &ldquo;read and change all
your data on the websites you visit&rdquo;. They look like Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11831f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

An earlier effort is Aza Raskin's, which became Mozilla's. The following is a list
of what each
symbol says. (The images are gone from Aza's original post, but are
available at his Flickr site with a Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 Generic license. Since <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux

commercial, we'll leave seeing them up to you&mdash;see Resources.)
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div><p>
Those would be handy. Alas, the commercial Web site publishing business has
shown little interest in them and will continue so as long as all the
signaling is left up to them.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>4. UMA&mdash;User Managed Access</b></span> is the brainchild of Eve Maler (currently
an analyst with Forrester Research), and its home is the User Managed
Access WG (Working Group) at Kantara. UMA's charter is &ldquo;to develop specs
that let an individual control the authorization of data sharing and
service access made between online services on the individual's behalf, and
to facilitate interoperable implementations of the specs&rdquo;. It's an
OAuth-based protocol. Token movement through UMA currently looks like
Figure 3.

<span   class="bold"><b>5. IDESG's Identity Ecosystem Steering
Group</b></span> is part of NSTIC: the National
Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace, which was launched by the
White House in 2011 and is meant to create an implementation road map that
will reside within the Department of Commerce. The IDESG is working toward
&ldquo;secure, user-friendly ways to give individuals and organizations
confidence in their online interactions&rdquo;. Here's the wiki:
<a href="https://www.idecosystem.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_self">https://www.idecosystem.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>. And here is the
User Experience Committee:
<a href="https://www.idecosystem.org/group/user-experience-committee" target="_self">https://www.idecosystem.org/group/user-experience-committee</a>, which is taking the lead on this thing.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>6. Open Notice and Consent Receipts</b></span> is an
OpenNotice.org project, &ldquo;a
group of people and projects that are innovating to address the broken
notice and consent infrastructure to enable greater control of personal
data&rdquo;. Its main focus is on the consent receipt project. Work here lives
at the Consent &amp; Information Sharing Work Group (CISWG) at Kantara. The
purpose is to specify receipts of consent exchanged between first and
second parties. Everything else I can tell you about it is beyond
complicated. What matters is that it's being worked on by highly committed
people who not only grok it, but also are working to simplify it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>7. Respect Trust Framework</b></span> is one of five frameworks created by the Open
Identity Exchange. This one requires that parties to the framework promise
to &ldquo;respect each others' digital boundaries&rdquo;. This past year many
individuals, companies and development projects (me included) joined with
the Respect Network (&ldquo;the first global ecosystem for trusted personal
information exchange&rdquo;) to at least agree to the Framework. Respect Network
as a company ran out of runway, but it did succeed in getting the Framework
agreed to by a pile of parties, which is an accomplishment by itself. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>8. Customer Commons user-submitted terms</b></span> is intended to do for individual
terms what Creative Commons did for copyright licenses. Figure 4 shows one straw
man proposal, drawn originally on a whiteboard at VRM Day in October 2014.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11831f4.large.jpg"><img src="11831f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Customer Commons Straw Man Proposal from VRM Day in October 2014
</p></div></div><p>
It derives from EmanciTerms, by ProjectVRM, and which I described like this in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Intention Economy</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
With full agency...an individual can say, in the first-person voice,
&ldquo;I
own my data, I control who gets access to it, and I specify what I wish to
happen under what conditions.&rdquo; In the latter category, those wishes might
include:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Don't track my activities outside of this site.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't put cookies in my browser for anything other than helping us
remember each other and where we were.
</p></li><li><p>
Make data collected about me available in a standard, open format.
</p></li><li><p>
Please meet my fourth-party agent, Personal.com (or whomever).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These are EmanciTerms, and there will be corresponding ones on the vendor's
side. Once they are made simple and straightforward enough, they should
become normative to the point where they serve as <span   class="emphasis"><em>de
facto</em></span> standards, in
practice.
</p><p>
Since the terms should be agreeable and can be expressed in text that code
can parse, the process of arriving at agreements can be automated.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The mission of Customer Commons (a nonprofit spin-off of ProjectVRM), is
&ldquo;to restore the balance of power, respect and trust between individuals and
the organizations that serve them&rdquo;. Toward making that happen through
EmanciTerms, Customer Commons has engaged the Cyberlaw Clinic at the
Berkman Center and Harvard Law School, which &ldquo;provides high-quality,
pro-bono legal services to appropriate clients on issues relating to the
Internet, new technology, and intellectual property&rdquo;. It's still early in
that process, but the end result will be terms that you and I can assert,
and others will need to accept.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>9. CommonAccord's Digital Law Commons</b></span> is an end state when you have what
Jim Hazard and Primavera De Filippi call &ldquo;a way of rendering a document
from snippets of text organized as key-values in lists&mdash;a 'graph'.
It's applicable to a lot of knowledge management tasks, but especially
useful for codifying legal docs&rdquo;. In slightly more technical terms, the
Common Accord site explains, &ldquo;We have created a modular template system of
text cards that relies on {expansion} of strings and [expansion] of cards.
Period. People can program their relationships. Lawyers can codify
boilerplate. Management can have a data picture of the enterprise's
relationships, situation and activities. Smart contracts can be both
technical 'dry' code (i.e. self-contained code snippets) and legal 'wet'
code. With Common Accord, contract and legal text becomes cards of text,
interoperating, in git, shared, forked, tested and improved.&rdquo; Here it is on
Github: <a href="https://github.com/CommonAccord/Org/tree/master/Doc" target="_self">https://github.com/CommonAccord/Org/tree/master/Doc</a>.
</p><p>
I expect many of these efforts to merge, support each other and
cross-fertilize. There is a lot of convergence already.
</p><p>
Why should I be optimistic about results? Four reasons.
</p><p>
First is tech. Code is law, Professor Lessig taught us, and the code
required for asserting and agreeing to terms won't be terribly complicated.
</p><p>
Second is publicity. We&mdash;Customer Commons (on the board of which I
sit) and friends&mdash;will make a Big Thing out of the term, once we have
them, just like Creative Commons made a Big Thing out of its licenses when
those came out. Sites and services that don't listen to what users and
customers want will be exposed and shamed. Simple as that.
</p><p>
Third is pickup. It won't be hard for organizations like Consumer
Reports&mdash;as well as everybody in the lazyweb's long tail&mdash;to give
thumbs-up and thumbs-down to sites and services that agree to simple and
reasonable terms submitted by customers and users.
</p><p>
Fourth is performance. As I put it in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Intention
Economy</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Rather than guessing what might get the attention of consumers&mdash;or what
might &ldquo;drive&rdquo; them like cattle&mdash;vendors will respond to <span   class="emphasis"><em>actual
intentions of customers</em></span>. Once customers' expressions of intent become
abundant and clear, the range of economic interplay between supply and
demand will widen, and its sum will increase. The result we will call the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Intention Economy</em></span>.
</p><p>
This new economy will outperform the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Attention Economy</em></span> that has shaped
marketing and sales since the dawn of advertising. Customer intentions,
well expressed and understood, will improve marketing and sales, because
both will work with better information, and both will be spared the cost
and effort wasted on guesses about what customers might want, flooding
media with messages that miss their marks. Advertising will also improve.
</p><p>
The volume, variety, and relevance of information coming from customers in
the Intention Economy will strip the gears of systems built for controlling
customer behavior or for limiting customer input. The quality of that
information will also obsolete or repurpose the guesswork mills of
marketing, fed by crumb trails of data shed by customers' mobile gear and
Web browsers. &ldquo;Mining&rdquo; of customer data will still be useful to vendors,
though less so than intention-based data provided directly by customers.
</p><p>
In economic terms, there will be high opportunity costs for vendors that
ignore useful signaling coming from customers. There will also be high
opportunity gains for companies that take advantage of growing customer
independence and empowerment.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
But first we need the code. I expect we'll see enough to get started before
this year is out.
