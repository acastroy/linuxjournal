If you weren't scared away by my column last month, you must be
ready to flash your BIOS.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d83b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I introduced the Libreboot project: a
free software distribution of coreboot, which is itself an open-source BIOS
replacement. I also talked about some of the reasons you may want to
run a free software BIOS and discussed some of the associated risks. If you
made it through all of that and are ready to flash your BIOS, this article
will walk you through the process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d8568"></a>
Get Libreboot</h2></div></div><p>
Libreboot is available via binary distributions that make it easy to
install (which is what I cover below) as well as source code
distributions at <a href="http://libreboot.org/#releases" target="_self">libreboot.org/#releases</a>. To get the latest binary
release, go to <a href="http://libreboot.org/docs/release.html" target="_self">libreboot.org/docs/release.html</a>, and be sure to
download both the .xz as well as the corresponding .xv.sig file, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
http://libreboot.org/release/20150208/libreboot_bin.tar.xz
</p></li><li><p>
http://libreboot.org/release/20150208/libreboot_bin.tar.xz.sig
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you download the files, use <tt  >gpg --verify</tt> to validate that the
signature matches:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --verify libreboot_bin.tar.xz.sig libreboot_bin.tar.xz
gpg: Signature made Tue 14 Oct 2014 09:07:32 PM PDT using 
 &#8618;RSA key ID 656F212E
gpg: Good signature from "Libreboot Releases (signing key)
 &#8618;&lt;releases@libreboot.org&gt;"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs 
 &#8618;to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: C923 4BA3 200C F688 9CC0  764D 
 &#8618;6E97 D575 656F 212E
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that since I haven't added the Libreboot GPG key to my keyring and
trusted it, all it can do here is validate that the signature matches
whatever key generated the .sig, not that it's the official Libreboot key.
To do that, I would have to go to more effort to download and validate the
Libreboot GPG key.
</p><p>
Now that it has been validated, I can use <tt  >tar</tt> to
extract it and <tt  >cd</tt> to the
libreboot_bin directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xvf libreboot_bin.tar.xz
$ cd libreboot_bin
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d8bf0"></a>
Pull Down Software Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>
There are a number of different libraries and software that this binary
release needs on your system to work. Inside the libreboot_bin directory,
you will see a deps-trisquel and deps-parabola script to be run as root. If
you use a Debian-based distribution, run
<tt  >deps-trisquel</tt>, and if you use an
Arch Linux-based distribution, run <tt  >deps-parabola</tt>. For other distributions,
unfortunately, you will need to use those scripts as a guide for what sorts
of libraries and packages you will need to download. In my case, I was
running from a Debian-based distribution (inside Tails in fact), so I ran:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./deps-trisquel
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have the package dependencies, you need to build flashrom and
bucts on your system. Libreboot has provided two scripts to automate this
process as well, called builddeps-bucts and builddeps-flashrom, so the next
step is to run those:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./builddeps-flashrom
$ sudo ./builddeps-bucts
</pre>
</p><p>
This should create a ./flashrom/flashrom and a ./bucts/bucts binary that
subsequent scripts will use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d8f08"></a>
Choose Your ROM</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have all of the software downloaded or compiled, the next step is
to identify which ROM you want to use. To ease the process and help ensure
that you don't brick your laptop, you can choose from a number of
pre-copiled BIOS ROMs that Libreboot provides.
Under the ./bin/ directory
are a few different directories named after the different laptops Libreboot
currently supports:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls bin/
macbook21  t60  x60  x60t
</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, I'm flashing an x60, so I want to choose a ROM from that
directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls bin/x60
libreboot_frazerty_txtmode.rom
libreboot_frazerty_vesafb.rom
libreboot_itqwerty_txtmode.rom
libreboot_itqwerty_vesafb.rom
libreboot_svenska_txtmode.rom
libreboot_svenska_vesafb.rom
libreboot_ukdvorak_txtmode.rom
libreboot_ukdvorak_vesafb.rom
libreboot_ukqwerty_txtmode.rom
libreboot_ukqwerty_vesafb.rom
libreboot_usdvorak_txtmode.rom
libreboot_usdvorak_vesafb.rom
libreboot_usqwerty_txtmode.rom
libreboot_usqwerty_vesafb.rom
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, there are a number of different ROMs for different languages
and keyboard layouts, and within each category, there also are txtmode and
vesafb options depending on whether you want your BIOS to display a
graphical GRUB screen in VESA mode or just rely on text mode. In my case, I
selected bin/x60/libreboot_usqwerty_vesafb.rom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d91c8"></a>
Back up the Old BIOS</h2></div></div><p>
You still are not yet at the point where you risk bricking anything, but
you
are close, so it's time to back up the old BIOS, so you have a chance of
recovering this laptop in case something goes wrong. When I first tried to
flash an x60 with coreboot, the main challenge was due to the fact that the
laptop series had two different potential BIOS chipsets, and each required a
special patch to flashrom. This meant physically inspecting the motherboard
with a magnifying glass and reading the tiny print on the BIOS chip. The
Libreboot project has greatly simplified this by creating both flashing
tools ahead of time and realizing that one will work, and the other will
fail safely.
</p><p>
So to back up your BIOS, <tt  >cd</tt> to the flashrom directory and run two different
commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd flashrom
$ sudo ./flashrom_lenovobios_sst -p internal -r factory.bin
flashrom v0.9.7-unknown on Linux 3.16.0-4-586 (i686)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at 
 &#8618;http://www.flashrom.org

Calibrating delay loop... OK.
Found chipset "Intel ICH7M". Enabling flash write... WARNING: 
 &#8618;SPI Configuration Lockdown activated.
OK.
No EEPROM/flash device found.
Note: flashrom can never write if the flash chip isn't 
 &#8618;found automatically.

$ sudo ./flashrom_lenovobios_macronix -p internal -r factory.bin
flashrom v0.9.7-unknown on Linux 3.16.0-4-586 (i686)
flashrom is free software, get the source code at 
 &#8618;http://www.flashrom.org

Calibrating delay loop... OK.
Found chipset "Intel ICH7M". Enabling flash write... 
 &#8618;WARNING: SPI Configuration Lockdown activated.
OK.
Found Macronix flash chip "MX25L1605D/MX25L1608D/MX25L1673E" 
 &#8618;(2048 kB, SPI) mapped at physical address 0xffe00000.
Reading flash... done.
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, it turns out I had a Macronix BIOS chip, so the first script
failed and the second script worked. The important thing is that at the
end,
you should have a factory.bin file in this directory. <span   class="bold"><b>Back this file
up!</b></span> Because often the BIOS image has customizations that apply to
that particular laptop, and because I have a number of different BIOS
images I need to back up, I like to label my BIOSes based on the serial
number, such as x60-BIOS-LV-A4332.bin (not a real serial number).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d94e0"></a>
Perform the First Libreboot Flash</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warning: if you run any of the commands after this point in the column
incorrectly, you risk bricking your laptop!</em></span> If you aren't willing to take
that risk, do not proceed! If you decide to proceed, read each example
carefully and check all of your commands for correctness before you press
Enter.
</p><p>
The BIOS flashing process occurs in two stages. The first stage is easily
reversible (if you use a provided Libreboot ROM at least) and flips a
particular setting in your BIOS and changes part but not all of the BIOS
firmware. In the root directory where you unpacked the Libreboot tarball,
you will see two scripts: lenovobios_firstflash and lenovobios_secondflash.
Run the <tt  >lenovobios_firstflash</tt> command as root and pass it the path to the
Libreboot ROM you identified earlier.
</p><p>
Now, this command is going to output some incredibly frightening error
messages. This is because it's using a general-purpose flashrom tool that
in this first phase cannot completely reflash your BIOS. Instead, it is
going to set <tt  >BUC.TS=1</tt> (a flag that will let you completely rewrite the BIOS
after a complete shutdown) as well as set up a basic BIOS bootloader, but
otherwise will fail, as it doesn't yet have the ability to rewrite all of
the flash:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./lenovobios_firstflash bin/x60/libreboot_usqwerty_vesafb.rom
Don't panic. See docs/index.html for an explanation of what BUC.TS is.

 &#8618;That is normal, expected and very good. And you will

Now you will SHUT DOWN (ignore the flashrom warning) but 
 &#8618;first keep in mind before you then boot:

 &#8618;the normal menus don't work, or check docs/index.html 
 &#8618;or #libreboot on freenode.
SHUT DOWN NOW!!!! WAIT A FEW SECS!!!! THEN BOOT.
DON'T PANIC.
</pre>
</p><p>
With all of this output, there are a few specific things that you want to
see. The first is this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Current BUC.TS=0 - 128kb address range 0xFFFE0000-0xFFFFFFFF 
 &#8618;is untranslated
Updated BUC.TS=1 - 64kb address ranges at 0xFFFE0000 and 
 &#8618;0xFFFF0000 are swapped
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't see <tt  >Updated BUC.TS=1</tt>, don't reboot, but
instead, attempt to
run the command again. The second kind of output you want to look for is
something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Reading old flash chip contents... done.
Erasing and writing flash chip... spi_block_erase_20 failed 
 &#8618;during command execution at address 0x0

</pre>
</p><p>
Yes, that seems like a scary error, but it's apparently the kind of scary
error that you want to see. What's happening is that flashrom was able to
write part of the flash chip but not all of it, so it's erroring. If you see
some sort of radically different scary error from the above, don't
reboot or shut down your machine. Instead, use the flashrom tool to
re-install your original BIOS.
</p><p>
Otherwise, if you see similar output to mine, completely shut down your
machine, wait a few seconds, and then boot up again. You should see the
Libreboot boot screen with a GRUB menu presenting a few options. You can
attempt to use the normal menu options to boot from the local hard drive, or
if that fails, select Search for GRUB configuration on local storage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d9bc0"></a>
If First Flash Fails</h2></div></div><p>
If after the first flash you don't see anything when you power on, the
simplest explanation may be that your laptop backlight reset, so use the
Fn-Home key combination to increase the brightness. Otherwise, if you see no
boot screen, but the laptop itself doesn't make any sounds, you 
still can revert to the old BIOS. Just remove the keyboard and disconnect the
CMOS battery for five to ten seconds, then plug it back in. You should be
able to boot back in to your original BIOS. Otherwise, if you hear three
beeps when you power it on, the laptop unfortunately has been bricked, and
you will have to resort to a hardware flash to restore it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14e0580.0x15d9cc8"></a>
Perform the Second Libreboot Flash</h2></div></div><p>
Once you boot back in to your system on the new Libreboot BIOS, it's time to
perform the second flash. This flash will permanently replace the original
BIOS with Libreboot. Go back to your Libreboot binary directory, and run the
<tt  >lenovobios_secondflash</tt> utility as root with the same ROM you chose before
as an argument:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./lenovobios_secondflash bin/x60/

Don't panic. See docs/index.html for an explanation 
 &#8618;of what BUC.TS is.
MAKE SURE THAT YOU SEE 'VERIFIED' AT THE END (YOU WANT TO SEE

I don't know, there's something about seeing the words &ldquo;don't

that makes you want to panic. Okay, as you can see in this output, there
shouldn't be any scary errors. Instead, I was able to read the old flash

If you see output like this, congratulations, you have completely replaced
your BIOS with Libreboot! Now just shut down your machine, wait a few
seconds, and the next time you boot, there it will be, completely with free
software. Of course, you may decide you want to change the boot menu you
see with Libreboot. If so, be sure to check out my final article in this
series next month where I discuss how to tweak the initial GRUB boot menu.
