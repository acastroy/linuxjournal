Standard input, output and error are confusing&mdash;until now.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2536358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Punny title aside, the concepts of STDIN (standard input), STDOUT
(standard output) and STDERR (standard error) can be very confusing,
especially to folks new to Linux. Once you understand how data gets into
and out of applications, however, Linux allows you to string commands
together in awesome and powerful ways. In this article, I want to clear up
how things work, so you can make the command line work much more
efficiently.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2536510"></a>
Processes and Their Data</h2></div></div><p>
At a basic level, when a process is run on the command line, it has three
&ldquo;data ports&rdquo; where it can send and/or receive data. Figure 1 shows my
depiction of an application's I/O design.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11840f1.large.jpg"><img src="11840f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The most confusing aspect is that STDOUT and STDERR both print
to the console by default.
</p></div></div><p>Here are some definitions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
STDIN: this is where an application receives input. If you run a
program that asks you to enter your age, it receives that info via its
STDIN mechanism, using the keyboard as the input device.
</p></li><li><p>
STDOUT: this is where the results come out of the program. If you type
<tt  >ls</tt>, the file listings are sent to STDOUT, which by default displays
on the screen.
</p></li><li><p>
STDERR: if something goes wrong, this is the error message. It can be a
little confusing, because like STDOUT, STDERR is displayed on the screen
by default as well. If you type <tt  >ls mycooldoc</tt>, but there's no such
file as &ldquo;mycooldoc&rdquo;, you'll get an error message on the screen. Even
though it appears on the screen in the same place STDOUT appears, it's
important to understand that it came out of a different place. That's
important, because STDOUT and STDERR can be directed separately and to
different places.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It's also important to realize that I/O is different from command-line
arguments or flags. Input, for example, is data the process gets from some
external source. When you run a command with arguments, those arguments
just tell the process how to run. Typing <tt  >ls -l</tt>, for
instance, just tells
the ls program how to execute. The STDIN/OUT/ERR are used only once the
program is running as a way to send or receive data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2536cf8"></a>
STDIN Example</h2></div></div><p>
By default, STDIN is read from the keyboard. So, this little script prompts
for input via the keyboard. When you enter the information and press
enter, it's fed into the application's STDIN. Then that information is
processed, and the result is dumped out of STDOUT, which by default is
displayed on the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
echo "What is your favorite number?"
read favnum
echo "My favorite number is $favnum too!"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you look closely, the initial &ldquo;What's your favorite
number?&rdquo; text is
also sent out STDOUT, and since it defaults to the screen, you see it as
a prompt before the script uses the read command to get data into STDIN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2536f08"></a>
Redirecting STDOUT and STDERR</h2></div></div><p>
You've seen that STDOUT and STDERR both default to displaying on the
screen. It's often more desirable to have one or both get saved to a file
instead of displayed. To redirect the output, use the &ldquo;greater-than&rdquo;
symbol. For example, typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls &gt; results.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x25370c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will save the directory listing to a file called results.txt instead of
displaying it on the screen. That example, however, redirects only the
STDOUT, not the STDERR. So if something goes wrong, the error message
displays on the screen instead of getting saved to a file. So in this
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls filename &gt; results.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2537220"></a></h2></div></div><p>
if there is not file called &ldquo;filename&rdquo;, you'll see an error on the screen
even though you redirected STDOUT into a file. You'll see something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls filename &gt; results.txt
ls: cannot access filename: No such file or directory
</pre>
</p><p>
There is a way to redirect the STDERR, which is similar to redirecting
STDOUT, and without first understanding the difference between the two
output &ldquo;ports&rdquo;, it can be confusing. But to redirect STDERR instead of
STDOUT, you'd type this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls 2&gt; errors.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Which, when typed, simply would print the file listing on the
screen. Using the <tt  >2&gt;</tt> structure, you are only redirecting errors to the
file. So in this case:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls filename 2&gt; errors.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x25375e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
if there isn't a file named &ldquo;filename&rdquo;, the error message 
would get saved to the file errors.txt, and nothing would display on
the screen. It's possible to do both at once too. So you could type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls &gt; results.txt 2&gt; errors.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x25377a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you'd see the file listing in results.txt, while any error messages
would go into errors.txt. You've probably seen something similar in
crontab, where the desire is to have both STDOUT and STDERR go into a
file. Usually, the desire is to have them both get redirected into the
same file, so you'll see something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ls &gt; stuff.txt 2&gt;&amp;1

</pre>
</p><p>
That looks really confusing, but it's not as bad as it seems. The
first part should make sense. Redirecting STDOUT into a file called
stuff.txt is clear. The second part, however, is just redirecting STDERR
<span   class="emphasis"><em>into</em></span> STDOUT. The reason you can't just type
<tt  >2&gt;1</tt> is because Bash would
interpret that as &ldquo;I want to save the STDERR into a file named
1&rdquo;, so the ampersand preceding the 1 tells Bash you want to redirect the
STDERR into STDOUT.
</p><p>
One last trick regarding the redirection of STDOUT and STDIN is the
double greater-than symbol. When you redirect output into a file using
the &gt; symbol, it overwrites whatever is in the file. So if you have an
errors.txt file, it will overwrite what's already in there and just
show the single error. With a &gt;&gt; symbol, it will append the results
instead of overwriting. This is really useful if you're trying to make
a log file. For example, typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls &gt;&gt; files.txt
ls -l &gt;&gt; files.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2537b10"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will create a file called &ldquo;files.txt&rdquo; that has a list of the files,
then a long directory listing of the same files. Thankfully, if the
file doesn't exist, using a double greater-than symbol will create the
file just like a single greater-than symbol will do. As you can imagine,
redirecting output is very useful when running scripts or programs that
are executed in the background; otherwise, you'd never see the
output!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2537cc8"></a>
Redirecting STDIN</h2></div></div><p>
This concept is a little bit harder to understand, but once you
&ldquo;get&rdquo;
the whole concept of I/O, it's not too bad. It's important to know that
not all applications listen on their STDIN port, so for some programs,
redirecting STDIN does nothing. One common command that does listen on
STDIN, however, is grep. If you type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep chicken menu.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x29300d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the grep command will search through the menu.txt file for any lines
containing the string &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;, and print those lines on the
screen (via
STDOUT, which should make sense now). grep also will accept input via
STDIN instead of via filename, however, so you could do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat menu.txt | grep chicken
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930288"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the exact same results will be shown. If that seems confusing, just
walk through the process with me. When you type <tt  >cat
menu.txt</tt>, the cat
program displays the contents of menu.txt to the screen, via STDOUT. If
you used a &gt; symbol, you could redirect that STDOUT into a new file,
but if you use the pipe symbol (|), you can redirect the STDOUT data into
another program's STDIN. That's what's happening in this example. It's as
if the cat program's purple STDOUT tube in Figure 1 is bolted directly
onto grep's blue STDIN tube. Since grep is listening on its STDIN port
for data, it then executes its search for the word chicken on that data
that is coming into STDIN rather than reading from a file.
</p><p>
This example above might seem frivolous, and honestly it is. Where
redirecting with a pipe symbol comes in handy is when you string together
multiple actions. So this, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep chicken menu.txt | grep pasta
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930498"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will return a list of all of the lines in menu.txt that have the word
&ldquo;chicken&rdquo; in them <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> have the world
&ldquo;pasta&rdquo; in them. You could do the
same thing by typing this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep chicken menu.txt &gt; chickenlist.txt
grep pasta chickenlist.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
But, that takes two lines, and then you have a fairly useless file on your
system called chickenlist.txt, when all you wanted was a list of items
that contain both chicken and pasta.
</p><p>
Once you get used to piping STDOUT from one command into STDIN for
another, you'll find yourself becoming a grep ninja in no time.
Granted,
there are many other applications that listen on STDIN for information,
but grep is one that is very commonly used. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l /etc | grep apache
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930860"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is a way to look for any files or directories in the /etc folder that
contain the string &ldquo;apache&rdquo; in their name. Or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /var/log/syslog | grep USB
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930a18"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is a great way to look for any log entries in the syslog that mention
USB devices. You even could go further and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /var/log/syslog | grep USB &gt; usbresults.txt
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930b78"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you'd have a text file containing any lines in /var/log/syslog that
mention USB. Perhaps you're troubleshooting an issue, and you need to
send those lines to a tech support person.
</p><p>
Redirecting STDOUT and STDERR into a file, or piping them into another
process' STDIN, is an important concept to understand. It's important
to know the difference between what a &gt;, &gt;&gt; and | do so that
you get the results you want. Sometimes redirecting STDOUT, STDERR
and STDIN aren't enough, however, because not all applications listen
for data on STDIN. That's where xargs comes into play.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930cd8"></a>
xargs: Making Apps Play Nice</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes you want to use the STDOUT from one command to interact with
an application that doesn't support getting data piped into STDIN. In
this case, you can use the simple and powerful xargs command. Here's a
scenario: your hard drive is filling up, so you want to delete all
the .mp3 files in all the folders in the entire system. You can get a
list of all of those files by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name "*.mp3"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x243e580.0x2930e38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you'll get a list via STDOUT of all the files and their full paths. So
you might get something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/home/spowers/music/re_your_brains.mp3
/home/spowers/music/mysong.mp3
/tmp/coolsong.mp3
/home/donna/.secretfolder/bieber.mp3
/home/donna/.secretfolder/rundmc.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
You could go through and find all those files and delete them one by
one, but it would be far more useful if you could just
<tt  >rm</tt> them all
at once. Unfortunately, <tt  >rm</tt> doesn't accept file listings via STDIN, so
in order to accomplish this goal, you have to use xargs. It would work
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name "*.mp3" | xargs rm -rf
</pre>
</p><p>
What xargs does is listen on its STDIN, and then execute whatever command
you tell it to while pasting its own STDIN onto the end of the command. So
running that above command effectively is executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm -rf /home/spowers/music/re_your_brains.mp3 \
/home/spowers/music/mysong.mp3 /tmp/coolsong.mp3 \
/home/donna/.secretfolder/bieber.mp3 \
/home/donna/.secretfolder/rundmc.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
And since <tt  >rm</tt> will delete all the files you list, it deletes all the files
with a single command. Without xargs to feed the list of files from the
find command, it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to accomplish
the task.

STDs and Pipes: Thinking Tools</h2></div></div><p>
For some people, the concepts of STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are second
nature. But without that foundational understanding of how processes do
I/O, redirection and piping are pretty much incomprehensible. Also, once
you truly understand how it all works, the xargs program really starts
to shine. I urge you to play around with redirection and piping. At the
very least, your grep kung-fu will benefit from the practice!
