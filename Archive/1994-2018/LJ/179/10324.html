When your panel is littered with application shortcuts or you
press Alt-F2 every few minutes to launch a new program, check out a better,
faster way to launch your programs&mdash;GNOME Do.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21ef300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There are many different ways to launch applications on a Linux
system. For the longest time, I would alternate between the menu system
that came with my window manager and typing the application in a
terminal. Honestly, I found that half the time it was faster to launch an
application inside a terminal than it was to navigate through a system
of menus. At some point in my desktop use, I decided to give the default
Ubuntu GNOME desktop a try. GNOME presents at least four main ways to
launch applications:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Navigate the Applications menu at the top of the screen and find
your program.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy frequently launched applications to the desktop and launch them from
the desktop.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy frequently launched applications to the panel and launch them from
the panel.
</p></li><li><p>
Press Alt-F2 to bring up a command window where you can type the command
and press Enter.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I tried each of the four main ways, but I guess I'm a creature of habit,
because ultimately, I found myself back to my old ways. When I wanted to
launch a program, nine times out of ten, I just would go to an open terminal
and type in the command from there. Every now and then, I would navigate
the Applications menu. That was my habit, until I discovered
GNOME Do. Now I've found I use GNOME Do when I launch the majority of my
applications and use a keyboard shortcut, or occasionally, the terminal, for
the rest. I don't really even need or use the Applications menu anymore.

Welcome to GNOME Do</h2></div></div><p>
GNOME Do is an application launcher tool inspired by the Quicksilver
and GNOME Launch Box applications. It is available either as a package
in your distribution or you can download the program from the official
project page (<a href="http://do.davebsd.com" target="_self">do.davebsd.com</a>). You launch GNOME Do in the background along with your
desktop environment, and then press Super-Space to open the GNOME Do window
when you want to launch an application (Super is the Windows key on
many keyboards). After the window appears, type part of the name for an
application; for instance, to open Firefox, type
<tt  >firefox</tt>. You will
notice that the moment you press the F key, GNOME Do chooses an application
or other result and refines it as you type. You might need to type
only <tt  >fi</tt> for Firefox to be displayed (Figure 1). In
most cases, there also
are alternate choices for your keyword, which you can reveal and select with
the up and down arrows (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10324f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
GNOME Do is a learning program, and as you use it, you will notice that
it selects results based on your favorite, most-used choices. This means if you
launch F-Spot more often than Firefox, F-Spot shows up first when
you press F. GNOME Do also learns which actions (the items that show
up in the right pane) you have performed on particular objects and gives
those precedence. The ultimate goal is to make it fast and simple to
launch applications, open files and interact with different parts of
your computer via GNOME Do plugins (more on plugins later in this article).
</p><p>
While the left pane in the GNOME Do window lists objects, the right pane
lists actions. An ordinary action for a program like Firefox might be Run,
but if you press Tab you will highlight the right pane. Then, you can use the
up and down arrow keys to cycle through alternate actions. These actions
vary depending on the object, so for an application like Firefox,
you might get only the option to copy your typed text to the clipboard
or assign an alias. Different objects get a more complete list
of actions, so for instance, if the Files and Folders plugin is enabled,
it indexes the files in a list of directories. If I start to type
a particular filename, it locates matching files. I then can press
Tab, and when I press the down arrow key, I will see a number of actions, as shown in
Figure 3. In this example, I have the option to open the file, reveal the
file in the file manager, move the file to the trash, rename the file
or perform a number of other file operations. 
</p><p>
Figure 3 also shows that
depending on the option you choose, GNOME Do might open a third pane on
the right with more options. This often is used when you want to copy
or move a file so you can choose its new location.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10324f3.large.jpg"><img src="10324f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Preferences</h2></div></div><p>
GNOME Do has a pretty shallow learning curve. The interface is easy to
grasp, so before too long, you will find it easy to launch programs
and interact with plugins and other features. Of course, to get to
these features, you first need to go the Preferences window. In the top
right-hand corner of the window, you will notice a small triangle. When
you click on it, you'll see a drop-down menu with About, Preferences
and Quit options. Choose Preferences.
</p><p>
The Preferences window is minimalist (Figure 4) and divides its settings
into three tabs. In the first tab, you can change basic settings, such as
whether GNOME Do starts at login, whether to show its notification
icon and what theme to use. The second tab lets you configure keyboard
bindings used with GNOME Do in case you want to change the defaults. The
final Plugins tab is probably the most interesting. GNOME Do ships with
a number of plugins, and additional third-party plugins
extend GNOME Do's functionality.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10324f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
GNOME Do's plugins are what move this program beyond a replacement
for the Applications menu on your desktop into a blend between
a launcher, desktop search tool and central interface for other
desktop operations. Most of the plugins probably will be disabled by
default, so to get this extra functionality, you need to go into the
Preferences window and enable the particular plugin. Below, I highlight a
few particularly interesting plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21f0538"></a>
File Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
A few different plugins turn GNOME Do into a file browser
and search tool. The Files and Folders plugin indexes directories of
your choice (highlight the Files and Folders plugin in your Preferences
window, and then click Configure to set which folders it indexes). As
you type, GNOME Do lists files it finds within those directories
as results. You then can copy, delete, browse and perform a number of
other options on the files, as shown in Figure 3.
</p><p>
In addition to the Files and Folders plugin is the Locate Files
plugin. This plugin uses the GNU locate command, so instead of just
searching through directories you specify, you can type a keyword and then
select Locate Files in the actions pane. GNOME Do then returns the
list of results so you can act on them (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10324f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Locate Plugin Results
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21f0850"></a>
GNOME Tools</h2></div></div><p>
With a name like GNOME Do, you probably won't be surprised to know
that there are a number of plugins that extend into GNOME functions. The
GNOME Dictionary plugin provides a define action, so you can type a word,
choose define and get back a definition. The GNOME Screenshot plugin
adds a Take Screenshot result if you start to type that phrase. Then you
can configure screenshots of the entire desktop, a specific window
or even take screenshots after a timed delay. I used that particular
plugin quite a bit while writing this article.
</p><p>
The GNOME Terminal plugin extends the traditional Alt-F2 command window
in that you can not only run commands within the GNOME Terminal, you also can
select particular GNOME Terminal profiles you have created. Figure 6
shows the result when I type <tt  >mutt</tt> into GNOME Do. The Open Profile action
represents my mutt GNOME Terminal profile. 
</p><p>
Finally, the GNOME Session
Management plugin gives you the same functionality as the power button
at the top of the GNOME panel, so you can lock your screen, shut down,
reboot and hibernate your desktop.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10324f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x21f0c18"></a>
Google Tools</h2></div></div><p>
A number of plugins can query Google services. The Gmail
Contacts plugin indexes your Gmail contact list and provides it as results
to queries so you then can select actions, such as e-mail. You also
can interface with your Google Calendar using the plugin of the same name and
search through and even create new events. The Google Calculator plugin
lets you perform the same calculations and conversions you can perform
on the Google Calculator site, only within GNOME Do. Finally, with the
Google Maps plugin, you can type in an address and select Map to submit
the location to Google Maps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20f7580.0x25e8fc8"></a>
Other Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
GNOME Do includes so many great plugins, it's difficult to choose which
ones to list. Some other useful plugins allow you to index all of your
Firefox bookmarks or Evolution contacts, upload photos to Flickr or
ImageShack, update your Twitter status, search through your Rhythmbox
music collection, index Tomboy notes and even connect to remote hosts
over SSH. And, that's just the list of official plugins. 
GNOME Do also has many third-party
plugins that extend its
functionality even further.
</p><p>
I have to say that after trying all sorts of different methods to launch
applications, GNOME Do has won me over. If I'm already in a terminal, I
still sometimes will launch an application there, but I've switched to
GNOME Do to launch most of my programs and even use it as a replacement for
a file browser when I want to open a file quickly. If you find that
you have a number of key bindings set up to launch programs for you,
or if you are tired of reaching for the mouse every time you want to
run a program or open a file, I recommend giving GNOME Do a try.
