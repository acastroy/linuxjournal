<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span>&mdash;Fast-Paced Cartoon Combat
(<a href="http://www.warsow.net" target="_self">www.warsow.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
In the multitude of first-person shooter projects available comes a
particularly solid one: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> is based on the Qfusion 3-D engine
(itself a modification of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 2</em></span> GPL engine);
however, it runs as a
completely standalone package and has a solid feel, avoiding the tackier
drawbacks of a simple mod. For those of you about to say, &ldquo;I've seen
it all before&rdquo;, hold on, because this is a particularly solid outing
with some fresh approaches to game dynamics in an already-stale genre.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10355f1.large.jpg"><img src="10355f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> has two elements in particular that make it stand out from the
rest: speed and motion. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> is all about
how you move around in the 3-D
world. It's about fluidity, motion and some interesting changes to game
balance. Particularly interesting are moves, such as the &ldquo;Wall Jump&rdquo;, where pressing
a special key when touching a wall allows you to rebound while jumping,
or probably the game's main dynamic, &ldquo;Bunny Hopping&rdquo;. Bunny Hopping has
been in first-person games since you could first jump, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> adds
the element of increased momentum and speed, allowing for a slew of new
gameplay tactics and design elements.
</p><p>
Don't be put off by seeing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 2</em></span> either, Qfusion is not an old
and ugly engine destined to turn out some clunky old game that looks
blockier than a LEGO factory with clumsy control.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> is an elegant
title including great architecture, gameplay and feel, with its own unique cards
brought to the table. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> has a unique approach to weapons with two
types of ammo: the stock ammo that comes with a weapon (weaker) and
stronger ammo once more is collected. Aesthetics also play a large part,
in particular, a cell shading look similar to manga and the like,
lending the game a feel of something like a cross between <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
III</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nerf Arena Blast</em></span>. Part of this cell shading ideal is to remove the
ultra-realistic, gritty feel of most modern shooters and to reduce the
violent content and feel with something more lighthearted with a comic
inspiration (which is, indeed, a welcome relief).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10355f2.large.jpg"><img src="10355f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Despite the old <span  class="emphasis"><em>Quake 2</em></span> base, Qfusion's modifications allow for some
great architecture, as seen in <span  class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span>.

Cell shading makes <span  class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span>'s environment much more
colorful and lighthearted than today's standard grizzly fare of action games.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> is very easy. Available on the Web site is a unified
package containing both Windows and Linux binaries. Download this, and
extract it to somewhere convenient. Open the new folder either with a
file manager or a terminal if you're the minimalist type. The solitary
inconvenience in this package is that you'll have to flag two files as
executable: the warsow script and the platform binary that suits your
system. For Linux users with an Intel-based machine, you have the choice
of warsow.i386 or warsow.x86_64, for 32- and 64-bit systems, respectively.
</p><p>
If you're using a file manager (I use Konqueror for this example,
other file managers should be similar), right-clicking on the script
and the binary, and choosing Properties and then the Permissions tab
will show you the options you need. Check the box for Is executable,
and you should be ready to go simply by left-clicking on the warsow script
when you're done. For those using a terminal, this should do the trick:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u+x warsow warsow.i386
</pre>
</p><p>
Once done, start the game by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ warsow
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
First things first, I'm afraid that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> is a
multiplayer-only
affair&mdash;sorry. However, for those looking to refine their skills without
other humans, in-game bots are available (see the game's documentation
for more details). Before you jump head on into the action, check
out the available tutorials. These are clever presentations using the
game itself, but instead of you being in control, it puts the movement
&ldquo;on
rails&rdquo; so to speak, and a voice-over guides you through what is happening.
</p><p>
Once you're confident enough to start the game itself, the controls
are the standard FPS affair with WADS controlling the movement, and the Spacebar
for jumping, steering and looking around. Shooting is done with
the mouse, as well as with the &ldquo;Special&rdquo; button, which is used for dashing,
wall jumping and the like. All of the controls are re-assignable, however,
and it's well worth customizing it to your own needs as well as checking
out the game's other controls.
</p><p>
When you're ready, choose join game to search for an arena to play
in, or alternatively, you can host one yourself. At first, join game
probably will come up with nothing, so you will have to click search
down at the bottom to browse for new games. Choose the server that sounds
best for you (look for one with other players if you can, obviously),
and if you don't have the map installed, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> will download it from
that game's server.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> is at 0.40 status, yet the gameplay
is seriously solid. There are a few problems here and there, such as
the occasional menu quirk and jolts with the sound, but the level of
problems in the game are normally what you'd associate with something
close to full release instead of an early demonstration. I imagine that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warsow</em></span> probably will add things like single-player skirmishes before it
gets to something like 0.9 status, but it's already a fantastic piece
of work even for the fussiest of players. Keep an eye on this one,
and any programming houses, keep an eye on these coders!

libdmtx&mdash;Data Matrix Barcode Scanning
(<a href="http://www.libdmtx.org" target="_self">www.libdmtx.org</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I realise I tend to cover wacky things like molecule imaging,
telekinesis and 3-D knitting software, but this is something that
actually may be of genuine industrial use in everyday life. libdmtx
is an open-source project dedicated to providing tools for reading
and writing 2-D Data Matrix barcodes. The Data Matrix standard
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix</a>) is gaining widespread
popularity due to its impressive features, but it may be of particular
interest to the FOSS community because it's unencumbered by patents and
royalty-free (thus, free to use and distribute). Also, the existing
proprietary solutions can be quite expensive, and libdmtx now
has reached a point where it realistically can save some users six-digit
savings every year.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10355f4.large.jpg"><img src="10355f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Data Matrix barcodes also can hold secret messages along with the usual
barcode data as shown here.
</p></div></div><p>
Data Matrix barcodes have been around since the 1980s, but for years,
they were used only to mark electronic components. More recently, they
have been adopted by a wide variety of industries in the US and Europe,
and they are becoming especially popular with mobile phone developers due to
their affinity to work with small digital cameras. Most US readers 
instantly will recognize Data Matrix barcodes, as they appear on most
first-class mail delivered by the US Postal Service. Curious readers can snap
a photo of their mail with a camera or Webcam and scan it with libdmtx
without purchasing any special hardware (it also works well with faxed
and scanned images).

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10355f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10355f6.large.jpg"><img src="10355f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10355f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
libdmtx has the ability to find and decrypt barcodes under a variety
of trying conditions.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing libdmtx is fairly straightforward with either a Debian package
available under the name of libdmtx-utils or a source tarball. For those
installing via source, compiling is basically the standard affair of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdad580.0x129f498"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
However, the configure script did come up with a dependency you probably
won't have installed by default, GraphicsMagick. GraphicsMagick is in
many distro repositories though, and to get past the configure script,
I had to install libgraphicsmagick1 and libgraphicsmagick1-dev from the
Ubuntu archive.
</p><p>
Once you have libdmtx compiled, before you can run the program, you 
probably will need to run the following command (as root or sudo):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ldconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
I cover only very basic usage in reading barcodes for now, but
libdmtx also will write barcodes along with a bunch of other features
that make it worth checking the man pages. First, grab an
image to test. If you have a photo of a barcode around, great stuff,
use that. Otherwise, some test images are available from the source
tarball under the folder test/images_opengl, which cover a variety
of different situations and tricky tests on libdmtx's abilities. Once
you're ready to go, use the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dmtxread nameofimage.png
</pre>
</p><p>
And, that's pretty much all you need to do. dmtxread will spend a few
seconds analyzing the image you've given it, and if it finds a matrix
barcode, it then outputs the contained text to the terminal. Check
the screenshot for some of the hidden messages and real-world codes that
you can contain within a barcode.
</p><p>
What really intrigued me about this project is that you can recover
barcode data from old pictures that never would have been meant for the
purpose originally. And, the James Bond in me gets a kick out
of knowing you can hide a message in a barcode in a seemingly unrelated
picture as a covert method of communication&mdash;neat! Although this has just
a command-line utility for now, it's really only a basic program on top
of a very clever and versatile library. This project is begging for
a GUI front end, at which point, it could make some serious inroads and
savings in the real industrial world.

whohas&mdash;Package Finder
(<a href="http://www.philippwesche.org/200811/whohas/intro.html" target="_self">www.philippwesche.org/200811/whohas/intro.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, we have a tool that will end some serious headaches, whohas. According to the project's readme file:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
whohas is a command-line tool that allows querying several package
lists at once&mdash;currently supported are Arch, Debian, Gentoo and
Slackware. whohas is written in Perl and was designed to help package
maintainers find ebuilds, pkgbuilds and similar package definitions from
other distributions to learn from. However, it also can be used by normal
users who want to know: what distribution has packages available for
apps upon which the user depends and what version of a given package
is in use in each distribution or in each release of a distribution
(implemented only for Debian).
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10355f8.large.jpg"><img src="10355f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
whohas makes finding obscure packages a breeze.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
whohas is genuinely very easy to install and is unlikely to have
unresolved dependencies on most systems. Compilation isn't a worry either,
as whohas is merely a Perl script that gets copied into your /usr/bin
directory. To install whohas, grab the latest tarball from the whohas
Web site, extract the contents, and open a terminal in the new folder.
Then,
as root or sudo, enter the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./install.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once whohas is installed, using the program is as easy as entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ whohas nameofpackage
</pre>
</p><p>
You needn't be super-specific either. A simple search like
&ldquo;quake&rdquo;,
&ldquo;audacity&rdquo; or &ldquo;chartr&rdquo; will do fine&mdash;no need for entering something like
&ldquo;chartr_0.16_i386.deb&rdquo;. whohas then scans a number of repositories
and prints the results out to screen one by one. If nothing
comes up at first, don't despair; it still might be searching. whohas
also provides URLs to more details about the package, so project maintainer
Philipp Wesche recommends using a terminal that recognises hyperlinks
and allows easy forwarding to the browser. And, as with most *nix command-line programs of this nature, the results can be piped through to grep
and the like for further refinement (and if you know what that means,
you don't need me to explain how it works).
</p><p>
I'm hoping whohas will become an everyday tool the way we use something
like whereis or grep. whohas is a fantastic little project that should
have existed years ago, and hopefully, it will make its way into many
distributions by default.
