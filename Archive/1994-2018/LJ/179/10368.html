Mana Takahashi and Shoko Azuma's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Manga Guide to
Databases</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Learning databases can be fun? Such is the premise of Mana Takahashi
and Shoko Azuma's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Manga Guide to Databases</em></span>, published by No
Starch Press. The book uniquely fuses Japanese-style comics with serious
educational content on databases. It tells the story of Princess Ruruna's
challenges in managing the Kingdom of Kod's humongous fruit-selling
empire. Tico the fairy teaches the princess how to simplify her data
management, and together they design a relational database. They cover
concepts such as the the entity-relationship model, basic database
operations, SQL statements, database tuning, security, concurrency
and replication. Other features include examples and exercises (with
answer keys) and an appendix of frequently used SQL statements.

Round Solutions' AarLogic C10/3</h2></div></div><p>
Hot off the assembly line at Round Solutions is the new AarLogic C10/3,
a diminutive Linux-based breadboard covering a mere 104mm x 63mm of
real estate. The board sports quadband GPRS and SiRF3 GPS modules;
interfaces for USB, RS-232 and Ethernet; SD-card reader; 4MB of RAM
and dual ARM processors. The processor module is responsible for GSM
functionality and for applications executable under embedded Linux.
Connectivity options via the board's 192-pin socket include not only
keyboards, digital cameras and reading devices but also WLAN, Bluetooth
and GPS components. Round Solutions adds that the AarLogic C10/3 can be
easily coupled with a camera or environmental sensors. Ideal applications

Opengear's EMD 5000</h2></div></div><p>
From the &ldquo;ounce of prevention&rdquo; department comes Opengear's EMD 5000,
a new environmental management solution for continuous monitoring of
environmental conditions at the rack level. The EMD 5000 protects
critical data-center assets from hazards, such as heat, humidity, smoke,
water leaks, cabinet intrusion and other environmental conditions, by
providing facilities managers with extensive logging and alert facilities.
Users can view ambient temperature and humidity of the remote environment
and set the device to send progressive alarms automatically from
warning levels to critical alerts. The EMD also monitors the status of
two external dry contacts that can be connected to a smoke detector,
water detector, vibration or open-door sensor.

IBM, Virtual Bridges and Canonical's Virtual Desktop Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The trio
of IBM, Virtual Bridges and Canonical have joined forces to offer a
Linux-based virtual PC solution that the firms claim halves the costs of
licensing and maintaining a desktop. The solution hosts multiple virtual
Linux desktops on a server, replacing Microsoft Windows with Ubuntu Linux
and Microsoft Office with open-standards-based alternatives, such as IBM
Lotus Symphony. The virtual desktop, called Virtual Enterprise Remote
Desktop Environment (VERDE), is provided by Virtual Bridges. IBM cites
reduced TOC related to licensing, hardware upgrades, power consumption
and support requirements. The solution is a key component in IBM's
offerings for entities in financial services and in the public sector.
