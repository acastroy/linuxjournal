     While Linux shows some promise for handhelds, displacing current leaders Palm OS and Windows CE will be challenging.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4163f2.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13b3580.0x14ab558"></a></h2></div></div><p> Samsung subsidiary Gmate has announced
Yopy, the first handheld computer that runs Linux. Gmate hopes that
its support for Linux will lead to a flood of third-party software
for Yopy, rivaling the software infrastructure that has emerged for
Palm's handheld devices. While Linux shows some promise for
handhelds, displacing current leaders Palm OS and Windows CE will
be challenging. The prize is a market that will ship more than 10
million units this year and is growing by more than 30% per year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13b3580.0x14ab660"></a>A Powerful Handheld Computer</h2></div></div><p>Yopy is a true handheld device, measuring just over 5 inches
by 3 inches and weighing just under eight ounces. It bears a
striking resemblance to the latest crop of Windows CE devices known
as Pocket PCs, particularly to Compaq's iPaq H3600 device.</p><p>Yopy is nearly the same size as the H3600, although it is 25%
thicker and 25% heavier. Both devices include a color TFT display
and have a similar array of buttons. Inside, both rely on a 206MHz
StrongArm CPU with 32MB of battery-backed DRAM for storing user
data. These similarities are probably not coincidental&mdash;both
devices appear to be based on the same Intel reference
design.</p><p>32MB of flash ROM are required by Yopy to store its Mobile
Linux operating system and the core set of applications. The Pocket
PC version of Windows CE is apparently lighter, as the H3600
requires only 16MB. The extra flash ROM adds $30 to Yopy's
manufacturing cost, more than offsetting the $10-$20 license fee
for Windows CE. (Mobile Linux is free, of course.) Yopy takes
advantage of its relatively speedy CPU to offer a range of media
functions such as voice recording, MP3 playback, video playback and
games. It also includes a personal information manager (calendar,
address book, etc.), e-mail, a web browser and other utilities. To
take full advantage of the browser, users must add a modem using
the Compact Flash expansion slot.</p><p>The H3600 and other Pocket PCs offer all of these features as
well and, like Yopy, sell for about $500. Thus, any advantage for
Yopy must come from Linux itself, either in ease of use or
application availability. We were not able to test a Yopy unit, so
we can't comment on its usability, an area where Pocket PC has
gotten lukewarm reviews. When comparing application availability,
one must remember that standard Linux and Windows applications must
be modified to fit on a 240 x 320-pixel display. Microsoft has
already modified key programs such as Word, Excel and Outlook; over
time, the Linux community will develop a variety of applications
for Yopy.</p><p>Yopy offers nearly 100 times more CPU performance than the
popular Palm devices and 16 times more data memory than the Palm V.
The Palm products use a smaller, lower-resolution display that,
except for the new Palm IIIc, can't display colors. But the Palm V
is smaller, half as thick and less than half the weight of Yopy.
The Palm III and Palm V are also less than half the price.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13b3580.0x14ab8c8"></a>Can Linux Win?</h2></div></div><p>Most handheld computers sold today are from Palm or
Handspring, a Palm-compatible vendor. These devices have gained
popularity due to their relatively low cost and, more important,
their ease of use. Over the past four years, independent
programmers have developed thousands of Palm applications, many of
which are freely distributed.</p><p>Yet Palm remains vulnerable. The only new features that Palm
has added to its units since their 1996 debut are wireless
connectivity and a color screen, and these features are currently
available only in expensive, unpopular models. A true
second-generation handheld could generate many new sales and tip
the market away from Palm.</p><p>Linux and Windows CE already deliver next-generation features
such as multimedia capability and expandability, and they are good
platforms for adding voice recognition and wireless Internet
access. Linux has the advantage of being freely available,
including source code. Its larger footprint adds cost but, as the
price of flash memory falls, this penalty will be reduced.
Additional work on the code base could also bring Linux's code size
in line with that of Windows CE.</p><p>Although Gmate
<a href="http://www.gmate.co.kr" target="_self">www.gmate.co.kr</a>
is the first to deliver a Linux-based handheld, other vendors, both
large and small, are investigating this opportunity to eliminate a
Microsoft license fee. Therefore, more Yopy-like products are
likely to appear. If the Linux community can rally around these
tiny computers to develop an easy-to-use operating system and key
applications, Linux could flourish in the palm of your hand.</p></div></div>
