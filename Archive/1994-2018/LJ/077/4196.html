<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_self">http://www.google.com/</a>,
is the hottest search engine being used on the Internet today (see
Doc Searls' &ldquo;Google Gains...&rdquo;article, page 10). It's fast and
consistently returns relevant links. The company was founded in
1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The two collaborated on a new
search engine technology called PageRank&trade;. Since then, Google
has gathered quite a following&mdash;Yahoo! recently hired Google to
power its search engine&mdash;and now boasts the ability to link to over
1 billion URLs. I talked briefly with Sergey Brin, Google's
co-founder and President.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: What led to Google's
decision to use Linux? When did that start?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: Well, Larry Page and
I were in the Stanford PhD program in Computer Science. And we
developed Google there. The way the computer science program worked
is there was a hodgepodge of computer equipment lying around, and
we would grab whatever scraps we could. We had all kinds of
computers: HPs, Suns, Alphas and Intel's running Linux. So, we
gained a lot of experience with all of those platforms.</p><p>When we started Google, we had to make the decision of what
we wanted to use. Of course we chose Linux, because it is the most
cost effective solution.</p><p>PCs are not only much cheaper these days, but we can also get
them very quickly, because they're such a commodity item. That's an
incredible benefit. We just installed another 1,000 computers and
we got that done in a few weeks. That's really hard to do with any
other kind of workstation. I think that's an advantage that people
don't entirely realize.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Did you view it as
being better, or was cost the main reason?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: It was better in
some ways. Certainly for our purposes, we felt the support was
better. For example, the actual kernel authors will respond to
problems pretty quickly. They are especially responsive to Google
nowadays, since we're so widely used. We can have a 15 minute
turnaround. You can't really beat that for support.</p><p>That was an important factor, but frankly, the cost was a
bigger issue. PCs are so cheap, which is very important. Sun's
Solaris is probably more stable than Linux on PCs. It's hard to
determine the blame, whether it's the hardware or the operating
system. But, it's a minor difference.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Then, does all of
your support come from newsgroups or do you actually pay for it
through Red Hat?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: We have an
operations team of about ten people, which helps a lot. And other
than that we check newsgroups and e-mail the authors of the code.
Usually, if it's a problem we can't figure out, we go straight to
the authors.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Is Linux used on
desktops at Google?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: It depends.
Engineering mostly runs Linux. Business development/marketing runs
Windows. Actually, I use Linux with VMWare running Windows. Some
people have two computers, particularly some people in engineering
who do UI development and need to test things out on Windows
platforms. I find it better to just use VmWare and have one
computer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: In a technical sense,
what does Linux lack? What does it not provide?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: The 64-bit file
system, which I know they are working on. It's slowly coming
around. I think there are still occasionally some stability issues.
I'm not saying Linux is unique in that respect, but you definitely
want to have reliability. There are some issues dealing with higher
memory systems. If you get to 2GB, and you try to push it past
that, we encounter various problems. I know we've had some trouble
with the network stack when we really push it hard. In terms of
having lost most connections from lots of different
machines.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Well, you're getting
quite a few hits per day, aren't you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: Yes, we are. We do
about ten millions searches per day at Google.com. And another six
million or so from OEM customers. So, we get a lot of hits. And
when we crawl the Web, we crawl it pretty quickly, which can really
stress the system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Has your system been
down entirely?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: No, but we certainly
have individual computers go down. Our system has a lot of
redundancy built into it, so the users don't see it from the
outside.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: I've read that you
have developed your own network installation tools ...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: Yeah. We've re-used
various components of things that people have built; we've had to
now re-do them quite a bit ourselves. We have 5,000 computers now,
and that's actually a fair amount of work to install. So we have
our own network install system&mdash;where we can bring up 80 computers
at a time. And we have our own testing software and monitoring
tools to keep track of what the computers are doing, what state
they're in. So, we've had to do a fair amount of
development.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Of the 5,000
computers used by Google, can you roughly breakdown what they are
used for, i.e., 3000 perform searches, 1000 do OEMs, 500 do web
crawling, etc.?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: Without giving
specific numbers, we can say approximately 80% of the machines are
used for performing searches (google.com and partners); about 10%
of the machines are used for Research and Development and another
10% of the machines are used for preproduction (crawling and
indexing the web).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Are the tools worth
releasing to the Open Source community?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: That's an
interesting question. I mean, I don't know of too many
installations that are of comparable size to ours, but it certainly
is, now that you mention it, something we would consider. I don't
think that any of them are robust enough or clean enough at this
point and time. But, I think we can get them to that state if other
people would take over the maintenance and contribute. I just don't
think that there are too many people who would end up using
them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Could you briefly
tell us something about yourself and how you came to work at
Google?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: I was born in Moscow
and came to the United States at the age of six. I grew up in
Maryland, then went to the computer science program at Stanford. I
started there in 1993, where I worked on data mining, which
basically involves analyzing vast amounts of data to find
interesting correlations and patterns. Then Larry joined in 1995.
He started downloading the Web and we analyzed its link structure.
We've worked together from then on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Well, thanks so much
for your time. Take care.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Sergey</b></span>: Thank you.</p></div></div>
