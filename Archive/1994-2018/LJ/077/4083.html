drastic change in how Linux is viewed by gamers. No longer
relegated to the role of just a dedicated server, gamers are using
Linux in increasing numbers as their primary OS and as their gaming
platform. And as if using Linux wasn't a challenge enough in
itself, anyone trying to set up a Linux box to play a 3-D game will
find the path fraught with a plethora of confusing acronyms and
names. From OpenGL to DRI to DGA, each term refers to a particular
part of the full scene of Linux graphics. Here we put those pieces
together for our readers to give them a broader view of what Linux
has to offer now and what it will offer, in the near future.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe38c90"></a>What is OpenGL?</h2></div></div><p>We start by looking at OpenGL, a name that's gotten a lot of
use lately, especially in reference to games and professional
design applications. Originally called IRIS GL, OpenGL (Open
Graphics Library) is a programming library that provides a rich
array of graphics functions, both 2-D and 3-D, allowing the
programmer to represent any object they design on the screen. It
was developed by Silicon Graphics (SGI) and has become a standard
graphics application programming interface (API) on many platforms
including UNIX, Linux, Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh. While
OpenGL is the standard for high-end graphics applications where
programmers have found it powerful and easy to use, most people
have heard of OpenGL in reference to the Quake series of games from
id Software. It has been used as part of the graphics renderer
since Quake 1, where it has shown itself to be a powerful game
graphics API as well. The standard for OpenGL is an open one,
independent of hardware platforms, windowing systems and operating
systems. Thus the word &ldquo;Open&rdquo; as part of the name.</p><p>In order for OpenGL to be used in an OS, someone must create
a library to implement the function calls OpenGL programs make.
However, to call your implementation by the name &ldquo;OpenGL&rdquo;, you
must actually obtain a license from SGI (or Microsoft). In fact,
getting a license will earn you a package of code, called a Sample
Implementation and written in C, from which you can build your
OpenGL library on your platform. But since the standard for OpenGL
is an open one, working from the SI isn't required. In fact, that's
what Mesa is all about: it is an implementation created from
scratch without a license from SGI and without any code from SGI.
To use the OpenGL trademark, however, you must get a license from
SGI and your implementation must be robust enough to pass a set of
conformance tests developed by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board
(ARB). The ARB historically consisted primarily of high-end
hardware manufacturers and SGI itself, but now includes some game
hardware manufacturers. It is worth noting that, while SGI created
OpenGL, the future of the API is controlled by the ARB where SGI
sits as one of many members.</p><p>Recently, SGI released a Sample Implementation (SI) that can
be used to implement the API on any hardware platform with an
appropriate compiler. This source code is very similar to the one
sold to hardware vendors that implement OpenGL drivers for their
video cards. While it has been said that the SI is now open-source
software, this isn't entirely true. As of this writing, there are
still some issues with the license attached to the SI that prevent
it from being truly open.</p><p>Many people associate OpenGL with hardware acceleration.
While it is true that OpenGL runs very quickly when it has hardware
assistance, that acceleration is not required to run an OpenGL
application. With a software OpenGL library, OpenGL applications
can run and render the same image as they would with hardware
acceleration, albeit significantly slower unless the program is
very simple. When hardware acceleration is available (in the form
of a 3-D graphics card and a driver written for that card), OpenGL
applications can run very quickly and smoothly, since most of the
intense operations have been offloaded from the CPU to the
dedicated graphics board. However, not every accelerator has the
ability to perform all the features of OpenGL. When a feature is
not supported in hardware, the library may fall back to a software
implementation which uses your CPU. For example, very few
consumer-class video cards will do transform and lighting
(T&amp;L), so normal triangle setup is often done partially in
hardware and the rest in software.</p><p>Since its initial creation, OpenGL has undergone several
revisions and now stands at version 1.2.</p><p>In Linux, the implementation of OpenGL used most often is
Mesa, created by Brian Paul.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe38f50"></a>Mesa: Open Source OpenGL</h2></div></div><p>Mesa is an unlicensed implementation of the OpenGL standard
that is available on several platforms, including Linux, Windows
and Macintosh. Originally started in 1995, it has been under
development ever since by a team of developers led by Brian Paul.
Mesa is freely available and open source, so anyone can work with
the source code and port it to another operating system. For the
most part, OpenGL applications can compile and run against a Mesa
library just as they would against a licensed OpenGL
library.</p><p>Provisions for hardware acceleration are incorporated into
Mesa. For example, owners of a 3dfx card may choose to download and
install the Glide SDK from 3dfx and then recompile Mesa from its
source code. When Mesa configures itself for compilation, it should
detect the installed Glide headers and libraries and consequently
add the necessary code to allow the 3dfx card to accelerate many of
the OpenGL functions (via Glide 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>).</p><p>Like OpenGL, Mesa has undergone several revisions. As of Mesa
2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, the OpenGL 1.1 standard has been
supported. The later Mesa 3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> library is an
implementation of the OpenGL 1.2 standard, and thus should be
nearly as current as OpenGL itself. Mesa also includes support for
GLUT and GLU.</p><p>So now we have OpenGL, a programming interface for creating
3-D graphics, and an open-source implementation called Mesa. The
next part of the puzzle is the glue that joins OpenGL and the X
Window system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe39268"></a>GLX: Using OpenGL with X Windows</h2></div></div><p>As OpenGL is platform- and system-independent, it is also
window-system-independent. Thus, it needs a window system binding
to allow it to interact with the window system. This binding
provides the functionality for actions like finding the location of
a window on the screen or how to process input. In the case of UNIX
and Linux systems, that's GLX, a library that allows OpenGL and X
to operate together. (In the case of Microsoft Windows, it's called
WGL.) That is, with GLX, it is possible to have OpenGL utilize an X
window for its output. Even when you're using Mesa (full-screen or
non-DRI; we'll explain DRI in just a moment), there's a fake GLX
implementation to make the system think it is running under the
normal window system binding. The GLX currently used in Linux is
based on the source code released by SGI in February, 1999.</p><p>Some of you might even have run across the term Utah-GLX.
What is Utah-GLX, and what part does it play in this puzzle?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe393c8"></a>Utah-GLX</h2></div></div><p>Utah-GLX is a project to add OpenGL capabilities to some
current video accelerators, like the Matrox G400/G200 cards and the
ATI Rage Pro and Rage 128 cards, while still using XFree86
3.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. The Utah-GLX driver uses indirect
rendering (and in some cases, a form of direct rendering) to
provide this kind of acceleration. However, as will be explained
shortly, this rendering incurs a performance penalty that prevents
the hardware from reaching its full potential.</p><p>Among other accomplishments, the Utah-GLX project has led to
the first hardware acceleration on the Linux PPC platform as well
as the first hardware acceleration for a laptop. In both of these
cases, the video card is the ATI Rage Pro.</p><p>Now that XFree86 4.0 has been released, the hope is that much
of the work in the Utah-GLX project can be ported to the DRI. While
there has been some talk of starting this move, as of this writing
it hasn't happened yet.</p><p>This talk of <span   class="emphasis"><em>indirect</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>direct</em></span> rendering naturally leaves some
unanswered questions. Let's take a closer look and see how the two
differ and where they are used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe396e0"></a>Indirect vs. Direct Rendering</h2></div></div><p>The difference between indirect and direct rendering is the
number of levels through which the data must pass. That is, how
much the data must be massaged before it is actually put in the
frame buffer of the video card to be displayed on a monitor. As one
would expect, the fewer the levels, the faster the image, and thus
the emphasis on direct rendering (via DRI) as part of XFree86
4.0.</p><p>When indirect rendering is used, data is copied from the
application issuing the graphics output to the X server, and from
there to the hardware. This incurs a performance penalty, since the
output from the application must be packaged into a form for the X
server and then, once X has done its job, the final output must be
packaged appropriately and sent to the hardware. In a normal 2-D
application, the speed of this process is adequate. However, in
today's CPU and memory-intensive 3-D applications, that overhead is
too unwieldy for adequate performance.</p><p>Direct rendering attempts to streamline this flow of data and
allows the application to access the hardware more directly. That
is, it allows an application to issue its drawing commands directly
to the graphics hardware, with only the minimum amount of necessary
intervention by the X server. This ability exists in XFree86 as the
Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI), developed by Precision
Insight.</p><p>Finally, we get to talk about this mysterious DRI that has
come up in our discussion a couple of times. So without further
ado, read on to learn more about DRI and what it means for Linux
users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe398f0"></a>DRI: Security, Stability, Speed</h2></div></div><p>The Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) is a technology
developed by Precision Insight to add a direct rendering ability to
an X server. In more common terms, DRI allows applications to
safely and efficiently access the hardware directly while
cooperating with the X server. Unlike Utah-GLX, it doesn't require
privileged users or privileged programs. Furthermore, the work
takes place in the application instead of in the X server.</p><p>More technically, one can think of DRI as three parts: a
special X server, a direct rendering client and a kernel-level
device driver. The special X server for Linux is XFree86 4.0, whose
code contains special DRI modifications. The direct rendering
client consists of several smaller components. The most important
of these are an OpenGL implementation (in most cases Mesa), GLX as
developed by PI from SGI's code, and driver libraries from PI that
are Linux-specific (but hardware-independent). The kernel-level
device driver is a module that abstracts direct memory access for
hardware. It is designed in such a way that only the minimum of
kernel modification should be needed in the future.</p><p>In short, DRI is hardware acceleration &ldquo;done right&rdquo;. Since
it doesn't require special programs or privileges, there is an
inherent level of security which current hardware-acceleration
implementations may not have. Also, it is part of the XFree86
server and has undergone a significant amount of testing. With such
a development system, the hope is that users can count on the usual
stability associated with XFree86. Finally, the direct access to
hardware gives Linux and XFree86 the chance to act as a solid, fast
platform for professional graphics applications and demanding 3-D
games.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0xe39aa8"></a>Loose Odds and Ends</h2></div></div><p>In addition to DRI, OpenGL, Mesa and the other terms, there
are some smaller parts of the picture that you, faithful reader,
are likely to have come across. Let's take a minute to go over each
of them briefly.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>GLUT began as a library called aux developed by
Mark Kilgard (formerly of SGI, now at NVIDIA) to make programming
examples easier in his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>OpenGL Programming for the X
Window System</em></span>. This library was eventually improved and
has matured into GLUT.</p></li><li><p>DGA is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>direct graphics
architecture</em></span>. It is a very simple extension to the X
server that allows applications to have direct access to the frame
buffer. Users and applications need to have privileges to use DGA.
With those permissions, they can get access to the frame buffer
memory and draw, unaccelerated, on the screen. With the release of
XFree86 4.0, DGA 2.0 will be included, bringing some hardware
acceleration to basic 2-D drawing functions. In addition to the
graphics abilities, DGA allows an application to read peripherals
like the mouse and keyboard more directly. Normally, signals from
those input devices pass through the X server before they can be
used by an application.</p></li><li><p>VidMode&mdash;the vidmode extension allows an
application to query the X server for the resolutions it supports
and tell the X server to change to a specific resolution. This is
often used in games that want to run at a specific size when your
desktop is set to a different resolution.</p></li><li><p>Glide is the 3-D API developed by 3dfx for their
Voodoo line of cards to provide fast, full-screen hardware
acceleration. Its functionality was designed to match that of the
Voodoo hardware 3dfx had created. Many early 3-D accelerated games,
like Tomb Raider, used Glide. With the widespread acceptance of
OpenGL for both productivity and entertainment applications, the
importance of Glide has diminished. Consequently, 3dfx opted to
release the source code and specifications to the public, a move
which allowed its spread to other platforms.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd40580.0x1144d38"></a>Putting it All Together</h2></div></div><p>Let's review: OpenGL is a library that facilitates the
creation of 3-D graphics. Under Linux, there is an open-source
library called Mesa which provides OpenGL compatibility. We have
GLX to provide a standard way for OpenGL applications to work with
X. For people still using XFree86 3.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and
certain video cards, Utah-GLX provides some OpenGL functionality
similar to the type that XFree86 4.0 and DRI provide. With XFree86
4.0, however, users get maximized 2-D and 3-D performance, better
integration and more secure operation.</p><p>So there you have it. We can see how all the parts fit
together and their dependencies upon one another.</p><p><a href="4083s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
