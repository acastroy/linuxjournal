encountered UNIX via Coherent and then later turned to Linux, I
want to let you know that <i  >Linux Journal</i>
provided me with many interesting articles on new and useful
open-source products.</p><p>As the Linux user base continues to grow,
<i  >LJ</i> is faced with addressing the needs among
the growing ranks of newbies as well as those who have followed
Linux for several years now. Hopefully, <i  >LJ</i>
will strike a good balance. I for one thoroughly enjoy articles on
&ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo; items, such as kernel internals, libraries and
shared module implementation.</p><p>Also, case studies are great. At work, we are very interested
in using Linux for noncritical &ldquo;ancillary&rdquo; applications. These
case studies help us learn from and avoid any mistakes others may
have made.</p><p>Keep up the good work, and don't shy from the in-depth
stuff.</p><p>PS: The &ldquo;centerfold&rdquo; in the June issue was more than a
little tongue-in-cheek, and although I found it somewhat funny, it
seemed out of place in a quasi-technical magazine.  &mdash;Allan

<i  >LJ</i> and SSC almost beyond all reason. Why is
the <i  >Linux Journal</i> eCommerce site
(store.linuxjournal.com) running on NT and IIS? Don't you people
have a fundamental problem with that? How could you betray the
Linux community in such a manner?</p><p>Is there some extenuating circumstance? Is this some sort of
mistake? How little faith do you have in Linux that you would do
this thing?</p><p>These are not rhetorical questions. If I don't get a
satisfactory answer, my subscription is history. I read
<i  >LJ</i> front to back every month, and I would miss
it terribly, but I will not support you if your politics are wrong:
in a capitalist society, a dollar spent is a vote cast. Why are you
voting for Microsoft?  &mdash;Dale Lakes dale@multiverse.com</p><p>In order to serve our store customers better, we wanted to
outsource the web presence and fulfillment to the same company. WAS
offers this service, and plans to port their software to AIX. This
was the best alternative we could find. If you know someone running
Linux who offers the needed services, let us know &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2519580.0x26117c0"></a>Problem with Dynamic Class Loading</h2></div></div><p>I read the article &ldquo;Dynamic Class Loading for C++&rdquo; in the
May issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I've been
experimenting with this technique awhile, and I experienced a
problem that is not mentioned. I had some name clashes between
libraries: if two libraries have an internal class, function or
public symbol with the same name in both, once they are loaded, the
executable behavior is unpredictable.</p><p>It seems that when a library is linked in, the dynamic linker
starts searching all libraries for symbols, even for the libraries'
internal ones. I do not know if this problem was solved in recent
versions of the dynamic linker, or if there is a linker option I
missed.</p><p>I solved it by putting all internal symbols in name spaces.
Making sure there were no name spaces with the same name in two
libraries (unless desired) eliminated the odd behavior.  &mdash;Dario

issue and found it very instructive, since as a &ldquo;late&rdquo; Linux
user, I ashamedly confess I didn't know all the names listed in
it.</p><p>However, I think two more people deserve to have their names
written on the &ldquo;Linux Hall of Fame&rdquo;: Paul McKerras and David
Hinds (hope I didn't misspell their names) for PPP and PCMCIA.
Without them, I wouldn't be able to send you this e-mail (I run
Linux on a notebook).</p><p>I know we have to do a sort of lightweight patching on the
kernel sources for these to work, but I am really thankful.  &mdash;Nguyen

now. Everybody is lamenting a lot lately about the &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; of
having Microsoft Office for Linux as the definitive way for Linux
to succeed on the desktop. I happen to have some reservations about
that.</p><p>First of all, I am lucky enough to work at a UNIX-centric
office, so having Linux on my workstation is a given. Aside from my
primary job functions, I use Office (StarOffice, that is) for
office-related stuff. I use word processors and spreadsheets
equally. I used to have Windows on a separate partition as a
dual-boot machine, but it's gone now. I needed the space for
something else.</p><p>The office suite problem still exists for me, though. Being
bilingual, I often need to use Russian fonts/encodings on a variety
of machines, mostly Linux (x86 and PPC) and Macintosh. Well, it
also has to be readable on Windows. MS Word has its own most weird
(incompatible) way of encoding (I'd say scrambling) Russian
characters, rendering them unreadable on any other
hardware/software configuration. So it's unusable for me, period.
StarOffice is actually very good in creating nice portable
bilingual documents that can be imported into practically any other
application. Bummer there's no StarOffice for Macintosh! Corel
WordPerfect has the same limitations as StarOffice, but it is even
further restricted regarding the OS (no Solaris version). The only
&ldquo;word processor&rdquo; that is actually available for any platform/OS
and works with any national character set is Netscape Communicator.
The output of this application beats all competition in terms of
universality and portability, but it does suck as a word
processor.</p><p>Bottom line: I need an office suite that is reasonably
full-featured (like StarOffice), available for all major and minor
OS platforms (like Netscape), produces absolutely portable text
output (again, like Netscape) and doesn't cost an arm and a leg
(like Netscape and StarOffice). I want to reiterate that
incompatible features of MS Office make it unacceptable for me even
for free. Does anybody use a non-stolen version of MS Office
anyway?  &mdash;Alex Aitouganov Alex.Aitouganov@Eclipsys.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2519580.0x2611d98"></a>Artists' Guide to the Linux Desktop</h2></div></div><p>I have enjoyed your guide to the Linux desktop series
immensely, and I was delighted to see that you wrote about my
favorite window manager, Window Maker. Of course, I wasn't too
terribly happy with your lack of praise for my darling, but still,
I don't want to start a holy/flame war. I merely wanted to inform
you of one thing.  &mdash;Robert Wade robertwade@rocketmail.com</p><p>I'm glad you liked the series. There is one more coming,
which should be out in the next couple of months, that does basic
coverage of the remainder of the window managers out
there.  &mdash;Michael J. Hammel mjhammel@graphics-muse.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2519580.0x2611ef8"></a>Exaggerations</h2></div></div><p>I know that exaggerating about how long one has been using
Linux is a long-standing tradition for some people in the
community, but it's getting a little out of hand.</p><p>In the June 2000 issue on page 98, the article claims that H.
J. Lu discovered Linux in 1990. That's simply amazing, since Linus
announced the project on July 3, 1991.
(<a href="http://www.li.org/li/linuxhistory.shtml" target="_self">www.li.org/li/linuxhistory.shtml</a>)</p><p>Perhaps Mr. Lu has the capability of seeing into the
future?  &mdash;Dave Whitinger dave@whitinger.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2519580.0x2612108"></a>Security Implications</h2></div></div><p>I neglected to mention an important point in my article on
syslogd in the July issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>: If
you plan to use the network features of syslogd, it is very
important that this port be behind a strong and properly configured
firewall router. If not, the feature should not be used. The
network syslogd interface is a great way to do remote denial of
service attacks, and even some far more insidious attacks. The
denial of service can be to both CPU and disk, since sending tons
of spurious messages can make syslogd fill a disk drive. Moreover,
such messages may be used to obscure other evil activities which
you might lose in a flood of phony messages.</p><p>Even more frightening is the possibility that you are
watching some log files with, say, poorly written Perl scripts that
interpolate variables containing strings from syslog-generated log
files. There are some clever Perl hacks where you can compose
strings that will execute programs as the user running the script.
Such strings could be embedded in fake messages sent to your syslog
d&lt;\#230;&gt;mon.</p><p>The upshot of all this is that while collecting logs from
multiple machines over a network is a very nice and useful feature,
you must be sure to prevent machines outside your network from
reaching this port.</p><p>This is an important point, and I hope you can find room for
my letter! Thanks a lot!</p><p>Here is the corrected Listing 1 to include with my other
comment.</p><p>Due to an accident of typesetting, the syslog.conf listing in
the July 2000 issue was incorrect. The correct listing appears
below.</p><p><a href="4191l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>&mdash;Michael A. Schwarz mschwarz@sherbtel.net</p></div></div>
