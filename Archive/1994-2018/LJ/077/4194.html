being developed comes from PenguinRadio. The company was founded by
Andrew Leyden and is working toward providing the world with an
Internet-based car radio that will allow access to thousands of
stations&mdash;from anywhere in the world. Imagine listening to your
favorite radio station from Madrid (if you have one) while driving
away from the latest black tie affair at the Gates mansion, outside
of Seattle. This will be possible, eventually, thanks to
PenguinRadio.

</p><p>While they are still in the development and venture
capital-raising stages, the prospects are exciting. By partnering
with wireless communications developer Ineva.com, PenguinRadio may
be able to differentiate itself from Kerbango, its nearest
competitor. Ellipso, Inc., called a &ldquo;sister company&rdquo; by Ineva,
will provide the satellite technology that makes listening to any
station, anywhere, possible. Ellipso, as mentioned on their web
site, has three patents covering their &ldquo;elliptical orbit and
deployment characteristics&rdquo;. They have found a way to link
satellites high above the earth in order to provide uninterrupted
service nearly anywhere in the world.</p><p>I talked with PenguinRadio CEO Andrew Leyden about the latest
developments at PenguinRadio.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Why Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: There was never a
debate as to the operating system for the PenguinRadio. Not only
did Linux meet our needs technically (scalable, stable,
inexpensive) but it also fit our ideals philosophically. We believe
very strongly in working with others to develop new products that
are going to bring the Internet (and Linux) to more people.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: How has Linux worked
so far? What problems have you encountered?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: When we first
started developing our box, we were occasionally stumped by
hardware conflicts and a lack of drivers for certain parts of the
radio, but the Linux community has proven to be a great resource
for us in helping us develop this product. We've e-mailed and
chatted with people all over the world who have offered
suggestions, given guidance and pointed us to the right way to make
a device like this become a reality.</p><p>One problem that has yet to be overcome is the view (in some
quarters) that Linux is little better than shareware. We've
demonstrated this not to be the case, but some of those with money
and software necessary to make a box like this work are not totally
committed to the idea of Linux. They'd like to see machines work on
more established systems backed up by &ldquo;professional&rdquo; (i.e., paid)
support.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: You said that when
first developing with Linux &ldquo;we were occasionally stumped by
hardware conflicts...&rdquo; Could you provide an example?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Some of the less
expensive hardware we were experimenting with had poorly supported
sound chips, making it difficult to produce glitch-free audio
output at the $200 price point.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: What operating system
do you use at work/home?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We've got a mishmash
of machines around our offices and home. We use Macs for a lot of
our web design work, Windows machines for some of our office
functions, and Linux boxes to keep them all running straight. Our
chief designer actually has a Linux box set up to maintain a web
cam in his house so he can check up on his dogs while he's at
work.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: When is the product
expected to be available to the public?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Our goal remains
sometime this summer or fall, but in order to make the device easy
enough for my mother to use (i.e., she knows how to dial the phone)
I have to spend more time making it easier to use.</p><p>People expect a radio to work every time they turn it on.
Computers can crash and have blue screens of death, but a radio is
something that you turn on and it works. If it doesn't, you throw
it out and get a new one. We need to meet this expectation of a
100% fool proof device, which is a bit difficult.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: What is the projected
price range?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We feel we can get
these devices out in the $200-$250 U.S. price range.</p><p>This is what we consider the &ldquo;one spouse&rdquo; price point,
i.e., one spouse can purchase without the permission of the other.
Your mileage may vary on this...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: What station would
you listen to from, say, Cairns, Australia?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We currently have
about 50 Australian radio stations in our database, including a few
from around Queensland, and are working to improve this number on a
daily basis.</p><p>There's actually a very strong interest in a product like
this in island nations like New Zealand, Australia and the U.K.,
where traditional radio has very real geographic
limitations.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Could you please
provide a bit of background information about yourself and your
company?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Most recently I
served as Counsel to the Commerce Committee of the House of
Representatives in Washington, D.C. This is the committee of
jurisdiction over the telecommunications network, the Internet and
all commerce in the United States. I conducted a number of
oversight matters into technology, and it was while working with
the committee that I came up with the idea of the
PenguinRadio.</p><p>I was spending some time writing a memo, playing a streaming
media feed in the background when I ran into a problem many people
have confronted: the computer could not handle the decoding and the
other task at the same time. There were blips and beeps and delays.
Initially I said, &ldquo;buy a new computer that is more powerful&rdquo;, but
then it hit me, &ldquo;no, go the other way. Make a streaming media
device.&rdquo; I did a bit of research into the sector and decided this
would be a great device to have in my own house, regardless of
whether or not I sold a million units. I left the committee about a
year ago, raised an angel round from some interesting investors and
recently closed on my first VC round from the Internet Partnership
Group.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Will you be releasing
any of your work to the Open Source community?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We haven't figured
out what is going to be released and what is to stay with us, but
I'm pushing hard to be generous to the Open Source community as
they have been so helpful with us. We already allow other web pages
access to our portal of thousands of radio stations and plan to
work with other device manufacturers to allow them access to the
work we've been conducting.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: What sort of help do
you need from the Open Source community, in terms of development
work and so on?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: Comments,
suggestions, rants, raves. Whatever they feel might be helpful, or
any problems they've encountered in working on embedded systems are
greatly appreciated.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Which Linux kernel
are you using?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We've been
experimenting mostly with the 2.2 series.</p><p>At this stage, we want to use a fairly modern kernel and
we're not as concerned about the kernel size, since memory is cheap
and getting cheaper all the time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Have you released the
source code to your Linux port?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We don't mean to
sound evasive, but the streaming audio landscape is evolving and
changing so quickly that we're not ready to release anything at
this point. Our work is mostly in writing customized applications,
so there's nothing really tricky or unusual with the distribution
that we'll use.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Is there a demo of
the radio available, or are you still in the development
stage?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: We have built some
prototypes, but there's not an official demo unit.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Who would you
identify as your main competition?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andrew</b></span>: As far as the
hardware arena is concerned, the company formerly known as Kerbango
comes to mind. But that's just one dimension of PenguinRadio. We've
partnered with Ineva.com to deliver Internet radio just about
anywhere a satellite signal can be received. PenguinRadio is also
geared towards the wireless community, as we deliver the sounds of
the Internet via our stripped-down portal, phoneradio.com.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jason</b></span>: Thank you for your
time, and best of luck.</p></div></div>
