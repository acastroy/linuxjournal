MS-Windows-based long-distance telephone calls on the Internet.
Under the hood, you will find embedded Linux.</p><p>Telecommunications is a huge market that continues to grow at
a frightening pace. As the market becomes more sophisticated, the
need for intelligent devices grows as well. A relatively new piece
of the telecommunications market is voice over ID, or VoIP. This is
where speech is digitized and sent over an IP-based network.</p><p>The most common products in this market combine an MS-Windows
PC and sound card with proprietary software to offer the equivalent
of free long-distance telephone calls by using the Internet.</p><p>This approach has its drawbacks. You must have an MS-Windows
PC turned on and available in order to place or receive phone
calls. Enter Aplio or, more specifically, Aplio/Pro, a stand-alone
appliance that allows you to make telephone calls over the
Internet.</p><p>Like any other VoIP solution, you need a system at each end
to make the call. Unlike most solutions, with Aplio you don't need
computers on each end. While Aplio has had products in this market,
Aplio/Pro amounts to their transition to open-source
software.</p><p>Henri Tebeka, chief technology officer for Aplio, said,
&ldquo;Linux is the ideal operating system for our technology. Its
built-in Internet connectivity, royalty-free accessibility and
open-source structure will allow us to streamline our development
process, and ultimately strengthen our position as the leading
provider of Internet telephony appliance technology.&rdquo; Combining
Linux with the growing improvements in VoIP technology, Aplio
brings a progressive development model to bear on one of the most
vital areas of the Internet's growth as a truly multimedia, mass
network capable of delivering voice data as seamlessly as it does
text, still graphics and video.</p><p>Aplio/Pro features a built-in processor along with a modem,
flash RAM, hardware-based full-duplex voice compression and a
full-duplex speakerphone.</p><p>Jerome Calvo, president and CEO of Aplio, Inc. said, &ldquo;Are
users going to want to talk over the phone through their computer?
With a headset? The approach we have is a non-PC approach, an
Internet appliance approach, a stand-alone device...The voice over
IP market is much more mature than it was one or two years
ago...Still, some companies have since joined the VoIP market with
software-based solutions that often don't deliver the same level of
quality.&rdquo;</p><p>Setting up Linux-based Aplio/Pro is easy. It connects to a
telephone as simply as an answering machine and plugs into an
Ethernet port.</p><p>Configuring the Aplio/Pro involves little more than entering
Internet account information on the telephone keypad. There is a
ten-digit number (the Aplio ID, located under the unit) which
represents the ID or phone number of the Aplio unit. It can then
send calls to other Aplio systems, as well as to those using
multimedia computers with Internet telephony software such as
Microsoft's NetMeeting.</p><p>To place a call, you pick up the telephone receiver (assuming
the speakerphone is not being used), press the &ldquo;Aplio&rdquo; button on
the unit's console, dial the Aplio ID of the individual being
called and wait for the phone to ring on the other end of the line.
Calling to or from an Aplio unit with an Internet telephony-enabled
PC is just as easy.</p><p>To use Aplio behind a firewall or NAT (Network Address
Translation) box, all that's necessary is to open up the
appropriate ports much like you would do with ICQ or other
real-time transfer protocols.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcb1580.0xda9818"></a>Evolution of the Aplio Product Line</h2></div></div><p>How does Linux fit into Aplio's picture? Fresh on the heels
of its Internet telephony appliance success, Aplio embarked upon a
project to develop a broadband version for the enterprise. Whereas
the Aplio/Phone works over average PSTN (public switched telephone
network) lines and runs the proprietary PSOS real-time operating
system developed by Integrated Systems, Inc. (now a part of Wind
River Systems, Inc.), Aplio/Pro is a Linux-based, stand-alone,
Internet telephony appliance that routes to the Internet.
Aplio/Pro, like the Aplio/Phone, has won its share of
commendations, namely Product of the Year awards from both
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Telephony</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Communications Solutions</em></span> magazines earlier
this year. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet Telephony</em></span> said, &ldquo;in our
opinion, the best VoIP appliance is Aplio/Pro...&rdquo; And while
acknowledging the value of some competing products from Innomedia,
InterStar and Komodo, the review concluded that &ldquo;the Aplio/Pro is
the best choice for ease of setup, economy of scale and overall
usability.&rdquo;</p><p>Aplio/Pro's operating system is Aplio's embedded port of the
Linux kernel. The port is adapted from ucLinux/ARM (which is itself
a port of uClinux, a Linux version for micro-controllers without a
memory management unit or mmu). Aplio's TRIO chip was the first
port of ucLinux/ARM. The ucLinux kernel was built by taking the
standard 2.0.38 kernel and applying the ARM patches and the ucLinux
patches. After some &ldquo;manual editing&rdquo;, ucLinux for ARM7TDMI was
ready to roll.</p><p>Said Vadim Lebedev, chief software engineer for Aplio and the
one who led the porting of ucLinux to ARM7TDMI, &ldquo;the porting of
the kernel itself was not especially difficult, the biggest problem
was adapting the GCC/ARM compiler to generate position-independent
code for user-mode application.&rdquo; Lebedev first got involved with
Linux during the development of the Aplio/Pro VoIP appliance and
noted that the decision to use ucLinux for the Aplio/Pro (and for
future TRIO chip-based products) was due to three primary reasons.
For one, the availability of the source code and access to
open-source software tools made modifications and enhancements
easier and more efficient. Second, the ability to &ldquo;comfortably&rdquo;
develop and test the code on Linux workstations, and then embed the
code on the device by recompiling, was deemed a major advantage.
And third, the high level of support Lebedev and his development
team could get from the broader community of Linux developers meant
that the project would not be isolated from further innovations in
both Linux and embedded systems. Added Lebedev, &ldquo;[now] we can say
it is really much easier to develop Linux-based embedded software
than, let's say, PSOS-based software...I do believe that Linux has
a pretty bright future in the embedded world&mdash;even if [Linux] was
not initially meant to be used in this way.&rdquo;</p><p>The newly developed Aplio/TRIO chip provides the connection
to the Internet (by way of an internal Ethernet port) while at the
same time providing real-time voice compression and echo
cancellation. The Aplio/TRIO is based around an ARM7TDMI
micro-controller core running at 20MHz and a pair of DSP
co-processors running at 40MHz. In a general, stand-alone
environment such as the Aplio/Phone, one of the DSP co-processors
manages voice processing, including voice compression and echo
cancellation, while the other co-processor handles the telephony
functions such as dialing, caller ID detection, etc.</p><p><a href="4197s1.html" target="_self">Wherefore VoIP? Wherefore
Aplio?</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcb1580.0xda9be0"></a>Aplio and the VoIP Marketplace</h2></div></div><p>According to statistics from aplio.com, the market for
VoIP/Internet telephony is expected to explode. One research
company, Probe Research Inc., suggests that the total traffic for
Internet telephony will reach or exceed 250 billion conversation
minutes by 2005. Aplio recorded its five millionth minute in June
1999.</p><p>Calvo notes that 70% of those who use the Aplio/Phone and
Aplio/Pro are what he calls members of &ldquo;ethnic communities&rdquo; or
those &ldquo;global citizens&rdquo; who work in one country yet often have
family or other strong ties to another country. These core
Aplio/Phone users would otherwise face heavy long-distance charges
without a solution such as VoIP. Similarly, Calvo estimates that
the remaining 30% of Aplio's customer base consists of
internationally oriented businesses, who are also looking to avoid
long-distance tolls while conducting business around the
world.</p><p>Asked to characterize the Aplio premium on VoIP Internet
appliances, Calvo offered the expected: (1) Aplio/Phone and
Aplio/Pro are non-PC products; (2) both appliances have &ldquo;extremely
good&rdquo; voice quality; and (3) both Aplio/Phone and Aplio/Pro
feature easy-to-manage user interfaces. &ldquo;Our goal is to have many
companies build[ing] many different appliances. In that sense,
betting on an open-source operating system like Linux is a good
thing, because we can very quickly prototype, develop and test our
products and get them to market.&rdquo;</p></div></div>
