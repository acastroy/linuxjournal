</p><p>While the Palm has always been the top dog of palmtops for
Linux users and Yopy (see &ldquo;Linley on Linux&rdquo;,
<i  >LJ</i>, September 2000) is the first kid on the
block with Linux inside, there is Linux brewing at Compaq as well.
iPaq, the handheld pocket PC from Compaq, should have the attention
of most Linux lovers. While the shipping version runs Windows
Pocket PC, getting a Linux version of this 200MHz handheld with
32MB of flash RAM is as easy as surfing to the Compaq web site. And
what's more, the iPaq owes its very existence to open source and
Linux in general, and a research project called &ldquo;Itsy&rdquo; in
specific.</p><p>As Dick Greeley, program manager for the Open Handheld
program and a member of Compaq's Corporate Research team, said in a
recent interview, Compaq's study of handheld computing
devices&mdash;seeing what it was that made them so popular and what
could be done to improve on some of the product's deficiencies&mdash;had
it origins not in Compaq, but in Digital Equipment Corporation,
which Compaq acquired in 1998. Getting Digital's significant
research labs as part of the bargain, Compaq became the home for
Digital's &ldquo;Itsy&rdquo; project. The &ldquo;Itsy&rdquo; project was an attempt to
marshal many of the technological innovations in computing power,
screen quality and memory capacity for the burgeoning handheld
computer market. It is this project, started four years ago, that
eventually produced the iPaq.</p><p>&ldquo;Our goal in research,&rdquo; said Dick Greeley, &ldquo;is to look
into the future, to look beyond the time horizon of the existing
business units, so to that extent, we're looking out further than a
lot of these groups do.&rdquo; What he and his researchers saw was that
issues of power management and user interface were key to
developing handhelds that would be popular and able to exploit the
developments that were leading to the incredible shrinking machine.
&ldquo;While all these devices could shrink,&rdquo; Greeley noted, &ldquo;our
fingers can't, our eyes and ears can't...so we needed to start
thinking about how the user interface of the future is going to
work with these devices...what can and can't be done and how will
people really want to relate to them.&rdquo;</p><p>Building a better user interface for handhelds led the Itsy
team to a number of interesting innovations, one of which was the
addition of a 3-D accelerometer which enabled a user to measure
when the Itsy unit was tilted or moved. What good was this? Greeley
calls it a &ldquo;rock and scroll&rdquo; interface. &ldquo;The idea is that as you
flip the unit around in your hand, it would be basically
programmable and would do different things for you,&rdquo; he explained,
using the example of being able to turn pages on a particular
application simply by flipping the wrist. So giddy had the Itsy
team become with the success of their early prototype device&mdash;which
was about the size of a deck of playing cards&mdash;that they even
loaded the popular action-shooter game, DOOM, onto it. Recalled
Greeley, &ldquo;I think my favorite aspect was how you cocked the
shotgun, by flipping the unit forward and backward.&rdquo;</p><p>Why did the Itsy team choose Linux as the development
operating system? Dick Greeley offers a number of reasons. For one,
like many developers, they wanted something they could play
with&mdash;from the source-code level up&mdash;on their own, without any
proprietary strings attached. Second, the fact of the matter was
that the Itsy project was not a secret; numerous developers from
the academic and research communities were also involved to one
degree or another. This involvement also led to the founding of the
<a href="http://www.handhelds.org" target="_self">www.handhelds.org</a>
web site and the Open Handhelds program, which has as its goal the
continued support of Linux on the iPaq, making the device available
to the research/development community.</p><p>While the Itsy team choose Linux as their operating system,
Greeley admits that, within Compaq, his research team is pretty
&ldquo;operating system agnostic&rdquo;. He adds, &ldquo;I think what's more
critical than necessarily the OS choice is the notion of going open
source, to be able to share and interchange the fruits of many
people's efforts and to have access to a wide variety of
applications that are out there, which makes innovation really
possible.&rdquo;</p><p>The transition from Itsy to iPaq took place when the newly
Compaq'd Itsy research team went looking around the company for a
new home for the project. Greeley says they found that home in
Compaq's iAppliances Group, who had been working on an iPaq desktop
PC and a new StrongARM-based handheld pocket PC. The iAppliances
pocket device did not have the Itsy's 3-D accelerometer, but it did
have the memory and expansion capabilities the Itsy researchers
wanted. As Greeley said, &ldquo;We proposed to them: Hey, let's launch
this, what we'll call the Open Handheld program...We'll take our
Linux port that we had originally done for Itsy, get it up to the
latest revision of the Linux kernel, and at the same time, adapt it
to work with the iPaq. This would be a great way to get people
innovating on our platform.&rdquo;</p><p>As for what might be called the Itsy/iPaq premium, Dick
Greeley points to a number of things he believes help set his
handheld apart from the rest of the pack. &ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;is the processing power. We've got a much faster processor
than everybody else.&rdquo; Second, he points to the iPaq screen, which
he suggests is at least as good, if not better, than others on the
market. &ldquo;You can look at the screen in bright daylight and still
see it,&rdquo; he insists. &ldquo;You could find your keys in the dark using
the screen like a flashlight,&rdquo; Greeley adds by way of example. The
iPaq screen also has both a variable brightness control as well as
an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts to the
environment. The unit also gets a maximum of 12-14 hours on its
battery, but one of the key features as far as Greeley is concerned
is the fact that the operating system (Microsoft Pocket PC standard
or Linux, available from the Compaq web site) is stored in flash
memory as opposed to being burned into ROM. This gives the user
increased ability to load Linux on the iPaq by loading into flash
instead of burning a new ROM. Says Greeley, &ldquo;That proved to be an
important thing for us and it's actually made our whole program
possible.&rdquo;</p><p>Only recently started, it is probably impossible to gauge how
much Linux developer interest will flow toward the Itsy/iPaq
project. Greeley himself notes that, with regard to the Linux port
to the iPaq, &ldquo;we don't have all the bells and whistles yet,&rdquo;
meaning there is no browser and the wireless Ethernet is enroute,
but has not yet arrived. The Linux Itsy does feature the X Window
System, however, and Greeley expects progress to come quickly.
&ldquo;We've started shipping the new iPaq in the last several weeks and
there's been very good demand for them...One of the things we've
heard a lot of the last week and a half is a lot of Linux people
saying, &ldquo;Finally! I've got my thing I can play with now! Thank you
for following through!&rdquo;--even though the product is not exactly
the same as the Itsy.</p></div></div>
