    Which embedded Linux tools are going to take

embedded systems. GNU/Linux as a platform for the next generation
of appliances, Internet or other, is one of those great no-brainer
technical decisions that comes along every few years. Kind of like
Cat-5 cable. But look at how many people agree. If embedded Linux
tools were on the shelf at your local computer store, it would take
a big shelf to hold them. So which embedded Linux company should
you look to when you decide to put Linux on your toaster, or your
company's new line of desktop machine tools?
</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> can't give you the answer,
because we don't know. But as somebody who has been in the Linux
business for a while, I can tell you what works for companies
trying to bottle the open-source lightning and sell it, and what
doesn't. Which embedded Linux tools are going to take off? That
depends on accessibility, responsiveness and freedom.</p><p><a href="4201s1.html" target="_self">Focus Articles</a></p><p>Accessibility is easy. Most of the people who will be
creating cool stuff with embedded Linux tomorrow are doing
something else today. Successful vendors won't assume all customers
are embedded systems experts. Maybe they're &ldquo;power users&rdquo; of the
product category they want to improve with Linux. Or hobbyists, or
students. A bundled set with software, documentation and a nifty
little targetboard would be a big hit.</p><p>Responsiveness is a matter of opening up the company to
customer questions and admitting mistakes. For a real-world example
of responsiveness in action, read some of what Donnie Barnes of Red
Hat posted to redhat-list, back when Red Hat was still refining its
distribution with lots of what I'll politely call &ldquo;user input&rdquo;.
Look for an embedded vendor that isn't afraid to let users help
make its products better.</p><p>Finally, freedom. Look for a vendor who keeps everything
under a license that meets the open-source definition, preferably
the GNU General Public License. License hassles are a recipe for
driving customers away, as proprietary embedded OS vendors are
learning.</p><p>What you see in this issue is just the beginning. A lot of
you are doing embedded projects right now. If you have an embedded
Linux success, let us at <i  >Linux Journal</i> know.
We'll be running step-by-step &ldquo;how I did it&rdquo; embedded articles in
future issues.</p></div></div>
