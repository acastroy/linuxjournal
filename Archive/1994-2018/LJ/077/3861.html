growing popularity of Linux&mdash;a book appears pretending to be a
reference, but the material is neither well-organized nor complete
enough to truly be called a reference for the subject.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Programmer's Reference</em></span> does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> fall into either category.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Programmer's Reference</em></span> is divided
into three parts, with seven chapters and three appendices. The
first part, Chapters 1, 2 and 3, involves the BASH, TCSH and Z
shells. It covers the configuration, initialization, creation and
execution of shell scripts, as well as a description of all
programming-related commands for the respective shell. In addition,
syntax, usage and short practical examples are given to make sure
the reader understands the idea.</p><p>The second part, Chapters 4 and 5, concerns the compiling,
debugging and packaging of C and C++ programs. Peterson covers
everything from binary formats, static vs. shared and dynamic
libraries, the <span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> debugger,
passing by the <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> utility, the
revision control system (<span   class="bold"><b>rcs</b></span>), up
to the man pages.</p><p>The author recognizes GNOME and KDE programming popularity by
including a chapter on each (Chapters 6 and 7) describing the
essentials of how to create GNOME and KDE interfaces.</p><p>Finally, the three appendices serve as a quick reference for
Perl, the Tcl/Tk scripting language, and TeX and LaTeX
commands.</p><p>The Perl appendix covers file commands, array operations,
operators, control structures, functions, pattern-matching
operations and regular expressions and subroutine components. The
Tcl/Tk appendix lists Tcl operators, the most common Tcl and Tk
commands, standard Tk widgets and Tk options. The TeX and LaTeX
appendix covers the essential commands of TeX and LaTeX.</p><p>As a Linux programming reference, the book has much to offer.
It presents valuable, precise programming syntax and advice for
every Linux programmer, whether you are a novice, intermediate or
expert programmer. In addition to syntax, it provides brief
explanations and programming examples for each command, as well as
advice on how, when and why to use each command, helping you choose
the most suitable one for your particular task.</p><p>The examples throughout the book are very structured, short
enough to type and try yourself, and still contain all the major
concepts intended to be present. In general, the use of examples
help to clear up questions the readers may have after reading the
concept materials, and Peterson's examples serve that purpose
well.</p><p>Petersen's writing style is clear and concise, making the
book easy to read and follow. However, someone on one of the
newsgroups complained that Petersen covers
<span   class="bold"><b>ci</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>co</b></span> commands for RCS without ever
noting that they stand for &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; and &ldquo;check-out&rdquo;, a
concept that surely makes rcs easier to understand. Such small
notions may seem not important for professionals, but they are of
great significance to newcomers&mdash;a matter to which Peterson might
have paid more attention.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Programmer's Reference</em></span> is not a
&ldquo;Learn-<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>-in-12-hours&rdquo; type of book. This
book is not meant to teach C, C++ or Perl. It is meant to serve as
a reference for those moments when you have a programming-related
question, such as when you've forgotten the syntax or wonder
whether a feature exists or not. This book will give all you need
to get a clear and concise answer without having to search
countless pages in different books or seek the help of your
colleagues.</p><p>The book, as a reference, can find its place on the
bookshelves of Unix-experienced users and programmers who are
migrating to Linux and want specific Linux information, especially
on critical <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> compiler and
library issues. Linux programmers and newcomers will also find it
very useful for its list of shell commands, its programming section
and the quick references.</p><p>Personally, I found this book to be a useful reference worth
the price ($16.99 US at Amazon.com). On the other hand, I felt the
author assumed the reader knows his way around Linux and its
programming tools. So, if you are a fresh, out-of-the-box newcomer,
expect to dirty your hands.</p><p>I received a number of comments from some reviewers wishing
there was more on scripting languages than the Perl and Tcl/Tk
listings in the appendices. I agree with them. If a solid chapter
on scripting languages was included instead, it would have been a
great book. Nevertheless, it's still a good book, well-written and
concise, and it covers the ground. If you need a good reference,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Programmer's Reference</em></span> is the book to
buy.</p></div></div>
