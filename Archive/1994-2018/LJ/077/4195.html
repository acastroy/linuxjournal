        As potential soars for the collaboration between embedded Linux and instant messaging,
        we are bracing for a deluge of new applications and services.
        More importantly, we stand on the threshold of a new way to think about&mdash;and use&mdash;the Internet.
      </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eec580.0x1fe4450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux. It's not just for computers any
more.</p><p>That's the message Linus Himself has been giving us ever
since he beat a career path to the Mobile Market when he went to
work for Transmeta in 1997. That market is just the computer-like
edge of a much larger category of devices that run on &ldquo;embedded&rdquo;
or &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; microprocessors and their operating
systems.</p><p>Lately, that market has developed a huge appetite for
Linux&mdash;so huge, in fact, that it's not hard to imagine Linux
quickly becoming the commodity embedded OS. Here's why:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Open source code</p></li><li><p>World's largest and most active Open Source
development community</p></li><li><p>Mature, proven and still evolving rapidly</p></li><li><p>Small size&mdash;one embedded version fits on a
floppy</p></li><li><p>Modular and easily customized</p></li><li><p>Net-native</p></li><li><p>Many development tools</p></li><li><p>Free&mdash;no runtime royalties required</p></li><li><p>A hot topic that gets lots of press coverage</p></li></ul></div><p>Even though Linux is not a real-time OS (RTOS), changes in
the hardware world make it much more desirable in many cases than
traditional RTOSes. The traditional RTOS worked in a world where
hardware was&mdash;by today's standards&mdash;slow, large, expensive and
specialized. An RTOS had to make the most of many different 4-, 8-
and 16-bit microprocessors, low clock speeds and tiny memory
footprints in relatively large packages. In addition, an RTOS had
to be crafted precisely to an application.
</p><p>In the RT world, applications were usually in highly isolated
markets. Even in the home, just about every potentially
&ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; real-time application belonged to a very isolated
professional specialty that had little if any interest in other
specialties. Home security, outdoor irrigation, fire-safety
sprinkler systems, heating and air conditioning, kitchen
appliances, entertainment systems, indoor and outdoor lighting,
telephones, computers and networks...these were all served by
different businesses with different kinds of expertise. For proof,
try to find a single contractor to install (much less service)
telephone, security, computer network and home entertainment
systems. The Net was never a factor for many of these categories,
so it was pointless to think of all of them in a connected context.
Their vendors didn't, even if their customers did.</p><p>Now, connected-context is increasingly the point. &ldquo;People
are going to have to think differently here&mdash;even people already in
the embedded space,&rdquo; says David Rieves, Director of Product
Marketing at Lineo, one of the leading embedded Linux companies.
&ldquo;Now, 32-bit hardware is cheap commodity stuff. So you hold
overhead down in the OS, which is why Linux is so appealing. As
hardware costs go down, interest in Linux goes up&rdquo;, especially for
devices that live on the Internet.</p><p>This means we need to start thinking about real-time
development in a network context. While the network context is old
hat for Linux, real time is not. The most familiar network
services&mdash;e-mail and the web&mdash;are both essentially store and
forward concepts. But to a growing community of Open Source
developers, the missing piece here is <span   class="emphasis"><em>instant
messaging</em></span> (IM), which, by definition, is much closer to
&ldquo;real&rdquo; time.</p><p>IM is a familiar concept to the tens of millions of AOL
customers who use AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) or ICQ, which AOL
also owns. Neither is open and deployable like Sendmail and Apache
for the obvious reason that AOL owns the services and enjoys
keeping them to itself. Even if you can create your own clients,
the servers are still AOL's. They control it all. As a result, most
of the world still understands IM in AOL's terms. This is why a
huge percentage of IM usage is what one wag (yours truly) once
called, &ldquo;fourteen-year-old girls cheating on their homework and
talking about boys in real time.&rdquo; Worse, AOL's breed of IM is
limited by its business model, which is all about selling captured
eyeballs to advertisers.</p><p>Once again, geeks are fixing the problem.</p><p>As usual, it started with a guy looking for a way to scratch
his own itch. The guy in this case was Jeremie Miller. In 1998,
Jeremie was working for an ISP when he started to think about IM as
a UNIX solution:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I found that more of the people I knew were
fooling around with AIM, and I ended up having a need to have all
of my UNIX utilities, all of my logging stuff, a lot of the UNIX
environment&mdash;wanting to use this new buddy list interactively in
real time...as a channel to feed my stuff through. Later on, I saw
there were open-source libraries to get back into ICQ and AIM and
stuff...and I thought about it for a couple weeks. The question
was, &ldquo;What's the best way to do this?&rdquo; I didn't want to build my
own client, because I can't do GUI stuff at all. I can only do
back-end server stuff. I thought &ldquo;Well, I could build a back-end
server, and make my own protocol; maybe I can convince somebody
else to write a client, and then they wouldn't have to update it
when I want features.&rdquo; Then I just start adding all the features
into the server. Then I can bridge that server to my UNIX things
that I want to add in...some logging announcements and any sort of
little things I want to push up into it. I can have that server
bridge over into pagers. I can have it bridge into ICQ and AIM so I
can talk to my friends using other clients. And it just grew from
there.</p></blockquote></div><p>The result was Jabber, the first Open Source instant
messaging platform. A cadre of developers quickly gathered around
the project&mdash;their site is Jabber.org&mdash;and built instant messaging
that any geek can deploy in the familiar manner of Sendmail and
Apache. Here is a description of Jabber's architecture, condensed
from the Jabber Technical White Paper :</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Every user interacts through a local server that
transfers messages to and through any number of other servers, each
with its own domain</p></li><li><p>Jabber Identifiers are also expressed like email:
yourname@domain.com</p></li><li><p>Clients and servers converse among themselves
through XML streams. In client/server conversations, the XML stream
is always initiated by the client to the server</p></li><li><p>The architecture can also support simple clients
(e.g., a direct telnet connection) as well as AIM, ICQ and other
proprietary clients</p></li><li><p>Since it is built on XML, Jabber is extensible and
able to express just about any kind of structured data</p></li><li><p>Jabber's own protocol consists of XML fragments
passed over XML streams between clients and servers. There are
three primary protocols that define the basic types of XML
fragments used in Jabber: Messages, Presence and Info/Query</p></li><li><p>Server-to-server communication involves routing
these protocol elements over an XML stream from one server to
another (there are no special server-to-server protocols or
features)</p></li><li><p>A Module API lets the server use external modules
to handle message filtering, storage facilities (off-line messages,
rosters, user info), user authentication and other functions</p></li><li><p>A Service API allows integration of security,
special connections for alternate clients and message
logging</p></li><li><p>Transport servers are used to bridge the Jabber
protocol to other services, such as IRC, ICQ and AIM</p></li></ul></div><p>Jabber is built so wide open that it's hard to see the limits
of what can be done with it. But that scope has less to do with IM
than with XML (Extensible Markup Language). Again, Jeremie:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As soon as I found out about XML, I kind of saw
it as doing to the IT industry or to the Internet the same thing
that silicon chips first did for the computing world&mdash;moving from
the transistor into ICs. It's almost the same kind of phase. XML
feels like that large of a change. It's morphing all the underlying
structures, speeding everything up, enabling everybody to structure
data in a way that other people can understand. Even if you don't
understand some of the pieces of the data, you can at least look at
the data and see the structure of that data. So XML was always part
of that server I was building in the background. And I was using
XML to push it onto the client.</p></blockquote></div>

</p><p>XML was created to package and exchange structured
data&mdash;files, blocks of text, drawings, transactions, settings,
whatever&mdash;on its own terms, outside the context of the programs
that produce them and (most importantly) outside the API and
protocol walls that keep services from interoperating over the Net.
XML provides the basic rules for organizing content but not for
identifying it. So, while XML resembles HTML in its use of tags, it
differs radically from HTML by not forcing a meaning for those tags
on the data itself. Those agreements are up to those communicating
within an XML framework. As for devices, they can include
anything.</p><p>XML's advantage is that it's text, plus a structured dynamic
framework for what you put in that text. So you can add an XML tag
to control anything from an industrial valve to a point-of-sale
terminal to a light switch in your home. A novel feature of XML is
the DTD, the Document Type Definition. With DTDs, you get to
specify document type from inside the document. This allows an
infinite variety of tags. The real estate industry, for example,
could create a tag called &ldquo;price.&rdquo; Everybody in the real estate
trade can know what that tag means and program their applications
accordingly. Anybody can build a DTD and publish it, which makes
the framework especially flexible. It also puts control in the
hands of developers working on real world projects and not just
standards bodies or large vendors with inflexible market
mass.</p><p>Table 1. Jabber Architecture Connection Map</p><p>T1 = N1 = C3</p><p>/</p><p>C1 -- S1 - S2 = C4</p><p>/</p><p>C2 - T2</p><p>Table 1 is a map of the typical connections within the Jabber

But lately, as President &amp; CEO of Webb, Inc.,
<a href="http://www.webb.net" target="_self">http://www.webb.net/</a>, he
and Webb have taken a greater interest in Jabber than any other
company to date. After learning about Jabber, Perry decided to fund
its development. Webb now pays Jeremie and other core Jabber.org
team members to work full-time on the open-source project. Webb
also created Jabber, Inc.,
<a href="http://www.jabber.com" target="_self">http://www.jabber.com/</a>,
to explore commercializing Jabber in ways that leverage and reward
its open-source development (and developers).</p><p>&ldquo;It is extremely significant that Jabber adopted XML as its
transport technique,&rdquo; Perry says, &ldquo;effectively allowing
conversations to incorporate structure&mdash;placing documents,
applications and message mining in the middle of a conversation.&rdquo;
He continues, &ldquo;This plants the seeds of a whole new generation of
enterprise, mobile and embedded application possibilities. We use
the term &ldquo;Connected Messaging&rdquo; to label the way Jabber becomes
connected to customer service, business exchange connections,
device-based applications&mdash;or whatever. Jabber opens up all kinds
of possibilities for Net-based conversations between companies and
their customers, business partners and mobile employees. Plus the
entire world of connected devices with a reason to traffic in live
messages.''</p><p>For Linux developers, this opens the world in two directions:
1) Linux now operates in, and drives, virtually any kind of device;
and 2) protocol-free and dynamic relationships can be created and
improved on a constant basis. Of course there are enormous
directory and security issues left to solve, and those are just two
of the most obvious issues. But now they begin to appear much more
solvable.</p><p>Craig Burton, the network guru who guided Novell to success
in the Eighties and did the same for The Burton Group in the
Nineties, sees XML as a development as significant to our time as
calculus was to the Renaissance; where calculus gave us a dynamic
mathematical model, he says, XML gives us a dynamic protocol
framework&mdash;one that allows us to circumvent protocol bottlenecks by
making communication independent of them. He explains, &ldquo;XML
provides the framework for discovering accessibility&mdash;or a
protocol&mdash;to a service during initialization. Because XML exists,
developers can design communications independently of static
protocols. With a dynamic protocol framework, independent&mdash;or
discrete&mdash;services can exist and innovate at their own pace without
the limitations and boundaries of a fixed protocol. The freedom
that a dynamic protocol framework will give to innovation and
implementation of Internet infrastructure will have an immeasurable
impact on the future of network computing, as we know it.&rdquo;</p><p>Craig's idea of XML as a protocol framework makes IM a
potentially critical Internet service for every logical entity with
a reason to exchange messages of any kind in &ldquo;real-enough&rdquo; time,
rather than just for a few million people chatting with their
buddies.</p><p>Since Linux is in an ideal position to become the universal
OS on which &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; IM will run, let's take a closer look at
where this new industry is headed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eec580.0x1fdca18"></a>Apply Anything</h2></div></div><p>Real Time and Linux have been acquainted for a long time. RT
tasks have been implemented as kernel modules in the manner of
device drivers. In the practical sense, RT tasks can be developed
and implemented in Linux user space where they cannot overwrite
critical areas of kernel memory.</p><p>But for real-time precision with minimal interrupt latency,
more dedicated solutions need to be found. Victor Yodaiken and
Michael Brabanov's approach was embodied in RT-Linux, which was
first released in February 1996. They didn't think working along
Linux's POSIX lines would deliver that. So they created an
emulation layer that insulates the upper layers of the OS from
interrupts, intercepting those interrupts on behalf of the
OS.</p><p>In this scheme, when Linux thinks it turns an interrupt off,
it sets a flag in the emulation layer. While interrupts stay on,
the emulation layer intercepts the interrupts that occur while
Linux believes it is uninterruptible. Intercepted interrupts are
queued, so no interrupts are lost. But the real-time work is done
by a deterministic adjunct real-time kernel. This division of labor
essentially creates a real-time Linux OS&mdash;except it's not really
Linux where the rubber meets the road.</p><p>More recently, another version of that approach has emerged.
RTAI (Real-Time Application Interface) also has a separate
real-time module that operates below the Linux kernel. Lineo is a
prime developer for RTAI, and has contributed a significant portion
of the RTAI code base. &ldquo;Although we provide support for our
customers who choose RTLinux, we recommend RTAI because we believe
that it has a cleaner design, equivalent performance, and includes
enhanced features, such as the ability to deploy a hard real-time
application from standard user space &rdquo;, says Lineo's David Beal,
Product Manager for Real-Time Technology. He adds:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The advantage of hard real-time over the soft
real-time approaches is that when you implement a hard real-time
task, you can effectively remain unconcerned with all of the
computer's internal and external events. RTAI provides task
guarantees because these external are serviced with a lower
priority than the real-time task, thus they can not disrupt the
critical task's timing. In a world where embedded devices are
becoming increasingly network-connected and multi-tasking, this is
a luxury that none of the soft real-time approaches can promise.
</p><p>RTAI features are modular and need only be added as they are
required. Minimal real-time scheduling services take up 65 Kbytes
of additional code space but if you add everything in, you get to
about 300 Kbytes.</p></blockquote></div><p>That's just one approach, but it's the one that speaks
directly to the inadequacies of Linux in the real-time world.
Here's IDC analyst Dan Kusnetzky's overview of the embedded Linux
market as it now stands:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Many organizations are working to find ways to
use Linux as an embedded operating environment. Red Hat and Lineo
are only the most recognizable names working on this. Some are
interested in providing Linux for Internet appliances. Some are
focusing on server appliances. A few are focusing on Linux as a
real-time operating environment. The last is quite a trick because
the Linux kernel doesn't have the features for the most intensive
real-time applications.
</p><p>Some focused on real-time Linux have developed their own
real-time kernel to replace the Linux kernel. Others have Linux
boot up their own proprietary real-time environment. Although the
run time environment isn't Linux, they can talk about real time and
Linux in the same sentence because Linux is what people see when it
boots up.</p><p>IDC is expecting the Linux community to settle on standard
approaches to support both embedded and real-time applications.
Until then, we have a number of competing offerings from different
suppliers.</p></blockquote></div><p>The competition is heating up fast. James Ready, the embedded
pioneer who founded Ready Systems a few years back, now runs
MontaVista,
<a href="http://www.mvista.com" target="_self">http://www.mvista.com/</a>,
which launched HardHat Linux last year. Red Hat acquired Cygnus
last Fall, then added WireSpeed in June of this year. (The sidebar
is by Michael Tiemann, the Red Hat CTO who founded Cygnus.) Last
summer, Caldera, an early Linux distribution leader, spun off Lineo
as an embedded Linux company. Both Lineo and MontaVista have
substantial venture capital backing and are themselves in
aggressive acquisition modes. With all this movement in a short
time, traditional embedded publications and events are suddenly
abuzz with Linux coverage.</p><p>However, the traditional RTOS isn't going away quickly. Wind
River (which makes both VxWorks and pSOS) is the market leader,
with around $200 million in sales and a multi-billion-dollar market
cap. &ldquo;Wind River is the 2000-pound gorilla in the embedded OS
market,&rdquo; says Bryan Sparks, President &amp; CEO of Lineo. &ldquo;But
we're finding a lot of interest in moving away from Wind River
products. If we can support the same platforms that Wind River
does, we can take more and more business away from them,&rdquo; he
explains. In addition to Intel, AMD, PowerPC and other usual
suspects, microprocessor platforms include Hitachi SH, MIPS, ARM
and StrongArm, ndcore, ColdFire, Dragonball and others. &ldquo;We can
get Linux on all those platforms,&rdquo; Sparks adds.</p><p>Some of those platforms are very small micro-controllers that
don't have full-featured CPU sets. Typically they lack an MMU
(Memory Management Unit). So Linux needs to be modified
accodingly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eec580.0x1fdd048"></a>Why Embedded Linux?</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A happy consequence of the Open Source model is
that Linux evolved, by necessity, to be more modular and to support
cleaner interfaces than a monolithic design that assumes less
anarchistic control. As a result, Linux kernels as small as 300KB
can not only boot up with networking support but serve web pages as
well. This is really exciting to people who want to put web servers
(and administrative consoles) <span   class="emphasis"><em>everywhere</em></span>.
</p><p>You can also use the same APIs for development and
deployment. While this is not a new goal, we now have a system that
(1) works, (2) people actually like to program and (3) supports
tons of content. This has expanded the realm of embedded system
development from a highly specialized art to something any Linux
programmer can manage. This is going to have a profound impact on
the embedded system market.</p></blockquote></div><p>&mdash;Michael Tiemann, Chief Technology Officer, Red Hat</p><p>The move to Linux is happening most rapidly around mobile
systems. Intel is seeing strong Linux support for StrongARM. Compaq
has created the Open Handheld Program and released a Linux version
for its iPAQ handheld PC. The company also sponsors Handhelds.org,
which supports open-source software development for handheld
devices. Given Linux's popularity as a hermit crab on x86 boxes,
Windows CE handheld devices are an obvious embedded Linux target.
While Palm charges more for a software license (around $20/unit)
than Microsoft charges for Windows CE (around $10-$15/unit), Palm's
units are more arcane and less powerful than typical Windows CE
devices, so moving Linux to the latter is a shorter step. This
reportedly is HP's approach. Boris Elisman, worldwide marketing
manager at HP's information appliances and services division, says
the company is developing a number of multifunction Linux devices
that should come out in 2001.</p><p>Designing embedded systems around Linux is an extremely easy
choice for OEMs to make. John Bork of Intel, which is building its
new set-top boxes and Dot.Station web appliances on a combination
of embedded Linux and customized Mozilla explains, &ldquo;We just take
the source off the Net, pull out the stuff we don't need, seeing
what libraries are used and not used, and constraining ourselves
from there. See, the biggest challenge we face is getting the OS,
the browser, the plug-ins and a few applets into eight megabytes of
flash. So a lot of our work has gone into analyzing what pieces we
need and how we skinny this thing down.&rdquo;</p><p>This work has a lot of appeal. &ldquo;I enjoyed working on servers
at my last job,&rdquo; says one Linux programmer at Kerbango, a startup
using embedded Linux in its web radios, &ldquo;but I love working on
cool new stuff here.&rdquo; In the past, learning a whole new operating
system and all its tools was expensive and time-consuming. Not so
with Linux. An embedded application might be extremely arcane, but
the operating system knowledge required is not, because Linux and
its tools are so familiar to so many developers. This fact can hold
down NRE (non-recoverable engineering) costs, which are always
critical factors.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4195f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Intel's Dot.Station
</p></div></div><p>Kerbango's radio and Intel's Dot.Station are just two among
the first wave of Net-native appliances built using embedded Linux
(the Dot.Station also uses Mozilla).</p><p>&ldquo;Skinnying down&rdquo; Linux, however, is not an easy job. That's
why companies like Lineo and MontaVista are in business. Here's Kim
Clark, VP Engineering at Lineo is familiar with these issues and
says, &ldquo;The first thing you need to understand is, what are all the
packages? Which ones do I need and which ones don't I need? What
are the dependencies associated with each of them? Choosing one
package may require choosing two or three other packages. But they
also might conflict with packages from another module. So you have
this hairy and complicated task of figuring out all the things that
need to be there.</p><p>Among Lineo's tools is one called &ldquo;LIPO,&rdquo; which goes in
and, well, sucks out all the fat. &ldquo;The shared libraries are big
and fat,&rdquo; Clark says. &ldquo;If you have several modules sharing
libraries, each with a copy of that library, you've got a bigger
footprint. We cut fat out of that. We also reduce the size of each
library's footprint. We do the same for Apache. By cutting out icon
support, for example, you save 22k of memory. We make this possible
by taking Apache, cutting it into microcomponents, giving
developers the choice of using only the parts they need.&rdquo; (See
Figures 3 and 4.)</p><p>

None of the lines are definitive, which is why the boxes are
shaded.</p><p>Lyle Ball, VP Marketing for Lineo, says, &ldquo;The important
thing is that, while the desktop and server areas are familiar
territory, the rest of the world&mdash;the embedded device world&mdash;is
not. There is a lot of existing expertise everywhere on this chart,
but when you get down to the finished product level, that's where

Net's popularity is the growing expectation that just about
everything will eventually be connected to it and communications
over it will be instantaneous. This is the real world meaning of
&ldquo;real-time.&rdquo; In a fully distributed computing world, any device
should be able to communicate with any other device in
real-time&mdash;or close enough. What's the infrastructure for
that?</p><p>The Jabber People think it's XML-based Instant Messaging. IM
by itself is about two functions: presence and messaging. The first
involves detecting and revealing the availability of another
identity on the network. The second involves one-to-one (or
one-to-few) live text exchanges with one or more present members of
a list.</p><p>In enterprises where IM is widely adopted, life isn't the
same for other technologies. &ldquo;It changes the sociology of
telephony,&rdquo; says Udi Shapiro, an instant messaging pioneer whose
company, Ubique, created an IM system that was owned for awhile by
AOL before Udi and his partners bought it back and sold it to
Lotus, which now offers it as SameTime. According to Udi, IM in
corporate settings becomes an accessory to the telephone, replacing
brief or trivial calls in some cases and initiating them in others.
The next step would naturally be to meld IM and telephony
technologies: in wired telephone systems; in Voice over IP (VoIP);
in wireless communications between handheld devices; and in
combinations of all those, plus web, e-mail and other Net-native
communications.</p><p>It's not hard to imagine what IM can do for communications
between humans. The harder but necessary step is to imagine
communications between humans and remote machines, and among
machines themselves, on an ad hoc, real-time basis. This is where
embedded Linux comes in.</p><p>When IM is combined with Embedded Linux, IM provides the
framework for registration and lookup, while embedded Linux works
as the device driver in the API. Through the instant messenger, the
client says to the server &ldquo;I'm on-line,&rdquo; and the server notifies
other clients of that fact, providing the path for direct
communications. Thus, instant messaging becomes an ideal way to set
up point-to-point communications between two unknown
entities&mdash;human or otherwise.</p><p>With Jabber, XML messages become an &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; or container
(see Figure 6). The contents of that envelope are infinitely
flexible. XML's data is &ldquo;structured&rdquo;, but also potentially
dynamic&mdash;able to change constantly. It can even define the terms by
which it is understood.</p><p>

Messaging: XML as a Container</p></div></div>
</p><p>XML is designed to carry &ldquo;structured&rdquo; data. But that data
can change constantly and&mdash;by design&mdash;define the terms by which it
is understood. In essence, this creates a standards-based framework
for dynamic relationships between communicating entities on the
Net. When those communications become &ldquo;instant&rdquo;, there is nothing
to stop relationships from being defined and changed whenever
necessary.</p><p>When communications become &ldquo;instant&rdquo; (which in practical
terms means near real-time), there is nothing to stop relationships
from being defined and changed whenever necessary by agreement
between the communicating parties, even if those parties are
intelligent devices. With Jabber, any two identities, whether human
or machine, can send and receive real-time messages that contain
pretty much anything, and do so in a structured way, independent,
if necessary, of intermediating protocols.</p><p>Although Jabber was originally envisioned as a distributed,
XML aware instant messaging platform, its uncomplicated methods of
combining presence with XML document routing puts it in an ideal
position to become much more than just another instant messaging
system. Instead, it could become infrastructure for messaging
enabled, embedded applications. It becomes the way they communicate
through the Net&mdash;whether with each other or with applications on
the PC (which are already talking to each other).</p><p>Figure 7 shows a Jabber client/server platform built for the
purpose of routing XML data in real time. Note that the underlying
messaging infrastructure and protocol is XML and not a proprietary
messaging protocol. Messages can be sent from device-to-device,
device-to-PC, or translated from any of the above to other networks
and protocols. The dynamic, self-determining nature of XML makes
this infrastructure dynamic: in other words, to accommodate
constantly changing relationships between logical entities on the
Net.</p><p>

</p><p>Jabber is an instant messaging platform with the ability to
packetize messages in XML documents&mdash;in effect as data transport.
Any PC or Net-native device can instantly communicate with all of
the infrastructure on the Internet that can parse and act on XML.
This puts new XML databases&mdash;which are designed to parse XML and
store structured data or documents&mdash;in a powerful context. Anywhere
XML is the preferred way to receive and send information, we have
infrastructure already conformed to instant messaging.</p><p><a href="4195s1.html" target="_self">Jeremie's Big Picture</a></p><p>In this sense, Jabber is a ubiquitous XML router, streamlined
for (and by) embedded Linux, or any other device-driving OS that
supports XML-based messaging. Real (enough) time is the key. While
e-mail is technically capable of routing XML documents, it lacks
awareness of presence, which is key to Instant Messaging in
general. This makes Jabber something of a new message transport
breed.</p><p>This breed will expand Internet infrastructure to accommodate
a vast new range of dynamic real-time relationships and activities,
routed through XML. This invites the development of suites of
robust client-side libraries on multiple OSs, gathering around
embedded Linux. These will constitute an SDK for connected
messaging to the device world.</p><p>

</p><p>an XML Data Stream
</p><p>This shows how new and emerging tools (like XML optimized
databases) can make use of (and be used by) XML communications
streams between devices, and how they can provide new services. The
fact that all communication with Jabber is via XML documents means
that all new XML tools and services can be easily &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; into
the message stream carried by Jabber.</p><p>&ldquo;Emerging tools (like XML optimized databases&mdash;see Figure 8)
can be used to leverage XML communications streams and to provide
whole new services,&rdquo; says Andre Durand, General Manager of Jabber,
Inc.,
<a href="http://www.jabber.com" target="_self">http://www.jabber.com/</a>,
the organization formed to help commercialize Jabber in ways that
leverage and reward its open-source development (and developers).
He continues, &ldquo;The fact that all communication with Jabber is via
XML documents means that emerging XML tools and services can be
easily &ldquo;plugged&rdquo; into the message stream carried by Jabber.
Extrapolate that, and you've got a device driving framework for the
known world. Because it is now quite simple for you, or a
contractor you hire, to program your home&mdash;say through X10, which
was designed for that purpose&mdash;you can operate, and receive
notification about, all the home electronic conveniences you
already have: your security system, your lighting, your sprinklers.
You can also program those devices to tell you if they're on,
functioning and ready to receive instructions. So the concept of
presence applies in more than one direction. Two way conversation
that includes presence is Jabber infrastructure on a common XML
framework.''</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eec580.0x22f2320"></a>Big Bang 2.0</h2></div></div><p>What Jabber does with IM, XML and embedded Linux adds huge
