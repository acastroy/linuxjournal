    I want a search engine to grep the world for me.

any drop to drink. --Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em></span>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4174f1.jpg"></div>
 If information were water and search engines were taps, I'd chug
about ten gallons a day. I don't just want it. I need it. Name a
verb expression for appetite, put it between I and information, and
you start to see where I'm coming from.</p><p>Most of the information I crave is specific and textual; and
since most specific text information involves more than one word in
a row, I'm usually looking for alphanumeric strings. Sometimes, but
not always, those strings are words.</p><p>In other words, I want a search engine to grep the world for
me.</p><p>Since I'm sure this is no-hope-in-hell territory, I just went
looking for a quote to express my frustration. I found it through
Google. It's from the prolific Dmitry Kirsanov, writing in the
&ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; chapters of <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML Unleashed, Professional
Reference Edition</em></span>, the full text of which is exposed
online at
<a href="http://www.webreference.com/dlab/books/html-pre" target="_self">http://www.webreference.com/dlab/books/html-pre/</a>.
He writes, &ldquo;Those accustomed to grep-style regular expressions
can't even dream of using something similar with search
engines.&rdquo;</p><p>We won't go into why. But we do have to ask if it's necessary
for so many engines to be as bad as they are about this. It seems
like every time I find a search engine that does The Job, somebody
buys it and it goes to hell. Or it goes to hell and then somebody
buys it. Whatever order, the bad news is always around the corner.
And, without fail, it comes in the form of (here comes that dreaded
word)...marketing.</p><p>Marketing can't seem to help trading utility for &ldquo;reach&rdquo;,
''exposure'', &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; or some other ''strategic'' abstraction
intended to influence the largest possible population&mdash;ignoring the
fact that today's common denominators aren't as low and wide as
they used to be. Especially on the web.</p><p>The uncommon denominators (that's us again) are rather
abundant, too. And it's not like marketing lives to ignore the
connoisseur. Witness wars among automobile makers over handling
characteristics only mechanics and race car drivers can fully
understand. (How many of us careen our Chevy Tahoes down black
diamond slopes or floor our Acuras to tire-melting speeds on 2-lane
Nevada backroads?)</p><p>But dot-com marketing is a wacky breed that often lusts after
consumers to a degree not seen outside Procter &amp; Gamble, circa
1958. It was consumer-hungry marketing that killed Lycos (the
original one that came from Carnegie Melon), then Infoseek, then
Hotbot (as Inktomi created it), then Altavista (as DEC created it).
Each of those was born to serve intellectual curiosity.
Others&mdash;Looksmart, AskJeeves, Go, Yahoo! and DirectHit, to name a
few&mdash;were born good for little other than flat-ass-dumb
&ldquo;consumer&rdquo; searches for &ldquo;favorites&rdquo;, &ldquo;portals&rdquo; and
whatnot.</p><p>Okay, I'll make an exception for Yahoo!, which has always
used human beings to catalog the Web. And now it hired Google to do
the heavy lifting, which is a good thing. We'll say more about
Google after the Altavista autopsy.</p><p>I knew Altavista was terminal last fall, when its
&ldquo;advanced&rdquo; search page was suddenly replaced by bragging about
&ldquo;improvements&rdquo;. &ldquo;Tips&rdquo; were gone. So was a nice and easy way to
search for inbound links to a given URL. If the function persisted,
no clues to procedures remained (at least that I could find) amidst
the fresh marketing poop.</p><p>Of course, there was a survey. So I filled it out. This came
back by e-mail:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Thank you very much for recently filling out the
survey on the AltaVista Advanced Search page. Your suggestions and
comments will help us continue to make AltaVista Advanced Search
the best way to location [sic] information on the Internet.
</p><p>We've found that once users try Advanced Search, they realize
the power of the tools that AltaVista has to make your searching
more precise. So, we're always trying to come up with new ways to
encourage regular searchers to try out Advanced Search. And, that's
where we'd like your opinions.</p><p>As you'll recall, along with your survey responses you also
submitted this email address. So if we had any follow-up questions
we could contact you again. Well now we'd like your opinions about
some promotions we'd like to use to convince users to give Advanced
Search a try.</p><p>The six-question survey should take only a couple of minutes.
Simply click on the hyperlink below. If you are using AOL or
another email service that does not support hyperlinks, please copy
the hyperlink and paste it into your browser window in the Address
box.</p></blockquote></div><p>The URL delivered me to a silly world whose gods believe that
prizes might do what features won't. I wrote this in the Input
box:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I don't want a prize. If your search is so damned
&ldquo;advanced&rdquo; (and how can it be, now that you fail to even mention
the wonderful &ldquo;link:www.mysite.com -url:mysite.com&rdquo; feature that
only works in BASIC, fercrissake!), I'd be glad to help out for
FREE. I'll give you my time if you'll give me your attention. I
want truly advanced search functions. THAT's what tempts me. Not
prizes.</p></blockquote></div><p>At the bottom of page two, the system broke down and wouldn't
advance me to page three. I gave up and didn't go back except to
see how it compared with competition.
</p><p>But hey, maybe they listened. The &ldquo;cheat sheet&rdquo; at
<a href="http://doc.altavista.com/adv_search/syntax.shtml" target="_self">doc.altavista.com/adv_search/syntax.shtml</a>
restores a lot of the good advice lost from the original Advanced
page. But the sad fact is that Altavista isn't as good as it used
to be. FAST, Google and even MSN Search yield better results. If
you're looking for strings. (For more, see the feature in
UpFront.)</p><p>I know because I test search engines pretty often. I go deep
into a document somewhere in my own domain,
<a href="http://www.searls.com" target="_self">http://www.searls.com/</a>,
and grab a string of text that appears both in my own site and in a
number of others, such as a quote from literature. Then, I run a
bunch of engines through the mill. That's how I knew when Altavista
started to beat Infoseek, when Hotbot began to beat Altavista and
when FAST began to beat Hotbot.</p><p>The last time I saved results was December 3, 1999. At that
time, FAST,
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com" target="_self">http://www.alltheweb.com/</a>,
won. They still win (see UpFront) on some tests but lose on
others&mdash;usually to Google.</p><p>There's an awful lot to like about Google. First, they run
their engine on Linux (in case you're asking, Google is a huge Red
Hat customer). Second, their user interface is blessedly simple and
devoid of hype for anything other than itself, and there's precious
little of that. Design-wise, they make great use of white space.
Third, they have nicely incorporated the DMOZ Open Directory
project's catalog, which is essentially The People's Yahoo!. But
fourth (and most importantly), they have done more than any other
search company to allow trusting searches of both strings and
collections of words at the same time.</p><p>Where FAST and Hotbot give you a pop-out menu choice of &ldquo;the
phrase&rdquo;, &ldquo;all the words&rdquo; and &ldquo;any of the words&rdquo; (or the
equivalents), Google does all of those at once, defaulting first to
phrase mode. You can use quotes to narrow the results, but the
difference is usually small. That means Google has done a good job
of providing the largest possible narrow search. In fact, the one
site users want comes out on top so often that Google confidently
provides an &ldquo;I'm Feeling Lucky&rdquo; button that yields just one
result.</p><p>Google does have special search functions, all
well-explained. I wish they had more, but I can live without them.
Google is, for me, by far the most useful and reliable search
engine&mdash;at least for those hard-to-find word strings.</p><p>What's not to like about Google? Well, there's the Patent
Issue. They're going after patents on their search methods (and who
knows what else), which costs them good will in the Linux/Open
Source community. At an event early this year, I talked briefly
about patents with Google's co-founder, Larry Page. It was clear
that Larry isn't crazy about them. Immediately afterwards, I talked
with John Doerr. It was equally clear that John is crazy about
patents&mdash;to the degree that he believes that patents are one of the
things that &ldquo;make America great.&rdquo; John, of course, is a VC with
Kleiner Perkins, which conspicuously funds Google.</p><p>There's also the risk that Google will pursue an
advertising-driven business strategy. In current searches, ads show
up as annotated, text-only links, posted above search results.
These are certainly far less onerous than banners (also harder to
block). But they quietly crept in a few months ago. What's the next
step?</p><p>I don't know. In fact, I just tried to force Google's engine
to give me an ad, and it wouldn't do it&mdash;not once in ten tries. So
I suspect that the company is being cautious. As it should. Far as
I know, Google is the only search engine created by and for people
who live to search and search to live.</p><p>We need more of those. And we need the ones we've got to
remember why we like them so much.</p></div></div>
