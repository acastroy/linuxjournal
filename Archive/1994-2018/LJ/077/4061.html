    In outer space, on the ground, and in the classroom:
    some exciting real-world applications developed with Linux
    by students and researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1a73660"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Linux operating system (OS) coupled
with powerful and efficient available software development tools,
has been the platform of choice for several research and commercial
projects at the University of Colorado located in Boulder. The
projects include several payloads that have flown seventeen sortie
missions on the NASA Space Shuttle. The payloads were built by
BioServe Space Technologies, which is a NASA Center for the
Commercialization of Space (CSC), and is associated with the
Aerospace Department within the College of Engineering. BioServe's
payloads have logged over a full year of combined operation in
micro-gravity, including two extended stays on the Russian Space
Station Mir. Student projects include an unmanned ground vehicle
(UGV), which navigates autonomously based upon its assessment of
dynamic environmental conditions.
</p><p>Linux has proven to be an invaluable teaching instrument from
a pedagogical standpoint at our university. Several classes are
taught in the Aerospace Engineering Sciences and Computer Science
departments that take advantage of the sophisticated and robust
features of the Linux OS, not only as a development platform but as
a method to teach and <span   class="emphasis"><em>implement</em></span> advanced
topics in hardware/software integration, control theory, operating
systems research and systems administration. This article details
several of the projects from a scientific and engineering
perspective and provides an overview of common software
methodologies used in the development of the complex control
schemes necessary for reliable and robust operation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1a73818"></a>Linux in Outer Space</h2></div></div><p>BioServe Space Technologies has built and flown several
payloads that use the Linux operating system to interface with the
control hardware, provide support for operator input and output
devices, and provide the software development environment. The
workhorse of the BioServe payload fleet is the Commercial Generic
Bioprocessing Apparatus, CGBA, shown in its version 1 configuration
in Figure 1. The operator data entry and visual feedback devices
are located on the front panel. The keypad and mini-VGA screen are
attached to an embedded control computer running Linux. The CGBA
payload operates as an Isothermal Containment Module (ICM) with the
capability to precisely control chamber temperature from 4 to 40
degrees C. Inside are the biological and crystal growth experiments
loaded before launch. CGBA is a &ldquo;single locker&rdquo; payload
(approximately 21"x17"x10") for insertion into either the Shuttle
mid-deck or into large payload modules that fly in the Shuttle
cargo bay.</p><p>The Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA) shown in Figure 2 is the
fundamental experimental unit of the CGBA payload. It is
essentially a &ldquo;micro-gravity test tube&rdquo; which allows controlled,
sequential on-orbit mixing of 2 or 3 fluids. The fluids are
contained inside a glass barrel with an internal diameter of
13.5mm. Up to eight of the FPAs are loaded into a motorized Group
Activation Pack (GAP), shown in Figure 3. Control software
initiates the mixing of liquids containing different cell culture
mediums at specified times once the payload has attained
micro-gravity. A second motor initiation, which depresses a plunger
in a manner similar to a syringe, combines the cell culture mixture
with a fixative reagent, which squelches further biological
reaction. The flight samples are then analyzed in comparison with
identical samples in ground-based experiments to determine the
effects of micro-gravity upon fundamental biological processes.
Pharmaceutical and crystallization investigations are common
candidates for these types of experiments; a small increase in the
efficiency of a reaction can lead to a significant increase in the
desired products, and thus to a company's profit margin.</p><p>

</p><p>A second version of the CGBA payload highlights a
configurable internal palette, upon which several different habitat
chambers can be built. This payload contains multiple video cameras
to provide time-sequenced image recording of the habitat contents.
BioServe has used this payload configuration, in conjunction with
SpaceHab, Inc., to provide exciting space-based educational
outreach to primary and secondary school students across the world.
SpaceHab's Space Technology and Research for Students (S*T*A*R*S)
program supports a wide array of potential experiments for
investigation.</p><p>In July of 1999, two experiments flown in the payload onboard
Shuttle mission STS-93 involved students from high schools in the
United States and students from a secondary school in Chile. As
shown in Figure 4, this payload had three center habitats which
contained ladybugs and aphids while the larger chamber in the front
left housed butterflies. The first experiment, of interest to
students in the U.S., involved the incubation and development of
pupae larvae from a crystalith (cocoon) to the maturation stage of
a butterfly. The second experiment, designed entirely by a group of
teenage girls in Chile, investigated the effects of micro-gravity
upon the predatory relationship of ladybugs and their favorite
prey, the aphid, which is notorious for its devastation of food
crops. Figure 5 shows aphids, the small black objects on immature
wheat plants before the introduction of predatory ladybugs into the
habitat chamber. The same habitat after the release of the ladybugs
is pictured in Figure 6, showing a (expected) decrease in aphid
population. Note the ladybug in the middle right of the image as it
attempts to catch an aphid in microgravity. The results of this
experiment hope to gage the potential for using natural
predator/prey relationships as a means to minimize detrimental
insect destruction of both terrestrial and space-based food
crops.</p><p>

</p><p>The second S*T*A*R*S flight, to be flown aboard Shuttle
flight STS-107 in 2001, will support an international array of
educational science experiments. Participation in this program is
literally worldwide. The educational departments of numerous
countries submitted proposals for selection, from which six
experiments have been chosen. Australia will fly an AstroSpider
experiment, which is a collaboration between Glen Waverely
Secondary College and researchers from the Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology. They will investigate how the mechanical
properties of the spider's silk, which can be 100 times stronger
than steel, differ when it is produced in microgravity. Jingshan
High School in China has proposed an experiment which will
investigate one of their country's icons, the silkworm. Their
experiment will attempt to reveal the effects of microgravity on
silk production and the metamorphosis process as the silkworms
transform from worm-like larvae, spin cocoons and then emerge as
adults. Two of the new S*T*A*R*S experiments will be a joint effort
involving investigators in Japan and the United States. Both groups
will each fly an enclosed, aquatic ecosystem that contains plants
and tiny aquatic animals. They hope to investigate the navigation
and locomotive processes of these animals as they swim in
microgravity. Israeli science students from Motzkin Ort Junior High
School are designing their experiment to investigate the formation
of crystals in microgravity. They hope to see differences in the
shape, structure, strength and size of space grown crystals over
similarly grown, earth-based crystals. The final participant in
this flight is Fowler High School from Syracuse, New York. In
conjunction with Syracuse University, they are designing a zero
gravity ant farm. They hope to chart differences in the species'
well-characterized social activities brought on by the
disorientation of space flight. Recently, a third S*T*A*R*S mission
has been scheduled for the year 2002 onboard the International
Space Station, which will allow longer-term scientific
investigations to be conducted.</p><p>The CGBA payload, in its version 3 configuration (see Figure
7), allows for individual temperature control of each GAP container
by coupling it to a heat sink (water loop) with thermoelectric
modules and insulating each GAP from one another. The water loop is
distributed on the top and bottom of this locker to virtually
eliminate thermal gradients and to provide efficient temperature
control of the individual sample container. These individual
temperature controlled containers allow for time sequenced
experiment initiation and termination. The National Institute of
Health will fly an experiment investigating the development of
fruit fly maturation, from larvae to adults, using this
configuration. The fruit fly maturation process can be effectively
controlled by warming Petri dishes contained in the individually
temperature controlled GAPs at different times using pre-programmed
temperature profiles. The fruit fly has a scientifically
well-documented development process. Scientists have been able to
genetically splice fruit fly neurons with fluorescent markers and
are interested in the development of neural based muscular
activity. The research is aimed at investigating the difference in
neural pathway development between space-based samples as compared
to similar ground-based control samples. The scientific goal is an
increased understanding of how gravity affects neural
development.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4061f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. CGBA-03 Payload with Temperature
Controlled Containers</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Plant Generic BioProcessing Apparatus (PGBA) (see Figures
8 and 9) is twice the volume of the &ldquo;single locker&rdquo; CGBA payloads
described previously. It is designed to precisely control the
environmental conditions of temperature, humidity and oxygen/carbon
dioxide levels within the plant growth chamber for fundamental
space-based research in the plant sciences arena. Plant science is
fundamental for many large commercial entities including the
pharmaceutical and timber industries. Both of these commercially
important industries are, in part, based upon plant-produced
compounds. For example, the timber industry funds significant
research programs investigating the production of lignum which is
responsible for providing structural strength for both plants and
trees. From a commercial perspective, lignum is undesirable for the
formation of paper products but a desirable constituent for strong
timber products. In micro-gravity, a plant's need for structural
strength is greatly diminished. Current research focuses upon the
change in lignum production in micro-gravity based plants and trees
to determine potential methods for regulating the compound's
terrestrial in situ production.</p><p>

PGBA</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Fluid Generic Bio-Processing Apparatus (FGBA) (see Figure
10) is interesting from both the research and commercial
perspectives. FGBA was developed in conjunction with the Coca-Cola
Company and was flown onboard STS-77 in 1996. FGBA was used to
provide basic research about human taste perception, which changes
in micro-gravity. The payload also investigated fundamental
relationships pertaining to two-phase fluid flow and dispensing in
microgravity, as the beverages were mixed and dispensed using
pressurized carbon dioxide in a manner similar to earth-based soda
fountains. From the commercial perspective, this payload
demonstrated the potential for the funding of space-borne projects
based not only upon their fundamental research potential, but also
on their capability to bring commercial advertising dollars to the
cash-strapped International Space Station.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4061f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 10. (FGBA) Developed with the Coca-Cola
Company</p></div></div>
</p><p>In all of the payloads, an accelerometer-based system is used
to detect launch, thus allowing experiment initiation
(motor-activation, temperature change, lighting conditions)
immediately upon entering orbit. Additionally, automatic experiment
termination can be programmed to occur at any time during the
mission, including just prior to reentry, based on pre-planned (or
updated) Shuttle end-of-mission time. These two capabilities
combined allow an early-as-possible experiment initiation and a
late-as-possible termination, since those are periods when
astronaut crew availability for payload tasks is typically at a
minimum.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1e6d2d0"></a>Design Issues</h2></div></div><p>Linux was chosen as the operating system for the payloads
onboard the Shuttle (and soon to be International Space Station)
missions for several reasons. First and foremost is its high
reliability. In several years of developing different payloads, we
have never encountered a problem that was operating system related.
Other reasons for use of the Linux OS include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ease of custom kernel configuration, which enables
a small kernel footprint optimized for the task at hand;</p></li><li><p>The ability to write kernel-space custom device
drivers for interfacing to required peripheral hardware such as
analog and digital I/O boards or framegrabbers;</p></li><li><p>The ability to optimize the required application
packages resident on payload non-volatile storage media;</p></li><li><p>The availability of a powerful software development
environment;</p></li><li><p>Availability of the standard UNIX-like conventions
of interprocess communication (IPC) methodologies, shell scripting
and multi-threaded control processes.</p></li></ul></div><p>With the recent advances and capabilities of real-time
variants of the Linux OS, critical real-time process scheduling is
available (if needed) for incorporation into the software/hardware
control architecture.
</p><p>Because of the limited volume of these complex payloads, it
is necessary to minimize the volume of every hardware item,
including the communications and process control computer. In our
payloads, we use a combination of small single board computers
(SBC) and PC-104 form factor boards to supplement the capability of
the SBC. In particular, we have had great success and outstanding
reliability from Ampro, Diamond Systems, SanDisk and Ajeco
products.</p><p>The computer hardware architecture we have designed and
developed is generic in that the same architecture is used for all
of the different payloads. The single board computer provides the
CPU, FPU, video interfaces, IDE and SCSI device interfaces, along
with the serial and Ethernet communications interfaces (see Figures
11 and 12).</p><p>The inside of the control computer assembly, with a single
board computer and stack-on PC-104 module, is pictured in Figure
11. The unit is 6 feet wide and 2.5 feet deep. Figure 12 shows the
outside front of the control computer assembly with the keypad and
mini-VGA attached. Analog and digital IO capabilities, necessary
for interfacing to control hardware and sensors, are implemented
via an additional PC-104 module. Imaging of the experiments within
the payloads is accomplished via multiple cameras interfaced to a
PC-104 frame-grabber. This generic hardware architecture allows for
the integration of a complex array of sensors and control
actuators. Additionally, distributed processing is implemented by
attaching micro-controllers over a serial RS485 multi-drop
communications bus, which facilitates the addition of new control
hardware in a modular manner.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4061f11.large.jpg"><img src="4061f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 11. Inside of the Control Computer
Assembly</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4061f12.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 12. Keypad and Mini-VGA
Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>One tremendous advantage provided by the true
multi-processing Linux environment is the relative ease of software
development as compared to monolithic DOS systems. A similar
generic, multi-threaded software control architecture is used for
process control and communications for all of the projects
described in this article and shown in Figure 13.</p><p>The software architecture follows the multi-threaded peer
model. At start-up, the thread responsible for initialization of
the entire system first spawns the processes required for
payload-to-groundside communications. Next, shared resources are
requested and initialized. Communication and synchronization
control variables are initialized, and then a separate thread is
created corresponding to the different services required from the
payload. For our payloads, these services are categorized as either
primary or secondary services. Primary services include those tasks
which are required for the fundamental control of the payloads.
Primary services for the different payloads tend to be identical in
functionality, but the methods of hardware implementation can
differ greatly. Secondary services are those specific to a
particular payload.</p><p>From the development standpoint, the use of threads in a
proven multi-process architecture facilitates multi-programmer
development, module reuse and a much faster test-and-debug cycle,
since processing of individual threads is easily enabled or
disabled. This allows for complete testing of a single subsystem,
say the chamber temperature control, in a stand-alone manner. Once
completely tested, the subsystem is incorporated into the overall
payload control architecture, thus minimizing adverse effects of
integration.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4061f13.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 13. Simple Chart of Software
Architecture.</p></div></div>
</p><p>The communications system is implemented in a modular manner
as well. Data transmission is abstracted at the programming
interface level as different messages (e.g., analog data, health
and status messages, images, etc.). These different length messages
are termed &ldquo;channels&rdquo;. A thread that wishes to transmit a message
to ground stations, queues (writes) a dynamic message of
pre-defined length to a specified channel (see Figure 14). The
channeling system prepends channel routing information and a packet
checksum. Multiple channel messages are combined into a secondary
packet to maximize usage of available bandwidth. This secondary
packet is termed a &ldquo;RIC&rdquo; packet; it serves as an interface
abstraction to the Rack Interface Computer which is used onboard
the International Space Station to communicate to the different
payloads. RIC packet contents are also sanity checked via an
additional checksum. Finally, the RIC packet is encapsulated into a
TCP/IP packet for delivery to the payload.</p><p>Communication between the RIC and the payloads is TCP/IP
based for reliable communications. Unfortunately, telemetry data
transmitted from the payload to the RIC ends up being distributed
on the ground from the Marshall Space Flight Center to the remote
users via UDP, which is unreliable. In addition, the physical
communications link in the form of the TDRSS satellite network is
subject to outages as well. To minimize the potential impact of
dropping packets and loss of signal caused by holes in the
available TDRSS satellite network coverage, a &ldquo;playback&rdquo; system
has been implemented that retransmits critical information to
improve the probability that a complete set of telemetry data files
is received properly by the ground stations.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4061f14.large.jpg"><img src="4061f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 14. Interface for Payload to Groundside
Communications</p></div></div>
</p><p>Finally, one of the channels has been configured to serve as
a remote shell on the payload. Input to and output from the bash
shell is first redirected to a channel and then packetized as
described above. In this manner a true remote shell operates on the
actual payload in a manner that is functionally equivalent to
establishing a remote connection via TELNET or ssh. The bash shell
input and output is &ldquo;tunneled&rdquo; through the NASA communications
scheme and allows the possibility of remote system administration
activities from the ground. Just try and implement that capability
under Windows! For further information concerning the design of the
communications subsystem, please see the excellent article &ldquo;Linux
Out of the Real World&rdquo;, by Sebastian Kuzminsky, which appeared in
<i  >Linux Journal</i> in July of 1997.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1e6e3a8"></a>Linux in the Classroom</h2></div></div><p>As the economy of the United States transitions from the
Industrial Age to the Information Age, students from all
engineering disciplines are required to enable the automation and
control of large and small industrial production processes. The per
dollar cost of storage media, CPU cycles and interface hardware
continues to decline, allowing research agencies and for-profit
companies to implement automation of their production processes in
an effort to decrease costs and increase profit margin. At the
College of Engineering and Sciences, located on the main campus of
the University of Colorado, a new teaching paradigm has been
realized with the completion of the Integrated Teaching and
Learning Laboratory (ITLL). The ITLL was built as a resource for
students of all engineering disciplines to facilitate the transfer
of theory learned in the classroom to actual practice in the
laboratory, in an effort to teach real world engineering and
scientific skills.</p><p>The ITLL provides the resources to allow students to design
and build complex engineering projects. A typical lab station is
shown in Figure 15. Each of the lab stations is equipped with a
Hewlett-Packard Vectra PC with a 500MHz Pentium-III processor,
384MB of RAM, an 8GB hard drive, the usual NIC and a National
Instruments analog and digital data acquisition card. Several of
the 80 available systems have been configured to boot Linux and
RTLinux, in addition to Windows NT. Standard test equipment at each
lab station includes a waveform generator, digital multi-meter,
variable-voltage power supply and oscilloscope. The breakout panel
provides easy access to analog and digital IO signals and to
signal-conditioning hardware. The availability of sophisticated
test equipment, coupled with the capabilities of the Linux and
RTLinux operating systems, has enabled students to design and
construct complex, real world applications integrating both
hardware and software to accomplish a specified engineering or
scientific task.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4061f15.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 15. An ITLL Workstation Running
Linux/RTLinux.</p></div></div>
</p><p>One such project is the University of Colorado's Robotic
Autonomous Transport, a.k.a. the RATmobile, shown in Figure 16. The
RATmobile is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) that navigates
autonomously by sensing static and dynamic features within its
environment. This vehicle was designed entirely from scratch by a
group of undergraduate and graduate students from several
engineering disciplines with supervision and guidance from members
of the Aerospace department. Design and construction of the vehicle
is truly multi-disciplinary, calling upon the theory and expertise
of mechanical, electrical, aerospace and computer sciences.</p><p>The vehicle uses miniature video cameras mounted on the front
to supply visual information concerning the surrounding
environment. Static and dynamic obstacle detection is supplemented
by an array of ultrasonic sensors. The sensed environmental
conditions are combined into a local coordinate frame and then
translated into a world representation map that contains the
totality of the robot's knowledge concerning its environment.
Depending upon the task at hand, the robot is able to make use of
different navigational algorithms to traverse to a desired
destination.</p><p>One such navigational mode allows for the vehicle to navigate
an obstacle course that is delimited by painted white lines on a
large field. The lines are approximately ten feet apart with
straightaways, sharp curves and bends and even some occurrences of
missing lines, which require that the navigation algorithm predict
the desired vehicle direction based upon historical information. A
second navigational mode makes use of differential GPS information
for precise assessment of the robot's position in a world reference
frame. In this mode, the vehicle has a priori knowledge of its
static environment and can navigate to a predetermined location
while avoiding unmapped or dynamic obstacles. Different
navigational strategies, such as the optimization of path length or
required path energy, are easily implemented.</p><p>Linux was chosen as the operating system for this project
because it met all design requirements, allowed for a multi- user
development environment and was free, which is of concern to
students with a limited project budget. The capability of the
multi-threaded software control architecture provided by Linux
allows for easy implementation of differing vehicle capabilities.
The primary functions of the vehicle, visual image acquisition;
obstacle detection information acquisition; combination of input
sensory data into a world representation; and the determination of
the required navigational control outputs of velocity and steer
angle, are all abstracted to different threads. If necessary, the
CPU scheduling policy associated with different processes can be
altered from the default scheduler, which optimizes for the average
case, to allow for improved real-time performance under the
standard Linux OS. In process control systems, where millisecond
and below guaranteed scheduling is required, a real-time Linux
variant, such as RTLinux, can be used.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4061f16.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 16. The Robotic Autonomous Transport
(RATmobile)</p></div></div>
</p><p>The ITLL stations, running either Linux or RTLinux, are also
used in a class emphasizing hardware/software integration skills to
undergraduate and graduate students. Advanced programming
constructs, in the C and C++ languages, are required by laboratory
exercises that emphasize the integration of real hardware, such as
motors and micro-controllers. This allows students to develop
confidence and expertise not just in proper software programming
practices, but in combining control hardware with the standard PC.
Examples of final student projects (all using Linux or RTLinux) in
this class include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A working mockup of a spin stabilized satellite
that uses image processing to determine orientation within a star
field.</p></li><li><p>A directionally controlled scanning laser used to
determine mechanical vibrational modes within a structure.</p></li><li><p>Transmission of real-time accelerometer data from a
radio controlled airplane with subsequent real-time plotting
capability.</p></li><li><p>The construction of a fluid chamber to model fluid
flow through different chambers of the heart with associated
real-time data gathering for analysis.</p></li></ul></div><p>Using the Linux OS and user-configurable development
environments as a basis, we are able to impart a greater breadth of
knowledge to our students, which is applicable to real world
engineering problems. That is a true accomplishment whose accolades
belong to the numerous kernel and development programmers whom have
contributed to the power and success of Linux.
</p><p>Linux also serves as a powerful teaching tool within our
Computer Science department. The free availability of the Linux OS
and associated development packages have opened the doors to a
greater variety of course content in classes pertaining to Systems
Administration. With a free operating system and the availability
of cheap PC hardware, students have the ability to configure and
administer all aspects of their very own system within a university
computer lab. If something goes dramatically wrong, it is a simple
matter to restore the entire disk across a network from a master
system. This encourages students to experiment with no disastrous
repercussions. Topics such as disk-level file recovery, device
installation and management, user and file administration, kernel
configuration and networking are all candidates for easily
constructed exercises using the free Linux OS as the enabling
technology.</p><p>Open source distribution of the Linux kernel source tree has
allowed courses in Operating Systems Theory to not only teach the
fundamentals but, even more importantly, allow the students to
experiment with changes to the kernel code. As a result, students
are offered a richer set of exercises that can be applied directly
to the kernel source and not just on paper. Most assuredly,
students will break their systems while experimenting, but system
recovery strategies have definite educational value&mdash;better now on
a cheap PC running Linux than on some multi-million dollar platform
in the future. Having the kernel source allows for in-depth
exercises in far-ranging topics including management of processes,
resources, devices, files and memory, as well as implementation of
kernel-space processes as Linux modules, scheduling policies and
priorities, and fundamental synchronization methodologies. Linux
enables a richer and more realistic educational experience for our
students.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1e6ef00"></a>Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>When designing and building complex systems, which require
low-level integration of software and hardware, there are numerous
design trade-offs and decisions to be made. Two primary criteria
that are always evaluated are: can the system meet the specified
performance requirements, and can the system meet imposed budgetary
constraints? Based upon past experience, both Linux and its
real-time variants meet or exceed the typical performance metrics.
The development environment is powerful and easily configurable.
Operating system services are ample, and resource abstraction
follows the standard, simple, UNIX-like methodology. One design
issue that is of fundamental concern to companies within the
commercial sector is that of technical support. With the advent of
Linux-only technical support companies, along with an increased
base of competent Linux programmers, this issue is dwindling in
comparison to the numerous advantages of a free, open-source
operating system. Budgetary constraints are a non-issue. A
world-class group of kernel hackers continue to provide support for
cutting-edge technologies and hardware. Students of today, who are
the programmers and systems managers of tomorrow, are being taught
to harness the enabling power of Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x197b580.0x1e6f008"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Linux is used for a myriad of research, commercial and
educational purposes at the University of Colorado. The systems
designed and built are complex and, must be reliable. The payloads
BioServe builds are currently scheduled to spend over three years
in combined time onboard the International Space Station, and
computer control, implemented under the Linux OS, is a
mission-critical design specification. From the performance of past
payloads, in addition to the complex projects previously described,
the author is confident of continued success. Linux is the enabling
resource that allows the integration of these projects. Linux has
provided meaningful content for several courses taught within our
Aerospace and Computer Science departments and is responsible, in
part, for the success of our real-world teaching paradigm, which
takes theory out of the classroom and allows for practical
implementations of advanced projects and research.</p><p><a href="4061s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="4061s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
