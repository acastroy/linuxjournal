There's nothing complicated about it, right? Well, try configuring
sendmail on a Linux server. Recently, I needed to set up a Linux
server at work for e-mail service. It seemed like a simple enough
task, but it quickly proved to be quite frustrating. It's one of
those projects that requires paging through endless scripts, man
pages and books. Don't bother asking anyone for help&mdash;you're on
your own. Being a book lover, though, I saw it as an opportunity to
visit the bookstore!</p><p>A very comprehensive book about sendmail was published by
O'Reilly. I just love O'Reilly's books&mdash;usually. Their
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail</em></span> book is a killer: about a thousand
pages long, very detailed and very advanced. I quietly put that
back on the shelf after a couple minutes of looking at it (although
I did go back to it three times, hoping I was too hasty). It took
quite a bit of rummaging to find anything covering sendmail. Most
authors touch on it only briefly&mdash;they know to stay away from it. I
did buy one book that was fairly helpful in learning how to set up
various Internet services, including e-mail: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Red Hat
Linux 6 Server</em></span> by Mohammed J. Kabir (M&amp;T Books,
1999). However, it wasn't quite sufficient. Besides, no good Linux
task is solved with only one book purchase.</p><p>After many failed attempts at configuring sendmail and three
visits to the bookstore (I have an undying belief that all my
problems can be solved with books), I discovered Richard Blum's new
title, <span   class="emphasis"><em>sendmail for Linux</em></span>. The answer to my
prayers! Not that it offers any quick fixes, but it explains fairly
clearly how to set up an e-mail server. It's about 500 pages of
useful information with plenty of diagrams, screenshots and brief
(let me say that again: <span   class="emphasis"><em>brief</em></span>) configuration
examples. I hate it when books are loaded with long scripts that
are already on my computer, just so I can admire them in a printed
and bound format. There's also the customary CD. This one includes
a distribution of Linux, qmail, Eudora Light and a few other
related programs.</p><p>Blum's book is broken up into three sections: an introduction
to e-mail services, installation instructions and sundry items. The
introduction is an in-depth educational primer on e-mail. At first
I skipped this part, but as I dug into the second section, I
realized I didn't know as much as I thought about e-mail, even
after something like a decade or so of using it. So, I went back to
basics, and read through the first section. It was worth the
effort. In addition to a minimal amount of history, Blum covers
DNS, SMTP, IMAP, POP and sendmail itself. You see, it's not just
sendmail, but everything related that makes it so involved.</p><p>With the foundation of the first section, the second
describes basic configurations to make sendmail work. Blum explains
what's necessary to get e-mail running for typical scenarios. The
second section also covers setting up clients in Netscape, Outlook
Express and Eudora; integrating e-mail service with an ISP; and the
system administration involved.</p><p>The third section contains instructions on integrating an
e-mail server with a firewall (e.g., ipchains and ipforward). It
also includes setting up dial-in clients, e-mail aliases,
masquerading and list servers. Yes, you too can be a major
domo.</p><p>Let me wrap up now with something that Blum's publisher might
want to quote: it's a comprehensive, but not overwhelming, manual
on sendmail for the intermediate-level Linux system administrator.
It's well-written, well-illustrated and well-edited; an
educational, extremely useful and desperately needed resource on
e-mail service.</p></div></div>
