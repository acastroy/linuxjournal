    A free programming system for high-end interactive computer graphics.

programmers create virtual environments (VEs). It was built by an
academic research group to tackle some of the problems found when
using existing approaches to VE construction. Maverik's main
contribution is its <span   class="emphasis"><em>framework</em></span> for managing
graphics and interaction, but it comes with extensive built-in
functionality to make getting started straightforward. However,
Maverik is a tool for programmers&mdash;it is not an end-user
application.
</p><p>Maverik is part of the GNU project and is distributed freely
with full source under the GNU GPL. The distribution includes
documentation, a tutorial and examples. Released in February 1999,
Maverik has been downloaded by thousands of sites worldwide, and
received positive feedback from both academic and commercial
organizations.</p><p>In this article, I give some background to the challenges
facing the designers of Virtual Environments and then describe how
Maverik addresses some of these.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be1580.0x1cd9870"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>It's easy to get enthusiastic about interactive 3-D graphics,
and to imagine great things&mdash;walking around inside your dream
house; conversing face to face with a distant friend in a shared
paradise; or rehearsing complex engineering procedures with
professional colleagues around the world in a shared virtual
environment.</p><p>These things are easy to imagine, but surprisingly hard to
do&mdash;witness the lack of really compelling examples of this kind of
technology in use. So what's the problem? Until quite recently the
limitations of computer hardware and VR peripherals were seen to be
the limiting factor. In the last year or so, PC graphics
accelerators have made dramatic strides forward as 3-D becomes a
more mainstream facility. Today inexpensive 3-D PC accelerators
rival the performance of the most expensive 3-D workstations, and
are beginning to include options such as economic stereo
shutterglass support.</p><p>The limiting factor&mdash;the gap between what we can so easily
imagine and what we can readily achieve&mdash;is now more clearly
exposed as being software. Writing 3-D applications is hard work.
It takes hundreds of person-hours (programmers and artists) to
create the impressive games and animated film sequences we have
come to expect of 3-D computer graphics. Yet film animations such
as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Toy Story</em></span> use techniques that are way
beyond what can be achieved at interactive framerates. The best of
today's PC graphics cards is something like 10,000 times too slow
to do <span   class="emphasis"><em>Toy Story</em></span> in real time. That is largely
due to the complexity of the modeling and sophisticated lighting
calculations used. It is possible to do impressive things in real
time, as computer games demonstrate. But games rely upon methods
such as texture mapping to give the illusion of complexity within a
VE far beyond what is actually present. In a game, the complex
metalwork and scenery that you see are mostly stage scenery: you
cannot take the girder away from the wall, it's only a picture of a
girder.</p><p>In contrast, for real engineering tasks, the complexity of
the CAD models can be staggering&mdash;a model of a real offshore
platform can, for example, equate to half a gigabyte of polygonal
data which must somehow be processed 10-30 times per second if it
is to be any use for interactive work in a VE (see Figure
1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4035f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Offshore Platform</p></div></div>
</p><p>Let's think about the kind of things that need to be done to
work with a model of this complexity; this will help understand the
reasoning behind Maverik. To cope with the offshore platform, we
need to find ways of rapidly focusing in on only those parts that
need drawing at any one instant. For example, in a building with
many rooms, you can quickly discard large parts of the model that
you know cannot be seen from the current position. In a large
&ldquo;cityscape&rdquo; at ground level, we could work out which buildings
you can see that are not occluded by others, and rapidly discard
everything else. So some application-specific tests can quickly
discard a lot of irrelevant data. In some cases, those do not work;
for the offshore platform, we can see between the pipes all the way
across the rig, so we need a different strategy. In the limit,
though, we will run out of time to render the current frame, so
some bail-out option is necessary. One example would be to fall
back to a wire-frame representation for more distant parts of the
view (see Figure 2). That does not make such a nice still picture,
but if it lets you work interactively within the VE, then it might
be tremendously effective compared to a &ldquo;jerky&rdquo;
presentation.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4035f2.large.jpg"><img src="4035f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Wire Frame Bounding Boxes</p></div></div>
</p><p>A promising approach is to replace the wire-frame portion
with image-based rendering techniques, filling in the background
with appropriate still pictures of the rig. These stills are then
dynamically distorted so you do not notice that they are stills.
That is a subject of current research. For a VE, it is important to
make any such transitions between representations smoothly, and
avoid objects &ldquo;popping&rdquo; between different rendering styles, which
is quite disturbing.</p><p>Most of these techniques are well understood individually,
but the particular combination of tricks employed to get enough
speed are often highly application-specific. Putting together each
frame, whilst managing other issues such as user navigation and
application behaviour, is quite a challenge. At present, if you
want to attempt this, you have two basic strategies
available.</p><p>First, you could program the whole thing from the ground up
in your favourite language and a 3-D graphics library such as Mesa
or OpenGL. This gives you a lot of flexibility&mdash;you can do anything
that's possible, and at the best performance attainable. The
drawback is that for a sophisticated task, this can be like
programming an operating system in assembler. It's too low a level,
and hence hard to re-use what you write for different kinds of
applications.</p><p>Your second choice is to use a proprietary package for
building Virtual Worlds. Such a package will get you going quickly,
and hopefully has built-in high-level support for your desires&mdash;for
example, making your VE sharable between several users. To support
these high-level features, the VE package has its own internal
complexity and representations of the VE, which is, after all, what
you are buying. The drawback here is that the complexity within the
VE system may not be appropriate for what you want to do (i.e., a
&ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; approach may not work). If you have a complex
application, it will have its own data structures and algorithms
tuned to that application. In the case of the offshore platform,
the CAD system that built it talks in terms of ladders, pipes,
valves and so on&mdash;quite high-level descriptions. To use this data
with the VE building package, it will have to be exported from the
CAD system, and imported in whatever format the VE system
understands internally. The common denominator is, more often than
not, a &ldquo;sea of polygons&rdquo;. So in exporting the data into the VE
system's general-purpose format, much of the interesting
information on what those polygons mean is lost, and with it the
potential for exploiting that information to win speed.</p><p>A second problem with this approach is that if someone within
the VE manipulates the objects (disconnecting a pipe or valve for
example), then somehow that has to be communicated back to your CAD
application which must then update its own data structures. So you
get two representations of the world, one within the application,
and one within the VE system, and these have to be kept
synchronized.</p><p>So an &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; VE building package does what it
does, well. But as the desire for complex VEs increases, we
encounter problems of programming complexity, and the inherent
performance limitations of maintaining two different models of the
data&mdash;one of which is probably an unwieldy sea of polygons.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be1580.0x1cda1b8"></a>Maverik&mdash;A Middle Way?</h2></div></div><p>Is there any middle way possible? Can we construct some
framework that supports the creation and management of VEs, without
limiting what can be built to some lowest common
denominator?</p><p>We believe there is, and the result of those efforts is GNU
Maverik. A framework for interactive VEs has now been used
successfully to implement a range of VE applications with markedly
different demands and optimization strategies.</p><p>Maverik is a C toolkit that lives on top of a 3-D rendering
library such as Mesa or OpenGL, providing facilities for managing a
VE. It is best viewed as the next layer of functionality you would
want above the raw 3-D graphics library. The novel aspect of
Maverik is that it <span   class="emphasis"><em>does not have its own internal data
structures</em></span> for the VE. Instead, it makes direct use of
an application's own data structures, via a callback mechanism
(rather like callbacks are used in window managers such as
X11).</p><p>An application tells Maverik about the classes of objects it
wishes to render, and supplies functions needed to do the
rendering. Maverik supplies facilities for building flexible
spatial management structures (SMSes) with which the registered
objects are managed. As the user navigates the environment, Maverik
tracks the SMSes and makes appropriate calls on the application to
render its objects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be1580.0x1cda420"></a>What Is the Gain?</h2></div></div><p>The application keeps control of its data, so there is only
one copy to manage. More crucially, the application can bring all
its knowledge of what the data means to bear when deciding how to
render the objects; we find this is where the most telling
optimizations come from. For example, if 3-D text is important to
the application, then a good data structure would probably involve
text strings and position information. However, exporting the 3-D
text to a self-contained VE package will probably mean exporting
the data in a common graphics format&mdash;usually polygons. The VE
system will have a lot more data to process than we would like,
which limits the size of environment we can construct.</p><p>With Maverik, the application might register the class
&ldquo;3-Dstring&rdquo;. Later, when the user navigates around the
environment, Maverik determines from the SMSes that certain objects
are in view. For 3-Dstring objects, it calls the application
supplied functions to render those, and the application then
generates the polygons on the fly. The application can use whatever
optimizations are appropriate when generating the polygons, which
makes techniques such as dynamic level of detail, and coping with
objects that change their shape, straightforward. In this way,
Maverik can be a general-purpose framework, and yet benefit from
optimal data representations and highly application-specific
optimizations.</p><p>The 3-D text example is part of a real application&mdash;the
&ldquo;Legible City II&rdquo;, a multimedia artwork by Jeffrey Shaw (ZKM
Germany). It uses the above technique to render three large cities
(Amsterdam, Manhattan and Karlsruhe) of words (see Figure 3). To
render a more game-like environment, the application callbacks will
use the more traditional games techniques to render their objects
(see Figure 4).</p><p>

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4035f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Special-Effects Techniques Common in
Games</p></div></div>
</p><p>For the Oil Rig, the CAD application's native data structures
(pipes, valves, walkways and so forth) are used in a similar way.
When the application is called to render a tower, it can decide
what would be an appropriate rendering for this frame&mdash;for example,
it may decide to always render the tower, because it is an
important landmark for navigation. Thus, the application can change
representations dynamically to suit conditions. Similarly,
applications with special lighting algorithms (see Figure 5), or
atypical behaviours such as abstract information visualization (see
Figure 6) use their own bespoke structures and algorithms to
maintain real time performance.</p><p>

</p><p>Examples of work done with Maverik are given in the Maverik
gallery on the web page. The important feature is that the video
sequences (which are quite large files) are all captured directly
from a 450MHz PIII Linux PC using a Voodoo2 3-D accelerator, and
give a good impression of what performance can be attained with a
cost-effective hardware setup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be1580.0x1cd1758"></a>Is This Cheating?</h2></div></div><p>What we have gained is the flexibility to plug together quite
different applications within a single VE framework, without
compromising performance. That is a gain, but seems to be at the
expense of having the application (and application programmer) do
all the hard work. However, because Maverik is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>framework</em></span> into which things can be plugged
with little performance loss, it is easy to provide commonly useful
facilities and objects to get many applications off the ground. For
example, Maverik is distributed with libraries of common geometric
primitives, cones, cylinders, teapots, an animated avatar, sample
graphics file parsers, navigation facilities, 3-D math functions,
quarternion codes, stereo, 3-D peripheral drivers for head-mounted
display and 3-D mice (see Figure 7) and so forth). If these are
useful, then you use them as a good starting point. If they are
not, then you provide your own objects and algorithms, perhaps
refining the samples provided.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4035f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Immersive Editing</p></div></div>
</p><p>This makes it fairly straightforward to get started using the
system. In practice, this gives three levels of increasingly
sophisticated use.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Using the default objects and algorithms provided.
Used this way, Maverik looks like a VR building package for
programmers. The tutorial documentation for the system leads one
through the building of an environment with behaviour, collision
detection and customized navigation.</p></li><li><p>Defining your own classes of objects. This is where
you benefit from application-specific optimizations that you could
supply by providing your own rendering and associated callbacks.
The tutorial gives an example of this, and the supplied
demonstration applications make extensive use of the techniques.
Unfortunately, the offshore platform example uses commercially
sensitive data, so cannot be supplied with the distribution.</p></li><li><p>Extension and modification of the Maverik kernel.
Rendering and navigation callbacks are one set of facilities that
can be customized. For the adventurous, more of the Maverik core
functionality is also up for grabs: for example, alternate culling
strategies, spatial management structures and input device support.
But this still takes place within the context of a consistent
framework that seems to make it easy to plug different parts
together.</p></li></ol></div><p>The real test for Maverik as a research vehicle is how well
it allows such pieces to fit into the overall puzzle. The hope is
that it will make the task of building VEs &ldquo;as hard as it should
be&rdquo;, avoiding the feeling that one's efforts are mostly spent
&ldquo;fighting the system&rdquo;. So far, given a little familiarity with
the approach, this looks very promising.

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4035f8.large.jpg"><img src="4035f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 8. Navigation Algorithms</p></div></div>
</p><p>Recent Maverik developments include a novel force-field
navigation algorithm to guide participants around obstacles, and an
algorithm for probing geometry ahead of a user to test whether it
can be climbed&mdash;for example, ladders and steps (see Figure 8).
These algorithms integrate into Maverik, but at the time of this
writing are released as separate beta sources for testing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be1580.0x1cd2048"></a>What You Can't Do with Maverik</h2></div></div><p>Maverik has no support for audio or video within it. You will
need to add your favourite mechanism for those yourself.</p><p>Maverik is a single-user VE micro-kernel. It does not include
any assistance for running multiple VEs on different machines for
sharing a world between people. To do that, you would need to
synchronize the VEs yourself across the network. For just
navigating around a shared VE, that's not so hard. Running a system
with many users across wide area networks with multiple VEs,
applications, interaction and behaviour is a more complex
challenge. It's a challenge we are working on now with a
complementary system that uses Maverik. We aim to release what we
have on that under the GNU GPL license later this year.</p><p>We are very keen to know how well these ideas work, or don't
work, for other people&mdash;particularly those with experience of
graphics programming. That way, we get to understand more about
this whole area. Feedback should be addressed to
