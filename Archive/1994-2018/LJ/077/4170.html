    Adomo uses a client-server approach.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x1922450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Adomo (http://www.adomo.com) wants to
fill your home with a network of low-cost, easy-to-use information
appliances. Best of all, they'll each have Linux inside.
</p><p>Adomo's plans are to transcend the boundaries of the PC
revolution, making home information appliances as easy to use&mdash;and
ubiquitous&mdash;as microwave ovens. To accomplish this, they chose to
redefine the very nature of home information systems. They started
out by asking, &ldquo;What do family members really want?&rdquo;</p><p>A &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; architecture.</p><p>That quest led to a product architecture that runs counter,
in many ways, to the current PC paradigm. Contrary to the popular
notion of intelligent interconnected appliances as the wave of the
future, Adomo's architecture is a lot like the &ldquo;pre-PC&rdquo;
multi-user computers and dumb terminals of 25 years ago&mdash;but with
some important differences.</p><p>Adomo's solution creates a home network that consists of two
types of devices: a highly intelligent central device (the
&ldquo;server&rdquo;) which provides computing, information storage and
Internet access resources; and multiple wirelessly linked
user-interface devices (&ldquo;clients&rdquo;) distributed throughout the
home.</p><p>But there's an important twist: although the user-interface
devices function like intelligent information appliances, they
don't actually run any application software internally. They just
pass data back and forth to the central server.</p><p>This approach can work&mdash;since today's high speed networks can
provide near-instantaneous access to massive amounts of computing
power and vast quantities of data. In other words, as Sun puts it,
&ldquo;the computer is the network&rdquo;. That being the case, the
distinction between server and client becomes moot!</p><p>This way, the CPU within the appliance needn't be capable of
running sophisticated programs. Its main purpose is managing
input/output functions, which are mostly user-interface-related.
Each appliance runs just one program: a reduced-footprint version
of the X Window System. All the application programs run on the
central server. Only display output (graphics, sound) and user
input (keyboard, mouse, sound) travel back and forth between the
server and the appliances.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x19227c0"></a>Thin Is In</h2></div></div><p>By restricting their function to input/output only, Adomo's
extremely &ldquo;thin&rdquo; information appliances become simplified to the
point where they are mere interface terminals rather than computers
(even though they do contain microprocessors). This has some
interesting consequences.</p><p>One is that changes in context&mdash;between family members, or
between OFF and ON&mdash;are nearly instantaneous. Since the appliance
is just an interface to software running on the server, all
appliances can be used interchangeably. Just sign on, and pick up
where you left off. No need to wait around while the OS inside the
user interface of a refrigerator or microwave logs out one user,
and prepares itself for access by another.</p><p>Another big advantage of extremely thin appliances is that
they're smaller and cost less. Also, they generate less heat, and
run longer on a battery charge.</p><p>An interesting side effect is that because the appliances
don't contain their own application software, there is hardly
anything to go wrong from a software perspective. All they need to
do is be able to load their operating software from the server,
across the wireless LAN. That, plus their accompanying electronic
simplicity, means the appliances are likely to be completely free
from the headaches of maintenance and administration&mdash;or at least
that's the plan.</p><p>Even system administration is simplified, since all software
for operating the entire home system is concentrated on the server,
a Linux system. That should make remote maintenance and support a
snap.</p><p>Of course, for the Adomo client/server scheme to work, the
server had better be powerful enough to handle the activities of
all the client devices located throughout the home. Also, the
wireless LAN needs to have sufficient bandwidth to carry all the
associated data transfers. Adomo claims the performance of their
server will support the simultaneous activities of up to eight
&ldquo;typical&rdquo; family members.</p><p>Does that include teenagers playing the latest video games?
Probably not. For that reason, Adomo also lets you use one or more
normal PCs on the network. In that case, the Adomo server provides
connectivity, application sharing, file storage and backup for all
devices&mdash;both PC or non-PC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x1922ad8"></a>The Server</h2></div></div><p>The Adomo server is functionally similar to a high-end PC
running Linux. But, as you can see from the photo (see Figure 1),
it looks more like an appliance (possibly an air conditioner) than
a PC.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4170f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Adomo Server
</p></div></div><p>Inside, there's a custom motherboard based on an AMD mobile
K6 processor. Adomo's engineers took advantage of laptop-like
components in designing the server, to reduce power consumption and
heat dissipation. This lessens the need for noisy fans, and should
boost system reliability.</p><p>The server is a multi-tasking, multi-user computer system
that provides a variety of shared resources and managerial
functions, including those of Internet gateway, firewall, e-mail,
file storage and system backup. And don't forget:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> application programs for all client
devices run on the server, not on the devices.</p><p>Although the server isn't promoted as such, you can add a
monitor and keyboard and use it as an additional desktop system. In
that case, it will run all the same application programs available
to the client devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x1922ef8"></a>The Wing</h2></div></div><p>The first information appliance Adomo will deliver is a sleek
unit called the &ldquo;Wing&rdquo; (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4170f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Adomo Wing
</p></div></div><p>The Wing is a multi-function user-interface appliance that
contains a 90MHz Motorola Coldfire system-on-chip processor and a
VGA display controller, along with interfaces for infrared
keyboard/mouse, PS/2 mouse, microphone and speakers. An internal
PCMCIA socket provides the wireless LAN connection. The Wing has a
small built-in speaker and microphone, and provides jacks for
optional connection of external high-quality stereo speakers and
microphone.</p><p>Since the Wing is simply a nice-looking but &ldquo;dumb&rdquo;
terminal, it can be used for a variety of purposes. Hook it up to a
monitor, keyboard and mouse, and it acts like a PC. Leave those off
and connect it to high-quality stereo speakers, and it becomes a
wireless music system that plays Internet radio, CDs and
MP3s.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x1923268"></a>Making Use of Voice</h2></div></div><p>One of Adomo's strategies to make their products
&ldquo;family-friendly&rdquo; is extensive use of voice for both commands and
data. What could be more natural for family-oriented systems?
Accordingly, family members will be able to leave each other voice
messages as easily as e-mail messages, and in much the same
way.</p><p>Despite recent progress, however, decent-quality voice
recognition still requires desktop-level computing power. This
limits the voice-recognition capabilities of low-cost information
appliances. But in the Adomo client/server architecture, the
devices need only send 10KBps voice data to the server. There,
high-end CPU resources are available to process it. The result:
low-power, inexpensive appliances benefit from high-end speech
recognition technology.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x19233c8"></a>Benefits of Linux and Open Source</h2></div></div><p>Why did Adomo choose to use Linux? &ldquo;On the client side,
scalability, modularity and availability of source, which allowed
us to customize the OS to meet our exact requirements, were key
reasons for using Linux,&rdquo; says Adomo CEO Samir Lehaff. &ldquo;On the
server side, Linux offered us a highly stable multi-user OS,
without the usual licensing and serialization headaches associated
with trying to use Windows NT in an embedded product.&rdquo;</p><p>The Adomo application required customizing a Linux server OS
to make it suitable for the home environment and developing a set
of hosted applications for home users. The server is based on a Red
Hat Linux distribution, along with the Netscape Mozilla open-source
browser. The applications are aimed at communications, web
browsing, data manipulation and organization, backup and household
task management. One such application is an MP3 music jukebox. The
client devices run a diskless X-terminal version of uCLinux ported
to a Motorola Coldfire microprocessor. This provides an economical
and versatile platform for a wide range of future devices.</p><p>Adomo's embedded Linux-based development project benefited
greatly from collaboration with the Open Source community. For
example, Adomo had to grow uCLinux from its normal headless
&ldquo;network box&rdquo; configuration into a full-fledged X-terminal
implementation, while still maintaining a small memory footprint.
For assistance with that challenge, Adomo turned to embedded Linux
specialists at Moreton Bay (now a Lineo company).</p><p>Similarly, SuSE provided some important help in implementing
a truly embeddable X server for the client devices. This took the
form of Tiny-X, a reduced-footprint implementation of the X Window
System that requires less than 800KB of memory.</p><p>Another challenge was running Linux on client devices that
don't contain application program-load memory, beyond a small ROM
used for system bootstrap. Instead, the client devices boot Linux
remotely via wireless LAN. Help in overcoming this problem came
from the Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) team.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x1923630"></a>How &ldquo;Open&rdquo; is It?</h2></div></div><p>Will Adomo allow third-party developers or even users to
modify how the system operates? &ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo; says Adomo CEO
Lehaff. He says the company will post its embedded Linux
technology, as GPL, on its web site. The company will also
encourage third-party developers to create both software
applications and additional client devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182a580.0x1923738"></a>Production Plans</h2></div></div><p>Adomo plans to launch its products in October 2000, with
production ramp-up in time for the 2000 holiday season. Lehaff
describes the target market as &ldquo;technology-friendly families who
are faced with organizing and networking a growing number of
Internet-connected devices in the home.&rdquo; In addition to the server
and the Wing, Adomo plans to introduce two additional products
early next year: AdomoPad, a battery-operated wireless touch-screen
pad that integrates web browsing and telephone functions, will be
used like a jumbo PDA; and AdomoTune, a device that will allow
digital music received from the server or the Internet to be played
over high-quality audio equipment.</p></div></div>
