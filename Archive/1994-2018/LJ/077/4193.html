    Part One of Doc Searls' talk with the father of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
    Phil
    Hughes, about UNIX, GUI computing and the joys of an (almost) purely
    Linux publishing house.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4193f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cbc580.0x1db4710"></a></h2></div></div><p> I met Phil in 1990, not long after I met
my wife, Joyce. It was kind of a package deal. Joyce collected
interesting friends, and Phil was near the top of her list. She had
met him earlier in Seattle while she was dating another UNIX geek.
Both shared the curse of knowing they were smarter than pretty much
everybody else (although Joyce is a bit more modest about it),
along with a raft of common interests including travel, business,
food and constant repartee spiced with affectionate insults.
</p><p>Phil Hughes has been around computing longer than most humans
have been on earth. He also knows a significant trend when he sees
one, which is why he turned his attention to Linux before most of
the world even noticed the Net.</p><p>In '93 and '94, he flattered me by including my e-mail
address in a list that explored the idea of doing a free-software
magazine. I followed as best I could (for a geek who was definitely
not in the same caste as the other listees). But we were all
surprised when Phil suddenly decided to do a magazine on Linux.
What the hell was Linux? Phil knew.</p><p>In '94, when the 1.0 kernel came out, so did <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I was amazed to see how steadily it grew, and
how (as usual) Phil seemed to be right about Linux's inevitable
triumph in the marketplace. Even though it was free, business would
find it more useful than most of the costly stuff it competed with,
he said, just like it did with the Net. And, as with the Net,
commercial development was inevitable.</p><p>In early '99, Phil showed me StarOffice running on a Linux
laptop with KDE. It looked like such a Windows killer that the
possibilities blew my mind. Then he asked me to join
<i  >Linux Journal</i> to expand coverage of business
issues, so I did. (This was right around the same time I started
co-writing <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span>, which was
kind of a double-whammy career move for me.)</p><p>Last August, Red Hat went public. Cobalt, VA Linux and
Andover followed. Billions of dollars in new Linux wealth was
created in less than two seasons. And then, it melted like snow at
the end of winter. The mainstream press, especially the old PC
rags, began tarring Linux as last year's fad. But, as Phil is quick
to point out, the sum of Linux companies together adds up to a lot
more value now than they did a year before. Again, the long view.
Since we're both 52, it's one I understand.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls</b></span>: You were an old
hand at UNIX when Linus was still a kid messing around with a
Commodore VIC-20. What can you tell us about UNIX that seems to be
forgotten as the Linux industry moves into enterprises where the
most familiar computing worlds are Microsoft NT and Windows?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: My first UNIX exposure
was in 1980, when I convinced the company I worked for that a UNIX
system and the C language would solve all our problems. This was
with an engineering-based company that manufactured semiconductor
test equipment.</p><p>What we needed was a software development environment where a
handful of engineers and programmers were writing code to control
the equipment we were designing. UNIX was the right choice, because
we needed a cooperative environment where multiple users could
share files; we needed compilers and assemblers; and we needed the
building blocks to put together some support tools, such as
programs that could reformat and download code into the machines we
were building.</p><p>Someone, possibly Dennis Ritchie, described UNIX as a toolbox
full of tools. When you were presented with a problem, you would
divide it up into a set of smaller problems and then see if there
were tools available to solve each smaller problem. It wasn't
uncommon to write a little C code, maybe an awk or sed script, and
a few calls to utilities such as sort and uniq and glue the whole
thing together with a shell script.</p><p>This is much different from today's GUI approach, where you
find one huge monolithic program and try to coax it into doing what
you want. Maybe you can&mdash;but if you can't, you are at a dead
end.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: This is the stuff I
learned (which might be an exaggeration, but let's pretend) in the
excellent &ldquo;Intro to Linux&rdquo; class I took at SGI
(<a href="http://www.sgi.com/support" target="_self">http://www.sgi.com/support/</a>)
a few weeks ago. What amazed me was that the toolbox nature of UNIX
made both creating tools and solving problems extremely easy. Sure,
you can do sophisticated searches with the GUI Find command in KDE,
GNOME and the PC operating systems, but the speed, flexibility and
innate sophistication just aren't there. And they're slow.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: This is always an
issue when we hire new people. They can be productive sooner if we
hand them StarOffice, but investing in them and teaching them shell
commands, vi, troff and such makes them much more productive in the
long run. The best example is in editorial, where everyone uses vi
to prepare articles for layout. It would take so much longer if
they used a word processor instead of vi. People like Darcy Whitman
(Managing Editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>) who have
been with us a long time are proof of this.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So
GUI computing is secondary at <i  >Linux Journal</i>. For the most part, the
company runs in command-line mode.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Yes, but I'm not
saying GUI computing is bad, just that it isn't always the
solution. My big concern is that it is changing the way people
think. Rather than looking at a problem and logically addressing
it, I see people deciding that a spreadsheet is the solution to
every problem because all they understand is spreadsheets.</p><p>Or, to go back to a common analogy, everything looks like a
nail if the only tool you have is a hammer. You can keep adding
features to your hammer, but you still have a hammer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I see it as something
like auto mechanics. You can do so much more if you know how the
computer really works. And too few people do, just as too few
people know how a car works. I think a UNIX jock looks at the OS in
the same way a mechanically inclined driver looks at a car. If
problems develop, chances are they're exposed and fixable.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: It's exactly the same
thing. You can even continue down this same line with the car. You
don't have to understand physics to drive a car, but if you do, you
will be better prepared to deal with situations such as when you
are driving on slick pavement.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: One of the virtues of a
Linux box running a GUI such as KDE or GNOME is that you can go
into terminal mode and work in the command line. You can't do that
with Windows. And you can't do that with a Macintosh, although the
next version of the Mac GUI will sit on open-source BSD with a mach
kernel and command-line access. If you want, you can open a shell,
get in there and do real computing stuff. I'll be interested in
seeing if that makes any difference in the marketplace. Apple is
already quietly running some of its heavy web servers on the new
OS. This may be the result of Steve Jobs spending ten years in the
UNIX world at NeXT.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: You can get a shell on
a Windows box, but there are many fewer capabilities and a lot less
sophistication than with Linux. I seldom use Windows, but every
time I do, the first thing I do is bring up a shell in case I want
to do anything real, which I define as removing a file, moving a
file, copying a file...you get the idea. Note that the most common
thing I end up doing is copying files to floppy disks so I can take
them to a Linux system and use tools such as sed and awk to work on
them. vi isn't a problem; I always put vi on Windows boxes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I
remember <i  >Linux Journal</i> growing out of an e-mail conversation&mdash;which
I was improbably part of&mdash;about starting a free-software magazine.
A couple of questions here: 1) who else was in that original group?
and 2) what exactly happened?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: In 1993, I had an idea
to do a free-software magazine. While SSC was doing pocket
references for UNIX and UNIX-related programs, I decided I wanted
to do this magazine independent of SSC. There were six or seven of
us involved in talking about the original idea. Early players
included Arnold Robbins, author of some of SSC's products; Laurie
Tucker, a friend in Atlanta; Gerry Hammons, a longtime friend and
co-worker from years before; David Keppel, a UW computer science
grad student; and Melinda McBride, another co-worker from a
previous job.</p><p>I had set up a mailing list so we could all keep in touch.
One day, I realized that to do a good free-software magazine, you
would have to be like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Consumer Reports</em></span> and
have no advertising. I did a little arithmetic, and realized we
were about $9,999,900 US short of the $10 million I estimated it
would take to start the magazine. I posted to our list what I
initially thought was a joke: why don't we just cover Linux?</p><p>Everyone thought it was a great idea. So, I decided to think
seriously about it, and agreed. It had balance: it wouldn't cost
much to do, but there wasn't much market, either. Not sure if that
was good balance, but it was balance.</p><p>I posted some questions on comp.os.linux, the only Linux
Usenet newsgroup at the time, and received very favorable
responses. Thus, it looked like we had an audience, so I set the
wheels in motion.</p><p>Things looked pretty good, and we were almost ready to dive
in full-force when some disasters struck. The most significant was
that my friend Gerry died. He was doing some programming for the
infrastructure we needed, plus he was going to invest. It was
obvious that we needed to put the project on hold, and I made
another Usenet post to let people know there was a very large bump
in the road.</p><p>At the time, Bob Young had started a publication called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>New York UNIX</em></span>. Someone saw the post about our
problems, and gave it to Bob. Bob contacted me, and suggested that
he could be publisher if I could take on the task of editor. We
decided to go for it.</p><p>After two issues, it was clear to both Bob and me that this
wasn't the right relationship. We split the responsibilities, with
him assuming the debt for printing already done, and I took the
subscription obligation&mdash;the 926 readers who had paid for 10 to 12
more issues of the magazine. I rolled <i  >Linux Journal</i> into SSC, and we ran with it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So it's true you gave
Bob Young his start with Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Yes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: That checks out. When I
talked to Bob a couple weeks ago, he gave you all kinds of credit
for getting his Linux career started. When I told him &ldquo;Phil says
he taught you how to spell Linux&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;It's true! I owe a
lot to Phil. He even gave me one of my favorite metaphors: that
closed source is like a car with the hood welded shut.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: While he gives me
credit for the hood metaphor, I really don't remember using it.
But, I do like it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
One of the most interesting things to me about <i  >Linux Journal</i> is how
it seems to be written, to a large extent, like Linux itself. Many
of the features and columns come from readers&mdash;members of the Linux
community. And most of these are people solving real problems. I
get a sense with both Linux and <i  >Linux Journal</i>
that we're all working together to raise a barn.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: It has exactly that
feeling. In the early days, many authors were surprised that we
actually paid them to write for us. Some just donated the money to
the Free Software Foundation or other projects.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
Y'know, the e-world is full of all these new acronyms around
commerce: B2B for business-to-business, B2C for
business-to-consumer, B2E for business-to-enterprise. So I have an
acronym for <i  >Linux Journal</i>: G2G for geek-to-geek. Because that's the
model that is making the new world, and the great irony is that the
New Economy folks haven't got a clue about it. Which makes it that
much more subversive.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: This isn't new.
Remember, UNIX was born because 30 years ago, a couple of geeks
wanted to play a computer game. I wonder if 30 years from now, most
people will not even know that Linux was a student project.
Actually, I wonder how many don't know that now.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How do you see the
free/open movement today? How has it changed? Is it for the
better?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: There are two things
here: open and free. We had open and free software on mainframes in
the '60s and '70s. If you bought a mainframe, it came with an
operating system complete with source code. When you were shelling
out millions of dollars for the computer, or more commonly, leasing
a multi-million-dollar computer system, why not give you the code?
It wasn't like you would go to Radio Shack, buy another computer
and copy the OS.</p><p>A combination of the price drop in hardware, generic hardware
and Amdahl Corporation forced a change. First, Gene Amdahl, who had
designed IBM's mainframes, started his own company to make machines
like the IBM mainframes. By &ldquo;like&rdquo;, I mean they had the same
instruction set and could, therefore, run the same operating
system. IBM now had to unbundle and charge for copies of the OS so
they could make money off the sales to Amdahl users.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I've never heard this
analysis before. It's really fascinating. What you're saying is
that, historically at least, software really did want to be free.
And Bill Gates invented an industry that didn't need to be there.
This is what Neal Stephenson suggests in his great little book, In
the Beginning Was the Command Line.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Yes. The OS was
something the computer manufacturer had to include with their
hardware. Without it, they couldn't sell the hardware.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You think IBM is going
back in that direction with Linux? They're communicating rather
clearly that they don't much give a shit anymore about selling
OSes, maybe because that was never the idea in the first place.
They sell iron. Why not sell iron that's easier to deploy because
it runs a universal OS?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Yes, I do. IBM
abandoned their web server in favor of Apache. I think they know
people don't want to buy an OS&mdash;they want to buy a solution.
Actually, I think they knew this when the PC came out. I feel that
Microsoft managed to confuse the issue, and IBM fell for it for a
while.</p><p>The first cheap and generic computer was the IBM PC. Other
manufacturers jumped on the bandwagon to make inexpensive clones.
That meant the OS cost, again, could not be bundled with the
hardware cost. Besides the end of &ldquo;free&rdquo; in terms of price, the
openness of the past was gone because there was direct
competition.</p><p>The GPL is an attempt to force freedom back into the mix. It
is only one example, with the BSD license being another. Each has
its advantages and disadvantages; my point is that we used to have
this freedom, but because hardware changed, we now had to do
something different in order to get free&mdash;both in terms of price
and freedom&mdash;back into computing.</p><p>Explaining the BSD license to a businessperson is fairly
easy. They will remain skeptical, but it is easy to tell them you
can get something for free, do whatever you want with it and then
sell it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Because you have to
credit only the originator.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Exactly. You can build
a proprietary product, and don't have to pass along your additions
or improvements. The GPL is a lot harder. They don't understand why
it makes sense to make the changes and then give them away. Or that
they are expected to give away whatever changes they make. In other
words, not to act like they own it exclusively.</p><p>Context is the issue. It's the same as IBM giving you the OS
with the hardware; you need to show that businessperson how giving
away the OS will sell something else. Sorta like giving away a
keychain at the car dealer, and then hoping you buy a car to go
with it.</p><p>As each new vendor enters the Linux space, you need to
educate them. You need to show them success stories. Eventually,
they will get it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I remember when the Net
first became obvious to business, right after Netscape released the
next incarnation of Mosaic. Nobody knew what to do with it, because
no company owned it. The thing was as free and open as air. Now, it
seems like every business on earth has .com after their name, and
the Net has utterly changed the context of their work. Are we
seeing the same thing happening with Linux? It seems to me that the
Net and Linux are two aspects of the same thing&mdash;a new world that
works for three reasons: 1) nobody owns it, 2) everybody can use
it, and 3) anybody can improve on it. This turns out to be great
for business, as long as the business doesn't try to throttle this
public goose that lays golden eggs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: There is certainly a
similar evolution. That is, Linux was ignored by many for a long
time, even though it really was viable. A few years ago, SCO did a
fax spam about how you could get a $50 trade-in on your Linux
distribution to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; to SCO UNIX. Well, anyone using Linux
at the time was aware that Linux was a better product than SCO
UNIX. It's pretty obvious this effort didn't work, as we can tell
by SCO's market share.</p><p>So, yeah, Linux is a tool that can make money for a lot of
different people, because it is open and free. Many companies have
played along very well to help the goose continue to produce the
eggs. The one company I believe got off track for a while was Red
Hat. They seemed to want to make their name mean Linux. It wasn't
that they did not continue to give back to the Linux community; the
problem was their marketing wasn't showing Red Hat consumers that
there was a lot more to the Linux community than Red Hat. Sorta
like Microsoft trying to make people think that they were the only
game in town.</p><p>At this point, I think the situation has corrected itself.
You see books on SuSE, Caldera, Debian and other flavors of Linux
in the stores. That means the distributions can compete on how well
they fit the needs of each consumer, rather than on a visibility
issue.</p><p>Is this change for the better? If you believe Linux should
grow in market share, yes. We used to be a bunch of geeks doing
what we want. Today, Linux is business, and to keep it growing, we
need to keep getting more businesspeople on board. It is just that
along the way, there will be various frustrations. The most common
is when a vendor doesn't understand the point of open, and finds a
way to get around licensing such as the GPL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: I've found it very hard
to talk rationally about Microsoft inside the Linux world. Too many
distinctions get collapsed. For example, the literal distinctions
between open and closed source get collapsed with moral
distinctions between right and wrong, and with qualitative
distinctions between good and bad software. Eric Raymond is fond of
saying he just likes software that doesn't suck. But a lot of the
world likes closed-source software for which there are no
alternatives, whether that software sucks or not. And most
Microsoft users, on the whole, don't think Office sucks.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I think two things
happened here. First, for many people, the first word processor
they used was Microsoft Word. They learned it, and see anything
different as something new they have to learn. So, whether MS Word
is sucky or not, they know how to use it. When I was learning vi, I
had been using ned, a screen-oriented editor on UNIX, but then ned
wasn't available for the new computer SSC had bought. I hated vi
and loved ned. What happened, however, was in about two weeks,
while I still hated vi, I realized I was editing faster than had
ever been possible with ned.</p><p>The second is the charm of the GUI. Microsoft had the &ldquo;in&rdquo;
that allowed it to produce the best GUI-based editor, because they
had the inside track on the GUI. For the casual user&mdash;someone who
might write a letter a day&mdash;Word was adequate, and easier to
remember how to use. Even I can use Word; it's just that I can get
more work done in vi.</p><p>The person I started SSC with, Irene Pasternack, left to
&ldquo;get a life&rdquo; that included raising a family&mdash;something you don't
want to do when you are starting a company. Irene has consulted at
Microsoft for close to 15 years doing tech writing. A year or so
after she went to work for Microsoft, her boss told her that she
did eight times as much work as his other employees and asked if
she had any idea why. She said, &ldquo;they use Microsoft Word, I use
vi.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: A friend of mine used
to program for a familiar dot-com company that runs on Windows NT.
He said he constantly had to deal with memory leaks in that OS, and
added, &ldquo;we're putting up 60-story buildings and we don't know if
there's rebar in the concrete.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;Actually, we know
there isn't rebar in the concrete, and we're going ahead anyway,
knowing we just have to fix problems constantly.&rdquo; Open-source
software doesn't put geeks out of business; it just gives them more
room to do their business. And gradually, Linux is proving that.
Which is why I think that in five or ten years, the software and
construction businesses will look very similar, with many more
builders, architects and designers. Plus many more suppliers. The
main difference will be that no one pre-fab supplier will control
the business anymore.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: The UNIX community
grew up as computer capabilities grew up. The 30-year history of
UNIX means there were people making those buildings without
foundations, because there wasn't any room for the foundation. But
they recognized the problem, and when room became available, they
added as much foundation as would fit. Thus, the best possible
building was produced at each step along the way, and we built a
workforce of people who understood how to grow with industry
changes.</p><p>On the other hand, the Microsoft community knew the
foundation was missing and there was nothing they could do about
it, so they realized the whole building was disposable. Of course,
being disposable means you can sell the new product next year. I
think I am beginning to realize that the mess being created was not
a plot&mdash;just circumstance.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You've probably watched
the climbing Linux adoption curve closer than anybody. Why is Linux
finding universal adoption where other free UNIX systems (such as
the BSDs) did not?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: As much as Richard
Stallman and others would like to credit this adoption with the
difference between the GPL and the other software licenses, I just
don't think it is the case. Linux got out there, and it worked.
While the various BSD camps were fighting over which was the one
true BSD, people were using Linux and seeing that it was a
solution.</p><p>Once Linux had the inertia (and <i  >Linux Journal</i> certainly helped build that inertia), Linux
would continue to roll along. I also have to give a lot of credit
to Linus' management skills. Getting hundreds, possibly thousands,
of programmers around the world all to cooperate on the development
was an amazing effort. Getting them all to do it for free was way
beyond amazing.</p><p>Even before I met Linus, I was impressed by his maturity and
sobriety. The guy just seemed to have this highly informed and calm
perspective, like a judge. Not your average 20-something dude; not
your average geek, either. Made me wonder what would have happened,
say, if Bill Joy had stayed with Berkeley UNIX. Instead, Bill is
doing fun stuff, but it's all stuff that's owned by Sun. Java.
Gini. Solaris. Sun is a good company, but in their own way, they're
as closed as Microsoft.</p><p>Linus has introduced a new model to the computer industry.
Or, maybe I should say that Richard Stallman proposed a new model,
and Linus was the right man to successfully implement it. In any
case, it has worked, and that may help convince companies such as
Sun to at least move in the direction of more openness.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: When did you meet
Linus?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I first met Linus in
1994. It was at a Linux-related party in suburban Washington, DC.
When I got there, Linus was there along with a few others. They
were talking about some technical Linux-related issues. What I saw
was a person who could participate in the conversation, rather than
act as the boss. At this point, I understood why Linux was moving
forward so rapidly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
Linux has spread like wildfire, and <i  >Linux Journal</i> has grown right
along with it. How have both Linux and <i  >Linux Journal</i> changed since both came out at v.1.0? And are
you happy with all those changes?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: The short answer is
that today we are both better products. But, more importantly, our
focuses have changed. Linux went from a geek OS to a major
contender in the business and commercial market. As that was
happening, <i  >LJ</i> went from being a developer
magazine to offering a lot more that would appeal to the commercial
user.</p><p>Over the years, we have received letters from readers who
credit <i  >LJ</i> with convincing their bosses that
Linux was real. At times, I felt <i  >LJ</i> was
portraying a more professional image than Linux itself; at other
times, I felt it was the other way around.</p><p>I can't say I am happy with all the changes, but I also
realize they needed to happen. While it used to be more fun to play
with Linux than to publish a magazine, I also realize that for
Linux to move forward, it is necessary for it to become more
commercial. We would not be seeing drivers for all the new hardware
if we didn't have the kind of growth we have.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: In the last year, Linux
has become a very hot topic. It seems to me this was for two
reasons. One was the popularity of the OS itself. The other was the
popularity of new Linux companies in the stock market. These are
two very separate concerns that were covered by the mainstream
press as if they were one&mdash;at least while Linux stocks were hot.
Now we're seeing the topics start to separate a bit, now that
dot-coms of all kinds (including Linux stocks) are dropping from
the sky like a plague of frogs. Linux stocks were especially hard
hit. It hardly seems fair.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: The growth in the
popularity of the OS has been amazing. Here, I think the U.S.
Department of Justice and Microsoft both get some credit. The DOJ
antitrust suit against Microsoft brought the concept of an
operating system into the minds of much of the public. Prior to the
DOJ action, most people only understood &ldquo;computer&rdquo; and
&ldquo;program&rdquo; together, where &ldquo;program&rdquo; was commonly spelled
Microsoft Word. They bought a computer, and added Microsoft Word or
Microsoft Office in order to make it do things. That's all very
different today.</p><p>The Microsoft credit has to do with NT/Windows 2000. A lot of
companies were betting on NT or Windows 2000 offering the server
side of their computing. The harder people look at these products
now, the more they seem to realize there are alternatives such as
Linux, and quite bluntly, Linux has proven to be a better
choice.</p><p>Windows 2000 is finally out there, but people are sick of
waiting. If Windows 2000 works, fine. But if not, they are likely
to pick an alternative, and Linux seems to be at the top of that
list.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
Here at <i  >Linux Journal</i> we use Debian, which is the largest
noncommercial distribution. Are we doing it for agnostic reasons
(not wanting to favor any particular advertiser), because it's
better, or both?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Note that we used to
use Slackware. I like the idea that Debian seemed to be the best
fit for us, because we can then be agnostic, but we chose it mostly
because it was a better solution. Debian has always had a good
dependency system, plus it was designed so you could upgrade
without a reboot. While Debian development might fall behind the
commercial distributions, I am not a fan of upgrades without a
reason, so it has tended to keep up with our needs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: What do you run
personally?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: On my personal
systems, I run a whole bunch of different distributions for various
reasons. For example, I have SuSE on one laptop and Caldera on
another.</p><p>Linux, the kernel and hundreds of utility programs are
virtually the same in all the distributions. Sure, SuSE will
release a new distribution this week with a newer kernel than Red
Hat. And next week, Caldera will be ahead, and so on. But they are
mostly the same.</p><p>What they add to all this GPLed software is a combination of
additional programs, such as an evaluation copy of some commercial
software, and an installation method. All the distributions I have
seen differentiate between GPLed software and commercial software,
so I don't see this as a serious issue. As for the installation
methods, most distributions have GPLed this code as well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Let's talk about Linux
on the desktop. Today, there still isn't a single non-proprietary
desktop application suite to compete with Microsoft Office.
Enterprise-customer types tell me Linux won't make it on the
desktop until it has a truly competitive (and compatible) office
suite. What will break the logjam here?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: StarOffice, while not
open source, is free and is forcing the issue of compatibility.
Sun, the owner of StarOffice, needs a generic and compatible office
suite in order to restrict Microsoft's ability to rewrite the
standard every year or two. If StarOffice is successful in
preventing the standards rewrite, then I expect other packages will
appear. The good news is that StarOffice is available for MS
Windows; and, as I understand it, e-machines is shipping it on
their boxes. This should help market penetration.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: If you see Sun as the
only player with the clout to really compete with Microsoft in
office suites, what do you make of Applix's and Corel's chances?
And do you think it's possible that some group of open-source
developers, KDE for example, will come up with a practical
open-source office suite?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Corel doesn't have a
complete suite yet, and I don't think they will until after the
issue has been forced anyway. Applix has had an office suite out
there for a long time, but I don't think they have the clout
needed. Sun wins on image.</p><p>Linux will creep into the office desktop on a
company-by-company basis. Take a bank, for example. While there are
lots of computers in banks, they don't do a lot of different tasks.
Armed with a word processor, a spreadsheet and some program to
access their proprietary software running on a server, you could
quickly convert a bank over to Linux desktops. This will happen
because of cost issues.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: This is what lots of
people want to see with Linux appliances. Should be interesting to
see how that goes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: Besides cost, the ease
with which you can add things to Linux and the fact that Linux for
an appliance can be made really small are two more pluses in favor
of Linux in this market. As much as BeOS is a great OS, I think it
is going to be hard for Be, Inc. in this market because of
Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do you give Be much of
a chance in any case? How about if they open source the OS?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: I think they bailed
out of the desktop at the wrong time. For some high-end IAs, they
may have a market, but I don't see them getting any significant
percentage. Qt without X (this is new) makes Linux more viable
here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Let's talk about loves
&amp; hates. Why do you hate Perl and love Python? Why do you hate
Emacs and love vi? These are often religious issues, but I'm
interested in what makes for wise and forward choices.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span>: They generally are
religious issues. In the days of less-powerful computers, you could
make the argument that vi is small and Emacs is a pig, but today it
doesn't matter. I learned vi in 1983. I don't even think about
which keys to hit to do a task&mdash;it is just magic now. I have no
reason to change.</p><p>A newcomer should try both. Some people, for example, really
can't handle a moded editor like vi. Others see the advantage of
fewer keystrokes. Yes, we have an office full of vi users, but I
expect some places have offices full of Emacs users.</p><p>Perl vs. Python is different. Historically, Perl evolved from
UNIX commands such as sed and awk, whereas Python was designed.
Python was designed to be an object-oriented language, whereas OOP
features were tacked on to Perl. If you are an old UNIX programmer,
then Perl may make sense to you; but for a non-UNIX person, I can't
see it.</p></div></div>
