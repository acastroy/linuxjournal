    Meeting Room Booking System, W3M, tradeclient and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fa580.0x28f26b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Well, I'm really excited about the new
kernel. The netfilter software (iptables) which replaces ipchains
(I know, yet another packet filter to learn, but it's not that bad,
really) will save me from having to configure both ipchains and
ipmasqadm (at least for those systems doing port forwarding as well
as packet filtering). I have more and more clients all the time who
seem to need this capability. Combining these two (basically NAT
and packet filtering) into one integrated bundle will make
administration easier. And ease of administration is where I win
clients away from Microsoft. I anticipate a webmin module (a
framework consisting of modules you can add or remove) will be
available to handle the netfilter rules (even if I have to write it
myself, and no one, not even me wants that&mdash;at least, not if you've
ever seen my Perl code). And the fact that the new netfilter also
includes support for IPv6 is icing on the cake. I'm constantly
amazed at the pace of improvements, not just in the kernel, but in
all the software available for Linux today, as can be seen by
looking at newer versions of past FOS software highlights.
</p><p>Meeting Room Booking System:
<a href="http://mrbs.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>I know of several places that could use a good meeting room
booking system. I've seen a couple that work well, but this one
certainly deserves a look. It really doesn't matter where the room
to be reserved is; MRBS handles it very nicely. Multi-hour events
are handled well, and the overall look is appealing. It requires a
web server with php3, MySQL and a web browser.</p><p>W3M:
<a href="http://ei5nazha.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~aito/w3m/eng" target="_self">http://ei5nazha.yz.yamagata-u.ac.jp/~aito/w3m/eng/</a></p><p>My favorite browser has always been Lynx. It's fast, and I've
always built it with SSL. But it doesn't support frames. This has
always been somewhat annoying, especially given the number of sites
that use frames. Well, w3m supports tables and frames. The frames
are handled by converting them to tables and displaying them as
such. I was also pleased to see that you could compile in mouse
support, colors and SSL. In fact, you could choose the build size,
which determined the particular options, or choose a custom build
to mix-and-match options. On the downside, I did find that in an
xterm, I had to either vary the width of the xterm or scroll
across. On a VT, you can only scroll (unless you already have a
wide page via frame buffers). This can be annoying if you're used
to Lynx automatically sizing to the screen. But that's due to the
use of tables, so it is the price you have to pay. I requires
(depending on the build size you choose) libm, libgpm, libnsl,
libncurses, glibc and openssl (for SSL sites).</p><p>tradeclient:
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tradeclient" target="_self">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tradeclient/</a></p><p>It slices, it dices, it keeps your Calendar, ToDo list,
Addressbook, it makes coffee and pays your bills (okay, so it won't
pay your bills). I showed this to a client, and their first
reaction was: When did Microsoft port Outlook to Linux? Well, I'm
afraid I don't know Outlook from Adam (and for that matter, I have
had the singular pleasure of not having to work with anything
Microsoft in almost a year), but I do know this mail client
includes everything but the kitchen sink (if you consider that a
plus) and has a very pleasing interface. Try it if you like the
&ldquo;no need for any other software&rdquo; approach to programs. It
requires libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libm and glibc.</p><p>webmail.pl:
<a href="http://opensource.jaos.org" target="_self">http://opensource.jaos.org/</a></p><p>If you need a good web-mail client that won't strain your
resources, this is one you'll want to take a look at. It doesn't
have an address book, or folders for saving messages; in fact, it
doesn't have much of anything. What it does have is a good-looking
interface to read and send mail, period. Perfect for an ISP short
on resources. It requires Perl, a web browser, a web server with
Perl support, Perl modules: CGI, Mail::POP3Client, Socket,
MIME::Base64 and Crypt::Blowfish.</p><p>linuxinfo:
<a href="http://www.tahallah.clara.com.uk/programming/prog.html" target="_self">www.tahallah.clara.com.uk/programming/prog.html</a></p><p>For this program, the three-line output says it all: Linux
chiriqui.pananix.com 2.4.0-test2 #2 Sat Jun 24 16:19:55 EST 2000
One Intel Unknown 333MHz processor, 665.19 total bogomips, 128M RAM
System library 2.1.3. You can even use it in a server-parsed web
page (.shtml) by using the following line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!--#exec cmd="/usr/local/bin/linuxinfo" --&gt;
</pre><p>Since the output doesn't contain any html commands, you might
want to surround the above line with &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; tags,
and perhaps even center tags. It requires glibc.
</p><p>ftpgrab (download only):
<a href="ftp://ftp.lmh.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/ftpgrab-0.1.2.tar.gz" target="_self">ftp.lmh.ox.ac.uk/pub/linux/ftpgrab-0.1.2.tar.gz</a></p><p>Another site-mirror program that currently supports only ftp,
but HTTP support is planned. This one is different, in that instead
of mirroring all files, ftpgrab will mirror only the latest file
version by parsing the version number. This can be very
resource-saving if you have sufficient file space for only the
latest version. It downloads the most current, then deletes the
older one. This can be quite a savings with files like gtk+ and
others. It requires libpthread, libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p>quizzy:
<a href="http://www.soomka.com" target="_self">http://www.soomka.com/</a></p><p>Okay, maybe you don't need any more tests in your life, given
all the tests out there already (LPI, A+, etc.). But if you can
find some sample questions, you can test yourself. Questions are
simple to add to a file. The program even comes with a script to
add questions, although the author suggests using vi. It's multiple
choice only, no fill in the blanks, but you can have multiple
correct answers (the number of required answers is shown). The
program doesn't yet save scores, so you'll need to note your score
before leaving the screen. The &ldquo;examinee&rdquo; can also cheat. But the
instant feedback on right/wrong can be instructional. It requires
libncurses, libmenu and glibc.</p><p>scanlogd:
<a href="http://www.openwall.con/scanlogd" target="_self">http://www.openwall.con/scanlogd/</a></p><p>Want to monitor port scans on your systems without the
complexity of PortSentry? This logs all port scans. With the
proliferation of juveniles who have nothing better to do than run
nmap and other scans against networks and systems the world over,
this can give you an idea of how much of a target you are. It's
only one tool, but a good one. It requires glibc.</p></div></div>
