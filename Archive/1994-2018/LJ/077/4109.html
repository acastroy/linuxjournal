so breathtaking, so absolutely amazing, that it changes the world.
Linux 2.4 still isn't one of those things. Linus' rapid-release
plan didn't actually rapidly produce a new kernel, not at the rate
many developers (myself included) expected. This article is an
addendum to &ldquo;The Bullet Points&rdquo; (January 2000) and a followup to
&ldquo;Linux 2.4 Spotlight: ISA Plug-and-Play&rdquo; (February 2000). For a
more complete rundown of Linux 2.4, see &ldquo;Linux 2.4 Scorecard&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Wonderful World of Linux 2.4&rdquo;, available on Linux Today
(<a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com" target="_self">www.linuxtoday.com</a>).</p><p>Linux 2.2 took just over a month during its &ldquo;pre-&rdquo; stage,
ditto with 2.0. While the 2.4 kernel is in the final development
cycle, this pre-series has been extended several months and it's
still difficult to predict how long it will take for the official
release. The 2.2 kernel had some &ldquo;brown bag&rdquo; problems that I'm
sure Linus would not be interested in repeating. According to the
recent 2.4 bug list, there were 12 very important bugs that need
fixing in the current pre-releases, 26 less important ones, several
more minor minor ones, lots of things to merge and verify and other
similar things. This list grows smaller daily, but it's still a big
list.</p><p>Alan Cox's recent work on the &ldquo;ac&rdquo; series of kernels has
helped to stabilize the code, but a number of items remain on the
&ldquo;must fix&rdquo; list. I expect 2.4 to be released in a couple of
months. The actual date of release, however will be entirely up to
Linus.</p><p>And now, in no particular order, more of the new features of
Linux 2.4.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128e558"></a>DevFS: The Device Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>Nearly every variant of UNIX accesses block and character
devices through a common model: special device files in the /dev
directory. Unfortunately, different UNIX variants name these
devices in drastically different ways. BSD variations, for
instance, refer to hard disks as /dev/wd* instead of /dev/hd*. (The
characters &ldquo;wd&rdquo; stand for Western Digital, the manufacturer of
IDE hard disks.) Unlike Linux, some UNIX variants use the /dev
directory for network devices, too (e.g., eth0).</p><p>Although the naming of devices is different across UNIX
variants, the method of how these devices communicate with the
kernel is generally the same. Under Linux 2.2, special files
(device nodes) for each accessible device are placed in the /dev
directory. The device nodes are just two values, a major and minor
number. The major number generally correspond to a driver or
subsystem in the Linux kernel. The minor numbers generally
corresponds to a sub-function or sub-device (e.g., a specific
partition on a hard disk). Communication is actually done with
these numbers. The names of the device nodes are standardized, but
could be called anything an administrator wanted. (All Linux
distributions today use the same standard naming scheme provided as
a document with the kernel.)</p><p>There are several shortcomings of the 2.2 /dev model. First
off, it uses a finite numeric name-space. Inevitably, we run out of
numbers naming new devices in the standard. Second, modern devices
(such as USB) don't lay well against a major/minor arrangement.
Even complicated partitioning schemes reveal limitations in the
current infrastructure. As it's impossible to know in advance which
devices a user will install on their system, distributions create
hundreds (sometimes more than a thousand) of device nodes in the
/dev directory. Only a handful are used on a given machine; the
rest remain to satisfy all possible configurations of all
compatible hardware devices. It's a bit crazy, when you think about
it. To better meet the demands of a more plug-and-play world, Linux
2.4 introduces the Device Filesystem (DevFS): in an elegant
reworking of /dev, only configured devices are listed.</p><p>DevFS is a kernel-based file system. Like /proc, DevFS is
seen in the filesystem tree (as /dev) but never gets &ldquo;synced&rdquo; to
a physical device; /dev stays in RAM. Whenever a driver is loaded
into the kernel and the device is detected, appropriate entries are
added to the /dev tree.</p><p>Besides cleaning out the file system tree, DevFS will be
faster, too. Here's how it works. Communication is direct; when you
open() a file, you are communicating directly with the driver.
Under 2.2, when a normal device node is open()ed, the kernel looks
up the major device number in a table and calls a function. The
actual driver then works out the specific device using the minor
number. DevFS removes a layer of indirection. Now programs talk to
drivers, not nodes.</p><p>With the introduction of DevFS and deprecation of device
nodes, Linus has decided 2.2 device nodes are too limiting and
going the way of the dodo. Nearly all DevFS node names are
different than their major/minor counterparts, usually very
different. Device classes are now categorized in subdirectories
(structurally similar to /proc/scsi/*). For compatibility with 2.2
systems, administrators may still use old-style nodes (with the
devfsd d&lt;\#230&gt;mon), but they are deprecated.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are some problems with DevFS as well.
The permissions are more difficult to manage in the new system.
Device permissions are allocated by the drivers, rather than by
nodes in the file system. Changes to permissions can be made, but
they are forgotten each time the module is loaded (or on reboot).
Drivers (part of the kernel) name themselves, hence controlling the
naming conventions and /dev layout, hence setting policy which is
considered a bad thing. You can move (or rename) DevFS files after
boot, or change their permissions, but you start with the kernel's
policy. (Scripts are available to record the state of /dev at
shutdown.) Presently, it's not clear which routines the
distributions will use, or if they will even use DevFS. DevFS is
still &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;, after all, though that may change before
release.</p><p>While setting policy in the kernel is considered a bad thing,
the many wins of the DevFS model have convinced Linus that the new
way is the right way. Work is being done to make DevFS more
&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; to administrators stung by its downsides&mdash;some of this
is likely to make its way into the kernel before Linux 2.4
officially ships.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128e8c8"></a>Logical Volume Manager (LVM)</h2></div></div><p>Another semi-revolutionary change made to Linux 2.4 involves
the way it handles disks and partitions. Previous versions of Linux
were somewhat limited in the way disks and partitions were used.
Like most other operating systems, Linux sat directly on the
standard hardware partition scheme. Using fdisk or a similar tool,
you would create partitions that would be formatted as &ldquo;Linux
swap&rdquo; or &ldquo;ext2&rdquo;. These partitions are difficult to change once
in place, however. Resizing or moving a partition was almost
impossible, even for power users.</p><p>Previous versions of Linux include the &ldquo;multiple device&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;md&rdquo;) driver, which allows Linux administrators to
concatenate partitions and do more complicated maneuvers to create
software RAID arrays. Using this driver and some footwork, it is
possible to extend the native partition scheme somewhat, but not to
the level of flexibility required by many applications.</p><p>The Logical Volume Manager has the power to make the Linux
world a more flexible place. (Just as with the md driver, other
OSes generally won't be able to understand Linux's LVM scheme.)
Instead of dividing disks into static partitions, the LVM allows a
Linux user to concatenate several physical disk devices into a
single &ldquo;volume group&rdquo;. These groups can then be partitioned into
multiple &ldquo;logical volumes&rdquo;. The LVM allows volumes to be resized
(with certain constraints) and moved. More disks can be added to
volume groups on the fly, allowing for massive storage
capacity&mdash;the sky is almost literally the limit. The LVM subsystem
is not new to the commercial UNIX world; the code is modeled partly
from its implementation in Tru64 UNIX, HPUX and other commercial
UNIX systems.</p><p>As an added bonus of this effort, code to resize ext2
partitions has been released to the public. While this code lives
out in user space, far away from the kernel, it is a very important
component of the LVM subsystem. Even when used without the LVM
subsystem, it will no doubt be used in the next generation of
installation programs and fdisk-like utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128ead8"></a>Bigger and Better</h2></div></div><p>Linux 2.4 has been through several major and minor stumbles
on its way to becoming suitable for very large environments. The
hardware is largely to blame for the difficulty. i386 hardware
(being 32-bit and somewhat archaic) cannot easily support huge
files and other requirements of a 64-bit operating system. This is
a limitation of the hardware, and not a limitation with Linux
itself. With the growing popularity of NT on i386 hardware, there
has been a push to get 64-bit Linux on i386 too&mdash;a push to raise
the bar where Linux can, to overcome the limitations of the
platform without sacrificing the cleanliness and speed of the
current implementation. Two major improvements in this area really
stand out: more users per system and very large files.</p><p>First, one feature literally demanded by enterprise is 32-bit
user and group IDs (UID and GID). In the Linux and UNIX worlds,
every user is given a unique number. Unfortunately, the numeric
system is finite and a limit of 65,000 users is constricting in
some applications (i.e., a high-volume web hosting site like
Geocities or Tripod or an ISP will have scaling issues when they
gain 65,000 users). Linux 2.4 bumps the limit up to about 4.3
billion. For comparison, the population of the world is just over 6
billion. [Almost enough for everybody to have an account on every
single computer!  &mdash;Ed.]</p><p>Along with this trend of bigger and better, Linux 2.4 raises
another ceiling: maximum file size. Previous incarnations of Linux
would choke on files larger than 2GB, despite the fact that the
underlying file system could theoretically handle it. Although many
people may not immediately see the benefit of having incredibly
large files, this feature is especially useful for managing
information or media&mdash;imagine tarring all your MP3s into one
convenient file, or putting them in a database.</p><p>It should be stressed that while Linux 2.4 will allow for
bigger and better applications, one of the main concerns of the
development team has always been to optimize for the common case:
real users. To this end, the code has been carefully designed in
such a way as to affect real users the absolute least possible.
While these features will be assets to the users who need them,
they will not be a stumbling block for users who don't.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128ece8"></a>New Ports: ia64, SuperH, S/390</h2></div></div><p>One benefit of the open-source methodology of development is
that it is perfectly reasonable for one to &ldquo;fork&rdquo; a copy of the
kernel and do their own development on the fork. This method is
often employed by kernel hackers who want to plod off and do their
own thing for a while without having to pay careful attention to
the other developments. As it turns out, however, these changes
must eventually be integrated into the &ldquo;official&rdquo; kernel to be
properly respected and supported. Although forks can be of any
type, one common area for Linux to fork-and-merge is its support
for processor families.</p><p>With the latest revision of the Linux kernel, several new
processor families are given their special place within the kernel
sources. ia64, one of the most talked-about additions to the kernel
in some time, is the future Intel processor that is supposed to be
the 64-bit replacement for the i386 line. In a sense, it's sort of
like the PPC to Motorola's m68k. Hardware for this platform is
virtually nonexistent and is not expected to reach consumers in
quantity for years. However, Linux will be there when the first
motherboards and processors roll off the assembly line. In many
ways, this is a demonstration of Linux's larger role in the
operating system market, as all previous Linux ports were done
after hardware and an alternative OS were already available.</p><p>SuperH is the embedded processor used in Pocket PC (a.k.a.
Windows CE) machines and another addition to the &ldquo;supported by
Linux&rdquo; clan. There's an irony to supporting Linux on WinCE
hardware that many users just can't help but chuckle over. Again,
this port is still in an early stage, but the developers are
chugging along.</p><p>About as far on the other end of the computing spectrum as
you can get, the S/390 will get a port, too. The S/390 is the
latest generation of IBM's mainframe line and probably the largest
variety of hardware that Linux is known to run on. Much of the port
was done by IBM; this in itself is another first for the Linux
community.</p><p>While it is true that Linux supports all of these new
processors in the official kernel source distribution, these ports
are not necessarily ready for prime time. Additionally,
pre-compiled distributions for any of these processors may be a
long way away from the &ldquo;normal user&rdquo; stage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128ef50"></a>Firewall/NAT Rewrite (iptables)</h2></div></div><p>Although I probably shouldn't admit it, I know a number of
system administrators who never bothered upgrading their kernel to
Linux 2.2. Even though Linux 2.2 included a completely rewritten
network layer, the cost of bothering to update their old (2.0 era)
scripts to the 2.2 command set was daunting to some. That being
said, Linux 2.4 has rewritten the entire networking layer (again!)
and introduced an entirely new interface: iptables. But what about
those people who don't want to upgrade again? This time around,
Linux 2.4 includes compatibility modules for both the 2.0 and the
2.2-era tools. With compatibility tools lowering the cost of entry,
it is hoped that this release of the Linux kernel will be more
readily implemented than the previous release.</p><p>The Linux 2.4 networking layer wasn't rewritten again for
nothing. Network Address Translation (NAT) and Firewall operations
have been made more flexible in their operation and split off into
separate modules. With these modules, a Linux 2.4 system becomes
nearly as powerful and flexible as modern-day commercial routing
hardware. Of course, to use the really nifty features of the new
kernel, you have to be using the &ldquo;real&rdquo; iptables interface and
not either of the compatibility interfaces provided.</p><p>While the new flexibility may be enough to convince hard-core
network people to upgrade, the 2.4 Linux kernel also includes more
general fixes and speedups for the networking layer. David Miller
and the rest of the networking gurus have been hard at work making
sure Linux 2.4 talks more efficiently to other operating systems.
The networking layer and the TCP/IP stack have been rewritten to be
more scalable on multi-processor machines. Network device drivers
are now written to make them more stable and to eliminate some
possible race conditions in the infrastructure, too. These changes
further build on the great work that was done with Linux networking
during the Linux 2.2 development cycle.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128f108"></a>Direct Rendering Manager</h2></div></div><p>Linux 2.2 included the first official support for
frame-buffer graphics devices in the kernel; Linux 2.4 also
recognizes a new interface for kernel-level control of graphic
hardware. With the introduction of Direct Rendering Manager (DRM)
comes a system to keep multiple demanding video processes in check.
Rather than being a complete video driver in itself (such things
are better left in user space), Linux 2.4 makes user-space video
more stable (and secure) by providing a kernel interface which
controls and synchronizes access to graphical devices. Supported
programs, such as Xfree4.x, will talk to this interface whenever a
hardware resource is needed. The kernel will know when multiple
programs are attempting simultaneous access to video structures,
and will save state or do whatever is necessary to make sure they
don't conflict. Since supported programs will be unable to send
conflicting requests to the graphical hardware, these conflicts
will not be able to cause a crash. This new feature is largely
geared to advanced accelerated hardware, but lower-end hardware may
benefit from the new resource allocation routines as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128f210"></a>Firewire/I2O</h2></div></div><p>One major area of improvement in Linux 2.4 is the number of
device types it supports. I already wrote about Linux 2.4's support
for USB, ISA Plug-and-Play and PC Card devices in my previous
articles. This picture would not be complete, however, without
mention of support for Firewire and I2O (Intelligent Input/Output)
devices, two relatively new additions to the PC hardware
market.</p><p>Firewire, IEEE 1394, is a high-speed external bus system that
is similar in concept to USB. (You may also hear it called by
Sony's name: i.Link.) Unlike USB, Firewire supports multiple
computers on the same bus and at higher-speed transfers than USB.
Due to the high bandwidth available, Firewire has proven most
useful for digital (video) cameras and similar devices which
require a lot of data to be transferred quickly. It should be noted
that, although the underlying bus is supported under Linux, not all
hardware chip sets and devices are supported yet. This support will
improve over time and as more hardware becomes available.</p><p>I2O is a new type of I/O subsystem that features
operating-system independence in addition to high-speed data
transfers. This means that, in theory, one driver is guaranteed to
work with all devices of a specific type, regardless of vendor or
how the device actually works internally. Unfortunately for us,
there are relatively few I2O devices made so far, and the kernel
support is still somewhat incomplete.</p><p>Although Firewire and I2O are relatively new to the Linux
sphere and relatively little hardware actually exists for these bus
types, the open-source snowball is rolling and support for these
device types will improve as these devices become more
common.</p><p><a href="4109s1.html" target="_self">Linux 2.4 Scorecard</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1196580.0x128f4d0"></a>In Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Linux 2.4 is shaping up to be the best version of Linux
yet... oh, wait, I already used the line for Linux 2.2. With many
new features for desktop and enterprise, the new kernel has
something for everyone. Bring the kids!</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Joseph Pranevich (jpranevich@lycos.com) is an
