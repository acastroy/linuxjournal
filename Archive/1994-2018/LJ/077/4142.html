non-embedded real-time applications. TimeSys, the maker of
Linux/RT, suggested several application domains where Linux/RT
could be used. Application domains suggested include industrial
automation, process control, telecommunications, web servers,
avionics and others.
</p><p>According to the vendor, the architecture of Linux/RT offers
Linux resilience and stability while running real-time
applications. To make the architecture real, TimeSys added a few
additional calls to their release of Linux and used a real-time
resource kernel (RK). As a loadable kernel module (LKM), the
real-time RK interacts with the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel
interacts with the hardware. Using this architecture, the resource
kernel can take advantage of all existing Linux hardware drivers.
Existing applications continue to interact with the Linux kernel,
while real-time applications interact with the real-time kernel
module. With this approach, the whole system will not crash if a
real-time application process hangs or crashes. It also means
pre-existing (legacy) Linux applications can run along side the
real-time application. The RK module may be loaded or unloaded like
any other LKM.</p><p>Linux/RT is packaged into three editions: Standard, Deluxe
and Professional. The Professional Edition comes with Linux/RT,
TimeTrace, and according to the web site, an evaluation copy of
TimeWiz. The review package did not contain TimeWiz. TimeSys
Linux/RT comes with two real-time environments. Linux/RT is based
upon the Carnegie Mellon University Linux resource kernel
(Linux/RK). Support for Robust Embedded (RED) Linux system event
logging is included in Linux/RT. For compatibility with
pre-existing systems, TimeSys Linux/RT includes the Real-Time
Applications Interface (RTAI). On a side note, only one of the two
real-time environments may be loaded at any one time. Figure 1
shows one of the included Linux/RT real-time sample
programs.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4142f1.large.jpg"><img src="4142f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Linux/RT Real-Time Sample
Program</p></div></div>
</p><p>According to the model, the resource kernel can reserve some
portion of CPU cycles, network bandwidth, disk bandwidth and
memory. These reserves are grouped into resource sets and assigned
to a process. Version 1.0 of Linux/RT supports several
capabilities. These include 256 fixed-priority scheduling levels,
CPU resource reservations, high-resolution clocks and timers,
periodic real-time tasks and pinning memory used by real-time
processes. The review copy of Linux/RT and manual did not appear to
support network or disk bandwidth reserves. According to the
manual, Linux/RT utility commands may be used to assign a resource
set to any Linux process. Another feature of Linux/RT is its
ability to provide a quality of service (QoS). Using Linux/RT
utility commands, real-time and legacy Linux programs can be
endowed with specific QoS levels.</p><p>TimeTrace (Standard Edition) for Linux/RT provides the
ability to visualize and profile one Linux/RT host running
real-time programs or applications. An example of the TimeTrace
interface is shown in Figure 2. TimeTrace sits on its own platform
and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) presentation of the
monitored host. With TimeTrace, you can view scheduling,
context-switching, system calls and user events. According to the
vendor, TimeTrace makes your real-time task's worst-case and
average execution times, and period information, available. The
Professional Edition of TimeTrace can monitor multiple Linux/RT
hosts.</p><p>

</p><p>TimeWiz: Modeling, Analysis and Simulation tool provides the
ability to observe the behavior of a real-time program visually.
According to the vendor, this tool may be used to analyze
worst-case behaviors, simulate average-case timing, model
end-to-end performance, represent hardware and software
configurations and generate reports. As with TimeTrace, TimeWiz
sits on a Wintel platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d8580.0x21d0ef8"></a>How Hard Is It to Install?</h2></div></div><p>Linux/RT is based on the Debian distribution. A standard
Debian install process may be used for new Linux installations. The
manual says Linux/RT may also be used with non-Debian
distributions, including those of Red Hat, SuSE and Mandrake. I run
Caldera's distribution on my computer and chose to use the script
provided for installing Linux/RT on non-Debian distributions. The
non-Debian Linux install script offered custom or default installs.
The custom install offers options to select the target install
directories and to register Linux/RT with LILO. I chose to use the
default install. The install went well. Caldera 2.4 now uses GRUB
as its boot loader. Linux/RT looks for LILO, and did not recognize
GRUB. I added the Linux/RT kernel to my GRUB boot list and
rebooted. On boot-up, the default TimeSys kernel recognized my SCSI
card, SCSI devices and my Ethernet card.</p><p>TimeTrace for Linux/RT installation consists of two
installation activities. First, TimeSys Linux/RT kernel modules
must be installed on the Linux host. Second, you must instal
TimeTrace on a Windows NT/95 host. Next, two user-mode collector
files (viewrk and viewrtai) installed on the Windows host need to
be copied to the Linux/RT host(s).</p><p>TimeTrace uses traditional Windows installation methods. The
installation went smoothly once the CD was recognized by a CD-ROM
drive. I am not sure why my normal CD-ROM would hang with the
TimeTrace CD loaded. I use the same CD-ROM drive for all my CD
install media. On a lark, I tried my DVD drive. The install CD was
recognized immediately. The TimeTrace manual did not suggest any
particular Linux/RT file system location for the two collector
files that needed to be copied to the Linux platform. I noticed
several other RK utility files were placed in the /usr/local/bin
directory. So, it seemed like a natural place to put these two
files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d8580.0x21d10b0"></a>How Hard Is It to Use?</h2></div></div><p>Using Linux/RT kernel modules, RTAI or TimeTrace involves
issuing a couple of commands. For Linux/RT, it is a matter of
loading or unloading some Linux kernel modules. Using TimeTrace
presumes a real-time application is already running on the Linux
box and the proper user-mode collector program is running as
well.</p><p>Using the Linux/RK Utilities commands, a Linux/RT resource
may be attached to legacy program processes. The legacy process
does not have to include any real-time programming constructs. I
tried an experiment with my Netscape browser. I attached a resource
set to the browser (about 5% of CPU), and then started a large file
transfer using FTP and printing a large PDF document. My browser
seemed to do okay.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d8580.0x21d1210"></a>Support and Manuals</h2></div></div><p>Three manuals and a booklet came with the review copy of the
product: the TimeSys Linux/RT User's Manual, the TimeTrace for
TimeSys Linux/RT User's Manual and a TimeSys Linux/RT Programmer's
Manual. The booklet titled &ldquo;The Concise Handbook of Real-Time
Systems&rdquo; is like a Cliff Notes of real-time terms, concepts and
architectures. TimeTrace and Linux/RT User Guides clearly presented
the relationship of the two products. The user guides and booklet
are illustrated, and for the most part they are well-written. All
install directions are high-level and written for the experienced
software installer.</p><p>About half of each Linux/RT and TimeTrace User Guide is spent
discussing real-time software and its attributes. The remaining
half of the guide focuses on using the product. Linux/RT's user
guide and Release Notes describe how to use a graphical Linux/RT
resource manager. Finding the command to start the graphical
resource manager was a challenge. In the review copy, it was not
compiled and nowhere near the Release Notes said the command lived.
I do not think this is the result of installing Linux/RT on a
non-Debian distribution. In another place, the Linux/RT User's
Manual said the module measure-rk had to be loaded to use
TimeTrace. No compiled version of the module measure-rk could be
located in my installation. I did locate some source code that
looked like it might be the module. The TimeTrace manual indicated
one used viewrk file to use TimeTrace. Since there was no module
named measure-rk available, I used the viewrk file. Viewrk seem to
work okay.</p><p>Appendix A contains a list of Linux/RT RK utility commands.
Several of these have the wrong capitalization. Others do not exist
as listed. I was unable to locate several of the commands in
/usr/local/bin directory in the manuals. One example is printing
the clock frequency. The list of utilities says the command
<span   class="bold"><b>clockfreq</b></span> is used. The command did
not exist in my installation. I did find a
<span   class="bold"><b>rkfreq</b></span> command that provided the
clock frequency. There is also a file named charter. I was unable
to locate any information on this executable file. No man pages
were installed by the product. The PDF versions of the User and
Programmer Manuals seem to be just an electronic copy of the
printed manuals. A keyword search of the PDF files did not produce
any information on the abovementioned files.</p><p>The 179-page Programmer's Manual discusses how to create,
execute and debug real-time programs. Example program listings are
provided to illustrate the various functions and system calls.
GNU-Emacs, make, CVS, gcc and gdb may be used to develop and debug
Linux/RT-based real-time programs. Compiling or recompiling any of
the distributed sample code requires linking to librk.a. Of the
three references to this file's location, the Programmer's Manual
was the most accurate. Be prepared to edit makefile directories to
correctly identify the proper location of the library and header
files. Due to missing files, I had some problems compiling the
sample code. I think compiling original work should go just
fine.</p><p>Support is offered via the TimeSys web site. Questions may
also be e-mailed and faxed to TimeSys Support. I did not use
TimeSys fax support, and cannot comment on its quality. Most of the
questions in the web site FAQ struck me as very marketing-oriented.
Searchable knowledge bases or other forms of technical on-line
support were not readily obvious to me. There was the beginning of
a discussion forum. Based on the few postings (at the time of this
review), I am not sure of the usefulness of this forum.</p><p>I had some problems getting TimeTrace to display a graph of
the racer and rolling sample programs, so I sent a support request
e-mail. TimeSys seemed to be going through some growing pains, and
it took several days to get a response. Once e-mail contact was
made, TimeSys support staff worked with me on resolving the
problem.</p><p><a href="4142s1.html" target="_self">Good/Bad</a></p><p>Overall, I think Linux/RT software looks promising and should
be able to do the job. The documentation needs some cleaning up and
to more accurately reflect file placement and command usage. At
some point, I believe Linux/RT will require fixes and patches. The
web site should be able to provide fixes and patches without
requiring one to download the 12+MB Linux/RT tar file. If support
depends upon registering the product, then there needs to be some
simple way for a customer to indicate they bought the
product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20d8580.0x21d1688"></a>Hardware Used in Review</h2></div></div><p>This software was reviewed using the following hardware: a
