    Connect machines to each other and themselves using software
    instead of KM switchboxes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc85b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>What is synergy? The dictionary defines
it as an &ldquo;advantageous conjunction of distinct elements&rdquo;. The
Synergy utility achieves this conjunction by transparently sharing
a single keyboard and mouse between two or more computers using a
TCP/IP network. Synergy also shares selected text and clipboard
selections with full ICCCM (Inter-Client Communication Conventions
Manual) and Unicode support. It automatically translates linefeeds
between UNIX and Windows formats, enabling cut and paste across
systems as easily as within a single system. In addition, it forces
screensavers to activate and deactivate in concert. In short, each
computer uses its own display(s), and you simply roll the mouse off
the edge of one display to jump to another. So, it's almost like
having one big desktop spread across multiple computers.
</p><p>Synergy provides a software replacement for keyboard/mouse
(KM) switchboxes. It currently runs on Linux and Windows and has
preliminary support for Solaris; any combination of these platforms
works. This article describes how to install and configure Synergy
between two (or more) Linux boxes. Configuration usually takes only
a few minutes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc8710"></a>Building and Installing</h2></div></div><p>First, download the latest stable version of Synergy from
SourceForge
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergy2" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/synergy2</a>).
Then follow the usual steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzf synergy-<span   class="emphasis"><em>X.Y.Z</em></span>.tar.gz
cd synergy-
./configure
make
su -c 'make install'
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>X.Y.Z</em></span> is the version number. You
can install a prebuilt RPM instead, which is also available from
the site. Executables are installed in /usr/local/bin unless you
provided a different location to <b  >configure</b>.
Repeat this process on each computer to be connected or simply copy
over the binaries (synergyc and synergys).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc8a28"></a>Configuring the Server</h2></div></div><p>Next, choose the server, the system with the keyboard and
mouse physically connected to it. This system requires a Synergy
configuration file that names the server, the computers that may
connect (the clients) and their virtual screen arrangement. It's a
plain-text file with two required and one optional sections. Here's
an example configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
section: screens
  guava:
  mango:
end
section: links
  guava:
    right = mango
    up    = guava
  mango:
    left  = guava
end
section: aliases
  guava:
    guava.tropical-fruit.org
  mango:
    mango.tropical-fruit.org
end
</pre><p>The screens section simply lists the server hostname and the
hostnames of all permitted clients. The links section describes the
virtual adjacency of the computers. For example, guava lists mango
as being located to its right, so when the mouse moves off the
right edge of guava it appears at the opposite (i.e., left) edge of
mango. Each computer can have at most one of each of the following
directions listed: left, right, up and down. A computer also can
link to itself; in this example, moving off the top of guava will
move the mouse to the bottom of guava.
</p><p>Links are not automatically symmetric. Making the jump to
mango reversible requires that guava is listed as being to the left
of mango. This feature becomes more useful with more than two
computers. For example, a third computer, banana, could be up from
guava and mango, but only one of those could be down from
banana.</p><p>The third section, aliases, is optional. Clients provide
their hostname (or a name specified on the command line) to the
server when connecting, so the server can find them in the
configuration. Some systems report their fully qualified domain
name, others list only their hostname, depending on their network
configuration. The aliases section, as it suggests, provides a list
of names that each computer is known as. The above configuration
permits mango to connect as mango or mango.tropical-fruit.com. The
server also checks the aliases when looking up its own name.</p><p>You may have noticed the configuration file doesn't indicate
whether guava or mango is the server. That's because doing so isn't
necessary. This configuration works as is with either system as the
server. For this example, we'll assume guava is the server. Prepare
a configuration file for your particular setup using the above
example as a template, and save it to $HOME/.synergy.conf.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc8ce8"></a>Testing the Client and Server</h2></div></div><p>Now start the Synergy server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
synergys -f -1
</pre><p>We cover the meaning of the options later on. The server logs
some messages to the shell, and if all goes well, it's ready and
waiting for connections. Any links from the server to itself in the
configuration should work at this point. On guava we could move the
mouse off the top edge of the screen, and it would jump to the
bottom edge.
</p><p>With the server running, you're ready to connect a client
system. On your other system (mango in our example) start the
client with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
synergyc -f -1 --no-camp guava
</pre><p>replacing guava with the hostname or network address of your
server. The client also logs some messages to the shell and either
connects to the server or quits with an error. If it connected
successfully you can now use the mouse, keyboard and clipboard
between the two systems. Test any other clients in the same way.
</p><p>If the command-line options are invalid or the configuration
file has an error, Synergy writes an error message to the shell and
quits. If the server or client fails for some other reason, you'll
receive a log message prefixed by ERROR or FATAL briefly describing
the problem. Space here doesn't permit a complete list of errors,
but the message should provide enough information to diagnose the
problem.</p><p>The command-line options used above indicate that the client
and server should run in the foreground, messages should be logged
to the shell (-f) and the system should quit when a nonpermanent
error occurs (-1). By default, both the client and server run in
the background, messages are logged to syslog and the system waits
a few seconds then retries after non-permanent errors. The
--no-camp option tells the client to quit after the server
forcefully closes a successful connection. Normally the client
cleans up then tries connecting again; more on that below. A few
other options are available; use --help to see a list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad0580.0x1bc9058"></a>Starting Synergy Automatically</h2></div></div><p>Once you've tested the server and client(s), you'll probably
want them to start automatically in the future. Synergy requires an
X server, so starting it before the X server starts won't work. The
easiest way to start Synergy automatically is to add a line to your
$HOME/.xsession or similar X session startup script. Typically,
you'd run the Synergy server from .xsession with no arguments and
run the client with the server hostname as the only argument.
They'd run in the background and quit when the X server quits or
restarts.</p><p>The problem with this setup is Synergy isn't running during
the login screen, which is managed by XDM or one of the eqivalents
such as GDM or KDM. If you have the necessary permissions, you can
reconfigure your display manager to start Synergy when the X server
starts. First, copy $HOME/.synergy.conf to /etc/synergy.conf (no
leading dot on the latter) so the display manager can find it. Then
edit the display manager's Xsetup script; different distributions
put this file in different places so you may have to search for it.
Near the end of the script but before any call to exit add two
lines. You can use either:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/killall synergyc
/usr/local/bin/synergyc guava
</pre><p>replacing guava with the hostname of your server to start the
client, or:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/killall synergys
/usr/local/bin/synergys
</pre>


to start the server. Don't forget to remove any lines in your
.xsession that try to start Synergy. For security reasons, some
display managers (XDM and KDM, but not GDM) grab the keyboard and
do not release it until the user logs in. This prevents a Synergy
server from sharing the mouse and keyboard until the user logs in.
It doesn't prevent a Synergy client from synthesizing mouse and
keyboard input, though; log in to the server and then use Synergy
to log in to the client.
</p><p>Without the --no-camp option, the client tries connecting to
the server every 60 seconds until it succeeds, so the client can
start before the server. You can exploit this feature on a laptop:
run the client on the laptop all the time. When it's attached to
your home network, it'll connect to the Synergy server within 60
seconds. Then you can use the server's keyboard and mouse instead
of the laptop's.</p><p>Finally, an important note about security. As of this
writing, Synergy has no authentication and no encryption
safeguards. Because it transmits all mouse and keyboard input,
including passwords, do not use Synergy on or across untrusted
networks. Future versions of Synergy will address this
shortcoming.</p></div></div>
