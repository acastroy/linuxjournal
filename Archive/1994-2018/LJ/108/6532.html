    Here's how to get started using a scanner from Linux, and a
    comparison of the features in available scanning software.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x294d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>A few years ago, Linux users were often
confronted by the complex relationship between off-the-shelf video
hardware and the XFree86 drivers that made them work. To understand
how to configure your new video card, you needed to understand
detailed hardware issues, such as which chipset your video card
used. While this problem has eased as more video card makers have
started to support XFree86 development directly and to provide
their own XFree86 drivers, the Linux scanner world still is in that
detailed hardware stage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x294d710"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>Scanners can connect to a PC in three basic ways: through a
parallel port, through a SCSI bus host adapter or through the newer
Universal Serial Bus (USB). It's next to impossible to find
off-the-shelf scanners that don't support USB these days, though
many also support parallel interfaces as well. SCSI interfaces
mostly have been dropped by scanner makers in favor of USB.</p><p>USB support in the Linux 2.4 kernel series can be handled
either by using the USB kernel scanner driver or by using the
libusb library. You can check for the kernel scanner driver by
running the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lsmod | grep scanner
</pre><p>If this command returns anything, you have the kernel scanner
driver. If it doesn't, you can load the scanner driver with this
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe scanner
</pre>


This command also will load the USB core module (called usbcore
when you run <b  >lsmod</b>) if it's not already loaded.
In order for the scanner to work with USB, the right USB HCI module
also must be loaded. For USB 1.0 devices, the module to load is
usb-uhci. For USB 1.1 it's usb-ohci. For 2.0 devices, even when
running at lower speeds, it's usb-ehci. My USB hardware is USB 1.1,
so I have to load the OHCI version:
<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe usb-ohci
</pre>


To use the libusb library instead, remove the scanner modules using
this command (which should be run as the root user):
<pre     class="programlisting">
rmmod scanner
</pre>


Although support for the kernel scanner driver is rumored to be
going away with the forthcoming 2.6 kernel release, it's still
common in the current 2.4 kernels. Therefore, for the rest of this
article we assume the use of the kernel scanner driver.
</p><p>You can launch your scanner software using a script that runs
the appropriate modprobe commands, so you can make sure the scanner
driver is already loaded. Alternatively, you can use one of the
system start-up scripts, such as the /etc/rc.local file commonly
used on Red Hat systems, to load the scanner at boot time.</p><p>With the scanner driver loaded, next mount the USB
filesystem, again as the root user:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount /proc/bus/usb
</pre><p>Then you can list the devices on the USB bus:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /proc/bus/usb/devices
</pre>


This command won't produce any output if you don't have the
scanner, USB core and HCI drivers (either uhci, ohci or ehci, as
described previously) loaded. The devices file is verbose, but what
you're looking for are the vendor and product IDs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
P:  Vendor=04b8 ProdID=011d Rev= 1.00
</pre>


Hang on to these values&mdash;you'll need them later if SANE can't find
your scanner. If you want to be certain your scanner will be seen
by SANE, reload the scanner driver like so:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rmmod scanner
modprobe scanner vendor=0x4b8 product=0x011d
</pre>


We included the vendor and product IDs this time when we loaded the
scanner driver. We also prefixed the IDs with 0x&mdash;this is required
if you use the modprobe command in this way.
</p><p>The sane-usb man page gives a more detailed discussion on
getting your USB scanner configured. See the Linux USB Project page
at <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org" target="_self">www.linux-usb.org</a>
for help with general USB configuration and testing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x294dd98"></a>The Tools of the Trade</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have the basic hardware configuration, we want to
make sure the SANE software can access it. The version of SANE used
for this article is 1.0.8. SANE software comes in two parts: the
back-end driver software and the front-end user interfaces. SANE
actually only provides the back-end drivers and a few command-line
front ends. X-based graphical front ends, such as XSane and
QuiteInsane, are separate projects that make use of the SANE back
ends.</p><p>Most modern Linux distributions now include a version of the
SANE back ends. However, many distributions are providing outdated
releases. The SANE web site
(<a href="http://www.mostang.com/sane" target="_self">www.mostang.com/sane</a>)
provides links to current binary distributions in RPM or similar
formats for Red Hat, Debian, Mandrake and Slackware.</p><p>Once you have the SANE back ends installed, you need to
configure the back-end drivers. The first trick is to make sure
SANE can find a scanner. The SANE software provides a command-line
tool, called sane-find-scanner, that can find any SCSI scanner and
most USB scanners. Run this command either with your normal user ID
or as root; no command-line options are necessary. The output from
this command will be some comments and a line that looks something
like this (for USB scanners):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sane-find-scanner: found USB scanner
    (vendor = 0x04b8, product = 0x011d)
    at device /dev/usb/scanner0
</pre><p>This means SANE can see the scanner using the device
/dev/usb/scanner0, which is good; thus, we need to configure only
this scanner's back-end drivers. However, if you don't get a line
like this&mdash;if no scanner can be found&mdash;when you run
<b  >sane-find-scanner</b> as your normal user, you might
have to change the permissions of the device file. You can verify
this by running the command as the root user. If
<b  >sane-find-scanner</b> finds the scanner when run as
root, the problem is a permissions issue. Assuming you are the only
user on your machine, the problem is simple to fix:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chown <span   class="emphasis"><em>owner</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>owner</em></span> /dev/usb/scanner0
chmod 660 /dev/usb/scanner0
</pre>


In this example, <span   class="emphasis"><em>owner</em></span> is your user ID and
group ID. If you need to share this scanner with other users, you
can set up a scanner group instead:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chgrp scanner /dev/usb/scanner0
chmod 660 /dev/usb/scanner0
</pre>


These two commands need to be run as root. All users who need
access to the scanner must be added to the scanner group. One other
note on the device file: you may be tempted to make a symbolic link
from /dev/usb/scanner0 to /dev/scanner. Don't. The SCSI back ends
use the /dev/scanner device name, and linking it to the USB device
will confuse the USB back ends.
</p><p>Now that SANE can see the scanner, it's time to choose its
back-end driver. This is the first tricky part. For most Epson
scanners you would use the Epson back end. But for the Epson
Perfection 1260&mdash;an affordable model commonly stocked by most
electronics stores&mdash;the back end is actually the Plustek driver.
For most scanners you can make educated guesses from the SANE web
site supported-hardware list. Barring that, you can try to find the
vendor and product IDs and match them to the information on the
supported-hardware list on the Linux USB Project web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x294e318"></a>SANE Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have picked the appropriate driver, it's time to
configure the back end. If you installed SANE using RPMs or using
the default configuration when built from source, SANE's
configuration files are located under /etc/sane.d. The main
configuration file is called dll.conf. This file tells SANE which
drivers to use. By default, many drivers are enabled. If you have
only the one, you can limit this to the driver for your specific
scanner. In our example, we've uncommented only the Epson driver,
because we're using the Epson KOWA back end instead of the Plustek
driver.</p><p>Not all back ends support all types of scanners. No matter
what type of connection your scanner uses, each back-end
configuration file needs to know the name of the device file your
scanner will use. Remember, we found the device filename using the
sane-find-scanner tool. Unfortunately, the format used to define
this in the configuration file varies from back end to back
end.</p><p>The Plustek back end (the default back end for SANE support
of the Epson Perfection 1260) includes distinct sections for the
USB and parallel port types of scanners. To specify the device file
in this configuration file, use the device keyword followed by the
name of the device file, as in this example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
device /dev/usb/scanner0
</pre><p>This entry must go in the appropriate section of the Plustek
driver configuration file. However, in the Epson configuration file
used by the Epson KOWA back-end driver for the Epson Perfection
1260, the device file is specified using the USB keyword followed
by the device filename, as in this example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
usb /dev/usb/scanner0
</pre>


Both the Epson and Plustek configuration files provide comments to
help in their configuration, and all back ends have their own man
pages to provide further configuration assistance. Though many
configuration options are provided, the only option really required
for all of them is the device file.
</p><p>To test that your SANE configuration is working, try the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scanimage -T
</pre><p>If your test fails, you may want to verify once again that
the proper USB modules have been installed, that the device can be
found by sane-find-scanner and that you have the correct device
filename in your SANE back-end configuration file. The scanimage
program's help option also can provide quite a bit of additional
information about your scanner's capabilities:
<pre     class="programlisting">
scanimage --help
</pre>

now is an easy-to-use, front-end graphical interface that lets you
preview your scans, select regions to scan from the preview and,
perhaps, make color, quality and resolution adjustments. You also
need a way to get the scan into The GIMP for further
processing.</p><p>There are actually three freely available front ends for use
with SANE, plus a shareware tool that exists outside of SANE. Let's
take a brief look at each before comparing features and quality
issues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x294e898"></a>XSane</h2></div></div><p>This project has grown up with the SANE Project, side by
side. The user interface is based on GTK+, and it includes a GIMP
plugin to allow scanning directly from the File&reg;Acquire menu in
The GIMP.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6532f1.large.jpg"><img src="6532f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The XSane Front End Managing the Epson Perfection 1260
</p></div></div><p>When run as a GIMP plugin, the Viewer window is not used&mdash;the
scanned image is transferred directly to The GIMP in a Canvas
window. Be sure to read the documentation thoroughly to get the
most from this interface, including the links to the scanning tips
web pages.</p><p>The Preview window allows both user-defined and automatic
scan regions to be set. Black, gray and white points also can be
set in the preview prior to the full-sized scan. The Viewer window
provides limited editing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x294ec08"></a>QuiteInsane</h2></div></div><p>Like XSane, QuiteInsane offers a GIMP plugin. However, this
plugin is in early development and may not provide as much
stability as XSane's. Beyond this, QuiteInsane offers much of the
same functionality as XSane, plus a few extras. QuiteInsane's image
viewer allows the user to select regions of the image to work with
and permits printing directly from the image viewer.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6532f2.large.jpg"><img src="6532f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. The QuiteInsane Front End Managing the
Epson Perfection 1260</p></div></div>
</p><p>QuiteInsane integrates into the KDE desktop, allowing
drag-and-drop of images from the Image Viewer into other
applications. Although integrating with other applications may not
be required, it's a nice feature to have for desktop users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x2d471c8"></a>Image Scan!</h2></div></div><p>The only scanner maker to support the SANE Project actively
is Epson. The Epson KOWA Corporation has released their own front
end, known as Image Scan!, along with an updated back end that
unifies support for all current Epson scanners. This product has
the advantage of providing updated drivers for off-the-shelf
scanners directly from the manufacturer.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6532f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Image Scan! Front End Managing the Epson Perfection
1260
</p></div></div><p>This front end is less sophisticated than XSane or
QuiteInsane, providing fewer features, yet it has a cleaner, less
cluttered interface. It also lacks a built-in image viewer, opting
to use either The GIMP specifically for image editing or saving
scans directly to a file or a printer. There is no built-in help
and little on-line documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x2d474e0"></a>VueScan</h2></div></div><p>XSane, QuiteInsane and Image Scan! all function as front-end
user interfaces to the SANE back-end scanner drivers. However, one
other scanner product does not use the SANE back ends at all:
VueScan from Hamrick Software. This product is shareware and
provides its own set of scanner drivers for a wide variety of
scanners.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6532f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The VueScan Front End Managing the Epson Perfection 1260
</p></div></div><p>VueScan offers many features not provided by the front ends
to SANE, such as device calibration, focus and exposure. It does
not provide image editing or a GIMP plugin. Scans need to be saved
to file first, then opened in an image editor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x2d477f8"></a>Feature Comparisons</h2></div></div><p>Of the four front ends, only one is limited to one
vendor&mdash;Image Scan!, which supports only Epson scanners. The other
three support various vendors. All front ends provide variations on
gamma and color channel correction either before or after a scan,
or both in some cases. XSane, QuiteInsane and VueScan all provide a
built-in image viewer with limited image editing capabilities.
Image Scan! scans only to a file or directly into The GIMP.</p><p>The areas of largest differentiation in all four front ends
are where scans can be sent and how they can be printed. XSane
offered the most destinations for scans, including e-mail and FAX.
Optical character recognition (OCR) is supported by both XSane and
QuiteInsane through the external gocr program.</p><p>XSane, QuiteInsane and Image Scan! provide a continuous
update to the preview display when a preview scan is in progress.
This means you can watch the scan as it happens. The same is true
for full scans. VueScan does not provide continuous updates.</p><p>Printing is by far the biggest difference in all four.
QuiteInsane is the only front end that offers printing from the
application, with various print options. XSane can scan directly to
the printer, but you can't print a scan from the built-in image
viewer. VueScan offers printing from the image viewer, but the
interface is clunky and lacks features.</p><p>Documentation for both XSane and QuiteInsane is extensive and
fairly well written. HTML documentation is also provided for
VueScan but is far less complete. Image Scan! has a minimalist man
page.</p><p>All of the open-source tools provide GIMP plugins, though
VueScan does not. XSane's plugin is the most advanced in stability.
QuiteInsane's plugin is feature-rich but is under early development
and may not be as stable as users might prefer. Image Scan!'s
plugin is functionally equivalent to its standalone version, while
XSane and QuiteInsane offer slightly modified versions for their
GIMP plugins.</p><p>Table 1 is a comparison of the four scanner front ends.
Although this table is a good tool for choosing which front end to
start with, you would be missing out if you didn't at least try
each of them.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6532t1.large.jpg"><img src="6532t1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Table 1. Scanner Front-End

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x2d47d20"></a>Quality Comparisons</h2></div></div><p>All scans for XSane and QuiteInsane will be essentially the
same because of the use of the common SANE back ends. Image Scan!
includes a driver that provides the same level of quality as the
Epson Windows driver. VueScan's driver is its own. In Figure 5, the
two scans compare the Epson and the VueScan driver. Figure 6 shows
a close-up of these scans around the eyes. The SANE version has a
smoother transition between pixels, and the VueScan provides more
detail in the reflection in the left eye.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6532f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2855580.0x2d48198"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Each front end has its own unique benefits and drawbacks.
XSane's support for scan quality is based on film media options,
such as Agfa, Fuji and Kodak film negatives, which give it added
ease of use.</p><p>Image Scan! is targeted more toward the casual desktop user.
As an added bonus it provides a driver straight from Epson that
supports commonly available scanners.</p><p>VueScan is much faster than the other tools for zooming in on
the preview, because it keeps the scan in memory. This makes
VueScan preferable to the SANE-based solutions for those who scan
large numbers of images.</p><p>Only VueScan offers multiple color space support, including
sRGB, PAL, NTSC, CIE, Apple, Adobe and others. It was, however, the
only one to crash during testing.</p><p>QuiteInsane has numerous features that are missing from the
other front ends. For example, menubars can be moved, which is a
feature this front end inherited from the use of Qt. Other benefits
of this tool include a user-modifiable curve graph, similar to The
GIMP's Curves tool for adjusting red, green and blue channels;
printing directly from the Viewer window with user-configurable
scaling; margins; image resolution; and page size options.</p><p>However, there are no color-correction presets based on media
types, and the available preset scan sizes are in millimeters and
non-US standard sizes&mdash;no letter or legal options. Despite these
few missing features, QuiteInsane has the edge.</p><p>Whether you are a professional artist or a casual
photographer, there are plenty of Linux-based scanning options.
Each front-end user interface offers something different, and
back-end drivers are plentiful, with manufacturers such as Epson
starting to offer their own versions supporting their specific
models. These all combine to put scanning on Linux on par with any
desktop.</p><p><a href="6532s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
