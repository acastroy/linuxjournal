On November 11, 2002, the William and Melinda Gates Foundation
announced a commitment of $100 million towards HIV/AIDS prevention
in India. The announcement came on the eve of a highly publicized
visit to India by William Gates himself. Timed for release with his
arrival there, Microsoft announced it would be &ldquo;deepening its
India commitment by making investments of approximately $400
million US over the next three years in several aspects of its
India business including education, partnerships, innovation,
localization and the Development Center.&rdquo; So, did it work? The
better question might be: how could it work?</p><p>Here in the US, spending on information technology (IT) is
notoriously down. Although there's a great deal of whining about
this by CEOs and IT technology suppliers, the conditions hardly
compare with those in India, where the $600 US price of a cheap PC
might amount to a year's salary.</p><p>No doubt the cheap, black-market pricing of Windows' earlier
generations did much to allow Microsoft to spread as far as it has
in India. But the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> reports the
distance isn't all that great, because there still are only about
four million PCs in a country with a population exceeding a billion
(and expected to pass China by the middle of the century).</p><p>But unlike earlier versions of the OS, Windows XP is built
not to work unless the user calls or logs in to have the software
turned on by Microsoft's authentication process. If Microsoft has
its way, all copies in India will be paid for.</p><p>Windows XP isn't cheap. And even though it's competing with a
free OS, Gates said Microsoft had no plans to discount the OS
beyond the usual breaks for educational organizations. Given the
competitive situation, how can Microsoft win against Linux in an
economy where MS goods carry luxury pricing?</p><p>I don't know, and I don't much care&mdash;that's Microsoft's
problem. What's interesting to me is the other stuff that borrowed
interest in Microsoft's problem brings up, such as the potentially
leading role that Indian developers are likely to play in the Linux
movement.</p><p>There are some very ambitious Linux developers in India. Take
Rajesh Jain, for example. After I wrote about India on the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> web site, a reader wrote to clue
me in about what Jain is up to with his new company,
Emergic:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Like Michael Robertson, he was in the internet
news business with IndiaWorld, which he subsequently sold. I think
that along with Lindows he is one of the folks trying out something
in a different fashion with Linux, and there is definitely a huge
market at the lower end if he makes the right (whatever those might
be) moves.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here's how Jain describes his plans:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Emergic is about creating a software platform
that brings down costs of technology by a factor of 10, thus making
it affordable for consumers and enterprises in the world's emerging
markets.
</p><p>Emergic is about realizing Bill Gates' vision of &ldquo;a computer
on every desktop and in every home&rdquo;--a vision that has not yet
gone beyond the world's 10,000 largest companies and 500 million
consumers, most of whom are in the world's developed
markets.</p><p>Emergic is going to become the computing platform for the
next 500 million consumers and the world's 25 million small and
medium [-sized] enterprises, who have not been able to adopt
technology because of its dollar-denominated pricing.</p><p>Emergic is targeted at the world's emerging markets, because
they are where technology has not yet penetrated deeply, and yet,
for whom, technology offers perhaps the last opportunity to better
integrate into the world's value chain and improve the standard of
living for their people.</p></blockquote></div><p>Jain wants to drive the cost of hardware down to $125-150 US
or less and software down to $5-10 US/month. And he wants to do it
by leveraging old computers as thin clients for running
applications, all the usual Linux suspects. He explains:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What is different about thin clients this time
around? After all, they've been talked about ever since computing
began.
</p><p>The major difference is the re-use of older hardware. We use
older cars, older manufacturing plants, older homes, but we don't
tend to use older computers.</p><p>The world's developed markets have been saturated with
technology. New PC sales now imply upgrades, creating a huge supply
of older computers. (These PCs) still have a lot of life left in
them&mdash;after all, they are no more than a few years old [and they]
can be available for $100 US or so in large numbers or $125-150 US
in smaller quantities.</p></blockquote></div><p>He's counting on broadband and talking mostly about
enterprise environments:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Server-based computing using Linux is now
possible because LAN speeds have gone up to 100Mbps, enabling the
transfer of a lot more data over the same network. The result is
that a &ldquo;thick server&rdquo; (which is actually a new desktop with 1GB
RAM and two hard disks in a software RAID configuration) can easily
support 30-40 users. Such a server would cost about $1,500-2,000
US, implying a per-client cost of no more than $50 US.
</p><p>Taken together, the thin client and thick server combination
not only brings down the cost of both hardware and software by 90%,
but it also provides the IT manager complete control of the client
desktop from the server. What every user sees on their thin client
can be standardized and controlled from the thick server
itself.</p></blockquote></div><p>There's a lot more to his plans, but rather than focus on
them, let's look at some other things that are happening in the
culture itself. For example, consider the work being done at the
Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. Writes Peter Day in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>BBC News</em></span>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The Indian Institute of Management is not merely
for potential internet billionaires, and the students in their new
blue gowns are not the reason for my journey.
</p><p>I go to Ahmedabad to have lunch with a tableful of some of
the most ingenious people I have ever met&mdash;inventors and gadgeteers
from the fields and villages of rural India where 700 million of
its one billion people still live. Over rice and dhal and
vegetables eaten with the hand, they talk excitedly about their
inventions and ideas.</p></blockquote></div><p>They are gathered under the auspices of the Society for
Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies and
Innovation. The acronym spells Sristi, the Sanskrit word for
creation.</p><p>Sristi is the creation of Anil Gupta, a professor from the
Institute whose Honeybee Network has been collecting creative ideas
from around rural India for the past ten years. The idea database
now exceeds 10,000.</p><p>Then there are Dr Sugara Mitra's hole-in-the-wall experiments
(see &ldquo;Natural Forces&rdquo; from the March 2002 issue), by which street
urchins in New Delhi and elsewhere around the country learn
computing from free public kiosks.</p><p>My points: 1) We're talking about highly resourceful people
here&mdash;a lot of them. 2) We're also talking about values very much
in line with what Linux, free software and open source are all
about. That's why I wouldn't be surprised to see Tux beat Bux in a
big way here, first.</p></div></div>
