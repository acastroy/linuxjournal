    Product review of new Kylix release.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d2500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Kylix is a powerful RAD (rapid
application development) tool. All three flavors of Kylix 3.0
(Open, Professional and Enterprise) come with both C++ and Delphi
(Pascal) compilers. The Enterprise edition I reviewed comes with
more than 190 components for rapid application development. On top
of generic GUI-building components, it also comes with Borland's
dbExpress architecture, which enables native access to DB2,
Oracle9i, Informix, Informix SE, InterBase, MySQL and PostgreSQL
databases. It also comes with BizSnap, WebSnap and DataSnap
components, which enable easy development of web services that
interoperate with enterprise databases.
</p><p>The Kylix 3.0 Enterprise package contains a lot of
documentation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Quick Start Guide</em></span>: an
introduction to the product. You will learn how to customize the
IDE, and it will also give you an idea of the terminology used to
describe various parts of the user interface and its
functions.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Kylix Developers Guide</em></span>: a
decent-sized book with in-depth information on usage and
development with Kylix. It contains numerous code examples in both
C++ and Delphi syntax. It also gives a rather detailed description
of the CLX component library. Most of the CLX components are
portable between Windows and Linux. For the components that are not
portable, this guide has a whole chapter dedicated to porting
applications from Windows to Linux.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Delphi Language Guide</em></span>: the
name of this guide says it all. It comes in handy if you've never
used Object Pascal but are interested in learning. It also can be a
good reference if you are a Delphi programmer.</p></li><li><p>CLX (pronounced &ldquo;clicks&rdquo;) Object Hierarchy
poster: this poster shows in an easy-to-read tree view how all the
CLX components (objects) fit together. It uses color coding to
represent the editions of Kylix in which the objects are available.
The Enterprise edition has the most components, and the Open
edition has the least.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Borland Solution Partner Resource
Guide</em></span>: creating components for Kylix is a business in
itself. Many different companies write various components for
Kylix. For a few hundred dollars, most of the solution partners
will provide you with objects that can drastically cut down on your
development time. A full list of solution partners is available at
<a href="http://www.BorlandSolutions.com" target="_self">www.BorlandSolutions.com</a>.</p></li><li><p>Kylix Enterprise (CD): contains the Kylix
development executables, libraries and other resources, including
source code for all the components. The full component source is
useful, but because all the components were written in Delphi, they
might be a bit hard to understand if you are not a Pascal buff. The
CD also contains both C++ and Delphi versions of the compiler and a
lot of sample code. After installing the software, take a look at
the examples in the kylix3/examples/ directory and the tutorials in
the kylix3/documentation directory.</p></li><li><p>Companion Tools (CD): I definitely recommend
browsing through this CD as it includes a lot of nice tools. This
software doesn't belong to Borland; the tools were written by
individuals, groups or corporations. Here you will find various
components such as compression, profiling, scripting and game
components. Each and every tool comes with its own license, and
it's nice to find a lot of open-source code under the GPL and
LGPL.</p></li><li><p>Enterprise Server (CD): here you will find
Borland's application server. The server comes with a development
license; a deployment license key needs to be obtained
separately.</p></li><li><p>Rave Reports (CD): this visual designer by Nevrona
Design lets you create custom reports. Once you start the designer,
you can point and click to design the look of your report. You can
generate reports through different data sources, including database
lookups. Once you have your design ready, you save the design into
a file, which is later used by calling on the Rave components to
generate a report.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d2ea0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>On the installation CD are several text files that you should
probably read before installing. They contain descriptions of
caveats associated with the installation, development, building and
deployment process. After reading the text files on the CD, I ran
the installation script. The software can be installed in text mode
or graphical mode under X. The script will check to see if it can
make a connection to the X server. If it can, the installation
process will run under X. This portion of the installation actually
uses the Loki installer, and everything is pretty straightforward.
One problem was that it didn't create the KDE icons, despite the
fact that I checked the box for the installer to do so.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d2fa8"></a>First Run</h2></div></div><p>When you run the command <b  >startbcb</b> to bring
up the C++ version of the IDE, a registration window will pop up.
After filling in the data, the on-line registration went without a
problem. After the registration window is closed, a nice splash
window pops up. It takes quite a bit of time to load the IDE, so I
can see the need for a splash screen. When the development
environment is fully loaded, a default project is generated.</p><p>The IDE is comprised of several floating windows. The main
window is docked to the top of the desktop, and it contains all the
menus and tabs with the components that are available for use. The
second window is the Object Inspector, which shows all the
properties and events of an object. A property of a visible
component is, for example, what color it should be, its placement
rules, caption and more. Under the Events tab of the Object
Inspector, you can see all the events this component supports, such
as On Click, On Start Drag, On Drag Over and more. The third window
is the code editor that shows files that are a part of your
program. There is a tab for each open file plus a tab called
Diagram. You can drag and drop components onto the Diagram tab from
the Object Tree View to create diagrams of your project. The fourth
window is the Object Tree View, which shows the tree hierarchy of
your program as you add components to it. For a visual
representation, take a look at Figure 1.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d3370"></a>First Compilation</h2></div></div><p>I decided to press the Run button with the default project.
It turns out that my default installation of Linux didn't install
the glibc-devel package. As you can imagine, this generated a lot
of compile errors. It's not a big deal, but I would expect the
installer to warn me about missing package dependencies. I
installed the RPM and pressed the Run button one more time. This
time, the compiler finished, but the linker had problems finding
libX11.so. I knew exactly what was wrong; reading all the Readme
files before the installation paid off. SuSE installer didn't
create the symbolic link libX11.so to libX11.so.6. After I created
the link manually, everything worked. I was ready to write, or
should I say &ldquo;point and click&rdquo;, some code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d3478"></a>Building Projects</h2></div></div><p>The whole IDE interface might be a bit confusing at first.
After you get a feel for it, you will find it's really easy to
build applications. Application design works exactly like a WYSIWG
editor. I grab a few components from the component bar and drop
them onto my form. I assign one or two of the components
properties. What I am looking at is an application that I have not
even compiled yet, but the database lookups are running. Simply
setting the Active properties to true on the database components
was enough to get queries going. I can see how my application would
look if I had actually compiled and ran it. Take a look at Figure 2
to see what I mean.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6374f2.large.jpg"><img src="6374f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Previewing an Application with Real Data
before Compiling</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d3790"></a>Coding</h2></div></div><p>After clicking around I decided that I wanted to see how the
actual coding experience is with the tool. I grabbed a button from
the component bar and placed it onto my form (application main
window). When I double-clicked this button, the Object Inspector
switched to the Events tab and selected the OnClick event.
Meanwhile in the code editor, a code framework for the click event
was built. My keyboard focus was placed at the function block
start, ready for code entry. I wanted the application to close when
I clicked the button that I just placed on the form. I started
typing &ldquo;Application-&gt;&rdquo; and a small window popped up in the
editor. It listed all the functions and properties of my
application instance called &ldquo;Application&rdquo; (Figure 3).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6374f3.large.jpg"><img src="6374f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Automatic Function Name Completion in the
Editor</p></div></div>
</p><p>As I typed in the letter T of the function name (Terminate)
that I wanted to call, the code-completion feature eliminated
properties and functions that didn't match up. When I saw what I
was looking for, I scrolled up and down through the list and
pressed Enter. That filled in the code in the editor, then I need
to add the semicolon at the end. I thought to myself &ldquo;that's nice
but how about if I spice it up a bit?&rdquo; I included a Linux header
file called utsname.h and instantiated a structure of type utsname
and name tst. I typed in <b  >tst.</b> and waited to see
what would happen. The same window popped up and listed all the
structure members and their types (e.g., char[65]). This comes in
handy in those &ldquo;what's that function called again?&rdquo;
moments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12da580.0x13d3b58"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Borland introduced Delphi for Windows a long time ago, with
many of the Kylix features. Years later they introduced the C++
Builder for Windows, which as the name suggests, was the C++
version of Delphi. It is nice that a C++ edition of Kylix for Linux
is finally here. All in all, I like the design of Kylix. Despite
the fact that it's not a new concept, it still has benefits.</p><p>After playing around with Kylix some more I found a few bugs
in the software. When trying to assign images to components, the
application would freeze. I am guessing it's possibly some sort of
synchronization issue because attaching to the Kylix process with
strace brought it back to life. I also found that the
code-completion window sometimes refused to pop up. To put things
in perspective I must say that Kylix was not certified to run on
the distribution that I had freshly installed on my laptop. I used
SuSE 8.1, although Kylix 3.0 was certified to run on SuSE
7.3.</p><p>As a final thought, if you are looking into evaluating
development tools for enterprise applications I would recommend
putting Kylix 3.0 on your &ldquo;tools to evaluate&rdquo; list.</p><p><a href="6374s1.html" target="_self">Product Information</a></p><p><a href="6374s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
