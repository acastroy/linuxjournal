    With GNUstep, you can develop a new application or port one
    from Mac OS X.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26dd450"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article provides an introduction to
GNUstep development. It guides the reader through installing
GNUstep and developing a small application. The Objective-C
language, a true object-oriented superset of ANSI C, is used in
this article. Its syntax is simple, unambiguous and easy to learn.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26dd558"></a>A Short History</h2></div></div><p>OpenStep, which was proposed as an open standard by NeXT
Computer, Inc., in 1994, is a collection of advanced
object-oriented APIs designed for rapidly developing applications
in the Objective-C language. It was designed to be implemented
independently of the computer's operating system. To this end,
there were implementations of the standard for Mach, Microsoft
Windows (NT and 95), Sun Solaris and HP-UX.</p><p>In the early 1990s, GNUstep, a free implementation of the
OpenStep standard, was born. GNUstep aims to be a fully compliant
OpenStep implementation, supporting a wide range of operating
systems, while being entirely free. GNUstep is released under the
terms of the LGPL license. GNUstep currently works well on Linux,
Solaris and most BSDs, and there is also preliminary support for
Microsoft Windows.</p><p>As was widely reported at that time, Apple bought NeXT in
1996. Now, with Mac OS X, Apple is moving forward with Cocoa, an
extension of the OpenStep API. While creating Cocoa, Apple added
new classes that enrich the API. GNUstep is partially supporting
those new features, and better support is being added every
day.</p><p>GNUstep also offers a well-defined separation between the
user-interface classes (part of the application kit) and the
underlying windowing system. This layer, called gnustep-back,
provides implementations for various windowing systems, allowing
gnustep-gui to work properly under various back ends. Back ends
currently are being developed for the X Window System, Microsoft
Windows and Ghostscript. Figure 1 shows the different layers of
GNUstep.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Different Layers of GNUstep
</p></div></div><p>GNUstep also offers bindings to other languages, like Java
(using JIGS) and Ruby (using RIGS), allowing developers to create
applications using those languages. Additionally, GNUstep offers
powerful scripting capabilities through StepTalk, which allows you
to create scriptable applications or servers using Smalltalk.
Finally, GNUstep offers an extension so that Guile, a version of
Scheme, can be used as a scripting language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26dd978"></a>Installing GNUstep</h2></div></div><p>In order to compile GNUstep under Linux, that the following
programs and libraries (with headers) need to be installed
(versions indicated or higher): GNU make 3.75, GNU libc 2.1.2, GNU
gcc 3.0.3, XFree86 4.1, ffcall 1.8, OpenSSL 0.9.6c (not required
but recommended), libtiff 3.5.5 and libxml 2.2.3.</p><p>Once all those requirements are satisfied, you are now ready
to download and compile GNUstep. We are going to install an
unstable release of GNUstep because new features have been added
recently that are worth using and mentioning, especially regarding
Gorm&mdash;the Graphical Object Relationship Modeler. Gorm is a clone of
OpenStep's excellent interface-builder application. Gorm allows the
developer to create user interfaces quickly from a palette of
standard objects.</p><p>Get the following releases from the GNUstep web site: GNUstep
make 1.5.1, GNUstep base 1.5.1, GNUstep gui 0.8.3, GNUstep back
0.8.3 and Gorm 0.2.0.</p><p>Once you have downloaded those releases, you are ready to
install GNUstep. You must first install GNUstep make, base, gui and
finally, back. Look at the INSTALL file of each release carefully
for installation instructions. For detailed instructions on
installing GNUstep, refer to the GNUstep Build Guide for Unix
Systems (see Resources).</p><p>Once GNUstep is compiled and installed, load the proper set
of environment variables by executing a shell script (adjust the
path, if necessary).</p><p>Bash users would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# . /usr/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
</pre><p>And, C-shell users would type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# . /usr/GNUstep/System/Makefiles/GNUstep.csh
</pre>


To compile and install Gorm, simply uncompress the file and type
(as root):
<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd Gorm
# make
# make install
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26ddd98"></a>Developing a Small Application</h2></div></div><p>Now that GNUstep and Gorm are compiled and installed, you can
develop your small application, a simple TIFF image viewer. This
application will use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design. The
MVC design pattern separates a software component into three
pieces: a model, a view and a controller. Figure 2 shows how the
MVC pattern is used in our small application.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6418f2.large.jpg"><img src="6418f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Using the MVC Pattern</p></div></div>
</p><p>Under GNUstep, use Gorm to create the views of an
application. This application allows you to create the user
interface of your application. Once created, the user interface
will be saved as an archive file (containing a serialized object
graph) in its own subdirectory. To start Gorm, simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# openapp Gorm.app
</pre><p>Once Gorm has started, show the Inspector and the Palettes
windows by clicking on the Inspector... and Palettes... menu items
from the Tools menu. Now, create a new application by clicking on
the New Application menu item from the Document menu. Once those
steps are completed, your desktop should look like Figure 3.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Creating a New Application
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Let's examine Figure 3 in order to explain the different
elements. Table 1 shows the different elements, and their
roles.</p><p><a href="6418t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Parts of the Gorm
Interface</a></p><p>From the Palettes window, drag an NSImageView object to the
empty window (My Window) and drop it. Figure 4 shows the icon that
represents the NSImageView object.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. NSImageView Object
</p></div></div><p>Now, click on the NSImageView in the window, and the
inspector window will update itself so you can set the correct
attributes to this object. Set the border to Line Border and the
scaling to To Fit. The Inspector window for the attributes of the
NSImageView should look like Figure 5.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Inspector Window for the Attributes of NSImageView
</p></div></div><p>Now, from the Inspector window, select the Size item from the
combo box at the top to set the auto-sizing properties of the
NSImageView object. Setting the auto-sizing properties to
NSImageView will allow the object to resize properly if the user
resizes the window. Set the parameters by clicking on the lines
inside the Auto-sizing box to look like those in Figure 6.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Setting the Auto-Sizing Parameters
</p></div></div><p>Next set the window attributes. Click on My Window in the
File window. Set the title to Tiff Viewer in the Inspector window.
The Inspector window for the attributes should look like Figure
7.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Setting the Window Attributes
</p></div></div><p>You need to add a menu item so you can open an image file. To
create a new menu item, choose the menu palette from the Palettes
window, drag the Item menu to the Main Menu (above the Hide menu
item) and drop it. Click on the newly created Item menu option in
the Main Menu, set its title from the Inspector window to Load
Image and press Return.</p><p>Now, you need to create a controller class that will interact
with the user interface. Click on the Classes icon from the File
window and select the NSObject item from the tree view. Click on
the Classes menu item in the Gorm menu, and select Create
Subclass.... In the Classes tree view in the File window, you will
now find a NewClass entry. Double-click on the NewClass item and
replace the text with &ldquo;AppController&rdquo;.</p><p>Next, you need to create an outlet for your NSImageView
object. An outlet is an instance variable that refers to an
object&mdash;in this particular case, the NSImageView object. To add an
outlet to your AppController class, click on the Outlet icon to the
right of the AppController class (in the File window); click on the
Classes menu item in the Gorm menu, and select Add
Outlet/Action.... In the Classes tree view in the File window, you
will now find a newOutlet entry as a child item of AppController.
Double-click on the newOutlet item, and replace the text with
&ldquo;imageView&rdquo;. Repeat these steps to add a window outlet.</p><p>After creating the outlet, you need to add an action to your
controller. An action is a target-action method. To add one to the
controller, click on the Action icon to the right of the
AppController class (in the File window); click on the Classes menu
item in the Gorm menu, and select Add Outlet/Action.... In the
Classes tree view in the File window, you will now find a
newAction: entry as a child item of AppController. Double-click on
the newAction: item, and replace the text with
&ldquo;loadImage:&rdquo;.</p><p>You are now ready to instantiate your AppController class in
order to produce a particular object from its class template. You
need to instantiate your controller class because Gorm connects
live objects. Select the AppController item in the File window's
tree view, and click on the Instantiate menu item from the Classes
menu.</p><p>Now you can now connect your live objects (in this case,
NSImageView) to your outlets and set the action. To connect the
NSImageView object to your AppController instance, click the
Objects icon in the File window, then, while pressing the Ctrl key,
click and drag from the AppController icon (from the File window)
to the NSImageView object in the Tiff Viewer window. Click on the
imageView item in the Inspector window, and click on the button
Connect. This connects the NSImageView live object to the imageView
outlet. To connect the window outlet, while pressing the Ctrl key,
click and drag the AppController icon (from the File window) to the
My Window icon (from the File window). Now, click on the window
item from the Inspector window, and finally, click on the Connect
button. Figure 8 illustrates the connection being made between the
window object and its outlet.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Connection Being Made between the Window Object and
Its Outlet
</p></div></div><p>To set the action of the Load Image menu item, Control-click
and drag on the menu item to the AppController instance icon in the
File window. Then, click on target in the Inspector window, select
the loadImage: item, and click on the Connect button. This sets the
action of the Load Image menu item to loadImage:. So, when the Load
Image menu item receives a click from the user, the loadImage:
method will be invoked.</p><p>Now, save everything by choosing the Save menu item from the
Document menu. Give it the name MainMenu. This creates a
MainMenu.gorm directory, holding the archived view of the
application.</p><p>Finally, create the AppController class' source files by
selecting the AppController class entry in the Classes tree view
and choose the Create Class's Files... from the Classes menu. Leave
the names as they are and simply click on the OK button. This
creates two files: AppController.m and AppController.h.</p><p>Now, quit Gorm, open your favorite editor and modify
AppController.h so it looks like Listing 1. The complete source
code with comments is available; see Resources.</p><p><a href="6418l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
AppController.h</a></p><p>Then, modify AppController.m (the implementation of the
AppController class) so that it looks like Listing 2.</p><p><a href="6418l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
AppController.m</a></p><p>Now, create a very basic Model for the
application&mdash;ImageModel. This small class will hold the current
displayed image. Now create the implementation of the ImageModel
class as shown in Listings 3 and 4.</p><p><a href="6418l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
ImageModel.h</a></p><p><a href="6418l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
ImageModel.m</a></p><p>Now, create a small property list, shown in Listing 5, in
which you specify the application name, description and the name of
the main Gorm file to load upon startup.</p><p><a href="6418l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.
TiffViewerInfo.plist</a></p><p>Then, create a small GNUmakefile in order to compile and link
your small application. The GNUmakefile should look like Listing
6.</p><p><a href="6418l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.
GNUmakefile</a></p><p>Finally, compile and start the small application:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# make
# openapp TiffViewer.app
</pre><p>Once the application starts, click on the Load Image menu
item and select a TIFF file. It should display properly in the
window, as shown in Figure 9.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26d62b0"></a>Porting to and from Apple Mac OS X</h2></div></div><p>When porting an application from GNUstep to Mac OS X (or the
other way around), some important things must be considered. For
example, when porting to Mac OS X, you have to redo the user
interface using Interface Builder under Mac OS X. The following
steps are needed to port the application to Mac OS X:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>From the File menu of Project Builder, select New
Project... and select Cocoa Application. Click on the Next
button.</p></li><li><p>Specify the project name (Tiff Viewer) and the
project location. Click on the Finish button.</p></li><li><p>Now, select the Classes node and add the files
AppController.m and ImageModel.m from the Project menu.</p></li><li><p>Expand the Other Sources node and delete the main.m
file.</p></li><li><p>Expand the Resources node and double-click on the
MainMenu.nib node. This will start Interface Builder.</p></li><li><p>Much like you did under Gorm, drag and drop the
NSImageView in the empty window and the Load Image menu item in the
File menu.</p></li><li><p>Because the controller class (AppController) was
created in the previous section, you simply can reuse it under Mac
OS X. In Interface Builder, from the Classes menu, choose Read
Files.. and select AppController.h.</p></li><li><p>From the File window, click on the Classes tab,
select AppController and from the Classes menu, choose Instantiate
AppController.</p></li><li><p>Now, connect the outlets and the action like we did
under Gorm.</p></li><li><p>Save the modified interface, and quit Interface
Builder.</p></li><li><p>From the Build menu in Project Builder, choose
Build and run. This will compile and launch the application.</p></li></ol></div><p>Once the application is launched, choose Load Image from the
file menu and select a picture to show. The final result should
look like Figure 10.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6418f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The Same Application Running under Mac OS X
</p></div></div>

</p><p>As you can see, we have ported the application without
rewriting a single line of code. Even if the application is quite
simple, complex applications can be developed under GNUstep and
easily ported to Mac OS X. Affiche and GNUMail.app are good
examples of applications that are portable between GNUstep and Mac
OS X.</p><p>Going the other way, more care should be taken when porting
applications from Mac OS X to GNUstep. First, you have to redo the
user interface of the application using Gorm. Secondly, GNUstep
currently does not provide an implementation of some Cocoa classes
like NSToolbar, NSDrawer or any core foundation services. To avoid
problems when porting a Mac OS X application using those
unimplemented functionalities to GNUstep, you will need to use
conditional compilation. Finally, one or more GNU Makefiles must be
created in order to compile the application under GNUstep.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e5580.0x26d6e60"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>As we have seen in this article, developing a GNUstep
application is relatively easy. GNUstep offers a rich, clean and
consistent API for developing true cross-platform applications in
the Objective-C language.</p><p>New application kit back ends are being developed for
Microsoft Windows, DirectFB and Ghostscript, thus allowing support
for a wider range of computing environments. Also, OpenGL support
has recently been added through the implementation of the
NSOpenGLView class.</p><p>Finally, GNUstep-based distributions are emerging. For
example, the LinuxSTEP Project aims to create a fully integrated,
desktop Linux operating environment that is not bound by some of
the more traditional approaches of common Linux
distributions.</p><p>All listings referred in this article are available by
