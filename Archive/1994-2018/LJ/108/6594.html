    Variety being the spice of life and all that, the <i  >LJ</i> site
    offers a little something for everyone.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x209f580.0x21973a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Being eclectic is a good thing, even
though the word often is said in a tone of voice usually reserved
for words like &ldquo;lice&rdquo; and &ldquo;spellcheck&rdquo;. The <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site, however, prides itself on being a
compendium of topics related to open-source, free software and, of
course, Linux. In any given week, a visitor might find articles
ranging from hardware reviews to lessons in spam filtering to
how-tos for building one's own VPN gateway. It may sound obvious,
but a lot of people are using Linux to do a lot of different
things. Our site attempts to provide articles that explain how to
do what you're dying to try, as well as introduce topics and
projects with which you might not be familiar. We might even be
able to help you win an argument.
</p><p>Say, for instance, someone is giving you the old line about
Linux being too hard to use. Point them to &ldquo;Interview with a
Grandmother&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6562.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6562</a>
), in which Joe Klemmer talks to his mom about her experience with
OEone's HomeBase Linux system. Not only is it so easy the
proverbial grandmother can use it, this real grandmother uses her
computer &ldquo;ever so much more than before&rdquo;.</p><p>Back in early January 2003, senior editor and business
reporter Doc Searls prognasticated Linux and open-source events for
2003 in &ldquo;Which Major PC Vendor Will Sell Desktop Linux First?&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6548.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6548</a>).
As the title indicates, Doc feels this is the year Linux on the
desktop will show up in a major way, thanks to the support of some
major vendors. Is he right? Also, be sure to check out the
predictions and comments offered by readers at the end of the
article.</p><p>Finally, it wouldn't be <i  >LJ</i> if we did not
have at least one security article. In &ldquo;Security with PHP
Superglobals&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6559.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6559</a>),
David Lechnyr describes his desire to make after-the-deadline
on-line reservations for ski equipment and how easy that turned out
to be thanks to the site's use of GET statements. If the site had
used PHP superglobals, which allow users &ldquo;to specify which
variables received by a specific method should be used&rdquo;, it would
have been more secure, but he wouldn't have had skis waiting the
next morning.</p><p>Just like having a music collection with a little Ella, a
little Hank, some Buzzcocks and the essential Who is a good thing,
so is having a web site with a little bit of everything&mdash;I mean,
you'd rather be eclectic than boring, right?</p><p>Remember to check the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web
site often; new articles are posted daily. If you want to write an
