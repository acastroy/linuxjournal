    If you're self-employed or run a small shop, here are some
    office applications you should be using.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe3d450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In a recent article, an author asked a
question: &ldquo;Is Linux ready for mission-critical production
environments in the enterprise?&rdquo; His answer was an unqualified
yes, which shouldn't be too surprising. Anyone who has ever heard
of Linux knows of its legendary strengths in the server space. A
better question&mdash;at least from a writer's perspective&mdash;would be:
&ldquo;Is Linux ready to handle the day-to-day demands of a small,
home-based writing or consulting business that doesn't have an IT
staff?&rdquo;
</p><p>Improved hardware detection and ease-of-use distributions
such as Mandrake, SuSE and Red Hat have helped Linux make its way
onto more desktops than ever before. Add to this the constant
refinement of Linux applications, such as office suites, e-mail
clients, contact managers, fax clients, web browsers and financial
software, and you have a system that places viable alternatives
into the hands of every writer and consultant.</p><p>I made this discovery almost a year ago. In the spring of
2002, I took inventory of the software I used to run my commercial
writing business and found that Linux provided me with a viable,
free alternative to every proprietary application I used. This
fact, combined with the stability and security of Linux, made the
decision to move my small business to the platform an easy one. And
I haven't looked back.</p><p>Maybe you're a writer or consultant who is seriously thinking
about alternatives, as I once did. Or perhaps you've heard of Linux
but aren't sure exactly which applications to use. In this article,
I provide an overview of four programs found in any Linux
distribution that a writer or consultant can use to run a business.
Space does not allow me to cover every feature of each application.
But I hope to cover enough of the basics so the reader has a good
feel for what these applications can do and how they can be used in
a small business.</p><p>The Linux applications I'm about to discuss may not have all
of the features of their proprietary counterparts. That is,
applications provided under Linux have the same functionality but
not necessarily the same bells and whistles. We shouldn't be
concerned with bells and whistles here, but rather with using tools
that allow us to get our work done at a relatively low cost and in
a stable, secure environment. If that's what you're looking for,
read on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe3d6b8"></a>Tools of the Trade</h2></div></div><p>A small writing or consulting business has minimum
requirements where software is concerned. I suppose that's one of
the perks of this type of endeavor. The following applications are
typically the most commonly used in the operation of a small,
home-based writing or consulting business: an office suite, a
contact manager/e-mail client, a web browser and financial
software. Anything more is gingerbread.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe3d7c0"></a>OpenOffice.org</h2></div></div><p>OpenOffice.org is my office suite of choice. It is 100% open
source, runs on several platforms and is freely available at
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_self">www.openoffice.org</a>.
One of the OpenOffice.org suite's greatest strengths is its use of
XML-based file formats. XML is a structured metalanguage that
easily can encapsulate files for distribution between computer
systems that otherwise would be incompatible. So, the longevity of
your data is guaranteed.</p><p>The OpenOffice.org suite consists of four different
applications: OpenOffice.org Writer, OpenOffice.org Calc,
OpenOffice.org Impress and OpenOffice.org Draw.</p><p>OpenOffice.org's Writer is the word processor in the suite.
Its interface has a familiar look and feel; it's similar to
Microsoft Word and Sun's StarOffice Writer (Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Doing My Assignment
</p></div></div><p>As a commercial writer I use only about 10-15% of a word
processor's power. My clients do most of the graphic design and
formatting. From business letters and proposals to articles and
books, OpenOffice.org Writer is more than enough to get my work
done.</p><p>The Writer interface is intuitive and laid out in a manner
conducive to finding what I need when I need it. It has everything
necessary for today's established freelance writer/consultant and
then some, and it saves data in several file formats, including
Microsoft Word 6, Microsoft Word 95, Microsoft Word 97/2000/XP,
rich text format (RTF) and StarWriter 5 (an early StarOffice file
format). It even exports PDFs.</p><p>One caveat: if you use a lot of tables or special formatting,
some of it may be lost or garbled when exporting to Microsoft Word
or another office suite. A good rule of thumb is the simpler your
layout, the better its compatibility with other word
processors.</p><p>Because the needs of a writer are few, I hardly use the other
programs in the OpenOffice.org suite. But as far as spreadsheets
go, OpenOffice.org's Calc has all of the ordinary features one
would expect in a spreadsheet, including autosum, autoformat,
graphs and many other functions. It saves work in Microsoft Excel,
StarCalc, the Data Interchange Format and, of course, in its own
format (Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The OpenOffice.org Calc Spreadsheet
</p></div></div><p>OpenOffice.org's Impress, a presentation program, has all of
the basic features of Microsoft PowerPoint, but it lacks templates.
This lack of templates makes more work for you when designing
presentations. Impress reads and writes PowerPoint, StarImpress and
its own file format (Figure 3).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Building a Presentation
</p></div></div><p>The drawing application, Draw, has all of the usual graphic
features, including the ability to read the most common types of
graphic files. It saves to OpenOffice.org's Draw format and the
StarDraw format, and it is good for basic needs (Figure 4).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe3e2c0"></a>Contact Manager/E-Mail Client</h2></div></div><p>Although Linux has many available options for both contact
managers and e-mail, I prefer to combine them. Doing so makes
things more convenient&mdash;everything is right there, so I don't have
to open two different applications. Ximian Evolution fills this
need quite nicely. It is at once an e-mail client and a contact
manager/task scheduler, and it provides the writer/consultant with
a one-stop information resource. Upon starting the program for the
first time, you will be taken to the summary screen (Figure
5).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f5.large.jpg"><img src="6543f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Starting Ximian Evolution</p></div></div>
</p><p>Along with weather information and a listing of recent
articles about Linux, Evolution shows how many messages are in your
inbox and outbox. It also shows any pending tasks or appointments
for the day. Down the left-hand side of the Summary Window are the
different areas within Evolution that allow you to set up
appointments, schedule tasks and send and receive e-mail. Clicking
the Inbox icon will take you to Evolution's e-mail client (Figure
6).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f6.large.jpg"><img src="6543f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Checking the Inbox</p></div></div>
</p><p>Evolution has a look and feel similar to Microsoft's Outlook
program. All of the usual e-mail buttons and services are listed
across the top of the page. One nice feature with the release of
Evolution 1.2.1 is the New button. With a click, you can create a
new mail message or contact without having to navigate to that
specific area of Evolution.</p><p>With Evolution's contact client, contacts are easily created
and managed (Figure 7). I can enter the usual name, address, phone
number and so on, but I also can click on the details panel and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>viol&agrave;</em></span>! I have another screen to record
additional information. And, the more information I have on
clients, the better my ability to communicate with them. In case
you're wondering, the collaboration panel allows you to record the
URLs for those clients who publish their calendar information on
the Internet. It's another example of how Evolution's developers
have put a lot of thought into the components of this
program.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f7.large.jpg"><img src="6543f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. A Contact in Evolution</p></div></div>
</p><p>Once I build a list of contacts, I can search the list based
on any number of different search criteria: alphabetical order,
e-mail address or category (Figure 8). You even can create your own
search criteria using the Advanced selection. You then can file
contacts under any category you choose and search for them
accordingly. For me, this makes prospecting a snap.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Classifying a Contact
</p></div></div><p>The Calendar client (Figure 9) is pretty straightforward, and
you can set up the calendar window to suit your tastes. The window
areas can be changed simply by dragging the borders to the desired
size. Once you've navigated to the desired day, double-click on the
appointment time and a separate window opens up (Figure 10). You
then can fill in the details of your appointment and store it for
later viewing. You also can set up your calendar to remind you
several minutes, hours or days in advance of an appointment.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p><p>The Task Scheduler works in a similar fashion. Navigate to
the New button and choose task. A window opens up that allows you
to type in the details of your task. The tasks are stored in the
&ldquo;task&rdquo; area of Evolution and can be displayed in order of time
and date, allowing you to see whether you are on track in a project
or group of tasks. Also, once a task is completed, you can check it
off and know exactly what you have finished as well as what else
you have left to do.</p><p>Several more features are available that you can explore for
yourself. Like Linux, Evolution allows you to accomplish the same
task in several different ways.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe35ac8"></a>A Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>By far, two of the most popular web browsers are Mozilla
(Figure 11)--based upon the same rendering engine as its commercial
counterpart, Netscape Navigator&mdash;and Galeon (Figure 12), a web
browser that sports many of the same features as Mozilla and is
part of the GNOME desktop.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f11.large.jpg"><img src="6543f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Mozilla
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f12.large.jpg"><img src="6543f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Galeon
</p></div></div><p>In addition to these two browsers, Linux also offers
Konqueror, the KDE-based file manager/web browser. Most Linux
browsers support 128-bit encryption for secure transactions.</p><p>Speaking of transactions, it's usually a good idea to have
more than one web browser available. The reason? Web site access.
At first, you think a browser is a browser; other than the look and
feel, they all do the same thing. Even though it is popular,
Mozilla lacks a feature that Konqueror has: changeable user
agents.</p><p>When you connect to a web site, your browser identifies
itself to the server, offering its name, version number and the
system on which it is running. Though most web sites are browser
agnostic, some will give you a hard time if you do not have a
certain kind of browser.</p><p>For instance, every time I tried to log in to my telephone
company's web site I always had problems. The site never let me get
past a certain point. After scratching my head for a while, I
remembered hearing reports of some web sites not supporting
browsers other than Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f13.large.jpg"><img src="6543f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 13. Konqueror's User Agent
Feature</p></div></div>
</p><p>This is where the User Agent comes in (Figure 13). I simply
changed my web browser's identity to Internet Explorer 5.0, and my
web site transaction went through without a hitch. You won't run
into this situation too often, but if you do, try changing the user
agent and see what happens. Again, this demonstrates how Linux
offers the user many different ways of accomplishing the same task
in addition to tools for overcoming proprietary obstacles.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe36308"></a>Financial Software</h2></div></div><p>Once you earn your money, you need to keep track of it.
Financial software usually fills the need. One of the best-kept
secrets of Linux is the open-source accounting project GnuCash
(Figure 14).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f14.large.jpg"><img src="6543f14.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 14. GnuCash Tracks Your
Dollars</p></div></div>
</p><p>GnuCash is a robust, easy-to-use accounting system that makes
balancing your personal books a snap. And GnuCash's Setup Wizard
allows you to set up multiple accounts with different opening
balances, simply by answering a few questions and making a few
selections (Figure 15).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6543f15.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 15. GnuCash Setup
</p></div></div><p>Although GnuCash sports features of its proprietary
counterparts, such as transaction auto-completion and check number
auto-increment, it uses double-entry accounting, like professional
accountants and enterprise accounting software.</p><p>The idea behind a double-entry system is that there is a
debit from an account and a credit to an account for each
transaction. This way, you know where the money came from and where
it went. For instance, if I want to pay for some business-related
books, I would debit my savings account and credit an expense
account for books (Figure 16). This is an invaluable tool when you
need to find out where all of your money went.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f16.large.jpg"><img src="6543f16.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 16. Where Did the Money Go?
</p></div></div><p>What is really nice about GnuCash is you can customize it to
suit your personal financial situation. A list of common accounts
comes ready-made&mdash;expenses, income, stocks, investments&mdash;each with
its own sub-account structure. However, you also can add your own
accounts and delete those you don't use (Figure 17).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6543f17.large.jpg"><img src="6543f17.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 17. Customizing the Accounts</p></div></div>
</p><p>Another nice feature of GnuCash is the ability to split
transactions, so you can include several debit or credit accounts
in a transaction. This allows you to fine-tune a transaction and
show every account involved in a specific financial
activity.</p><p>Lastly, GnuCash has several graphical reports that show at a
glance your net worth, your income, your expenses, profit-loss and
so on. This alone allows you to manage your finances with greater
precision.</p><p>Many more features&mdash;too numerous to mention here&mdash;come with
GnuCash, but suffice it to say that for a one-person shop, GnuCash
has all of the features you need and then some.</p><p>At the time of this writing, GnuCash is at release 1.6.7 and
is designed to be used for personal finances. No business features,
such as customer and vendor tracking or invoicing and bill payment,
exist. But you can customize GnuCash to balance the books for a
small business with a little tweaking, as mentioned previously.
With the release of GnuCash 1.8, small-business accounting features
will be available, including invoicing and bill payment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd45580.0xe36e60"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If you are currently using a proprietary operating system and
proprietary applications and have decided to make the switch to the
security, stability and freedom of Linux, I welcome you, and I
consider my mission accomplished.</p></div></div>
