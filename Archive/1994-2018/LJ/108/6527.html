December 2002], Pradeep Padala talked about injecting code into a
process and finding some &ldquo;free space&rdquo; to put it in to. It's worth
noting that the space referred to is not really &ldquo;free&rdquo;; it's
usually either the cleared space used for global storage in the
executable and its shared libraries or the C library's heap storage
area. In any case, writing over this data and not restoring it
before allowing the execution to continue (as may seem reasonable
at first) could cause all sorts of weird behaviour, including
program crashes.</p><p>&mdash;Shaun Clowes</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a66580.0x2b5e558"></a>FreeS/WAN Updates</h2></div></div><p>Just got my January 2003 issue of <i  >LJ</i> and
was quite surprised to see a FreeS/WAN article included&mdash;nice work!
I was really happy to see you used the RSASigs in the examples
instead of preshared secrets, a welcome change from the usual and
insecure examples I've read in the past. I maintain
<a href="http://www.freeswan.ca" target="_self">www.freeswan.ca</a>, an
alternate source of information, patches and prepatched versions of
FreeS/WAN for interoperation with many devices. Freeswan.org now
ships RPMs for Red Hat 7.x and 8.x for all kernel combinations.
These include only the ipsec.o modules and user-land tools and
don't replace your vmlinuz and grub/lilo configs. Folks should
update to 1.99, as there was a serious denial-of-service flaw that
is now fixed.</p><p>&mdash;Ken Bantoft</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mick's reply:</b></span> Thanks very

it. The GCJ, Screen and DDD/quicksort articles shed more light into
the daily use of our beloved Linux platform. Please keep us

a study of olive penguins and a cheeseball igloo served at a party.

the thought behind the GNU/Linux and other free, open-source
software movements (&ldquo;Back to Brazil&rdquo;, Letters, February 2003).
The heavy reluctance against land reform is the root cause of
fundamental socioeconomic problems in many parts of the globe,
including Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and South America and
Africa. I believe land reform movements in these countries share
the same vein that the Linux/GNU movement has. Our country, Japan,
had been coerced into doing a total land reform by the US
occupation policy in 1940s. It liberated not only the land but the
minds of so many common people, enabling the making of the world's
second biggest economy and modern industry.</p><p>&mdash;Hiroshi Iwatani</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a66580.0x2b5f210"></a>Origin of &ldquo;Wardriving&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>In two articles [<i  >LJ</i>, September 2002],
Doc Searls incorrectly claims that the terms &ldquo;wardriving&rdquo; and
&ldquo;warchalking&rdquo; were derived from the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>War
Games</em></span>. I believe they actually were derived from the
term &ldquo;war dialing&rdquo;, the process of sequentially dialing a range
of phone numbers in search of a modem connect tone. War dialers
were utilities that could be left to run and accumulate interesting
numbers to be investigated later. These programs were the
equivalent of today's internet port scanners.</p><p>&mdash;Jonathan Hutchins</p><p>War Games came out in 1983, and we don't know of an example
of the term &ldquo;wardialing&rdquo; before that. Although the other &ldquo;war&rdquo;
terms are derived from &ldquo;wardialing&rdquo;, it's likely that
&ldquo;wardialing&rdquo; came from the movie. Wardialing is still a threat

a cup of coffee that this is due to the infusion of money from big
business. Don't we have a wacky penguin? Don't we have XBill? Isn't
that funny stuff? The answer is a qualified yes. It's funny, but
it's funny in the same regard that recess is fun&mdash;that being
because it is at a set time and place and supervised. But Linux
never had a recess time before. You could play all day and still
get everything done. It's time to get off our collective asses and
put the fun back in Linux.</p><p>&mdash;Mutant</p><p>You can't spell FUN without U.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a66580.0x2b5fb58"></a>What Happened to the Thick
