    A new general framework offers much-needed crypto services
    to all parts of the kernel.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x28254a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article provides a brief overview of
the new cryptographic API for the Linux kernel. It is aimed at
anyone with a technical interest in Linux, such as system
administrators, and other curious people who would like to gain
insight into the API's design, implementation and application. Some
knowledge of kernel internals is useful but not essential for a
broad understanding of API concepts.
</p><p>The history of this API is short. Not long before the
Halloween 2002 kernel feature-freeze, an IPSec implementation being
developed by Dave Miller and Alexey Kuznetzov became slated for
inclusion into the 2.6 kernel. IPSec requires cryptographic support
within the kernel, which along with an increasing general need for
kernel cryptography, prompted the development of a new
cryptographic API.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x2825608"></a>Design</h2></div></div><p>Although initially aimed at supporting IPSec, the API has
been designed as a general-purpose facility, with potential
applications including encrypted files, encrypted filesystems,
strong filesystem integrity, the random character device
(/dev/random), network filesystem security (for example, CIFS) and
other kernel networking services requiring cryptography.
</p><p>A specific design requirement was that the API work directly
in place on page vectors. A page is the primary unit of memory
managed by the kernel. A page vector-based API allows for deep
integration with kernel substructures, such as the VFS and
networking stack, as well for as scatter-gather operations. In the
case of IPSec, cryptographic transforms may be applied directly to
discontiguous memory pages associated with network packets.</p><p>Simplicity was a significant design goal, which is always a
good idea in general, and particularly important for kernel and
security code.</p><p>Deployment flexibility was another goal. For example, the API
has a flexible policy toward algorithms; they can be loaded
dynamically as kernel modules, without the API needing to know
anything about them in advance.</p><p>Future design goals include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Hardware support for cryptographic accelerator
cards and NICs with IPSec offload.</p></li><li><p>Support for specification of algorithm preferences
when multiple implementations are available, for example, optimized
assembler versions and various hardware implementations.</p></li><li><p>Asymmetric cryptography support (RSA), which may be
needed in the kernel to support multicast IPSec and kernel module
signature verification. This may be a contentious issue, as
asymmetric cryptography is generally slow and complicated&mdash;both are
very good reasons to exclude it from the kernel.</p></li><li><p>A unified API for user-space applications wishing
to utilize available cryptographic hardware, such as SSL, IPSec key
exchange, secure routing protocols and DNSSec.</p></li><li><p>Further optimizing the API memory footprint to
cater to embedded systems scenarios.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x2825c38"></a>Algorithms</h2></div></div><p>Three types of algorithms are currently supported by the
API:</p><p>1) Digests (one-way hash functions)--these take arbitrary
messages and produce short, fixed-length message digests. To be
one-way, the hash function must be designed so it is easy to
generate the hash but difficult to compute the original message
from the hash. For cryptographic purposes, hash functions need to
be collision-resistant, so that it is difficult for two messages to
hash to the same value. Applications include ensuring data
integrity and generating message authentication codes for network
protocols. Examples of digest algorithms are MD5 and SHA1.</p><p>A message authentication scheme called HMAC (RFC2104) is
included within the API, which will operate on any standard digest
algorithm. This is currently used to generate authentication data
for IPSec packets.</p><p>2) Ciphers&mdash;these algorithms implement symmetric key
encryption, where a plain-text message is encrypted with a key to
produce ciphertext. Generally, the same key is used to decrypt the
ciphertext back into the original plain text. It should be easy to
encrypt and decrypt messages with the key (which must be kept
secret) but difficult to do so without it. Applications include
encrypting data to ensure privacy and generation of message
authentication codes. Examples of cipher algorithms are Triple DES,
Blowfish and AES.</p><p>There are two types of ciphers: block ciphers operate on
fixed-length blocks of data (e.g., 16 bytes), and stream ciphers
use a key stream to operate on as little as one bit of data at a
time.</p><p>Ciphers also may operate in a variety of modes, such as
Electronic Codebook (ECB), where each block of plain text is simply
encrypted with the key, and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), where the
previously encrypted block is fed into the encryption of the next
block.</p><p>3) Compression&mdash;this is often used in conjunction with
encryption so that it is more difficult to exploit weaknesses
related to the original plain text as well as to speed up
encryption (i.e., compressed plain text is shorter). By definition,
encrypted data should be difficult to compress, but this adversely
affects performance over links that normally utilize compression.
Compressing data before encryption helps reduce this performance
hit in many cases. Examples of compression algorithms are LZS and
Deflate.</p><p>So far, algorithm implementations from well-known sources
have been adapted for use with the API, as they are more likely to
have been reviewed and widely tested. For inclusion into the
mainline kernel, algorithms generally must be patent-free (e.g.,
IDEA will not be a candidate for inclusion until around 2011),
based on open, recognized standards and submitted with a set of
test vectors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x2825fa8"></a>Page Vectors</h2></div></div><p>Before discussing the API structure, let's briefly look at
memory pages and page vectors. As mentioned previously, a page is
the fundamental unit of memory managed by the kernel (on i386,
pages are 4KB in size). Consider a buffer containing, say, 1,460
bytes of user-space data. It belongs to a specific page in the
kernel, offset from the start of the page by some amount, and has a
length of 1,460 bytes. This buffer can be represented as a
page-based tuple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{ page, offset, length }
</pre><p>An interface, such as the cryptographic API that works
directly with pages, needs to deal with this tuple, or page vector.
An existing kernel data structure called a scatterlist is employed,
which contains a page vector and normally is used for
scatter-gather DMA operations.
</p><p>The cryptographic API uses scatterlists to operate on arrays
of discontiguous page vectors. The primary purpose of
scatter-gather in the kernel is to avoid unnecessary copying of
data. It also seems to result in cleaner code. Many readers will be
familiar with scatter-gather I/O in the form of the readv() and
writev() system calls. The kernel cryptographic API uses the same
general concept but operates on pages instead of plain memory
buffers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x28261b8"></a>API Structure</h2></div></div><p>The API deals with two primary objects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Algorithm implementations&mdash;kernel modules that
contain the underlying algorithm code.</p></li><li><p>Transforms&mdash;objects that instantiate algorithms,
manage internal state and handle common implementation logic.
Transforms are managed by crypto_alloc_tfm() and crypto_free_tfm().
A set of API wrappers are provided to simplify transform use and to
allow the properties of a transform's underlying algorithm to be
queried.</p></li></ul></div><p>The following pseudo-code demonstrates a typical use of the
transform interface, where some kernel code needs to encrypt data
using the Blowfish cipher in electronic codebook (ECB) mode:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tfm = crypto_alloc_tfm("blowfish",
                       CRYPTO_TFM_MODE_ECB);
crypto_cipher_setkey(tfm, key, keylength);
crypto_cipher_encrypt(tfm, &amp;scatterlist,
                      numlists);
crypto_free_tfm(tfm);
</pre><p>As shown in Figure 1, the API is layered so that core logic
is hidden from cryptography users and algorithm implementors. This
core logic includes generic transform management, scatterlist
manipulation and abstraction of underlying algorithms. Further
down, per-algorithm-type logic is handled, such as cipher
processing modes and utilizing digests for generating message
authentication codes.

API</p></div></div>
</p><p>The algorithm management layer contains logic for locating,
loading and reference counting algorithm implementations. The
latter is required to prevent nasty things from happening if an
attempt is made to unload an algorithm module that is still in
use.</p><p>An algorithm runtime query interface is provided so that
calling code can determine which algorithms are available on the
system. This is primarily intended for use by key negotiation
protocols, such as ISAKMP/IKE.</p><p>Finally, the algorithm registration interface allows modules
to register one or more algorithms, specifying various properties
such as the name of the algorithm, its block size and minimum and
maximum key sizes. The list of currently registered algorithms and
their properties may be viewed in /proc/crypto.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x2826898"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>This is still a young API that is likely to evolve somewhat,
especially if some of the future design goals listed here are
implemented.</p><p>In terms of API users, IPSec works and performs well,
especially for a first cut with no performance optimizations.
Existing kernel components that need cryptography are expected to
convert to the new API over time, and hopefully, cool new projects
will be developed because of it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272d580.0x28269f8"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>Many thanks to David Miller and Nancy Chan for reviewing this
