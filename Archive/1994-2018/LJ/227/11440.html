Kyle returns to his quest to control a beer fridge with ever cheaper and
smaller Linux devices. Today's candidate is a Raspberry Pi.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e8580.0x18e03b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It was inevitable. Back when the Raspberry Pi was announced, I knew 
I eventually would use one to power a beer fridge. If you have been
following my column through the years, you know that three years ago
(see my Hack and / column titled &ldquo;Temper Temper&rdquo; in the August
2010 issue, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10809" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10809</a>), I set up a temperature controller
for my beer fermenting fridge with an X10 serial controller to control
the power to the fridge and a heating pad, an inexpensive TEMPer USB
thermometer to take the fridge temperature, and a simple Perl script.
</p><p>
As described in the original article, everything was connected to a spare Debian laptop
I had lying around, and the setup worked great. Every minute, my Perl
script would launch, take the temperature and control the power to a
heating pad at the bottom of the fridge or the fridge itself, depending on
whether it needed to be warmer or cooler. A few months later (see my December
2010 Hack and / column &ldquo;Working on My Temper&rdquo;, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10904" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10904</a>), I decided that the laptop
was overkill for this use case, so I replaced it with a low-power Pogoplug
NAS device that was modified to boot Plugbox Linux, an Arch derivative.
The Pogoplug has been powering my beer fridge reliably ever since.
</p><p>
That brings us to today. I just happened to have a spare insulated
cabinet on the other side of the garage that I wanted to use as excess
fermentation capacity. Unfortunately, the cabinet is too far away from
the fridge for me to use the Pogoplug with an additional temperature
probe, so I had to work out a different solution. I happened to have a
spare Raspberry Pi lying around and realized it would be perfect for the
job. All I needed to do was buy a new TEMPer USB probe and copy over
my Perl script. The only big change I'd need was to have the script
<tt  >ssh</tt>
back in to the Pogoplug so it could control the X10 devices (I have
only one X10 serial adapter).

Prepare the Raspberry Pi</h2></div></div><p>
I didn't really need anything fancy for this setup. In fact, Arduino fans
who read this probably would say that even the Raspberry Pi is overkill
for such a simple project. I decided to use the standard Raspbian
&ldquo;wheezy&rdquo;
Debian distribution. This procedure has been documented many times before,
so I won't document it here. Because I was using a Debian-based release,
I figured I even could follow the same steps from my original &ldquo;Temper
Temper&rdquo; column.

New TEMPer Thermometers</h2></div></div><p>
The problem with cheap electronics is that sometimes the internals change
without your knowing. Apparently, there are different USB thermometers all
under the TEMPer name with the same packaging and overall look. Although
I'm sure they all work with their included Windows software, it turns
out that they need completely different software under Linux. Wouldn't you
know it, the second TEMPer probe I bought turned out to be a different
revision, so it requires a completely different set of software.
</p><p>
You can tell which TEMPer thermometer you have with
<tt  >dmesg</tt> and <tt  >lsusb</tt>. If
the <tt  >dmesg</tt> output looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

steps from my original &ldquo;Temper Temper&rdquo; column.

Temper.py</h2></div></div><p>
The original software project to control these new-style TEMPer probes was
at http://www.isp-sl.com/pcsensor-1.0.0.tgz, but right before I started
writing this article, I got word from Philipp Adelt that he had updated
that project recently to work with Python. The updated project is hosted
on Github at <a href="https://github.com/padelt/pcsensor-temper" target="_self">https://github.com/padelt/pcsensor-temper</a>, and the Python
version is at <a href="https://github.com/padelt/temper-python" target="_self">https://github.com/padelt/temper-python</a> and has additional
features, such as multiple probe management and SNMP support. So to get
started with this project, I first needed to install git and then install
a few Python libraries to provide USB support:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install git python-usb
</pre>
</p><p>
(Note that the project page also tells you to install the
python-setuptools package and the snmp-passpersist Python library, but
as I'm not planning to use SNMP, I skipped that step.)
</p><p>
With git installed, I pulled down the latest release of
temper-python:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone git://github.com/padelt/temper-python.git
Cloning into 'temper-python'...
remote: Counting objects: 17, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (13/13), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (17/17), 19.07 KiB, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.
</pre>
</p><p>
The main Python program can be found under temper-python/src/temper.py,
and the project also includes a sample udev rule you can copy to
/etc/udev/rules.d if you want access to the TEMPer probe by a user other
than root. I my case, I was fine with root-only access, so I left the udev
rules alone.
</p><p>
If you install the python-usb libraries correctly, and you have the
supported TEMPer device, you should see output like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./temper-python/src/temper.py 
Found 1 devices
Device #0: 17.6&deg;C 63.7&deg;F
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you see this, you know the temperature probe is working. I don't
like running system programs like this within a home directory, so I
decided to copy it up to /usr/local/sbin:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo cp ./temper-python/src/temper.py /usr/local/sbin/
</pre>
</p><p>
Now in my case, I wanted to act on this temperature output, and I realized
that my old temper.pl wrapper script wasn't going to cut it. Although
I certainly could just modify it a bit to work with the new output,
I figured a Perl script that called a Python script was just asking
for too much hate mail. Instead, I decided to write a new simple wrapper
script in bash called /usr/local/sbin/temper:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

TEMP_MIN="55"
TEMP_MAX="65"

LOGFILE='/var/log/temper.log'
TIME=`date +"%b %d %T"`
TEMPERATURE=`/usr/local/sbin/temper.py 2&gt;/dev/null | 
 &#8618;tail -n1 | cut -f4 -d ' ' | sed 's/.F$//'`

if [[ $TEMPERATURE == "" ]]; then
  echo ERROR
  exit 1
fi

# B6 = peltier cooler B7 = heater

if [[ $TEMPERATURE &lt; $(( $TEMP_MIN - 1 )) ]]; then
  ssh pogoplug "/usr/local/bin/br --port /dev/ttyUSB0 B7 ON"
  ssh pogoplug "/usr/local/bin/br --port /dev/ttyUSB0 B6 OFF"
  echo -e "$TIME\t$TEMPERATURE\tHON" &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE
elif [[ $TEMPERATURE &lt; $TEMP_MIN ]]; then
  ssh pogoplug "/usr/local/bin/br --port /dev/ttyUSB0 B6 OFF"
  ssh pogoplug "/usr/local/bin/br --port /dev/ttyUSB0 B7 OFF"
  echo -e "$TIME\t$TEMPERATURE\tOFF" &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE
elif [[ $TEMPERATURE &gt; $TEMP_MAX ]]; then
  ssh pogoplug "/usr/local/bin/br --port /dev/ttyUSB0 B6 ON"
  ssh pogoplug "/usr/local/bin/br --port /dev/ttyUSB0 B7 OFF"
  echo -e "$TIME\t$TEMPERATURE\tCON" &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE
else
  echo -e "$TIME\t$TEMPERATURE\t" &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Although the logic of this script is similar to my old temper.pl, I just call
the temper.py script and use some pipes to pull out the temperature data I
need. In this case, I also have to <tt  >ssh</tt> back to my
machine named &ldquo;pogoplug&rdquo;
to run /usr/local/bin/br (the bottlerocket software that controls my
X10 devices). This means I need to run <tt  >ssh-keygen</tt> as the root user and
then run <tt  >ssh-copy-id</tt> to copy my public key to the pogoplug host. If I
had wanted to replace my existing Pogoplug with a Raspberry Pi, I could
just <tt  >apt-get install</tt> bottlerocket, connect a USB-to-serial adapter with
my X10 serial controller and run the br commands directly.
</p><p>
The final step is set up a cronjob. For that, I just create a file in
called /etc/cron.d/temper with these contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* *  * * *  root /usr/local/sbin/temper 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>
</p><p>
With that file in place, every minute, my script will probe the temperature
and control the power to extra X10 appliances I have in place via the
Pogoplug. It seems like I keep replacing these temperature probe systems
with simpler and cheaper Linux machines. I wonder what's next?
