With Vagrant and Salt Stack, you can have identical development environments
and share them across local, development, stage and production using small
text configuration files.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f981f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What if, just like Bill Murray in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Groundhog Day</em></span>, you could wake up
to a fresh and identical development environment completely free of
yesterday's experiments and mistakes?
Vagrant lets you do exactly that.
</p><p>
Or, what if, like Jake Epping in Stephen King's <span   class="emphasis"><em>11/22/63</em></span>, you could make
changes and script the past without fear, play around with some new
Drupal modules, and quickly reset everything just by leaving and then
walking back down the stairs of the pantry again?
</p><p>
Would you like to automate the creation and installation of a pristine
Drupal environment, instead of manually installing Apache, PHP and all
of the needed libraries?
</p><p>
Recently, I read a post from Treehouse
Agency titled, &ldquo;End 'Works on My Machine' Surprises with
Vagrant&rdquo; (<a href="http://treehouseagency.com/blog/steven-merrill/2011/11/02/end-works-my-machine-surprises-vagrant" target="_self">treehouseagency.com/blog/steven-merrill/2011/11/02/end-works-my-machine-surprises-vagrant</a>),
which is about using Vagrant and Puppet for Drupal development. You may have seen
it as well on Drupal Planet (<a href="http://planet.drupal.org" target="_self">planet.drupal.org</a>) and wondered
about the benefits described there.
</p><p>
This is a great technique that outlines using various tools to 
build a consistent development environment quickly that is repeatable and
shareable with everyone on your team.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> also recently featured an
article that introduced Vagrant (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/introducing-vagrant" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/introducing-vagrant</a>).
After you're finished here, I urge you to
go read that one too, because it offers more general information about
Vagrant itself.
</p><p>
Salt Stack (<a href="http://salstack.org" target="_self">salstack.org</a>) is a tool similar
to Puppet, but it's powered by Python, instead of Ruby. If you are interested
in standalone Salt installation and use, check out my November
2012 <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> article on that topic (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/getting-started-salt-stack-other-configuration-management-system-built-python" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/getting-started-salt-stack-other-configuration-management-system-built-python</a>),
where I introduce Salt Stack and show how
to install it to control one or thousands of other machines. I won't
go in depth into Salt's installation here, because Salty-Vagrant takes
care of all of that for you.
</p><p>
I've been using Salt,
Vagrant (<a href="http://vagrantup.com" target="_self">vagrantup.com</a>) and a Vagrant gem called
Salty-Vagrant (<a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant" target="_self">https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant</a>) for Drupal
development quite a bit lately. I've found that having a standard
configuration that mirrors my development, testing, staging and
production environments has streamlined my workflow and helped prevent
a lot of the unknowns between different stages of the Drupal development
life cycle. I've been able to minimize a lot of the errors and headaches
that come with integrating multiple software stacks
and speed up my workflow too.
</p><p>
I also enjoy being able to try new things quickly and easily without
spending hours reconfiguring and re-installing the entire software stack
needed for Drupal development.
</p><p>
I then can share these configurations quickly and easily with other
developers on my team and know that we are each working with the
same versions of software already installed.
In this article, I describe how you can do that too.
</p><p>
With Salt Stack, you store your configurations in text files,
similar to Puppet. The difference is that the configurations rely on
YAML (<a href="http://yaml.org" target="_self">yaml.org</a>) templates instead of Ruby code. This makes them
easy for humans to read, even if they aren't Python coders.
</p><p>
These configurations can be used to launch development machines, as
well as testing, staging and production machines&mdash;and all of them
are identical and easily transportable. I use Git to
manage my team's configurations. This brings all of the great aspects
of version control to my server configurations too.
</p><p>
With Vagrant, you easily can delete a development environment and then
re-create it in about as much time as it takes for the server to boot and
install the packages and software you specify&mdash;kind of like a quick undo
or reset button.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f98ca0"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
You need to download and install a few things to get all of these
pieces to work together. Each component has very good documentation
on-line for installation and use, so I won't duplicate the instructions
here. Instead, follow the links for each piece of software and check
the projects' sites for the most up-to-date information.
</p><p>
This article focuses on using an Ubuntu-based 64-bit VirtualBox, but
Salty-Vagrant with Salt Stack supports BSD, Red Hat, OS X and Windows
virtual machines as well.
</p><p>
The beauty of using Vagrant with Salty-Vagrant is that the configuration
files, also known as SLS files, transfer exactly to production servers,
as well as anywhere else you might use them. The benefit of creating one
template and then re-using it again and again can help you direct more energy
toward Drupal development, instead of troubleshooting server-software
installation too.
</p><p>
You need to do this installation and configuration only once. After
that, it is as simple as <tt  >vagrant up</tt>!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f98f60"></a>
Install VirtualBox</h2></div></div><p>
VirtualBox allows you to run a guest operating system inside your own host
operating system. It is similar to dual-booting, except you still
can use your main operating system and have access to additional running
operating systems as well. For example, you can run an Ubuntu server
inside your Windows, Mac or Linux host operating system and still
access your e-mail and text editor from your native host operating system.
</p><p>
Follow the instructions at <a href="http://virtualbox.org" target="_self">virtualbox.org</a> to
install VirtualBox. Versions are available for most major operating
systems. A major portion of popular Linux distributions also
have packages available through their respective package managers. This
is the most effective and efficient way to install the majority of
tools I describe here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f99118"></a>
Install Vagrant</h2></div></div><p>
Vagrant is a Ruby gem that allows you to
create and destroy virtual machines quickly, and then reset them almost
instantly.
</p><p>
Gems are like Drupal modules, but for the Ruby programming language. These
plugins let you extend Ruby's functionality and add additional
capabilities. You should ensure that you have a recent version of Ruby
installed. I recommend using your package manager if you don't have it,
but a lot of distributions include Ruby already, so you likely won't need
to install it. You easily can find out whether you have Ruby installed
by typing <tt  >ruby --version</tt> from your terminal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f992d0"></a>
Install Salty-Vagrant</h2></div></div><p>
Salty-Vagrant is another
Ruby gem that brings the functionality and automated configuration tools
of Salt Stack to Vagrant. Salty-Vagrant acts as a bridge between the
Salt Stack configuration management system and Vagrant/VirtualBox. The
project's page has installation instructions that are updated on a regular
basis. It would be a good idea to refer to these instructions just in case
something has changed after this article is published. If you know
a little Ruby or shell scripting, feel free to join in this open-source
project and help contribute back. You'll find the development community
to be friendly and welcoming.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f993d8"></a>
Get the Base Box</h2></div></div><p>
Get the base box from <a href="http://vagrantbox.es" target="_self">vagrantbox.es</a>.
You'll need a <span   class="emphasis"><em>box</em></span> in which to create and run your environment. Boxes are what
Vagrant uses for your virtual machines, and they are simply virtual machines
that have been configured specifically with Vagrant support. You can
create your own from scratch, but it is much quicker and easier 
just to download a pre-made one that has all of the necessary Vagrant
configurations already set up. I used the precise64 box. This is an
Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit Linux server with the necessary Vagrant tools and
guest additions already in place. You're downloading an entire operating
system, so be patient, because it might take a little while. It usually
is best to download your box and then save it locally somewhere so you
can use it again.
</p><p>
If you're using a 32-bit host operating system, you should instead
download the 32-bit version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f995e8"></a>
Import the Box</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully by this point, you have everything you need. Let's use the
command line to interact with Vagrant and import your new box.
</p><p>
To import your box, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant box add precise64 /path/to/your/downloaded/box
</pre>
</p><p>
Relative path names don't work well here, so if you
downloaded your box to your home directory, you need to type out the
full path&mdash;for example, <tt  >~/bhosmer/precise64.box</tt>
should be typed out like this:
<tt  >/home/bhosmer/precise64.box</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt  >vagrant box add</tt> command creates a copy of your box and stores it so
that Vagrant can access it. This box is used to create the instantiation
of the particular box you happen to be using. The nice part is that you
always can press the &ldquo;reset&rdquo; button by using <tt  >vagrant
destroy</tt> to delete
anything you've done and set it back to its original state before you
started. I go into that in more detail a little later.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x1f99a08"></a>
Launch the Box and Verify the Guest
Additions</h2></div></div><p>
Now, launch your box just to make sure that the VirtualBox guest additions
are up to date. If they aren't, Salty-Vagrant may not work properly.
</p><p>
Where you store your Vagrant configurations is entirely up to you. I
like to keep mine in my home directory under a vagrant folder, just so
I can keep track of the different environments I have.
</p><p>
Create a new directory called salty-vagrant and <tt  >cd</tt> into that directory.
</p><p>
Now use <tt  >vagrant init</tt> to initialize a Vagrantfile there. This is
a standard Vagrant configuration file that is well documented. You
won't need to change any of the configurations, except for line 10:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.vm.box = "base"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you followed the quick-start instructions from
<a href="http://www.vagrantup.com" target="_self">www.vagrantup.com</a>, Vagrant specifies your
default boxes as <span   class="emphasis"><em>base</em></span>. Change this to the name of the box you imported,
precise64: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.vm.box = "precise64"
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I left the .box
extension off.
</p><p>
Now that your Vagrantfile points to the correct box, use <tt  >vagrant
up</tt>
to start your virtual machine.
</p><p>
If you get a warning that your guest additions are out of date, and
it is quite likely that you will if you just installed VirtualBox,
proceed to the next step. If you didn't, you can skip to the section
&ldquo;Add a Salty-Vagrant Vagrantfile&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x2392288"></a>
Updating the Guest Additions</h2></div></div><p>
If you do need to update the guest additions installed on your box,
in this section, I explain how to do it on the Ubuntu-based
box you just downloaded. This will be one of the few times that your
changes will be permanent within a box. And this time, you want them to
be. The guest additions allow your host operating system to interact
with the guest operating system. This includes sharing files and network
resources between them. You store your configuration files on your host
operating system, and then they are copied to the guest operating system
when you start it up each time, so it is important that the shared-folder
functionality works.
</p><p>
After Vagrant finishes booting the guest operating
system, you'll need to connect to this box using
SSH. Use
the Vagrant-supplied command: <tt  >vagrant ssh</tt>.
</p><p>
You then will be logged in to the guest operating system as the
&ldquo;vagrant&rdquo; user.
</p><p>
Updating the guest additions probably is the
trickiest and most-involved task. If you run into any problems, lots of
resources are available on-line. Most distributions mention a number
of solutions in their respective forums, and the VirtualBox
Manual (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html" target="_self">https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html</a>) also has some
detailed information. I'm going to show you how to download and update
the virtualbox guest additions from virtualbox.org, and update them on
the precise64 box that you just downloaded as an example.
</p><p>
First, you need some packages to build and compile the Linux
kernel. Use Ubuntu's package manager, apt, to install them: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install dkms linux-headers-3.2.0-23-generic
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're using a non-Debian machine, search for the
proper names in your particular package manager and use the header
version that matches your particular kernel.
</p><p>
With kernel support now in place, browse to
<a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox" target="_self">download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox</a>
and locate the folder that matches the version of VirtualBox that
you have installed. Generally, you can find what version you have
through the VirtualBox graphical interface or the warning message
generated by Vagrant when you booted your virtual machine. Now, locate
the VBoxGuestAdditions_x.x.x.iso that also matches the version of
Virtualbox that you have installed. Replace the x in the filename
with the specific version for your version of VirtualBox.
</p><p>
You can copy the URL to this file and paste it into the
terminal window of your guest Ubuntu system that you had
previously SSH'd into. Use wget to download the ISO: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/x.x.x/
&#8618;VBoxGuestAdditions_x.x.x.iso
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, replace the x in the filename with the version that matches
your VirtualBox installation.
</p><p>
You now should have an .iso file in your home directory. 
</p><p>
After it's downloaded, mount it so that you can access the files contained
in it by first creating a temporary directory in which to mount this .iso.
Within your home directory, use this command: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p tmp/vbox
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, mount the .iso into that folder: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mount -o loop VBoxGuestAdditions_x.x.x.iso tmp/vbox/
</pre>
</p><p>
Within the .iso, you'll find a VBoxLinuxAdditions.run script. Copy
this to your home directory: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp VBoxLinuxAdditions.run ~
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, make it executable by adding the execute flag: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
</pre>
</p><p>
And finally, run the installation script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
</pre>
</p><p>
If you get a warning about failing to install the window system drivers,
you safely can ignore it. The box you are installing these guest additions
on is a server and doesn't have a window manager installed. You 
also can use the <tt  >--nox11</tt> flag like this when you install the updated
guest additions: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --nox11
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step in this installation is to reboot the machine to ensure
that the guest additions are up to date with: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo reboot
</pre>
</p><p>
After the box restarts, log back in with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant ssh
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can unmount the .iso using <tt  >sudo umount /mnt</tt>, if it isn't
already, and delete the VBoxLinuxAdditions.run and the .iso file to
save space. You also optionally can do some housekeeping by deleting the
.bash_history file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x2393048"></a>
Package the Updated Box</h2></div></div><p>
Now that the guest additions are updated, you should repackage a new box
so the guest additions match each time you turn on this Vagrant box. This
keeps you from needing to update them every time. As long as you don't
change the version of VirtualBox that you are using, you won't need to
update your guest additions. If you do, you'll need to update them again.
</p><p>
Using the <tt  >vagrant package</tt> command, export your new
box.
This will shut down your machine and export a
package.box file in the current directory.
</p><p>
Rename this to something more descriptive, like myprecise64.box.
</p><p>
Now add this new box to Vagrant: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
vagrant box add myprecise64 myprecise64.box
</pre>
</p><p>
The names you give your boxes are arbitrary and entirely up to you. Feel
free to use a description that makes sense to you.
</p><p>
You're done with the original box now, so destroy it with <tt  >vagrant
destroy</tt>. You can remove it entirely from Vagrant with
<tt  >vagrant box remove precise64</tt>.
</p><p>
Add your new myprecise64 box, or whatever you happened to call it,
like you did previously with the base box you downloaded with <tt  >vagrant
box add</tt>.
</p><p>
Make sure to change the name in your Vagrantfile to match the new box,
and test it with <tt  >vagrant up</tt>.
</p><p>
Congratulations! You now have an updated Ubuntu 12.04 VirtualBox suitable
for Salt Stack and Salty-Vagrant automation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x2393620"></a>
Install the Vagrant Salty-Vagrant Gem</h2></div></div><p>
The final piece of software you'll need to install is the Salty-Vagrant
gem. It allows the automatic installation of Salt Stack on your guest
virtual machines and uses Salt Stack to initiate your configuration
and installation of software on them as well.
</p><p>
Back on your host machine (that is, the one that is not your
virtual machine),
use the Vagrant gem command <tt  >vagrant gem install
vagrant-salt</tt> to
install the Salty-Vagrant gem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x23937d8"></a>
Add a Salty-Vagrant-Specific Vagrantfile</h2></div></div><p>
Now you need to add a slightly customized Vagrantfile to configure
some Salt-specific parameters, share your state tree and automatically
install Drupal and the Linux Apache MySQL stack after your VirtualBox
is started. If you added a Vagrantfile previously, you can delete it
now. You're going to add a smaller, more customized one that is available
from the Salty-Vagrant project page at <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant" target="_self">https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant</a>.
You simply can copy and paste this into a new Vagrantfile.
</p><p>
Locate the line <tt  >config.vm.box = "precise64"</tt> and
change <tt  >"precise64"</tt>
to the name of your box. If you've been following along, earlier in the
tutorial, I exported my box as <tt  >"myprecise64"</tt>.
</p><p>
I also like to add guest/host network communications with this line to my
Vagrantfile too: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.vm.network :hostonly, "192.168.33.19"
</pre>
</p><p>
You can
use any available IP address for your internal VirtualBox network. Keep
in mind, this is separate from your own network and is created by
VirtualBox. This allows you to access your Drupal site from your own
operating system's Web browser using the IP address that you specified. You
can choose another IP address if you want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x2393ba0"></a>
Create Your Minion Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
In the same directory as your Vagrantfile, create a salt directory,
srv directory and lamp-drupal directory like this: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p salt/srv/lamp-drupal
</pre>
</p><p>
Create a new minion.conf file in your salt directory that contains
this line: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
file_client: local
</pre>
</p><p>
This instructs Salt not to search for a master server, but instead to use
the local file structure for its configuration information. This is what
you'll see referred to in the Salt Stack documentation as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>masterless</em></span>
configuration.
</p><p>
Locate the line in your Vagrantfile labeled salt.minion_conf and
uncomment it by removing the #. This tells Vagrant where your minion
configuration is located. The path is relative to your Vagrantfile.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x2393eb8"></a>
Get the State Files</h2></div></div><p>
My Drupal SLS
file is available in the salt-states repository (<a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt-states/tree/master/small/lamp-drupal" target="_self">https://github.com/saltstack/salt-states/tree/master/small/lamp-drupal</a>).
You can use this to install
all of the needed packages in Ubuntu for Drupal development. Download that
file now and place it in your /srv/salt/lamp-drupal directory. You'll
also need to create a /srv/salt/top.sls file that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
base:
   '*':
     - lamp-drupal
</pre>
</p><p>
For more details about the top file, see my previously mentioned article
about installing Salt Stack.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x23940c8"></a>
Add the State File to Your Shared Folder</h2></div></div><p>
Within the salt/srv/lamp-drupal directory, copy the init.sls file
from the salt-states repository.
</p><p>
This file instructs Salt that when the machine is booted to install
all of the needed packages for running a Drupal Web server. I've even
included a Drush installation. If you examine the file, you'll find that
it is fairly understandable already. I won't go into much more detail
here, but feel free to take a look at the init.sls file to see what
actually is being installed.
</p><p>
Now edit your Vagrantfile to reflect the location of this state file
by editing the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.vm.share_folder "salt_file_root", "/srv", 
 &#8618;"/path/to/salt_file_root"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea0580.0x22a5f10"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:


<pre     class="programlisting">
config.vm.share_folder "salt_file_root", "/srv/salt", "salt/srv"

Vagrant Up!</h2></div></div><p>
With your minion configuration file in place and your state file ready
to go, this last step will start your machine automatically, install
Salt and install all of the necessary components needed for a Drupal
development server.
</p><p>
Ready? Use <tt  >vagrant up</tt> to start your machine.
</p><p>
You can watch the output and responses as Vagrant, Salty-Vagrant and
Salt Stack automatically download all of the software you specified
and configure it for you.
</p><p>
After the server is started, simply SSH to your virtual server using
<tt  >vagrant ssh</tt> again. You'll find a /var/www folder ready to receive
your Drupal installation.
</p><p>
This SLS file is reusable across multiple environments, and I haven't
configured it to change the permissions of the /var/www folder. You'll
notice this folder is owned by root, just like the Ubuntu package manager
sets it.
</p><p>
The Drush directory located within the vagrant user's home directory is
also owned by root. You'll get an error with Drush if you don't change the
ownership of that folder to the user that is initiating the Drush command.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
By combining four very powerful tools: Vagrant, Salty-Vagrant,
VirtualBox and Salt, you can speed up your Drupal development
considerably. Maintaining small development environments and then
scripting their configuration helps create a win for everyone involved
by adding consistency across all your developers' platforms. Maintaining
small, text-based configuration files can save money on storage
costs too. You and your developers also can save time transferring new
configurations to remote servers.
</p><p>
You can try out new configurations and install additional libraries
if you need or want to, without fear of breaking your local or production
systems.
</p><p>
Each of the tools I have outlined are available for no cost and are open-source projects. You'll find the Salt development community to be one of
the friendliest and most welcoming communities around the Open Source world.
</p><p>
Each project is updated on a regular basis, and it would be a good idea
to review the documentation, as well as changes to the software, if you
encounter any problems.
