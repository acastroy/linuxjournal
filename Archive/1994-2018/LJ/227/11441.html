<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #227, March 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sasha Levin</b></span> wrote a new <span   class="bold"><b>hash table</b></span> implementation for the
kernel. Typically in a big, decentralized software project, developers
aren't necessarily aware of the cool stuff being implemented in the
various nooks and crannies of the code, and there's a tendency for lots
of alternative implementations to crop up everywhere. Hash tables are a
good candidate for that. Sasha's patch was intended to provide a generic
hash table that all kernel developers can use.
</p><p>
Something like this can never find users unless it's really fast. Sasha's
implementation uses a variety of speed-enhancing optimizations, including
doing as much as possible at compile time via macros. But, macros have
their own little syntactic idiosyncrasies that can require a little
extra care during use. <span   class="bold"><b>Mathieu Desnoyers</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Tejun Heo</b></span> pointed out some
improvements and bugs to Sasha's code, addressing some of those problems.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Darrick J. Wong</b></span> took the trouble to create
a nearly three-hour <span   class="bold"><b>gource
animation of Linux kernel development history</b></span>, going all the way back
to the beginning: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOSqctHH9vY" target="_self">www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOSqctHH9vY</a>.
</p><p>
It's lovely to watch. It's also interesting because gource relies on
having a computer-readable log of a project's development history, while
the early history of Linux is more or less a mystery. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>
accepted vast numbers of patches in the 1990s, but he just used the UNIX
diff and patch commands to apply them. The only real records of the
patches were e-mail logs and Usenet logs, but these don't give clear
indications of which patches actually were accepted into the kernel,
and when. It was only with the arrival of <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span>, and later of <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span>,
that a detailed record of Linux's history began to be compiled.
</p><p>
There have been some efforts to re-create some of that early history into
its own git tree, but this is nowhere near as detailed as the kind of
historical records being created these days. The beginning of Darrick's
video, therefore, just shows Linus doing everything for a while and then
being joined by other developers, presumably once the historical record
became more accurate.
</p><p>
After six and a half years of maintaining the <span   class="bold"><b>KVM</b></span> code (the Kernel Virtual
Machine), <span   class="bold"><b>Avi Kivity</b></span> has stepped down. His
co-maintainer <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo Tosatti</b></span>,
formerly also the Linux 2.4 maintainer, was left briefly as the sole
KVM maintainer, until <span   class="bold"><b>Gleb Natapov</b></span> came in to replace Avi.
</p><p>
Everyone should use KVM. It's an easy, secure way to boot up a new
computer without having to go buy one. You can play around with the /etc
directory and other strange internals in ways you might have been afraid
to before. You can try out different Linux distributions, or maybe create your
own, and you also can experiment with creating clusters of many interoperating systems. If
anything goes wrong, just turn off the VM and start fresh. It's very cool.

Most people are familiar with Instapaper and Read It Later. Those types
of services are great for tagging Web articles for later reading, and
in the case of Read It Later (now called &ldquo;Pocket&rdquo;), they do a wonderful job
of copying articles off-line for reading when the Internet isn't available.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11441androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11441androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Using Pocket's Chrome extension, as I browse the Web during the day and
find articles I'd like to read later, I add them to my Pocket queue with
a single click. This works perfectly for me, because although I find
lots of things to read during the work day, I don't have time to read
them. Now, I simply can open the Pocket app on my Nexus 7 and catch up
on my reading as if it were an e-book. As you can see, articles are formatted for
easy reading, and because they sync off-line, reading doesn't require Internet access.
</p><p>
Pocket is a great system, a really nice Android app and provides an effective way
of staying out of trouble at work! Check it out at the Google Play store,
or visit the Web site: <a href="http://getpocket.com" target="_self">getpocket.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Crashplan, the Only Reason I Install Java</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #227, March 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'm the sort of person who doesn't like to install Java. I actually don't
like to install Flash either, but it's still tough to survive browsing
the Internet without Flash installed. There is one program that makes
me break my own rules, however, and that's Crashplan.
</p><p>
For years, I've been singing the praises of BackupPC, and for servers,
I still think it's the best thing going. The problem with BackupPC,
however, is in order for it to work reliably, your workstations need to
be on all the time. This is especially difficult with laptops.
</p><p>
Crashplan is an incredibly powerful backup utility that allows local
or offsite backup, and the company offers cloud-based storage for
reasonable rates. Normally, I wouldn't be so excited by a paid service and
a non-open-source software package, even if it does offer a Linux-native
client. The folks at Code 42, however, have given away the ability to
swap storage with friends as an alternative to their paid-cloud-based
service. If you have a computer at work, and a computer at home, you
can back them up over the Internet to each other completely free!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11441crashf1.large.jpg"><img src="11441crashf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
As I already mentioned, I normally don't like Java-based programs like Crashplan, but its
functionality is so great, I don't mind breaking my own rules. More than
that, I give a lot of credit to Code 42 for not only making a native Linux
client, but also for giving away incredible functionality for free. If
you're not backing up your data, be sure to consider Crashplan at <a href="http://www.crashplan.com" target="_self">www.crashplan.com</a>.
Its price, feature set and generous non-paid features make it this
month's Editors' Choice!

<h2 class="title">The State of Drupal</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Katherine Druckman</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #227, March 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We asked some Drupal community members and leaders from all over the
world about the current state of Drupal and what they are most looking
forward to in Drupal 8. We got a variety of opinions from everyone from
core developers to end users. Here's what they had to say.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ryan Szrama:</b></span>
</p><p>
The current state of Drupal is frenzied. Everyone has a lot of irons in
the fire (as always), and core devs are working madly to get awesome new
features into Drupal 8. I think everyone feels not just the challenge
but the opportunity to make Drupal better, the ecosystem larger and
their businesses more successful.
</p><p>
I'm most excited to have fago's Entity API updated and included in
Drupal core. A robust entity system will make building and maintaining
contributed modules like Drupal Commerce much easier than it's been on
Drupal 7, and we have both the will and code in place now to make this
shine in Drupal 8. Great work all around.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pol Dell'Aiera:</b></span>
</p><p>
Drupal 8 will be the bomb.&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bert Boerland:</b></span>
</p><p>
Web services/WSCCI is <span   class="emphasis"><em>by</em></span> far the best thing happening to Drupal and even
the Web. Web services first!&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry Garfield:</b></span>
</p><p>
Current state: the sands are still very shifty. Drupal 8 still has
a strong potential to be revolutionary and kick so much ass it's
not even funny. The trick is if we can close the deal and not leave
ourselves in a fugly transitional state. That is still a real risk that
keeps me up at night.
</p><p>
Most excited about? There's too much to limit myself. Mostly
I think the formalization of APIs that's happening in many places.
The detangling of hook_menu, EntityNG, the conversion of more and more
systems to cleanly injected (and therefore swappable) systems, etc.
The architectural quality of Drupal 8 is steadily increasing, and once
we wrap our heads around that transition it should be so much more
powerful.&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p>
Look at the distinction between a Content Management System, a Content
Management Framework
and a Web Publishing Tool. Really, really think about it. Then listen to
Karen McGrane talk.
</p><p>
Drupal is so close to something so awesome and I don't think we even
realize it. Stay tuned.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Diana Montalion Dupuis:</b></span>
</p><p>
In general, I am concerned about the schism between the needs/desires of
the development 
community and the needs/desires of people who pay us to solve their
business problems with 
Drupal. I'm excited about many aspects, and as always, beyond grateful to
the dedicated 
geniuses of the community. I also fear that we are doing something (from
the &ldquo;What problem 
do I solve?&rdquo; perspective) different enough from previous versions/visions
that we are taking 
a sharp left turn and actually making something else.
</p><p>
I feel the enthusiasm, Larry's especially. I agree that transition
management is a make 
or break challenge. A steady stream of information that connects our
current marketshares' 
investment in Drupal, and the Drupal shops' investment in team skills, with
the changes 
coming will ease that transition. &ldquo;Drupal will now be widely applicable to
XYZ and thus, 
extend our Web presence into ABC functional areas. So, train your
team!&rdquo; (In
layman's terms.)
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Karoly Negyesi:</b></span>
</p><p>
Disclaimer: I am paid to work on some aspects of Drupal 8 core. Regardless,
this my opinion. 
</p><p>
Current state: the core developers are often screaming. Sometimes from
joy, sometimes 
from frustration.
</p><p>
The new APIs are superbly powerful. At the same time, it'll take some effort
to learn them. 
Parallel to this, there are concerns about the developer experience, but
they were raised 
before the code freeze even&mdash;this is good. Previously, similar concerns
only occurred much 
later in the cycle, and so they couldn't be addressed. No matter how much
will we enhance 
the DX of the new APIs, the &ldquo;surface&rdquo; between the old and new APIs will be
rough. See Larry's 
worries above about a transitional state. I consider that inevitable&mdash;just
the degree is the 
question.
</p><p>
I love what is happening to the UI. However, I always did. I am just a PHP
guy.&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Jason Smith:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm very interested in seeing where the services/WSCCI and configuration
management stuff goes. 
Those are killer features.
</p><p>
I'm a little concerned about the barrier to entry being raised high enough due
to architecture 
to discourage new folks. Drupal's pulling toward enterprise, which is a
good thing. But, 
my concern is that it may neglect that roadmap to mastery that makes Drupal
a fantastic 
platform for open-source devs. &iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Barrett Smith:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm most excited for the configuration management changes slated for D8.
Improving the way 
settings are managed will go a long way toward securing Drupal's place in
enterprise-class, 
multi-tier environments.&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bronius Motekaitis:</b></span>
</p><p>
I love that the Drupal community has grown so large, that Drupal-powered
projects keep increasing in size and complexity, and that core and the
community are working diligently to keep up. I also like that user
experience and accessibility continue to receive a lot of attention. While
this is very exciting, it is disconcerting, because sweeping changes
necessitate climbing up that steep, personal learning curve. By Drupal 8,
I believe we in the community will have gotten much better about
documenting core and contrib, migrations and upgrades, and build recipes.
</p><p>
As code developers and application builders already marinated in Drupal, we
love the increases in power and flexibility, but it is important to retain
the community of &ldquo;simple, one-off builders&rdquo; and continue to pique the interest
of prospects: spending time on documentation, UX/design and appearance are
all important in these regards.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
David Stagg:</b></span>
</p><p>
The biggest issue with Drupal 7 (and as a consequence, Drupal 8) is that
it's coming too 
quickly. While the core is being developed at such a rapid pace (that's
good!), a lot of 
modules and other libraries that worked exceptionally well in Drupal 6
aren't being ported 
over quickly enough to Drupal 7 or 8 (that's bad!).
</p><p>
Events are a perfect example. Drupal 6 has a robust set of modules and
features that allows 
us to make an intensive event-based site; in Drupal 7, almost none of these
are available. 
For those of us intently focused on the front end without the capabilities
to create the 
modules ourselves, this can be tough. The best part of open source is
the community, but 
when the development moves too fast, the dust that settles oftentimes
forfeits a complete 
package. And after all, Drupal isn't complete without the community.&iuml;&raquo;&iquest;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Donna Benjamin:</b></span>
</p><p>
More than one core developer has admitted they've not actually built sites
with D7. Our 
commitment to the future means we abandon the past, and sometimes it seems
the upgrade path 
is an afterthought.
</p><p>
But I'm optimistic about the future&mdash;I think D8 has extraordinary
potential. The work 
that's been done on HTML5, Multilingual, Mobile, Config Management, Web
Services and Authoring 
Experience is really quite phenomenal. It will be a game-changer.
</p><p>
I just hope it's still the kind of system that provides the kinds of
solutions my clients 
and communities require. But I can't deny I am worried its enterprise
target puts it out 
of reach for small sites for small orgs with small budgets, and volunteer
teams. Many people 
learn Drupal in those environments. At the moment, we don't have an
alternative formal 
training and certification pathway to replace that pipeline.
</p><p>
As for the community itself, keep an eye on AsiaPac: India, China, South
East Asia and 
Australasia. We're just not on the radar for most EuroMericans. &iuml;&raquo;&iquest;

For some reason, single-site Web applications like the kind created with
Prism seem to have fallen out of style. I've always been particularly
fond of Chrome-based applications, and yet, there doesn't seem to be
a way to create a single-site Web application properly on OS X using
Chrome. Thankfully, even with modern releases of Chrome, it's 
certainly possible and still very useful.
</p><p>
Two different scripts are available and freely downloadable for
creating single-site Chrome apps on OS X. The first is an AppleScript file
created by Mait Vilbiks, available at <a href="http://snar.co/chromeapp1" target="_self">snar.co/chromeapp1</a>. The
other is a Bash script that does the same identical thing, but it works
on the command line. It's available at <a href="http://snar.co/chromeapp2" target="_self">snar.co/chromeapp2</a>.
(Note: both files are public domain and can be modified if desired.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11441fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The AppleScript version walks you through the process.
</p></div></div><p>
If you have ever wished Google Calendar was a standalone application,
or if you just want to have dock icons for your various Web activities,
either of these scripts work wonders. Even better, if you want to delete
the application, simply drag it to the trash. Chrome apps work great as
standalone applications in OS X, and now you can try them yourself!

We polled our on-line readers about their Web development preferences
and got some surprising and not-so-surprising results. Perhaps the
biggest surprise is that Drupal just slightly edged out WordPress.
WordPress traditionally has been the most popular of the two among our
readers, with Joomla a close third to Drupal's second place. This time,
Drupal beat out WordPress by a hair with Joomla a distant third.
Chrome's popularity over Firefox was a surprise, but as someone who
tests in everything but prefers Chrome, I can't say I'm shocked. Our
readers' love of vim and JQuery is not a surprise, nor is the
popularity of Python and PHP.

A lot of the software packages I've covered in recent articles have
been focused strictly on doing computations on your machine, separate
from the real world. So in this article, I explore how to use your computer to
design something you can build and use in the real world: your
own model rocket. Let's take a look at the OpenRocket utility
and see how it can help you design your own rockets. OpenRocket even can run
simulations on your designs to show how they should behave in flight. 
</p><p>
Most
distributions should include a package for OpenRocket. For example, in
Ubuntu, you would install it with <tt  >apt-get install
openrocket</tt>. It is
actually a Java program, so you always can download the jar file directly
from the Web site (<a href="http://openrocket.sourceforge.net" target="_self">openrocket.sourceforge.net</a>). To run it,
you need to have a reasonably up-to-date Java VM installed as well.
</p><p>
When you first start it up, you are presented with an empty screen, ready to
begin designing your first rocket. A project window pops up, allowing you
to enter details like the design name, your name and design notes. You can
build your rocket from a series of components. You probably will want
to start with the nose cone by clicking on it from the &ldquo;Add new
component&rdquo;
window. It then will appear in the bottom section, beginning your
design. 
</p><p>
You will notice that OpenRocket already begins to make calculations
based on your design. You will see a small blue circle that denotes the
center of gravity of your rocket. The center of gravity is the point
through which all of the mass acts. There also is a small red dot that
marks the center of pressure. This is the point through which all of the
atmospheric forces act. OpenRocket calculates these values as you make
changes to your design. 
</p><p>
You can edit almost all of the parameters for each component.
There are two ways to edit these component parameters. You
can double-click on the component of interest in the design window to
access the edit window. There also is a list of the component layers in the
top half. You can highlight the component of interest here and then click
on the Edit button. 
</p><p>
What you can change will depend on which component
you are trying to edit. The first component to design probably is the nose
cone. You can select what kind of profile your nose cone should have,
such as conical or ellipsoid. You can set the length and base diameter,
as well as the wall thickness. But, OpenRocket goes even further. You
can select the kind of material from which your nose cone should be made. The
different types of materials have different densities, which changes the
weight of your component. 
</p><p>
Several different material presets are available,
but you also can go ahead and define your own custom material type. This
custom material either can be used just for one design, or you can add it
permanently to your materials database if it is something you will
be using over and over again. You even can set the type of finish
your rocket will have. This finish can be different for each component,
or you can apply a common finish to your entire rocket.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11441rocketf1.large.jpg"><img src="11441rocketf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
When first starting OpenRocket, you get a new project dialog
where you can enter details of your rocket.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11441rocketf2.large.jpg"><img src="11441rocketf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
You can edit many details of the different components by double-clicking
the component of interest.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11441rocketf3.large.jpg"><img src="11441rocketf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The rocket engine database has lots of information on many different
brands.
</p></div></div><p>
The next part of your rocket is the actual body tube. If your rocket
is going to have a single stage, you will need only a single body
tube. For multiple stages, you will need a separate body tube for
each stage. Opening the edit window for the body tube allows you to
change the tube length, diameter and wall thickness. You also can
change the material from which the body tube is made. 
</p><p>
Because body
tubes usually contain a rocket motor, you can set the motor that
you want to use as well. To do so, open the edit window and
click on the motor tab. You can click the Select Motor button and
choose from a large selection of commercially available motors. This list
of motors includes technical information, such as the thrust curve and
the run times, as well as physical characteristics like the length,
diameter and weight. 
</p><p>
As with the other sections of the application, you
can define your own custom entries. This means even full-on DIY
model-rocket enthusiasts who build their own motors can use OpenRocket
to design their rockets. 
</p><p>
The component list includes other items like
parachutes, shock cords, connectors and blocks, so you can
design your rocket as a complete model. 
</p><p>
The final stage is to add tail
fins to your rocket. As with the other components, there are well designed
presets available that will satisfy most design needs. You can edit some
parameters to customize the fins to some degree. If that's not enough,
there is a freehand option where you can design your fins from scratch.
</p><p>
OpenRocket is not only a design program. You also can take your model
rocket and run an analysis on it to see how it will behave in flight. The
analysis section looks at individual components and shows how they
affect the stability, drag and roll characteristics of your rocket. You
can set parameters like wind direction, angle of attack and speed, and
calculate how it will behave in flight. 
This is great functionality, but
OpenRocket goes even further. It can take your original design and try to
optimize it for the best flight characteristics. You can optimize based
on altitude, velocity or some other combination of characteristics. 
</p><p>
Once
you have a final design, you can run it through simulations. The simulator
can apply different conditions on your rocket, like applying crosswinds
or taking Coriolis effects into account, and it shows how your model rocket
should behave. OpenRocket uses JFreeChart to plot your rocket's behavior
based on the simulation results. 
</p><p>
You even can add your own code to the
simulation to add extra effects. One way to do this is using Python and
jPype to use Python code in the simulations. Additionally, you have the ability
to write and use your own expressions in the simulator. This allows
you to customize the simulator to a great degree without having to add
external code. Then, you can see the limits of what your model should be
able to handle and how high it will go under different conditions. This
is really great in helping you decide when the weather is going to be
too rough for your design.

</p></div></div><p>
I have covered only the features available in the most minimal way. If you are
into building and flying model rockets, your time definitely will be well
spent poking around all of OpenRocket's available features.
The Rocketry Forum hosts a forum where you can ask
for further help. And once you have gained some experience, you can
give back by helping other new rocket enthusiasts. Go ahead and design
your fleet, and get yourself out into the wild frontier of space!

<h2 class="title">Shell Game</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #227, March 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many of the cool things in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> require the use of the command
line. For us Linux users, that's generally not a big deal, because we
have a terminal window readily available. Some of the time, however,
it's helpful to have a shell account on an Internet host somewhere.
</p><p>
If your Web-hosting service provides shell access, you might be able
to use it for rudimentary command-line procedures. (In fact, Dreamhost
in particular allows SSH tunneling through its servers for clients.)
If you want to use particular programs like screen or irssi though, it will
require something a little more robust.
</p><p>
Some free shell services are available (like
<a href="http://www.geekshells.org" target="_self">www.geekshells.org</a>), but they often are very restrictive,
and it can
be challenging to get an account with them. Thankfully, if you don't mind
spending a few dollars a month, shell accounts are fairly common and
relatively inexpensive. The Eggdrop folks have compiled a great list
here: <a href="http://www.egghelp.org/shells.htm" target="_self">www.egghelp.org/shells.htm</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11441shellf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sometimes, you just need a shell.
</p></div></div><p>
Of course, if you want to have a full-blown server on the Internet,
it's hard to beat a colocated Raspberry Pi server like the one Kyle
Rankin talked about last month. However you manage it, it's hard to be
a geek without access to a terminal!
