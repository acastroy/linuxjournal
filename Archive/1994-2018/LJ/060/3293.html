    A look at current state-of-the-art network hardware and
    protocols with a solution for the slow network problem.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1840818"></a></h2></div></div><p>We have been using Linux to develop a new
high-speed network we call FlowNet. This project has been a
&ldquo;virtual garage&rdquo; operation, involving only two people, one in
California and the other (at various times) in Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania and Indiana. We transferred designs and code over the
Internet and hardware via Federal Express. The result is a unique
network that combines the best features of today's current
standards into a single design. FlowNet is currently the world's
fastest computer network capable of operating over 100 meters of
standard category-5 copper cable. The software for FlowNet was
developed and currently runs exclusively under Linux.
</p><p>To appreciate how FlowNet works, it is important to
understand some details about network hardware, so we will start
with a brief tutorial on the current network state of the
art.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1840978"></a>Network Background</h2></div></div><p>The dominant hardware standard for local area networks today
is Ethernet, which comes in dozens of variants. The only feature
common to all forms of Ethernet is its frame format; that is, the
format of the data handled directly by the Ethernet hardware. An
Ethernet frame is a variable-size frame ranging from 64 to 1514
bytes, with a 14-byte header. The header contains only three
fields: the address of the sender of the frame, the address of the
receiver and the frame type.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1840a80"></a>Shared-Media Ethernet</h2></div></div><p>Ethernet design has two major variations called shared-media
and switched. In shared-media Ethernet, all the network nodes are
connected to a single piece of wire, so only one node can transmit
data at any one time. Ethernet uses a protocol called
carrier-sense-multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) to
choose which node is allowed to transmit at any given time. CSMA/CD
is a non-deterministic protocol and does not guarantee fair access.
In fact, in a heavily congested network, CSMA/CD tends to favor a
single node to the exclusion of others, a phenomenon known as the
capture effect. Being on the wrong end of the capture effect is one
way a network connection can be lost for a long period of
time.</p><p>The CSMA/CD protocol does not allow a node to start
transmitting while the wire is being used by another node (that is
the carrier-sense part). However, it is possible for two nodes to
start transmitting at almost the same time. The result is that the
two transmissions interfere with each other and neither
transmission can be properly received. The period during which a
collision can occur is the time from when a node starts to transmit
to when the signal actually arrives at all other nodes on the wire.
This time depends on the physical distance between the furthest
nodes on the wire. If this distance is too long, a node might
finish transmitting a frame before it arrives at all nodes on the
wire. This would make it possible for a collision to occur that the
transmitting node would not detect. In order to prevent this from
happening, the physical span of a shared-media Ethernet network is
limited. This distance is known as the collision diameter; it is a
function of the time necessary to transmit the shortest possible
Ethernet frame (64 bytes). The collision diameter of a traditional
Ethernet operating at 10Mbps is about two kilometers, which is
plenty for most local area networks. However, the collision
diameter shrinks at faster data rates, since the time it takes to
transmit a frame is less. The collision diameter for Fast Ethernet,
which operates at 100Mbps, is 200 meters&mdash;a limit that can be
constraining in a large building. (The collision diameter for
Gigabit Ethernet would be 20 meters, but because this distance is
so ridiculously short, Gigabit Ethernet does not use
CSMA/CD.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1840be0"></a>Switched Ethernet</h2></div></div><p>The way to get around the limitations of shared-media
Ethernet is to use a device called a switch. A switch has a number
of connections or ports, each of which can receive a frame
simultaneously with the others. Thus, in a switched network,
multiple nodes can transmit at the same time. In a purely switched
network, every node has its own switch port and there can be no
collisions. However, there can still be resource contention because
it is now possible for two nodes to simultaneously transmit frames
destined for a single node, which still can receive only one frame
at a time. The switch must therefore decide which frame to deliver
first and what to do with the other frame while waiting. Switches
typically include some buffering so that contention of this sort
does not necessarily result in lost data, but under heavy use, all
switched networks will eventually be forced to discard some
frames.</p><p>How does the switch decide which frames to drop? Most
switches simply operate on a first-in/first-out basis. That is,
when they are forced to drop frames, they drop the most recently
received ones. Not much in the way of alternatives is offered
because no information is in the Ethernet header to indicate which
frames are less important and should be dropped first. As a result,
when most switches become congested, they drop frames essentially
at random.</p><p>That behavior creates a serious problem. The response of most
network protocols, including TCP/IP, to dropped frames is to
retransmit the dropped frames. Thus, network congestion leads to
randomly dropped frames, which leads to retransmission, which leads
to more network congestion, which leads to more randomly dropped
frames. When this happens, many networks, in particular the
Internet, will often come to a screeching halt.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1840d98"></a>Quality of Service</h2></div></div><p>The only way to solve this problem is to add information to
the frame to give switches guidance on how to handle individual
frames. For example, if a frame is tagged as part of an e-mail
message, a switch would know that it is perfectly acceptable to
delay this frame, but also that it should probably not be
discarded. On the other hand, if this frame is part of a video
stream, then a switch would know that if this frame cannot be
transmitted right away, it should be discarded, resulting in a
small glitch in the video. Information on how a frame should be
handled in a congested network is known as quality-of-service
information or QoS.</p><p>QoS information can be provided in three ways. The first is
to completely redesign the network from the ground up. This is the
approach used by the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network
design. ATM is a circuit-switched rather than a packet-switched
network. In a packet-switched network like Ethernet, each data
frame contains its destination address in its header. The process
of delivering a frame to its destination is similar to that of
delivering a letter. At every switch, the destination address is
looked up in a table to see where it should go next.
Circuit-switched networks like ATM put the destination address into
only one frame, called a flow-setup frame or flow-setup cell. The
flow-setup cell establishes a route through the network, much like
placing a phone call does. Subsequent frames are automatically
routed through this pre-established connection. The flow-setup
process allows the ATM network to allocate network resources ahead
of time in order to provide quality-of-service guarantees.</p><p>ATM's circuit-switched design is fundamentally incompatible
with Ethernet's packet-switched design. ATM also differs from
Ethernet in the size of its frames. Where Ethernet uses
variable-size frames, ATM uses fixed-size 53-byte frames or cells,
of which five bytes are header and 48 bytes per frame are payload
data. This leads to a serious problem: the rate at which cells must
be routed is so fast that it can be done only with custom hardware,
which makes ATM very expensive.</p><p>The second way to provide QoS information is to put it in the
data portion of an Ethernet frame. This is the approach being taken
by the Ethernet community, through protocols such as RSVP. The
advantage to this approach is that it is backwards compatible with
existing hardware, which is important because an enormous Ethernet
infrastructure is already installed. ATM can be made to
interoperate with Ethernet through a technology called LAN
emulation (LANE), but it is both difficult and inefficient.</p><p>The problem with implementing QoS using the existing Ethernet
frame format is that most existing hardware will not recognize the
new protocols associated with QoS. This can undermine the QoS
mechanisms by injecting frames into the network which are not
properly tagged or by not handling tagged frames properly. Thus,
while this approach is backwards compatible with existing hardware,
it probably won't be reliable unless most of the existing
infrastructure is replaced.</p><p>The third approach is to add QoS information to the Ethernet
header. This is a non-backwards-compatible change, but not as
radical a redesign as ATM, and it can be done in a way that makes
it easy to interoperate the new network with existing hardware.
This is the approach we have taken in the design of FlowNet.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3293f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The FlowNet prototype is built entirely from
off-the-shelf components and fits in a standard PCI slot just like
an Ethernet card. In production, this board could be reduced to
just two or three chips.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1841210"></a>The FlowNet Architecture</h2></div></div><p>Like ATM, FlowNet is a switched network based on fixed-size
cells. Unlike ATM, FlowNet cells are large&mdash;800 bytes instead of
53. This allows room for a 14-byte Ethernet header plus an
additional QoS extension. The QoS extension header is 18 bytes,
making the full FlowNet header 32 bytes long. The remaining 768
bytes (=256+512) are data payload.</p><p>FlowNet interoperates with Ethernet through a simple bridge
device. To convert a FlowNet cell into an Ethernet frame, the
bridge simply strips off the QoS extension. To go the other way, it
generates a QoS extension with default or user-configured values.
For example, the bridge could be programmed to give frames from
certain workstations high priority, while frames from other
workstations receive low priority.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3293f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1841528"></a>Distributed Switching</h2></div></div><p>The FlowNet architecture is innovative in ways that go beyond
the structure of the frame. A FlowNet network interface card (NIC)
is quite simple, consisting of a transmitter, receiver, some memory
and a microprocessor. NICs are logically daisy-chained together to
form a loop. Physically, FlowNet uses a star topology with a hub,
just like Ethernet. When a node sends a cell, the cell is received
and retransmitted by every node between the transmitter and the
receiver, an arrangement known as a store-and-forward loop. To
reduce latency, FlowNet uses a technique called cut-through
routing, which allows a cell to be retransmitted as soon as the
header is received.</p><p>The resulting network is a switched network, with a unique
feature: it does not require a switch. Instead, each NIC acts like
a little two-port switch, with one port on the network and another
at the host interface. Switching capability is distributed among
all the nodes on the loop. Cell routing decisions are made in
software by the on-board microprocessor, which provides
sophisticated quality of service without expensive custom
hardware.</p><p>Making cell-switching decisions in software is possible due
to FlowNet's large cell size. Cell-switching decisions are made on
a per-cell basis. Larger cells mean fewer cells for a given data
rate, which means fewer cell-switching decisions to be made.
Current FlowNet prototypes can switch data at 250Mbps full-duplex
(for a total data rate of 500Mbps) using an Intel i960
microprocessor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x18416e0"></a>Development</h2></div></div><p>FlowNet is a state-of-the-art network. Beside being the
fastest network available over 100-meter runs copper cable, it is
the only network available that provides quality of service and is
efficiently interoperable with Ethernet. FlowNet was developed on a
shoestring budget (about $20,000 US for a dozen prototypes) by the
authors working alone in their spare time.</p><p>Open-source software, including Linux and Intel's gnu960
development tools, was instrumental in allowing this to happen.
Linux was used to develop both the on-board firmware and the device
drivers for FlowNet. Several Linux features were crucial for
allowing us to meet our objectives. The first was the availability
of model code for device drivers. Because FlowNet's interface is so
similar to Ethernet, we were able to use Donald Becker's Tulip
driver as a model and adapt it for FlowNet rather than starting
from scratch.</p><p>The second Linux feature that helped immeasurably was kernel
modules. Because device driver code is kernel code, it was not
possible to run it as an application. Without modules, device
drivers have to be tested by compiling them into the kernel and
rebooting. This adds time to the development cycle. With kernel
modules, kernel code can be dynamically linked and unlinked,
reducing the testing cycle to less than a minute. We built a kernel
module for FlowNet that loaded the card's firmware through the PCI
bus during initialization. This made it possible to recompile and
restart all the FlowNet software with a single
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command. As a result, all of
the software for FlowNet was developed in less than three
months.</p><p>The only time rebooting was necessary was when a bug in the
driver code caused a kernel panic. Sometimes this would cause the
machine to crash, but not always. At no time during the development
process did we ever lose any data as the result of a kernel crash,
despite the fact that on occasion we were overwriting critical
kernel data structures with random bits. Linux is astoundingly
robust.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1748580.0x1841948"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>FlowNet would not have come into being without Linux for a
development platform. The hardware costs stretched our meager
budget to the limit. The development tools needed to develop
FlowNet for a commercial OS would have killed the project.</p><p>FlowNet was first conceived in 1993. Although Fast Ethernet
(and soon, Gigabit Ethernet) seem to be taking over the world,
FlowNet is still unique in offering gigabit performance and quality
of service without requiring fiber optic cabling or discarding
Ethernet infrastructure. Linux made it possible to build FlowNet as
a private development&mdash;it almost certainly could not have happened
any other way. FlowNet is not currently in production; contact the
authors for more information (http://www.flownet.com/).</p></div></div>
