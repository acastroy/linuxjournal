        LINUX for Dummies, Quick Reference, 2nd Edition, by Phil Hughes

        Edition</em></span></h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Author: Phil Hughes</p></li><li><p>Publisher: IDG Books Worldwide, Inc.</p></li><li><p>Price: $15.00 US</p></li><li><p>ISBN: 0-7645-0302-2</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Harvey Friedman</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2981f1.jpg"></div><p>I reproduce here the first two paragraphs from the
introduction to this book because I think the author succeeded in
doing exactly what he described:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX for Dummies Quick
Reference</em></span> fills you in on some of the basic capabilities
of the Linux system, along with an assortment of those that aren't
so widely used&mdash;commands and options you would discover only after
years of experience using Linux.
</p><p>Although this book isn't the whole story on Linux, I have
tried to provide you with the most amount of useful information
possible in a compact reference. For instance, descriptions of
Linux commands include examples of their usage to illustrate how
Linux syntax really works.</p></blockquote></div><p>This quick reference is not a quick reference to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux for Dummies</em></span> but to the Linux system, so
it is not organized in the same way. I'll try to summarize what is
in it. There are ten parts, an appendix of on-line resources and a
glossary. Part I, &ldquo;Getting to Know Linux&rdquo;, covers what Linux is,
selecting a Linux flavor, installing Linux, and fixing installation
problems.
</p><p>Part II, &ldquo;Understanding the Shell&rdquo;, covers available
shells, basic directory commands, character quoting, command
history, customizing the environment, directory naming conventions,
directory referencing, files associated with a program, file naming
conventions, path names, shell command elements, shell variables,
special characters and startup files.</p><p>Part III, &ldquo;Common Shell Commands&rdquo;, covers commands for bash
and/or the Korn shell but not csh, tcsh or any other shell.
Luckily, most of the commands described are common to these
shells.</p><p>Part IV, &ldquo;Using X/FVWM&rdquo;, covers an introduction to X, the
FVWM Desktop Anatomy, adding backgrounds, checking out programs
under X, examining pull-down menus, exiting X, modifying window
characteristics, mousing with X, moving around the screen, starting
applications, starting X, switching tasks, using button bars and
using keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>Part V, &ldquo;Text Editors and Working with Text&rdquo;, covers the
editors joe, Pico, Emacs, vi, spell-checking with ispell and
formatting with fmt and groff.</p><p>Part VI, &ldquo;Sending and Receiving E-Mail&rdquo;, covers
understanding the pieces of an e-mail system, using Elm and Pine
(the most popular screen-based e-mail programs), getting your
e-mail remotely with POP and working with metamail files.</p><p>Part VII, &ldquo;Working with the Other Guys&rdquo;, covers working
with MS-DOS files and media and working with Macintosh media,
working with UNIX files and media and converting data using Linux
utilities.</p><p>Part VIII, &ldquo;Networking&rdquo;, covers transferring files over a
network, working interactively on remote machines and checking
network connectivity.</p><p>Part IX, &ldquo;System Administration&rdquo;, covers adding users and
groups, connecting to an ISP with PPP, starting and stopping the
system, kernel modules and performing system maintenance.</p><p>Part X, &ldquo;Using Regular Expressions&rdquo;, covers understanding
simple regular expressions and combining expressions, and looks at
some examples.</p><p>A few awkward explanations I found while reviewing the first
edition were corrected in this second edition, using my suggested
phrasings. I have to admit I missed several other minor problems
which I list below:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>On page 20 in the example, both &ldquo;super&rdquo; and
&ldquo;stewart.txt&rdquo; refer to the same file so should be the
same.</p></li><li><p>On page 66, it would be nice to see an example of
removing strangely named files, as this is tricky if one has not
seen it done.</p></li><li><p>On page 107, &ldquo;:rangess/...&rdquo;; should be replaced
with &ldquo;:ranges/...&rdquo;; meta-notation in an example is
confusing.</p></li><li><p>On page 198, there is a simple typo under LILO;
&ldquo;than&rdquo; should be &ldquo;that&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div><p>Since I didn't notice those when I reviewed the first
edition, there may be more that remain to be fixed.
</p><p>I expected the Quick Reference to be good because I have used
some of the pocket references Phil Hughes wrote for SSC, and I
wasn't disappointed. I let my wife, who uses an SGI machine at
work, look at it and she concluded that this would be a good
reference for UNIX generally, not just for Linux.</p><p>It has been my impression that any of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dummies</em></span> series of books should lead an
uninformed user in a step-by-step didactic fashion, possibly using
some humor to make difficult concepts more accessible. I think this
is one of the better <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dummies</em></span> books, as it is
factually correct and entertaining as well. Of course, those who
grew up using a GUI and don't deal with command-line interfaces may
have to wait for the video.</p></div></div>
