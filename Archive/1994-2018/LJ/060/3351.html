way to add functionality to a web site. When a user's request is
meant for a CGI program, the web server fires up a separate process
and invokes the program. Anything sent to the STDOUT file
descriptor is sent to the user's browser, and anything sent to
STDERR is filed in the web server's error log.
</p><p>While CGI has been a useful standard for web programming, it
leaves much to be desired. In particular, the fact that each
invocation of a CGI program requires its own process turns out to
be a large performance bottleneck. It also means that if you use a
language like Perl where the code is compiled upon invocation, your
code will be compiled each time it is invoked.</p><p>One way to avoid this sort of problem is by writing your own
web server software. Such a project is a significant undertaking,
though. While the first web server I used consisted of 20 lines of
Perl, most servers must now handle a great many standards and error
conditions, in addition to simple requests for documents.</p><p>Apache, a highly configurable open-source HTTP server, makes
it possible to extend its functionality by writing modules. Indeed,
modern versions of Apache depend on modules for most functionality,
not just a few add-ons. When you compile and install Apache for
your computer system, you can choose which modules you wish to
install.</p><p>One of these modules is
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, which places an entire
Perl binary inside your web server. This allows you to modify
Apache's behavior using Perl, rather than C.</p><p>Even if you plan to use approximately the same code with
mod_perl as you would with CGI, it is useful to know that mod_perl
has some built-in smarts that caches compiled Perl code. This gives
an extra speed boost, on top of the efficiency gained by avoiding
the creation of a child process in which to run the CGI
program.</p><p>Over the last year, this column has looked at some of the
most popular ways of using mod_perl, namely the Apache::Registry
and HTML::Embperl modules. The former allows you to run almost all
CGI programs untouched, while taking advantage of the various speed
advantages built into mod_perl. HTML::Embperl is a template system
that allows us to combine HTML and Perl in a single file.</p><p>Both Apache::Registry and HTML::Embperl offer a great deal of
power and allow programmers to take advantage of some of mod_perl's
power and speed. However, using these modules prevents us from
having direct access to Apache's guts, turning it into a program
that can handle our specific needs better than the generic Apache
server.</p><p>This month, we will look at how to write modules for
mod_perl. As you will see, writing such modules is more complicated
than writing CGI programs. However, it is not significantly more
complicated and can give you tremendous flexibility and
power.</p><p>Keep in mind that while CGI programs can be used, often
without modification, on a variety of web servers, mod_perl works
only with the Apache server. This means that modules written for
mod_perl will work on other Apache servers, which constitute more
than half of the web servers in the world, but not on other types
of servers, be they free or proprietary.</p><p>If portability across different servers is a major goal in
your organization, think twice before using mod_perl. But if you
expect to use Apache for the foreseeable future, I strongly suggest
looking into mod_perl. Your programs will run faster and more
efficiently, and you will be able to create applications that would
be difficult or impossible with CGI alone.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539978"></a>Perl*Handlers</h2></div></div><p>CGI programmers have a limited view of HTTP, the hypertext
transfer protocol used for nearly all web communication. Normally,
a server receiving a request from an HTTP client (most often a web
browser) translates the incoming URL into the local file system,
checks to see if the file exists and returns a response code along
with the file's contents or an error message, as appropriate. CGI
programs are invoked only halfway through this process, after the
translation has taken place, the file has been found and a new
process fired off.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, by contrast,
allows you to examine and modify each part of the HTTP transaction,
beginning with the client's initial contact through the logging of
the transaction on the server's file system. Each HTTP server
divides an HTTP transaction into a series of stages; Apache has
more than a dozen such stages.</p><p>Each stage is known as a &ldquo;handler&rdquo; and is given the
opportunity to act on the current stage of the HTTP transaction.
For example, the TransHandler translates URLs into files on the
file system, a LogHandler takes care of logging events to the
access and error logs, and a PerlTypeHandler checks and returns the
MIME type associated with each document. Additional handlers are
called when important events, such as startup, shutdown and restart
occur.</p><p>Each of these Apache handlers has a mod_perl counterpart,
known by the collective name of &ldquo;Perl*Handlers&rdquo;. As you can guess
from this nickname, each Perl*Handler begins with the word &ldquo;Perl&rdquo;
and ends with the word &ldquo;Handler&rdquo;.</p><p>A generic Perl*Handler, known simply as PerlHandler, is also
available and is quite similar to CGI programs. If you want to
receive a request, perform some calculations and return a result,
use PerlHandler. Indeed, most applications that are visible to the
end user can be done with PerlHandler. The other Perl*Handlers are
more appropriate for changing Apache's behavior from a Perl module,
such as when you want to add a new type of access log, alter the
authorization mechanism, or add some code at startup or
shutdown.</p><p>I realize the distinction between Perl*Handlers (meaning all
of the possible handlers available to Perl programmers) and
PerlHandlers (meaning modules that take advantage of Apache's
generic &ldquo;handler&rdquo;) can be confusing. Truth be told, confusing the
two isn't that big a deal, since the majority of programs are
written for PerlHandler and not for any of the other
Perl*Handlers.</p><p>As I mentioned above, mod_perl caches Perl code, compiles it
once, then runs that compiled code during subsequent invocations.
This means that, in contrast to CGI programs, changes made in our
program will not be reflected immediately on the server. Rather, we
must tell Apache to reload our program in some way. The easiest way
to do this is to send a HUP signal
(<b  >killall&nbsp;-1&nbsp;-v&nbsp;httpd</b> on my Linux
box), but there are other ways as well. Another method is to use
the <b  >Apache::StatINC</b> module, which keeps track of
modules' modification dates, loading new versions as
necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539d98"></a>Writing a Simple PerlHandler</h2></div></div><p>As we know, CGI programs are stand-alone programs that are
invoked from an outside process, namely the web server. PerlHandler
modules are actually subroutines within the Apache process; Apache
invokes our subroutine when a certain set of conditions is
fulfilled.</p><p>Writing a PerlHandler module is not much different from
writing any Perl module. (If you are unfamiliar with writing Perl
modules, see the &ldquo;perlmod&rdquo; man pages, or any of the books
available on the subject.) We create a module with a single
subroutine defined, called &ldquo;handler&rdquo;, shown in Listing 1. This
code has several elements common to many PerlHandler
modules.</p><p><a href="3351l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539fa8"></a>Listing 1. PerlHandler Module</h2></div></div><p>First of all, the entire module contains a single subroutine,
&ldquo;handler&rdquo;. We can define additional subroutines if we want, but
usually it is easiest to use the established standard and
default.</p><p>Next, notice the handler is invoked with a single argument,
which we call <b  >$r.</b> It is an instance of the
Apache object, which gives us access to the innards of the Apache
web server. <b  >$r</b> is our conduit to the outside
world of the HTTP server and the user's browser. We invoke certain
methods to determine the state of the server and browser and other
methods to send output to the user's browser. Without
<b  >$r</b> we are somewhat lost, so it is natural that
our first action upon entering &ldquo;handler&rdquo; is to retrieve
<b  >$r</b>.</p><p>We also use the <b  >-w</b> and
<b  >use&nbsp;strict</b> programming aides in our
program. While these are normally good ideas for good, clean Perl
programs, they are essential when developing under mod_perl. As we
will see later, mod_perl's caching and persistence means we need to
be extra careful with our use of memory, in order to keep our HTTP
server process as slim as possible.</p><p>Our handler uses only three methods from
<b  >$r:</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>content_type</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>send_http_header</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span>.</p><p>The first method, content_type, allows us to set or retrieve
the &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header that will precede the response. Every
HTTP response must be described with such a header, which tells the
browser whether the response is an HTML-formatted text file, a GIF
image or a <span   class="bold"><b>zip</b></span> file.</p><p>Once we have set the &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header to an
appropriate value, we send all of the headers to the user's browser
with the send_http_header method. Past this point, anything sent to
the user's browser will be considered part of the HTTP response
body, rather than the headers that describe that body.</p><p>The third method, print, is analogous to the built-in
&ldquo;print&rdquo; function. However, it takes into consideration several
factors that &ldquo;print&rdquo; might not, such as timeouts.
<b  >$r-&gt;print</b> takes a list of arguments just as
the &ldquo;print&rdquo; function does. Thus, you can use</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$r-&gt;print("a", "b", "c");
</pre><p>and expect three characters to be sent to the user's browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x253a790"></a>Constants and Return Codes</h2></div></div><p>Once we have finished writing the response, we exit from our
module by returning the OK symbol to the caller. We import OK from
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Constants</b></span>, a module that
provides us with a large number of useful symbols. In order not to
pollute our name space too much, we explicitly request that only
&ldquo;OK&rdquo; be imported with no other symbols.</p><p>If we were writing a more complicated module, we might use
one of the export tags such as <b  >:common</b> and
<b  >:response</b>, which allow us to import a group of
symbols without having to name them explicitly. Thus, we could use
the statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use Apache::Constants qw(:response);
</pre><p>which would import all symbols needed for a response.
</p><p>Most PerlHandler modules will want their &ldquo;handler&rdquo;
subroutines to return one of two symbols: either OK, which
indicates that the handler successfully dealt with the request and
no other PerlHandler needs to do anything, or the DECLINED symbol.
If your module's &ldquo;handler&rdquo; routine returns DECLINED, it means &ldquo;I
was unable to do anything with the input I was given and would be
happy if some other PerlHandler would do something.&rdquo; Often,
returning DECLINED means the default Apache behavior will be
applied; if our PerlHandler were to return DECLINED, Apache would
try to read the file named in the URL and do something with it. By
returning OK, we indicate that our module took care of things, and
Apache can move on to the next PerlHandler.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x253ab00"></a>Configuring Apache</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how easy it is to write a PerlHandler
module, let's look at how to install this module on our web server.
We do this in the configuration file, typically named httpd.conf.
If your copy of Apache uses three .conf files, understand that the
division between them is artificial and based on the server's
history, rather than any real need for three files. Apache
developers recognized this increasingly artificial division and
recently decided that future versions of the server will have a
single file, httpd.conf, rather than three.</p><p>Apache configuration files depend on directives, which are
variable assignments in disguise. That is, the statement</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ServerName lerner.co.il
</pre><p>sets the &ldquo;ServerName&rdquo; variable to the value
&ldquo;lerner.co.il&rdquo;.
</p><p>If you want a directive to affect a subset of the files or
directories on the server, you can use a &ldquo;section&rdquo;. For instance,
if we say:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin&gt;
AllowOverride None
Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>then the <b  >AllowOverride</b> and
<b  >Options</b> directives apply only to the directory
/usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin. In this way, we can apply
different directives to different files.
</p><p>&ldquo;Directory&rdquo; sections allow us to modify the behavior of
particular files and directories. We can also use &ldquo;Location&rdquo;
sections to modify the behavior of URLs not connected to
directories. Location sections work in the same way as Directory
sections, except that Location takes its argument relative to URLs,
while Directory takes its argument relative to the server's file
system.</p><p>For example, we could rewrite the above Directory section as
the following Location section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /cgi-bin&gt;
AllowOverride None
Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>Of course, this assumes that URLs beginning with /cgi-bin
point to /usr/local/apache/share/cgi-bin on the server file system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2933278"></a>Installing a PerlHandler Module</h2></div></div><p>All this background is necessary to understand how we will
install our PerlHandler module. After all, our PerlHandler will
influence the way in which one or more URLs will be affected. If we
(unwisely) want our PerlHandler module to affect all the files in
/cgi-bin, then we use</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /cgi-bin&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::TestModule
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>This tells Apache we will be handling all URLs under /cgi-bin
with a Perl handler. We then tell Apache which PerlHandler to use,
naming <span   class="bold"><b>Apache::TestModule</b></span>. If we
did not install Apache::TestModule in the appropriate place on the
server file system and if the package was not named correctly, this
will cause an error.
</p><p>The above example is unwise for a number of reasons,
including the fact that it masks all the CGI programs on our
server. Let's try a slightly more useful Location section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /hello&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::TestModule
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>The above Location section means that every time someone
requests the URL &ldquo;/hello&rdquo; from our server, Apache will run the
&ldquo;handler&rdquo; routine in Apache::TestModule. Because we used a
Location section, we need not worry whether /hello corresponds to a
directory on our server's file system.
</p><p>This is how mod_perl creates a status monitor:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /perl-status&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::Status
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>Each time someone requests the /perl-status URL from our
server, the <span   class="bold"><b>Apache::Status</b></span> module
is invoked. This module, which comes with mod_perl, provides us
with status information about our mod_perl subsystem. Again,
because we use a Location section, we need not worry about whether
/perl-status corresponds to a directory on disk. In this way, we
can create applications that exist independent of the file system.
</p><p>Once we have created this Location section in httpd.conf, we
must restart Apache. We can send it an HUP signal with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall -HUP -v httpd
</pre><p>or we can even restart Apache altogether, with the program
<span   class="bold"><b>apachectl</b></span> that comes with modern
versions of the server:
<pre     class="programlisting">
apachectl restart
</pre>


Either way, our PerlHandler should be active once Apache restarts.
</p><p>We can test to see if things work by going to the URL /hello.
On my home machine, I pointed my browser to http://localhost/hello
and received the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; message soon after. If you don't see
this message, check the Apache error log on your system. If there
was a syntax error in the module, you will need to modify the
module and restart the server as described above.</p><p>The first time you invoke a PerlHandler module, it may take
some time for Apache to respond. This is because the first time a
PerlHandler is invoked on a given Apache process, the Perl system
must be invoked and the module loaded. You can avoid this problem
to a certain degree with the
<span   class="bold"><b>PerlModule</b></span> directive, described
later in this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x29339b0"></a>Results</h2></div></div><p>The subroutine we just created might seem trivial, but it
demonstrates the fact that we can easily modify the behavior of our
web server simply by writing a Perl subroutine. Moreover, since
subroutines can contain just about any sort of Perl code, we have
at our disposal all of the Perl modules, operators, functions and
regular expressions that would be available to a stand-alone
program.</p><p>Indeed, our &ldquo;handler&rdquo; routine is simply an entry point to
what can be a large, complex program with other subroutines. Since
Perl*Handler modules have access to Apache at every stage of
operation, we can modify anything using Perl. A growing library of
modules that do many common tasks is available, so that you can
spend time on the particulars of your problem, rather than
reinventing the wheel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2933b10"></a>Another Module</h2></div></div><p>Let's write another PerlHandler module, but this time let's
have it do something other than return its own output. Just for
fun, we will have it turn headlines in a file into Pig Latin. (In
Pig Latin, the first letter of each word is moved to the end of the
word, and &ldquo;ay&rdquo; is tacked on to the end.)</p><p>We will call our PerlHandler module
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::PigLatin</b></span>, which means we
will create a module named PigLatin.pm and put it into the Apache
module subdirectory. The source code is shown in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="3351l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>We install our module with a Directory section in
httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/share/htdocs/stuff&gt;
SetHandler perl-script
PerlHandler Apache::PigLatin
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>Make sure the directive points to an actual directory in your
Apache document tree.
</p><p>The module introduces several new ideas, but nothing
revolutionary. For starters, we import the constants OK, DECLINED
and NOT_FOUND. As we indicated earlier, we will use OK to indicate
that our PerlHandler did something, and DECLINED to indicate that
Apache should apply some other behavior. We will use DECLINED to
ensure our PerlHandler works on HTML-formatted text by checking
<b  >$r-&gt;content_type</b>. If the MIME type is
&ldquo;text/html&rdquo;, we will operate on the file. If it is a JPEG image,
we will refrain from translating it into Pig Latin, returning
DECLINED.</p><p>Next, we attempt to open the file from
<b  >$r-&gt;filename</b>. This particular module is being
used as a simple PerlHandler, so we can be sure the translation
from URL to a file name on the file system has been performed. This
translation takes place in the TransHandler stage, which we can
modify by writing a PerlTransHandler, rather than a simple
PerlHandler. While it has translated the URL into a file name on
our system, Apache has not checked to see if the file exists&mdash;that
is our job. If we cannot open the file, we will assume it does not
exist, returning the symbol NOT_FOUND.</p><p>Now things get interesting: we grab the contents of the file
and perform a substitution on headlines&mdash;that is, anything between
<b  >&lt;H\d&gt;</b> and <b  >&lt;/H\d&gt;</b>,
where <b  >\d</b> is a built-in character class matching
any digit.</p><p>We use <b  >.*?</b> to match all characters rather
than a simple <b  >.*</b>, so as to turn off the
&ldquo;greedy&rdquo; feature in Perl's regular expressions. If we were to say
<b  >.*</b> rather than <b  >.*?</b>, we would
match all characters between the first &lt;H\d&gt; and the final
&lt;/H\d&gt;, rather than between the first pair, the second pair,
and so forth. Greediness is usually a good thing when working with
regular expressions, but can be frustrating under these
circumstances.</p><p>We use four options in our substitution, using evaluation
(<b  >/e</b>), case-insensitivity
(<b  >/i</b>), global operation (<b  >/g</b>)
and the <b  >.</b> regexp character to match
<b  >\n</b> (<b  >/s</b>). This allows us to
perform the substitution in one fell swoop, as well as catch any
headlines that might begin on one line and continue on the next
one.</p><p>Inside the substitution we invoke
<span   class="bold"><b>pl_sent</b></span>, which is a subroutine
defined within our module. This subroutine is not invoked directly
from mod_perl, but is there to assist our &ldquo;handler&rdquo; routine in
doing its work.</p><p>What's more, pl_sent invokes another subroutine,
<span   class="bold"><b>piglatin_word</b></span>, which translates
words into Pig Latin. If we were interested in creating a large web
application based on mod_perl, you can see how it would be possible
to do so, creating a number of subroutines and accessing them from
within &ldquo;handler&rdquo;. C programmers might think of &ldquo;handler&rdquo; as the
mod_perl equivalent of &ldquo;main&rdquo;, the subroutine invoked by default.
Once in that routine, you can do just about anything you
wish.</p><p>The pl_sent routine is interesting if you have never stacked
<span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>map</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>join</b></span> before. We split
<b  >$sentence</b> into its constituent words across
<b  >\s+</b>, which represents one or more whitespace
characters. We then operate on each element of the resulting list
with map, running piglatin_word on each word. Finally, we piece
together the sentence in the end, using join to add a single space
between each word. The result is returned to the calling
<b  >s///</b> operator, which inserts the translated text
in between the headline tags.</p><p>It is a much tougher problem to handle paragraphs, partly
because people often forget to surround paragraphs with &lt;P&gt;
and &lt;/P&gt;, relying on the fact that browsers will forgive them
if they simply say &lt;P&gt;. In addition, paragraphs contain
punctuation which makes a good Pig Latin translator harder to
write.</p><p>There is no limit to the kind of filters you can write.
Perhaps the most interesting and advanced are those that use Perl's
<span   class="bold"><b>eval</b></span> operator to evaluate little
pieces of Perl code inside HTML files. A number of these already
exist, such as Embperl (discussed several months ago) and EPerl.
More simply, you can ensure that every file on your system has a
uniform header and footer, removing the need for server-side
includes at the top and bottom of each file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2934a30"></a>Reducing Memory Usage</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> is an exciting
development that has already made a great many new applications
possible. But there is a trade-off for everything, and mod_perl's
additional functionality comes at the expense of greater memory
usage. It is hard to calculate the additional memory needed for
mod_perl, but keep in mind that Perl can be a bit of a memory
hog.</p><p>In addition, while lexical (&ldquo;my&rdquo; or &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;)
variables disappear after each invocation of a Perl module rule via
mod_perl, global variables stick around across invocations. This
can be an attractive way to keep track of state in your program,
but it can also lead to larger memory allocations.</p><p>For example, if your module creates an array with 10,000
elements, that array will continue to consume memory even after the
program is invoked. This might be useful in some cases, such as
when a complicated data structure is referenced in each invocation.
However, it also means the large structure will constantly eat up
memory, as opposed to only when necessary.</p><p>You can reduce memory usage by forcing mod_perl to share
memory among Apache child processes. When you run Apache as a web
server, it &ldquo;preforks&rdquo; a number of processes so that incoming
connections will not have to wait for a new server process to be
created. Each of these preforked servers is considered a separate
process by Linux, operating independently. However, Apache is smart
enough to share some memory among server siblings, at least to a
certain degree.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> takes advantage of
this shared memory by allowing the various server processes to
share Perl code as well. However, there is a catch: you must make
sure the Perl code is brought into mod_perl before preforking takes
place. Perl modules and code compiled after the split occurs will
raise the memory requirement for each individual server process,
without regard to whether the same code has been loaded by another
process.</p><p>In order to load code before Apache forks off child
processes, use the PerlModule directive in the configuration
files.</p><p>If, for example, you use the statement</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlModule Apache::DBI
</pre><p>in one of the *.conf files, then
<pre     class="programlisting">
use Apache::DBI;
</pre>


in a PerlHandler module, the latter invocation does not actually
load any new code. Rather, it uses the cached, shared version of
<span   class="bold"><b>Apache::DBI</b></span> that was loaded at
startup by mod_perl.
</p><p>You can load multiple modules with PerlModule, using the
syntax</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlModule Apache::DBI Apache::DBII Apache::DBIII
</pre><p>However, you can load only ten modules this way. If you want
to load more, you can use the PerlRequire directive. Strictly
speaking, PerlRequire allows you to specify the name of a Perl
program to be evaluated only when Apache starts up. For example,
<pre     class="programlisting">
PerlRequire /usr/local/apache/conf/startup.pl
</pre>


will evaluate the contents of startup.pl before forking off Apache
child processes. However, if you include a number of &ldquo;use&rdquo;
statements in startup.pl, you can effectively get around
PerlModule's ten-module limit.
</p><p>Remember that PerlModule or PerlRequire is necessary for
modules to be shared among the different Apache sibling server
processes, but it is not sufficient. You will still have to import
the module in your own program in order to reap the
benefits.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2935110"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>When I first started to work with mod_perl, I thought it was
useful for speeding up CGI programs and for running filters like
Embperl. As I have grown more dependent on it in my own work, I am
amazed and impressed by the power mod_perl offers programmers
looking to harness the power of Apache without the overhead of
external programs or the development time associated with C.</p><p>As you can see, writing mod_perl modules is not difficult and
is limited only by your imagination. It does require that you think
a bit more carefully about your programs than when you are working
with CGI, since you can affect the Apache server in ways that will
slow it down or otherwise hurt your system's performance.</p><p><a href="3351s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
