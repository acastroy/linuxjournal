develop and sell their own distribution of Linux. Xi Graphics'
maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde/OS incorporates Red Hat Linux 4.2,
Xi Graphics' Accelerated-X Display Server, and the Common Desktop
Environment (CDE) used in many commercial UNIX installations. The
target market for maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde/OS is
enterprises wishing to run a commercially supported Linux
distribution and the well-known CDE on their desktop workstations.
</p><p>I did not receive a boxed set from Xi Graphics, but simply a
CD in a jewel case. My assumption is that they would most likely
provide the same box and documentation as their CDE product,
maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde. I installed the distribution on a
Pentium 166 with 24MB RAM, a 4.3GB hard drive and an S3 Trio64
video card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268b580.0x2783a80"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>After creating the installation floppies, I booted from the
floppies, which launched the installer program. The installer for
maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde/OS is practically the same as Red
Hat Linux 4.2. I used <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> for
partitioning, which can be difficult for a beginning user, but a
competent UNIX system administrator should not encounter any
difficulties. No choices were offered as to which packages were to
be installed; the program simply installed 133MB worth of software.
After installing the necessary packages, the installer ran the
Accelerated-X registration and configuration program. The program
did not autodetect my video hardware; I had to select the video
card from a supplied list.</p><p>All things considered, the installation is not difficult for
the experienced user. Given that the target market is not the
consumer, this may be warranted, much like the installation for
Caldera OpenLinux. In contrast, the latest version of Red Hat Linux
has an easier installation, with automatic disk partitioning
setups, easy package choices and video autodetection.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3249f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The Common Desktop Environment
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268b580.0x2783e48"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The Accelerated-X configuration program allows the user to
choose which video card, input device and monitor are to be used.
If you prefer editing text files, the configuration information is
available in the file /etc/Xaccel.ini. Configuration for CDE is
generally quite difficult compared to other desktop environments
available for Linux. Reading through the CDE manual is recommended
to understand how applications are added and how the environment
can be configured.</p><p>Most of the other configuration features are inherited from
Red Hat Linux 4.2. The control panel allows for user configuration,
time and date, printer, network, modem and package
configuration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268b580.0x2783fa8"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>Xi Graphics maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde/OS features the
Accelerated-X Display Server and maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde,
Xi Graphics' CDE implementation. Other featured software included
in the package are Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0, ImageMagick, Netscape
Communicator 4.05, the Xanim movie viewer and the xmcd CD player.
These applications are integrated into the CDE desktop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268b580.0x2784160"></a>Documentation and Support</h2></div></div><p>I didn't receive any documentation, so I cannot comment on
its quality. However, good sources of documentation would include
the maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde manual (for learning how to
use CDE) and the Red Hat Linux 4.2 User's Guide, available at Red
Hat Software's web site.</p><p>Technical support for installation of
maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde/OS is included at no charge for 30
days after registration. Corporations can purchase additional
support packages from Xi Graphics. Of course, you can always go to
traditional channels of Linux support, including newsgroups and
mailing lists. Since it is so similar to Red Hat 4.2, many Linux
users will be able to provide support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268b580.0x2784370"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>At under $200, maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde/OS is sold at
the same price as maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum cde without the
Linux distribution. I would suggest getting the product with the
operating system for two reasons. First, the Linux distribution
included has been configured and tested with CDE. Second, you can
still install their display server and CDE product on another
distribution, from the /cde directory on the distribution CD. Of
course, license restrictions still apply.</p><p>Xi Graphics has provided an excellent product for corporate
UNIX users wanting to take advantage of Linux without a steep
learning curve. Most commercial UNIX administrators are familiar
with CDE on desktop workstations, and expect an integrated and
supported package as provided in maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum
cde/OS. The Accelerated-X Display Server is also a benefit for
graphical workstations, as it provides better speed than XFree86
for many video cards. Of course, maX<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span>mum
cde/OS does have its limitations, namely the lack of glibc support
found in the latest Linux distributions.</p></div></div>
