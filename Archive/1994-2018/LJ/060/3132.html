    If you are looking for an easy way to access your network
    services, AWK scripting provides the means.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23ce3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>What does the scripting language AWK have
to do with networking? In the May 1996 <i  >LJ</i>, Ian
Gordon introduced us to AWK and demonstrated how to solve common
problems with this scripting language that is part of Linux and
every UNIX-compatible operating system. He summarized:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If your main concern is getting a working program
written as quickly as possible, you probably do not want to wrestle
with C or C++ for a week to perfect the most efficient algorithm.
By trading off the speed advantages and control features of C (or
another compiled language) for ease of use, gawk lets you get the
job done quickly and relatively painlessly.</p></blockquote></div>

With this kind of efficiency in mind, it would be nice to also
access network services with short AWK scripts. However, standard
AWK has no functions for networking, and most AWK users would
probably object to the introduction of such functions. AWK should
stay the small, simple and powerful language it is now. Release 3.1
of GNU AWK does not introduce special functions for socket access
(as Perl and C have), but uses a special file name for it. By
treating network connections like files, even novices can write web
clients with a few lines of AWK.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23ce608"></a>Finding Who is Logged In</h2></div></div><p>Let's look at an example. It asks the
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> service of your local
machine if a particular user is logged in.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN {
 NetService = "/inet/tcp/0/localhost/finger"
 print "
 while ((NetService |&amp; getline) &gt; 0)
   print $0
 close(NetService)
}
</pre><p>Store this script in a file named finger.awk and let GNU AWK
3.1 execute it by typing
<b  >gawk&nbsp;-f&nbsp;finger.awk</b>. The strange pipe
symbol, <b  >|&amp;</b>, is the second and last addition
to the AWK language needed for networking. When communicating over
a network, we have to use <b  >|&amp;</b> instead of
simply <b  >|</b>.
</p><p>After telling the service on the machine which user it is
looking for, the program repeatedly reads lines that form the
reply. When no more lines are received (because the service has
closed the connection), the program closes the socket before
finishing. Try replacing
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i></b> by your login
name or the name of someone else logged in. If you want a list of
all users currently logged in, replace
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i></b> by an empty
string (<b  >""</b>). Also, change
<b  >localhost</b> to another machine name in your local
network; doing so allows you to watch who is logged in on machines
at remote locations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23cebe0"></a>The Coke Machine</h2></div></div><p>Okay, this is not really an exciting application. The result
you get is identical to the one you get by typing
<b  >finger&nbsp;<i><tt>name</tt></i>@localhost</b>
at the shell prompt. So, let's try a really useful application.
Today, many Coke machines are connected to the Internet. A short
list of such machines can be found at
http://www5.biostr.washington.edu/~jsp/coke.html. There, you see
that the way to access them is identical to what we did in our
first (and not so exciting) example&mdash;a finger request. Let us take
the first Coke machine from the list and ask the machine which
kinds of soft drinks are available there.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN {
 NetService = "/inet/tcp/0/cs.wisc.edu/finger"
 print "coke" |&amp; NetService
 while ((NetService |&amp; getline) &gt; 0)
   print $0
 close(NetService)
}
</pre><p>Usually you get a reply with information on the different
flavours of Coke and root beer currently available. If you have an
account there, you can also order a drink. Many other machines of
this kind are connected to the Internet. (See Resources.)
</p><p>Both examples shown would work even if we deleted the final
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span> command, because the
operating system closes any open connection by default when a
script reaches the end of execution. In order to avoid portability
problems, we always close connections explicitly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23ceef8"></a>The Weather in Germany</h2></div></div><p>Unlike the Coke machine service, most web services we access
usually transmit HTML pages across the Internet with a protocol
named HTTP. To most people, this is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>
Internet. Can we access the <span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> Internet with
GNU AWK? Certainly. We just have to make sure we connect to port 80
of the web server instead of the finger port. This way, we can
connect to the Yahoo machine and let it tell us the weather
conditions at the place we live.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN {
 NetService = "/inet/tcp/0/
 print "GET http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/Bremen_DL_c.html" |&amp;
   NetService
 while ((NetService |&amp; getline) &gt; 0)
   print $0
 close(NetService)
}
</pre><p>Before starting this script, make sure you know which proxy
server your provider uses and insert its name into the second line.
If you do not use a proxy, insert the name of the web server
(weather.yahoo.com). The result is the HTML content of the web
page. It is up to your scripts to bring it into a more readable
form or to extract the details of interest for further processing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23cf160"></a>Reading the Ticker</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes we are not really interested in viewing a web page.
Imagine a web robot (or agent) that looks at the quotes of the
Motorola stock shares every 15 minutes and sends you an e-mail if
the price hits a certain limit. A command-line call that is
executed every 15 minutes is easily written and stored in a shell
script. Also, depending on the content of a data file, sending an
e-mail is as straightforward to write as a shell script. Here is a
script that reads the ticker for you:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN {
 NetService = "/inet/tcp/0/
 print "GET http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=MOT&amp;d=v1" |&amp;
   NetService
 while ((NetService |&amp; getline) &gt; 0)
   print $0
 close(NetService)
}
</pre><p>Again, you must insert your proxy's name into the second
line. During execution of the script, a request is sent to Yahoo's
quote server and the resulting web page should be redirected to a
file by you. With a <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> command,
the price can be extracted from the HTML text and compared to the
limit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23cf370"></a>Advanced Applications</h2></div></div><p>In these examples, we have seen how useful applications can
be written built on the same simple framework. This framework
represents only a small fraction of what can be done with GNU AWK's
networking device. Both TCP and UDP connections are available and
both clients and servers can be written. More of the advanced
applications can be seen in the small manual that supplements the
official documentation distributed with the GNU AWK sources. (See
Resources.)</p><p>Treating network connections like files is not a feature
unique to GNU AWK. When TCP/IP was integrated into BSD UNIX in the
early 80s, the creators of the socket API originally intended
networking connections to appear as special files even to the user.
But networking turned out to have many special cases which could
not be handled in a uniform way with file handling. Later, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Portal File System</em></span> approach was integrated
into BSD UNIX. Portals are similar to GNU AWK's special file but
are integrated as a file system into the operating system. This
works well because the user can even establish connections at the
shell prompt. The most recent implementation of the Korn shell
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>ksh93</em></span>) provides virtually the same concept
(/dev/tcp) at the shell level. None of these approaches has gained
wide acceptance among users. Even Richard Stevens' article on
Portals (see Resources) has not changed this.</p><p>One other approach to networking at the shell level that has
gained some acceptance during the past year is the tool
<span   class="bold"><b>netcat</b></span>. Originally a kind of UNIX
hacker tool, it simply binds the standard input and output of a
process to a network connection. It knows TCP as well as UDP, can
behave as a server and allows &ldquo;port scanning&rdquo;, i.e., checking if
there are servers listening at certain ports. This tool is simple
to use and powerful, but some of the comments in the source code
are quite unprofessional. Seldom have I seen such a large number of
indecent curses, foolish hype and pure ignorance in a source file.
Recently, <span   class="emphasis"><em>netcat</em></span> has been ported to Windows
NT. To a humble user of NT, such a tool is like a long-awaited
revelation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23cf688"></a>Microsoft Windows</h2></div></div><p>Back to pure <span   class="emphasis"><em>AWKism</em></span> and the different
forms this belief takes on. On which platforms other than Linux is
the networking feature of GNU AWK 3.1 available? It should work on
all UNIX systems that comply with the XPG4 rules; this includes
every UNIX that has a significant market share. Although the exact
release date for GNU AWK 3.1 has not been set, this new feature
should also work on Microsoft Windows 95 and NT as a part of the
Cygwin tool set as soon as both are out. Cygwin is a
UNIX-compatible programming environment that runs on top of
Microsoft's Win32 API. It is currently available only as a beta
release, but is already able to compile its own set of
sources.</p><p>When this article was written, compilation of GNU AWK 3.0.3
worked fine, but 3.1 caused problems. If you intend to compile the
sources in this environment, be prepared to experience some
trouble. Most importantly, avoid compiling on the same machine you
are using for networking with GNU AWK. In case you have only one
machine available, reboot between compiling and testing. As of
release B20 of the Cygwin tool set, clients and servers written in
GNU AWK worked on Windows 95 but no server worked on NT 4.0 SP3. As
of release B20.2, the compiler supports linking the file gawk.exe
statically with all needed dynamic libraries. This would allow for
distributing the GNU AWK interpreter as one single executable, but
this executable does not work. Those problems should be solved by
the time you read this; therefore, networking on Windows 95 should
work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22d6580.0x23cf840"></a>Trade-Offs</h2></div></div><p>We have seen that network access through a special device is
good enough for many useful applications, but there are advanced
features we have to trade off for this convenient access method.
Some things are simply not possible within the easy-to-use
framework AWK employs, namely:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>broadcasting</p></li><li><p>non-blocking read</p></li><li><p>timeout</p></li><li><p>forking server processes</p></li></ul></div><p>In spite of the lack of these advanced features, advanced
applications such as a prototype &ldquo;web server&rdquo; or a &ldquo;mobile
agent&rdquo; have been implemented in GNU AWK. If you need, and can
handle, features like broadcasting or non-blocking read, you should
use Perl or C instead of AWK.</p><p><a href="3132s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a>
