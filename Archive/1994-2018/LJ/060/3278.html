    Wondering about the new frame-buffer features in the kernel?
    Mr. Pranevich gives us the scoop.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbce3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is a fascinating and fast-paced
beast. It seems like only yesterday the hardy developers of the
Linux kernel were busily putting the finishing touches on ELF
support, loadable modules and SMP (Symmetric Multiple
Processing)--things we take for granted today. In those days, more
time was spent on the critical hurdles, the ones that would turn
Linux into the great server platform it is today. In today's Linux
world, more time is spent on the less critical components of the
system: new file systems, television and radio cards and
parallel-port drives. I feel the increased interest in the
operating system by the world's corporations will make even more
&ldquo;non-critical&rdquo; hardware be supported in the future.
</p><p>Linux 2.2 is a milestone for Linux's development. No longer
is Linux a niche operating system&mdash;it is a viable solution for the
masses. With support for so many new options, it's no
wonder.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbce500"></a>Part I. What We Have Today</h2></div></div><p>Text-mode, Linux's most basic output method, is also one area
where Linux has changed little since the &ldquo;old&rdquo; days. The
text-mode console of Linux 2.0 is pure in its simplicity with one
obvious (and maybe striking) fact: no code for graphical primitives
is in the kernel. The lowest level interface to the text-mode
kernel is as simple as the file stream. Higher level functions,
such as would be required for full-screen text console applications
(Pine, etc.), are done through a superset of the vt100 terminal
protocol. Libraries, such as ncurses, are built on top of this to
simplify programming and to provide a sort of terminal abstraction.
Applications written for Linux's text-mode console using this
abstraction can run on just about any terminal. Scroll back and
Linux's famous virtual consoles are not a sophisticated extension
of those basic building blocks, but rather an extension provided
because of the text-mode driver's close relationship to the VGA
hardware on which it was designed.</p><p>Other utilities exist, such as SVGATextMode, which allow us
to access some of the graphical capabilities of hardware in text
mode. These utilities generally allow one to change text
resolution, fonts and colors. However, these extensions directly
interface VGA features and do not call on any extensions in the
kernel. Generally, the Linux console is so modular in design that
it does not notice the low-level VGA feature changes. These
utilities should not be confused with SVGALib or the frame-buffer
console, as they allow manipulation only within the hardware's text
modes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbce660"></a>SVGALib (SVGA Library)</h2></div></div><p>There is obviously quite a bit more to modern hardware than
simple text modes. As mentioned before, kernel hooks are not
provided for accessing these functions, but many user-space
programs and libraries are available that bypass the kernel
altogether to access the hardware beneath. (&ldquo;User space&rdquo; is a
term used to describe the limited and protected &ldquo;space&rdquo; in which
user programs run. In contrast, &ldquo;kernel space&rdquo; routines are
generally unprotected and can cause crashes and other problems.
User protections can be removed in order to allow user programs to
access hardware.) Unfortunately for SVGALib, the most popular
alternative, the support API provided is heavily tied to the
features of the VGA hardware, making it difficult to port either
the SVGA library or the end application to any other type of
hardware. The other downside is that this library does not support
all VGA hardware at its full potential, but that can be forgiven
due to the turbulent nature of hardware design. Limitations aside,
SVGALib has proven to be a stable and popular solution to the
console problem and is the primary interface used in Quake and
other games.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbce768"></a>The X Window System</h2></div></div><p>The final and most popular option for accessing the video
hardware under Linux is through the X Window System, the most
common GUI subsystem for UNIX. The X Window System includes an &ldquo;X
Server&rdquo; which is similar in purpose to a Windows-style video
driver. In addition to &ldquo;driver&rdquo; features, the X server includes
code for running programs over a network and handling many GUI
tasks internally. In this respect, the &ldquo;driver&rdquo; portion is not
truly separate from the &ldquo;server&rdquo; portion. A program that wishes
to access the video hardware would do so by communicating with the
X server through its API.</p><p>The first and most obvious disadvantage of this approach is
that it would be difficult, if not impossible, on some setups to
run a &ldquo;console&rdquo; (full-screen) application via this method.
Second, because of the combined driver/server features of the X
system, servers tend to be very large, making it difficult to allow
programs to run in low-memory situations. The third disadvantage of
this approach is that it is fairly common for companies to profit
by selling closed-source X servers for new hardware. However, the
primary advantage of this system, having a long-standing and
cross-platform pillar to base graphical applications on, seems to
outweigh the negatives.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbce8c8"></a>Non-i386 Linux</h2></div></div><p>Thus far, I have managed to not even mention the role
frame-buffers play in current Linux kernels. The frame-buffer
console system has been a staple of several other UNIX systems for
quite some time and several Linux flavors, in particular Linux/m68k
and Linux/PPC. The issue on those platforms that made the
frame-buffer console so important is a simple one: not all video
hardware supports a built-in text-mode. On these systems, the
frame-buffer console is not a new luxury which brings up a boot
logo, but rather a requirement for functionality. On these systems,
the picture is a tad different. They still have X, of course, and X
is an excellent way of creating applications in a
device-independent fashion. A special X server designed
specifically for dealing with frame-buffer systems has nearly
always been available. The picture on those systems is also
simplified, since no library is available that would enable them to
run SVGALib applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbce9d0"></a>Security Implications</h2></div></div><p>Under the current implementation, a number of security
concerns must be raised when dealing with the graphics subsystem.
It is partly because of these security implications that the
frame-buffer console has become a part of the Linux 2.2
kernel.</p><p>Hardware access to user programs must be provided through a
kernel API which provides a layer of device abstraction. To keep
the system secure and crash-free, the kernel interface must be
carefully designed, as it is within the kernel that the most damage
can be done. Access to hardware is dangerous; it would be quite
easy to crash the machine if a user program could access it
directly. Also, badly designed kernel interfaces could reveal
sensitive data about a user, breaches of security, no matter how
difficult to exploit, are taken very seriously in the Linux
developer community. While no kernel provisions exist for direct
hardware access, there are certain workarounds which can be used to
circumvent these restrictions&mdash;in a way that is as secure as
possible.</p><p>There are two exceptions to the &ldquo;no direct access&rdquo; rule.
The first is simple: with programs run by root, the system
administrator (who should generally know what she is doing) can
access any files and any hardware directly. In fact, there are
virtually no limitations as to what root can do. But you certainly
don't want your users having the root password and using it each
time they want to run Quake, do you? The second exception is the
solution to this issue: the owner of a program (generally root) can
set a flag called the &ldquo;setuid bit&rdquo; (Set User ID) on a program,
allowing regular users to &ldquo;be&rdquo; the other user as far as the
program is concerned. Thus, if root owns the file and it has the
setuid bit set, that program will always have root access and
therefore will always be able to access hardware directly. In this
special and well-controlled case, end users can run their Quake or
their X servers despite the fact that they normally wouldn't be
able to access the hardware directly.</p><p>Note, however, that not all graphical programs will need to
be &ldquo;setuid root&rdquo; to operate. X programs in particular do not
access any hardware directly. Rather, they communicate to the X
server via an API which then translates what they want to do onto
the video hardware. SVGAlib applications, in contrast, generally
all need to have special permissions to operate properly.</p><p>The security implications of having an arbitrary program run
as root should be obvious. Linux does not currently have a method
of saying that a particular program can &ldquo;just&rdquo; access any file or
&ldquo;just&rdquo; access hardware directly&mdash;work is progressing in this
area. Instead, a &ldquo;setuid root&rdquo; application can do anything,
including shutting down the server. Talk about a denial of service!
Thus, these applications must be <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span>
carefully written so that an errant user cannot do anything that
would violate the security of the box. It is up to the
administrator of the site to maintain and ensure these special
programs are used only when absolutely necessary, otherwise gaping
security holes will result.</p><p>Even a carefully written program can sometimes be cracked via
&ldquo;stack smashing&rdquo; to gain root access if a programmer does not
make sure to watch his buffers and use safer routines like
<span   class="bold"><b>strncpy</b></span> instead of
<span   class="bold"><b>strcpy</b></span>. In general, programmers
who write &ldquo;setuid root&rdquo; applications should be aware of any
buffers used throughout the program. For the record, strcpy and
strncpy are both functions that copy text data (strings) from place
to place in memory. The &ldquo;n&rdquo; in strncpy means there is a maximum
number of characters to be copied. Otherwise, it would be possible
for a cracker to manipulate data in such a way that the data being
copied is larger than the place to which it is copied and the
excess would overwrite memory. If they are skilled, this excess
could include program code which would then be run to break into a
shell or do other damage&mdash;and it would be executed as root.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbced98"></a>Part II. Linux 2.2 Implementation</h2></div></div><p>Under the hood, Linux 2.2's text mode was designed to be a
more modular system with defined interfaces and less of a
dependency on VGA hardware internals. The casual observer will not
notice either of these improvements. This is the same text mode we
have come to love. However, improvements were made to allow better
serial consoles for machines without video hardware and to allow
for the turning off of virtual consoles, but these features are not
expressly part of the text-mode driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbceea0"></a>Frame Buffers</h2></div></div><p>Frame-buffer devices are the biggest new video feature of
Linux 2.2 for i386. Unlike earlier versions of Linux, it is
possible through the frame-buffer device to access the video
hardware of a machine directly and in a device-independent manner.
All the basic graphics primitives are supported, although
acceleration is not generally supported at this time. Exactly how
accelerated architectures will fit in is still a matter of debate.
Some point to user-mode programs and libraries (such as GGI);
others believe the best location for at least some types of
acceleration is in the kernel. Note that, in contrast to the
text-mode driver, there is no character cell display&mdash;it is handled
elsewhere. SVGAlib applications and, to a lesser extent, X
applications can both obtain approximately the same level of
control over video hardware, but they are usually less portable and
more of a security risk.</p><p>In addition to those features, it is now possible to access
the frame-buffer devices through the use of device nodes, just like
any other device. As an example, these device nodes, /dev/fd*, can
be used to get a screen capture simply by doing a standard copy
command.</p><p>Above the frame buffer is the frame-buffer console (fbcon).
This is where the standard vt100+ terminal emulation is
implemented. In fact, the emulation is so good that the end user
may not even notice the system is in graphical mode. At this level,
the kernel has a much larger control over fonts and other features
formerly provided through utilities such as SVGATextMode.</p><p>Now, all of these features are great, but the major feature
that will probably be the reason most Linux users try out the
frame-buffer driver is the boot logo. Yes, now you can finally have
a cute little picture of Tux carrying a beer whenever you turn on
your computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf0b0"></a>Security Implications</h2></div></div><p>Not nearly as many security problems exist under the new
system as under the old. Programmers who write graphical
applications do not need to be as careful as their legacy
counterparts, since they are protected by the user-level security
of the kernel. System administrators will also have fewer &ldquo;setuid
root&rdquo; applications to track, making their security audits easier.
In contrast, there will be more code in the kernel that could go
awry, and kernel developers will need to keep the new video
subsystem as bug-free as the rest of the Linux kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf1b8"></a>Part III. Advantages of the Frame Buffer</h2></div></div><p>My favorite feature of the new kernel subsystem, if it were
to go into wide use, can be summed up in two words: cross-platform
compatibility. Simply put, applications written to use the frame
buffer will be immediately portable to all Linux platforms. This is
in direct contrast to the current SVGALib system which does have
some cross-platform compatibility&mdash;but only on systems with
VGA-like hardware. This will, in theory, make compiling any
graphical application on multiple Linux architectures as easy as
compiling an application with ncurses is today.</p><p>Bear in mind, however, that this argument does not apply to X
applications which are already cross-platform. Rather, this level
of compatibility would help with X at a somewhat lower
level.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf318"></a>Single X Server</h2></div></div><p>Another advantage of having a single level of abstraction for
video hardware at the kernel level is with X servers. Unlike older
X servers which needed to concentrate on the specific features of a
class of video cards, frame-buffer-aware ones can concentrate
solely on the networking and other X aspects while allowing the
kernel to handle video specifics. In my perfect world, that would
allow developers more time to look at X issues rather than video
issues. If a developer was still interested in developing video
code, he or she could always look to the kernel for something to
do.</p><p>The X server for the frame buffer is already available as
Xfree86-FBDev and has shipped with some distributions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf478"></a>Part IV. Disadvantages of the Frame-Buffer
Driver</h2></div></div><p>One of the largest downsides of the new kernel driver system,
and the one that has been getting the most attention, is the
question of stability. Will these new frame buffers impact the
outstanding uptimes of modern Linux? The answer is simply no. One
of the glorious things about Linux is that you are generally never
forced to do things you don't want and disabling the frame buffer
is as easy as a recompile (if the distributions even ship with it
by default&mdash;something I highly doubt).</p><p>It is my opinion that Linux developers reach a higher
standard than some other software developers do. (This might
explain why I've never gotten anything more than teeny bits into
the kernel myself.) Even in a worst-case scenario, a rampant kernel
module is only somewhat more dangerous than a rampant &ldquo;setuid
root&rdquo; X server. People accept that risk daily.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf5d8"></a>Lack of Drivers</h2></div></div><p>The new driver system has less supported hardware than its
legacy counterpart. Additionally, the supported hardware is
generally in a sub-optimal or non-accelerated position. In contrast
to XFree and to a lesser extent SVGAlib, that is an order of
magnitude less support. The video subsystem today is a lot like the
sound subsystem was yesterday, i.e., it supports very few cards.
With time and patience, developers will no doubt make this new
system as robust as possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf6e0"></a>Lack of Acceleration</h2></div></div><p>Also, the frame buffer is not meant to be a generic base for
an acceleration architecture. While it is likely that better
acceleration will be provided in the future, we may have to wait
until that becomes generally available. Alternately, it is quite
likely that the GGI project (General Graphics Interface at
http://www.ggi-project.org/) or some organization will propose and
implement a workaround to this situation. Once again, due to the
newness of the system, not all answers are immediate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf7e8"></a>Part V. Other Notes</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat 5.2 (which I use at home and at work) already
includes support for the frame-buffer X server, FBDev. If you are
experimenting with this feature of Linux 2.2 and have Red Hat, this
will save you a download/compile cycle. Unfortunately, at this time
there is no easy way to configure this device; I recommend
consulting the documentation. Red Hat 6.0 may include this feature
or make it easier to use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad6580.0xbcf8f0"></a>VesaFB</h2></div></div><p>To those who want to jump right into the frame-buffer
console, an option exists that works with nearly all VGA-compatible
video cards: the VesaFB driver. It does require a VESA
2.0-compatible BIOS. This driver is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a good
example of what the new features of Linux 2.2 can do, but it does
allow one to get her feet wet. In particular, it lacks support for
resizing the screen resolution and it requires the mode to be
changed at boot time. In reality, this driver is meant only as an
example driver and your mileage may vary getting it into production
work. Users of Linux on other platforms may have a better idea of
how things should be in the end.</p></div></div>
