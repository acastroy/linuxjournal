    This article contains information on how to use and
    configure available DECnet software as well as information
    on how the kernel code works.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3129f3.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x27ec920"></a></h2></div></div><p> DECnet was designed by Digital as a way
to interconnect their range of products. In its Phase IV
implementation, released in 1983, it can support 63 areas of 1023
nodes each. The specifications for DECnet Phase IV are freely
available (see Resources), which has allowed others to provide
DECnet connectivity in products such as Sun's Sunlink DNI and
Linux.
</p><p>In networking terms, DECnet is an old standard. Its limited
address space is far less than that of TCP/IP and it does not have
the advanced features of more modern networking standards. DECnet
is still widely used in legacy systems, and the intention of the
Linux DECnet project was to allow integration of those systems with
Linux-based solutions.</p><p>The Linux DECnet project intends to support only Phase IV
DECnet, since previous versions in current use are very limited in
number these days. LAT, another network protocol designed by
Digital, will not be supported because it is covered by patent
protection and its specifications are not freely available. In this
article, we will use the term &ldquo;DECnet&rdquo; to mean the DECnet Phase
IV family of protocols.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x27ecad8"></a>The DECnet Family of Protocols</h2></div></div><p>DECnet can be carried over a variety of different data link
layers. In the beginning, the Linux kernel DECnet layer will
support only the Ethernet link layer; support will be added later
for other link layers such as PPP, DDCMP and X.25. The PPP link
layer is described in RFC1762 and the others are described in the
DECnet documents (see Resources).</p><p>Like many network protocols, DECnet can be viewed as
consisting of a number of software layers. More details are
included in the section called &ldquo;A Tour of the Kernel
Sources&rdquo;.</p><p>At the top of the stack is the application layer, which
includes all the programs used on a day-to-day basis. These
programs use the system libraries and system calls to create
connections to other nodes. The kernel socket layer interface and
the system libraries encompass what the DECnet standard refers to
as the session control layer. It performs largely the same function
as the library and system calls for TCP/IP. Further down is the
network services protocol (NSP), fairly close to TCP in function.
Below these is Routing, which does more than routing; it is a kind
of IP and ARP rolled into one. At the bottom of the heap is the
actual device over which the data is transmitted.</p><p>Each machine, called a node in a DECnet network, is
identified by an address consisting of a 6-bit area number and a
10-bit node number. These two numbers are written separated by a
dot, so 1.2 is a computer in area 1 with a node number of 2. Unlike
TCP/IP, the address refers to the computer, not the interface
through which communication is to take place.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x27ecce8"></a>Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Two different sets of patches are available to add DECnet
support to the kernel. The currently available code is based upon a
patch written by Eduardo Serrat for the 2.0.xx version kernels to
function as an endnode. In parallel with this, one of the authors,
Steve Whitehouse, was also writing a DECnet layer with an emphasis
on creating a router implementation.</p><p>The result is you can now get the original patch for 2.0.xx
kernels written by Eduardo Serrat (a version of the same code
ported to the 2.1.xx kernel series) and also another patch which
has modifications by Steve to make use of the newer support
functions in the 2.1.xx kernel series. This last patch will be
distributed as an add-on for the 2.2.xx kernel series and later
integrated into the next development series.</p><p>Most of what we say here applies equally to all versions of
the kernel patches. We will point out the differences as we
go.</p><p>First, you need to retrieve the correct patch for your
kernel. In general, the best way to do this is to get a copy of the
most up-to-date kernel in whichever kernel series you intend to
use. You can then download and apply the latest patch to the kernel
source as described below. I also strongly suggest that you study
the release notes for the kernel version you have, since the
configuration procedure may change.</p><p>To apply the Linux DECnet patch, unpack the kernel source
into /usr/src/linux as normal. Then obtain the correct patch for
this kernel version and uncompress it in the directory above the
top-level Linux source directory, /usr/src/ in this case. Then
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ patch -p0 &lt; patch-file
</pre><p><b  >patch-file</b> is the name of the patch you
want to apply. Next you need to compile a kernel in the usual way,
being sure to say <b  >Y</b> or <b  >N</b> to
the question about including DECnet support. Depending on which
version of the patch you have, some of the options outlined below
may be available.
</p><p>The two main types of DECnet nodes are endnodes and routers;
the latter is subdivided into Level 1 and Level 2 varieties. At the
time of writing, only endnode support is available.</p><p>When DECnet router support is available, you will need to
enable the option at compile time. Also, at module load or boot
time, you will have to turn it on&mdash;a kernel with router support
compiled in will be able to function as both an endnode and a
router.</p><p>The DECnet <span   class="emphasis"><em>raw sockets</em></span> option allows the
reading and writing of DECnet packets at a lower level than users
normally need. It is very useful for debugging and monitoring
activity, and might be required by future user-level routing
daemons. The main advantage of using this rather than a
<b  >PF_PACKET</b> socket is allowing a program to take
advantage of the kernels filtering of invalid DECnet
packets.</p><p>In order to use the DECnet kernel layer, you must also tell
the kernel which DECnet address to use. This is the only point at
which the instructions are dependent upon the kernel version being
used. For 2.0.xx version kernels, you need the
<span   class="bold"><b>startnet</b></span> program, which would
normally be run in the boot scripts for your system. For the 2.1.xx
version kernels and upward, the DECnet address can be set either on
the command line with an option <b  >decnet=1,2</b> or
when the module is loaded. (That is a comma, not a dot, between the
<b  >1</b> and <b  >2</b> in the previous
sentence.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x27ed478"></a>Setting Up Ethernet Cards</h2></div></div><p>Those of you familiar with TCP/IP will recall that the ARP
protocol is used to allow a machine to discover the Ethernet
address of other nodes attached to the network. No equivalent of
this protocol exists in DECnet; nodes must have their Ethernet
address set according to their DECnet node address.</p><p>In order to work out which Ethernet address to use, you take
the four byte &ldquo;hiord&rdquo; prefix specified by the DECnet protocol and
concatenate it with two bytes <span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>yy</em></span>, derived from the DECnet node address of
the node you are configuring.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
AA:00:04:00:
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>yy</em></span> are the
least and most significant bytes of the 16-bit DECnet address,
respectively. The bytes are ordered this way because the original
systems upon which DECnet was implemented had little endian CPUs.
Thus, a node with address <b  >1.1</b> will have an
Ethernet address of <b  >AA:00:04:00:01:04</b> and a node
with address <b  >1.2</b> will have an Ethernet address
of <b  >AA:00:04:00:02:04</b>.
</p><p>This address needs to be set in your Ethernet card before you
start the card. On Red Hat systems, this is easy. You simply add
the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MACADDR=AA:00:04:00:02:04
</pre><p>to the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 or
whichever file corresponds to the Ethernet card you wish to use. If
you are not on a Red Hat system, you will probably have to look
through the startup scripts to find the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command for the relevant
interface and add the options <b  >hw ether
AA:00:04:00:02:04</b> at a suitable place. If you are using
Slackware, then /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 is the correct file to modify.
</p><p>If this seems too complicated, a utility called
<span   class="bold"><b>dn2ethaddr</b></span> can be used to print
out the Ethernet address of a node given the DECnet address on the
command line. It can also be used within scripts; an example is
given in the man page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x27edbb0"></a>The File Utilities</h2></div></div><p>The front end for the DECnet layer that most users will see
is the file utilities, a collection of programs using the kernel
socket layer to implement file transfer and other useful
applications. Eduardo Serrat's original kernel patch came with a
few example applications, which have been taken over by Patrick
Caulfield and enhanced during the last few months.</p><p>Most of the supplied applications for DECnet use the DAP
(Data Access Protocol) that performs a similar function to the FTP
protocol in TCP/IP. DAP is one of many high-level protocols
implemented on top of DECnet; cterm is another, which provides
terminal access in a similar manner to TELNET on TCP/IP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x2be5f60"></a>Files and File Names</h2></div></div><p>The applications use the OpenVMS transparent DECnet file name
format to refer to files on remote machines. This syntax should be
familiar to OpenVMS users, although it may look a little odd to
Linux users.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nodename"
</pre><p>For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tramp"patrick mypass"::[docs.html]art.html
</pre>


The more eagle-eyed will notice that typing this file name into the
bash shell causes it all sorts of problems because the shell has
special meanings for quotation marks and square brackets. To get
around this, we have to enclose the entire file specification in
single quotes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dncopy 'tramp"patrick mypass"::[docs.html]art.html'\
art.html
</pre>


This command copies the file from the OpenVMS system to our Linux
machine. If you're wary about having passwords visible on the
command line, read the sidebar on DECnet proxies. Although not
every DECnet file name you type in will contain special shell
characters, it is a good idea to get into the habit of using the
single quotes so that you don't get unexpected effects if you
forget them when they are needed.
</p><p>The syntax of file names on an OpenVMS machine is also a bit
different from that in Linux. Directories are enclosed in square
brackets and delimited with dots. File names can have 39 characters
on either side of the dot and both are case-insensitive. OpenVMS
displays them in upper case but they can be referred to in lower
case. The Linux file utilities will always convert the file names
to lower case for you, since that is more convenient for Linux
users.</p><p>OpenVMS treats a file as a collection of records rather than
a stream of bytes. It likes to know how to delimit the records,
whether they are fixed or variable length, and how to display them
on the screen (carriage control).</p><p>The file utilities available in version 0.10 are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span>: copies
files between OpenVMS and Linux systems.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dntype</b></span>: displays
the contents of an OpenVMS file on standard output.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dndir</b></span>: displays a
directory listing.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dndel</b></span>: deletes
OpenVMS files.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dntask</b></span>: execute
commands on an OpenVMS system.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span> is the most complex
of all: it uses what may seem to be a bewildering list of options.
A file on Linux is simply a collection of bytes, whereas OpenVMS
has a very rich file system. Files can have different
organizations, record formats and attributes (see &ldquo;OpenVMS File
Types and Attributes&rdquo;).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span> has to cope with the
task of making sensible conversions between the &ldquo;a file is a file
is a file&rdquo; attitude of Linux and the more sophisticated OpenVMS
system. When copying files from OpenVMS to Linux, OpenVMS makes all
the information about the file available as part of the network
protocol, so this operation rarely requires a user to understand
the nature of the remote file.</p><p>When copying a file to OpenVMS, the situation is more
complex. <span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span> has to tell
OpenVMS what type of file it wants to create, what the record
format will be and any other optional attributes that may be
required. We have tried to make the default as useful as possible,
so that if you copy a Linux file to OpenVMS, you get a useful file.
OpenVMS has a file type that is analogous to Linux files in the
SEQUENTIAL STREAMLF file. This is a sequential file you can seek
with records delimited by line-feed characters: when you use dncopy
to send a file to OpenVMS, this is what you will normally get. In
fact, dncopy goes further than that and actually looks for records
in your file when it sends it in order to make it meaningful to
OpenVMS.</p><p>STREAMLF files are fine, but often you want to send
block-structured data files or OpenVMS savesets that have been
backed up or downloaded from the Internet, or perhaps you want your
text files to be in the more normal OpenVMS text file format. This
is what all the complicated options in dncopy are designed to help
you with.</p><p>A few examples may help illustrate. Normal OpenVMS text files
have variable length records with implied carriage control. To send
a file from Linux like this, we would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dncopy -rvar -acr myfile.txt \
   'tramp"patrick mypassword"::'
</pre><p>The option <b  >-rvar</b> instructs dncopy to tell
OpenVMS that the resulting file is to have variable-length records.
<b  >-acr</b> indicates that the records have implied
(carriage-return) carriage control. Also notice the resulting file
name has been left off. <span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span>
will use the base name of the source file (myfile.txt) in this
case.
</p><p>Alternatively, if you were sending a file to be used in a
FORTRAN program, OpenVMS has a FORTRAN carriage control attribute,
where the first byte of each record says whether to start a new
line, new page, etc.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dncopy -rvar -aftn fortfile.txt \
   'tramp"patrick mypassword"::'
</pre><p>If you wanted to send an OpenVMS saveset (a bit like a Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> file), you would send a file
with fixed-length records. The normal mode of dncopy is to send
records, since records are what OpenVMS expects. Binary files have
no real record structure so we must tell dncopy to send blocks of
bytes and the size of those blocks. A common size for saveset files
is 8192 blocks, so we could send a saveset file from Linux to
OpenVMS with the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dncopy -mblock -b8192 saveset.bck\
   'tramp"patrick mypassword"::'
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>dncopy</b></span> takes wild-card characters
for both Linux and OpenVMS file names. (OpenVMS wild cards must be
used for OpenVMS files: % for a single character and * for multiple
characters.) As a result, you can copy whole directories at a time.
It can also redirect by using standard input and standard output as
destination files, with the hyphen as a file name. In this way, you
can embed OpenVMS files in Linux shell scripts and pipelines.
</p><p>One &ldquo;feature&rdquo; of dncopy you may never need but which grew
out of its object-oriented design is that it will also copy Linux
to Linux and OpenVMS to OpenVMS. Note that if you do an OpenVMS to
OpenVMS copy, all the data will pass through your Linux box on its
way.</p><p>dntype</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dntype</b></span> is really just a
symbolic link to dncopy that forces it to send the file to standard
output; it is really there just to provide consistency and save
typing.</p><p>dndir</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dndir</b></span> is a directory command
(quite like <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> in Linux). It
displays the OpenVMS directory in a format similar to the ls
command. It takes a few switches to customise the format, though
<b  >-l</b> is probably the most used, as it displays
most of the useful information.</p><p>Two fields that look different from ls are the file size and
protection information. The file size is shown in 512 byte blocks
and the file protection information is shown in OpenVMS format
rather than Linux format. I chose to leave the protection display
this way, because OpenVMS has more file protection bits than Linux
and it is often helpful to be able to see all the
information.</p><p>dndel</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dndel</b></span> deletes OpenVMS files.
Like dncopy and dndir, it can take an OpenVMS wild card file name
to delete multiple files. With the <b  >-i</b> option,
you will be prompted whether you really want a file to be
deleted.</p><p>dntask</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dntask</b></span> is the only one of
these programs that does not use the DAP protocol; instead, it
communicates with an arbitrary DECnet object. One little-used
feature of DECnet on OpenVMS is that by using the syntax
<b  >TASK=filename</b>, the command
<span   class="bold"><b>filename.COM</b></span> will be run as a
command procedure (the OpenVMS equivalent of a shell script) and
the output can be redirected back to the calling task. Three
example tasks are provided with the distribution. One simply issues
a <b  >SHOW&nbsp;SYSTEM</b> command which sends its
output to the Linux machine (using the command <b  >dntask
tramp::show_system</b>). The output from this is analogous to
the Linux <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> command. Another
sends the <b  >-i</b> (interactive) flag to dntask to
allow the user to interact with a shell on the OpenVMS machine.
However, the following example is the main reason dntask
exists.</p><p>Eduardo Serrat, who wrote the kernel layer for DECnet, made
sure it was compatible with X11R6. This means that if you have
DECnet support compiled into your X server (see
http://linux.dreamtime.org/decnet/Xservers.html for pre-built X
servers with DECnet support), you can start X Window System
applications on an OpenVMS machine and have them display on a Linux
machine. This is a cheap and efficient way to provide X terminal
support for OpenVMS systems. The dntask program can issue a command
to start any X program to display on the Linux machine, provided
you write a suitable remote command procedure. The example below
shows a DECterm being started (something I personally use quite a
lot), but it could also be used for more sophisticated things, such
as starting a complete CDE session when a user logs in to Linux and
starts X.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dntask 'tramp::decterm'
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x2be7820"></a>Other Utilities</h2></div></div><p>Eduardo also provides the following useful DECnet
utilities:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sethost</b></span> provides
terminal access to OpenVMS machines, similar to TELNET.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ctermd</b></span> is a daemon
that provides the opposite service, allowing OpenVMS users to
<b  >SET HOST</b> (or TELNET if you prefer) to a Linux
machine.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>dnmirror</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>dnping</b></span> are test utilities for
checking that the software is installed correctly and verifying
connections to particular OpenVMS nodes.</p></li></ul></div><p>All the above utilities and the X servers depend on libdnet
which is available from our web site (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x2be7da0"></a>A Tour of the Kernel Sources</h2></div></div><p>For the kernel hackers, here is a quick spin around the
relevant source files. This section applies only to the newer
kernel patches (i.e., for the 2.1.xx series and up), as those are
the ones we expect you'll find most interesting and useful.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3129f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. DECnet Software Layer Diagram
</p></div></div><p>A diagram showing the overall layout of the Linux DECnet
layer is shown in Figure 1. Where we describe the DECnet protocol,
we go into just enough detail to give an idea of the main features
of each part of the kernel code. If you want to know more about the
way the kernel code works, you will need to read a copy of the
DECnet specifications (see Resources) and then look at the source
directly.</p><p>The main source file is af_decnet.c. This file contains the
socket layer interface and parts of the DECnet NSP and session
control layer code. Since the DECnet layering model does not map
exactly onto the socket code, session control is provided partly by
the kernel and partly by a user space library called
libdnet.so.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dn_raw.c</b></span> contains the code
which implements the raw socket layer. It was one of the first
things written, since it is very useful when debugging to see what
is going on &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo;. It is also a good example of how to
write the simplest socket layer interface possible. The file is
compiled only when the raw sockets option is configured.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3129f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. State Diagram of the NSP Layer
</p></div></div><p>The rest of the NSP layer is divided into two parts: one for
dealing with outbound packets, dn_nsp_out.c, and one for incoming
packets, dn_nsp_in.c. The state table for the NSP layer is shown in
Figure 2. We won't say much about the diagram here, but it should
be a useful aid when used in conjunction with the kernel
code.</p><p>The Routing layer is rather problematical. It has been
divided into several files, due to the fact that the Routing layer
actually does much more than just routing. dn_route.c is the main
file which deals with incoming and outgoing packets, and dn_dev.c
provides support for device-specific functions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dn_neigh.c</b></span> has a split
personality. When a node is running as an endnode, it provides the
On-Ethernet Cache described in the DECnet specifications; for
routers, it provides the adjacency database. Since they are so
similar, the decision was made to merge the two functions in order
to keep the code small.</p><p>The actual routing functions (compiled only when the node is
configured as a router) are in dn_fib.c. The code in this file is
very experimental at this time, as decisions are still being made
regarding how much of the routing should be done in user space and
how much in kernel space.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x2af8e40"></a>Main Kernel Code Paths</h2></div></div><p>One of the more obscure and important parts of the code is
the main path for outgoing data packets. The DECnet layer uses the
protocol-independent destination cache written by Alexey Kuznetsov,
and neighbor table code written by Alexey Kuznetsov and Pedro
Roque. These were originally designed to do some common processing
required by the IPv4 and IPv6 network protocols, with the intention
that other protocols would begin to use them at a later
date.</p><p>What exactly do these two bits of code do? We will start by
describing the neighbor table. The idea behind this is simply to
keep a list of known nodes which are directly connected, along with
certain information used by the protocol in question to communicate
with them. In the case of TCP/IP, this means the ARP subsystem; for
DECnet, it is used to hold one of two things. For endnodes, it
holds the list of known nodes on the directly connected networks
with which communication can be established, known as the
On-Ethernet Cache. For routing nodes, it holds what the
specifications describe as the adjacency database. In both cases,
the function is the same but the actual method of operation is
slightly different.</p><p>In the endnode case, hello messages are sent by routers every
ten seconds to all endnodes that are directly connected. They are
used by the endnode to create entries in the On-Ethernet Cache.
Should a hello message not be received for a certain length of
time, normally one minute, the entry is removed from the list. A
default router is a directly connected node to which packets should
be sent if the endnode is not connected directly to the
destination. The default router is determined by information in the
received hello messages.</p><p>For routing nodes, hello messages are received from both
endnodes and other routers and are used to update the adjacency
table. In this case, the entries are removed if no hello messages
are received for a length of time&mdash;a specified multiple of a time
length noted in the hello messages. Currently, the neighbor table
does not support different timeouts for each different neighbor.
This problem is being worked on and may be solved by the time you
read this.</p><p>One other piece of information held in the neighbor table is
the format of header to be used by the routing layer in
transmitting NSP data. There are two formats, one for use over
broadcast links (long format) including Ethernet, and one for use
over point-to-point links (short format). This is done by setting a
pointer to a function to the correct routine
<span   class="bold"><b>dn_long_outout</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>dn_short_output</b></span> when the table
entry is created.</p><p>The destination cache is based on principles similar to the
neighbor table. However, the object is to hold information required
for each destination. When a packet is to be sent to a certain
destination, it is looked up in the destination cache to see if it
exists. If so, then that entry is used; if not, a routing algorithm
must be called to discover the correct destination.</p><p>The routing algorithm also depends upon the routing or
non-routing type of the node. The algorithm for routers has not
been properly implemented yet, but will reside in the file dn_fib.c
when that time comes. For endnodes, the algorithm is simply to send
directly to any node in the On-Ethernet Cache, to send to the
default router if it is not in the cache, or to send directly if
there is no default router.</p><p>Again, a function pointer is available in each destination
entry for a routine that will add destination-specific information
to outgoing packets, then call the output routine of the
neighbor.</p><p>That about wraps up the main features of the kernel code.
There is, of course, a lot more to it than what is mentioned here,
but we hope our overview will be useful if you're planning to add
features or help with debugging. If you have specific questions,
we'd be happy to try to answer them; however, please read the
documentation first and also remember that we may not always be
able to send an answer right away.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f4580.0x2af92b8"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Hopefully, we have given you a good overview of the
