    Providing network information to customers on an Intranet saves both
    time and money for this international chemical company.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2102580.0x21fa348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Kemira is a chemical company which
employs approximately 10,000 people and has plants in Europe, the
U.S. and Asia. Kemira got into IP-networking early by building
KemNet, an IP-based Intranet out of Cisco routers, in 1989.
</p><p>Mission-critical information systems, such as process
automation computers, are located on-site in many of Kemira's
plants. IT professionals run and manage these systems and they rely
on KemNet to do their job efficiently. These IT professionals are
the primary internal customers for my unit, and we support them by
determining answers to the following questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>How is the network performing?</p></li><li><p>Do they have too little or too much network
capacity?</p></li><li><p>Is the telecommunications operator delivering as
promised?</p></li><li><p>Is a particular problem network-related or
not?</p></li><li><p>If KemNet is the cause of the problem, how will we
avoid it in the future?</p></li></ul></div><p>The challenge for our department is to provide our IT
professionals with enough information so they can handle most
network management tasks on-site. This allows us to keep our
organization small (currently two employees each working half-time)
and costs down.
</p><p>Since the people using network management services are
located on three continents, we decided to use e-mail and web
technology to create a &ldquo;self-service network management center&rdquo;
in Kemira's Intranet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2102580.0x21fa920"></a>Linux Network Management Tools</h2></div></div><p>Many methods can be used to extract information from an IP
router network. One nice feature of Cisco routers is their ability
to log all types of network incidents using a
<span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span> daemon. These syslog
messages can then be further processed with Perl scripts to create
web pages or send e-mail messages. These messages are a great help
in finding problems in routers and links or even in measuring usage
of dial-in links.</p><p>Another popular method of getting network information is by
using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), the standard for
managing IP networks. Many open-source tools for gathering and
processing SNMP data are available. One tool we found useful and
easy to set up is MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher), which
gathers traffic load information from router interfaces. (See
Figure 1.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3256f1.large.jpg"><img src="3256f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MRTG Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>A third tool for getting performance information is good old
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span>. By periodically measuring
ping round-trip times, you can find the times when your network is
most congested. Then, by checking the actual traffic volume using
mrtg, you can see if the telecom operator is delivering what he has
promised.</p><p>Most international data communication lines are delivered
using frame-relay technology. Frame-relay services are priced using
a committed information rate (CIR) for all conditions and access
speeds. Measuring sometimes gives interesting results and may save
your company money in the next frame-relay agreement.</p><p>With a 100MHz Pentium Linux server, a couple of Perl scripts,
Apache and a few open-source tools, we turned these three network
information sources into an automated, web-based, network
information center. Our customers can now troubleshoot those
problems they believe to be KemNet-related much faster, saving
working hours and downtime.</p><p>Another application for Linux is work-flow automation. Our
trouble-ticket volume is so small that it did not justify buying a
full-blown trouble-ticket system. Instead, we use Hypernews, a
web-based news group collaboration tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2102580.0x21fae48"></a>Linux in the Corporate World</h2></div></div><p>Maintainability is always a question when using open-source
products. For us, the question is easy because our network
management services would not exist without open-source tools. We
tried to deliver &ldquo;self-service network management&rdquo; using a
well-known and expensive commercial product. We soon found that
even keeping this tool running required frequent visits from a
vendor's consultant with a fee of over $1000/day. Using it to make
the network information available on the Web would have been
extremely expensive to set up and maintain.</p><p>All our self-built software consists of short (a maximum of
20 lines) Perl scripts run from
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> or CGI. Anyone with minimal
Perl experience will be able to maintain these scripts. We don't
use compiled languages and keep our scripts as simple as possible
to ease maintenance.</p><p>Security is another issue that needs constant attention. In
security audits, I have noticed consultants give extra attention to
each Linux box found in the corporate Intranet. Fast-developing
Linux software may introduce new security problems, and the
powerful features of Linux give both the cracker and the
administrator the potential to generate security holes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2102580.0x21fb058"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Our customers feel they can do their job better now that they
can access real-time network information with their browser. A
telephone call to a human operator sitting in front of his
expensive network management workstation cannot give them this
service. We also feel that open-source tools and in-house scripts
can be easily maintained and secured for a corporate
environment.</p><p>We are expanding our use of the Linux platform into new
applications such as directory services, log file management and
network traffic analysis.</p><p><a href="3256s1.html" target="_self">Tools for Linux-Based Network
