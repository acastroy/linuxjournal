Solutions</h2></div></div><p>Thanks to Marjorie Richardson for mentioning KDE in the
article &ldquo;Linux and Enterprise: A Winning Combination&rdquo; in the
January supplement to <i  >Linux Journal</i>. As
initiator of the KDE project, I would like to add a few
things.</p><p>KDE is far more than a desktop, as she seems to indicate. The
main targets are not only users of the standard components (like
the window manager or the startup panel), but also developers.
Although it contains a window manager, file manager and a startup
panel (what users usually call &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo;), this is only half the
story. KDE is mainly a sophisticated application development
framework. It makes it possible for programmers to create better
applications for Linux in a much shorter time.</p><p>The main reason Linux has suffered from few and poor
graphical applications was no free technology was available with
which to build them. Every free software developer had to reinvent
the wheel over and over, starting with a configuration system and a
help browser and ending with a printer driver or at least a
PostScript engine. KDE's success and the ever-increasing number of
KDE-based applications demonstrate impressively what effect a
desktop standard makes on productivity, and&mdash;even more
important&mdash;the fun of programming. Note that &ldquo;desktop standard&rdquo;
refers to the library level, object model and common helper
applications; it has nothing to do with the way the windows are
decorated or how users launch applications.</p><p>Thus, KDE is one answer to the &ldquo;applications, applications
and more applications&rdquo; cry she mentions. I am talking about real
applications here, including usable versions of a PowerPoint-like
application (kpresenter), advanced vector drawing tools
(killustrator), a document processor (KLyX), two advanced
spreadsheets (ksiag and kxcl), a state-of-the-art web browser
(konquerer), news reader, mail client and many smaller utilities
such as image viewers, multimedia tools, games, text editors, et
al.</p><p>Please have a look at http://koffice.kde.org/ and
http://www.kde.org/applications/ for more information.</p><p>&mdash;Matthias Ettrich ettrich@troll.no</p><p>Hope you liked the article in February's issue, &ldquo;KDE: The
Highway Ahead&rdquo; by Kalle Dalheimer &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc5580.0x10bd4a8"></a><i  >LJ</i> in Brunei</h2></div></div><p>I cannot believe what happened to me two days ago when I went
into a bookshop in the country Brunei, Darussalam, where to my
knowledge I am the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> Linux user. What did I
see in the computer magazine section? A <i  >Linux Journal</i>!</p><p>Thanks for giving me a great magazine even in a country
without Linux.</p><p>&mdash;Stefanus Du Toit sdt@ultracool.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc5580.0x10bd768"></a>Calendar</h2></div></div><p>I liked the article &ldquo;Take Command: Calendar Programs&rdquo; by
Michael Stutz (<i  >LJ</i>, January 1998), so I
installed <span   class="bold"><b>calendar</b></span> on my machine.
With my system (Red Hat 4.1 and tcsh), I got &ldquo;unterminated
string&rdquo; errors from entries like &ldquo;John's birthday&rdquo;. This is a
consequence of the method by which GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>cpp</b></span> manages quotes. I found a good
workaround is to include this line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(calendar &gt;/dev/tty) &gt;&amp; /dev/null
</pre><p>in my .cshrc file instead of just
<b  >calendar</b>. It does not fix the errors, but it
does throw them away.

Editor</h2></div></div><p>First of all, we at IGEL wish the <i  >LJ</i>
staff a happy, healthy and successful 1999!</p><p>In issue 57 on page 32 (&ldquo;1998 Editor's Choice Awards&rdquo;, Best
New Hardware&mdash;Corel NetWinder), Ms. Richardson states, &ldquo;Corel
Computer is the first company to declare Linux ...&rdquo; This statement
is simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>wrong</em></span> and misleading. IGEL was the
first company to introduce a Flash Linux-based Network
Terminal/Computer or Thin Client back in 1994. <i  >Linux Journal</i> even tested the unit at the time and printed a
very positive product preview. This unit, then called Etherminal
3X/4X, is now replaced by the Etherminal W/J Thin Client series,
which began selling much earlier than Corel's NetWinder. The
functionality of Etherminal W and J goes beyond that of the
NetWinder and has a much better price/performance ratio.</p><p>I would appreciate a printed correction of this statement,
since our product marketing uses this time and functionality
advantage publicly, and we do not like having to continuously argue
against her statement.</p><p>On page 75 (&ldquo;New Products&rdquo;) is a short announcement about
the release of Etherminal J, and we are very thankful for this
mention. The following statement was cut from our press
release:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In addition, Etherminal J supports Citrix
MetaFrame and Citrix WinFrame via the integrated ICA Client for
Linux, and Tekcentric WinCentric via an integrated WinCentric
Client for Linux. RDP support is planned to be released in the
future as well. This makes Etherminal J the only universal &ldquo;All in
One&rdquo; Thin Client Workstation available.</p></blockquote></div><p>In the same article, the price of the product is now
outdated. The new pricing is strictly based on quantity, ranging
from $590 to $899 US. Reseller pricing is available.
</p><p>Last, I'd like to offer an article on IGEL as a company,
supporting and using LINUX as its only OS for any product offered
now and in the future. We have some very interesting product plans
which will literally take Linux and IGEL's Flash Linux technology
to new highs in 1999.</p><p>Thank you for your interest and continuous support!</p><p>&mdash;Hans L. Knobloch President and CEO, IGEL LLC</p><p>My apologies for my misstatement with regards to the
NetWinder. The Etherminal was indeed first. I would like to talk to
you more about your company. &mdash;Marjorie Richardson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc5580.0x10be0b0"></a>Re: Linux in Lebanon</h2></div></div><p>These comments are about the article entitled &ldquo;Linux in
Lebanon&rdquo; by Ibrahim F. Haddad which appeared in the January 1999
issue.</p><p>I was pleasantly surprised to see <i  >LJ</i>
cover Linux usage in our country and commend Mr. Haddad on a nicely
written article. I would, however, like to point out that company
usage of Linux has been somewhat downplayed. Our company is almost
exclusively a Linux shop, and we have created very large web sites
which are served on Linux machines.</p><p>For example, LebHost (http://www.lebhost.com.lb/) is a
comprehensive search engine about anything related to Lebanon, and
our main web site offers free web sites to Lebanese
(http://www.greencedars.com.lb/). Both sites are Linux-based and
very heavily visited. We also have dozens of hosted domains on
Linux machines as well.</p><p>In our case, it was clearly not a matter of &ldquo;follow the
crowds&rdquo;, even though Microsoft software is &ldquo;freely available&rdquo; in
a pirated form here. We find Linux much more attractive to use
because of performance, flexibility, superb support and source code
availability.</p><p>&mdash;Edmond Abrahamian, PhD. edmond@greencedars.com.lb</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc5580.0x10be370"></a>Csound Article</h2></div></div><p>I read the article in February's <i  >LJ</i>,
&ldquo;Linux Csound&rdquo; by David Phillips. I think you should add a link
in the &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; section to the Quasimodo Project,
http://www.op.net/~pbd/quasimodo/.</p><p>This project is a rewrite of Csound for UNIX, supporting
multi-threading, with enhanced real-time performance, GUI, modular,
etc. A first ALPHA (without GUI) is available now. When this
project is finished, it will be absolutely the coolest Software
Synthesizer System that has ever existed.</p><p>&mdash;Thomas huber@iamexwi.unibe.ch</p><p>SSC's Distribution Choice</p><p>I am a little confused over which distribution to get and
install on my machine. All seem fine for most tasks. I remembered
in a past issue of <i  >LJ</i> that SSC uses the Debian
distribution. Why was Debian your choice over other distributions?
Was it because it is an all-volunteer distribution versus
commercially-based distributions such as Red Hat, Caldera and
others?</p><p>Additionally, if I choose a distribution other than Red Hat,
I fear I may not be able to purchase software products because
companies are specifically alliancing themselves to support only
Red Hat instead of all major distributions (or, rather, certain
components used in all distributions). This is reminiscent of
Wintel systems versus Apple. More software was made to support
Windows. People, like vendors, will go where more is offered.
Distributions that are not Red Hat compliant will be left in the
dust&mdash;a situation that will lead to factions within the Linux
community. Companies need to provide products without requiring Red
Hat be installed.</p><p>&mdash;Jean Tellier jtellier@cts.com</p><p>Yes, our primary reason for choosing Debian was that it is a
volunteer effort. Red Hat is part of the effort to develop
standards for Linux that will keep applications from being
distribution-specific. While many companies have ported their
products to Red Hat first, I don't think any have said they will
not support other Linux versions. Informix came out for Caldera
first but now works for the others as well. Corel's NetWinder comes
installed with Red Hat, but Debian also works well on it. I think
you can pick whichever distribution you wish without
worry &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc5580.0x10be790"></a>Non-root Shutdown Possible with sudo</h2></div></div><p>I saw a question in <i  >LJ</i> January 1999
(&ldquo;Best of Technical Support&rdquo;) for which I can provide a
suggestion. The utility <span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> can
be configured to provide non-root shutdown capability.
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> (su do) basically allows
non-root users to execute a restricted set of commands. It
essentially performs an
<b  >su&nbsp;-&nbsp;root&nbsp;-c&nbsp;<i><tt>command</tt></i></b>
but can ensure more restrictive access control and does not require
you to give out the root password.</p><p>On my desktop, I configure it so that any time I want to run
a root command (I log in under a regular user account called
stephen), I just type
<b  >sudo&nbsp;<i><tt>command</tt></i></b>,
and it executes it for me without hassling me. Of course, you can
configure it to require passwords, allow only a single command,
etc.</p><p>More about sudo can be found at
http://www.courtesan.com/sudo/.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen Thomas stephen@thomas.mitre.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc5580.0x10bec08"></a>Name Misspelling</h2></div></div><p>You accidentally spelled Jaroslav's name wrong in your
