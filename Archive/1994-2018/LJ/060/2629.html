    A nice little command to help you modify files.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0a580.0x2b02240"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I started using UNIX in 1982, life
in the computer world was fairly cruel. At that time, most
programmers were still using line editors. The UNIX line editor,
<span   class="bold"><b>ed</b></span>, was a relief in comparison
with most line editors of other operating systems. Its sensible use
of regular expressions was a blessing, and the fun part was that
most UNIX tools used the same kind of regular expressions.
</p><p>Although UNIX had virtual memory, the size of files that ed
could handle was limited; disk space for memory was expensive. For
large files, programmers had to resort to the stream editor,
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> reads its input
line-after-line and performs its editing operations line-by-line.
In sed, some commands allow use of multi-lines and so have a
holding space, but in general, the amount of memory needed is
small.</p><p>Besides the occasional one-line commands, I often wrote sed
scripts. In those days, most system administration scripts were
written in sed; <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> was too slow
and too big. The power demonstrated by those sed scripts was and
still is quite amazing. They were true works of art&mdash;large and
completely incomprehensible, but they got the job done.</p><p>Since sed is Turing-complete, it is as powerful as any
programming language. Writing sed scripts that compute certain
functions became a sport. Olaf Kirch, author of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Network Administrator's Guide</em></span>, says in his preface that
he was proud to have written a prime number generator in sed. My
pet script computes the Ackermann function and is available for
anonymous download in the file
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue60/2628.tgz along with a
short explanation. It is just like programming in assembler.</p><p>Today, sed scripts are totally different&mdash;they are much
simpler and are almost always one-liners. Most one-line sed
commands (often included in Bourne scripts or used interactively in
your shell of choice) modify or delete certain lines in a file. In
some cases, you might still write sed scripts; however, the
commands remain simple. Beside the two operations just mentioned,
you also insert, append and change groups of lines as a
block.</p><p>The advanced sed commands have disappeared (and I must say
I'm glad). Although these advanced commands made sed powerful, they
also made the scripts unreadable. Today, if you need to do
something advanced, you would use awk or Perl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0a580.0x2b026b8"></a>Syntax</h2></div></div><p>I will not describe every feature of sed. Instead, I will
restrict myself to just those commands I regularly use. For more
information on sed, the best resource is <span   class="emphasis"><em>sed &amp;
awk</em></span> by Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins (O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, 1997).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> commands have the
following form with <span   class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> trailing spaces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[address][,address][!]command[<span   class="emphasis"><em>arguments</em></span>]
</pre><p>I will begin with the address. An address is either a line
number ($ for the last line) or a regular expression enclosed in
slashes. The regular expressions are similar to the ones you see in
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> (well, actually the
<span   class="bold"><b>ex</b></span> part of vi): &ldquo;.&rdquo; (any
character), &ldquo;*&rdquo; (any number of the immediately preceding regular
expression), &ldquo;[class]&rdquo; (any character in class), &ldquo;[^class]&rdquo;
(any character not in class), &ldquo;^&rdquo; (begining of line), &ldquo;$&rdquo; (end
of line) and ''\'' (to escape characters where needed).
</p><p>A range of lines can be specified by giving two addresses.
The &ldquo;!&rdquo; after the address specification excludes that range from
being processed. The most commonly used sed commands are &ldquo;d&rdquo;
(delete) and &ldquo;s&rdquo; (substitute). The delete command is
straightforward; it deletes any line that matches the entire
address specification. Substitute is more interesting:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
s/<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern/replacement/</em></span>[g]
</pre><p>Basically, <span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern</em></span> is just a regular
expression, but it has an odd feature: parts of the pattern can be
stored in the replacement. The parts to keep must be enclosed
within the characters &ldquo;\(&rdquo; and &ldquo;\)&rdquo;. In the replacement part,
these stored parts can be used by specifying &ldquo;\1&rdquo;, &ldquo;\2&rdquo;, ...,
&ldquo;\9&rdquo; (the first, the second, ..., and the ninth stored part). If
the entire matched part is to be used, the &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; character is
specified. The <b  >g</b> (global) flag can be used to
replace all occurrences of <span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern</em></span> by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>replacement</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0a580.0x2b02d98"></a>Example</h2></div></div><p>Assume we have a small table of two columns of numbers which
we wish to swap:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
s/\([0-9]*\) \([0-9]*\)/\2 \1/
</pre><p>The &ldquo;[0-9]&rdquo; part matches any digit and the &ldquo;*&rdquo; means that
we allow any string of digits to be matched. Since &ldquo;[0-9]*&rdquo; is
surrounded by &ldquo;\(&rdquo; and &ldquo;\)&rdquo;, it is stored. The first number of
the line will be in &ldquo;\1&rdquo; and the second one will be in &ldquo;\2&rdquo;. In
the replacement, they are recalled: first the second number, then
the first. While it is a bit silly to write a file with just two
lines, it is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/sed -f
s/\([0-9]*\) \([0-9]*\)/\2 \1/
</pre>


The <b  >-f</b> flag means that the next argument is a
file name containing a sed script. The way UNIX executes scripts,
this means the script name will be used as an argument of
<b  >-f</b> (i.e., this file). Here is the one-line
equivalent to be used at the command-line prompt in the shell (the
<b  >-e</b> flag specifies that the next argument is a
sed command):
<pre     class="programlisting">
sed -e 's/\([0-9]*\) \([0-9]*\)/\2 \1/'
</pre>


To perform more than one command on a particular range, use { and }
to bracket a block of commands. Assume that in the header of the
file, we wish to replace C++ style comments (&ldquo;// ...&rdquo;) with C
style comments (&ldquo;/* ... */&rdquo;) and we wish to update the copyright
year. A blank line appears after the header, as shown here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
// Copyright 1997 John Doe
// This is just an example.
...
</pre>


We can use the following script (note the heavy escaping by the
backslashes) to modify this header:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/sed -f"
1,/^$/{
s/Copyright 1997/Copyright 1998/
s/\/\/\(.*\)/\/*\1 *\//
}
</pre>


These commands will modify the above header to be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* Copyright 1998 John Doe */
/* This is just an example. */
...
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0a580.0x2b03210"></a>Insert, Append and Change</h2></div></div><p>The next set of sed commands I often use in scripts are &ldquo;i&rdquo;
(insert), &ldquo;a&rdquo; (append) and &ldquo;c&rdquo; (change). Insert and append are
similar in that they both need an address either before which or
after which text is inserted or appended. The text that is inserted
follows on the next lines. All lines of the insert or append
command must be &ldquo;terminated&rdquo; by a backslash except for the final
line. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1i\
This is a test\
to insert three lines\
at the beginning
</pre><p>With the change command, we can also specify a range of
lines. If we specify only a single address, only that line will be
changed; otherwise, the entire range will be modified.
</p><p>Sometimes it is handy to read (&ldquo;r&rdquo;) from or write (&ldquo;w&rdquo;)
to a file. In the case of a read, we can specify an address after
which the file is to be read; in case of a write, we can specify
one address or a range to be written to the file. For example, to
write the lines preceding the first empty line to a file called
foo, type the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/sed -f 1,/^$/w foo
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> is quite picky about
spaces&mdash;only one space after &ldquo;w&rdquo; or &ldquo;r&rdquo; is allowed. Also, never
use trailing spaces in sed commands; it doesn't like them and will
give cryptic errors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0a580.0x2b03528"></a>Next and Quit</h2></div></div><p>The last two commands I will discuss are next (&ldquo;n&rdquo;) and
quit (&ldquo;q&rdquo;). The next command takes a single address. After the
specified line is output, the next line is read and the script
resumes at the top. Normally, next commands are found within blocks
of commands (i.e., within curly braces). The quit command also
takes an address as an argument. When sed encounters quit, it
immediately terminates the script without any further
output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a0a580.0x2b03630"></a>Advanced</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> has several other
commands, which can be considered advanced commands. You won't see
them in modern sed scripts. Three sorts of advanced commands are
available:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Conditional commands: in sed, you can define labels
by preceding an identifier (7 characters at most) by a colon
(&ldquo;:&rdquo;), then using the test (<b  >-t</b>) command to
jump to that label. Test checks if substitutions have been
made.</p></li><li><p>Multi-line commands: sed has several commands that
work with multiple lines, treating them as if they were a single
line with embedded newlines. These commands make it hard to read
sed scripts.</p></li><li><p>Holding space commands: sed is capable of saving
and exchanging the current line with a separate line, called the
holding space. What is true for multi-line commands is even more
true for commands that handle the holding space&mdash;they truly make
your scripts unreadable.</p></li></ul></div><p>As I said earlier, use sed for one-line commands and simple
scripts and awk and Perl for advanced commands. For those who wish
to earn a virtual beer: write a sed script that computes the
factorial function.
