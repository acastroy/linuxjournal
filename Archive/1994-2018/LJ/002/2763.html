countries with the most Linux users. While this may be biased by
the fact that the Linux Counter itself is based in Norway, it's
certainly true that Linux is gaining a foothold there. In the
latest issue of the magazine `Mellvik Rapporten', a serious (Appx.
$600 / 12 issues) report about open systems and Unix, Linux got a
very favorable review. Still, there is little commercial or
mainstream interest. Most people are connected and get SLS or
Slackware from the ftp sites. They are mostly either Unix gurus
that hack the kernel for fun, or Unix users that want Unix at
home.</p><p>One user tells me that he uses Linux to run a picture
manipulation package (XITE), and that it runs better on Linux than
on a HP 755. Better&mdash;as in the user interface works 100% compared
to 80% on the HP, not better as in faster.</p><p>At the University of Oslo, the Department of Mathematics is
planning to use Linux for one of their machine rooms. This will
give a lot of students Linux experience.</p><p>Magnus Y Alvestad,Oslo NORWAY</p><p>The former Soviet Union is definitely not the best
computerized part of the world (although the situation changes
rapidly now), but there are already 10 to 20 installations of Linux
around here. Most of the systems are in personal use, and used
primarily as mail and news servers. They usually have a uucp
connection to Relcom&mdash;the largest xUSSR &ldquo;professional&rdquo; computer
network. There is a linux directory on one of the Relcom ftp/mail
servers in Moscow, containing fresh kernel releases and some
selected packages.</p><p>Here I would like to mention the importance of free systems
like Linux in the country with a long tradition of pirating
software. Pirating was a policy approved by the government in the
times of communists, and now, in the times of growing market
economy, it is hard to withstand the tradition. The main argument
of the apologists of pirating is the extremely high cost of the
software, as compared to the average income of a person living in
this country. Indeed, say, the Borland C compiler is almost beyond
the reach of an independent programmer. And now we can tell these
people: OK, if you really cannot buy MS/DOS of OS/2 or Windows, you
can go for Linux. You will get an excellent system, with
development tools and all-what-you-want for free, and no one will
accuse you of being a thief. I believe that this fact can play its
role in making our society more civilized.</p><p>Of Linux-related development, I would mention if mail&mdash;a
freeware FidoNet support package that I am writing and that is
currently in beta-testing. Although it works on various Unix
platforms, the development is made on a Linux box.</p><p>Eugene G. Crosser,Moscow RUSSIA</p><p><a href="2763s1.html" target="_self">WAUUG Discusses Linux</a></p></div></div>
