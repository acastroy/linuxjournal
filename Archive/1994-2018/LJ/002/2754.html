  Software
  Foundation (FSF) has written an excellent reference manual, available
  in an electronic form that can be printed or read on-line, but I think
  that an introduction will help some people get started.</p><p>The GNU C Library is more than a re-implementation of the
Standard C Library; while it has all the features of the Standard C
Library, it has far more interesting and useful features as well.
Unfortunately, it is not necessarily a good idea to use all those
features in your programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1d450"></a>GNU vs. Standard</h2></div></div><p>One method that the FSF has used to avoid copyright
infringement lawsuits from unhappy commercial vendors has been to
remove restrictions and arbitrary limits from the GNU versions of
programs. For example, where the standard version of a program
might be limited to handling lines less than 4096 characters long,
the GNU version is likely to handle lines of any length that memory
can hold.</p><p>They have followed the same philosophy in their version of
the C Library: why not make improvements, so long as the library is
still compatible? So where most standard C libraries contain a
<b  >printf()</b> which causes a segmentation violation
when something like <b  >printf("%s", NULL)</b> is
called, the GNU C library prints (<b  >null</b>). This is
not a feature used to print (<b  >null</b>), but a
debugging aid which allows the programmer to find and correct buggy
code more easily, without having to inspect core files caused by
segmentation violations.</p><p>While maintaining POSIX compatibility, the FSF has
significantly extended the C library, making it far more useful in
the process. Unfortunately, when you use these extensions, your
program becomes less portable to other platforms. To make a program
generally useful, the GNU C library should be ported to any
platform where your program might be useful.</p><p>On the other hand, writing good software that requires the
GNU C library may encourage the further spread of the GNU C
library. It may also make your programs work better, since the
better the library the program is built on, the better the program
may be; and some of the higher-level functions may allow you to
write simpler, more maintainable code. You can spend less effort
getting around library limitations. Buggy libraries can waste a lot
of a programmer's time, as veteran programmers know. Since the GNU
C library has a reputation as a good implementation of the Standard
C library, with useful extensions, you may be doing all your fellow
programmers a favor by encouraging the spread of the GNU C
library.</p><p>Another reason to encourage the spread of the GNU C Library
is the very fact that it is free software. It can be a tremendous
help to be able to read library source when you don't understand
what a library function call is doing.</p><p>The linux C library is based almost completely on the GNU C
library and will probably be merged with the GNU C library
eventually. This does not imply that writing programs under linux
requires or encourages writing non-portable programs. The
<b  >-ansi</b> switch for GCC enforces fairly strict ANSI
compliance(1), and by default masks references to all the GNU
extensions from the header files, so that you can be sure your
program is completely portable. Section 1.3.4, Feature Test Macros,
in the GNU C Library Reference Manual, explains how to choose which
features you want included while using the GNU C Library.</p><p>If you write programs based on books like W. Richard
Stevens'&mdash;Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment, Kernighan
and Ritchie's&mdash;The C Programming Language, Donald Lewine's&mdash;POSIX
Programmer's Guide and other such standard references, your code
should be portable to many operating systems as well as to linux.
However, with linux, you have the choice of using GNU-specific
library routines, and of promoting the use of the GNU C library on
other platforms as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1d920"></a>The Meat and Potatoes</h2></div></div><p>For the rest of the column, we will leave such philosophical
ramblings behind and assume that you have chosen to use the GNU C
library in all its glory, above and beyond the ANSI standard and
that you want an introduction to its extensions so that you know
what features are there to be used. I will go through the reference
manual, pointing out and briefly explaining many of the useful
enhancements of the GNU C library. This is not a coherent
discussion of the GNU C library, but a list of extensions that
people intending to use the GNU C library for serious programming
should know about. This way they can decide whether or not to use
the features, rather than being condemned by ignorance to ignore
them....</p><p>If you find these functions worth using, please look them up
in the&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>GNU C Library Reference Manual</em></span>. Don't
try to use them just from my descriptions here - these descriptions
are just to catch your interest. Follow the references
instead.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1dad8"></a>Error Reporting</h2></div></div><p><b  >argv</b> is often checked within
<b  >main()</b> to find out what name was used to invoke
the program. However, for error reporting mechanisms to work, a
variable pointing to <b  >argv[0]</b> has to either be
global within at least some part of your program or be passed
around a lot from function to function and used as an argument to
your error handling functions&mdash;both of which can get rather
messy.</p><p>The GNU C library provides two variables, which are
automatically initialized before <b  >main()</b> is
called, which solve this problem. <b  >char
*program_invocation_name</b> contains an exact copy of the
name found in <b  >argv[0]</b>, and <b  >char
*program_invocation_short_name</b> contains a copy with all
the leading directory names stripped off. So if
<b  >program_invocation_name</b> contains
<b  >/usr/bin/foo</b>,
<b  >program_invocation_short_name</b> contains
<b  >foo</b>.</p><p>With these two variables, error handling functions become a
lot simpler and more generic. It is possible to make clean error
handling functions without these pre-provided variables, but it
requires that you initialize your error handling functions,
probably from <b  >main()</b>, during program
initialization. If you assume that the GNU C library is available,
you can simply access these variables directly, cutting down on the
possibility of programmer error.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1e0b0"></a>Memory Allocation</h2></div></div><p>The GNU C library contains built-in heap consistency
checking, meaning that it can check to see if a program has
violated some of the rules for accessing dynamically allocated
memory. By calling the <b  >mcheck()</b> function before
any memory allocation functions are called, you can ask that some
consistency checks be occasionally made and an error function be
called if there are any inconsistencies.</p><p>You can also define functions that are called directly before
<b  >malloc()</b>, <b  >realloc()</b>, and
<b  >free()</b> are called, to check for errors.
<b  >mcheck()</b> is implemented by using these hooks,
but it is still possible for you to use the hooks even if you are
using <b  >mcheck()</b> because the functions are
&ldquo;chained&rdquo;&mdash;you just need to follow the rules and the example given
in the reference manual to get this to work correctly.</p><p>An <b  >mstats()</b> function is provided, which
gets memory allocation statistics including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The total number of bytes being managed by
<b  >malloc()</b> (etc.), including memory that has been
allocated from the operating system but not allocated to your
program by <b  >malloc()</b>.</p></li><li><p>The number of bytes actually allocated to your
program.</p></li><li><p>The number of &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; that have been allocated
from the operating system, but which are not in use.</p></li><li><p>The number of &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; that are actually in
use.</p></li><li><p>The number of free bytes which have been allocated
by <b  >malloc()</b> from the operating system, but which
are not currently allocated to your program.</p></li></ul></div><p>A dynamic stack allocation facility called
<span   class="bold"><b>obstacks</b></span> is available, and this
can be more efficient for some things than malloc. Obstacks have
some limitations, but they are implemented as macros and are very
quick for small, repeated allocations. They also have a lower space
overhead for each small block than <b  >malloc()</b>
does.</p><p>Obstacks are built on <b  >malloc()</b> in much the
same way that <b  >malloc()</b> is built on the system
call <b  >brk()</b>.</p><p>A relocating allocator is also provided. This is a memory
allocator which provides blocks of memory which may be moved around
at any time behind the scenes, and which are therefore referenced
through a &ldquo;handle&rdquo; which is updated whenever the memory is
moved.</p><p>It can be a little more work to program with relocating
memory because you have to work with, for example, a <b  >char
**</b> instead of a <b  >char *</b>, but if your
program regularly allocates and de-allocates memory in a
more-or-less random way, the relocating allocator can provide
significant memory savings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f155f8"></a>Input and Output</h2></div></div><p>Because there are no really good functions in the standard C
library for reading lines, the GNU C library provides some extra
functions which are not completely compatible but which work much
better. <b  >getline()</b> can safely read a string as
long as memory can hold. <b  >getdlim()</b> is a
generalized version of <b  >getline()</b>, which gets
text until some delimiting character is reached again, without
arbitrary limits on how long the line can be. In these functions
memory is allocated from within the function, instead of the
function requiring you to pass it memory. You are required to free
this memory when you are done with it.</p><p>Safe formatted string I/O is provided by
<b  >snprintf()</b>, <b  >asprintf()</b>, and
<b  >obstack_printf()</b> the first of these is a version
of <b  >sprintf()</b> which knows how long a string it
has to write into; and the other two dynamically allocate whatever
space they need, like <b  >getline()</b> and
<b  >getdlim()</b>.</p><p>The GNU C library provides functions for customizing
<b  >printf()</b>. You can define a <b  >%q</b>
format for the standard <b  >printf()</b>, for example,
and make it do whatever you want. If you would like to be able to
easily print out structures in your application, simply make
<b  >printf()</b> conversions for them, and pass pointers
to structures into <b  >printf()</b>. If
<b  >%q</b> is your generic structure-printing
conversion, and struct foo has been designated as structure number
1, you could make it possible to write: <b  >printf("%1q\n",
&amp;foo)</b>; and have the contents of foo printed out for
you.</p><p><b  >scanf()</b> is compatibly extended so that it
can optionally allocate string storage itself, so, for instance,
you don't have to have a maximum string size.</p><p>It is also possible to do standard I/O on memory, using
functions like <b  >fmemopen()</b> to get a <b  >FILE
*</b> which references memory instead of a file. Now all your
standard I/O functions can be used to write into memory. It is even
possible to define your own types of streams, so you could, for
example, write a set of procedures which allow you to use
<b  >fprintf()</b> to &ldquo;print&rdquo; to something via SYSV IPC
messages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f15f40"></a>References</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The GNU C Library Reference Manual</em></span> is an
amazingly large and comprehensive work. While it's not perfect and
is still being written, it contains a lot of information. I do not
know if it is being published on paper, but it's available via ftp
from all gnu mirror sites and can easily be printed or formatted
for on-line reading from within emacs or the standalone info
reader.</p><p>I'll take some space here to plug, as usual, some of the
books that I have found most helpful, books which I think that my
readers should not be without.</p><p>When you are programming for modern variants of Unix, you
ought not to be without W. Richard Stevens' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced

the information you need to write real applications under most
variants of Unix. Both the principles and the details are covered.

run on more than just Unix platforms (rather the opposite of this
month's column, I'll admit), I recommend Donald Lewine's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>POSIX Programmer's Guide</em></span>. It's hard to go
wrong if you follow this book. ISBN: 0-937175-73-0</p><p><a href="2754l1.html" target="_self">What is the GNU Library Public
