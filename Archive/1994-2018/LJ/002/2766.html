    Now that you have your Linux operating system
    running, how do you keep it running effectively? That is
    the job of the system administrator, also known as root,
    or sysadmin the person who does everything in the
    background that makes sure the machine you are working
    on does not come to a screeching halt in the middle of
    a program.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x220a580.0x23023f8"></a>You as System Administrator</h2></div></div><p>When you booted up your Linux machine, you instantly became
the System Administrator. You may have fewer users, or you may not
be connected to a network, but many of the functions are similar.
Perhaps the only difference is that you know whom to complain to
when the system is not configured properly. As this series
continues, you should be able to get a good grasp on what you have
to do to make your system efficient, secure and user-friendly. And
you'll know how to do it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x220a580.0x2302500"></a>Secure Passwords: The Key to a Secure
System</h2></div></div><p>When you have your machine set up, log in as root. By
default, the root user has no password. So when you are asked for a
password, just hit the ENTER key. This makes it easy to log in, as
you don't have to go hunting around for a password after you set
your system up. The disadvantage to this is that anyone can log in
as root and have free access to your system. The first thing you
must do is to change the password for root. To do this, use the
passwd command. The root's password must be impossible to guess by
normal users. Also, user accounts should be protected with just as
much security. Here are some hints for good passwords:</p><p>1. Do not include anything significant to you, such as a
nickname, phone number, your last name, etc.</p><p>2. Change your password often. (especially if you are on a
network).</p><p>3. Do not use a word that can be found in a
dictionary.</p><p>4. Make your password at least 6 characters long, with a mix
of letters, digits, and/or punctuation characters.</p><p>5. Do not tell anyone your password and don't write it down
anywhere.</p><p>6. Change your password often (just in case you
forgot).</p><p>To change your password, type:
<b  >passwd</b></p><p>Type in your password; then you will be prompted to type it
in again just to make sure you spelled it right the first time. If
the two passwords you entered do not match, your password is not
changed. When you type in your password, it will not be shown on
the screen. This is to prevent anyone around you from seeing your
password.</p><p>A sample password changing run looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# passwd
Changing password for root
Enter the new password (minimum of 5 characters)
Please use a combination of upper and lowercase letters and numbers.
New password:
Re-enter new password:
/#

user-friendly. One way of doing this is by changing two files,
/etc/issue and /etc/motd. The /etc/issue file contains the message
that you see above the login: prompt. This messag e sometimes
contains the name of the site and the operating system. For
example, my /etc/issue file reads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux ver. 0.99.14 (enry)
</pre><p>The next file you'll want to change is /etc/motd. This file
is the one that gets seen every time you log in. Motd stands for
Message Of The Day. This file usually contains a welcome screen and
messages of general importance for all users. For example, my
/etc/motd file has:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
** Welcome to enry **
Good News!  SLIP will be available Real Soon Now.
Send mail to root for more information.
</pre><p>These are just examples. Your setups may look similar to
this, but they don't have to be. There are other ways of making the
system easier for other users (and yourself). For starters, you may
want to look at the man pages for bash, X, and any other kinds of
utility programs you may be using. The man pages are a good source
of information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x220a580.0x2302c38"></a>Multiple drives vs. the single drive
concepts</h2></div></div><p>The idea of a drive in UNIX is much different than it is
under DOS. The Linux (and UNIX) way of looking at drives is as
follows: Each physical drive can be split into partitions (or
filesystem), and each partition can be mounted into a
directory.</p><p>Because of this, there are no drive letters as in DOS; there
is no drive A:, B:, C:, and so on. The users will be dealing with
only one drive, and everything is shown in terms of directories to
the user. You could have one filesystem for the root directory and
other files (the / directory), another filesystem for user commands
(the /usr directory) and another filesystem for user space (the
/usr/users, /home, or /user directory). For example, I have three
partitions that I use: one is for the / directory, one is for the
/usr directory, and the third one is for the /home
directory.</p><p>When I cd into the /usr or /home or / directories or any of
their subdirectories, it is just like using cd from DOS to change
to a subdirectory. I do not have to switch drive letters; I just
have to use cd and I automatically go to that filesystem.</p><p>There are a few advantages to using this system. First, you
can add more total space to the system. If you notice that the
/usr/X386 subdirectory will take up more space than /usr has, you
can create a new filesystem from the unused portion of your drive
and mount that partition to /usr/X386. Second, all file operations
are invisible to both the user and the user's programs. DOS needs a
drive letter and a directory. Linux just needs a directory.</p><p>Linux refers to physical drives, such as the 3.5 inch floppy
drive, as files in the /dev directory. For example, the first drive
(called A: in dos) is /dev/fd0 in Linux. The fd refers to the fact
that it is a floppy drive, and the 0 means that it's the first of
that kind of device. Hard drives are referred to in two different
ways. One way is the physical drive itself, the first or second (or
more) drive. The other way is by partition on that physical drive.
Hard drive entries in /dev are prefixes with hd to signify hard
drive, followed by an an &ldquo;a&rdquo; for the first physical drive &ldquo;b&rdquo; for
the second physical drive, etc. After that, a number specifies the
partition within the physical drive. The first partition is 1, the
second partition is 2, etc. SCSI devices follow the same format,
only their prefix is <span   class="bold"><b>s</b></span>. You can
remember that as<span   class="bold"><b>SCSI</b></span>
device.</p><p>In order to help you think in Linux, here are a few DOS to
Linux ways of thinking of the same drive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DOS                     LINUX
A:                      /dev/fd0
B:                      /dev/fd1
C: (assuming first      /dev/hda1
   partition on the
   first hard drive)
E: (assuming second     /dev/hdb2
   partition on the
   second hard drive)
</pre><p>In my next article I'll discuss making our own filesystem (in
ext2 and xiafs formats), and I'll go over some of the entries in
