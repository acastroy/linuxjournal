    I see Linux as a progressive movement as well as an
    operating system. And, with any movement you need to chart
    your direction. To help with that charting I decided that
    rather than write the April, 1994 editorial I would just go
    ahead and write the one for January, 2000. So, here it is...
  </p><p>In the past 7 years we have seen Linux go from an idea for a
small Unix-like system into a movement to bring affordable,
reliable multi-tasking software to anyone who could buy a rather
minimal computer. In fact, we have seen that in some parts of the
world people are more likely to have a Linux system than be
connected to the electric power grid.</p><p>Now we see Linux and an Internet connection in over 100
million homes worldwide. How did this happen? Cost is the best
answer. Some of you probably remember an old program loader called
MS-DOS. Back in the 1980s it was being marketed as an operating
system and it managed to establish a user base close to that of
Linux today. But it had three fatal flaws:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>it only ran on one type of computer system and
could be expanded to support the full capabilities of new
microprocessors</p></li><li><p>it cost money</p></li><li><p>it didn't support multi-tasking</p></li></ul></div><p>We can excuse the first flaw as it was originally written for
a project at a computer company and was never intended to be
marketed to the general public. Although a more visionary company
might have made a better decision we can only say that hindsight is
20-20.</p><p>The fact that people actually had to pay for a copy of MS-DOS
(or, more properly stated, were supposed to pay for it) could also
be considered as a very short-sighted decision on the part of
Microsoft. As we all know now it is the added value-training,
customization and, of course, the user-specific applications-that
make the money. Giving away operating systems helps to sell these
services along with hardware.</p><p>The final flaw, however, is what resulted in the demise of
MS-DOS. I remember that back in 1986 I gave a talk at a personal
computer user's group meeting in Seattle. I had brought along an
IBM-AT (remember those-it had an Intel 80286 processor in it and
people ran MS-DOS on them) and a couple of H19 terminals (Heath
kit? Another flash from the past for some). I had a version of the
Unix system running on this hardware.</p><p>I talked about Unix systems pointing out multi-tasking as
being a primary benefit. I was amazed when these allegedly
computer-literate people didn't understand why multi-tasking was
absolutely necessary. In fact, one of the group members actually
said &ldquo;I don't like Unix because it accesses the disk when I'm not
doing anything&rdquo;. Today, 99% of the computer system users don't even
know what a disk is, much less a disk access.</p><p>With the advent if ISDN in the early 1990s and personal
satellite stations in the late 1990s, connectivity became the big
issue. People quickly realized that they didn't want to know what
their computer was doing, they just wanted to see the results.
Could you, for example, imagine manually instructing your computer
to call up another computer? Well, Unix systems pretty much
pioneered the initial ideas behind these sorts of computer links
with the advent of the uucp program suite back in the early
1970s.</p><p>When the average user, without using these words, asked for a
multi-tasking computer system, Linux was there and waiting. We have
to give credit to early Linux activists (and <i  >Linux Journal</i> itself)
for going out to companies that intended to market personal
Internet stations and point out that Linux was a more capable and
less expensive base to use for their products. The result, as you
can see today, is that most personal Internet stations are based on
the Linux operating system.</p><p>But there is more to the success of Linux.</p><p>People recognized they would rather pay for service than
&ldquo;things&rdquo;. Linux, much like my first car, a `55 Chevy, offers a
choice for the consumer. They can either fix it themselves or then
can hire someone to fix it. That someone can be a representative of
the manufacturer or the kid down the street. This was certainly not
the case with proprietary operating systems or vehicles of the
1990s.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf61580.0x1059870"></a>How is <i  >Linux Journal</i> Doing?</h2></div></div><p>We are pleased to announce that as of November, 1999 90% of
our subscribers are now via the Internet rather than on paper. We
do, however, see that other 10% as so important because that is
where those who are new to computing (yes, there still are some)
find out about Linux and how easy it is to get their Linux system
on the Internet. Over the years, most of our subscribers have moved
from paper copies of <i  >LJ</i> to an Internet subscription once we got
them up to speed.</p><p>To make this electronic version possible we had to upgrade
our offices to a complete Linux network. Even though all of our
editorial and advertising work was done on Linux systems from our
humble beginnings in 1993, our production, subscription and
accounting systems ran on other computers. Today our seamless ISDN
connections (and the satellite link to my office outside of Yaak,
Montana) make this startup seem like a nightmare rather than the
reality of seven years ago.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf61580.0x1059a80"></a>What Else Make Linux a Success?</h2></div></div><p>These two events were a significant help in getting Linux on
its way.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>formation of MoAmI Semiconductor from Motorola, AMD
and Intel engineers in 1994. Linux was first operating system to
run on their 32-bit and 64-bit chips in native mode in 1996.</p></li><li><p>Linux became the most popular operating system used
in computer science classes in 1995. This meant that the pool of
available talent in the Linux market was huge.</p></li></ul></div><p>But we also need to consider the how events in the Unix
community helped Linux. When Novell decided to buy USL in 1993 it
was seen as a move to get their own product out there instead of
following each Microsoft move. As we now know, this worked and NT
(remember, it was going to take over the world) became the niche
operating system. Likewise, the decision of many fence-sitting
vendors to go with Linux gave it the needed push that caused it to
become a mainstream system.</p><p>This could be considered a political decision. Unix, although
open if you had an extra $100,000 for the purchase of source code
meant that its openness was restricted to existing companies.
Linux, with its $0 to get started characteristics made it possible
for creative talent to get into the computer business-much like in
the days of the Altair and the Apple II. The big difference is that
the hardware was generic and inexpensive in 1994 so the creative
work went into software.</p><p>This creativity made the larger vendors realize that they
needed to stick with hardware and support as profit centers. Going
to Linux as their operating system both reduced their software
development costs and made it easier for them to find pre-trained
systems programmers for the software work they still needed to
perform.</p><p>Is there one specific application that I see as making
everyone want a Linux-based computer system? Yes. I would say it is
the availability of telephone directory information on-line. The
fact that it is free and much easier to use than a traditional
phone book has caused more people to elect for an Internet
connection and Linux which offers a free reader for this
information that a 5-year-old can easily use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf61580.0x1059ea0"></a>What happened to those old Linux activists and
developers?</h2></div></div><p>Strange as it may seem, most are still writing code or books.
We don't see any who are CEOs or multi-billion dollar corporations.
There are successes and many who were involved in the early days of
Linux are making a very comfortable living but it seems that these
people chose a career path based on their interests rather than
attempting to become rich, famous or powerful.</p><p>Many of those who were minor players in Linux development or
just got involved because Linux was so popular in colleges are now
independent consultants. And they credit this happening with the
Linux philosophy. The fact that they could get source code and
learn about real software while in college gave them the necessary
skills to more directly into the work of their choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf61580.0x105a000"></a>What's Left to do?</h2></div></div><p>We need to offer Internet connectivity to everyone. In the
1930s we started a rural electrification project that was to bring
on-grid electricity to everyone in the United States. In the 1950s
television broadcasting was seen as a way to get information to
everyone. Both of these efforts had benefits but they also had an
associated cost. They encouraged people to go to their own separate
spaces, interact less with other people and passively
consumei&mdash;consume both products and consume information.</p><p>In 1990 people were much less likely to know the names of
their neighbors or world leaders than the names of fictitious
characters on TV shows. Although Internet connectivity may not help
people get to know their physical neighbors it does help them build
a community of electronic neighbors. Using the Internet is active,
not passive. Whether people elect to do research or electronically
talk to another person they are now making real choices and
possibly talking to real people.</p><p>Because Linux was so significant in getting tens of millions
of people connected to the Internet in the past five years and
Linux machines make up the majority of the machines connected to
the Internet today, I see this as a project that the Linux
community should take on. In 1993 and 1994 we were all out there
telling people about linux. If today we all walked next door,
introduced ourselves to those neighbors that have lived there since
1990 and then offered to help them get connected to the Internet we
could claim another huge victory for the Linux progressive movement
before year's end.</p><p>As always, send me e-mail at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> and tell me
what you think. And mention <i  >LJ</i> to your neighbor while your at
it.</p></div></div>
