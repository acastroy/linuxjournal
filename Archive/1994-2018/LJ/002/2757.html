    Running MX-DOS and MS-Windows applications under Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169f580.0x1797298"></a></h2></div></div><p>There are two Linux-related projects that
will be of particular interest to those who come from the more
traditional &ldquo;IBM Compatible&rdquo; circles. One of these projects is a
DOS emulator called DOSEMU. The other is an MS-Windows emulator
called Wine.
</p><p>The two projects are quite different from each other. DOSEMU
allows you to run a version of MS-DOS under Linux and then run your
DOS programs in that environment. Wine, on the other had, requires
no Microsoft code to allow you to run MS-Windows applications. It
does this by interfacing to your MS-Windows applications at the
Applications Program Interface (API) level. Wine then translates
these requests for a particular service to the equivalent X-Windows
function. We hope to have articles on bother projects in a future
issue of <i  >LJ</i>. For now, here is a status report
on the Wine Project.</p><p>Wine Status Report - January 26, 1994Thanks to the work of
Alexandre Julliard and Martin Ayotte, we have eliminated all Xt
code from Wine. Wine is now faster and looks more like MS
Windows.</p><p>We have a new mailing list!!! Hopefully, it will result in
faster turnaround times and less confusion.</p><p>We now have e30% of the major API functions defined. We have
received our first donations of money and equipment. We still could
use more, though. Our current plans are to use monetary donations
to buy programming time from student programmers. Work continues at
an amazingly rapid rate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169f580.0x1797558"></a>How Can You Help?</h2></div></div><p>If you are interested in contributing to this project, join
the wine-users mailing list. You can join by sending the
message:subscribe wine-usersto: wine-request@amscons.comTo send to
everyone on the list, send mail to wineusers@amscons.com. New
releases come approximately every Tuesday. All releases are
announced to the Wabi channel. Also, I will do my best to answer
any question mailed to me. However, we really need people who can
dedicate 10 or more hours per week. This project requires people
who can learn on their own. My address in bob@amscons.com.</p><p>If you don't have time to donate, how about money or
equipment? This project has exploded into one of great general
interest. We have attracted the attention of many individuals and
several prominent organizations. Monetary contributions will be
accepted to pay contributors for their time. Equipment is also
needed. Most notably, disk space is a big problem. If you would
like to make a contribution, please contact me by e-mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x169f580.0x17976b8"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>The Wine project is an attempt to write something with
similar functionality to the Wabi that was developed by Sun. The
basic goal is to be able to take an MS-Windows binary and run it
under X-Windows. Currently Wine is supported by two operating
systems, Linux and NetBSD. Other operating systems may be supported
in the future. The finished product will essentially consist of two
parts:</p><p>a) A program loader. This will load the Windows binary into
the virtual memory of the user process, provide a means for
adjusting the ldt of the processor so that the 16-bit segments
typically used with Windows binaries will work correctly, and
provide a means for calling the Windows binary in the first
place&mdash;allowing the Windows binary to call back to the 32-bit mode
program. This will allow the 32-bit mode program to call back again
to the Windows binary (i.e., Windows callbacks). In each case, the
arguments being passed will have to be pulled from the appropriate
stack and loaded on th the other stack (there will be a 16 bit and
a 32 bit stack).Finally some application specific DLL libraries
will have to be loaded, and dynamic linking will have to be
performed.</p><p>b) The second part of the finished product is an emulation
library, which takes calls to Windows functions and somehow
translates theses into calls to X11 in one fashion or another, so
that equivalent functionality is achieved.</p><p>It should be pointed out that the Windows binary will be
running directly&mdash;there will be no need for machine level emulation
of the instructions. Sun has reported better performance with their
version of Wabi than is actually achieved under
MS=Windows&mdash;theoretically, the same result is possible under
Wine.</p><p>The project got started as a result of discussions on
comp.os.linux in early June 1993. A mail channel was set up for
discussions, and this directory was created. At the moment, all the
files that are uploaded are in the private directory and then in a
hidden directory. The reason for this is that the program is really
useful only to developers right now. Once something is ready for
public consumption, it will be uploaded to a publicly visible
directory.</p></div></div>
