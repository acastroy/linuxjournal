Editor,</b></span>
</p><p>Thank you for e-mailing the <i  >Linux Journal</i> advertising rate
card. I am not interested in advertising in the <i  >Linux Journal</i>, for
the following two reasons.</p><p>1. I believe the free software &ldquo;formula&rdquo; (give away the
software, charge for services) only works if the software being
given away generates a demand for services - i.e., if it is buggy,
poorly documented, difficult to understand, hard to port, hard to
modify or extend, etc., etc. In my experience, Linux is at least
the first three of those things (details on request), but I believe
my own software (which is given away free with the Linux
distribution) is less so: In the last two years, since Ghost script
reached commercial quality, I have received almost no requests for
such services from the thousands of users on and off the Internet
who might have been expected to want them. A lot of people do post
questions and bug reports in the gnu.ghostscript.bug newsgroup, but
I don't particularly care to have my time nibbled to death
answering the same simple questions over and over again, even if
I'm being paid for it, so I usually respond to them by including
the answers in the documentation being prepared for the following
release. (Once a FAQ gets established, I expect the volume to drop
by about 80%.) And the news group also contains regular postings
from people who have written new drivers or have ported Ghostscript
to new environments with no help from me.</p><p>2. The people who embrace Linux are people who (a) don't have
much money, and (b) are willing to live with a system that, outside
its core functionality, is FAR below commercial quality. These are
not the people who are going to become substantial customers of my
business, which consists of licensing Ghostscript for commercial
use at market-rate prices.</p><p>&ldquo;I have gotten so frustrated I am now willing to switch to a
commercial system&rdquo;. I just don't want to put up with the loss of
time and productivity any longer. My one experience with
pay-for-service was a waste. It may, of course, turn out that the
commercial systems are no better; if so, I'll be coming back to
Linux.</p><p>I am sure the <i  >Linux Journal</i> will be valuable to people for
whom the savings in up-front cost is more important than having a
reliable, supported, productive system, but I don't count myself
among them.</p><p>Sincerely,L. Peter Deutsch,Aladdin Enterprises</p><p>Reply from the Editor:</p><p>I wrote an article on Unix on a PC that appeared in the
March, 1986, issue of Unix World and have used PC-based Unix
systems for almost ten years. Until last year when I decided to
&ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; some systems to Linux, my work was with products from
major commercial vendors. I have found Linux to generally be a
better operating system than those commercial products-better in
terms of reliability and support.</p><p>I don't want to go through a blow by blow description of the
problems I have had with commercial products, but let me say that
newer commercial products have had more bugs than the older ones.
In our office (where we run a network of Linux machines) we have
encountered one operating system problem that causes us to have to
reboot occasionally. This problem (a serial driver bug that causes
ports to hang) is fixed in the current Linux release but we haven't
upgraded yet. Note that this bug is virtually identical to a bug
that I have been dealing with for four years in a commercial Unix
system with a well-known intelligent communications board.</p><p>What's the difference? In the commercial system the vendors
(the operating system vendor and the communications board vendor)
both feel it is in their best interest to deny that a problem
exists. The result for me, the user, is that four years later I
still have to reboot the system about once a week. Because it is
clearly in the best interest of the Linux community to fix all
bugs, the existence of this problem was openly discussed and it was
fixed very quickly.</p><p>This is not to say that Linux is always better than an
alternative. But I don't think your experiences are typical of
those of most people in the Linux community. Many commercial
applications are getting ported to Linux with little or no
difficulty-substantially much less difficulty than people were used
to in porting to a system such as Xenix and generally much less
difficulty than porting to any commercial Unix system.</p><p>I also think you are off base with who the average Linux user
is. We see more and more people moving to Linux because it does the
job for them. Many of these people are coming from MS-DOS because
they need the multi-tasking capabilities and ability to seamlessly
address memory. Others are using Linux-based computers to replace
workstations and X-terminals.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>But I feel that once you get more experience with
the commercial alternatives to Linux and once Linux gets more
experience with commercial users, you will find it is a product
that has matured very
quickly.</em></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>Editor</em></span></p></div></div>
