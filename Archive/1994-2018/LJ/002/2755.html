    When people first start looking at Linux there are some
    hurdles. The first one is understanding that Linux is free.
    Because so much softwre is licensed, the idea that you can
    get a copy and legally give it to all your friends and use
    it on all your computers seems to take some getting used to.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b56240"></a></h2></div></div><p>When people first start looking at Linux there are some
hurdles. The first one is understanding that Linux is free. Because
so much software is licensed, the idea that you can get a copy and
legally give it to all your friends and use it on all your
computers seems to take some getting used to.</p><p>Once people get over that hurdle, the next problem seems to
be &ldquo;which distribution should I get?&rdquo;. This is because there isn't
just one Linux&mdash;a concept that is familiar to many Unix system
users but fairly foreign to the MS-DOS or MS-Windows user. This
article addresses that question. Hopefully the third question,
where do I get it, can be answered by our advertisers.</p><p>Historically, the word Linux had a somewhat different
meaning. It was really just the operating system kernel. People
would then collect various pieces of software (a compiler from one
place, login code from another and so on) and put together their
own system. The problem is that this took a lot of time, and as the
amount of support software available grew the choices grew as
well.</p><p>The solution was for someone to make a distribution, a
collection of software consisting of the kernel and all the support
programs that a user would need. What happened is that more than
one &ldquo;someone&rdquo; did this because of differing needs. And each of
these distributions was called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.</p><p>What's wrong with calling them Linux? Nothing, if we can
avoid the confusion that it initially introduces. The confusion
comes from two areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Different distributions contain different
programs.</p></li><li><p>Linux is really the kernel. When we lump all the
other programs in and still call the contents Linux we are ignoring
the work of others including FSF for the C compiler and most of the
utilities, and the University of California at Berkeley for Ingres
and Postgres.</p></li></ul></div><p>I am sure the label Linux will stick, but I do think it is
important that we recognize that there's a lot more to what we get
in a distribution than code written by those who would be
considered Linux developers.</p><p>Now, on to distributions. This isn't intended to be a
complete list, just a quick look for beginners. I encourage anyone
with a different distribution that they consider important to write
to us and tell us about it.</p><p>The first complete Linux distribution was SLS. Although the
most recent release is sorely out of date today, I mention it for
historical reasons. Many people who are using Linux started with
this distribution, which was produced by Peter MacDonald. It also
offered the basis for other distributions like Slackware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b56768"></a>MCC</h2></div></div><p>Developed at the University of Manchester, MCC was designed
to be quickly installed by anyone. It has excellent documentation
and is both compact and very stable. MCC was designed to be
installed on 386 systems in a lab used by computer science
students. It includes networking via ethernet and a complete
development system but lacks such things as print spooling, uucp
and X windows. Because of its excellent documentation and compact
size (easily fits in 30MB of hard disk space; distribution is 8
floppies) it is a great place to start-particularly if you have
little or no Unix experience.</p><p>At the time of this writing (February, 1994), the MCC
distribution is based on a rather old kernel. It is, however, very
stable and well tested.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b568c8"></a>Slackware</h2></div></div><p>Slackware evolved from the ideas behind SLS, a complete Linux
system with an installation system that makes it possible to pick
and choose what you want. It isn't perfect but it is very current,
well supported and very reliable. The imperfections are generally
in terms of a missing link or wrong permission. Here at <i  >Linux Journal</i> we have two systems running Slackware, and the only serious
problem we encountered was with smail. After talking to other Unix
users we determined that the problem was actually an smail bug, not
a Linux bug. We replaced smail with sendmail+IDA and all seems to
be fine now. Some distributors (such as Trans-Ameritech) are
distributing Slackware on CD-ROM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b56a28"></a>Yggdrasil</h2></div></div><p>Available only on CD-ROM, this is a very popular
distribution. Current and complete, it offers a quick way to get a
working system up and running. It includes X-windows (in fact, it
requires you to load X to do system configuration) and a pretty
amazing set of tools. Like most of the up-to-date distributions, it
has a few bugs. It is, however, a great choice for someone who
wants to get a working Linux system with X up and running quickly.
I also feel it is well worth the $50 for the amount of source code
you get in a compact form. We have one Linux system in the office
running Yggdrasil.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b56b30"></a>Debian</h2></div></div><p>This is a new distribution currently in beta test. I have not
run this but am on the developer's list. It seems to be progressing
rapidly toward a professional-quality distribution. It also appears
that Debian will be adopted as the official Linux distribution of
the Free Software Foundation. In structure Debian is much like
Slackware, but the level of effort going into it is going to make
it a very clean product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b56c38"></a>Linux/PRO</h2></div></div><p>This is a professional-quality Linux distribution. It is
currently being distributed in Holland with U.S. distribution
planned in the near future. Again, I have not worked with this
distribution, but it is being developed by a new company, ARIS, as
a commercial-quality product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a5e580.0x2b56d40"></a>Which one should you get?</h2></div></div><p>That depends on your needs and what equipment you have. If
you have a CD-ROM drive, buying Linux on a CD is a good choice. A
CD can hold over 600MB of files, and most of the CD distributions
have hundreds of megabytes on them. The low price tag (less than
$50) makes a CD an inexpensive way to get the information.</p><p>If you don't have a CD-ROM drive, but you do have Internet
access, downloading the files from one of the ftp sites is an
alternative.</p><p>If you don't have Internet access, try looking around on
local bulletin board systems. Hundreds of them offer Linux
distributions. Or contact your local Unix (or Linux) user's group.
Many of them know people who will make a copy of one of the
distributions for you if you supply the disks.</p><p>If all else fails, there are people who copy distributions to
floppy disks and sell them. Costs are generally around
$2/disk.</p><p>There is a manual called Linux Installation and Getting
Started, written by Matt Welsh, that I highly recommend (see the
review in <i  >LJ</i> #1, page 10). This runs about 200 pages and offers
answers to many of the common questions about getting your Linux
system up and running. It is available for ftp access on many of
the Internet sites that have Linux distributions. It's also
available on paper, comb bound from SSC.</p><p>In conclusion, if you have been thinking about Linux, take
the plunge. It works. It's a real operating system, useful both to
help you learn about Unix-like systems and to use for real
projects.</p></div></div>
