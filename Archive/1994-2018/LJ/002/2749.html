1994&mdash;The developers of XFree86, a free-software package developed
and distributed via the world-wide Internet, announce the formation
of The XFree86 Project, Inc., a not-for-profit corporation. Also
announced was the filing by the new corporation for membership in X
Consortium, Inc.
</p><p>&ldquo;This is an exciting day for all of us,&rdquo; said David E.
Wexelblat, President of the XFree86 Project, Inc. &ldquo;When we started
this free software project two years ago, we never imagined that it
would grow to this point. Our establishing this corporation and
joining X Consortium, Inc., helps give a voice to the entire free
software field, in a fast-growing area of largely-commercial
software development.&rdquo;</p><p>XFree86 is a package of enhancements to the X Window System,
Version 11, Release 5 (X11R5), for use on Intel[r]-based personal
computers running Unix and Unix-like operating systems. The X
Window System is a vendor-neutral, system-architecture neutral,
network-transparent windowing and user interface standard developed
by the X Consortium, Inc. XFree86 was initiated in April, 1992, by
David Wexelblat, David Dawes, Glenn Lai and Jim Tsillas, to enhance
the performance and reliability of X11R5 on the Unix-based personal
computers they were using at the time.</p><p>Since that time, there have been four major releases of
XFree86. The development team has grown to well over 100 developers
and testers, and the user community numbers in the 10's or 100's of
thousands. XFree86 is the sole implementation for several free-
software operating systems (such as Linux, Free BSD, and NetBSD)
currently gaining world-wide popularity. XFree86 is also shipped by
several commercial operating system vendors in place of, or
alongside of, a commercial implementation of The X Window
System.</p><p>&ldquo;...there is a choice,&rdquo; says Evan Leibovitch of Sound
Software Ltd., &ldquo;of either utilizing the X server offered with each
Unix (sometimes as an option), or springing for the
high-performance third-party servers for a little extra cash
(except, of course, for XFree86, which is certainly ready to take
its place with Kermit, TeX, gcc, Cnews, Linux and GNU Emacs as one
of the most significant freeware products of all time).&rdquo;</p><p>XFree86 supports over a dozen operating systems on
Intel-based hardware, including SVR4, UnixWare, SVR3.2, Linux,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mach, and OSF/1. More than 20 common SuperVGA
chipsets are supported as well as 6 of the most common video
accelerator chipsets including those from S3 and ATI. XFree86 is
available free of charge from free software repositories around the
world, via the world-wide Internet.</p><p>For more information about The XFree86 Project, Inc., or
