I believe the best and worst thing about Linux is its hard distinction
between <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel space</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>user
space</em></span>.
</p><p>
Without that distinction, Linux never would have become the most leveraged
operating system in the world. Today, Linux has the largest range of uses
for the largest number of users&mdash;most of whom have no idea they are
using Linux when they search for something on Google or poke at their
Android phones. Even Apple stuff wouldn't be what it is (for example,
using BSD in its computers) were it not for Linux's success.
</p><p>
Not caring about user space is a feature of Linux kernel
development, not a bug. As Linus put it on our 2003 Geek Cruise
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6427" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6427</a>), &ldquo;I only do kernel stuff...I
don't know what happens outside the kernel, and I don't much care. What
happens inside the kernel I care about.&rdquo;
After Andrew Morton gave me additional schooling on
the topic a couple years later on another Geek Cruise
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8664" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8664</a>), I wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Kernel space is
where the Linux species lives. User space is where Linux gets put to
use, along with a lot of other natural building materials. The division
between kernel space and user space is similar to the division between
natural materials and stuff humans make out of those materials.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
A natural outcome of this distinction, however, is for Linux folks to
stay relatively small as a community while the world outside depends
more on Linux every second. So, in hope that we can enlarge our number
a bit, I want to point us toward two new things. One is already hot,
and the other could be.
</p><p>
The first is blockchain
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_%28database%29</a>), made famous
as the distributed ledger used by Bitcoin, but useful for countless other
purposes as well. At the time of this writing, interest in blockchain is trending
toward the vertical (<a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=blockchain" target="_self">https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=blockchain</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12042f1.large.jpg"><img src="12042f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The second is <span   class="bold"><b>self-sovereign identity</b></span>. To
explain that, let me ask who and what you are.
</p><p>
If your answers come from your employer, your doctor, the Department
of Motor Vehicles, Facebook, Twitter or Google, they are each
<span   class="bold"><b>administrative identifiers</b></span>: entries in
namespaces each of those organizations control, entirely for their own
convenience. As Timothy Ruff of Evernym (<a href="http://evernym.com" target="_self">evernym.com</a>) explains,
&ldquo;You don't exist for them. Only your identifier does.&rdquo; It's the
dependent variable. The independent variable&mdash;the one controlling the
identifier&mdash;is the organization.
</p><p>
If your answer comes from your self, we have a wide-open area for a new
development category&mdash;one where, finally, we can be set fully free in
the connected world.
</p><p>
The first person to explain this, as far as I know, was Devon Loffreto
(<a href="https://twitter.com/nzn" target="_self">https://twitter.com/nzn</a>). He wrote &ldquo;What is 'Sovereign Source
Authority'?&rdquo; in February 2012, on his blog, The Moxy Tongue
(<a href="http://www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html" target="_self">www.moxytongue.com/2012/02/what-is-sovereign-source-authority.html</a>).
In &ldquo;Self-Sovereign Identity&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.moxytongue.com/2016/02/self-sovereign-identity.html" target="_self">www.moxytongue.com/2016/02/self-sovereign-identity.html</a>),
published in February 2016, he writes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Self-Sovereign Identity must emit directly from an individual human life, and not from
within an administrative mechanism...self-Sovereign Identity references every individual
human identity as the origin of source authority. A self-Sovereign identity produces an
administrative trail of data relations that begin and resolve to individual humans. Every
individual human may possess a self-Sovereign identity, and no person or abstraction of
any type created may alter this innate human Right. A self-Sovereign identity is the root
of all participation as a valued social being within human societies of any type.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
To put this in Linux terms, <span   class="emphasis"><em>only the individual has root for
his or her own source identity</em></span>.
In the physical world, this is a casual thing. For example, my own
portfolio of identifiers includes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
David Allen Searls, which my parents named me.
</p></li><li><p>
David Searls, the name I tend to use when I suspect official records are involved.
</p></li><li><p>
Dave, which is what most of my relatives and old friends call me.
</p></li><li><p>
Doc, which is what most people call me.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As the sovereign source authority over the use of those, I can jump from
one to another in different contexts and get along pretty well. But,
that's in the physical world. In the virtual one, it gets much more
complicated. In addition to all the above, I am @dsearls (my Twitter
handle) and dsearls (my handle in many other net-based services). I am
also burdened by having my ability to relate contained within hundreds
of different silos, each with their own logins and passwords.
</p><p>
You can get a sense of how bad this is by checking the list of logins
and passwords on your browser. On Firefox alone, I have hundreds
of them. Many are defunct (since my collection dates back to Netscape
days), but I would guess that I still have working logins to hundreds
of companies I need to deal with from time to time. For all of them,
I'm the dependent variable. It's not the other way around. Even the term
&ldquo;user&rdquo; testifies to the subordinate dependency that has become a
primary fact of life in the connected world.
</p><p>
Today, the only easy way to bridge namespaces is via the compromised
convenience of &ldquo;Log in with Facebook&rdquo; or &ldquo;Log in with Twitter&rdquo;. In both
of those cases, each of us is even less ourselves or in any kind of personal
control over how we are known (if we wish to be knowable at all) to
other entities in the connected world.
</p><p>
What we have needed from the start are personal systems for
instantiating our sovereign selves and choosing how to reveal
and protect ourselves when dealing with others in the connected
world. For lack of that ability, we are deep in a metastasized
mess that Shoshana Zuboff calls &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2" target="_self">www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshana-zuboff-secrets-of-surveillance-capitalism-14103616.html?printPagedArticle=true#pageIndex_2</a>),
which she says is:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...unimaginable outside the inscrutable high velocity
circuits of Google's digital universe, whose signature feature is the
Internet and its successors. While the world is riveted by the showdown
between Apple and the FBI, the real truth is that the surveillance
capabilities being developed by surveillance capitalists are the envy of
every state security agency.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then she asks, &ldquo;How can we protect ourselves
from its invasive power?&rdquo; 
</p><p>
I suggest self-sovereign identity. I believe
it is only there that we have both safety from unwelcome surveillance and
an Archimedean place to stand in the world. From that place, we can assert
full agency in our dealings with others in society, politics and business.
</p><p>
I came to this provisional conclusion during ID2020
(<a href="http://www.id2020.org" target="_self">www.id2020.org</a>), a gathering at the UN on May. It was
gratifying to see Devon Loffreto there, since he's the guy who got the
sovereign ball rolling in 2013. Here's what I wrote about it at the time
(<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2013/10/14/iiw-challenge-1-sovereign-identity-in-the-great-silo-forest" target="_self">blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2013/10/14/iiw-challenge-1-sovereign-identity-in-the-great-silo-forest</a>),

(<a href="http://irespond.com" target="_self">irespond.com</a>) and Respect Network (<a href="https://www.respectnetwork.com" target="_self">https://www.respectnetwork.com</a>) also was circulated
there, contrasting administrative identity (which it calls the &ldquo;current
model&rdquo;) with the
self-sovereign one. In it is the graphic shown in Figure 2.

The platform for this is Sovrin, explained as a &ldquo;Fully
open-source, attribute-based, sovereign identity graph platform
on an advanced, dedicated, permissioned, distributed ledger&rdquo;
(<a href="http://evernym.com/technology" target="_self">evernym.com/technology</a>). There's a white paper too: <a href="http://evernym.com/assets/doc/Identity-System-Essentials.pdf?v=167284fd65" target="_self">evernym.com/assets/doc/Identity-System-Essentials.pdf?v=167284fd65</a>.
The code is called plenum (<a href="https://github.com/evernym/plenum" target="_self">https://github.com/evernym/plenum</a>), and it's
at GitHub.
</p><p>
Here&mdash;and places like it&mdash;we can do for user space what we've done
for the last quarter century for kernel space.
