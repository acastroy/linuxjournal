Tibbo Technology's Tibbo Project System</h2></div></div><p>
The motto for the Tibbo Project System (TBS) is &ldquo;Take what you need. Leave
out what you don't.&rdquo; TPS, winner of a red dot Design Award, is Tibbo
Technology's highly configurable and affordable automation platform
featuring miniature blocks that implement specific I/O features. Need a certain
I/O function? Install the respective Tibbit. No use for something? Skip it.
Tibbo Technology argues that this module-based approach saves users money by
allowing precise definition of the features in automation controllers.
Tibbo's latest complement to TBS is a Linux-based Tibbo Project PCB (LTPP).
The new LTPP3 board runs Tibbo's own, highly polished and updated
distribution of Linux and is based on the powerful Texas Instruments 1GHz
Cortex-A8 Sitara CPU. What sets the LTPP3 apart from plain vanilla products,
such as Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone, is its mechanical and electrical
compatibility with Tibbo's Tibbit blocks and size-3 Tibbo Project Box
enclosures. Uses for the LTPP3 include running Embedded AggreGate, Node.js and
TiOS applications, not to mention use as a generic Linux board.

SourceClear Open</h2></div></div><p>
Open source and DevOps have been a boon to software development. Nevertheless,
sneaky hackers understand&mdash;and exploit&mdash;the fact that reusable code also
means reusable vulnerabilities to distribute throughout the global software
supply chain. To aid developers in navigating this new threat landscape,
SourceClear announced a new product, SourceClear Open, a cloud service that
tracks thousands of threat sources and analyzes millions of open-source library
releases. In explaining the need for SourceClear Open, the company notes that
developers are held increasingly accountable for security, which creates demand
for tools that help them with this responsibility. Unfortunately, traditional
security products are insufficient, and public and government-backed software
vulnerability databases have limitations. The SourceClear Open tool vaults
beyond these databases, enabling developers to identify what open-source
libraries they are using, what vulnerabilities exist, which vulnerabilities
actually matter, and what needs to be done to fix them. And, perhaps most
important, SourceClear Open integrates with the tools (GitHub and Jenkins)
and supports the languages (Java, Ruby, Python and JavaScript) upon which development
teams rely.

LiveCode Ltd.'s LiveCode</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Everyone Can Code&rdquo; is the vision that its maker has for LiveCode, a
highly productive coding environment for Linux, Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and
Server platforms. LiveCode Ltd. spent three years and weathered a $750,000
Kickstarter to enable a LiveCode rewrite from the ground up. The result is
LiveCode 8, which adds a new plug-in architecture that allows users to
drag/drop widgets containing sophisticated functionality. Widgets can be built
within the LiveCode platform and used to wrap functionality in external
libraries or each of the operating systems LiveCode supports. The new features
in LiveCode 8 are intended to empower a new audience of app makers. Some of
these include nine pre-made widgets, 46 new extensions, the all new LiveCode
Builder language, a 3.5x performance boost, Script Only stacks for better
version control and working in teams, LiveCode for HTML5 and a new Feature
Exchange for community funding of new features, among others.

Rogue Wave Software's Zend Server</h2></div></div><p>
The CTO at Rogue Wave Software, Zeev Suraski, says he's never seen anything
like PHP 7 in the software space&mdash;namely the halving of hardware needs after a
mostly painless software upgrade. Organizations salivating to leverage this
massive performance gain would be wise to investigate Zend Server 9, an
application server that builds on the benefits of PHP 7, both on-premises and
in the cloud. This new version of Zend Server also offers code tracing and
black box recording, making it an effortless process to perform root-cause
analysis. Another key feature is Z-Ray, a developer toolkit that accelerates
developer productivity by displaying all of the under-the-hood details of a
page request across all the PHP scripts involved in building a page. Finally,
with Zend Server 9, Rogue Wave introduces Zend Server Professional Plus and Zend
Server Enterprise Plus editions that offer customers expert support for the
open-source stack underlying the Zend Server-hosted PHP application.

Murat Yener and Onur Dundar's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Expert Android Studio</em></span> (Wrox)</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Expert Android Studio</em></span> is a new book for expert and experienced developers who
want to take their Android programming skills to the next level by unleashing
the potential of Android Studio. Authors Murat Yener and Onur Dundar, developers
at Intel and self-described open-source code geeks, have packed their new
Wrox-published book with best practices and advanced tips and techniques on
Android tools, the development cycle, continuous integration, release
management, testing and performance. After reading the book, developers will
push the boundaries of the Android platform with the developer tools. Besides
discovering the basics of working in Android Studio and Gradle, readers will
explore the application architecture of the latest Android platform; understand
the Native Development Kit; complete the development lifecycle with automated
tests, dependency management, continuous integration and release management;
write their own Gradle plugins to customize the build cycle and write plugins
to support development tasks.

SUSE LLC's SUSE Manager</h2></div></div><p>
SUSE Manager is a open-source IT management solution with a centralized console
for managing multiple Linux distributions, hardware platforms (x86, IBM Power
Systems and z Systems), as well as physical, virtual and cloud environments.
SUSE says that the solution helps customers reduce the complexities of managing
their IT infrastructures, a key advantage as customers look to cut costs and
increase the responsiveness required to adopt DevOps and hybrid cloud
solutions. The updated SUSE Manager 3 is now available, featuring Salt
automation software, improved configuration management, easier subscription
management and enhanced monitoring capabilities. Confronting the fact that
manually updating, patching and configuring servers can be difficult and time-consuming, SUSE Manager reduces costs with automated, centralized management of
Linux systems.

The Firebird Project's Firebird Relational Database</h2></div></div><p>
Firebird distills its identity into the phrase &ldquo;True universal open-source
database&rdquo; and boasts not only of being &ldquo;free like free beer&rdquo; but
also, fittingly, of being &ldquo;free like a bird&rdquo;. The latter permits anyone
to build a custom version of the Firebird, as long as the modifications are
made available for others to use and build upon. Technically speaking, Firebird
is a relational database offering many ANSI SQL standard features and runs on
Linux, Windows and various UNIX platforms. Firebird 3.0 is the latest major
release that succeeds most notably in unifying the server architecture and
improving support for SMP and multiple-core hardware platforms. Parallel gains
in 3.0 include an improvement in the threading of engine processes and the
options for sharing page cache across thread and connection boundaries, among
other improvements.
