Ever since I was a young boy, even before I thought of opening this
restaurant, I have wanted something like this. I remember watching
<span   class="emphasis"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></span>, listening to the voice
of HAL 9000 and thinking, &ldquo;That is what I need. A talking
computer.&rdquo; Years later, I suddenly realized that I still did not
have my talking computer. Well, today, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, we are going to change all that.
</p><p>What? Our guests have arrived? Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. I am so happy
you could come today. We have some wonderful items on our menu for
the programmer who has programmed everything. Please, sit and
Fran&ccedil;ois will bring you some wine. Fran&ccedil;ois, go to
the cellar and fetch the 1996 Hill of Grace from Australia.</p><p>Get comfortable, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. You are going
to love this wine. Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>merci</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois.
Please, pour for our guests.</p><p>I was telling Fran&ccedil;ois that we should have talking
computers everywhere by now, but my Linux workstation spends its
time in silence. For reasons that I cannot fathom, none of the
software on my system seemed to be speech-enabled. So, for all of
today's recipes, you will need a sound card in your system,
properly configured, as well as a microphone.</p><p>The Center for Speech Technology Research (CSTR) at the
University of Edinburgh in Scotland had just what I needed to start
down the road to my own talking computer. By surfing over to this
address,
<a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival" target="_self">http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/</a>,
you'll find a fascinating project called Festival.</p><p>Festival is a multilingual speech synthesis system. It is
capable of text-to-speech work with multiple voices. With its API
design, it can be incorporated into numerous other programs and
applications. You'll see what I mean as we explore this
package.</p><p>Getting Festival is easy. Visit the site, click the download
button and pick up the latest version of the package. While you are
there, pick up the <span   class="bold"><b>speech_tools</b></span>
package, as Festival relies on its presence. Consequently, it is
the first thing we will build:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf speech_tools-1.2.1.tar.gz
cd speech_tools
cp config/config-dist config/config
chmod +w config/config
</pre><p>At this point, you may want to consider whether you wish to
use shared libraries since the default is not to do so. In that
case, you must uncomment the following line in the config/config
file by removing the hash mark before the word &ldquo;SHARED&rdquo;:
<b  >#SHARED=1</b>.
</p><p>This is actually the recommended option now. Whether or not
you choose to do so, we can now continue with the build:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make info
make
make install
</pre><p>This is an excellent time to relax, try the foie gras (it is
really quite excellent, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?) and have another
sip of your wine. When the speech_tools are built, it is time to
create the Festival system. Unpack the source for Festival into a
directory of your choosing with the command <b  >tar -xzvf
festival-1.4.1.tar.gz</b>.
</p><p>All these files will expand into a directory called
/festival. Before you do anything else, unpack the language lexicon
and speech database. I started by grabbing the following
files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
festlex_CMU.tar.gz
festlex_POSLEX.tar.gz
festvox_kallpc16k.tar.gz
</pre><p>The CMU file is a dictionary file for all English voices,
while the POSLEX file contains speech parts also common for all
English speakers. Finally, we have a speech database for an
American-style voice, with 16k sampling. Different readers will no
doubt want different voices, whether it be male, female, British or
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>bien s&ucirc;r</em></span>) French. Details on what you
might need are available by looking at the README in the web site's
distribution directory.
</p><p>When you extract these files, they will also expand into the
same /festival directory. From here, the process is identical to
what we did for the speech_tools, right down to copying the config
file from config-dist, except, of course, that we copy it to the
/festival directory.</p><p>When this is all done, type <b  >bin/festival</b>
from the installation directory. You should see something like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bin/festival
Festival Speech Synthesis System 1.4.1:

For details type `(festival_warranty)'
festival&gt;
</pre><p>Are you ready to hear your computer speak? Well then, at the
festival&gt; prompt, type the following (the parenthesis and quotes
are important): <b  >(SayText "Frani&ccedil;ois. Vite. More
wine.")</b>.
</p><p>If everything went well, you should have heard the words
&ldquo;Fran&ccedil;ois. Vite. More wine&rdquo; come from the speakers. It is
a commanding voice, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? I like to play that
line because it unnerves my faithful waiter. Of course, since I am
using an English voice and database, the pronunciation is what you
might call interesting. Typing <b  >control-d</b> here
will let you exit the Festival command mode. You can also type
<b  >(quit)</b>. Once again, the brackets are important
here. Let's try something more interesting. By using the --tts
flag, we can specify the pathname to a text file and have Festival
read it for us. For instance, I have a cron job that changes the
message-of-the-day every night by running the fortune program. So,
to read the message-of-the-day, I could do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bin/festival --tts /etc/motd
</pre><p>If you leave off a filename, you can just start typing. When
you are done, you then press control-d to terminate the input, and
Festival will exit. Here's one other thing to try. Simply pipe the
output of a command to the Festival program. Want to hear a rather
interesting interpretation of the date? Try this, <b  >date |
bin/festival --tts</b>.
</p><p>You might also run the Fortune program for some synthesized
wisdom: <b  >/usr/games/fortune | bin/festival
--tts</b>.</p><p>Festival can also run as a server for other programs to pass
text information by running the program with the --server flag. As
an example, you might write an application that writes to the
Festival socket (by default, this runs on port 1314). Listing 1 is
a little Perl script I wrote just for this occasion. It is not
exciting, but you might consider it a starting point for your own
applications. Keep in mind that you may have to change the path to
your Perl executable in the first line.</p><p><a href="4723l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Writing to the Festival
Socket</a></p><p>A wonderful example of this idea is a program written by
Darxus called <span   class="bold"><b>speechd</b></span>. This
package implements a device file called /dev/speech to which you
can write any text you like. Redirect the output to this device,
and the Festival system (when running in server mode) will pick it
up and say it. This is also a Perl script and can be downloaded
from the Speech IO site,
<a href="http://www.SpeechIO.org" target="_self">http://www.SpeechIO.org/</a>.</p><p>Start by unpacking the distribution into a temporary
directory. Then, run the simple build that follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf speechd-0.54.tar.gz
cd speechd
make
make install
</pre><p>To run the program as a d&aelig;mon, simply type the path to
the command: <b  >/usr/local/bin/speechd</b>.
</p><p>Before I continue, I should tell you that I had some problems
here. My Red Hat system's /etc/hosts file had a localhost entry
that read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
127.0.0.1   localhost.localdomain  localhost
</pre><p>Yours may as well.
</p><p>To make things work properly, I had to change it so that the
two localhost definitions were switched like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain
</pre><p>If, by chance, the Festival server is not running, the
speechd will try to start it. Unfortunately, if you built Festival
from source, you may have to modify the speechd script to use the
full path to the executable. Another option is to copy the Festival
binaries to /usr/local/bin.
</p><p>So, what can you do with this? Well, using my original
fortune program example, I could simply redirect the output to
/dev/speech with the command <b  >/usr/games/fortune &gt;
/dev/speech</b>.</p><p>Implementing this into your scripts is extremely easy. Here
is another example. I could have a script that runs every few
minutes to check for new mail, count the number of messages and
tell me about it through the speech device. (Note that the single
quotes are actually back-ticks.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "You have `frm | wc -l` messages in your
mailbox" /dev/speech
</pre><p>Now that we have our Linux systems talking to us, it seems to
me only one thing is missing. We need to have our systems listen to
us and do as they are told, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? We need voice
recognition software. For that little bit of personalization, I
went to Daniel Kiecza's home page and picked up the source for the
latest <span   class="bold"><b>cvoicecontrol</b></span>, a nice
little package distributed under the GPL.
</p><p>With cvoicecontrol, we can start creating the fully automated
system of our dreams. Of course, this now means we should be
careful what we say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf cvoicecontrol-0.9alpha.tar.gz
cd cvoicecontrol-0.9alpha
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>The resultant files will appear in your /usr/local/bin
directory. There are three that you need to know about. One is the
cvoicecontrol program itself. Before you can start using it, you
need to calibrate your microphone and create model files. This is
done with the <span   class="bold"><b>microphone_config</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>model_editor</b></span> programs.
</p><p>Start with the microphone_config program and follow it
through the question and answer session. It is all nicely
menu-driven. Your default mixer and audio devices should be
automatically detected, so that part should already be filled in.
Mine showed up as /dev/mixer and /dev/dsp. The next step is to
adjust mixer levels, set up recording thresholds and create a
configuration file. Probably the toughest part of this whole step
is having to talk loud enough for the time it takes the program to
get its levels. I tell you right now, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, it is more difficult than it sounds. The default
location is $HOME/.cvoicecontrol/config.</p><p>Then comes the fun part. Start the model_editor. You will be
presented with a menu where you can load, edit, save or create a
new speaker model. Have a look at Figure 1 to see the program in
action.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4723f1.large.jpg"><img src="4723f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Adding a Command through the
<span  class="bold"><b>model_editor</b></span>
</p></div></div><p>The model is you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Since there
is nothing here yet, hit New Speaker Model, then choose Edit.
Another menu will appear where you can record words and specify the
events those sounds will generate. Everything here is a single
keystroke. Press &ldquo;a&rdquo; to add a new item. The item will show up in
the list as a generic item with no command specified. Now, press
Enter to edit the item, and change the label to something that
makes sense. For instance, I created one called &ldquo;Start Mozilla&rdquo;,
and I entered <b  >/usr/local/mozilla/mozilla &amp;</b>
for the Mozilla start command.</p><p>Notice that I put an ampersand at the end of the command to
put it into the background. I did that because I want to be able to
launch other voice commands after this one has started. Once you
have done this, you need to enter some samples of your voice. You
will need at least four samples. Speak your command clearly, wait
and add another sample. When you have the four, you can back out
(by pressing &ldquo;b&rdquo;) and save your speaker model. You may call it
whatever you like, just remember where you put it.</p><p>So, now we have our microphone configured and at least one
command associated with an equivalent voice command. By the way, to
start Mozilla, you could just as easily say &ldquo;browser&rdquo; as your
voice command, but it usually makes sense to use the command name,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? The only thing left to do is start
cvoicecontrol: <b  >cvoicecontrol
speakermodel.cvc</b>.</p><p>Since I saved my speaker model as chefmarcel.svc (the
extension is not necessary), I started the voice recognition
software by typing <b  >cvoicecontrol
chefmarcel.svc</b>.</p><p>Now, if I say the word &ldquo;Mozilla&rdquo;, the browser starts up. I
also created commands for my favorite editor,
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>, and, of course, a couple of
games.</p><p>Open the restaurant doors please, Tux. With tools such as the
ones on today's menu, you can be well on your way to owning the
computer of the future, today. You already run Linux, so you are
almost there.</p><p>Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, the clock, she is
telling me time is running out and we must soon close. No sense in
closing too soon, though. Fran&ccedil;ois, won't you please pour
our guests another glass of wine? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. You know, Fran&ccedil;ois, your
built-in voice recognition software is working very well. Of
course, Fran&ccedil;ois, I know you are a man and not a machine. Do
not look so hurt. It is only a little joke,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, I must thank you again for
coming. Until next time, please join us here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>. Your table will be waiting.</p><p>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="4723s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
