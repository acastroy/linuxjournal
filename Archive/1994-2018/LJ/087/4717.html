melting pot of cultures as well as a mix of users from super geek
to &lt;\#252&gt;ber-newbie. For each, I have something to chew on
this month. For the super geeks (code hackers, Linux wizards, etc.)
I suggest looking toward the lowest common denominator, which now
seems to be refugees looking for stability and useability. This
means not only making your programs as useable as possible (think
KISS, keep it stupid, simple), but also as available as possible.
What I'm talking about regarding availability is the judicial use
of libraries and Perl modules. I know some think GNOME is sexy, but
there's nothing sexy about a program that, while it really doesn't
need GNOME libs to run, won't compile without it. To the newbies, I
offer that you are not as useless to the Linux community as you
might think you are. If you can do nothing else, perhaps you can
translate documentation or proofread it, insert comments and
questions and send them either to the official mail list or to the
author. Programs require testing (and so, alpha and beta testers)
and documentation among other things. Help out the way you can.
Offer support. The more folks that do this, the more momentum open
source will achieve, and the better it will become.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13b9450"></a>dhcpstatus:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://dhcpstatus.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://dhcpstatus.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p><p>The only drawback I see for this utility is it requires a web
server on your DHCP system. You might want to find a smaller one
that will run Perl scripts (perhaps a small Perl web server&mdash;I'll
need to look for one of those). But
<span   class="bold"><b>dhcpstatus</b></span> shows at a glance
information that takes a few minutes to discern by looking or
grepping through the leases.dhcp file. Granted, you can also do
this with Webmin if you've chosen to install it, but sometimes
that's like using a supercomputer when
<span   class="bold"><b>xcalc</b></span> would do the job faster.
Requires: Perl, web server on the DHCP server system, web
browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13b96b8"></a>qleuren:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://qleuren.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://qleuren.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p><p>If you like MindMind, you'll like this particular game. While
not (yet) particularly customizable (you can't change things like
colors, number of colors, number of guesses, number of hidden
pieces) it's a good start. Just click on or drag-and-drop the
pieces. When you're ready, click on the box to the side and see how
you fared. It's been a while since I've played MasterMind, and it
showed on my first few tries. Requires: libqt2, libstdc++, libm,
libXext, libX11, libSM, libICE, libpng, libz, libjpeg, libmng,
glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13b9870"></a>pinfo:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~pborys" target="_self">http://zeus.polsl.gliwice.pl/~pborys/</a>
</p><p>If you're like me and despise the info pages (mostly for the
hateful <span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span> program I can't bend
to my will) but you like Lynx, then let me suggest you have
<span   class="bold"><b>pinfo</b></span> installed on all those
nongraphical systems (servers) out there. Yes, I know
<span   class="bold"><b>konquerer</b></span> will make short work of
info files (if you use KDE). Unfortunately, I always find the
systems for which I most need to access the info pages are those
not running an X server. While pinfo is extremely good for viewing
info pages, I still uninstall all info-related stuff. Yes, I know
info is GNU not UNIX, but I've never seen it on anything but UNIX
systems, and I still think the man pages are better. But until info
dies the horrid death it deserves, at least there's pinfo.
Requires: libreadline (optional), libncurses (optional),
glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13b9b30"></a>sylpheed:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://sylpheed.good-day.net" target="_self">http://sylpheed.good-day.net/</a>
</p><p>If you run X (I think most folks do), this is a mail client
you should look into. It looks like Netcape's Messenger but is a
lot lighter, quicker and less prone to crash. It also can be split
into multiple boxes and moved around the screen (or sent to
separate screens). This mobility can be convenient for seeing
what's coming in without keeping a large application open on the
screen. Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl,
libXext, libX11, libm, libgdk_imlib, libgthread (optional),
libpthread (optional), glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13b9ce8"></a>rymo:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://rymo.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://rymo.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p><p>This is a very nice utility that will allow you to view a
POP3 mailbox from a web browser. One of the nice things is that
<span   class="bold"><b>rymo</b></span> doesn't need to be on the
same server as your mail; you can reach out and access your mail
server across the network. While good, rymo still has some
drawbacks: by default, it only sees the first 20 unread messages on
your server that are unread. You also don't have access to mail
you've already seen. Good for checking mail quickly, but mail you
need time to think about before replying is a problem. Requires:
web server w/PHP (3 or 4), web browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13b9ef8"></a>squirrelmail:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.squirrelmail.org" target="_self">http://www.squirrelmail.org/</a>
</p><p>Yet another option if you're using an IMAP2 server instead of
a POP3 server for getting your mail (or you just want to use IMAP
instead of POP) is <span   class="bold"><b>squirrelmail</b></span>.
This application does not need to be on the system with your mail
server, but does require PHP4 (will not work with PHP3). The
application is a little more polished than rymo, more along the
lines of <span   class="bold"><b>neomail</b></span>. It has a large
number of options and settings for users. Requires: web server
w/PHP4, IMAP server, web browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13ba160"></a>checkport.pl:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://cheba.darktech.org" target="_self">http://cheba.darktech.org/</a>
</p><p>Want to check your Class C network to see if any systems are
binding a particular port? Running
<span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> to do this is an option but a
rather heavy-handed one. This short Perl script will quickly check
all systems for one specified port quickly, using very few system
resources. Just call the program with the port number followed by
the Class C address (substitute a * for the last octet). Requires:
Perl, Perl modules IO::Socket, Time::localtime.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12c1580.0x13ba370"></a>Nebula Freelancer:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://freelancer.nebula.nl" target="_self">http://freelancer.nebula.nl/</a>
</p><p>This project is a start on a system aimed principally at
contractors, freelancers or other organizations that have work
outsourced to them in the IT world. The web interface allows you to
track trouble tickets, projects, clients, contacts and hours
worked. It will also have facilities to generate reports and
invoices. Not everything is working yet, but the basic system is in
place. This is worth looking at if you do a lot of outside work.
Requires: web server w/Perl support, Perl, Perl modules: DBD,
MySQL, MySQL server.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
