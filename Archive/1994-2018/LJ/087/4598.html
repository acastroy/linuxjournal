    KDevelop provides a tool that combines the
    resources of contributors and existing open-source products.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29ab558"></a></h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Manufacturer: Open Source Contributors</p></li><li><p>URL:
<a href="http://www.kdevelop.org" target="_self">http://www.kdevelop.org/</a></p></li><li><p>Price: Free Download</p></li><li><p>Author: Petr Sorfa</p></li></ul></div><p>The one development tool that has been lacking in the Open
Source community is a professional-level IDE (integrated
development environment). KDevelop thankfully provides such a tool
that combines the resources of contributors and existing
open-source products. However, does KDevelop match the expectations
of a commercial IDE usually based on a non-UNIX platform?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29ab9d0"></a>What Is an IDE?</h2></div></div><p>An IDE is an environment, preferably graphical, that is used
for the creation, debugging and maintenance of programs. The three
core components of this environment are a programmer's editor that
is context-sensitive to the programming language, a GUI (graphical
user interface) builder that is used to construct the graphical
front end of the application and a debugger to detect bugs in the
code.</p><p>These are the basic requirements of an IDE. However, there
really needs to be more than these three components to make an IDE
a useful tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29abb30"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Because open-source programs tend to concentrate on
completing the task, rather than being user friendly, installation
sometimes tends to be difficult and frustrating, particularly
considering all the different versions of Linux and the constantly
changing libraries and tools.</p><p>The KDevelop RPM binary can be downloaded by either following
the links off KDevelop's web site or by using a site such as
<a href="http://www.rpmfind.net" target="_self">http://www.rpmfind.net/</a>
to locate it.</p><p>For this review, I installed a brand new Linux installation
and made sure it included every single package and feature that the
distribution allowed.</p><p>Alas, I ran into installation problems when I found certain
dependencies for various libraries that did not exist in my Linux
installation. A quick diversion to the Internet to download the
missing libraries solved the problem.</p><p>Total installation time took about 30 minutes with a fast
internet connection and a little bit of technical knowledge. This
installation method is ideal for users with some Linux
administration skills.</p><p>Sometimes, building from source is recommended for
programmers that have non-Linux/UNIX operating systems, for
customized Linux distributions and for potential KDevelop
contributors. Only experienced or very determined developers should
attempt building KDevelop from source code.</p><p>All the development versions of the required libraries must
be installed. Because there is no easy way of determining these
dependencies, building from source tends to be a process of trial
and error.</p><p>A feature of KDevelop is its ability to use many existing
open-source tools. Not all of these tools are required, but they
are necessary to ensure that KDevelop performs as expected. When
KDevelop is started for the very first time, a list of associated
tools are given and are marked as either present or missing (see
Figure 1). Once this list is available, the missing tools can be
installed later.</p><p>Required tools utilized by KDevelop are g++2.7.2, g++2.8.1 or
egcs 1.1 (I recommend g++2.9.2); make; perl 5.004; autoconf 2.12;
automake 1.2; flex 2.5.4; gettext; Qt 2.2.X (which includes Qt
designer and uic); and KDE 2.X.</p><p>Optional tools include enscript, Ghostview or KGhostview,
Glimpse 4.0, htdig, sgmltools 1.0, KDE-SDK (KDE software
development kit), KTranslator, KDbg, KIconedit and Qt Linguist.
Although optional, it is best that all of these tools are
available.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4598f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Initial KDevelop Startup Detecting Installed Tools
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29ac160"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>Although KDevelop provides the three core requirements of an
IDE (editor, GUI builder and debugger&mdash;see Figure 2), it has
several other features that make it a robust and reliable tool,
suitable even for commercial projects.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f2.large.jpg"><img src="4598f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. KDevelop 1.4 in Action</p></div></div>
</p><p>A complex program can be daunting for both beginners and
experts alike; so program documentation is critical. The
documentation for KDevelop provides a good source of on-line help,
although it does lack screenshots and visual content.
Context-sensitive help is available through tool tips and the
&ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; cursor mode.</p><p>KDevelop also indexes the KDE Lib and Qt documentation. The
ability to set bookmarks is present, which makes it easy to return
to relevant documentation. Other tutorials and documentation are
also available at the KDevelop's web site.</p><p>KDevelop has a built-in HTML browser that makes documentation
access effortless and removes the need for an external
browser.</p><p>Here are the basic interface components: Tree View, which
consists of a class, groups, file, books and watch views; Output
View, which provides output for messages, stdout, stderr, debugger
breakpoints, debugger frame stack, debugger disassembly and
debugger messages; Editor and Documentation, which includes
Header/Resources editor, C/C++ files editor and documentation
browser; and Tool Bar, an iconic representation of the main menu
options.</p><p>KDevelop's project creation process is one of the easiest to
execute using the Application Wizard, which goes through the
following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Application Type (see Figure 3)--this step allows
the user to select a template for creating a program using KDE 2
Mini; KDE 2 Normal; KDE 2 MDI GNOME (Normal); Qt (Normal, Qt 2.2
SDI, Qt 2.2 MDI, QextMDI); Terminal, i.e., text (C, C++); and
others (custom).</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4598f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Application Wizard
</p></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Generate Settings (see Figure 4)--this is the step
to enter the project name, location, initial version number,
author's name and e-mail. There are also options to generate
various project-associated files, such as sources, headers, GNU
standard files, icons and project-associated documentation.</p></li></ol></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f4.large.jpg"><img src="4598f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Entering the Project
Settings</p></div></div>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Version Control System (see Figure 5)--the version
control system dialog allows you to set the parameters of the
source control system. This is dependent on the Linux distribution.
In general, this is the CVS tool.</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f5.large.jpg"><img src="4598f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Selecting the Version Control System
</p></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Header Templates for header and code files (see
Figure 6)--this allows the developer to select automatically
generated headers for program headers and source files. These
headers are fully customizable with tag expansions, which fill in
various bits of information, such as the author, filename and
date.</p></li></ol></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f6.large.jpg"><img src="4598f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Header Template Setup for Header
Files</p></div></div>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Project Creation (see Figure 7)--in the final stage
of project creation, the related project's files and directories
are created, using the <span   class="bold"><b>automake</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span> tools. Note that if
some of the required tools are missing in the Linux distribution,
this creation process might fail. If failure does occur, it is best
to install the missing components and then recreate the project. It
is extremely difficult to recover from a project-creation
failure.</p></li></ol></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f7.large.jpg"><img src="4598f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Initial Project Creation</p></div></div>
</p><p>Once the project has been created, development can begin. I
strongly suggest that at this point the project be built and
executed to detect any build problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a3e90"></a>Qt Designer</h2></div></div><p>KDevelop 1.4 uses Trolltech's Qt Designer. Qt Designer
provides a professional interface, allows GUI building with most of
the Qt widgets and is a very useful tool for relating GUI widgets
and components with each other (best thought of as visual
programming).</p><p>Here is a synopsis of the process to create GUI components
with Qt Designer under KDevelop 1.4 (see Figure 8).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f8.large.jpg"><img src="4598f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 8. The KDevelop 1.4 GUI Builder, Trolltech's
Qt Designer</p></div></div>
</p><p>Qt Designer is a major product itself and requires a separate
article to fully describe its capabilities and usage. In this
article, its relevance to KDevelop will be covered.</p><p>Qt Designer allows the use of layout tools and access to all
widget properties. It has the ability to create relationships
between widgets, such as the click on a push button with the
closing of a window.</p><p>Qt Designer only generates an intermediate XML .ui file
describing the dialog. Another Qt utility,
<span   class="bold"><b>uic</b></span>, is used to generate the
actual source code files from the .ui file. KDevelop 1.4 supports
the .ui files, but the user needs to add the .ui file to the
project. When the user initiates a make or rebuild, KDevelop
automatically calls uic to generate the relevant associated
code.</p><p>Unfortunately, uic rewrites all the generated code files
whenever the user changes the .ui file with Qt Designer. This
implies that the user cannot edit these generated source files. To
use the code generated by the uic tool the user needs to inherit
the generated code classes before implementing the user-defined
functionality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a43b8"></a>Debugging</h2></div></div><p>KDevelop harnesses <span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> in
order to provide debugging facilities (see Figure 9). Clicking in
the left-hand column of the editing windows sets a breakpoint in
existing code. The breakpoints can even be set when the program is
not running or is in a noncompilable state, which are known as lazy
breakpoints. KDevelop displays lazy breakpoints in blue and active
breakpoints in red. A little green arrow next to the corresponding
line of source indicates the current point of execution.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f9.large.jpg"><img src="4598f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 9. Debugging the Project</p></div></div>
</p><p>KDevelop provides most of the required basic debugging
functionality, such as basic execution, next line and program
interruption. The user can activate a floating debugging toolbar
for easier debugging command access (see Figure 10). In the tree
views, the variable tree tab displays the currently available
variables.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4598f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The Floating Debugger Toolbar
</p></div></div><p>Debugger-related information is displayed in the debugger,
assembly, frame stack and breakpoint output windows.</p><p>The problem with the default debugger support is that users
wishing to do finer-level debugging cannot access gdb directly.
Another problem is that the user can alter variable values only in
a non-intuitive way via the Watch input line. However, KDevelop can
be configured to use an external debugger, such as the ever-popular
<span   class="bold"><b>DDD</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>kdbg</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xxgdb</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a4af0"></a>External Applications</h2></div></div><p>KDevelop allows the executions of KDE applications within its
framework. Applications such as the
<span   class="bold"><b>GIMP</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Ark</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>KBabel</b></span> are set up by default.
Users can add their own via the options-&gt;tools menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a4d00"></a>Compiling, Building and Distribution</h2></div></div><p>Compilation and building of the project can be done through
various menu options, such as make, clean, rebuild, clean for
distribution and auto configuration. KDevelop is intelligent and
will prompt you, if necessary, to rebuild the project before
program execution.</p><p>The Project-&gt;Make Distribution-&gt;Source.tgz menu item
allows the creation of the source for distribution. Unfortunately,
there does not seem to be a way of automatically generating RPMs or
RPM spec files for more useful packaging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a4e60"></a>Configuration Management (Source
Control)</h2></div></div><p>If version control system was chosen during the project's
creation, designated files can be added to source control system
(see Figure 11). This can be done by selecting the file's Add to
Repository pop-up menu option in the Group or File view. Changes
can be committed via the Commit option and other developer changes
retrieved with the Update option.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4598f11.large.jpg"><img src="4598f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 11. Using the Source Control
System</p></div></div>
</p><p>Because CVS supports remote repositories, it is possible to
have multiple developer projects using KDevelop. However, KDevelop
does not provide the full functionality associated with CVS, such
as file watching and editing privileges.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a51d0"></a>User Generated Documentation</h2></div></div><p>KDevelop has hooks for generating program API documentation
via <span   class="bold"><b>kdoc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>doxygen</b></span>. When generated, the user
can browse the user API documentation with KDevelop. This is very
handy for large projects with several developers.</p><p>If user documentation was selected during the creation of the
project, a user manual HTML template is automatically generated. It
is up to the user whether to use an HTML editor to fill out this
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a53e0"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>One of the possible disadvantages of open-source projects is
support. Occasionally a project goes into hiatus, and it might be
virtually impossible to contact someone concerning problems, help
or bugs. However, KDevelop has a very active mailing list, which is
continually monitored by the several maintainers of KDevelop.
KDevelop itself provides a bug-reporting tool that allows users to
send problem descriptions to the KDevelop folks.</p><p>Therefore, support is not a problem, and coupled with a good
range of on-line documents, KDevelop provides a level of support
that most commercial products cannot match.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x29a5540"></a>What Is Missing Wish List</h2></div></div><p>Although KDevelop is a robust and useful tool, several
functional areas are missing or still need to be improved:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A smart editor would be handy that would
automatically complete your code, like the parameters for the
current function.</p></li><li><p>KDevelop 1.4 language support is limited mainly to
C++ and C applications using the gcc/g++ compiler.</p></li><li><p>There could be better support for integrating with
other GUI builders, such as the GNOME GUI builder,
<span   class="bold"><b>glade</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Incorporating an existing project into KDevelop is
not easy.</p></li><li><p>Rapid application development (RAD) components that
provide database connectivity and a base for enterprise level
development are not present.</p></li></ul></div><p>Because KDevelop is an open-source program, these missing or
incomplete features may not be such problems after all. The
KDevelop team is continually striving to improve the IDE, and if a
feature is really wanted, implement it yourself and be part of the
KDevelop team.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b3580.0x2cb9060"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>KDevelop has the capabilities equivalent to an intermediate
level commercial IDE. It integrates well with the Linux platform,
makes use of many open-source tools and provides a level of support
that is hard to beat. Although there is still room for improvement,
KDevelop fulfills the functions of a development environment
suitable for small to intermediate projects and development
teams.</p></div></div>
