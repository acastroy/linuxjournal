    Embedded Linux has really arrived!
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf95580.0x108d608"></a></h2></div></div><p> In my writings about past embedded
systems conferences, I've characterized the impact of Linux on the
embedded market as a &ldquo;disruptive technology&rdquo; that was rewriting
the rules of the game. Not any more&mdash;the disruption now appears to
be complete!
</p><p>Not that this was a big surprise, for a recently released
subscriber survey conducted by <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Systems
Programming</em></span> magazine already exposed embedded Linux as
the number two embedded OS in terms of &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; for new
designs and number four in terms of actual usage.</p><p>The &ldquo;big three&rdquo; embedded OSes are, at the moment: 1)
VxWorks, 2) Embedded Linux and 3) Windows Embedded&mdash;or 1) VxWorks,
2) Windows Embedded and 3) Embedded Linux&mdash;depending on how you
count. These days, I doubt if you can find an embedded software or
hardware vendor that doesn't attribute &ldquo;must-support&rdquo; status to
Linux, or a developer who doesn't feel compelled to investigate
Linux as an embedded OS option in the course of a new product
development cycle.</p><p>In fact, last week's <span   class="emphasis"><em>ESC Official Show
Guide</em></span> had, for the first time, an entire product
category devoted specifically to &ldquo;Embedded Linux&rdquo; (there wasn't
one for Windows Embedded or VxWorks, by the way). That category
included 40 companies who weren't, by any means, all the companies
at the conference that showed or promoted embedded Linux-oriented
products. And, that doesn't include seven companies that exhibited
in the Embedded Linux Consortium's &ldquo;Pavilion 101&rdquo;: RidgeRun,
Tuxia, FS FORTH-SYSTEME, <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>, Trolltech, PalmPalm and Wipro who were not
allowed to have their own company listings in the show
guide.</p><p>So that's the good news. The bad news, on the other hand, is
that it's no longer feasible for me to cover &ldquo;all things Linux&rdquo;
in my customary review of Linux at the Embedded Systems Conference.
My sincere apologies, in advance, to all those companies and
products that have not been included!</p><p>Most of the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; (if 12-18 months qualifies as
&ldquo;traditional&rdquo;) embedded and real-time Linux players were present,
plus a few newcomers. These included distribution providers, tools
vendors, purveyors of middleware (browsers, GUIs, protocol stacks,
etc.), chip makers and board/system manufacturers. Following is a
rundown on some of the many embedded Linux-related products and
demos that I found at ESC.</p><p>Altera announced availability of an enhanced Nios soft
processor core that will enable Ethernet/internet connectivity and
will be well supported by embedded Linux through a strategic
relationship with Microtronix.</p><p>Applied Data Systems (ADS) had their usual highly integrated,
graphics-oriented, StrongARM-based single-board computers, such as
the Graphics Master and Bitsy, running embedded Linux along with
Century Software's Microwindows.</p><p>Century Software occupied a prominent position in Red Hat's
large booth, where they showed several demonstrations of their well
known Microwindows GUI/windowing environment for embedded devices
and handheld computers. While there, I stumbled upon a preliminary
data sheet for a new and not-yet-announced product called WebMedia,
described as: &ldquo;a collection of development tools, SDKs, runtime
utilities (including embedded browser and specialized plugins), and
applications that work together to form a very powerful,
interactive, user interface framework...for settop boxes and web
tablets.&rdquo;</p><p>Grammar Engine announced that the next version of the PromICE
memory emulator debugging tool is going to be based on NetSilicon's
NET+ARM system-on-chip processor running uClinux Embedded Linux. As
a result, open-source firmware residing in the tool will be
available for modification and customization by the developers who
use it.</p><p>Green Hills demonstrated a prototype of their &ldquo;Multi&rdquo;
debugger running embedded Linux on a PowerPC target processor.
Green Hills expects to release this support sometime this summer,
for x86 and PowerPC targets.</p><p>Insignia demonstrated their newly announced Jeode platform
for embedded Linux-based devices, a PersonalJava compatible
implementation that includes Java-AWT compatible graphics.
Currently, the AWT support requires a full X Window System, but
small alternatives such as Tiny-X and Micro-X will be investigated
soon.</p><p>Lineo was spread around in four different booths. Among other
things, they demonstrated their newly announced Board Development
Kits (BDKs), for third-party single-board computers and
microprocessor reference platforms, and showcased their &ldquo;board
farm&rdquo;, which allows web-based access by developers to shared
development platforms in Lineo's labs. A demonstration of the
Embedix &ldquo;Target Wizard&rdquo; showed how easy it is to configure a
highly customized, minimum footprint embedded Linux system. Lineo's
recently acquired Convergence Integrated Media showed off their
&ldquo;Linux TV&rdquo;, an open solution for digital TV. Lineo announced the
opening of a new &ldquo;embedded systems center&rdquo; in Silicon Valley,
availability of a new timing and schedulability tool for Embedix
from Tri-Pacific Software, a Metrowerks CodeWarrior Development
System for Embedix on the Motorola PowerQUICC II MPC8260 and an
expanded partnership with Trolltech centered around Qt/Embedded
support for Embedix. Lineo also had several science fair-like
demonstrations including a laser modem and an RTAI-based software
radio (see photo).</p><p>LynuxWorks announced BlueCat Linux 3.1, which adds support
for MIPS R3000 and R4000 processors. With this release, LynuxWorks
now claims to offer &ldquo;the broadest microprocessor support for
embedded Linux&rdquo;. Also announced was Metrowerks' CodeWarrior IDE
support for BlueCat Linux system development on Linux and Solaris
hosts and the integration of Qt/Embedded into BlueCat Linux.</p><p>Microtronix showed off their newly announced Linux
Development Kit for Altera's Nios core, which will be added to
Altera's Nios Development Kit, an FPGA development platform that
uses the Nios soft core embedded processor. In support of this
effort, Microtronix ported uClinux to the Nios processor.</p><p>MontaVista unveiled Hard Hat Linux Version 2.0, which now
includes a menu-based system builder tool (called a Target
Configuration Tool), a utility to shrink shared libraries by
eliminating unnecessary code and symbols and introduces embedded
Linux support for Hitachi SH-3 and SH-4 microprocessors. MontaVista
also announced they are releasing their CompactPCI hot swap
technology source code to the Open Source community and declared
their intention to integrate Trolltech's Qt/Embedded with Hard Hat
Linux. Their many interesting demonstrations of Hard Hat Linux
(HHL) included ones showing: HHL high availability; HHL cross
development using multiple targets (PowerPC, x86, StrongARM,
XScale, MIPS and SH) and graphical IDEs, debuggers and performance
analysis tools; HHL along with IBM's VAME Java VM used as the basis
of an automobile console; an iPAQ PDA running HHL with a
Qt/Embedded-based GUI; and HHL running on reference boards for
Intel's XScale processor, Alchemy's Au1000 system-on-chip and
Hitachi's SH-4.</p><p>OnCore demonstrated Linux for Real-Time and the OnCore OS,
which provides the capability to run multiple OSes (including one
or more copies of Linux) simultaneously on a single computer
system. OnCore showed off their recently announced ability to
emulate Wind River's VxWorks (and run VxWorks applications without
modification) as one of the hosted OSes and demonstrated operation
of their OS on the IBM PowerPC 405GP.</p><p>PalmPalm demonstrated their Tynux Embedded Linux in a number
of gadgets including an iPAQ, a cell phone/PDA and a PDA/cell
phone. The latter two are covered briefly below in the section on
demos (including photos).</p><p>Rappore demonstrated their recently announced Bluetooth stack
for embedded Linux-based devices. They are developing a
sockets-based wireless API that supports the intermixing of both
802.11 and Bluetooth connectivity so that multiple devices can
communicate freely in a mixed-technology environment, without
regard to standard.</p><p>Red Hat had two interesting customer applications, an Intel
Residential Router appliance and a special-purpose wireless PDA
made by Symbol Technologies for Sun Microsystems field
personnel.</p><p>RedSonic gave demonstrations of their RED-Builder software
package, an easy-to-use system image creation and deployment tool
for embedded developers and showcased their real-time monitoring,
diagnostic and QoS system administration technology.</p><p>RidgeRun showed off their latest version of DSPLinux, which
now includes a nifty Appliance Simulator that helps developers
emulate the finished product (&ldquo;all the way down to the Linux
framebuffer&rdquo;), so they can begin developing and debugging their
software long before first hardware prototypes become
available.</p><p>TimeSys announced that they will deliver a complete Reference
Implementation of the Real-Time Specification for Java (JSR-00001)
to the Expert Group of the Java Community Process (JCP) on April
30th, 2001 for its evaluation.</p><p>Trolltech showed off their Qt/Embedded-based Qt Palmtop
Environment (QPE) running on the Compaq iPAQ PDA and announced
strong partnerships with three leading suppliers of embedded Linux
distributions (Lineo, LynuxWorks and MontaVista).</p><p>Tuxia held a press conference to announce the US launch of
their TASTE Embedded Linux operating system, which specializes in
internet appliance and thin client applications. TASTE is based on
Linux kernel 2.4 and a Mozilla browser, plus middleware and a full
complement of plugins and other enhancements including
&ldquo;crash-proof&rdquo; features.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4730f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
