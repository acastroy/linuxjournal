    Linux goes to the movies.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b3580.0x1aab768"></a></h2></div></div><p>This month we're taking a break from
installing Linux video software to report on the cool Linux video
applications shown at the National Association of Broadcasters
(NAB) convention in Las Vegas, April 21-26, 2001. Every April,
television chief engineers, station managers and everyone else with
an interest in professional video gear make the trek to Las Vegas
for the NAB. With more than 115,000 attendees and 1,700 exhibits,
NAB is one of the largest tradeshows in the world. Computer
enthusiasts may be more familiar with CES (122,000 attendees and
1,000 exhibitors) and COMDEX (225,000 attendees and 2,300
exhibitors). By acreage all three shows are about the same size: a
million square feet. Bring your hiking boots.
</p><p>At NAB Linux was a much bigger presence than last year.
Special effects offerings included RAYZ from Silicon Grail, Shake
from Nothing Real and Maya from Alias|Wavefront. Linux Media Arts
showcased the Cinelerra Quicktime video editor and the Kino DV
editor. AMD briefed video developers on getting the most from
Athlon. BOXX Technologies offered the <span   class="emphasis"><em>3D</em></span>BOXX
Graphics workstation. Video board makers presented Hauppauge and
DVS. For Linux settop boxes, ATI, OpenTV and Phillips TiVo were
there. Khronos and ProMpeg Forum each made announcements of
significant Linux media APIs. And, at the NAB conference, there was
a presentation on Linux and MP3 by Radio Free Asia.</p><p>&ldquo;The vast majority of high-end production shops will convert
to Linux in the next eighteen months&rdquo;, says Ray Feeney, a
four-time Academy Award-winner for Scientific and Engineering
Achievement and the technical chair of the Visual Effects Society
(<a href="http://www.visual-effects-society.org" target="_self">http://www.visual-effects-society.org/</a>).
VES participants include special effects artists from ILM,
DreamWorks, Pixar, PDI, Disney's The Secret Lab and Sony. VES
members are discussing how to transition the industry to Linux. For
years SGI IRIX was the OS of choice for studio film projects, and
many haven't been satisfied with the support they have received
since switching to Windows. Because Linux is open source, it is an
OS for which the industry can develop motion picture features, and
its ubiquity makes it much easier to find users more familiar with
it than with IRIX.</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody is buying anything now&rdquo;, said Feeney at NAB, &ldquo;but
once the writers' strike situation is over there will be
restructuring. Today when people have rendering requirements they
are going to Linux. The rendering side is solved and turnkey.&rdquo;
Feeney compares the state of the art in Linux graphics workstations
to where Linux servers were two years ago when first used in a
major production, for rendering <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>. He
expects Linux will dominate in two years on graphics workstations,
not just servers. ILM has already begun using Linux for
workstations as well as rendering.</p><p>Feeney is also the founder of Silicon Grail, a company
showing their next generation compositing tool RAYZ in the Compaq
booth at NAB. Designed for creating feature film effects, RAYZ runs
on Linux, IRIX and Windows. Production that originated on film is
first digitized by a film scanner such as the Kodak Cineon.
Although each frame may be stored as a separate image file (e.g.,
in Targa format), to the RAYZ operator it still looks like a movie.
Effects filters are diagramed left-to-right in the graph window for
ease of manipulation, and the effects results are visible in the
video playback window. Completed movies may be transferred back to
film or to video tape.</p><p>RAYZ is Silicon Grail's next generation interactive
compositor based on their Chalice software. Chalice was used on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Deep Blue Sea</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Prince of
Egypt</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek: Insurrection</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fantasia 2000</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Men in Black</em></span> and many other motion pictures.
It provides effects and color correction tools. For a typical
configuration RAYZ is expected to cost $9,900. RAYZ was in public
beta at the time of NAB, for release in May (see
<a href="http://www.silicongrail.com" target="_self">http://www.silicongrail.com/</a>).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4743f1.large.jpg"><img src="4743f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Maya Linux Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Maya from SGI company Alias|Wavefront is a widely used
professional 3-D animation and visual effects package. At NAB,
Alias|Wavefront announced Maya 4, with enhancements and
optimizations in the areas of rendering, character animation, brush
and paint tools, and games-related functionality. Enhancements to
the Maya non-linear motion editing technology include time warping,
character merging, drag and drop, and character set editing. New
character animation features include switching between forward
kinematics and inversion kinematics, quaternion-based IK, motion
trails, ghosting and a jiggle deformer to wobble character
muscles.</p><p>&ldquo;Customer demand for a Linux version of Maya has driven this
development&rdquo;, says Alias|Wavefront entertainment business general
manager Bob Bennett. That decision was influenced by feedback from
the Technical Committee of the Visual Effects Society. Linus
Torvalds called Maya 3 &ldquo;the most complex and powerful 3-D graphics
application ever to run on Linux&rdquo; when the Linux port was
announced in the summer of 2000.</p><p>Maya was used by ILM for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Perfect
Storm</em></span>, by The Secret Lab for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mission to
Mars</em></span>, by Sony Pictures Imageworks for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Hollow Man</em></span> and by many other productions.
Alias|Wavefront demonstrated Maya 4 for IRIX and Windows at NAB,
due for release the end of June. The Linux version is expected six
to eight weeks later. Prices start at $7,500 (see
<a href="http://www.aliaswavefront.com" target="_self">http://www.aliaswavefront.com/</a>).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4743f2.large.jpg"><img src="4743f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Shake 2.4 Linux Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>Shake from Nothing Real (Venice, California) is high-speed
compositing software optimized for visual effects for feature
films. New features in Shake 2.4 include vector-based procedural
paint, advanced color correction tools, a new rotoscoping node and
ease-of-use improvements. It is resolution independent and
automatically handles different bit-depths (8, 16, 32) and
resolutions (Web, 601, HDTV, film, IMAX).</p><p>Shake has been used in over 60 feature films, and since its
debut, has been used in every Oscar winner for visual effects
including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>What Dreams May
Come</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gladiator</em></span>. Shake runs on Linux, IRIX and
Windows. Shake 2.4 entered beta testing in February and is
scheduled for release shortly after the NAB. Prices start at $9,900
(see
<a href="http://www.nothingreal.com" target="_self">http://www.nothingreal.com/</a>).</p><p>Linux Media Arts (Burbank, California) creates turnkey video
editing and media-streaming systems for video, film, audio and the
Internet. LMA president Mike Collins says, &ldquo;Our goal is to make
Linux the premier multimedia editing and media production platform
in the world, largely using open-source software.&rdquo; To that end
Collins says their mission right now is to create servers and
editors for a new high-quality SDDI board they announced at NAB.
Until now they have been offering M-JPEG and DV systems.</p><p>At NAB LMA demonstrated their DV and Quicktime-based editing
systems. Bundled software includes Cinelerra and Kino video
editors, Blender 3D, the GIMP, Corel Draw and Red Hat Linux.
Systems are based on AMD, Intel and Compaq Alpha chips. Prices
start at $1,395 with an AMD 1GHz processor (see
<a href="http://www.linuxmediaarts.com" target="_self">http://www.linuxmediaarts.com/</a>).</p><p>Kino is a simple cuts-only DV video editor. DV is the format
used by most consumer digital camcorders. Author Arne Schirmacher
in Germany says, &ldquo;Kino allows you to record, create, save, edit
and play movies recorded with DV camcorders. Although it has
windows and menus, it is actually a keyboard-driven program. It
uses many keyboard commands that are similar to the vi text
editor.&rdquo; (See
<a href="http://www.schirmacher.de/arne/kino/0" target="_self">www.schirmacher.de/arne/kino/0</a>).</p><p>At NAB Jason Howard of LMA demonstrated Kino 0.4 as part of a
suite of tools for DV to DVD production. Howard is the developer of
<span   class="bold"><b>dvcont</b></span>, a DV camera-control
utility. Other open-source DV utilities include
<span   class="bold"><b>dvgrab</b></span> (also by Schirmacher) and
<span   class="bold"><b>dvsend</b></span>. The dvgrab utility moves
footage from the camera to the computer using the 1394 protocol.
The dvsend utility moves edited material back onto camcorder video
tape.</p><p>Howard is also a partner in the video production company
Spectsoft (Oakdale, California). Currently a mixed Windows/Linux
facility, partner Ramona Howard (Jason Howard's mom) is keen to
move entirely to Linux in order to have increased control over the
production process. As a video producer she encourages Jason to
develop more open-source software. Jason Howard says, &ldquo;All it
takes is one person to have a passion in Linux. That's all of us,
and a lot of soda!&rdquo;</p><p>Howard is currently working on a transcoder utility to move
footage between AVI and Quicktime to enable transferring material
easily between Kino and Cinelerra. He is also working on
selectively grabbing DV camera footage based on an edit decision
list (see
<a href="http://www.spectsoft.com" target="_self">http://www.spectsoft.com/</a>).</p><p>Cinelerra is a Quicktime-based video editor from Heroine
Virtual. They are well known in the Linux community for their
Broadcast 2000 editor (see &ldquo;Moviemaking in a Linux Box?&rdquo; January
2001) and XMovie player. Cinelerra was announced and shown at NAB.
It is a resolution-independent editor with over 100 real-time video
and audio filters, has support for five-channel audio and is
designed to run on multiprocessor hardware. Heroine Virtual bundles
its software with systems manufactured by Linux Media Arts (see
<a href="http://heroines.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://heroines.sourceforge.net/</a>).</p><p>Chipmaker AMD (Sunnyvale, California) briefed video
developers at NAB on how to take advantage of processor advances in
their Athlon and Duron chips. Audio/video development engineer Jim
Bovenzi says, &ldquo;Dual processor solutions are key to maximizing
performance in video applications. Dual Athlons provide incredible
performance.&rdquo; AMD demonstrated the OnAir DTV 1080i HDTV card from
Sasem running on Windows XP (see
<a href="http://www.amd.com" target="_self">http://www.amd.com/</a> and
<a href="http://www.sasem.com" target="_self">www.sasem.com</a>).</p><p>WinTV-HD is an HDTV card offered by Hauppauge (Hauppauge, New
York). The Hauppauge WinTV card is very popular among Linux users.
Unfortunately, according to a Hauppauge engineer the WinTV-HD
architecture is quite different. The Linux community faces another
reverse engineering job to support the WinTV-HD card shown at NAB.
Hauppauge has no plans for Linux support. The WinTV-HD card costs
$399 (see
<a href="http://www.hauppauge.com" target="_self">http://www.hauppauge.com/</a>).
Another Windows consumer HDTV card at NAB was accessDTV for $479
(see
<a href="http://www.accessdtv.com" target="_self">http://www.accessdtv.com/</a>).</p><p>The HDStationOEM is an uncompressed HDTV real-time I/O card
for professional applications. Maker DVS Digital Video (Glendale,
California) says they offer Linux drivers. However, the $40,000
price tag puts it squarely in the pro market. In supports 1080p and
even 2k film resolution (see
<a href="http://www.digitalvideosystems.com" target="_self">http://www.digitalvideosystems.com/</a>).</p><p>The Linux-powered TiVo settop box sold by Phillips was on
display, as was a new settop from ATI Technologies (Ontario,
Canada) based on their ALL-IN-WONDER. An engineering model running
on a Linux PC was in their booth. ATI offers Linux drivers for
their new Fire GL4 high-end graphics card that's $1,995. Settop
developer OpenTV (Mountain View, California) announced their
intention to support Linux (see
<a href="http://www.tivo.com" target="_self">www.tivo.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.ati.com" target="_self">www.ati.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.opentv.com" target="_self">www.opentv.com/</a>).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4743f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span  class="emphasis"><em>3D</em></span></p></div></div>
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>3D</em></span>BOXX is a series of high-performance
Windows and Linux workstations offered by BOXX Technologies
(Austin, Texas) for digital applications such as film, HDTV, video
and game development. One user of <span   class="emphasis"><em>3D</em></span>BOXX Linux
machines is Blur, a visual effects, animation and design studio
located in Venice, California. They produced a four-minute stereo
3-D 70mm ride for Paramount Parks called The 7th Portal.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>3D</em></span>BOXX systems start at $2,309.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Render</em></span>BOXX server systems start at $2,692 (see
<a href="http://www.boxxtech.com" target="_self">http://www.boxxtech.com/</a>).</p><p>OpenML is a new API that hopes to do for video software
developers what OpenGL has done for graphics developers. The
Khronos Group consists of leading graphics and digital media
companies including 3Dlabs, ATI, Discreet, Evans &amp; Sutherland,
Intel, NVIDIA, SGI and Sun Microsystems. The Khronos Group
announced at NAB that they had completed the OpenML 1.0
Specification. OpenML is based on the dmSDK, which SGI recently
made open source, and MLdc, an abstraction layer for display
devices. Video effects software maker Discreet is helping to drive
the requirements. Neil Trevett of 3Dlabs who made the announcement
says, &ldquo;We hope to encourage an open-source implementation in
Linux.&rdquo; (See
<a href="http://www.khronos.org" target="_self">http://www.khronos.org/</a>
and
<a href="http://oss.sgi.com" target="_self">http://oss.sgi.com/</a>.)</p><p>The release of the AAF (Advanced Authoring Format) software
development kit version 1.0 was announced by the Pro-MPEG Forum at
NAB. The software is intended to interchange video, audio and
metadata in postproduction applications (see
<a href="http://www.aafassociation.org" target="_self">http://www.aafassociation.org/</a>
and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/aaf/</a>).</p><p>Besides exhibitors, there was a Linux-specific session in the
NAB conference: &ldquo;Linux and MP3 for Archiving&rdquo;. Radio Free Asia
(www.rfa.org) broadcasts via shortwave radio and the Web in
Tibetan, Cantonese, Uyghur, Burmese, Vietnamese, Lao, Khmer (to
Cambodia) and Korean (to North Korea). RFA is a private corporation
funded by the US Congress to bring news and information to
populations lacking a free press. Their first broadcast was to
China in September 1996. RFA broadcasts 34 hours of programming per
day in nine languages.</p><p>RFA production support manager A. J. Janitschek and lead
technical engineer Tom Hallewell described the evolution of the RFA
MP3 archive technology. &ldquo;At Radio Free Asia we used to archive all
of our audio as WAV files onto 4GB DAT tapes&rdquo;, said Janitschek.
But that was expensive, labor intensive and inconvenient to search
and retrieve. &ldquo;With our current system we can store 100 hours of
archive programming on a single CD-ROM and make it available to
anyone who has an MP3 player on their PC&rdquo;, added Hallewell.</p><p>RFA uses about 15 CD-ROMs to archive a month's audio (1,020
hours). They use three different 16-bit encoding settings: 1)
32khz, 48kbs and 20MB/hr for broadcast quality (over shortwave); 2)
16khz, 16kbs and 7MB/hr for long-term storage; and 3) 12khz, 14kbs
and 6MB/hr for broadcast on the Web.</p><p>RFA doesn't encode their MP3 streams on a PC, but uses the
Telos Audioactive Realtime MPEG Internet Audio Encoder. This
rackmount box multicasts MP3s that they capture on their Linux
archive system and burn onto CD-ROMs. Janitschek says the
advantages of a hardware encoder include real-time performance and
the fact that MP3 patent licenses (to Fraunhofer and THOMSON) are
covered. The unit sells for $2,800 (see
<a href="http://www.audioactive.com" target="_self">http://www.audioactive.com/</a>).</p><p>RFA not only uses Linux to archive their content, they also
are contributing to open-source software. R-BOSS (Radio-Broadcast
Open Source System) is a collection of digital broadcast content
management applications written using Python. Also available is
their 3D-Project, a free distribution of broadcast specific 3-D
drawings, material and texture bitmap files. For further
information or to download, see
<a href="http://www.techweb.rfa.org" target="_self">http://www.techweb.rfa.org/</a>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4743f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Radio Free Asia Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>And there were other Linux exhibitors at NAB. Real Networks
offered streaming and playing on Linux. Kasenna was showing their
asset management system, which supports Linux. Thomcast
Communications introduced the DCX Millennium Digital Transmitter,
which can be controlled by Linux. No doubt there were many more
Linux applications that we missed.</p><p>Next month we will return to our project of upgrading our
Debian Linux installation to the 2.4 kernel and XFree86 4.x GUI.
Time permitting, we will also install an ATI All-In-Wonder Radeon
graphics card.</p></div></div>
