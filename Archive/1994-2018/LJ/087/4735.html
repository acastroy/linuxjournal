    Sometimes too much just isn't enough.

he was interviewed by Robert X. Cringely for a PBS special called
&ldquo;Triumph of the Nerds&rdquo;, a televised version of Cringely's
brilliant book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Accidental Empires: How the Boys of
Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and
Still Can't Get a Date</em></span>. The best moment in the show came
when Cringely asked Jobs what he thought about Microsoft.
</p><p>Jobs leaned back, put on his best ironic smile and said,
&ldquo;They have no taste.&rdquo; There, in four perfect one-syllable words,
Jobs not only nailed Microsoft, but himself as well. True: while
Microsoft has no taste, Jobs has nothing but.</p><p>Tastelessness has hurt Microsoft about as much as it has
McDonalds. That much is obvious. Less obvious is what gets
camouflaged by taste-free product names and dull-as-dirt
descriptions of every new &ldquo;enabling service&rdquo;. Take .NET for
example. It was announced a year ago, and still nobody can say what
it is. When it came out, serious geeks like Joel Spolsky called it
camouflage. &ldquo;Read the white paper closely&rdquo;, he wrote, &ldquo;and
you'll see that for all the hoopla, .NET is just a thin cloud of
FUD. There's no there there. Try as you might to grasp onto
something, the entire white paper does not say anything. The harder
you grasp, the more it slips right through your fingers.&rdquo;</p><p>HailStorm was different. While the .NET announcement was
anesthesia, HailStorm was a wake-up call&mdash;at least for the geeks.
The feature that really set them off was an innocent-sounding
something called Passport. Here's Joel again:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Am I the only one who is terrified about
Microsoft Passport? It seems to me like a fairly blatant attempt to
build the world's largest, richest consumer database, and then make
fabulous profits mining it. It's a terrifying threat to everyone's
personal privacy and it will make today's &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; seem
positively tame by comparison. The scariest thing is that Microsoft
is advertising Passport as if it were a benefit to consumers, and
people seem to be falling for it!</p></blockquote></div><p>Let's pause to visit two well-camouflaged reasons why
Microsoft's products seem to achieve ubiquity so easily.
</p><p>First is where the company comes from. Since the beginning
(in 1975), Microsoft has been about personal computing. They care
about users first and everything else after that. The &ldquo;Micro&rdquo; in
their name isn't accidental.</p><p>Second, they pay very close attention to what users say they
want. I would bet that what one user says to one tech support
person has a far better chance of influencing software engineering
at Microsoft than at any other software company. In fact, one
high-up guy at Microsoft once told me that some of the company's
software is full of features that &ldquo;exactly one person asked
for&rdquo;.</p><p>Like every other gigantic industrial company that makes
products for millions of individuals, Microsoft runs into problems
when it begins to consider those individuals as something less than
customers. That something is the name that shows up in the midst of
Passport's URL:
<a href="http://www.passport.com/Consumer/default.asp" target="_self">www.passport.com/Consumer/default.asp</a>.
That's right, you're a consumer. You're what Jerry Michalski calls
a &ldquo;gullet&rdquo;: a creature that hangs around under the far end of the
supply chain's conveyor belt, where you live only to &ldquo;gulp down
products and crap out cash&rdquo;.</p><p>Pathetic creatures, consumers. Here's the HailStorm white
paper, &ldquo;Building the User-centric Experience&rdquo; on the awfulness
poor consumers must suffer with the PalmOS:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you want to enter a friend's new phone number
into your PC, you use a keyboard and a piece of software like
Microsoft Outlook to do it using a particular sequence of
keystrokes and mouse clicks. But to enter that same information
into your Palm Pilot, you need to learn a completely new
interface&mdash;right down to relearning how to draw the letters of the
alphabet! This environment, in which users are forced to adapt to
technology instead of technology adapting to users, creates
significant restrictions on how effective any application or web
site can be....</p></blockquote></div><p>And what would that awful environment be? Try a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>market</em></span>. But who wants to live in a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> market? Too messy. Too noisy. Too thick
with too many vendors, and too many customers figuring things out,
asking annoying questions. Too much like a real world. What the
consumer wants is cocoon-like habitat like the one they get with
TV: a supply system of one-way channels wired up like the vast
battery-charger in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span>.
</p><p>From the matrix end, HailStorm is a set of &ldquo;services&rdquo;. From
the battery's end, it's the Passport:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A HailStorm-enabled device or application will,
with your consent, connect to the appropriate HailStorm services
automatically. Because the myriad of applications and devices in
your life will be connected to a common set of information that you
control, you'll be able to securely share information between those
different technologies, as well as with other people and
services....
</p><p>The HailStorm architecture is designed for consistency across
services and seamless extensibility. It provides common identity,
messaging, naming, navigation, security, role mapping, data
modeling, metering, and error handling across all HailStorm
services. HailStorm looks and feels like a dynamic, partitioned,
schematized XML store. It is accessed via XML message interfaces
(XMIs), where service interfaces are exposed as standard SOAP
messages, arguments and return values are XML, and all services
support HTTP Post as message transfer protocol.</p></blockquote></div><p>Of course this all comes at a price:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Microsoft will operate the HailStorm services as
a business. The HailStorm services will have real operational
costs, and rather than risk compromising the user-centric model by
having someone such as advertisers pay for these services, the
people receiving the value&mdash;the end users&mdash;will be the primary
source of revenue to Microsoft. HailStorm will help move the
Internet to end-user subscriptions, where users pay for value
received.</p></blockquote></div>

In other words, Microsoft will turn the commercial side of the
Internet into a big on-line service. But not one on the cable TV
model, where you pay for a spigot at the end of the pipe. Oh, no,
you want an &aacute; la carte model, where you, the battery, pays
for everything. This is much more fair and efficient than the
current credit-card system, which takes a cut out of the sell side
of the final transaction.
</p><p>Remember when Microsoft tried to buy Intuit? The banking and
credit card industries went bonkers and lobbied successfully
against the deal. HailStorm cuts them out almost entirely, but I
suspect they have no idea what's really going on here. The
camouflage is working.</p><p>But not with developers. Microsoft can't do this alone. So
here's what's in it for the small fry:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Microsoft will also derive some revenue from
developers to help cover the costs of the services and products
they need....
</p><p>Service operators will also have a certificate-based license
relationship with Microsoft....That certificate will make it
possible to filter abusers out of the system. Obtaining a
certificate and the ongoing right to use HailStorm services will
have a cost associated with it.</p></blockquote></div><p>So there we have it: a blueprint for internet-based commerce,
built by a Microsoft-enabled software industry, intermediated over
Microsoft infrastructure, built by Microsoft and its allied
developers.
</p><p>I want to pause here to note that I'm not just bashing
Microsoft here. I'm bashing what we've always called
&ldquo;consumerism&rdquo; but which we would more accurately call
producerism&mdash;the belief that Production can tell Consumption what
it wants. A couple months ago in this space I gave Dell and Gateway
some grief for doing the same thing with the cattle-chute choices
it forced on visitors to their web sites.</p><p>With Hailstorm, Microsoft extends the cattle chute system to
one by which every gullet can plug directly into the end of every
value chain. Given the ubiquity of Windows, that's exactly what
will happen. Or that's the idea.</p><p>The problem here isn't that Hailstorm cuts out competitors,
or intermediaries, or anybody else. It's that it cuts out markets.
It bypasses the bazaar. It embraces and extends what producerism
has succeeded in doing ever since John Wanamaker invented the price
tag in the late 1800s.</p><p>The challenge for the rest of us is to do with markets what
we did with the Net in the first place: create ubiquitous
conditions that make matrix-building impossible. That requires
something many of us are not accustomed to doing: thinking about
commerce. Specifically, thinking about markets as places, as
environments, rather than as targets for stuff shoved down through
the industrial distribution matrix.</p><p>For cultural reasons alone, this won't be easy. In
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Homesteading the Noosphere</em></span>, Eric S. Raymond
said that, among the &ldquo;varieties of hacker ideology&rdquo; there is a
certain &ldquo;hostility to commercial software and/or the companies
perceived to dominate the commercial software market.&rdquo; But hackers
also built the Net, which was such an obviously promising
environment for business that investors spent something like a
trillion dollars funding fantasies about it, putting the technology
sector on a cocaine binge from which it will take years to
recover.</p><p>Obviously, most of the investors didn't know what the hackers
were really up to. Here's Eric S. Raymond, in early '99, way before
the bubble burst: &ldquo;We hackers were actively aiming to create new
kinds of conversations outside of traditional institutions. This
wasn't an accidental byproduct of doing neat techie stuff; it was
an explicit goal for many of us as far back as the 1970s. We
intended this revolution.&rdquo;</p><p>With Linux we built a bazaar for developers. Now it's time to
build one for everybody else. Let's create an interstructure for
commerce which, like the Net, nobody owns, everybody can use, and
anybody can improve.</p><p>Real markets are public places. You can't privatize what only
works because it's public. But if we don't have something that
works for everybody, somebody's going to build it for themselves.
And it won't be pretty.</p></div></div>
