    Learning shorthand for complicated Java code.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad1660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have looked
at server-side Java from a number of perspectives. We began with
servlets, Java classes that are executed from within a servlet
container. While programmers are not especially daunted by
servlets, graphic designers might feel otherwise.
</p><p>Solving this problem are JavaServer Pages (JSPs) that combine
Java and HTML, using a syntax similar to Microsoft's Active Server
Pages (ASP) or the open-source HTML::Mason system for mod_perl.
Each JSP is really a servlet in disguise; the JSP engine translates
the page into a servlet, and then compiles the servlet into a Java
.class file.</p><p>JSPs can include straight Java code that can make it easier
to perform complex actions. But at a certain point, this code can
overwhelm the HTML, making it impossible to maintain the JSP.
Nonprogrammers are also turned off by large amounts of code inside
a JSP, defeating much of the purpose of using JSPs instead of
straight servlets.</p><p>Last month, we looked at one way to avoid putting code inside
of JSPs using JavaBeans. Using simple XML-based tags, a
nonprogrammer can put together JSPs that exhibit complex behaviors,
without having to write a single line of code. Indeed, the real
magic of JavaBeans is not the beans themselves, but rather the
special tags that allow us to work with them so easily.</p><p>This month, we will learn how to write our own &ldquo;custom
actions&rdquo;, as they are known&mdash;XML-based tags that allow us to work
with Java classes and methods without having to work with Java
itself. Our examples are designed to work with the open-source
Jakarta-Tomcat implementation of servlets and JSPs. However, they
should work with any JSP implementation that works with custom
actions.</p><p>There are a number of reasons to use custom tags. First of
all, they reduce the amount of Java code we must put inside of our
JSPs, making them easier to read, understand and maintain. In
addition, custom tags are less complicated than Java code, making
them suitable for a wider audience than Java code users. Finally,
each custom tag library points to a centrally written and
maintained Java class. Using custom actions, a site can thus create
a library of tags appropriate for its particular needs. One Java
programmer can create and publish a tag library for a number of
graphic designers and JSP authors. As we will see, custom tags
aren't a panacea, but they can be quite useful, and I consider them
one of the most compelling reasons to use JSP over competing
technologies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad1920"></a>What Are Custom Actions?</h2></div></div><p>Custom actions provide us with a shorthand for complex Java
code within our JSP. Anything you do with a custom action could
also be accomplished with Java code inside of the scriptlet (&lt;%
%&gt;) tag. After all, the JSP is turned into a servlet before it
is compiled and executed for end users.</p><p>As we saw last month with JavaBean tags, custom actions are
defined with XML rather than HTML. This can be confusing and
frustrating at first, especially for those of us who have acquired
bad habits when writing HTML. The following might appear to be
legal:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;&lt;jsp:getProperty name="simple"
property="userID"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>But in fact, the above line will not work and will result in
an exception and stack trace within the JSP. That's because all
tags in XML must be closed somehow. If a &lt;tag&gt; has no
matching &lt;/tag&gt;, then it must indicate that it closes itself
with &lt;tag/&gt;. Thus, the above line must actually be written
as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;&lt;jsp:getProperty name="simple"
property="userID"/&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
</pre>


Custom actions are merely syntactic sugar for Java methods. Each
tag library defines a set of actions. For example, the jsp tag
library defines three actions: &ldquo;getProperty&rdquo;, &ldquo;setProperty&rdquo; and
&ldquo;useBean&rdquo;. Each action is defined by a single Java class, known
as a tag handler.
</p><p>To define a tag library, we create an XML file known as a tag
library descriptor, or TLD. The TLD connects each action to its
appropriate tag handler class, listing optional and mandatory
attributes, as well as other information about the tags.</p><p>To use our custom actions within a JSP, we use a special
directive to load our TLD. This helps the JSP engine to validate
the custom tags within our JSP, as well as to find the tag handler
class associated with these actions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad1c38"></a>A Simple Custom Action</h2></div></div><p>We will now define one simple custom action in order to
understand the underlying mechanics of working with tag handler
classes, TLDs and JSPs.</p><p>Our custom action will be a &ldquo;hello&rdquo; tag, which takes an
optional &ldquo;firstname&rdquo; parameter. If the parameter is there, our
tag will produce a simple &ldquo;hello&rdquo; message to the named user. If
the parameter is missing, our tag will produce a generic &ldquo;hello&rdquo;
message.</p><p>The first step is to write a simple tag handler that will
implement this functionality. Such a tag handler is shown in
Listing 1, defining the HelloTag class. I put the HelloTag.java
source file, along with all JSP- and servlet-related classes, under
the $TOMCAT_HOME/classes directory. Since HelloTag.java is in the
il.co.lerner package, and since $TOMCAT_HOME on my machine is
/usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1, this means I placed my Java source
file in:</p><p>/usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1/classes/il/co/lerner/HelloTag.java</p><p><a href="4716l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. HelloTag Tag
Handler</a></p><p>After compiling HelloTag.java into HelloTag.class, this tag
handler can be incorporated into one or more tag libraries.</p><p>Each tag handler class must implement one of two different
standard interfaces, Tag or BodyTag. (The latter is for custom
actions that have a body between their opening and closing tags,
rather than those we will discuss this month, which have no
body.)</p><p>In practice, there is no reason to implement these
interfaces. It is easier and more practical to inherit from the
TagSupport and BodyTagSupport classes, which provide default
implementations for the interfaces. By subclassing TagSupport, we
can save ourselves some work, overriding only those methods for
which we don't want the default behavior. In the end, our
implementation of HelloTag requires only three methods:
setFirstname, doEndTag and release.</p><p>The first method, setFirstname, looks and acts just like a
JavaBean property-setting method, taking a single argument and
returning void. setFirstname is invoked automatically when the JSP
engine encounters our custom action with a &ldquo;firstname&rdquo; parameter.
The parameter value is set to the value passed in the tag. As with
JavaBeans, the method that sets firstname must be named
setFirstname, with a capital &ldquo;F&rdquo;.</p><p>Our second method, doEndTag, is invoked when the JSP engine
encounters our custom action's closing tag. The doEndTag method
takes no arguments and returns an integer. But instead of returning
an integer, we will return one of the symbolic constants provided
for us. Normally, we will return EVAL_PAGE, which tells the JSP
engine that it should continue to evaluate the remainder of the JSP
from which our custom action was invoked. If we wish to stop the
JSP engine from evaluating the file any more, either because we
have encountered an error or because we want to forward the user to
another URL, we can return SKIP_PAGE instead.</p><p>Inside of doEndTag, we can place any Java code we might like.
In addition to any instance variables we create, we have access to
information about the JSP itself, including its HTTP request and
response. This is how we can write information to the user's
browser, replacing the custom tag with HTML, XML or plain text.
(Custom actions generally return plain text, allowing the JSP
author to choose how that text will be formatted.) Using the
PageContext object, defined by our TagSupport superclass, we can
retrieve an output stream and send data to it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pageContext.getOut().println("Hi there!");
</pre><p>Finally, we define the release method, which takes no
parameters and returns void. release() is invoked when the custom
action has finished execution, and it gives the tag handler class a
chance to clean up after itself. In general, this means setting
each of the instance variables to null, but it might also involve
closing a connection to a relational database or sending
information to the error log. In HelloTag.java, we simply assign
firstname the null value, and then ask our superclass to nullify
each of its own values.
</p><p>Now that we understand each of the individual methods in
HelloTag, how do they work together? When a JSP contains a custom
action mapped to our class (via the TLD, described below), each of
the action's parameters invokes a &ldquo;set&rdquo; method in our class. For
example, someone passing the parameter firstname=&ldquo;foo&rdquo; will
effectively invoke setFirstname(&ldquo;foo&rdquo;).</p><p>Since we want to make firstname an optional parameter, we
give it a default value (null) when we first create it. When the
JSP engine finishes evaluating our custom action, it invokes
doEndTag and looks at the value of firstname. If firstname is null,
it sends a generic (&ldquo;Hi there!&rdquo;) message to the end user. If
firstname is non-null, however, doEndTag uses its value to send a
more personal message to the end user.</p><p>When the custom action has finished executing, the JSP engine
invokes release(), resetting firstname and a number of other
objects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad22c0"></a>Writing the TLD</h2></div></div><p>Once we have written our class, we can write a TLD that
describes it to the JSP engine. Many people might prefer to work in
the opposite direction, using the TLD as a specification JSP
authors and tag handlers can use while working in parallel. I
prefer to write the custom actions first, modifying the TLD as I go
along, even though this is admittedly not the safest nor the most
elegant means of working.</p><p>The TLD, as you can see from Listing 2, can be a relatively
short XML file. The TLD maps action names to the classes that
implement those actions. A TLD can map a single action to a single
class, or it might map hundreds of actions to hundreds of different
classes. And because each class exists separately, it is even
possible (though hardly a good idea) for a class to be used in
multiple TLDs simultaneously.</p><p><a href="4716l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. hello.tld</a></p><p>The TLD is loaded into our servlet container when it is first
referenced. Unfortunately, this means that changing the TLD after
the custom action has already been invoked requires restarting
Tomcat (and Apache, if you are using Apache's mod_jk along with the
Tomcat server). It tells the JSP engine which versions and
specifications your tag library supports, making it possible for a
JSP engine to know when a particular library needs to be upgraded
in order to be compatible with current standards.</p><p>The TLD consists of a top-level &lt;taglib&gt; tag, which
contains a minimum of four sections: &lt;tlibversion&gt; indicates
the version of the tag library specification this library supports;
&lt;jspversion&gt; indicates the version of the JSP specification
for which the tag library was written; &lt;shortname&gt; gives this
tag library a name, which some JSP engines use; and &lt;tag&gt;
appears once for every tag handler class we want to include in our
library. Each tag gets its own name, the name of the action that is
invoked. Thus, if we import a tag library with a prefix of &ldquo;abc&rdquo;,
the tag named &ldquo;hello&rdquo; will be invoked as &ldquo;abc:hello&rdquo;. The
&lt;tagclass&gt; section maps the tag's name to the tag handler
class that actually performs the actions; this class must obviously
be in your server's CLASSPATH. The &lt;info&gt; section allows us
to provide some basic information and in-line documentation about
this particular tag.</p><p>Finally, we name each of the attributes this custom action
takes. Each attribute has its own &lt;name&gt; tag, as well as an
indication of whether the attribute is required.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad25d8"></a>Using Custom Actions in a JSP</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have a TLD and a tag handler class, we can use
them together in any of our JSPs. We import the tag library using
the special JSP taglib directive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;%@ taglib uri="/WEB-INF/hello.tld"
prefix="hello" %&gt;
</pre><p>Notice how the taglib directive takes two parameters, &ldquo;uri&rdquo;
and &ldquo;prefix&rdquo;. The uri portion contains the filename of the TLD
that we just created. If you want to put TLDs directly inside your
WEB-INF directory, then the above syntax is perfectly valid. The
prefix parameter is a sort of namespace declaration, telling the
JSP engine what prefix we will attach to each of the actions the
tag library imports. Giving the JSP the option of naming the
prefix, rather than building it into the tag library itself, allows
us to import multiple tag libraries without having to worry about
namespace clashes.
</p><p>Since our TLD defines a single &ldquo;hello&rdquo; tag, and since we
imported the tag library using the &ldquo;hello&rdquo; prefix, we can invoke
our HelloTag methods using the following syntax:
<b  >&lt;hello:hello/&gt;</b>. Listing 3 contains a
complete JSP (test-tag.jsp) that demonstrates how we can use this
tag.</p><p><a href="4716l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
test-tag.jsp</a></p><p>Remember to include the trailing slash when invoking custom
actions. If you forget to include it, Tomcat's JSP engine (known as
Jasper) will produce an error message similar to the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Unterminated user-defined tag:
ending tag &amp;lt;/hello:hello&amp;gt; not found or
incorrectly nested
</pre><p>Our TLD indicates the firstname attribute is optional. If we
don't pass a firstname parameter, then we get the following output
in our web browser:
<pre     class="programlisting">
This is a test of our custom action.
Hi there!
</pre>


We can also pass an optional firstname parameter:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;hello:hello firstname="Reuven"/&gt;
</pre>


If we put the above in our JSP, the following output is sent to the
browser:
<pre     class="programlisting">
This is a test of our custom action.
Hello, Reuven
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad2b00"></a>More Advanced Custom Actions</h2></div></div><p>The above is a trivial example of how custom actions work.
Custom action tags can do much more than simply print names. For
example, objects can connect to a relational database, retrieving
(or storing) information without requiring explicit Java inside of
our JSPs. Custom actions can also act as iterators or provide us
with conditional execution.</p><p>In order to perform these more advanced actions, we will take
advantage of the fact that a tag handler class can look at the body
of a custom action; that is, whatever text might happen to reside
between the action's opening and closing tags. We can do all sorts
of things with this text, ranging from iteration and conditional
execution to asking the JSP engine to evaluate its contents before
passing it to the tag handler. It is even possible to nest one tag
inside of another, effectively passing values from one action to
another.</p><p>There are a number of open-source tag libraries, including
one provided by the Jakarta project itself, which use these
functions to provide a great deal of functionality in a number of
tags.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ad2cb8"></a>Are Custom Actions a Good Thing?</h2></div></div><p>Custom actions are an extremely powerful tool. They provide a
wealth of advantages over putting straight Java code inside of
JSPs, encapsulate complex behavior inside of easy-to-remember tags,
make it relatively easy for nonprogrammers to work with databases
and other nontrivial systems.</p><p>But there is a problem with custom actions that can be traced
back to the word &ldquo;custom&rdquo;. The ability to define your own tags
within JSPs is a clever and sophisticated tool and provides a
number of benefits to everyone involved in developing a web site.
However, part of the beauty of the Web is that it is relatively
standardized.</p><p>Moreover, custom actions can be used to create an entirely
new language written in Java and implemented in tag handler
classes. Hans Bergsten, whose book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaServer
Pages</em></span>, provides excellent information and instruction in
JSPs, pushes this idea to the limit, effectively removing the need
for Java within JSPs. However, it disturbs me to see the
replacement of a relatively stable and well-known language (Java)
with a new, less-known and less battle-tested language (his custom
tag libraries).</p><p>If I were working at a large corporation that had decided to
make a major investment in Java, servlets and JSPs, I would feel
quite comfortable using custom actions. Such a company is in a
position to create its own tag library that can be used over the
life of a web site, defining its own standards for how things
work.</p><p>But for those of us working outside of a large corporation,
or who work with a number of different clients, interoperability is
a paramount concern. If each of my clients were to define a
different set of custom actions for their sites, I would find
myself struggling to remember which tags and attributes I need to
use for loops, database access and conditional execution. And as I
indicated above, I worry about working with nonprogrammers who
already struggle with the idea of learning to embed Java inside of
their HTML pages&mdash;teaching them two different types of loops (one
in Java, and another with custom actions) will undoubtedly lead to
some confusion.</p><p>A good compromise solution might be the inclusion of a large,
standard set of custom actions that will be made part of the JSP
specification, much as has been done with JavaBean-related tags.
The tag library presented in Bergsten's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java Server
Pages</em></span> is a good start but is only one of many such
available libraries. It would be nice to see the JSP community get
together on this issue, before we find ourselves faced with dozens
of similar but incompatible libraries, some of which will
undoubtedly be proprietary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d9580.0x1ac98b8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>JSPs are a powerful and quick way to work with server-side
Java, particularly for nonprogrammers who don't want to learn a
language. Custom actions, particularly when combined with JavaBean
components, make it possible to perform complex tasks with a
minimum of code. With some forethought, a site can avoid inserting
nearly any Java code into their JSPs, relying instead on custom
actions and tag libraries.</p><p>However, sites (and consultants who use custom actions)
should balance the convenience and power of tag libraries with the
fact that they are effectively creating a new programming language.
If we aren't careful, custom tags will cause a split in the
server-side Java community, fracturing it into subcommunities that
use different, incompatible libraries.</p><p><a href="4716s1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Sidebar</b></span></a></p></div></div>
