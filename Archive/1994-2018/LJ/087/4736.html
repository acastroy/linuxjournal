Linux</h2></div></div><p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of Pasadena, California
is one of the space program's major players. Managed for NASA by
the California Institute of Technology, JPL is the lead US center
for robotic exploration of the solar system, and its spacecrafts
have visited all known planets except Pluto. In addition to its
work for NASA, JPL conducts research and development projects for a
variety of federal agencies. One such project, the Corps Battle
Simulation (CBS), recently made the transition from VAX to Red Hat
Linux 7.0, resulting in a substantial increase in performance at
considerably reduced cost.</p><p>CBS has been used to train army officers in battle tactics
for over 15 years. Previously, it ran on VAX's most powerful
computer, a $100,000-plus 7800-series machine. However, due to the
steadily increasing intelligence and the addition of new features,
CBS reached its limitations on VAX. This made further innovation a
struggle and threatened to render the battle simulator obsolete
within a few years. As a result, the US Army's Simulation, Training
and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), in Orlando, Florida asked
JPL to port the software to Linux in order to increase
functionality while cutting cost.</p><p>After spending a man-year reconfiguring CBS source code, then
recompiling, testing and debugging, the team benchmarked the system
running on Linux with rewarding results. &ldquo;By porting CBS from VAX
to Linux, we have achieved far better performance at a much reduced
cost and have lots of extra capacity&rdquo;, says Jay Braun, a
simulation software technologist at JPL.</p><p>The additional capacity of Linux gives the CBS system more
room to expand. Terrain elevation, for instance, can now be modeled
to a highly detailed level. Previously, attempting complex
line-of-sight calculations severely taxed VAX capabilities. Now,
high-fidelity maps are available on Linux that make simulations
more realistic, increasing the accuracy of the battle
scenarios.</p><p>CBS is running on a $4,000 PC with a 1.2GHz AMD Athlon
processor. This Linux machine runs the largest CBS exercise almost
four times faster than the most powerful VAX, without sacrificing
anything in model fidelity. Using the VAX, fidelity had to be
reduced in order to allow a simulation to progress at a one-to-one
game ratio, i.e., a virtual minute in the simulation requires a
real minute of execution time. Under Linux, however, one-to-one
scenarios can be achieved at the highest quality levels
available.</p><p>JPL has also made adjustments so that CBS has a 20-second
save time for the largest exercises and three seconds for small
exercises. This is an order of magnitude faster than the old VAX
system. Under Linux the application can now represent almost 3GB of
virtual address space for each simulation. &ldquo;That's a big image!&rdquo;
says Braun. &ldquo;Our model has plenty of features that are pushing the
limits of Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>JPL will deliver the ported software in June 2001. Braun
predicts that in the near future, the system will further advance
to a two-processor machine that can support additional simulations.
JPL is now shifting over to Red Hat Linux 7.1 with the new 2.4
kernel.</p><p>&mdash;Drew Robb</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17f2580.0x18ea7c0"></a>Now Everybody Knows Where You Live</h2></div></div><p>Wonder what the weenies at Google are up to, besides finding

Vice Versa)</h2></div></div><p>It's starting to look like a tsunami of Linux-based PDAs is
about to spread out of Asia. From Japan, Sharp recently announced
that it would roll out a new PDA based on Linux rather than an OS
from Palm or Microsoft. The Korea-based G.Mate Yopy is a PDA that
uses a speech interface from Conversay, a company headquartered in
Redmond, Washington. Ericsson Singapore and Singapore's Centre for
Wireless Communications have announced a jointly-developed
&ldquo;handheld computer&rdquo; called the DelphiPad that runs Linux,
features a 10-inch touch screen and is scheduled to sell in the
fourth quarter of 2001 for under $1,000 US. VTech has the Helio.
And you can put several forms of embedded Linux into Compaq's iPAQ
and other PDAs.</p><p>But the PDA with major momentum at the moment, judging from
the sudden upswelling of buzz in the Linux community, is the Agenda
VR, from Agenda Computing. While Agenda is owned by Kessell
International of Hong Kong, which also handles manufacturing, the
company's whole agenda (pun intended) seems to originate out of its
Irvine, California offices, where the company is run by its
president, Bradley La Ronde.</p><p>Recently I was on The Linux Show with Brad, who seemed to be
at least as committed to mobilized Linux as the OS' famous creator.
I got the distinct impression that Agenda is a harbinger of change
in the consumer electronics business, from one controlled by
corporate giants to one controlled by small developers who take
advantage of freely available technologies that are constantly
improved by their surrounding development communities. I later
found out that this particular show was one of the most popular in
the history of the program.</p><p>Then a couple days ago I got this unsolicited e-mail:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Went to my first linux users group meeting in
like a year last night
(<a href="http://www.nblug.org" target="_self">http://www.nblug.org/</a>,
North Bay Linux Users Group) and the CEO/President/Developer from
Agenda Computing was there giving a demonstration and talk about
the VR3 Linux-based PDA's they're putting out....Don't know if
you've checked them out before, but they're actually a lot cooler
and more usable than I thought they would be.</p></blockquote></div><p>Later he added,
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>They're a little slow&mdash;but a big part of the
discussion revolved around various ways of solving that. It was
very, very cool to have a realistic, technical discussion with a
CEO about their product. I spoke with him afterwards, and we agreed
on some points where they're going to have difficulty in the
marketplace, but the part I cared most about was his honesty. Very
clued, in my view.</p></blockquote></div>

And that was just one guy. Agenda is clearly making some smart
moves with the Linux community. From the start, Agenda's agenda has
been to put out an inexpensive ($249 MSRP) basic PDA that runs
Linux in a form so inviting to Linux hackers that they'll jump in
and write all kinds of stuff for it. This appears to be exactly
what's happening. There are a growing pile of independent developer
sites, which, together with Agenda, have put together a rapidly
growing pile of apps for the Agenda VR&mdash;and, presumably, for other
LinuxVR-based (linux-vr.org) devices, which also include PDAs from
Vadem, Casio and Everex.
</p><p>In the words of Ian LeWinter, Agenda's VP Marketing, the
Agenda VR will compete with Palm, Handspring and other PDA
companies for a reason that has nothing to do with Linux' hermit
crab-like ability to run in almost anything. The whole look and
feel of the device &ldquo;screams cool&rdquo;. It's truly palm-sized (4.5" x
3.0" x 0.8"), comes in three colors, runs on NEC's 66MHz 32-bit
MIPS processor, with 8MB RAM + 16MB Flash Memory, both IrDA and its
own peripheral ports. Audio, too.</p><p>According to the independent supermegamulti.com/agenda/ site,
there were 93 Agenda VR3 programs in the on-line software
depsitory. Those include 23 apps, 16 games and 22 utilities. By the
time you read this the number will certainly be much higher.</p><p>A review of the Agenda VR is in the works for a future
