filtering particular kinds of network traffic between two networks.
They are usually employed to protect a LAN from the rest of the
Internet. Securing every box on the LAN is much more costly and
time consuming than deploying, administering and monitoring a
single firewall. A firewall is particularly essential to those
institutions permanently connected to the Internet. Depending on
the network configuration, the router can be set up as a packet
filter; usually, though, it is more convenient to set up a
dedicated box to act as a firewall. Because they can be made
extremely secure and have a low cost, Linux boxes can be very
effective firewalls.
</p><p>Deploying a firewall on the Linux kernels 2.2.x is done with
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span>, while
<span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span> are used on the new 2.4.x
kernels. How to set up the actual firewall is beyond the scope of
this article; we refer the reader to the ipchains HOWTO for the
2.2.x kernels and to Paul &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Russell's Packet-Filtering
HOWTO for the 2.4.x kernels. Both of them can be found on the
Internet by using any search engine. But building the actual
firewall is not enough; in order to offer tight security, a
firewall needs to be monitored. In this article we explain how to
build and use a web-based ipchains monitoring system called
<span   class="bold"><b>inside-control</b></span>.</p><p>There are two main uses of a firewall monitoring system: to
check that no malicious cracker is trying to wreak havoc in the
internal LAN and to check that users inside the LAN are not abusing
the internet service.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ed0870"></a>Firewall Setup Example</h2></div></div><p>Here is a setup for a very simple firewall to which we will
refer as a working example later in the article.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that the internal network is
10.0.1.0/255.255.255.0, the Linux gateway/firewall has the
addresses 10.0.1.1 on the interface connected to the internal LAN
and 10.200.200.1 on the interface connected to the Internet (both
IP addresses are in fact nonroutable, so this is just a fictitious
example). The first step to setting up a firewall is to enable
gatewaying between the network interfaces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre><p>We then proceed to build up a logging firewall using
ipchains. First we flush all preceding rules, and we allow packets
on the loopback interface and all ICMP packets:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -F
ipchains -A input -i lo -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -p ICMP -j ACCEPT
</pre>


Now we block and log the Telnet protocol from the Internet to the
internal LAN:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -A input -p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d 10.0.1.0/24 23 -l -j DENY
</pre>


But we allow and log the HTTP protocol from the internal LAN to the
Internet:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -A input -p TCP -s 10.0.1.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0 80 -l -j ACCEPT
</pre>


Finally we set up permissive policies:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -P input ACCEPT
</pre>


This firewall blocks and logs all incoming Telnet connections, it
allows and logs all outgoing HTTP connections, and it allows
everything else (see Figure 1). Such a setup is too permissive for
serious protection, but it will illustrate well what the automated
log scanning script can do.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4543f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Setup of Sample Firewall
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The file the firewall outputs its logs to is usually either
/var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages. In order to find out which
one, you can do</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep -q "Packet log" /var/log/syslog &amp;&amp; echo yes
</pre><p>If it outputs &ldquo;yes&rdquo; then it is /var/log/syslog, if it
outputs nothing it is most probably /var/log/messages. You can
confirm with
<pre     class="programlisting">
grep -q "Packet log" /var/log/messages &amp;&amp; echo yes
</pre>


If both commands produce no output, then the firewall is inactive
or there was no logged traffic (in our example, Telnet and HTTP)
through the firewall.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ed0ef8"></a>2.4.x Kernels and iptables</h2></div></div><p>Regarding the 2.4.x kernels and iptables, things are a bit
more complicated. First you must remember to compile the kernel
with all of the packet-filtering options, including the LOG target.
Second, change ipchains to iptables. Then change the names of the
chains to uppercase (e.g., input becomes INPUT). Next, change the
name of the targets (DENY becomes DROP). Lastly, specify port
numbers in a different way. Listing 1 is the 2.4.x sequence of
commands equivalent to the 2.2.x sequence of commands given
above.</p><p><a href="4543l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. 2.4.x iptable Command
Sequence</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ed10b0"></a>ipchains Log Format</h2></div></div><p>Let us now examine a sample log entry from our firewall's
/var/log/syslog:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Jun 12 16:15:54 myfirewall kernel: Packet log: input DENY eth1 PROTO=6 212.65.214.2:34251 10.0.1.2:23 L=52 S=0x10 I=24016 F=0x4000 T=53 SYN (#38)
</pre><p>This means that at quarter past four in the afternoon on 12
June, the firewall (called, rather boringly, myfirewall) denied and
logged a packet coming into its network interface eth1 (the
external interface on the Internet) with the TCP protocol coming
from 212.65.214.2 (from port 34251), directed to 10.0.1.2 (on port
23, i.e., the Telnet port) and having a length of 52 bytes. We
shall skip most of the other details, apart from one: &ldquo;SYN&rdquo; means
that the packet is the first packet of a connection. In practice,
this information is very useful in discriminating those packets
that are part of a pre-existing connection (that might have been
initiated from the internal LAN) and those packets that attempt to
establish a connection from the Internet towards the internal LAN.
Usually one allows &ldquo;reply&rdquo; packets (which do not have the &ldquo;SYN&rdquo;
flag set) but denies &ldquo;SYN&rdquo; packets because it means somebody out
there is trying to make a connection to a computer in the internal
LAN.
</p><p>Of course, it is possible to check the status of a firewall
by inspecting all relevant entries in the log file, but this is
feasible if one logs only a few strange-looking packets. For
example, on some firewalls I set up I decided to log all those
packets coming from the Internet towards port 31337 on computers on
the internal LAN, as 31337 is the default port BackOrifice uses.
Whenever one is interested in getting some statistics from the
firewall, it is likely that the size of the log file will be in
excess of 5MB per day. In such cases, inspection of the log file by
hand is no longer an option. This is when automated log scanning
comes in.</p><p>When analyzing 2.4.x kernel firewall logs, the format is
different:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Jun 12 16:15:54 myfirewall kernel: Packet log: IN=eth1 OUT= MAC=00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:08:00 SRC=212.65.214.2 DST=10.0.1.2 LEN=52 TOS=0x10 PREC=0x00 TTL=64 ID=0 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=34251 DPT=23 WINDOW=11592 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
</pre><p>The fields we are interested in are SRC (source IP address),
DST (destination IP address), SPT (source port), DPT (destination
port) and the presence or absence of the SYN flag.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ed13c8"></a>The inside-control Script Structure</h2></div></div><p>I am going to use Perl to build the log scanner. It is not
the only option and, in fact, in order to achieve top performance
one should use a compiled language. When I recoded this script in
C++, I observed an execution speed gain of 100%.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>inside-control</b></span> script is
composed of a main parsing loop and an HTML data display loop.
Since the script is a CGI it needs to reside on a web server
configured for running CGI programs.</p><p>Note that the code, as described below, sacrifices
functionality and useful details like error-checking for clarity.
For example, there is no check that &ldquo;opening a file&rdquo; was
successful before actually reading that file. Note also that the
code below is customized to analyze the packet-logging format of
kernels 2.2.x. Changing to the logging format of kernels 2.4.x, on
the basis of the sample packet log described above, should be
straightforward.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ed15d8"></a>Main Parsing Loop</h2></div></div><p>First, we open the log file and initialize some variables
(those with Red Hat should use /var/log/messages instead of
/var/log/syslog):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl
open(LOGFILE, "/var/log/syslog");
$firstdate = "";
$date = "";
$total_traffic = 0;
</pre><p>Now we loop over each line in the log file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
while ( &lt;LOGFILE&gt; ) {
</pre>


Skip all log entries which do not belong to the firewall:
<pre     class="programlisting">
next unless /Packet log/;
</pre>


We also parse the line (warning: in the Perl script, write the last
line in this chunk as a whole long line, without the backslash):
<pre     class="programlisting">
chomp;
@log = split;
($month,$day,$time,$policy,$proto,$ipsource,$ipdest, \
$tot_len) = @log[0,1,2,8,10,11,12,13];
</pre>


We then calculate the date and store the first date in the log. As
we go on, we store the current date as the last date, so that after
the last step the variable lastdate will contain the last date in
the log:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$date = $day . " " . $month . " " . $time;
if (length($firstdate) == 0) {
  $firstdate = $date;
}
$lastdate = $date;
</pre>


Read the protocol type, the source IP address, the source port, the
destination IP address, the destination port and the packet length:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$proto = substr($proto, -1);
($ips, $ports) = split ":", $ipsource;
($ipd, $portd) = split ":", $ipdest;
($flush, $packetlen) = split "=", $tot_len;
</pre>


Now record the destination IP address in a string, and associate
that string to the source IP address so that in the data display
loop we will be able to loop over source IP addresses and retrieve
the hosts they connected to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
unless ( $sourcedest{$ips} =~ /$ipd/ ) {
  $sourcedest{$ips} = $sourcedest{$ips} . $ipd . " ";
}
</pre>


We count the log entries for the source IP address:
<pre     class="programlisting">
++$source{$ips};
</pre>


and sum up the total traffic volume:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$total_traffic += $packetlen;
</pre>


Finally, we sum up the per-host traffic volume:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$traffichost{$ips} += $packetlen;
}
</pre>


Notice that not all the information gathered has been used (no talk
of ports, for example), so there is plenty of room for expansion
here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ed1aa8"></a>Data Display Loop</h2></div></div><p>First we display a nice-looking web page header, as shown in
Listing 2.</p><p><a href="4543l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Web Page
Header</a></p><p>Loop over the sorted source IP addresses and print the source
IP address, the number of packets coming from that IP and the
traffic (in bytes) generated from that IP:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (sort keys %source) {
  print "&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;$_&lt;/TD&gt; ";
  print "&lt;TD&gt;$source{$_} &lt;/TD&gt;\n";
  print "&lt;TD&gt;$traffichost{$_} bytes&lt;/TD&gt;\n";
</pre><p>Now we are able to print the string containing the
destination IP addresses contacted by the current source IP
address:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$tmp1 = $sourcedest{$_};
if (length($tmp1) gt 0) {
  print "&lt;TD&gt;\n";
  @lt1 = split " ", $tmp1;
  for(sort @lt1) {
    printf "$_ &lt;br&gt;\n";
  }
  print " &lt;/TD&gt;\n";
}
print " &lt;/TR&gt;\n";
}
</pre>


Finally, we print the HTML tail:
<pre     class="programlisting">
print "&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n";
print "&lt;/center&gt;\n";
print "&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n";
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ec86a8"></a>The Downloadable inside-control Script</h2></div></div><p>The version of inside-control I actually implemented is
richer in functionality than the one presented here. You can
download the script from
<a href="http://www.iris-tech.net/hdsl-fw" target="_self">www.iris-tech.net/hdsl-fw</a>.
Some of the main added features include the ability to display
arbitrary names instead of IP addresses in the &ldquo;Source IP&rdquo;
column. This is done with a very simple text database that maps IP
numbers to names. The format is the same as the /etc/hosts file,
and you can use that file if it is meaningfully configured for your
internal LAN. The exact location of the &ldquo;IP to names&rdquo; database
file can be specified by changing the relevant variable
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>$useripdb</em></span>) at the beginning of the
script.</p><p>There is also a search facility that allows one to look for a
particular source IP address (or corresponding name found in the
&ldquo;IP to names&rdquo; database) in the logs. The search form is displayed
whenever the CGI is called without arguments from the browser.
Arguments passing is done by the GET method.</p><p>Additionally, the main loop includes some data validation
(the kernel cannot always log properly, especially on low RAM or
low-spec CPUs) and some storage of port-dependent
information.</p><p>Finally, the script can also be called without the web
interface. Just pass any argument to inside-control, and all HTML
output will be suppressed and some normal output will be provided
instead. A search string for a source IP address (or its
corresponding name found in the &ldquo;IP to names&rdquo; database) can be
passed to the program via the -t option.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd8580.0x1ec8968"></a>Notes and Caveats</h2></div></div><p>The purpose of this article is to explain some design
principles and give some hints, not to give a prepackaged solution
to log scanning problems. There are many areas where the
inside-control script can be made better, such as performance and
security. The following are some notes about inside-control, mostly
related to security issues.</p><p>In order for a CGI to read the computer log files
/var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages, these have to be made
readable by all. This can be accomplished with the command
<b  >chmod +r /var/log/syslog</b>. This, however, is not
very secure as it gives anybody on the system permission to read
the computer log files. It would be much better to get the web
server to run inside-control with a particular group permission,
and then make the log files belong to that group.</p><p>After reading the article, one could conclude it is essential
that a firewall also runs a web server, as inside-control needs to
read the firewall log files. In fact, putting a web server on a
firewall is very insecure: ideally a firewall should run no
d&aelig;mon service, and all maintenance should be done at the
console. When there is a need for remote administration, the only
service that may be installed on the firewall is
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>, the secure shell. Running
inside-control is still possible by setting up a separate web
server within the internal network that also acts as a syslog
server for the firewall.</p><p>Firewall logs can fill up a partition pretty quickly. In
order to avoid having a clogged hard disk on the firewall (which
could lead to a malfunctioning internet connection), depending on
the amount of traffic you want to log, you have to allow for a
large log file space. For high data volume services (typically
HTTP, FTP, SMTP, NetBIOS, LPD and database services) I would advise
setting up a second hard disk of at least 20GB in size, with just
one partition mounted on /var/log. Also keep in mind that the
script needs some error-checking code on critical steps like
opening a file.</p><p>Finally, there is a lot of room for improvement everywhere in
the script and especially in the main loop. One can use much more
data from each log line than is discussed here. However, it is
always a good idea to not show too many details; otherwise, the
whole point of having an automated log scanner is defeated. If you
display all available details, you end up having to look for
suspicious entries in an unmanageably high volume of traffic
log.</p></div></div>
