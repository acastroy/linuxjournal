One of the oldest and most full-featured Web community systems
is also among the hardest to install. Reuven gets you started as
a Slash Webmaster with advice on mod_perl and other prerequisites.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1305580.0x13fd3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The popularity of Weblogs, also known as blogs, has been growing for
several years and shows no signs of letting up. Although many
Webloggers continue to record their thoughts using third-party
services, such as LiveJournal and Blogger,
running a Weblog on your own server is becoming easier to do. Over the
last few months, we have looked at several different packages that
provide this functionality, including COREBlog, a Zope
product, and Blosxom, a set of CGI programs written in Perl.
</p><p>
Last month, we looked at a slightly different type of system
for Weblogs when we examined XOOPS. XOOPS, like its cousins
PHPNuke and PostNuke, allows users to create content management
and on-line communities as well as administer users and
groups. XOOPS makes it easy to give each user on a system his or her
own personal Weblog.
</p><p>
As popular as XOOPS may be, the undisputed
granddaddy of community software is Slash, which
powers the popular Slashdot.org and use.perl.org
Web sites. Slash primarily is used to
disseminate news articles and comments, but it has
a powerful Weblog feature that is available to
every user on the system. Some would argue that
Slashdot itself is a community-authored Weblog, an
argument I also find somewhat convincing. Best of all, this Weblog feature is
combined into other elements of the site. Thus, when
you see a particularly insightful or insipid
comment from another user, you immediately can view
that user's journal to learn more.
</p><p>
This month, we look at the installation and configuration of a
simple Slash site, with built-in support for users and Weblogs, or
journals, as they are called in Slash lingo. Next month, we will take a closer look
at the Weblog functionality available on Slash, as well as how to
configure and change it to suit our particular needs.

Infrastructure</h2></div></div><p>
The main distribution and discussion site for Slash is
Slashcode. As I
write this in early April 2004, the most recent posting is
titled, &ldquo;Making Slash Install Friendly&rdquo;, in which the author
asks if there are clear and simple directions for installing Slash.
Unfortunately, the answer appears to be no.
This is the case for several reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Slash documentation and instructions point most people to the
officially released .tar.gz packages, and these packages are more than two years out of date.
</p></li><li><p>
The latest CVS version is freely available and up to date but
potentially unstable, unless you know which tagged version to grab.
</p></li><li><p>
The installation is a fairly manual process, with room for error at
several critical points.
</p></li><li><p>
The documentation for Slash is somewhat lacking in quality.
</p></li><li><p>
Even if you get a recent, working copy of the code installed, full
Slash installation requires installing mod_perl, Template Toolkit,
MySQL and a number of other Perl modules and standalone tools, each
having its own
slightly odd and nonstandard options.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you are an expert with mod_perl, MySQL and Apache, installing
Slash is a slightly annoying but doable process. If you are less
than an expert, the results probably are worthwhile, but you
should expect to learn quite a bit about each of these technologies
along the way. You may find yourself turning to the IRC channel
and Web site for support and ideas.
</p><p>
The first step in installing Slash is to install Apache, mod_perl and
MySQL. Any modern version of MySQL works fine; the real problems
are with Apache and mod_perl, which can be tricky for first-timers to
install. Luckily, this part of the installation process has not
changed significantly over the years, meaning that you can follow the
MySQL, Apache and mod_perl installation instructions at the
InstallSlash site (see the on-line Resources section). If
neither Perl nor expat are installed on your system, you should follow
the InstallSlash instructions for those as well. Remember that on
Red Hat and Fedora systems, you need to install not only the
expat RPM but the expat-devel RPM too. You also need to
define a MySQL database into which site information can be stored; by
default, this is called slashdb.
</p><p>
A major source of trouble when compiling Apache and mod_perl is the
need to define EVERYTHING=1. This activates all of mod_perl's
hooks, allowing mod_perl to override all of Apache's default
behavior, including authentication, authorization, URL rewriting and
logging. Without defining EVERYTHING=1, mod_perl can generate
only content. If your system came with mod_perl installed, it probably
was not compiled with EVERYTHING=1 defined, meaning that you need to
compile it again by yourself.
</p><p>
The Slash instructions also advise system administrators to set
PERL_MARK_WHERE=1 when compiling, although the mod_perl code and
documentation indicate this directive removes most undefined value
warnings from the error log. I ignored this suggestion and used Slash
on my existing mod_perl installation, and I did not notice any ill
effects.
</p><p>
Finally, you should install the Bundle::Slash package from CPAN (a
worldwide network of servers containing freely available Perl modules
and documentation) on your system, using the automatic CPAN tools.
Actually, Bundle::Slash does not contain any code; it lists the
modules you need in order to run Slash. In this way, it saves you
from having to remember (and type in) all of the Slash-related modules
that must be installed.
You can install these modules while logged in as root by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Slash'
</pre>
</p><p>
If you never have used CPAN before, you will be asked to define a
number of CPAN-related parameters, including
the closest CPAN archive from which you can retrieve modules. This
can be a bit tricky the first time, although you probably can accept
the defaults without suffering any consequences.
</p><p>
One complicated part about installing these CPAN modules is DBIx::Password,
which asks for some site-specific information when it is
installed. The InstallSlash directions indicate what you should type
in response to the prompts. If you decide to change values for reasons
of security or personal taste, be sure to remember what names you
used.
</p><p>
The most difficult part of the Bundle::Slash download is the Template
Toolkit installation. Template Toolkit is a popular and powerful
templating system for mod_perl, and it is used to display the various
pages within a Slash site in a consistent and efficient manner.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1305580.0x13fde48"></a>
Retrieving a Tagged Version from CVS</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you need to download and install the Slash code
itself. The InstallSlash instructions walk you through the download
and installation process for the latest packaged version (2.2.6),
which is on SourceForge. However, as I indicated above, a great deal
of development has happened in the two years since 2.2.6 was released,
and those improvements are available only in the CVS version. You
can retrieve the latest version from CVS and save it in a directory named
slash with the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:
&#8618;/cvsroot/slashcode co -r T_2_3_0_148 slash
</pre>
</p><p>
At the same time, checking out the latest CVS version from SourceForge
has its own pitfalls, because you run the risk of installing code
recently checked in but not tested.
The best solution is to use a tagged version. As experienced CVS
developers know, each file in CVS has its own revision number, such as
1.5 or 2.8 or 3.1.1.2. These revision numbers reflect the revision of
the individual file and have nothing to do with the overall project.
Thus, although a software project might be released to the public as
version 2.0, the individual files almost certainly do not have
revision numbers of 2.0. To assign a collective name (or number) to
the current state of all files in a project, you must use tags,
sometimes known as symbolic revisions. Assuming that you have write
privileges, you can tag all of the files in the current directory
release-2-0 with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs tag release-2-0
</pre>
</p><p>
Tags cannot contain certain characters, including periods
and commas. This is why we needed to use a hyphen rather than a
period to indicate release 2.0 of our software.
This raises the question of which tag you can or should retrieve. In
the case of Slash, the code is moving slowly toward the 2.3.0
release, and the developers have standardized on tags that look like
T_2_3_0_XXX, where T stands for tested and XXX is incremented
with each new tag. As of this writing, the latest tag is
T_2_3_0_148; it can be retrieved with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:
&#8618;/cvsroot/slashcode co -r T_2_3_0_148 slash
</pre>
</p><p>
This command creates a directory named slash and puts all of the
Slash-related code, libraries and documentation into it.
Particularly helpful is the INSTALL file, which is an up-to-date
version of the directions designed to work with the CVS version
you just checked out. I followed the directions in this file, typing
<tt  >make install</tt>
to install all of the Slash components. A message from the
installation procedure indicates what command to add to the end of the
Apache configuration file. This ensures that Apache includes the
appropriate Perl modules at startup, reducing mod_perl's memory
footprint and execution time significantly.
</p><p>
One of the nice things about Slash is that it can
handle multiple sites easily using the same code. That is, if you decide
you want to have separate on-line communities for Perl, Python,
Tcl and Ruby, Slash can handle this for you. Each community
needs its own hostname, but they can be totally distinct from
one another.
In other words, installing a Slash site is a separate procedure from
installing the Slash software. Once the software is installed,
in /usr/local/slash by default, you can create a new site by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/slash/bin/install-slashsite -u USER
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1305580.0x13fe268"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Here, USER is the same virtual user you created back when you
installed DBIx::Password. By default, this user is virtslash.
install-slashsite asks several more questions, including the
administrator user name and password, and then tells you to stop
and start Apache with the apachectl program, typically installed in
/usr/local/apache/sbin. You should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> use apachectl's
restart command. Especially when working with mod_perl, you should
always stop Apache, pause a few seconds to allow the processes to exit
completely, and then start it again.
</p><p>
When I tried to run <tt  >install-slashsite</tt>, I
discovered that at least one CPAN module (LWP::Parallel::UserAgent)
was missing. It did not take too long to install it, but I was
frustrated to discover that neither Bundle::Slash nor make install
noticed or fixed this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1305580.0x13fe478"></a>
A Simple Slash Site</h2></div></div><p>
Your Slash site now is ready for use. On my machine, named
chaim-weizmann on my private home network, I was able to view my
site by going to http://chaim-weizmann.
</p><p>
Of course, a newly installed Slash site is not very exciting. If you
log in using the administrator user name and password you gave to
install-slashsite, you are given a number of options and menus
that provide a fair amount of control over the system. Many of the
menus are hard to find, and it takes some time before a new Slash
administrator will understand where different changes are
made, either on the Web site or in the on-disk templates and
programs. A good introduction to Slash-site maintenance,
slashguide.pod, is in the docs directory that comes with the CVS
version of Slash.
</p><p>
But, if you are at all familiar with the original Slashdot site, you
should be able to start posting stories and soliciting comments right
away. While logged in as the site administrator, click on the New
link at the top of the home page. Enter a topic,
title, department, intro copy (displayed on the home page) and
extended copy (displayed on the individual story page). You even
can set up a poll or link a story to an existing poll. Once the story is
approved, it is visible to the entire world. Visitors to the site
optionally can
be allowed to comment and even can act as moderators.
Indeed, the community moderation and meta-moderation of Slash
stories is one of the most intriguing ideas that Slash has brought to
the table.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Slash is more difficult to install than any of the other packages we
have discussed to date. This is partly due to the authors' choice of
technology, because mod_perl inherently is more difficult to install
than is PHP, used by XOOPS, or Zope. At the same time, Slash
provides more community and Weblog functions than the other packages,
is known to handle a high load and continues to be maintained at a
fairly high level.
</p><p>
If you aren't afraid to get your hands dirty, and if you want the
functionality the Slashdot site provides, Slash may be a
good choice for Weblogs written by a community or by individuals.
Next month, we will look at the personal journals that Slash allows
people to make, along with the friend system that allows people to
categorize other users on the system, creating a virtual community
that reflects the real world.
