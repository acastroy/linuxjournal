Build and test both the Linux and Microsoft
Windows versions of your project without rebooting.
With the free tools MinGW and Wine, you might even
call Win32 a cross-platform
API.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea6580.0xf9e240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like most people who read <i  >Linux Journal</i>, I am a rabid
fan of all things Linux, GNU and open source. I run
Linux on all of my personal machines, program on
them, play on them and evangelize to others whenever
possible. But, a large portion of the programming jobs
out there involve writing applications for an
operating system from Redmond, Washington.
</p><p>
For my job, I've had to write some smaller applications
for the Microsoft Windows platform. Because speed of
execution was an issue, I was going to have to write
them in C, directly using the Win32 API. It occurred
to me that if I was going to be using a standard
language such as C, I might be able to develop in
my nice and cozy Linux home.
</p><p>
This article is a short guide on developing an
application for Windows completely within a Linux
environment. I give a short introduction to
Windows programming and step through compiling and
testing a sample program. I also discuss
Wine to simplify porting Windows source code to Linux.

Win32 Programming</h2></div></div><p>
For those of us raised on the wholesome nutrition of
a UNIX-style process abstraction, the Windows model
might seem downright heretical.
The Windows model is a preemptive, multitasking, multithreaded,
message-passing operating system. I'm limiting
myself here to NT and its derivatives, 2000 and XP. All processes are considered
threads by the operating system. This makes the process context slightly
lighter than the traditional heavyweight process model used in UNIX-like
operating systems.
As a consequence of this everything-is-a-thread model,
however, everything sits in global memory address space.
With the correct permissions and the correct address, one program could
twiddle another program's bits.
</p><p>
Another consequence of this is data structures created by the
kernel don't sit at any fixed address. This means it is up to the
user program to lock down the associated memory before using any global
data structures, such as graphic contexts. You also
must remember to unlock these structures once you are done with them, or they
may help cause memory fragmentation.
</p><p>
Listing 1, available from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP
site (see the on-line Resources section), is a basic Hello World program. Most of it is
boilerplate, and only the portion within the switch
statement is of any real interest. It does seem
like quite a bit of code for a basic program, but that
is the problem with using a low-level API. A
good comparison on Linux would be writing code for
X using Xt.
</p><p>
Instead of a main() function, a Windows GUI program starts at
WinMain(). It's in this function that your program does all of its
initialization. Part of this initialization includes defining the
window class for the main window and associating a callback function for
it. Next, create the main window and show it on the desktop. Control
then passes to the message loop, and the callback function processes
the messages that are sent to the main window.
</p><p>
A good quick introduction to writing Windows programs
is available from winprog.org (see Resources).
The authors of this Web site offer a good FAQ and
a fairly good tutorial covering all of the basics.
Of course, the bible for Windows programming is
the massive book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Windows Programming</em></span>, by Charles
Petzold. If you can't find what you need in this tome,
you always can use it to beat the information
out of your friendly neighbourhood Windows guru.

Cross-Compiling</h2></div></div><p>
One of the amazing things about GCC is that it has been ported
to so many different platforms and operating systems. A great gift that
comes from this is the ability to compile binaries on one platform that
are destined
for a completely different one. I regularly compile binaries
for Solaris or Windows on my Linux laptop. This is an amazing advantage,
allowing development to occur in a familiar, comfortable environment.
</p><p>
The purest way to set up is to go back
to the source (see Resources). This way you can
compile code with the exact settings and for the
exact platform you want.
Thankfully, this work has already been done. The
good people at the MinGW Project maintain a port of
GCC for compiling Windows binaries. This includes all
of the associated files, such as the headers. The sources
are available here along with binary tarballs. These
programs also have been packaged for RPM-based and
deb-based distributions. If you are running Debian,
you can use apt-get to retrieve the mingw32 and
mingw32-runtime packages. If you are running testing or
unstable, you also should grab mingw32-binutils.
</p><p>
Most of the compilation options in GCC are available here in MinGW, along
with a few extras. If you simply compile a program without any extra
options, it can be run from the console. This is what you would do
if you wanted to write a small, simple program that did not need a GUI.
Because this is Windows, we want a GUI program, so we write all of
the required boilerplate we saw above and add the
<tt  >-mwindows</tt> option to
the compilation command. This sets up the macros and library links
you need in order to compile a standard Windows executable. If you decide to
write a more complicated Windows program that uses some other Windows'
feature,
you need to add in the libraries explicitly that you
want linked.
</p><p>
In Windows you can define resources for your program. These include such items
as menus, bitmaps and text strings, among others. These resources
are defined in a separate file and need to be compiled separately
before being linked to your executable. That job falls to the program
mingw-windres, which creates an object file you subsequently
can link to your executable.
</p><p>
To compile our simple example program shown in Listing 1, we use
the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mingw-gcc -o example1.exe example.c -mwindows
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea6580.0xf9ea80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Replace the command <tt  >mingw-gcc</tt> with whatever the package maintainer
called the compiler executable for your package. Presto, you now
have a Windows program ready for the world. Or is it?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea6580.0xf9ebe0"></a>
Debugging with Wine</h2></div></div><p>
Wine is the other great boon for developers who need to write programs for the
Windows platform. The massive amount of work that has gone
into Wine by its developers is phenomenal. This great program allows you to run Windows programs from
within Linux.
The upshot to this is we now can run our freshly
compiled program and see if it actually works as advertised. To do this,
use the command <tt  >wine example1.exe</tt>,
and you should see the
window appear on your desktop (Figure 1). When you set up Wine, you
have the options of windows being managed by your window manager,
not managed or displayed on their own desktop. This affects how the
window looks when you run it. What you see in Figure 1 is an unmanaged
application.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7128f1.large.jpg"><img src="7128f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Example Application Running Unmanaged under Wine
</p></div></div><p>
If you weren't lucky enough to have typed your program perfectly,
you may need to do some debugging to figure out what has gone wrong. Wine
can be a great asset here. The option --debugmsg
[debugchannel]
outputs the results from one or more debug channels within Wine. Examples
of the available debug channels are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
relay: writes a log message every time a Win32 function is called.
</p></li><li><p>
win: tracks Windows messages.
</p></li><li><p>
all: tracks all messages.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Don't use all unless you really need it. The amount of output
quickly can overwhelm even the most detail-obsessed programmer. A complete
list of available debug channels can be found on the Wine site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea6580.0xf9f210"></a>
Compiling a Native Version for Linux</h2></div></div><p>
We now have a wonderful, working, bug-free program that
runs under Windows. Considering that all of the work was done under Linux,
wouldn't it be nice if we also could have our program run under Linux?
The good folks at the Wine Project have come to the rescue
again. Part of the project includes winelib, a library that provides
the interface to Linux for your Windows source code. In order to use
this functionality, you need to install the wine-devel package for
your distribution. If you installed from source, the required files
already should be available.
</p><p>
Included in the wine-devel package is a Perl script called winemaker. This
script is designed to go through your source files and directories
and make the required changes to get it to compile correctly against
winelib on Linux. Things it checks include filename case and line ending
characters. In addition, it replaces file path back slashes with forward slashes and
does many other things. By default, it backs up any source files it needs
to change. It converts your project to winelib, making all
kinds of automagic changes. To compile, you simply run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
winemaker .
./configure --with-wine=/path/to/wine
make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea6580.0xf9f420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to create a Linux executable. The dot you see above is there on purpose.
You hand in the path where winemaker can find the source files it needs
to analyze; here, the files are in the current directory.
</p><p>
In our case, our sample doesn't have any project files, and winemaker
thinks this is a bit of a problem. We can do the steps
involved simply by hand. Instead of executing
<tt  >mingw-gcc</tt> to compile our program,
we use <tt  >winegcc</tt> with the exact same command-line parameters. This
creates a file ending in .so and a shell script to handle the
program execution. We now have our Windows source code compiled and
running under Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea6580.0xf9f630"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope I've been able to convince some of the Windows developers out
there that they can work effectively from within Linux. With GCC
allowing compilation of an executable for Windows, and Wine providing
great support in running and debugging, there is no real reason to boot
up Windows in most cases. The only reason would be if your favourite IDE
didn't run correctly under Wine, but then you always could volunteer to
fix that problem, right?
</p><p>
As this was only a short introduction, I did not cover support for MFC
or the creation of DLLs. Both of these topics are discussed in
more detail at WineHQ and the MinGW site.
