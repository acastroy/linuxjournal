To keep your FTP site secure, stick to anonymous access only and
run an FTP d&aelig;mon with minimal complexity.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2b40348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Can you believe that in nearly four years of Paranoid Penguin columns,
I've never talked about how to configure FTP services? This month I
fix that, using my new favorite FTP server, Chris Evans' excellent
vsftpd (Very Secure FTP D&aelig;mon). Because my space here is limited and the best use
of FTP is anonymous FTP, we focus on anonymous FTP. The FTP
protocol's use of clear-text authentication makes it a terrible choice
for anything but anonymous file transfer. But anonymous FTP is
still plenty useful.
</p><p>
vsftpd is increasingly popular and is
included with recent versions of Debian, SuSE, Fedora, Red Hat and other
Linux distributions. This inclusion probably is because vsftpd provides a unique
combination of security and convenience. It is easy to get up and
running in a hurry, without having to make ugly security-vs.-expedience
trade-offs.
</p><p>
Chris Evans created vsftpd with security as a
central design goal, and its track record so far
is impressive. In the nearly four years it's been
available, as of this writing, vsftpd has had zero
significant security vulnerabilities. Regardless
of whether that's still true by the time you read
this article, it speaks to vsftpd's excellent design
philosophy, which borrows from OpenBSD's &ldquo;secure by
default, extra features disabled by default, minimal
complexity overall&rdquo; motto.
</p><p>
How minimalist is vsftpd? Its entire source tree is just over 1MB in
size, fully uncompressed. The vsftpd executable itself is 80K.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2b405b0"></a>
Getting and Installing vsftpd</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned, vsftpd now is a standard package on many Linux
distributions. The usual advantages of binary packages apply: convenience,
easy patching and minimal impact on other system software. In Debian,
SuSE, Fedora and Red Hat, the package you need predictably is named
vsftpd. It has no particularly exotic dependencies. Most users
probably will be perfectly happy with their distribution's stock vsftpd
package.
</p><p>
If your distribution of choice doesn't provide a binary package for
vsftpd, or if you need a later version than the one your
distribution provides, compile vsftpd from its source
code tarball, which is available at <a href="http://vsftpd.beasts.org" target="_self">vsftpd.beasts.org</a>. The build
process is decidedly old school.
If you aren't already, become root.
Then, unpack the tarball and change your working directory to its root, like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# tar -xf vsftpd-1.2.1.tar.gz; cd vsftpd-1.2.1
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, enter the command <tt  >make</tt> without arguments. If it succeeds, there
should be a vsftp executable in the current directory.
Make sure the user nobody exists; if it doesn't, create it.
vsftpd runs on this account.
</p><p>
Create the directory /usr/share/empty if it doesn't exist already. It
should be owned by root and be neither group- nor world-writable&mdash;it will be used as the default vsftpd chroot jail.
</p><p>
Create a home directory for the anonymous FTP user. SuSE conventionally
uses /srv/ftp, and other distributions use /var/ftp, but it can be
whatever you like. Again, this directory should be owned by root
and should not be writable by anyone else.
</p><p>
Create an anonymous FTP user account, such as
ftp, and make sure its home directory is set to
the one you created in the previous step. Your system
already may have such an account.
The anonymous ftp user should not be able to
write in its home directory, and it should never own
any files or directories.
</p><p>
Now you're ready to copy vsftpd and the vsftpd(8) and
vsftpd.conf(5) man pages into more useful locations, so enter the
command <tt  >make install</tt>.
Manually copy the sample vsftpd.conf file into /etc.
</p><p>
If you want to run vsftpd as a standalone d&aelig;mon, create a startup
script for vsftpd in /etc/init.d. Otherwise, configure either inetd
or xinetd to start it up as needed (see the Standalone D&aelig;mon
vs. inetd/xinetd section).
</p><p>
If you're running vsftpd as a standalone d&aelig;mon, enable the startup
script with <tt  >chkconfig</tt> if you use an RPM-based Linux distribution
or with <tt  >update-rc.d</tt> if you run Debian GNU/Linux.
Alternatively, if you install vsftpd from an RPM or deb package, all these
steps are executed automatically, with the probable exception of the
last one. Did I mention that binary packages are much more convenient?
Some distributions require manual intervention to enable newly installed
packages. For example, on my SuSE 9.0 system, although the SuSE vsftpd
RPM automatically installed /etc/init.d/vsftpd, I had to issue
the commands <tt  >chkconfig --add vsftpd</tt> and
<tt  >chkconfig --level
35 vsftpd on</tt> to enable the script.

vsftpd's Documentation</h2></div></div><p>
Before I begin a discussion of vsftpd that
focuses narrowly on running it as a standalone
d&aelig;mon serving up only anonymous FTP, I should point
out some valuable, much more complete, sources of
vsftpd documentation. First, vsftpd comes with an
EXAMPLE/ directory containing sample configurations
for a variety of FTP scenarios, including running
standalone, running with xinetd, serving anonymous
users only and serving local users.
If you installed vsftpd from source code, EXAMPLE is a subdirectory
of your vsftpd source code tarball. If
you installed vsftpd from a binary package, it's probably been
copied to your system somewhere under /user/share/doc. It is
/usr/share/doc/packages/vsftpd/EXAMPLE on SuSE systems.
</p><p>
As I mentioned in the previous section, vsftpd has man pages,
vsftpd(8) and vsftpd.conf(5). Finally, the default (sample)
vsftpd.conf file itself is well commented. It doesn't contain
all vsftpd options, but it does illustrate the most commonly used ones.
I've successfully gotten vstpd to work several times with only minimal
tweaking to the sample vsftpd.conf file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2b40d98"></a>
Standalone D&aelig;mon vs. inetd/xinetd</h2></div></div><p>
Before configuring vsftpd itself, you must decide whether to run
it as a standalone d&aelig;mon or by way of a super-server, inetd or
xinetd. In previous versions of vsftpd, its developer
recommended using it with xinetd due to xinetd's
logging and access-control features. However, vsftpd versions 1.2 and
later have native support for most of those features. For this reason,
Evans now recommends that vsftpd be run as a standalone d&aelig;mon.
In addition, a performance cost is associated with using inetd
or xinetd. The cost isn't warranted if your system is to be a
dedicated FTP server or if you anticipate FTP comprising a significant
percentage of your system's activity.
</p><p>
I'm going to take the liberty of using standalone d&aelig;mon examples for
the remainder of this article. vsftpd's included documentation amply
describes how to use vsftpd with inetd and xinetd; see the
example configurations included in vsftpd's EXAMPLE directory.
</p><p>
Interestingly, the vsftpd package that comes with SuSE 9 is preconfigured
to run from xinetd, while Debian 3.0's runs from inetd. This
is especially logical in the latter case, because Debian 3.0 comes with an
older version of vsftpd (1.0.0), but SuSE 9.0 uses vsftpd 1.2. The vsftpd
RPMs that come with Fedora and Red Hat install vsftpd as a standalone
d&aelig;mon. At any rate, there are two steps to converting vsftpd from
inet/xinetd startup to standalone startup.
</p><p>
First, as I mentioned in the Getting and Installing
vsftpd section, you must make sure you've got an enabled
startup script for vsftpd in /etc/init.d. The Fedora
Core 1 and SuSE 9.0 packages both provide and install
one; in SuSE's case it's present but disabled by
default, in favor of xinetd. If you used
Debian 3.0's vsftpd package or installed vsftpd
from source, however, you need to create your own
startup script. You also must create the corresponding links in
the directories for the runlevels at which you want
vsftpd to run, such as rc3.d and rc5.d. The last
step is easy to do automatically with <tt  >chkconfig</tt>
or <tt  >update-rc.d</tt>.
</p><p>
Second, you need either to disable vsftpd's xinetd file, by setting
<tt  >disable = yes</tt> in the file /etc/xinetd.d/vsftpd or to comment out vsftpd's
line in /etc/inetd.conf. Alternatively, you can disable inetd
or xinetd altogether, if vsftpd was the only important thing it
was starting.
</p><p>
Arguably, it's irresponsible of me to recommend that you enable an
application's startup script before you've fine-tuned that application's
security. In my opinion, enabling is one thing; you're fine so long as
you follow through and lock down the service before actually starting
it or rebooting your system.
</p><p>
Third, you need to make sure that in /etc/vsftpd.conf the parameter
listen is set to YES. This brings us to vsftpd configuration
proper.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2b411b8"></a>
Configuring vsftpd for Anonymous FTP</h2></div></div><p>
Actually, you may not need to do anything more to configure vsftpd
for secure anonymous FTP. Its default configuration settings permit only
anonymous FTP. What's more, no write commands of any kind are enabled
by default, and in recent versions of vsftpd, the d&aelig;mon chroots itself
to the directory /usr/share/empty whenever possible. This is one of the
things I love about vsftpd. It actually takes more work to loosen its
security than it does to tighten it down.
</p><p>
Assuming your distribution hasn't altered this default behavior, all
you need to do now is populate your anonymous FTP user account's home
directory with FTP content for people to download. On Debian 3.0, SuSE
9.0 and Fedora Core 1, the anonymous FTP user is ftp by default,
with a home directory of /srv/ftp for Debian and SuSE and /var/ftp in
the case of Fedora. If you installed vsftpd from source, the anonymous
FTP directory is whatever home directory you assigned to the anonymous
FTP user account you created.
Pay special attention to ownership and permissions when populating
your FTP directories. Defaults may or may not be appropriate, but at
least do a quick <tt  >ls -al</tt> now and then to see for
yourself.
</p><p>
Even though default settings suffice for many users, let's take
a closer look at the vsftpd.conf parameters most relevant to anonymous
FTP. By default, this file resides in /etc, but on Red Hat and Fedora
systems it resides in /etc/vsftpd/. Listing 1 shows a sample vsftpd.conf
file.

In practice, you'd never use a vsftpd.conf file exactly like Listing 1.
All parameters in it are, in fact, set to their default values. Rather,
this listing is meant as a quick reference. Let's discuss its parameters
in turn.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
listen: tells vsftpd to run as a d&aelig;mon rather than as a per-connection
process invoked as needed by inetd or xinetd. Default value is NO.
</p></li><li><p>
listen_address: specifies on which local IP address vsftpd should listen
for connections. The default is <tt  >""</tt> (null), signifying all local IP
addresses. If you want to run multiple virtual FTP servers, you
need to set this parameter in each virtual server's configuration file
(see the next section, Virtual Servers).
</p></li><li><p>
anonymous_enable: this parameter, whose default is YES, determines
whether vsftpd accepts anonymous logins. If set to YES or not set
at all, vsftpd accepts connections from the users anonymous
and ftp (the two are equivalent) without requiring a real password.
</p></li><li><p>
ftp_username: the name of the user account used for anonymous logins,
that is, FTP logins as anonymous and ftp. This account must
exist in /etc/passwd and should have a valid home directory that is not
owned by the user account; the default is ftp.
</p></li><li><p>
anon_root: the directory vsftpd should chroot into for anonymous
logins. This defaults to the home directory of the anonymous ftp
user account (see ftp_username), but you can use this parameter to set
a different anonymous FTP root. Either way, this directory should not
be owned by the anonymous ftp user.
</p></li><li><p>
write_enable: unless this parameter is set to YES, no user may upload
any files under any circumstances, regardless of other settings in
vsftpd.conf. Its default value is NO.
</p></li><li><p>
anon_upload_enable: if this parameter and write_enable are both set
to YES, anonymous users are permitted to upload files into
directories on which the anonymous user account has write permission.
</p></li><li><p>
anon_mkdir_write_enable: if this parameter and write_enable are both
set to YES, anonymous users are permitted to create new
directories within directories on which the anonymous user account has
write permission.
</p></li><li><p>
anon_other_write_enable: if this parameter and write_enable are both
set to YES, anonymous users are permitted to delete and rename
directories within directories on which the anonymous user account has
write permission.
</p></li><li><p>
anon_world_readable_only: if set to YES, this parameter forbids anonymous
users from downloading any non-world-readable file. Most useful if
anonymous users are able to upload files you don't want other
anonymous users to download.
</p></li><li><p>
anon_max_rate: specifies the maximum data transfer rate, in bytes per
second, that anonymous users can use. The default value is 0, which means
unlimited.
</p></li><li><p>
idle_session_timeout: the maximum amount of time, in seconds, allowed
to transpire between FTP commands until a session is closed forcibly
by the server. Default value is 300, but if you're worried about
denial-of-service attacks, you may want to set this lower.
</p></li><li><p>
ascii_download_enable: if set to YES, this allows users to perform
ASCII-mode downloads, as opposed to binary-mode. The default is NO
because ASCII-mode is seldom if ever necessary, and
it's much less efficient, so much so as to represent a potential vector
for denial-of-service attacks.
</p></li><li><p>
ascii_upload_enable: ASCII-mode uploads, on the other hand, are sometimes
necessary for such things as scripts. This parameter's default value is,
nonetheless, NO.
</p></li><li><p>
connect_from_port_20: in active-mode FTP sessions, whenever a user
downloads anything, including directory listings, the server initiates
a new connection back to the client, conventionally originating from
the server's TCP port 20. By default, however, vsftpd originates such
connections from a higher, non-privileged port, in order to avoid having
to run as root. To change this default behavior, in case your FTP users
connect from behind proxies or firewalls that don't expect such behavior,
set this parameter to YES.
</p></li><li><p>
port_enable: set this to NO to disable PORT commands, which
effectively disables active-mode FTP altogether. Default is YES.
</p></li><li><p>
hide_ids: if set to YES, replaces the owner and group fields in all
directory listing output to ftp and ftp, respectively. Personally,
I think this can be a useful bit of obscurity when used on public FTP
servers, but the default is NO.
</p></li><li><p>
log_ftp_protocol: if set to YES, turns on per-command logging, FTP
protocol commands, that is, triggered by but distinct from
FTP user-space commands. Invaluable for troubleshooting.
</p></li><li><p>
syslog_enable: normally vsftpd writes log messages to
/var/log/vsftpd.log. Setting this parameter to YES (its default is NO)
sends those messages instead to the system's syslog service, using the
FTPD facility.
</p></li><li><p>
max_per_ip: specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections
permitted from a single source IP address. Limiting this
may seem like a good idea&mdash;the default is 0, which means
unlimited&mdash;but doing so has a disproportionate effect on users connecting from behind
NAT/SPAT firewalls, which cause multiple users to appear to originate
from the same source IP address.
</p></li><li><p>
cmds_allowed: specifies a comma-separated list of allowed FTP commands;
default value is <tt  >""</tt> (null), which means unlimited.
Only
FTP protocol-level commands may be specified, not the commands commonly
accepted by FTP client software packages. For example, to allow clients
only to list files, change working directories and download files,
you'd use
<tt  >cmds_allowed=USER,LIST,NLST,CWD,RETR,PORT,QUIT</tt>. The Web site
<a href="http://www.nsftools.com/tips/RawFTP.htm" target="_self">www.nsftools.com/tips/RawFTP.htm</a> is a useful reference for these
commands.
</p></li><li><p>
local_root: this specifies an empty, root-owned directory to which vsftpd
chroots itself any time it doesn't need access to other parts of the
filesystem. Default value is /usr/share/empty.
</p></li><li><p>
nopriv_user: specifies the non-privileged user vsftpd runs as whenever
possible. vsftpd obviously needs to be root when doing things
like binding to TCP port 21. It demotes itself as soon as it can,
however,
in order to lessen the chance of a buffer-overflow vulnerability or other
process-hijacking event leading to root compromise.
</p></li><li><p>
ftpd_banner: banner message to display when FTP clients attempt
to connect. Default message is hard-coded into vsftpd; in v1.2.0,
it's simply (vsFTPd 1.2.0). Alternatively, you can use the parameter
banner_file to specify a text file containing your banner message.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The vsftpd.conf(5) man page explains these and many other parameters
you can use. Believe it or not, I've only scratched the surface here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2f3ab10"></a>
Virtual Servers</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to have multiple virtual FTP servers residing on the same
physical host, one with multiple IP addresses,
vsftpd can do this easily. All you need to do is run multiple instances of the
vsftpd d&aelig;mon, each with its own vsftpd.conf file specifying on which IP
address to listen and which directory to use as its anonymous root.
</p><p>
For example, suppose I've got two IP addresses assigned to my machine,
1.2.3.4 and 1.2.3.5, registered in DNS to the names knusper and rover,
respectively. In that case, I could have two configuration files for
vsftpd, say, /etc/vsftpd.knusper and /etc/vsftpd.rover. Listings 2 and
3 show these files.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2f3ad20"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

/etc/vsftpd.knusper</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

connect_from_port_20=YES
anonymous_enable=YES
anon_root=/srv/ftp/knusper

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a48580.0x2f3af30"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

anonymous_enable=NO
ftpd_banner=Private FTP at rover.wiremonkeys.org. Strangers-B-gone.
# DANGER: don't use the following unless you know what you're doing!
local_enable=YES
</pre></div><p>
Notice my possibly foolish use of the local_enable parameter in
Listing 3. It's dangerous to set this to YES, because FTP logon credentials are
sent in clear text. You never want to expose real system credentials
to eavesdropping, especially if your server is Internet-connected.
The real reason I show it here is to illustrate that because each virtual
server uses its own configuration file, you can specify completely
different behaviors for each. One virtual server may have a public
uploads directory that anonymous users write to, whereas another
may be a strictly read-only FTP site. Conversely, you need to take care
that settings you consider to be important in preserving overall system
security are set consistently between different virtual servers running
on the same machine.
</p><p>
Besides creating different configuration files for each virtual FTP
server you want vsftpd to serve up, you also need to alter your startup
script accordingly. The startup script on my sample server, represented
by Listings 2 and 3, would need something equivalent to these two lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.knusper
vsftpd /etc/vsftpd.rover
</pre>
</p><p>
If you run Red Hat or Fedora, this already has been taken care of for
you. The /etc/init.d/vsftpd script included with those distributions'
vsftpd RPM packages automatically parses the directory /etc/vsftpd for
as many configuration files as you care to put there, so long as the
filename of each ends with .conf. This strikes me as an excellent bit of
foresight on the part of the Red Hat team.
</p><p>
That's all you need to know about setting up a simple and secure anonymous
FTP server with vsftpd. As I mentioned, I've only covered a subset
of what vsftpd is capable of doing. Despite its minimalist design
philosophy, this is a powerful FTP server indeed. Fortunately, it's
also well documented, so it's really no cop-out for me to refer
you to the vsftpd.conf(5) man page and the EXAMPLE/ directory for
information on the many other uses of vsftpd.
