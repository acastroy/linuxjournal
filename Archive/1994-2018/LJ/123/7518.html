<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #123, July 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Roland Dreier</b></span> and the folks at OpenIB.org have
produced a rough cut of an <span   class="bold"><b>InfiniBand</b></span> stack,
including a low-level driver for <span   class="bold"><b>Mellanox
HCA</b></span> hardware;
upper-layer protocols such as IP-over-InfiniBand,
SCSI RDMA protocol, sockets direct protocol
(SDP), uDAPL and MPI; and accompanying user-space
utilities. The code itself is open source, but
Microsoft has intellectual property claims on SDP
and does not automatically allow it to be used
in open-source projects. As a result, Roland and the
others have split their InfiniBand stack into free
and encumbered packages, a decision that seems to satisfy
everybody for the moment.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has started a <span   class="bold"><b>SourceForge</b></span> project
for its <span   class="bold"><b>PRO/Wireless 2100</b></span> miniPCI network
adapter driver for Linux kernels in the 2.4 and
2.6 series. Although the firmware is binary-only,
the rest of the project seems to be in keeping with
open-source methods. A public mailing list serves to
connect developers, and new updates are published
frequently, so everyone can try them out and report
problems or suggest enhancements. Currently they've
classified the code as early beta, so various bugs
and missing features should be expected. At the same
time, the Intel developers intend to be particularly
sensitive to issues arising from interactions with
particular Linux distributions, so hopefully the
default installations of most distributions will
break in only known, documented ways.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Niraj Kumar</b></span> has ported <span   class="bold"><b>UFS1</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>UFS2</b></span> to Linux. UFS1 has been the native BSD
filesystem for a long time, and UFS2 is a recent
extension, adding such features as 64-bit block pointers
and extended file storage. Niraj's Linux port is
read-only at the moment, as work has just
begun. UFS2 itself is quite new, and even on the
BSD operating systems it does not yet support such things as
the GRUB bootloader. It is the default only on
FreeBSD systems; NetBSD still creates a normal FFS
filesystem by default. Originally derived from UFS1 by
<span   class="bold"><b>Kirk McKusick</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Poul-Henning Kamp</b></span>, UFS2 is undergoing
active development. Linux support apparently
will follow close upon its adoption by the BSDs.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Geng</b></span> has produced a GPLed device driver for the I2C-based
Videotext/Teletext decoder <span   class="bold"><b>SAA5246A</b></span>, providing the same interface as that of
the SAA5249 chip driver. Based in part on work by <span   class="bold"><b>Martin Buck</b></span>, Michael has
cleaned up the existing code and completed the work to the point that
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> has accepted it into the 2.6 tree as part of the official
kernel sources. As Michael points out, newer TV cards no longer include
these Teletex decoders and instead rely on the CPU to perform the same
function. When present, however, these chips appear to do a better job
and are worth supporting where possible.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Emulex</b></span> has decided to open source the driver
for its <span   class="bold"><b>LightPulse</b></span> Fibre Channel Adapter
family and has created a SourceForge project page
to accomplish this. The hope is to get the code
cleaned up and completed and have it accepted into
the 2.6 kernel tree. When a company decides to free
up the source code for one of its drivers, they
typically are given a warm batch of kudos from the
kernel developers, as well as comments, criticism
and patches from developers looking over the code
for the first time. In this case, <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff
Garzik</b></span> has done
the most probing analysis, offering a ton of feedback
to the Emulex developers. Apparently there are some
ugly bits in the code, as the Emulex folks had warned
in the announcement, but Emulex seems committed to
doing whatever cleanup is necessary to make the driver
acceptable to Andrew and the rest of the kernel folks.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kristian Soerensen</b></span> has been working recently
on <span   class="bold"><b>Umbrella</b></span>, a new security project for
handheld devices intended to help protect them
from viruses and other cracks. One of the main
features of Umbrella is its unambiguous configuration
system. All complexity has been eliminated, so it
is not possible for the user to mistakenly allow
undesired breaches.

The most important operating system you write applications for ain't

When you stop to think about it, you keep secrets from people when you
don't want them to know the truth. Secrets, even when legitimate and
necessary, as in genuine national-security cases, are what you might
call passive lies.

I figured yesterday I might as well see how hard it
would be to turn GtkTextView into a real editor.
</p><p>
I started with the three hundred lines of Python
and a fairly simple Glade file I made on Christmas
day. After two days of hacking, I have added
a thousand lines of code, and now this thing is
fairly usable. Yes, I'm now writing this log with
the new editor.
