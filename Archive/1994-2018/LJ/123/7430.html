Curious about .NET? Try out this useful
sample app that exercises the GUI and
XML-RPC features of Mono.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x181f298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Mono is Ximian's open-source implementation of Microsoft's .NET
development framework. .NET contains several different technologies: a set of
compilers for many different languages (including Microsoft's new
language, C#) that generates platform-independent bytecode; a virtual
machine known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR) that runs these
bytecodes; and a class library full of useful programs for performing
actions ranging from file I/O to GUI creation and operation.
</p><p>
The Mono
implementation includes a CLR that runs on Linux, BSD-based systems
(including Mac OS X) and Windows, plus compilers for C# and Basic. Mono
is a work-in-progress, and many parts of the .NET class library have
yet to be implemented, specifically the Windows.Forms group that
contains classes for working with the Windows GUI. However, the Mono
developers have released bindings for the GTK user-interface toolkit,
so cross-platform graphical applications can be constructed even
without 100% .NET compatibility. This article describes how to use
C#, Mono and Linux to write a useful program, MonoBlog, that can run
on any system that runs Mono and GTK. Some familiarity with Glade and
C# is assumed, but only at a basic level. Helpful tutorials can be
found in the on-line Resources section.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x181f3f8"></a>
Obtaining Mono</h2></div></div><p>
The Mono Web site
has instructions for
installing the system on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows platforms (see
Resources). You
also need two additional C# libraries, GTK#
and XmlRpcCS.
The systems that MonoBlog
runs on require the base GTK libraries, which are available on
most Linux systems. They probably need to be installed on Windows
and Mac OS X systems, however; packages can be found on the GTK Web site
(see Resources).
Instructions for installing these libraries can be found on their
respective Web pages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x181f500"></a>
MonoBlog, a Weblog Editor</h2></div></div><p>
MonoBlog is a Weblog editor that can add new posts to a Weblog and edit
old ones, as well as provide a way for a user to change
configuration settings. Most Weblog systems implement
a common base of functionality known as the MetaWeblog API. MonoBlog
uses this to communicate with a variety of different Weblog programs,
rather than write a separate back end for Movable Type, LiveJournal
or Radio Userland systems. The complete C# code for this example
is available on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site (see
Resources).
</p><p>
Figures 1 and 2 show the user interface of MonoBlog, created using
Glade on Linux. The main window in Figure 1 has text controls for
entering Weblog titles and the content, plus a series of buttons for
updating the Weblog, clearing the forms and quitting the program. The
expanse of white on the left-hand side is a GTKTreeView control, which
displays a list of older posts the user can click on in order to
update. The window shown in Figure 2 is a simple preferences panel
where users enter the information that allows MonoBlog to
communicate with their Weblogs.

Creating the GUI with libglade</h2></div></div><p>
One of GTK's useful features is libglade, a library that allows us to
construct a program's GUI by reading in the XML files created by Glade,
specifying the layout of the widgets in the code
itself. The GTK# binding includes this functionality, so building the
GUI is quite easy. At the start of MonoBlog, we import the GTK and
Glade namespaces with the <tt  >using</tt> statement. Then, in the
constructor, we have:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Application.Init();

Glade.XML gxml = new Glade.XML("monoblog.glade",
                               null, null);
gxml.Autoconnect(this);

Application.Run();
</pre>
</p><p>
The calls to the Application class are required in all GTK programs.
Application.Init() performs GTK initialization, and Application.Run()
passes control of the program to the GTK main loop, which watches for
events and reports signals back when they occur. The standard Glade.XML
constructor takes three arguments: a string containing the filename of
the Glade file, a string that tells the object the node in the Glade
tree where it should start building the interface and, finally, a string
that can be used to specify a translation domain for the Glade file in
question.
</p><p>
MonoBlog needs to have access to all the nodes in the XML
file, both the main window and the preferences panel. No
translation is required, so the second and third arguments are null.
The Autoconnect() method binds the object given as an argument with the
signal handlers and objects defined in the Glade file, allowing that
object to respond to events and manipulate widgets. As MonoBlog is a
small program, I have contained all the signal handling within the
main class. In larger, more complex systems, it might be advisable to
separate signal handling out into another class.
</p><p>
To access the widgets,
a special declaration is required. The widget must be declared as an
instance variable, using a custom attribute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Glade.Widget] GTKWidgetType widgetname;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x181fd40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
with <tt  >GTKWidgetType</tt> being replaced by the actual object type
concerned, and <tt  >widgetname</tt> being the name of the widget as
defined in the Glade file. After Autoconnect() returns, these widgets
can be used as if they had been created in the program itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x181fef8"></a>
Retrieving Old Entries</h2></div></div><p>
When the program loads, the first action it performs is to query the
Weblog and download the recent posts, displaying
them in the TreeView widget. The method getRecentPosts() in the
MonoBlog class handles this; it is called in the main constructor if
preferences exist, as the method needs to know about the Weblog it is
contacting. The MetaWeblog API provides a function call,
metaweblog.getRecentPosts, that returns a specified number of
old posts or as many as it can find if fewer posts exist than we desire.
</p><p>
The communication with the Weblog is straightforward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
XmlRpcRequest client = new XmlRpcRequest();
client.MethodName = "metaWeblog.getRecentPosts";
client.Params.Add(BlogID);
client.Params.Add(ServerUser);
client.Params.Add(ServerPass);
client.Params.Add(NumberOfPosts);
XmlRpcResponse response = client.Send(ServerURL);
</pre>
</p><p>
All that is required is to create a new XmlRpcRequest object, set the
required API method name, fill in the necessary arguments and send it
to the Weblog. The Weblog then returns a response, in this case an
array of posts, which is stored in the Value field of the
XmlRpcResponse object. Next, we need to update the GTKTreeView control.
</p><p>
In GTK 2.0 and above, this control uses a model-view-controller
approach. Here, then, we create a new model object and pass it to the
control:

<pre     class="programlisting">
System.Type[] ListTypes = new System.Type[3];
ListTypes[0] = typeof(string);
ListTypes[1] = typeof(string);
ListTypes[2] = typeof(string);
ListStore store = new ListStore(ListTypes);
treeview1.Model = store;
</pre>
</p><p>
This model object creates a table with three columns. The ListStore object needs to
be passed an array of Type objects; each item in the array corresponds
to the type of column. A Weblog post contains three items&mdash;a
title, the content of the post and a unique identifier&mdash;all of which
are strings, so here all the columns have a String type. The rest of
the method cycles through the array, populating the model:

<pre     class="programlisting">
TreeIter iter = new TreeIter ();
foreach (Hashtable post in results) {
  String title = (String) post ["title"];
  String postid = (String) post ["postid"];
  String description = (String) post ["description"];

  store.Append (out iter);
  store.SetValue (iter, 0, new GLib.Value(title));
  store.SetValue (iter, 1, new GLib.Value(postid));
  store.SetValue (iter, 2,
  new GLib.Value(description));
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This, by itself, isn't enough to display the titles in the tree.
For that, we include some code in the constructor, after the
call to getRecentPosts():

<pre     class="programlisting">
TreeViewColumn TitleCol = new TreeViewColumn();
CellRenderer TitleRenderer = new CellRendererText();
TitleCol.AddAttribute (TitleRenderer, "text", 0);
treeview1.AppendColumn (TitleCol);
</pre>
</p><p>
This adds a new column view to the tree. The AddAtrribute() method is
hooked to the title column of the model (the first) with the 0
argument. As all the user requires is to see the title of an entry in
the TreeView control; no other column views are needed. The
information, though, is stored in the model to make the program more
efficient.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x1820370"></a>
Editing Old Posts</h2></div></div><p>
When a user clicks on an entry, the desired result is for the program
to display the old entry in the text entry portions on the right-hand
side of the window. The MetaWeblog API has a method called
metaweblog.getPost that pulls posts from the Weblog.
As they already have been downloaded in the getRecentPosts() method,
the program can get the data from the model instead of communicating
with the Weblog again. The row_activated signal is bound to
the method SelectOldPost using Glade, so whenever an item is
double-clicked, this code runs:


<pre     class="programlisting">
public void SelectOldPost(System.Object obj, EventArgs e) {
  TreeSelection currentSelection = treeview1.Selection;
  TreeIter iter;
  TreeModel model = treeview1.Model;
  currentSelection.GetSelected (out model, out iter);
  String selected = (string) model.GetValue (iter, 1);
  String oldTitle = (string) model.GetValue(iter,0);
  String oldEntry = (string) model.GetValue(iter,2);

  TextBuffer buffer = textview1.Buffer;
  entry1.Text = oldTitle;
  buffer.SetText(oldEntry);

  OldPostID = selected;
  EditingOldPost = true;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This method obtains the current selected item in the GTKTreeView
control and uses an iterator to index into the model and find the
required values. It then fills in the text fields with this
information and updates two instance variables that are needed
when the user clicks on the Post button. If the program is updating an
older entry rather than creating a new entry, it needs to make a
different MetaWeblog API call, which needs the unique identifier of the
post. The variables OldPostID and EditingOldPost are updated to
reflect this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x18205d8"></a>
Updating the Weblog</h2></div></div><p>
The clicked signal on the Update button is bound to the method
OnUpdateClicked. This process is too long to reprint in full in this
article, but the operation is simple enough. First, it gets the text
from the two text controls and creates a hash table representation of
the post; this is required for the MetaWeblog API call. Depending on
whether the EditingOldPost flag is set, the method then sends an
XML-RPC request to the Weblog, using the
<tt  >metaweblog.newPost</tt> or
<tt  >metaweblog.editPost</tt> calls as appropriate. When the Weblog
returns a successful response, indicating that it has been updated, the
method finally clears the text forms and allows the user to start anew.
</p><p>
The other buttons on the main window, New Post and Quit, are short
snippets of code. Like the Post button, the clicked signals are bound
in MonoBlog. New Post is bound to a method that clears the text forms
and sets the EditingOldPost flag to false, allowing the user to start
over. Quit, as expected, exits MonoBlog using the
Application.Exit() GTK call.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x18207e8"></a>
Preferences</h2></div></div><p>
The .NET class library includes classes that handle reading
in preferences from an XML file. Listing 1 shows an example MonoBlog configuration
file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x18208f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. An Example XML Configuration File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
&lt;appSettings&gt;
&lt;add key="ServerURL"
value="http://www.test.com/mt-xmlrpc.cgi"/&gt;
&lt;add key="ServerUser" value="example"/&gt;
&lt;add key="ServerPass" value="password"/&gt;
&lt;add key="BlogID" value="1"/&gt;
&lt;add key="NumberOfPosts" value="10"/&gt;
&lt;/appSettings&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The method getConfig(), shown below, reads in these values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
private bool getConfig {
  try {
  AppSettingsReader config = new AppSettingsReader();
  ServerURL = (string) config.GetValue("ServerURL",
  typeof(string));

  ServerUser = (string)  config.GetValue("ServerUser",
  typeof(string));

  ServerPass = (string) config.GetValue("ServerPass",
  typeof(string));

  BlogID = (string) config.GetValue("BlogID",
  typeof(string));

  NumberOfPosts =  (string)
  config.GetValue("NumberOfPosts", typeof(string));

  catch(Exception problem) {
    return false;
    }
  return true;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The AppSettingsReader object, by default, looks for a configuration
file named executable.config, so here it opens a file
called monoblog.exe.config. Then, the GetValue() method is
used to determine the required preference values. MonoBlog calls this method
in its constructor before it attempts to query the Weblog for old
posts, so it has the required information. If the file does not
exist or if there is a problem reading the data, the method returns
false. The constructor only calls getRecentPosts() if this method
returns true, preventing garbage values from being used.
</p><p>
Updating the preferences is a more complex task. First, the
Preferences option in the main window's menubar is bound to the method
OnPrefsActivate, using Glade's Menu Editor. This brings up the dialog
shown in Figure 2 and fills in the fields with the current values, if
any are defined. When the user clicks on the OK button in this dialog,
MonoBlog updates the variables and writes the new information back out
to the configuration file. Unfortunately, the .NET class library
doesn't have classes that update configuration
files. As the configuration here is fairly simple, I wrote a method
called saveConfig() that opens the default configuration file and
writes the updated information back out to disk using a series of
Write() statements. This could be replaced with a more sophisticated
method that builds a proper XML document, but it was easier for this
application simply to write out the values in a plain manner.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x1820c60"></a>
Error Handling</h2></div></div><p>
As MonoBlog makes calls to the Internet where things can go wrong that
aren't within the control of the program (network errors, name
server problems and so on), it contains some basic error handling
functionality. The getRecentPosts() and OnUpdateClicked() methods are
wrapped in a try...catch block. The code that accesses the Internet is
executed, and if there is a problem, the following catch block runs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
catch(Exception problem) {
  MessageDialog md =
  new MessageDialog(MonoBlogWindow,
  DialogFlags.DestroyWithParent,
  MessageType.Error,
  ButtonsType.Close,
  problem.ToString());

  md.Run();
  md.Destroy();
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This causes an Error dialog to appear on screen, with the problem
as reported by the Mono CLR included as a text message. This allows
the user to continue and possibly fix the problem. However, at the time
of this writing, exception support is not working in the PPC branch of the
Mono CLR, so if the program runs on Mac OS X, the exception mechanism
does not work and the program fails silently. Work is proceeding
on the PPC port, though, so by the time this article makes it to
print, this lack of support may no longer be an issue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1727580.0x18176a8"></a>
Compiling and Running</h2></div></div><p>
Compiling C# programs is done by way of the mcs compiler. MonoBlog
is compiled with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mcs -r gtk-sharp.dll -r glade-sharp.dll \
-r XmlRpcCS.dll -r glib-sharp.dll monoblog.cs
</pre>
</p><p>
The -r option indicates a resource the program
needs; here, we simply need to specify which libraries MonoBlog
uses. This produces a compiled bytecode file called
monoblog.exe. To run the program, we need to run
the Mono CLR with this file as a parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mono monoblog.exe
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, having developed the program on Linux, we can run the program on
Windows or Mac OS X with a minimum of fuss. Simply copy
monoblog.exe, monoblog.exe.config and monoblog.glade
files to the other platform and run them using the Mono CLR, as shown above.
</p><p>
Figures 3, 4 and 5 show MonoBlog running on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X
machines, respectively. No code has to be changed; the program works as is, as
long as all the libraries MonoBlog uses are present.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, this article has demonstrated how Mono and C# can be used to create
cross-platform applications quickly and easily. You can
develop on one platform and be assured that the program can run on any
platform that runs Mono and the GTK libraries. The MonoBlog program
itself is ripe for further experimentation. Some possible areas
for improvement are extra formatting
options, more detailed error reporting, using the GtkHTML# bindings to
create an HTML preview window, and
further implementation of the MetaWeblog API, such as adding the ability
to delete posts from a Weblog.
