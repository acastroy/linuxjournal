Adapt your software to run on processors without
memory management&mdash;it's easier than you think.

uClinux has seen a huge increase in popularity and is appearing in more
commodity devices than ever before. Its use in routers (Figure 1), Web
cameras and even DVD players is testimony to its versatility.
The explosion of low-cost, 32-bit CPUs capable of running uClinux is
providing even more options to manufacturers considering uClinux. Now
with uClinux's debut as part of the 2.6 kernel, it is set to become even
more popular.

With more embedded developers facing the possibility of working with
uClinux, a guide to its differences from Linux and its traps and pitfalls is
an invaluable tool. Here we discuss the changes a developer might
encounter when using uClinux and how the environment steers the
development process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a52580.0x2b4a5b0"></a>
No Memory Management</h2></div></div><p>
The defining and most prevalent difference between uClinux and other Linux systems is the
lack of memory management. Under Linux, memory management is achieved
through the use of virtual memory (VM). uClinux was created for systems
that do not support VM. As VM usually is implemented using a processing
unit called an MMU (memory management unit), you often hear the term
NOMMU when traveling in uClinux circles.
</p><p>
With VM, all processes run at the same address, albeit a virtual one,
and the VM system takes care of what physical memory is mapped
to these locations. So even though the virtual memory the process
sees is contiguous, the physical memory it occupies can be scattered
around. Some of it even may be on a hard disk in swap. Because
arbitrarily located memory can be mapped to anywhere in the
process' address space, it is possible to add memory to an
already running process.
</p><p>
Without VM, each process must be located at a place in memory where it
can be run. In the simplest case, this area of memory must be
contiguous. Generally, it cannot be expanded as there may be other
processes above and below it. This means that a
process in uClinux cannot increase
the size of its available memory at runtime as a traditional Linux process
would.
</p><p>
Although all programs need to be relocated at run time so that they can
execute, it is a fairly transparent task for the developer. It is the direct
effect of no VM that is the thorn in every uClinux developer's side. The
net effect is that no memory protection of any kind is offered&mdash;it is possible for any application or the kernel to corrupt any part of
the system. Some CPU architectures allow certain I/O areas,
instructions and memory regions to be protected from user programs but
that is not guaranteed. Even worse than the corruption that crashes a
system is the corruption that goes unnoticed, and tracking down random
interprocess corruption can be extremely difficult.
</p><p>
Without VM, swap is effectively impossible, although this limitation is rarely
an issue on the kinds of systems that run uClinux. They often do not
have hard drives or enough memory to make swap worthwhile.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a52580.0x2b4a870"></a>
Kernel Differences</h2></div></div><p>
To a kernel developer, uClinux offers little in the way of
differences from Linux. The only real issue is that you cannot take
advantage of the paging support provided by an MMU. In practice, this
doesn't affect much of the kernel. tmpfs, for example, does not work on
uClinux because it relies on the VM system.
</p><p>
Similarly, all of the standard executable formats are unsupported,
because they make use of VM features that do not exist under uClinux.
Instead, a new format is required, the flat format. Flat
format is a condensed executable format that stores only executable
code and data, along with the relocations needed to load the executable
into any location in memory.
</p><p>
Device drivers often need some work when you move to uClinux, not
because of differences in the kernels, but due to the kinds of devices
the kernel needs to support. For example, the SMC network driver
supports ISA SMC cards. They usually are 16-bit and are located at I/O
addresses below 0x3ff. The same driver easily can be made to support the
non-ISA embedded versions of the chip, but it may need to run in 8-, 16-
or 32-bit mode, at an I/O address that is a full 32-bit address and at an
interrupt number quite often higher than ISA's maximum of 16. So despite the
fact that the bulk of the driver is the same, the hardware specifics can
require a little porting effort. Quite often, older drivers store I/O
addresses in short format, which does not work on an embedded uClinux
platform with devices appearing at memory-mapped I/O addresses.
</p><p>
The implementation of mmap within the kernel is also quite different.
Though often transparent to the developer, it needs to be understood so
it is not used in ways that are particularly inefficient on uClinux
systems. Unless the uClinux mmap can point directly to the file within
the filesystem, thereby guaranteeing that it is sequential and
contiguous, it must allocate memory and copy the data into the allocated
memory. The ingredients for efficient mmap usage under uClinux are quite
specific. First, the only filesystem that currently guarantees that
files are stored contiguously is romfs. So one must
use romfs to avoid the allocation. Second, only read-only mappings can
be shared, which means a mapping must be read-only in order to avoid the
allocation of memory. The developer under uClinux cannot take advantage
of copy-on-write features for this reason. The kernel also must
consider the filesystem to be &ldquo;in ROM&rdquo;, which means a nominally
read-only area within the CPU's address space. This is possible if the
filesystem is present somewhere in RAM or ROM, both of which are
addressable directly by the CPU. One cannot have a zero allocation mmap
if the filesystem is on a hard disk, even if it is a romfs
filesystem, as the contents are not directly
addressable by the CPU.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a52580.0x2b4aad8"></a>
Memory Allocation (Kernel and Application)</h2></div></div><p>
uClinux offers a choice of two kernel memory allocators. At first it may not
seem obvious why an alternative kernel memory allocator is needed, but
in small uClinux systems the difference is painfully apparent. The
default kernel allocator under Linux uses a power-of-two allocation
method. This helps it operate faster and quickly find memory areas of
the correct size to satisfy allocation requests. Unfortunately, under
uClinux, applications must be loaded into memory that is set aside by
this allocator. To understand the ramifications of this, especially for
large allocations, consider that an application requiring a 33KB
allocation in order to be loaded actually allocates to the next
power of two, which is 64KB. The 31KB of extra space allocated cannot
be utilized effectively. This order of memory wastage is
unacceptable on most uClinux systems. To combat this problem, an
alternative memory allocator has been created for the uClinux kernels.
It commonly is known as either page_alloc2 or kmalloc2, depending on the
kernel version.
</p><p>
page_alloc2 addresses the power-of-two allocation wastage by using a
power-of-two allocator for allocations up to one page in size (a page is
4,096 bytes, or 4KB). It then allocates memory rounded up to the nearest
page. For the previous example, an application of 33KB actually
has 36KB allocated to it; a savings of 28KB for a 33KB application is
possible.
</p><p>
page_alloc2 also takes steps to avoid fragmenting memory. It allocates
all amounts of two pages (8KB) or less from the start of memory up and
all larger amounts from the end of free memory down. This stops
transient allocations for network buffers and so on, fragmenting memory
and preventing large applications from running. For a more detailed
example of memory fragmentation, see the example in the Applications
and Processes section below.
page_alloc2 is not perfect, but it works well in practice, as the
embedded environments that run uClinux tend to have a relatively static
group of long-lived applications.
</p><p>
Once the developer gets past the kernel memory allocation differences,
the real changes appear in the application space. This is where the
full impact of uClinux's lack of VM is realized.
The first major difference most likely to cause an
application to fail under uClinux is the lack of a dynamic stack. On VM
Linux, whenever an application tries to write off the top of the stack,
an exception is flagged and some more memory is mapped in at the top of
the stack to allow the stack to grow. Under uClinux, no such luxury is
available as the stack must be allocated at compile time. This means
that the developer, who previously was oblivious to stack usage within
the application, must now be aware of the stack requirements.
The first thing a developer should consider when
faced with strange crashes or behavior of a newly ported application is
the allocated stack size. By default, the uClinux toolchains allocate
4KB for the stack, which is close to nothing for modern applications.
The developer should try increasing the stack size with one of the
following methods:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Add <tt  >FLTFLAGS = -s &lt;stacksize&gt;</tt> and
<tt  >export FLTFLAGS</tt> to the Makefile for the application before building.
</p></li><li><p>
Run <tt  >flthdr -s &lt;stacksize&gt; executable</tt> after the
application has been built.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The second major difference that strikes a uClinux developer is the lack
of a dynamic heap, the area used to satisfy memory allocations with
malloc and related functions in C. On
Linux with VM, an application can increase its process size, allowing it to
have a dynamic heap. This traditionally is implemented at the low level
using the sbrk/brk system calls, which increase/change the size of a
process' address space. The heap's management by library functions such
as malloc then is performed on the extra memory obtained by calling
sbrk() on behalf of the application. If an application needs more memory
at any point, it can get more simply by calling sbrk() again; it
also can decrease memory using brk(). sbrk() works by adding more memory to
the end of a process (increasing its size). brk() arbitrarily can set
the end of the process to be closer to the start of the process (reduce
the process size) or further away (increase the process size).
</p><p>
Because uClinux cannot implement the functionality of brk and sbrk, it
instead implements a global memory pool that basically is the kernel's
free memory pool. There are pitfalls with this method. For example, a
runaway process can use all of the system's available memory. Allocating
from the system pool is not compatible with sbrk and brk, as they require
memory to be added to the end of a process' address space. Thus, a
normal malloc implementation is no good, and a new implementation is needed.
</p><p>
A global pool approach has some advantages. First, only the
amount of memory actually required is used, unlike the pre-allocated heap
system that some embedded systems use. This is extremely important on
uClinux systems, which generally are running with little memory.
Another advantage is that memory can be returned to the global pool as
soon as it is finished being used, and the implementation can take advantage of
the existing in-kernel allocator for managing this memory, reducing the
size of application code.
</p><p>
One of the common problems new users encounter is the missing memory
problem. The system is showing a large amount of free memory, but an
application cannot allocate a buffer of size X. The problem here is
memory fragmentation, and all of the uClinux solutions available at this
time suffer from it. Because of the lack of VM in the uClinux
environment, it is nearly impossible to utilize memory fully due to
fragmentation. This is best explained by example. Suppose a system has
500KB of free memory and one wishes to allocate 100KB to load an
application. It is easy to think that this would be possible. However,
it is important to remember that one must have a contiguous 100KB block of
memory in order to satisfy the allocation. Suppose the memory map looks
like this. Each character represents approximately 20KB, and X marks areas
allocated or in use by other programs or by the kernel:


<pre     class="programlisting">
  0    100   200   300  400   500   600   700  800   900   1000
 -+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+--
  |XXXXX|XXXXX|---XX|--X--|-X---|XX---|-X---|-XX--|-X---|XXXXX|
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, 500KB are free, but the largest contiguous block is
only 80KB. There are many ways to arrive at such a situation. A program
that allocates some memory and then frees most of it, leaving a small
allocation in the middle of a larger free block, often is the cause.
Transient programs under uClinux also can affect where and how memory is
allocated. The uClinux page_alloc2 kernel allocator has a configuration
option that can help identify this problem. It enables a new /proc
entry, /proc/mem_map, that shows pages and their allocation grouping.
Documenting this is beyond the scope of this article, but more
information can be found in the kernel source for page_alloc2.c.
</p><p>
The question is often asked, why can't this memory be defragmented so
it is possible to load a 100KB application? The problem is that we
don't have VM and we cannot move memory being used by programs.
Programs usually have references to addresses within the allocated
memory regions, and without VM to make the memory always appear to be at
the correct address, the program will crash if we move its memory. There
is no solution to this problem under uClinux. The developer needs to be
aware of the problem and, where possible, try to utilize smaller
allocation blocks.

Applications and Processes</h2></div></div><p>
Another difference between VM Linux and uClinux is the lack of the
fork() system call. This can require quite a lot of work on the
developer's part when porting applications that use fork(). The only
option under uClinux is to use vfork(). Although vfork() shares many
properties with fork(), the differences are what matter the most.
</p><p>
fork() and vfork(), for those unfamiliar with these system calls,
allow a process to split into two processes, a parent and a child. A
process can split many times to create multiple children. When a process
calls fork(), the child is a duplicate of the parent in all ways, but
it shares nothing with the parent and can operate independently, as can the
parent. With vfork() this is not the case. First, the parent is
suspended and cannot continue executing until the child exits or calls
exec(), the system call used to start a new application.
The child, directly after returning from
vfork(), is running on the parent's stack and is using the parent's
memory and data. This means the child can corrupt the data structures
or the stack in the parent, resulting in failure. This is avoided by ensuring
that the child never returns from the current stack frame once vfork() has
been called and that it calls _exit when finishing&mdash;exit cannot be called as it
changes data structures in the parent. The child also must avoid
changing any information in global data structures or variables, as such
changes may break the execution of the parent.
</p><p>
Making an application use vfork instead of fork usually falls into
the absolutely simple or incredibly difficult category. Generally,
if the application does not fork and then exec() almost immediately, it needs
to be checked carefully before fork() can be replaced with vfork().
</p><p>
The uClinux flat executable format, though it doesn't directly affect
applications and their operations, does allow quite a few options that
the usual ELF executables under Linux do not.
Flat format executables come in two basic flavors, fully relocated and a
variation of position-independent code (PIC). The fully relocated
version has relocations for its code and data, while the PIC version
generally needs only a few relocations for its data.
</p><p>
One of the most advantageous features to the embedded developer is
execute-in-place (XIP). This is where the application executes directly
from Flash or ROM, requiring the absolute minimum of memory, because
only the memory for the data of the application is needed. This allows
the text or code portion to be shared between multiple instances of the
application. Not all uClinux platforms are capable of XIP, as it requires
compiler support and the PIC form of the flat executable. So unless the
toolchain for a given platform can do PIC, it cannot do XIP. Currently,
only the m68k and ARM toolchains provide the required level of support
for flat format XIP. romfs is the only filesystem to
support XIP under uClinux, because the application must be stored contiguously
within the filesystem for XIP to be possible.
</p><p>
The flat format also defines the stack size for an application as a
field in the flat header. To increase the stack allocated to an
application, a simple change of this field is all that is required. This
can be done with the flthdr command, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
flthdr -s  flat-executable
</pre>
</p><p>
The flat format also allows two compression options. The entire
executable can be compressed, providing maximum ROM savings. It also
offers the often useful side effect that the application is loaded
entirely into a contiguous RAM block. You also may choose
data-segment-only compression. This is important if you want to save ROM space but
still want the option to utilize XIP. The following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
flthdr -z flat-executable
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a52580.0x2b4b630"></a></h2></div></div><p>
creates a fully compressed executable,
and

<pre     class="programlisting">
flthdr -d flat-executable
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a52580.0x2b4b790"></a></h2></div></div><p>
compresses only the data segment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a52580.0x2b4b898"></a>
Shared Libraries</h2></div></div><p>
Although a complete discussion of shared libraries is beyond
the scope of this article, they are quite different under
uClinux. The currently available solutions require compiler
changes and care on the part of the developer. The best way
to create shared libraries is to start with an example. The
current uClinux distributions provide shared libraries
for both the uC-libc and uClibc libraries. The method for
creating a shared library isn't difficult, and both of these
libraries provide a good, clean example of how it is done. To
set expectations appropriately, the GCC -shared option is not
part of the shared library creation process, so do not expect it
to be familiar. Shared libraries under uClinux are flat format
executables, just like applications, and to be truly shared must
be compiled for XIP. Without XIP, shared libraries result
in a full copy of the library for each application using it,
which is worse than statically linking your applications.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
The step into uClinux from Linux often is more than the differences
between uClinux and Linux. uClinux systems tend to be more deeply embedded
systems, with smaller memories and ROM footprints and an unusual array of
devices. The loss of a hard drive and the tight resource limits,
coupled with no memory protection and a number of other subtle
differences can make a developer's first adventure into uClinux
more difficult than imagined. The best way to get started is to look at the
uClinux Emulators (Figure 2) and cheap hardware (Figure 3) options available.
