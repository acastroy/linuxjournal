Your next mobile phone server will run Linux. Leading telecom vendors are
enhancing Linux for reliability, high availability, scalability and more.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1202580.0x12fa348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In January 2002, the Open Source Development Labs
(OSDL, <a href="http://www.osdl.org" target="_self">www.osdl.org</a>) established the Carrier Grade Linux (CGL)
Working Group. This initiative was intended to enhance
the Linux kernel to achieve a highly available,
secure, scalable and easily maintained open-source
platform suitable for carrier grade systems.
</p><p>
Many companies joined the CGL initiative, and today
the CGL is composed of member
companies that work together contributing to the CGL
requirement definition, helping current and starting new open-source projects to meet these requirements. Many
CGL member companies already have contributed
pieces of various technologies to open source to make
the Linux kernel a more viable option for telecom
platforms. CGL activities are providing
momentum for Linux in the telecom space, allowing
it to be an alternative to proprietary
operating systems.
</p><p>
Gateways, signaling and management servers are the
three main areas into which the CGL Working Group expects the majority
of applications implemented on CGL platforms to fall. In addition
to specifying the requirements, the Working Group also identifies
existing open-source projects supporting the road map, implementing
required components and interfaces of the platform. When an open-source
project does not exist to support a CGL requirement, the Working Group
launches or supports new projects to implement the missing functionality.
</p><p>
The scope of the CGL Working Group covers two main areas, carrier
grade enhancements to the kernel and development tools.
Kernel enhancements cover availability, security,
scalability and reliability, as well as changes
to interfaces for hardware, user-level code,
application code and development and debugging tools.
Software development tools covered by CGL include
debuggers and analyzers.
</p><p>
The CGL Requirements Definition Version 2.0, released October 9, 2003,
divides the requirements into the following main categories:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Clustering supports the use of multiple carrier server systems
providing higher levels of service availability through redundant
resources and recovery capabilities.
</p></li><li><p>
The security requirements aim at maintaining
a certain level of security while not endangering
the goals of high availability, performance and
scalability. These requirements support the use of
additional security mechanisms to protect the systems
and provide special mechanisms at kernel level to be
used by telecom applications.
</p></li><li><p>
Standards: CGL specifies standards to which
compliance is required, including the Linux Standard
Base, POSIX standards and a number of
Internet RFCs.
</p></li><li><p>
CGL specifies platform requirements that support interactions with
the hardware making up carrier grade systems. Examples of
platform requirements include: hot insert, hot remove, remote boot
support, boot cycle detection and support for diskless systems.
</p></li><li><p>
Availability requirements support heightened availability of carrier
grade systems, such as improving the robustness of software components
or by supporting recovery from failure of hardware or software. Examples
include support for watchdog timer interface, disk and volume management,
Ethernet link aggregation and link failover and
application heartbeat monitor.
</p></li><li><p>
Serviceability requirements support the availability of
applications and the operating system. Examples include support for
producing and storing kernel dumps, dynamic debug of the kernel and
running applications, platform signal handler and remote access to
event logs.
</p></li><li><p>
Performance requirements support performance levels necessary
for the environments a carrier grade system would encounter. Examples
include support for application (pre) loading, soft real-time performance,
kernel preemption and RAID 0 support.
</p></li><li><p>
Scalability requirements support vertical and horizontal scaling
of carrier server systems, such as the addition of hardware resources to
result in acceptable increases in capacity and throughput.
</p></li><li><p>
Tools requirements provide capabilities to facilitate diagnosis,
such as the support for a kernel debugger, kernel dump analysis and
the capability to debug multi-threaded programs.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Many individuals within the CGL initiative are active participants in the
main-line Linux development community. In addition, the implementations providing the
carrier grade enhancements to the kernel are open-source projects and
are planned for integration with the Linux kernel. All of the enhancements
are available from their respective project Web sites; please refer to
the OSDL Web site for links.
</p><p>
As of January 2004, the CGL Working Group is developing CGL version
3.0. The group expects to release the final official version by October
2004. The participation in OSDL CGL is open to
everyone. For more information, please visit the OSDL Web site.
