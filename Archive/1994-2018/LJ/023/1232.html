    Some people have decided that MS Windows has won the desktop
    war, and there will be no competition for the foreseeable
    future. I think that assumption is a little premature, for two reasons.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2436580.0x252e2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux users can run not only native Linux
programs but also many DOS, SVR3 Unix, SVR4 Unix, and Macintosh
programs by using emulation programs. It is very clear that this
makes Linux a more universally useful system. There are emulators
for lots of older computers as well, including Apple ][, Commodore
64, and others, which are useful to some people, and certainly fun
for people who like games they used to play on their old computers.
What has been missing from this list so far has been real support
for MS Windows programs. This is a pity, since there are more
applications for MS Windows than any other computing platform on
the planet. Not only are there many applications, but they are
well-known, and people know how to use them.
</p><p>Some people have decided that MS Windows has won the desktop
war, and there will be no competition for the foreseeable future. I
think that assumption is a little premature, for two reasons. The
first is that despite the fact that MS Windows has
<span   class="bold"><b>more</b></span> applications, many of them
are not particularly high quality. The second, and far more
important reason, is that even if you concede the
<span   class="bold"><b>API war</b></span> to Microsoft, doesn't mean
that Microsoft has won the war for the
<span   class="bold"><b>desktop</b></span>. That is, even if all the
applications out there were written only for MS Windows, MS Windows
wouldn't be your only choice for an &ldquo;operating system&rdquo;&mdash;it's
possible to emulate MS Windows. It's even possible to do a better
job of it than Microsoft.</p><p>It's also important not to loose perspective; there are
applications that Linux already runs, without any MS Windows
emulation, and Linux is already a wild success in many important
areas.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2436580.0x252e5b0"></a>Wine</h2></div></div><p>Most Linux users are aware that for about two and a half
years, a team of programmers has been steadily working on a project
called Wine, which is essentially a near-clone of MS Windows
designed to run under the X Window System. For a long time, Wine
could run only simple programs like Windows Solitaire, and when
some onlookers waited for <span   class="bold"><b>a whole
month</b></span> after Solitaire worked, and found that Microsoft
Word <span   class="bold"><b>still</b></span> didn't work under Wine,
they decided that Wine was dead and proclaimed their amazing
deduction to all readers of the Linux Usenet newsgroups&mdash;though
they neglected to include their skewed logic&mdash;which caused some
other readers to believe them.</p><p>The Wine developers plodded carefully along, undeterred, and
Wine has slowly matured, and is now approaching general usefulness.
While each new release of Wine is still &ldquo;for developers only&rdquo;,
some &ldquo;real&rdquo; MS Windows-based applications are starting to work.
That doesn't mean that they are useful yet&mdash;there is no support yet
for printing from Wine, for instance&mdash;but it does mean that the
Wine developers are still making steady progress.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2436580.0x252e7c0"></a>TWIN</h2></div></div><p>Some Linux users have heard that a new company called Willows
(<a href="http://www.willows.com" target="_self">www.willows.com</a>)
is developing a commercial programming library called TWIN, which
was just released as BETA software a few weeks ago. It allows
developers to write applications for MS Windows and then turn them
into native applications (which maintain the MS Windows look and
feel) on Unix and Linux systems, and in the future (according to
Willows), Macintosh and OS/2 systems.</p><p>While TWIN is explicitly not being sold as an MS Windows
emulator&mdash;&ldquo;...we do not currently provide [or] support pure
emulation capability for &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; products (such as MS
WORD and EXCEL) as a stand-alone capability.''&mdash;they do provide the
ability to run MS Windows-based binary programs that developers
need, including both DLLs and EXEs. Their FAQ states: &ldquo;I am
currently running Microsoft Office Applications, Word, Excel and
Project. These are the best ways for us to verify the
library...&rdquo;</p><p>Now that Willows' TWIN has been released, it is appropriate
to compare it to Wine. The most important difference is that
Willows says that TWIN is intended only as a developer's tool, and
that the binary capabilities are intended to help developers. By
contrast, Wine is intended primarily to become a tool for end-users
to run their normal MS Windows applications, and the developer's
library which comes with it is almost a by-product (which doesn't
mean that it is low-quality or useless). Wine runs only on Intel
platforms, whereas TWIN has &ldquo;binary emulation&rdquo; and can run on
other platforms as well. TWIN can use standard MS Windows printer
drivers, whereas printing support is still missing from Wine. TWIN
is commercial software, and Wine is freeware. TWIN is more
complete.</p><p>Willows is also participating in an effort to make an ISO
standard, non-proprietary version of the MS Windows programming
API. The Application Programming Interface for Windows, or APIW, is
a publicly available standard that will not only help Willows, Sun,
and other companies that wish to clone the MS Windows programming
interface, but will also help the Wine project in two ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>By providing more documentation on how the MS
Windows programming interface works (Microsoft has not been helpful
on this point, and has refused to take part in the APIW
specification process), the Wine programmers will need less
trial-and-error to determine doubtful points, making their job
easier, and</p></li><li><p>By helping standardize how MS Windows applications
work, APIW has the potential to make it easier for Wine to support
more applications.</p></li></ul></div><p>No stone is being left un-turned in the effort to provide MS
Windows-based applications to Linux users. The team of programmers
that works on the Linux DOS box, DOSEMU, has been able to run MS
Windows 3.1 in the DOSEMU DOS box under Linux. This is not
particularly stable, and kernel patches are required, but for
people who need to run MS Windows-based applications
<span   class="bold"><b>right now</b></span>, don't want to re-boot
to do so, and have sufficient technical understanding, it is an
option.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2436580.0x252ec90"></a>The Desktop is Not Conceded</h2></div></div><p>A few points (or rather, bullets):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux is a success on the desktop, even without MS
Windows application support.</p></li><li><p>Support for MS Windows applications is important,
though it isn't paramount.</p></li><li><p>MS Windows application support is not being
ignored, though it is not yet ready for &ldquo;prime time&rdquo; use.</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
