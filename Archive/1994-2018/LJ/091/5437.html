about a feature of Enhydra. Enhydra is commercial software, based
on Java, which is commercial software. As far as I can see, there
is no mention of Linux or anything specific to Linux in the
article. It would not be out of place in a magazine called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Web Automation</em></span>, but I fail to see why it
belongs in a magazine devoted to Linux, and more generally, to free
software.</p><p>&mdash;Carl Fink</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reuven replies:</b></span> While Java
isn't free software, many web developers want or need to use Java
in their work. I cannot change the Java license, but I can
encourage Java developers to use an open-source operating system
(Linux) and an open-source application server (Enhydra). So far as
I understand it, there are two different ways to get Enhydra. The
first is to obtain the core Enhydra application server, which is
freely downloadable and distributable. This includes XMLC, DODS,
super servlets and all that other stuff. The license agreement for
this is indeed open source, despite what you might read elsewhere
on the Enhydra web site. Here are three URLs about the licensing
scheme:
<a href="http://www.enhydra.org/aboutEnhydra/index.html" target="_self">www.enhydra.org/aboutEnhydra/index.html</a>,
<a href="http://enhydra.enhydra.org/software/license/rationale.html" target="_self">enhydra.enhydra.org/software/license/rationale.htm</a>
and
<a href="http://enhydra.enhydra.org/software/license/opl.html" target="_self">enhydra.enhydra.org/software/license/opl.html</a>.
The second way is to get the Lutris EAS (Enhydra Application
Server), which is a commercially packaged and tested version of the
open-source stuff. I believe that you pay $995 US (or so) per CPU
for EAS, but you're paying for the support, not for the server
itself, in a twist on the open-source model. You could also argue
that my article about PostgreSQL wasn't specifically about Linux,
but the fact is that there are many people interested in using that
database on Linux. For better or worse, there are lots of Linux
devotees who also want to be able to use Java. Indeed, as someone
who does web development on Linux every day (and many nights) of
the week, I'm happy to know that I can now talk to clients about a
serious Java and EJB solution that goes above and beyond
Jakarta-Tomcat.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a2580.0x159a4a8"></a>Bug-Eaten Exploits</h2></div></div><p>I really enjoyed the article &ldquo;Loadable Kernel Module
Exploits&rdquo; by William Benton in the September 2001 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I know that such articles are
not meant to be exhaustive, but there is one bug in the Checking
and Logging Function Listing on page 26 that I consider to be
critical. The code hooks into the sys_call_table by saving the
current address of SYS_write and replacing it. It unhooks by
putting back the saved address. The bug is if there is more than
one such hook. If another module hooks the SYS_write entry after
this module, then an rmmod is done on this module, and the other
module will become unhooked.</p><p>An even worse scenario is possible: 1) Module A is insmod-ed
and hooks SYS_write. SYS_write points to wrapped_write in module A,
orgwrite points to the previous contents (assume it is the normal
entry). 2) Now module B does the same. SYS_write points to, say,
modified_write in module B, orgwrite points to wrapped_write in
module A. 3) Module A is rmmod-ed. SYS_write now contains the
original SYS_write value. But this means that modified_write in
module B is now bypassed. 4) Now module B is rmmod-ed. The
cleanup_module in module B will restore the SYS_write table entry
to point somewhere where module A used to reside. 5) Linux will
most likely crash.</p><p>Unfortunately, I am not really a kernel hacker, so I don't
know how I could tell the rmmod function that I don't want to be
removed. To be safe, you would need to rmmod in the reverse order
that you insmod-ed. I don't know enough about Linux to say how this
could be accomplished.</p><p>&mdash;John McKown</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Benton replies:</b></span> You are
correct; the situation you describe can be a problem for production
code if a system administrator is not careful. I had not assumed
that it would be a serious issue in example code (or in production
code with a vigilant system administrator), but it is good to
identify possible pitfalls in kernel programming. One (simple)
solution is to be careful what you load and unload and in what
order. As the old joke goes: &ldquo;Doctor, it hurts when I do this!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, don't do that, then!&rdquo;. There are plenty of ways to crash
your system poking around in the kernel, and it's best to avoid all
of them once you've identified them. In all seriousness, these
problems will exist as long as Linux does not provide a mechanism
for registering changes to the system call table. I don't think
they're horribly serious, since a degree of care on the part of the
user can prevent a crash. However, there is a workaround that can
give you some basic stability: in cleanup_module(), be sure to
check whether the system call table entry that you're about to
restore is what you think it should be. If not, issue a warning and
invoke the sync() system call before modifying the system call
table. That will minimize the damage in the event of a crash. As an
alternative (and more difficult) solution, you could replace the
create_module system call in the first module you load, wrapping it
with one that provides some sort of versioning system for the
system call table in a static stack or deque. I'll leave
implementing that as an exercise for the reader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a2580.0x159a7c0"></a>Kept Waiting</h2></div></div><p>Please congratulate Lydia Kinata for the magazine's new

at LinuxWorld and read your article on DreamWorks&mdash;what a great
visit that must have been!</p><p>Given what you saw there and may already know of, I was
wondering if you could offer a suggestion. I have a teenage son
that is very interested in animation, but the applications to do
that are pretty expensive. Can you suggest some Linux-based
rendering applications that are more affordable?</p><p>&mdash;Jack C.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin replies:</b></span> Jack, we had
a great time at DreamWorks. But DreamWorks is just the first. All
the studios have Linux migration projects underway.</p><p>You may want to start with Blender, a popular, freely
distributed 3-D modeling package for animation, rendering,
interactive 3-D and game creation. Unlike most no-cost animation
tools, there are printed books available on Blender. Other tools
that may be of interest include K-3D, Ayam, AC3D, Flow, Radiance
and BMRT. You can find their web pages by searching at

&ldquo;Loadable Kernel Module Exploit&rdquo;, I was interested in the technique
for hijacking the sys_call_table pointer and wrapping it within
your own function. I used to do something very similar in DOS in
the good ol' days, writing TSRs (Terminate and Stay Resident) and
other programs that &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; the bios or dos interrupts
vectors.</p><p>For programs, it was a simple case of restoring the original
interrupt vector (pointer), but with TSRs, one had to be careful
before restoring the original pointer. The problem being that if
several TSR utilities were installed, two might hijack the same
interrupt (often the keyboard). A properly written TSR would,
before uninstalling, check that the current pointer pointed indeed
to itself, if it didn't, then it could not uninstall as by doing so
it would clobber another, later installed, TSR.</p><p>The cleanup_module(void) routine in the article performs no
such check before restoring the sys_call_table[SYS_write] pointer,
something which at first sight appears dangerous to me in a
multitasking environment, especially one where the kernel can load
and unload modules automatically.</p><p>&mdash;John Jacq</p></div></div>
