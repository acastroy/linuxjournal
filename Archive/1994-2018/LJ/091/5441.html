    See how your preferences compare with the rest of <i  >LJ</i>'s intrepid readers, all of whom are highly attractive.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Sorting through the results of the 2001
Readers' Choice Awards, ballots gathered from six weeks of on-line
voting, it's clear that <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers
have opinions on everything&mdash;lots of opinions. Also evident is the
fact that more options, tools and methods exist now than ever
before; a good thing to keep in mind during a year so turbulent.
</p><p>This year over 6,500 readers voted in 24 categories, from
favorite Linux book and office suite, to favorite communications
board and backup utility. Thank you to everyone who participated.
Now, on to the results.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997608"></a>Favorite Distribution</h2></div></div><p>1. Red Hat 2. Debian 3. Mandrake</p><p>Red Hat received 30% of the votes this year, repeating their
victory from last year. Debian moved from fourth to second place
this year, and Mandrake stayed at third. Linux from Scratch and the
Polish Linux Distribution (PLD) were the most popular
write-ins.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997768"></a>Favorite Graphics Program</h2></div></div><p>1. The GIMP 2. xv/xview 3. CorelDRAW</p><p>The winner here is what you would expect; the GIMP received
77% of the total votes. xFig and Photoshop were the favorites among
write-in votes, with pleas for a Photoshop port abundant.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x29978c8"></a>Favorite Word Processor</h2></div></div><p>1. StarOffice 2. AbiWord 3. Kword</p><p>StarOffice wins this category for the second consecutive
year. Its nearest competitor, AbiWord, received half as many votes,
and the spread between it, KWord and Emacs was only 19 votes.
Though not really a word processor, LaTeX was the favorite
write-in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997a28"></a>Favorite Text Editor</h2></div></div><p>1. vim 2. vi (and clones) 3. GNU Emacs</p><p>We took your advice from last year and split vi and vim into
separate categories. This time around vim wins with twice as many
votes. <span   class="bold"><b>mcedit</b></span> took the write-in
vote.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997be0"></a>Favorite Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p>1. KDE 2. GNOME 3. Window Maker</p><p>This was one of the most popular categories, and KDE is the
clear winner, receiving 40% of all votes. GNOME came in second with
24.5%, and the favorite write-in was xfcr. And special mention, of
course, for the command line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997d40"></a>Favorite Office Suite</h2></div></div><p>1. StarOffice 2. KOffice 3. WordPerfect</p><p>StarOffice is your favorite word processor and your favorite
office suite this year, same as in 2000. KOffice finished a strong
second this year, after a small showing last year. And, the
write-in opinions want everyone to check out Open Office.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2997ea0"></a>Favorite Programming Language</h2></div></div><p>1. C 2. Perl 3. C++</p><p>Here's another category where we took your advice from last
year and split C/C++ into separate categories because, hey, they're
not the same. Java and PHP finish out the top five, with Python
just missing out by 15 votes. Kylix/Object Pascal had a strong
write-in showing, over 200 votes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998000"></a>Favorite Development Tool</h2></div></div><p>1. GCC 2. Emacs 3. KDevelop</p><p>GCC took first place again this year, but by a percentage
significantly lower than last year. Emacs continues to prove its
flexibility here, too. Last year's popular write-in, KDevelop, took
third place this year, while Borland's Kylix made another strong
write-in showing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998160"></a>Favorite Shell</h2></div></div><p>1. bash 2. tcsh 3. ksh</p><p>Eighty-one percent of all voters chose bash as their favorite
shell, with tcsh coming in a distant second.
<span   class="bold"><b>ksh</b></span> came in third, but only by
receiving five more votes than fourth-place zsh.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998318"></a>Favorite Processor Architecture</h2></div></div><p>1. AMD Athlon 2. Intel Pentium 3. PowerPC</p><p>Readers' favorite processor is the AMD Athlon, tallying 42%
of the votes. AMD's Duron, K6-II and Celeron were popular
write-ins. Quite a few votes commented that their selection of
Pentium was out of necessity, not performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998478"></a>Favorite Communications Board</h2></div></div><p>1. Cyclades 2. Digi International 3. Equinox</p><p>This one received the fewest total number of votes and,
judging from some of the comments, it's because not everyone knows
what we're talking about. Well, it's not a surfboard and it's not a
bulletin board. Of those who did get our meaning, Cyclades is the
favorite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x29985d8"></a>Favorite Database</h2></div></div><p>1. MySQL 2. PostgreSQL 3. Oracle</p><p>For a second year in a row, MySQL beat PostgreSQL by a 2:1
ratio. Combined, they received almost 80% of all votes. Write-in
favorites were the Red Hat Database (powered by PostgreSQL) and
GemStone/S.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998738"></a>Favorite Backup Utility</h2></div></div><p>1. tar 2. Amanda 3. Arkeia</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> is by far the favorite
backup tool our readers use. Amanda and Arkeia came in second and
third place, respectively, but only by a one-vote difference. BRU,
dump and homemade backup tools are also still in widespread
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x29988f0"></a>Favorite <i  >Linux Journal</i>
Column</h2></div></div><p>1. Cooking with Linux 2. Kernel Korner 3. At the Forge</p><p>Fans of Marcel Gagn&eacute;, author of the Cooking with Linux
column, came out in full force this year and moved him to the top
position. Second was the revolving-author Kernel Korner. The most
popular write-in&mdash;no, we're not making this up&mdash;was &ldquo;all of
them&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998aa8"></a>Favorite Programming Beverage</h2></div></div><p>1. Coffee 2. Water 3. Tea</p><p>Who would have thought this would be one of the most debated
categories on the ballot? We added Mountain Dew after last year's
outcry, only to be chided for forgetting Dr. Pepper (Other Soft
Drinks). Coffee keeps its power over all of us, and over 100 brave
souls admit to consuming foo-foo frilly coffee drinks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2998c08"></a>Favorite Linux Game</h2></div></div><p>1. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake III</em></span> 2.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xBill</em></span> 3. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span></p><p>Some write-in comments claim games aren't for serious Linux
users, but they sure do bring in the money and drive development.
And we all need a little fun now and then, right? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
III</em></span> is the favorite again this year, and the classics
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mahjongg</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shisen-sho</em></span>
dominate the write-ins.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d911c8"></a>Favorite Web Browser</h2></div></div><p>1. Netscape 2. Mozilla 3. Konqueror</p><p>Netscape captured 30% of the votes this year; Mozilla (bugs
and all) trailed by just over 300 votes. Internet Explorer was the
favorite write-in, but a sentiment shared by many is that they
&ldquo;all suck, just differently&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d91328"></a>Favorite Linux Web Site</h2></div></div><p>1. Slashdot 2. Freshmeat 3. LinuxToday</p><p>From company web sites promoting Linux products and service,
to international sites and community help sites, the list of
write-in favorites goes on and on. Of course, Slashdot is still the
first stop for the majority of voters, almost 30%. The most popular
write-in is
<a href="http://www.linuxnews.pl" target="_self">www.linuxnews.pl</a>, a
Polish Linux site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d914e0"></a>Favorite E-mail Client</h2></div></div><p>1. Netscape 2. KMail 3. pine</p><p>Although there are winners in this category, none claim
dominance. Barely 70 votes separated Netscape, in first place, from
third-place mutt. One-time favorite, elm, has fallen to the bottom
on the list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d91640"></a>Favorite Instant-Messaging Client</h2></div></div><p>1. Xchat 2. Jabber 3. BitchX</p><p>For those that participate in IM, Xchat is the favorite over
Jabber by 4%. The most popular write-ins are Licq and GnomeICU. And
quite a few you express disdain for all forms of IM or IRC. Even
more of you resort to AOL, Yahoo or MS's versions 'cause &ldquo;that's
what all my friends use&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d917a0"></a>Favorite Distributed File-Sharing System</h2></div></div><p>1. Gnutella 2. Freenet 3. OpenNAP</p><p>Remember last year when debate over this whole topic was
being played out in every coffee shop and courthouse across the US?
Well Metallica avoided the poorhouse, and Gnutella and Freenet
remain the preferred methods of file sharing. Among the write-ins,
audiogalaxy and MORPHEUS are mentioned most.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d91900"></a>Most Indispensable Linux Book</h2></div></div><p>1. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> by Ellen Siever
2. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> by Matt Welsh, et. al. 3.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux System Administration</em></span> by Vicki
Stanfield, et. al.</p><p>Perennial favorites, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>, once again find themselves
in the top two spots, but in a reversal from last year,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> is this year's first
choice. Man pages and other on-line documentation are the write-in
favorites, and it looks like just about every other Linux book
printed received at least one vote.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d91c70"></a>Favorite Ad Filtering Tool</h2></div></div><p>1. Junkbuster 2. Homemade 3. Squidguard</p><p>One person wrote in, &ldquo;Ads are a part of the page's design
and intended viewing.&rdquo; Apparently, he or she is alone in that
sentiment, as just about everyone else uses a filter, Junkbuster
being the one most named. A lot of people are making their own
proxies, too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x289f580.0x2d91dd0"></a>Favorite Audio Tool</h2></div></div><p>1. xmms 2. pmg123 3. RealAudio</p><p>Receiving 58.4% of the total vote, xmms is once again
readers' favorite audio tool. Comparatively, none of the others
accumulated more than 9%. Grip shows up most amongst the write-ins,
and support is still strong for the ogg tools.</p></div></div>
