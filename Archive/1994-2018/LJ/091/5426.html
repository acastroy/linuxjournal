    Part of the Enhydra server, DODS tries to bridge object andrelational databases.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd825b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Relational databases form the backbone of
most serious web applications because they make data storage and
retrieval easy, safe and flexible. This setup normally works
wonderfully, until developers begin to write their programs using
objects, which have a completely different paradigm. Is there any
way for us to close the gap between the object and relational
worlds?
</p><p>Actually, many ways exist to map relational databases to
objects and methods, and most programmers have found themselves
writing such systems on their own. As we saw last month, Perl
programmers can get some assistance from Alzabo, a module that
helps programmers to create tables and then provides a method-based
interface to manipulate them.</p><p>This month, we will look at DODS (Data Object Design Studio),
a tool similar to Alzabo in spirit, except that it is aimed at Java
programmers. DODS is a central part of Enhydra, whose upcoming
version (Enhydra Enterprise) is expected to be the first
open-source application server to implement J2EE (Java 2,
Enterprise Edition).</p><p>Right now, Enhydra Enterprise is still in beta testing, and
while the DODS support appears to have improved since the first
versions, I was told by David Young, the Enhydra evangelist at
Lutris, that DODS from Enhydra 3.x is more stable. So that I could
try things more easily, Lutris sent me a copy of EAS (Enhydra
Application Service), their commercially supported and enhanced
version of Enhydra.</p><p>I'm not entirely sure what the differences are between EAS
and the open-source Enhydra server; enhydra.org indicates that EAS
is &ldquo;based on&rdquo; Enhydra, but the differences between EAS and buying
a copy of Enhydra are not at all obvious. I will assume that the
copy of EAS I installed is largely similar to Enhydra 3.x, but this
might not be an accurate assumption.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd82818"></a>DODS Overview</h2></div></div><p>DODS, like the Perl Alzabo system we discussed last month,
has two goals: to help design databases with a high-end tool and to
provide a set of objects and methods for working with that
database. While Alzabo is a server-side web application, DODS is a
client-side application written in Java that lets you define and
edit your database definitions.</p><p>The goal of DODS is to create parallel SQL definitions and
Java classes that describe the same relational database. You then
feed the SQL definitions into your database and use the Java
classes to access them.</p><p>Moreover, DODS is designed to work with different databases;
at present, it works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sybase and Oracle, but
it may work with more in the future. Since the actual SQL queries
are written by an object middleware layer, this means you can move
your Enhydra programs from one database to another without having
to rewrite them. In reality, of course, things are more
complicated. For example, Enhydra's support of PostgreSQL is not
very impressive, ignoring the SERIAL data type (which is really
just a sequence) and unaware of referential integrity constrations,
such as foreign keys. Nevertheless, the goal is an admirable one,
and I'm looking forward to seeing how Enhydra 4.x handles this. As
time goes on, I expect that DODS will continue to improve its
support for different databases, creating appropriate queries for
individual SQL dialects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd829d0"></a>Creating the XMLC Document</h2></div></div><p>Let's create a simple web/database application using Enhydra
and DODS to demonstrate how it will work. I'll use PostgreSQL in my
examples, both because it's an excellent open-source database and
because DODS supports it. Our example, as has been the case for the
last few months, will be a simple weblog (or blog) application that
displays entries in a database table in reverse chronological
order. Writing such a program is not particularly difficult, making
it all the more attractive as a test of DODS and Enhydra.</p><p>Our first stop will be the Enhydra appwizard, which creates
the directories and skeleton files for our basic Enhydra
application. The appwizard is in <span   class="emphasis"><em>$ENHYDRA</em></span>/bin,
where <span   class="emphasis"><em>ENHYDRA</em></span> is an environment variable
naming the location of your Enhydra installation. (When I installed
it from CD using RPMs for my Red Hat Linux box, ENHYDRA was set to
/usr/local/lutris-enhydra3.5.2.)</p><p>On the first appwizard screen, I was allowed to choose
between a standard web application and an Enhydra super servlet. I
chose the latter. On the next screen, I chose an HTML project
(rather than a wireless WML project), named the project &ldquo;blog&rdquo;
and put it in the il.co.lerner package class. I also accepted the
default home for Enhydra applications, ~/enhydraApps/. I chose not
to associate a copyright with my source code and then clicked
Finish, which created 18 new files in ~/enhydraApps/blog.</p><p>Now that I've created the skeleton for my application, I'll
modify the default Welcome page that comes with Enhydra. We will
have to do this in two parts; first, we'll modify the HTML file
Welcome.html, which my computer placed in
~/enhydraApps/blog/src/il/co/lerner/presentation/Welcome.html.</p><p>Note that this file consists not just of HTML, but of tags
that will be processed by XMLC (see At the Forge in the August 2001
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> to see just what that
means). We'll change it to display the latest information from our
weblog, rather than the standard page, as you can see in Listing 1.
The only difference between an XMLC document and a standard page of
HTML is we mark the parts we want to modify inside of &lt;span&gt;
tags, with an id attribute. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span id="date"&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="text"&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre><p><a href="5426l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Welcome.html, the XMLC
Input File We'll Use to Display Our Weblog</a>
</p><p>If we display this file literally in our web browser, we'll
see the words Date and Text. But users will not retrieve this HTML
document directly. Rather, XMLC will turn our document into a Java
class. We will then use the WelcomePresentation class to create an
instance of the document, using automatically generated methods to
modify the date and text sections.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd82ea0"></a>Using DODS</h2></div></div><p>WelcomePresentation, however, will fill in the date and text
sections with information that it retrieved from a relational
database table. We will have to create the table, as well as
populate it with some information, before we can continue.</p><p>This is where DODS enters the picture. The DODS program,
which is in $ENHYDRA/bin/dods, is another graphical client-side
program written in Java. When working with DODS, we have to
remember that we're using a bridge between two different paradigms,
and the terminology may often be a bit weird.</p><p>DODS begins with a package, which is a container for all of
the tables and other attributes that we will create. By default, as
you can see from the initial DODS window, the package is named
root; I changed this to blog by clicking on the root folder and
selecting Package from the Edit menu.</p><p>We will create a database table (BlogEntries) with two
attributes: the date and the contents. (These match the two id tags
that are in our version of Welcome.html.) We first add a new table
to BlogEntries, using the Insert menu, choosing &ldquo;data object&rdquo; and
giving it the name BlogEntries.</p><p>Next, we must add two fields (date and text) to our table. In
order to do this, click on the BlogEntries name in the upper
left-hand corner of the DODS window, and use the Insert menu to add
each new attribute. Both of our attributes will be of type
&ldquo;varchar&rdquo;, meaning that we'll treat them both as text. And while
this will work perfectly well for our purposes, it's unfortunate
that DODS doesn't support the PostgreSQL TIMESTAMP data type, a
tool that allows us to perform all sorts of clever and
sophisticated manipulations on dates and times. So we'll store the
dates in text-only format, knowing that we can use ORDER BY to
retrieve them in order&mdash;and not much more than that.</p><p>Because we want to ensure maximum speed for our web/database
application, and because we'll be inserting text much less
frequently than we retrieve it, we will tell DODS to make both of
our fields indexable and queryable. The former will modify the SQL
defintion, ensuring that an index is created for the attribute. The
latter will create additional methods that allow us to retrieve
information based on this column.</p><p>Finally, we choose PostgreSQL from the Database menu, telling
DODS to create PostgreSQL-style SQL, rather than any other
database.</p><p>Once we're done creating our table with DODS, we export it
into DOML (using File Save as), an XML format that describes our
tables and can be used to generate both the SQL and Java. Make sure
to save the DOML file into the source directory within your project
and package; thus, I put it in blog/src/il/co/lerner. Once our DOML
file is complete (see Listing 2), we can turn it into Java and SQL
with the <b  >build all</b> command from the File menu.
Building everything results in the creation of a number of files
within the data directory, so when you're asked where you want to
build things, select the data directory in which you stuck the
blog.doml file. A window will pop up, describing what DODS is doing
at each moment. If everything is successful, you can exit from
DODS.</p><p><a href="5426l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. blog.doml, the
Automatically Generated File that DODS Creates</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd83318"></a>Creating the Database</h2></div></div><p>Running <b  >build all</b> from DODS turns the DOML
file into a set of files under the data directory. This directory
now contains not just a Makefile (previously empty), but also the
blog subdirectory in which the following four Java classes now
exist: BlogEntriesDO, a data-object class similar to Enhydra's
presentation objects for displaying information;
BlogEntriesDataStruct, which actually contains the data from our
table; BlogEntriesDOI, an interface for the BlogEntriesDO class;
and BlogEntriesQuery, which allows us to query fields we've
described as queryable.</p><p>In addition to the Java source code that was created, we also
have several files containing SQL. In particular, the data
directory contains create_tables.sql, which we can use as input to
create our database.</p><p>To do this, we use the CREATEDB command, which is normally
executed by an authorized PostgreSQL user from the UNIX shell.
(This does not necessarily mean the root user; check your
PostgreSQL installation documentation to see how to create
PostgreSQL superusers.)</p><p>We thus say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATEDB blog
</pre><p>We can then query that database interactively with
<pre     class="programlisting">
psql blog
</pre>


To create our tables using the automatically generated DODS script,
we use the <b  >\i</b> command from within psql:
<pre     class="programlisting">
\i /home/reuven/enhydraApps/blog/src/il/co/lerner/ data/create_tables.sql
</pre>


You should see several CREATE messages, and then the psql prompt
once again. Using the <b  >\d</b> command, we see that
DODS actually didn't create a table named BlogEntries. Rather, it
created two tables, one named objectid and the other (primary)
table named newdbtable, which is the default. The objectid table
comes in place of a PostgreSQL sequence, demonstrating one
limitation of this sort of generic tool, and has a column &ldquo;next&rdquo;
that indicates which ID comes next. We thus insert information into
the newdbtable table, adding a new row to objectid each time we do
so.
</p><p>Let's add several items to our table so that we'll then be
able to retrieve them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO newdbtable (entrydate, text, objectid, objectversion)
VALUES (NOW(), 'First blog entry', 1, 1);
INSERT INTO objectid ( next ) VALUES ( '2' );
INSERT INTO newdbtable (entrydate, text, objectid, objectversion)
VALUES (NOW(), 'Second blog entry', 2, 1);
INSERT INTO objectid ( next ) VALUES ( '3' );
</pre><p>Now that we have two blog entries inserted, we can exit psql
and go onto modifying our Java class.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0xd83898"></a>Pulling It All Together</h2></div></div><p>Our WelcomePresentation.java class is where most of the magic
happens. It creates instances of both Welcome.html and of our
database objects, retrieves the query results and then inserts
those results into the HTML file.</p><p>After you modify WelcomePresentation.java, as shown in
Listing 3 [available at
<a href="../listings/091/5426.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue91/5426.tgz</a>],
run a <b  >make</b> from the top-level directory for this
project. Enhydra will compile your Java classes, double-check that
everything is where it should be and get your application ready to
run.</p><p>Notice in Listing 3 that we had to modify the definition of
the &ldquo;run&rdquo; method such that it returns two new exceptions:
NonUniqueQueryException and DataObjectException. These are
generated by the various data objects that we've created, and since
we aren't going to catch these exceptions, we must indicate to the
caller that we may raise them.</p><p>Listing 3 uses the Enhydra QueryBuilder to create an SQL
query using methods created by DODS. We first create an instance of
BlogEntriesQuery, one of the automatically created classes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BlogEntriesQuery blogq = new BlogEntriesQuery();
</pre><p>We want to retrieve all rows until now, in reverse order by
entryDate:
<pre     class="programlisting">
blogq.setQueryEntrydate("NOW()", QueryBuilder.LESS_THAN);
blogq.addOrderByEntrydate(false);
</pre>


There are also methods for adding WHERE clauses to our SQL query,
letting us create arbitrarily complex SQL queries.
</p><p>Finally, we retrieve an array of matching rows, each of which
is represented by a BlogEntriesDO object:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BlogEntriesDO[] blogEntries = blogq.getDOArray();

</pre><p>We're only going to display the most recent one, so we will
simply get the first element of our array. We use the method in our
&ldquo;welcome&rdquo; object, created by XMLC, to insert the appropriate text
in our document:
<pre     class="programlisting">
welcome.setTextDate(blogEntries[0].getEntrydate());
welcome.setTextText(blogEntries[0].getText());
</pre>


Once we have modified WelcomePresentation.java, we create the
application by running <b  >make</b> from our top-level
project directory. If you see any errors in your Java program, you
can correct them and rerun make as often as you want.
</p><p>Theoretically, you could now run the application by changing
into the output subdirectory and running
<b  >./start</b>. But our application will fail if we do
this, since it doesn't yet know where to look for the PostgreSQL
.jar file. In addition, it's useful to get full debugging output
from Enhydra (or any application) when we're first using it, so
that we can identify and fix problems more quickly.</p><p>We must modify three files in order to get things to work.
First, we need to modify $ENHYDRA/bin/multiserver by adding a
reference to the PostgreSQL JDBC driver's .jar file. To do this, we
simply modify the multiserver (which is a shell script that invokes
a Java program), changing the lines under the comment &ldquo;build up
classpath&rdquo; to the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Where is the PostgreSQL JDBC .jar file?
PG_JDBC=/usr/share/pgsql/jdbc7.1-1.2.jar
if [ "X${CLASSPATH}" = "X" ] ; then
    NEWCP=${ENHYDRA_CLASSES}${PS}${PG_JDBC}
else
    NEWCP=${ENHYDRA_CLASSES}${PS}${CLASSPATH}${PS} ${PG_JDBC}
fi
</pre><p>Next, we modify blog.conf. Every Enhydra project has a
configuration file that tells the system which database to use, as
well as a number of other properties. In my particular case, the
configuration file is blog/output/conf/blog.conf and consists of a
lot of name-value pairs for my application.
</p><p>We must modify several parts of the &ldquo;Database manager&rdquo;
section in order to point to our programs. You can see the full
section, as it needs to be, in Listing 4 [available at
<a href="../listings/091/5426.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue91/5426.tgz</a>].</p><p>Finally, we modify servlet.conf. Although this doesn't need
to be modified, I find it useful to turn on DEBUG mode by modifying
the following two definitions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Server.LogToFile[] = EMERGENCY, ALERT, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO,
DEBUG
Server.LogToStderr[] = EMERGENCY, ALERT, CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
</pre><p>The most important thing to realize about blog.conf and
servlet.conf is that they are regenerated every time you do a
top-level make. So once you have modified them in this way, never
do a top-level make again. You will be quite sorry (as I have been)
if you do so. Rather, do a <b  >make</b> from within the
presentation directory.
</p><p>Once you have modified the configuration in this way, you can
go into ~/enhydraApps/blog/output and run
<b  >./start</b>. You will see the server start up, plus
a fair amount of debugging information if you activated DEBUG in
servlet.conf and logging in blog.conf.</p><p>You can check out your creation by pointing your web browser
to point 9000, the default port for Enhydra applications:
http://localhost:9000/. If all is well, you should see the output
from our weblog in your web browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc8a580.0x117c538"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>DODS is better than Alzabo at providing a nice object layer
above the SQL. Moreover, it seems to provide a better and more
stable set of methods for creating queries and working with their
results. However, DODS suffers from several of the same problems as
Alzabo and other relational-object mapping tools. Some problems
include having to learn a new way to execute all of those SQL
queries you've been working with for years and complex queries that
can be frustrating to write, since you have to rephrase them as
method calls. Also, the generic nature of a tool like DODS means
that you won't get the specific benefits of your favorite database.
In the case of PostgreSQL, DODS didn't seem to take foreign keys or
sequences into account, both of which would have made for more
solid table designs.</p><p>DODS works well when coupled with the rest of Enhydra,
though. As with XMLC and super servlets, I found DODS to be
somewhat overwhelming and clunky at first, and then useful and
clever. As a first stab at things, DODS in Enhydra is a good
attempt to bridge the gap between the object and relational worlds.
I look forward to the final version of Enhydra Enterprise, which
will undoubtedly push things ahead even further.</p><p>Next month, we'll look at an increasingly standard way to not
only bridge the relational and object worlds, but also to add
transactional capabilities to our server-side Java applications.
Enterprise JavaBeans represent services and data for web
applications and have become increasingly popular among web
developers who want to be able to find objects, work with them and
store them to a database, without having to think too hard.</p><p><a href="5426s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
