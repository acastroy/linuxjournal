platform-independent documents.</p><p>by Jan Schaumann</p><p>
We are told that Microsoft Word files can be viewed in any text
editor, which probably is why so many people insist on sending even
simple text documents as big Word attachments: &ldquo;These download
files are in Microsoft Word 6.0 format. After unzipping, these
files can be viewed in any text editor, including all versions of
Microsoft Word, WordPad and Microsoft Word Viewer&rdquo; (from
Microsoft's web site). How often do you receive an e-mail with a
Word document attached because the sender simply assumes that
everyone uses Microsoft Word (presuming they think about it at
all)? Not only is it dangerous for anyone actually using Word to
open attachments that might possibly contain macroviruses, but for
anyone not using any of Microsoft's products, they have become a
real nuisance. Actually, even people who do have MS Word need to
make sure they have the latest version (and possibly buy an
upgrade) because the discrepancies between the various versions are
so large that sometimes Word can't read Word. This article tries to
make your (office) life a bit easier by elaborating on the various
possibilities of dealing with these dreaded documents.</p><p>Short of rejecting any documents not in standard format (more
on this later), there is no optimal way of dealing with MS Word
documents in Linux. As mentioned above, sometimes even Word can't
read Word. There are, however, a number of approaches to opening
most documents and even preserving the format.</p><p>There are the full-fledged word processors (very similar to
Microsoft Word), a few file converters and some rather
unconventional means of extracting the information out of a .doc
file. Depending on your needs, you may choose different solutions
in different situations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc505b0"></a>Big Words</h2></div></div><p>If you need to do a lot of word processing and often exchange
documents with coworkers, you most certainly will want to install a
complete office suite. An office suite comes with, among other
things, a word processor that lets you read (and sometimes write)
various MS Word formats, even though they all have their own
document formats as well. The most common office suites available
for Linux are Applixware Office, Corel WordPerfect Office 2000,
KOffice and StarOffice (OpenOffice).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc506b8"></a>Applixware Office</h2></div></div><p>Of all the above, Applixware Office is the only one not
available at no cost. However, Applix was kind enough to provide me
with a copy of their software for this article (retail price is $99
US). I received a few colorful boxes containing a copy of
Applixware Office, Applixware Words (standalone) and Applixware
Spreadsheets (standalone). The Office package came with a beautiful
handbook, something that I would certainly appreciate, once I set
it up.</p><p>Eager to test the new software, I attempted to install
Applixware Words, following the instructions in the manual. As I
run Debian, I do not mind the fact that the instructions to install
per RPM are missing a step (you need to change the directories once
more to find the RPM-install script, which was not mentioned), and
I happily executed the setup binary.</p><p>At first, things seemed to go smoothly, but then
closed-software practices took their toll. There appears to be a
small bug in the install scripts that made it impossible for me to
install the software. When I attempted to install into /opt/applix
(as suggested by the program), the error log told me after the
failed installation that it apparently tried to install to
/optapplix, even though it created /opt/applix.</p><p>This would be just a minor nuisance if the user was able to
edit the install script, but as this is closed software, there was
nothing I could do. I tried /opt/applix and a few other tricks, but
to no avail.</p><p>Due to unmet dependencies (on a Debian system, it appears as
if I did not have any of the most basic RPMs installed) the RPM
install fails as well, so that in my last attempt to install
Applixware Words, I generated .deb packages from the RPMs using
alien:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /tmp/applix
cp cdrom/RPMS/*.rpm /tmp/applix/
cd /tmp/applix/
alien *.rpm
...
dpkg -i --force-overwrite *.deb
</pre><p>This seemed to install the packages, but running the
application led to several errors. I finally gave up and wrote an
e-mail to Applix to inquire about these problems.
</p><p>While word of mouth has it that this is a solid product&mdash;an
advantage of this suite is that its native file format is plain
ASCII text with the specifications freely available from the web
site, which makes it easy to write import/export filters&mdash;these
kinds of problems are rather frustrating.</p><p>The advantage of having a nice printed manual with a
(supposedly) fine product is, in my opinion, outweighed by the fact
that it's closed software. I can't go in and try to fix errors
myself, which leaves me helpless.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc50a80"></a>Corel WordPerfect Office 2000</h2></div></div><p>Corel, best known by most for its Linux distribution (Corel
Linux) and CorelDRAW, also developed a very powerful office suite.
Corel WordPerfect Office 2000 includes the well-known WordPerfect
word processor. WP offers anything one might wish for in a tool
like this; it has been regarded as superior to MS Word by many
people and is available for Windows and Linux. Curiously, it is not
available for the Mac, even though Corel offers other software for
this platform.</p><p>If you want to license WP Office 2000 for your entire office,
you will find a hefty price tag attached; however, for personal
use, you can download WordPerfect by itself for free. I found it a
breeze to install and use; it easily opened all of the Word
documents I found on my hard drive and was even able to display
mathematical formulae properly.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4734f1.large.jpg"><img src="4734f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. A Screenshot of WordPerfect
8</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc50df0"></a>KOffice</h2></div></div><p>KOffice, brought to you by the friendly people of KDE, was
released together with KDE 2.0 in October 2000, as beta software.
Nonetheless, the word processor KWord looks impressive. It
integrates nicely with all the other KDE applications and neatly
imported most of the MS Word documents I fed it.</p><p>Problems arose when I tried to open a document containing
mathematical formulae, but since I have been assured that these
formulae bring down every version of Word itself but the latest (no
surprise there), I would still recommend it. By the time KOffice
1.1 will be released, I'm sure KWord will easily suffice for most
needs.</p><p>This office suite is, of course, licensed under the GPL and
available for free download from your favorite mirror. Debian's
apt-get install, kword, took care of all dependencies for me, but
since KOffice relies on KDE 2.0 and Qt 2.2, you might find yourself
upgrading a lot of packages before you can use this program.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4734f2.large.jpg"><img src="4734f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. A Screenshot of KWord</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc511b8"></a>StarOffice/OpenOffice</h2></div></div><p>Some time ago, Sun Microsystems acquired StarOffice, an
office suite available for many operating systems. StarOffice was
one of the first office suites able to compete with Microsoft's
Office. While Sun always offered StarOffice for free download, only
fairly recently did they announce the release of the source code to
the Open Source community, which ultimately led to the OpenOffice
Project. So, this is another GPLed Project.</p><p>StarOffice/OpenOffice includes a very powerful word
processor, which can read most Word Documents and can even write to
.doc format. However, it has a drawback: it's a memory hog. Not
only does it require a significant amount of disk space for the
complete installation, it also takes awhile until all the
components are started. If you have a slow machine, this might not
be your first choice. On the other hand, if you have enough space
and memory, I'm sure you'll find that StarOffice/OpenOffice is able
to meet all of your word processing needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc51318"></a>Small Words</h2></div></div><p>All of the aforementioned applications are full office
suites, rather hefty packages more suited to people who actually do
perform a lot of word processing and who, at the same time, need to
have applications for spreadsheets and presentations, etc.</p><p>For those of you who just want a word processor for the
occasional letter of complaint to your landlord, there are some
lighter approaches. The most common lightweight word processor is
AbiWord. AbiWord, designed to be &ldquo;full-featured and remain lean&rdquo;,
seems to live up to its goal. It's fast, available for a large
variety of platforms, free (as in beer and as in speech) and under
heavy development. However, I do have to admit that it chokes on
some documents or opens them without preserving the original
format. In particular, MS Word's way of dealing with tables seems
to confuse AbiWord.</p><p>Another very small and light word processor is Pathetic
Writer (pw), which is part of the Siag Office Suite. The reason I
mention pw here and did not include it with the full-fledged office
suites is that it seems rather thin.
<span   class="bold"><b>pw</b></span> will not open Microsoft's
.docs, but it will happily perform your everyday word processing
and can import and export most common formats. Siag Office, just as
AbiWord, is published under the GPL and is available for free
download.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc51528"></a>Unconventional Words</h2></div></div><p>All of the above-mentioned applications have various
requirements: some rely heavily on pre-installed libraries (such as
KWord), some are rather resource hungry (StarOffice/OpenOffice),
others are expensive and/or not open sourced. However, all of them
try to preserve a certain style or a certain way of formatting a
document.</p><p>While this is certainly useful and important, I have found
that I have no use whatsoever for a word processor, no matter which
one. In 90% of the cases where some thoughtless person sends me a
.doc file, the information contained within the document could have
been communicated easily in plain text in a fraction of the file
size.</p><p>So let's talk business now and see how we can extract the
necessary information from proprietary file formats. There are a
few tools worth mentioning, and their beauty lies in the fact that
we do not even need X because they are all command-line
tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc516e0"></a>antiword</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>antiword</b></span> takes a Word
document as input and extracts the information contained in it,
converting it to plain ASCII text or to PostScript. It tries to
maintain the formatting as much as possible, and it does a fairly
decent job of it.</p><p>It's quick, and because it is a command-line tool, we can
redirect the output to another process or file for further
modification. To take a quick glance at the content of the file,
you could pipe the output to less:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
antiword HUGE.DOC | less
</pre><p>Or, if you'd rather have a hard copy:
<pre     class="programlisting">
antiword -p letter HUGE.DOC | lpr
</pre>


I found antiword so useful that I replaced my previous
mailcap-entry for handling of MS Word files (which I used to call
abiword) with the following line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
application/msword;antiword %s | vim -
</pre>


This allows me to read through .doc attachments from my mail reader
(mutt), and since I pipe the output right into my favorite editor,
I even can make modifications and save it to another file. Note
that by placing this entry into my ~/.mailcap, all applications
respecting this file will use antiword and vim to display .docs. If
you are using a graphical browser such as Netscape, you might want
to use a different editor or use the -g switch for vim to spawn a
GUI front end.
</p><p>If you are a hardcore minimalist, you will find that the
command strings, part of the GNU binutils package, is often
sufficient to extract the plain text information from a .doc file.
However, antiword has the significant advantage over strings in
that it can also extract images in addition to text.</p><p>For details on the use of the various options and on how to
extract images from a Word file, see antiword at
<a href="http://www.winfield.demon.nl/index.html" target="_self">www.winfield.demon.nl/index.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc51b00"></a>wv</h2></div></div><p>The other application, formerly known as mswordview and now
available as wv, has been around for quite some time. When I first
installed Red Hat 5.2 a few years ago, the Netscape browser used
mswordview as the standard application to handle .doc files, as it
converted them quite reliably into nice HTML. Note that I'm not
talking about wordview, a Microsoft product. The similarity in the
name caused the author to rename his tool.</p><p>While it certainly is great for a browser to use an
application that turns Word files into HTML, this is not always the
ideal output format. Therefore, wv now includes a whole set of
tools to convert Word documents into a large variety of formats,
including, but not limited to, ASCII text, HTML, LaTeX, PostScript
and PDF. <span   class="bold"><b>wv</b></span> is published under the
GPL and is available for free download.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc51cb8"></a>No Words</h2></div></div><p>So far we've seen how we can read Word documents and even
what options there are to write documents that, in Winworld, would
most likely be done in Word. But I can't help concluding that the
word processor itself, as an application, is not required or is
useless in the vast majority of cases.</p><p>The typical user trying to write a simple progress report,
for example, usually follows a certain scheme: writes something,
uses mouse to highlight the text, uses mouse to point and click and
select bold, presses Return a number of times, presses Space a
number of times, decides he/she doesn't like it, presses Delete a
number of times, uses mouse to point and click and select italics,
repeats.</p><p>I am fully aware that this is not the proper way to utilize a
powerful word processor, but let's face it, that's exactly how the
majority of users (those for whom these &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo;
applications are designed) work. The efforts required to enter a
table of contents, a bibliography, cross-references, etc., can only
be imagined.</p><p>Eventually, the outcome is a document that takes hours to
prepare and that looks only the way it should on this platform
using a particular version of this word processor. To avoid such
bad practices, let's investigate some alternative methods for
preparing platform-independent documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc48758"></a>A Classic: ASCII</h2></div></div><p>As I have mentioned repeatedly, the information contained
within the majority of documents is plain text. At times some fancy
formatting may be nice, but it's optional. The main interest of the
person writing the document should be to communicate the
information.</p><p>Simple, plain ASCII text is usually sufficient to send
information from one person to another&mdash;that's exactly why e-mail,
for example, is still a text medium. HTML in e-mails does not add
anything to the content. ASCII text can be read from anywhere with
any editor (and not just with &ldquo;any editor, including Microsoft
Word...&rdquo;). By structuring the text clearly, by using paragraphs
and horizontal lines constructed out of hyphens, maybe even by
using *bold*, /italics/ and _underlined_ text as used on Usenet,
one can write clear, easy-to-read and understand and, most
importantly, portable documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc488b8"></a>LyX and LaTeX</h2></div></div><p>While plain ASCII text should be the choice for most cases,
it cannot be denied that occasionally one might need or want more
formatting. Well, no need to dig out the old word processor again.
Just use LyX, the graphical front end to LaTeX.</p><p>LaTeX is an astounding typesetting engine derived from TeX.
It takes a .tex file as input and typesets it, generating a .dvi
file. It is available for a large variety of platforms, and
documents typeset with LaTeX look incredibly professional. Yet, you
can use your favorite editor to create the input files because
LaTeX is a command-line tool.</p><p>When using LaTeX, one can concentrate on the content of the
document instead of the way it looks because the typesetting engine
will take care of the layout. A .tex file contains a few tags
(which may remind you of HTML) to determine the way the text will
be displayed.</p><p>This is a completely different way of writing a document from
word processors; no more pointing and clicking and highlighting and
reconsidering and so on. But, it may be daunting to someone who is
used to using a GUI.</p><p>Now this is where the good guys from LyX come into play. They
developed a GUI for LaTeX, enabling the inexperienced user to take
advantage of the power of TeX without having to learn it from
scratch (yet).</p><p>Upon first glance, LyX may look similar to your average word
processor, but if you follow the tutorial, you will quickly see the
difference and how you can increase productivity by concentrating
on your work and material, rather than on the visual
representation.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4734f3.large.jpg"><img src="4734f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. A Screenshot of LyX</p></div></div>
</p><p>If you often connect to your machine remotely to get work
done, you don't always have the ability to export your display or
to forward X. This is when you learn to appreciate the power of the
command line&mdash;you find that everything you will ever need is right
there at your fingertips. By using your favorite editor (vim, in my
case) and LaTeX, you can get all your work done easily through a
single terminal to your machine.</p><p>Another advantage of LyX and LaTeX is that you can easily
export your files into platform-independent formats such as
PostScript or PDF. By combining the power of
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> with the power of LaTeX, this
can be done with just a few commands. Take, for example, this
document&mdash;I turned the input file into a beautiful PDF (Figure 4)
simply by using the command <b  >make pdf</b>.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4734f4.large.jpg"><img src="4734f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. This Document in Source and in PDF
Format</p></div></div>
</p><p>Even though the Makefile itself (see Listing 1) is simple, it
allows me to convert my document easily into a large variety of
output formats using several different command-line tools, such as
ps2pdf and latex2html.</p><p><a href="4734l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The Makefile for This
Document</a></p><p>Finally, LaTeX is extensible&mdash;you can write your own styles
to achieve different results depending on the kind of document you
are writing. But most likely, someone else has already done so and
uploaded it to the Comprehensive Tex Archive Network (CTAN, TeX's
equivalent to Perl's CPAN).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb58580.0xc49258"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In brief, whichever way you choose to handle your word
processing, the importance of conveying the information in a
portable document format needs to be expressed. Just try to make it
clear to the people with whom you correspond, to the people who
continually send you MS Word documents and then insist that you
&ldquo;fix your computer&rdquo; when you tell them that you can't open them
or that some formatting got lost. I have found that if one explains
in a friendly way how a PDF or a PS, for example, can be read by
anyone on almost every platform, occasionally one can educate all
but the most stubborn citizens of Winworld.</p><p>Personally, I'm sure you will find that LaTeX is far superior
even for these little everyday tasks when it comes to creating
professional (looking) documents. In order to take advantage of
LaTeX, however, it is necessary to free your mind from what you may
be used to. This may take awhile, but don't be afraid, there is a
lot of helpful documentation out there. Maybe the most important
document for a LaTeX beginner might be &ldquo;The Not So Short
Introduction to LaTeX2&rdquo;, available from Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network
(<a href="http://www.ctan.org" target="_self">www.ctan.org</a>).</p><p>After a short time of going through a tutorial and, most
importantly, giving it a try and taking a look at some examples,
you will never want to go back. You can take my Word for it.</p><p><a href="4734s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
