    Two students develop a solution to help get you in sync withyour palm device.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x151f7c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>A Palm is such a neat portable device.
You take notes on it, plan meetings or even write down
anniversaries. It's a nice tool to have while on the road. Our
intranet server, on the other hand, is also a great resource. We
have our company's planning and agenda on it, and it has all those
interesting notes, addresses and, in our case, a complete knowledge
database. This server runs (of course) Linux, an Apache web server
and MySQL database on top of it, glued together with a proprietary
application engine.
</p><p>Wouldn't it be great if the two environments could be
synchronized? Of course! Now if we could only access the internal
databases from the Palm on our Linux server, that would get us
pointed toward the right direction. Documentation is sparse and the
Internet is big. But then along came Kevin and Jeffrey, two
students who, with some effort, put together a solution that
allowed us to make changes on the Palm or on the corporate intranet
server and have these modifications propagated to one another's
counterpart databases.</p><p>All code below was tested on an Intel machine running a Red
Hat 6.x release and a Palm Vx with serial cradle running Palm OS
3.5, but other combinations shouldn't cause any problems. The
libraries used are unchanged since the first Palm appeared on the
market, when they were still being produced by 3Com. I suppose (but
haven't tested it) that Visor's won't cause any problem either, as
they are running the same OS.</p><p>Let's start with the simple part: connecting the Palm to the
server. First, we need to connect the cradle of the Palm with the
serial port of the server. Then we create a device called pilot.
This pilot is nothing more than a link to a serial port (in our
case /dev/ttyS0):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pilot
</pre><p>Now, we're ready to open the connection to the Palm using a C
program and a simple push on the HotSync button of the cradle. Once
the connection is made, we can relax and read records from the
Palm's databases.
</p><p>Communicating and opening the connection to the Palm is easy
with the pi library. This library simulates the BSD socket
interface: create a socket, bind it to our device, listen for an
incoming connection and accept it. The incoming connection is
initiated by the Palm/cradle combination when a user hits the sync
button on the cradle. Making a d&aelig;mon that waits for someone
to come by and synchronize its Palm is illustrated in Listing 1.
Loop this program forever.</p><p><a href="4821l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Synchronizing the
Palm</a></p><p>Once the connection is open, how do we interact with the Palm
databases? Each database on the Palm has a name. We can open a
database by name and get a specific record or cycle through the
database. On a Macintosh or Windows platform these functions are
performed by conduits. Palm itself provides a conduit on these
platforms for every standard database included with the Palm OS
bundle. The Palm database manager provides ways for us to cycle
only through the modified records in a database. Modified since
when? Well, since the last synchronization, the last time a server
committed this database. So, we should do this in our programs when
finished with the synchronization process. The lines in Listing 2
should be executed when the connection is open.</p><p><a href="4821l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Cycling through Modified
Records</a></p><p>Reading records from a Palm database doesn't qualify as
synchronizing. We'll need to do more, such as write to the Palm,
delete from it and read from our MySQL database. Since connecting
to a MySQL database is outside the scope of this article, we won't
discuss the further details of the synchronization problem (and the
possible conflicts). However, Kevin Velghe has written an excellent
document about it. You can read it at
<a href="http://www.duo.be/palm/mysql_palm.html" target="_self">www.duo.be/palm/mysql_palm.html</a>.</p><p>Records stored in a Palm database have unique numbers.
Whenever you write a record to the device, it returns this number.
You should store it on your desktop or central database, so that
you can delete or update a specific record.</p><p>The dlp_WriteRecord accepts a Palm ID. If it is zero, the
Palm OS will allocate a new one for you; if you pass an existing
ID, the corresponding record will be updated. For most standard
databases a pack function packs the structured record into a
buffer. This process is shown in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="4821l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Pack
Function</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x151fea0"></a>Identifying the Palm</h2></div></div><p>If, as in our case, you're serving multiple Palms on one
server/cradle, you'll need to find out whose Palm is in the cradle.
Once the connection is open, call the ReadUserInfo function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
  int db, len, I, attr;
  recordid_t id;
  struct PilotUser U;
</pre><p>...open the connection...
<pre     class="programlisting">
  sd = pi_accept(sd, 0, 0);
  dlp_ReadUserInfo(sd,&amp;U);
  printf("Palm of: %s", U.username);
  pi_close(sd);
}
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x15200b0"></a>Deleted Records</h2></div></div><p>The Palm database manager does not delete records
automatically when the records are read. It marks them for deletion
and even has the ability to mark them for archiving on the desktop
or server counterpart. When reading a modified record one should
check the attribute flag to see if this record needs to be deleted
(or archived). It will be deleted permanently on the Palm once the
database is cleaned up:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
  ...
  for (;;) {
    len = dlp_ReadNextModifiedRec(sd, db,
                       buffer, &amp;id, &amp;I,
                       0, &amp;attr, 0);
    if (len &lt; 0) break;
    if ((attr &amp; dlpRecAttrDeleted) ||
        (attr &amp; dlpRecAttrArchived))
      printf("Marked for deletion: %ld", id);
  }
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x1520210"></a>Some Logging Won't Hurt</h2></div></div><p>A good practice after synchronizing a Palm is to leave some
comment about it in the Palm's log. You can write whatever you
want, the time and date are added anyway. So, add the following
code to the end of your programs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
  ...
  dlp_ResetSyncFlags(sd, db);
  dlp_CleanUpDatabase(sd, db);
  dlp_CloseDB(sd, db);
  dlp_AddSyncLogEntry(sd,
    "Read modifications from Pilot.\n");
  pi_close(sd);
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1427580.0x1520370"></a>What You Need to Start Working</h2></div></div><p>To use your Pilot with a Linux box, get the pilot-link
package. The interfaces exist for many platforms, from Next, BSD,
Solaris, OS/2 to Linux. They let you write programs in many
languages from Python, Java, Perl, Tcl to C++ and C. The FTP site
<a href="http://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS" target="_self">ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS</a>
has the file you need: pilot-link.0.9.3.tar.gz.</p><p>It compiles on a Linux box without trouble. It is really more
than just an interface library containing a bunch of simple tools
that illustrate its use. These simple tools are very useful, enough
to back up a Pilot (and restore it), move data to and from it, send
e-mail, install programs and databases and so on. The library is
callable from C, C++, Perl, Python, Tcl and maybe a few other
languages; if you happen to have any programming ability, you can
craft tools to do anything you want, using the provided ones and
the sample code in this article as examples.</p><p>New programs, extra documentation, remarks or HOWTOs may be
submitted to palm@duo.be. We'll put them on the server available
for the public at
<a href="http://www.duo.be/palm" target="_self">www.duo.be/palm</a>.</p><p>Let's install the package by executing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvzf pilot-link.0.9.3.tar.gz
</pre><p>This will create a directory (pilot-link.0.9.3) containing
the sources. Change your working directory to the source
(pilot-link.0.9.3) directory.
</p><p>Run <b  >./configure</b>. This will search through
your system for information needed to compile the software.
Configure will set things up to be installed in /usr/local by
default. If you want to change it, run <b  >./configure
--prefix=DIR</b>, where DIR is replaced with the name of the
directory to which the software will be installed.</p><p>Run <b  >make</b>. This will compile the software.
The software will not be installed until later, so that you have a
chance to try it out first. If you are replacing an older version
with a newer release, you may wish to check to make sure that no
functionality you need has been broken. Generally, this is not a
problem.</p><p>As the root user, run <b  >make install</b>. This
will copy the software into directories under /usr/local (or
wherever you specified with the --prefix option). If you cannot log
in as root, you can install the software to some directory where
you have write access.</p><p>Don't forget to add any new directories of executables to
your search path. Check out all the neat tools installed together
with the libraries. For a description of some of them, take a look
at the article mentioned in Resources.</p><p><a href="4821s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
