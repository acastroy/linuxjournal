    A review of the first embedded Linux book to hit the shelves&mdash;a must-read for anyone interested in this subject.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x137c580.0x14745b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I first met John Lombardo at the Embedded
Internet Conference in August 2000. John told me he was working on
a book about embedded Linux, which would be published within a
year.
</p><p>In contrast to the inevitable lateness of so many software
releases, Lombardo's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Linux</em></span> (New
Riders, ISBN: 073570998X) hit the shelves of bookstores right on
schedule. As far as I know, it's the first and, at the time of this
writing, the only book published on this timely subject, thrusting
it very much into the spotlight and making it a must-read for all
developers (and many others) interested in exploring the subject of
embedding Linux.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Linux</em></span> covers a lot of
territory. There are four main sections: software, hardware,
application development and supplementary references. These
sections are further organized into ten chapters and four
appendices, including chapters on booting embedded Linux devices,
hardware considerations and testing and debugging.</p><p>The complete, detailed table of contents is available on-line
at
<a href="http://www.newriders.com/tocs/073570998X.pdf" target="_self">www.newriders.com/tocs/073570998X.pdf</a>.
A sample chapter was published by <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> in the May/June 2001 issue.</p><p>This 192-page book can be read comfortably in less than a
day, providing you don't launch into the step-by-step Embedded
Linux Workshop exercise (more on that later).</p><p>An exhaustive work on the subject of using Linux in embedded
systems and smart devices certainly could occupy a lot more pages.
Obviously, picking the right 192 pages' worth of information and
presenting it in an interesting, useful and well-written manner
must have presented a real challenge to the book's author&mdash;one that
he handled quite skillfully.</p><p>Another challenge, when you're putting together the first
book covering a hot new disruptive technology like embedded Linux,
is the race against time. First, there's the pressing need for a
book on the subject. Although several embedded Linux workshops and
training sessions are now available, only a few developers can
actually manage to attend them&mdash;a technically oriented book on
embedded Linux is in demand. Students, professionals and interested
onlookers are hungry for something to educate themselves about
embedded Linux. Another reason time is critical when producing a
book like this is the subject matter itself undergoes extremely
rapid change. Companies rise and fall. Distributions come and go.
New tools and capabilities arrive on the scene almost daily. The
time cycle in getting this type of book to market must be as short
as possible.</p><p>The book starts off with an excellent introduction to the
idea of using Linux as an embedded operating system, proceeds to
outline the options available for embedding Linux and then launches
into valuable discussion of how to design an embedded-based system
on Linux, including software, hardware and system-level
considerations. The book is chock-full of good, practical advice
for embedded developers in general, and especially for embedded
Linux developers.</p><p>After covering all the requisite software and hardware
fundamentals, Lombardo then settles down to the real meat of his
book: the Embedded Linux Workshop (ELW). The ELW is an open-source
embedded Linux toolkit that Lombardo created as a means to simplify
the process of building Linux-based embedded applications and to
serve as a companion project for his book.</p><p>Over 35 pages (including all of Chapters Seven and Eight) are
devoted to the ELW, including step-by-step instructions on how to
download the ELW toolkit and use it to implement a simple but real
embedded project&mdash;embedding Minicom. If you're interested in really
learning how to embed Linux, you'll find the sections on the ELW to
be extremely valuable as a way to understand fully the basics of
embedding Linux. The entire ELW toolkit is open source and can be
downloaded, configured and tested on any desktop PC. The ELW is
structured in a manner that the entire build process and all of the
associated software are exposed fully to study and scrutiny. What a
perfect project for a book like this!</p><p>Lombardo is clearly an embedded system developer, not a
marketing guy, and this book is about as far from marketing fluff
as you're likely to get. There are even sections called
&ldquo;Disadvantages of Open Source&rdquo; and &ldquo;When is Linux
Inappropriate?&rdquo; thrown in for balance. You certainly don't get the
sense that you're reading the words of a religious zealot.</p><p>In the words of the book's back cover, &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded
Linux</em></span> is intended for designers of embedded systems and
information appliances, as well as for general Linux programmers.&rdquo;
This includes not only software developers, but system developers
as well. Even hardware engineers can find much of value in this
book, thanks to several sections devoted to system design issues
and debug considerations. It's also full of useful information on
the techniques and issues associated with developing and supporting
embedded systems in general. In short, I think anyone wanting to
become more familiar with the concepts of embedded system
development can benefit from reading this book, although
nonprogrammers will find themselves skipping past several large
chunks of code-intensive material. (Being more of a system/hardware
guy, I just close my eyes during the scary software parts.)</p><p>Overall, I found <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded Linux</em></span> to be
easy and enjoyable reading (other than the aforementioned scary
parts) and packed with useful information. It provides insight into
embedded system development issues&mdash;good coverage of fundamentals
of embedded system architecture design, including things like
selecting hardware and software, system architecture trade-offs,
make vs. buy issues, etc. It's also a good source of great
tips/techniques/tricks on embedded software development&mdash;the author
shares his considerable experience as an embedded system developer
throughout the book, in the form of a steady stream of suggestions,
tricks and caveats to help developers simplify and accelerate their
embedded projects.</p><p>On the negative side, the book has a limited breadth of
resources. Although it provides a good general introduction to
embedded Linux, it seems a bit thin when it comes to lists of
options and alternatives. Perhaps it would have been better to
focus less on a single commercial embedded Linux toolkit
(LynuxWorks BlueCat) and instead provide brief overviews of perhaps
half a dozen of the major alternatives, along with their
differentiating characteristics (a comparison table of distros
would be really nice).</p><p>Potential for confusion exists between embedded Linux
&ldquo;distribution&rdquo; and &ldquo;toolkit&rdquo;--in my opinion, the author blurs
the distinction between embedded Linux distributions, such as Lineo
Embedix, MontaVista Hard Hat and LynuxWorks BlueCat, and embedded
Linux toolkits. He defines toolkits as &ldquo;designed to simplify the
job of building the binary that runs your device&rdquo;. Products such
as Embedix, Hard Hat and BlueCat, which are called toolkits in the
book, contain both a Linux OS and toolkits for building target OS
binaries. The Embedded Linux Workshop is appropriately termed a
toolkit because it doesn't include things like the Linux kernel,
compiler, libraries, GNU utilities, etc. For that reason, I would
prefer to see the commercial products called embedded Linux
distributions, since they include both toolkits and the GNU/Linux
OS.</p><p>Also, ELW coverage needs restructuring&mdash;given the
extraordinary utility of the ELW, I would suggest that it might
make sense to break the chapters on the ELW out into a separate
section of the book and expand that coverage a bit. I suspect the
ELW could be the subject of its own 192-page book, especially once
its SourceForge project takes off.</p><p>In summary, I give John Lombardo's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded
Linux</em></span> a &ldquo;3.5 Tux&rdquo; rating (on a scale of 4). It's
first-to-market, well structured, has a lot of useful information
and deserves high accolades for the excellent Embedded Linux
Workshop and associated step-by-step examples.</p><p><a href="5427s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
