<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #281, September 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Miroslav Lichvar</b></span> recently submitted some patches to improve the accuracy
of the <span   class="bold"><b>Linux system clock</b></span>. Nowadays, the Linux clock generally
is synchronized periodically with internet sources like everything else,
but it's still nice to have a high degree of accuracy during the time
in between synchronizations.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>John Stultz</b></span> liked the code, but he wanted to include Miroslav's test suite
in the kernel as well, so that other developers could make sure future
patches didn't spoil system clock accuracy. And, this turned out to be
the biggest point of contention in the discussion thread.
</p><p>
Miroslav felt that his test suite&mdash;which really had been
written only for his own use&mdash;was ugly, breakable and just bad news all
around. However, John felt that its value outweighed all those things,
and that its presence in the kernel would encourage others to improve
the suite over time.
</p><p>
Eventually, they compromised. Miroslav wrote a new, more robust
and maintainable test suite that was slower, less precise and less
predictable than the original, but that still essentially did the job.
It was a rare case where the quality of a feature takes a back seat to a
developer's need to be able to hold his head up.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span>, the <span   class="bold"><b>firmware</b></span> maintainer, noticed that bugs were
creeping into the kernel firmware code, just because the folks submitting
patches weren't sure who to cc. Patches, thus, were getting lost in the
vast ocean of linux-kernel email. The patches themselves often would be
reviewed and approved, but without the eyeballs that really could ferret
out any troublesome breakages. Luis wanted to start a new mailing list,
just for firmware.
</p><p>
The idea went nowhere, fast. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Boutique mailing lists
are generally a <span   class="emphasis"><em>bad</em></span> thing. All it means is that there's an increasingly
small &ldquo;in group&rdquo; that thinks that they generate consensus because nobody
disagrees with their small boutique list, because nobody else even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sees</em></span>
that small list. We should only have mailing lists if they really merit
the volume, and are big enough that there are lots of users.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And, this judgment stood even though, as Luis pointed out, many device
drivers had their own mailing lists, in spite of their having extremely
low traffic. As <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> put it, device drivers were not part of
the core kernel infrastructure that everyone relied on. Firmware support,
like other parts of the kernel, needed to be broadly scrutinized.
</p><p>
Of course, this was in conflict with Luis' original point&mdash;that
patches were not being scrutinized enough because they'd get lost in
the vastness of the main mailing list.
</p><p>
Even so, it seems that Linus, David, Greg and others want maintainers
to find other solutions to that problem&mdash;perhaps by documenting a
list of people to be cc'd on all patches within a given area of
code&mdash;or perhaps something else. But, they definitely seem to want to avoid
diluting the main linux-kernel mailing list traffic if at all possible.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Containers</b></span> are weird. The whole idea is to pretend that you've got a
virtual system running on top of a Linux box, just by isolating certain
resources on that box and having them all act like they're a box of their
own. You even could create virtual systems that are crippled or enhanced
in bizarre ways, just because they match the specific requirements
of a crazy new project you've got in mind. At the same time, the
virtualization process itself creates a wide range of feature constraints
and security caveats that always must be navigated properly. And, the whole
implementation of containers is something that has to happen gradually
over time because it's so nuanced and wide-ranging throughout the full
breadth of the kernel, so that Linux has been approaching better and
better virtualization during a course of years.
</p><p>
So, when <span   class="bold"><b>David Howells</b></span> wanted to implement a standardized container
&ldquo;object&rdquo; that would wrangle all aspects of containers into a single,
easy-to-use set of functions, he encountered nearly universal resistance.
</p><p>
In theory, it's a great idea. All the little niggling details of
containers can cause odd security relationships, strange communication
requirements and odd filesystem structures. Trying to smooth all of
that out and give it a clean face seems like a natural next step,
as containers become more and more robust.
</p><p>
But, <span   class="bold"><b>James Bottomley</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Jessica Frazelle</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Aleksa
Sarai</b></span> and others felt
that David was smoothing things about a bit too much and making too many
assumptions about the kind of strange uses one might have for containers.
</p><p>
Ultimately, folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Eric W.
Biederman</b></span> started proposing alternatives to
David's approach that would be more flexible, and the discussion ended
up being less about David's patches and more about how to implement
the features that the people raising their objections seemed to want.
</p><p>
Eventually, some sort of container management system probably will go
into the kernel, though there are also projects like <span   class="bold"><b>Docker</b></span> that attempt
to fill that role. But as David remarked at a few different points, any
in-kernel solution will be highly generic, more likely to be relied on
by things like Docker, than to replace them.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: BookSonic Mobile</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #281, September 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This month's Editors' Choice award goes to the cool book streaming system
BookSonic by Patrik Johansson. Johansson also created an Android app that
connects to the BookSonic server, and it has some extra features the web
interface lacks. Namely, it can save your place in a book, and it appears
to have multiple speed playback.
</p><p>
Because it's based on the SubSonic system, there already are some great
features included, such as caching for offline playback. I personally
couldn't get the multi-speed playback to work, but it might be something
I configured incorrectly on the server. Nevertheless, to experience
BookSonic truly in all its glory, you must download the mobile client. It is a
$3 purchase from the Google Play Store, but the source code is available
on the author's GitHub page (<a href="https://github.com/popeen/Popeens-DSub" target="_self">https://github.com/popeen/Popeens-DSub</a>),
if you want to compile it yourself. Check it out!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224bookf1.large.jpg"><img src="12224bookf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Note: if you're using the Docker image to run the BookSonic server, be
sure to use the following server URL when adding it to the Android app:
http://your.docker.server.address:8080/booksonic.
</p><p>
The documentation doesn't mention the need for the trailing /booksonic,
but without it, you'll get a connection error.

<h2 class="title">Evolving Your Own Life</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #281, September 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Much of the software I've covered through the years in this
column has been focused on engineering, chemistry or physics. However, there is
a growing number of software packages that are being written to apply
computational resources to problems in biology. So in this article, I'm 
looking at one particular package for biology named Biogenesis. 
Biogenesis provides
a platform where you can create entire ecosystems of lifeforms and see
how they interact and how the system as a whole evolves over time. 
</p><p>
You
always can get the latest version from the project's main website
(<a href="http://biogenesis.sourceforge.net" target="_self">biogenesis.sourceforge.net</a>), but
it also should be available in the package management systems for most
distributions. For Debian-based distributions, install Biogenesis
with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install biogenesis
</pre>
</p><p>
If you do download it directly from the project website, you also
will need to have a Java virtual machine installed in order to run it. 
</p><p>
To
start it, you either can find the appropriate entry in the menu of
your desktop environment, or you simply can type
<tt  >biogenesis</tt> in
a terminal window. When it first starts, you will
get an empty window within which to create your world.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224biof1.large.jpg"><img src="12224biof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start Biogenesis, you get a blank canvas so you
can start creating your world.
</p></div></div><p>
The first step is to create a world. If you have a previous
instance that you want to continue with, click the
Game&rarr;Open menu item and select the appropriate file. If you want to start
fresh, click Game&rarr;New to get a new world with a
random selection of organisms. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224biof2.large.jpg"><img src="12224biof2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. When you launch a new world, you get a random selection of
organisms to start your ecosystem.
</p></div></div><p>
The world starts right away, with organisms moving and potentially
interacting immediately. However, you can pause the world by clicking
on the icon that is second from the right in the toolbar. Alternatively, you
also can just press the p key to pause and resume the evolution of the
world. 
</p><p>
At the bottom of the window, you'll find details about the world
as it currently exists. There is a display of the frames per second,
along with the current time within the world. Next, there is a count of
the current population of organisms. And finally, there is a display of the
current levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. You can adjust the amount of
carbon dioxide within the world either by clicking the relevant icon in
the toolbar or selecting the World menu item and then clicking either
Increase CO2 or Decrease CO2. 
</p><p>
There also are several parameters
that govern how the world works and how your organisms will fare. If you
select World&rarr;Parameters, you'll see a new window
where you can play with those values. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12224biof3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The parameter configuration window allows you to set parameters
on the physical characteristics of the world, along with parameters that
control the evolution of your organisms.
</p></div></div><p>
The General tab
sets the amount of time per frame and whether hardware acceleration
is used for display purposes. The World tab lets you set the physical
characteristics of the world, such as the size and the initial oxygen and
carbon dioxide levels. The Organisms tab allows you to set the initial
number of organisms and their initial energy levels. You also can set
their life span and mutation rate, among other items. The Metabolism tab
lets you set the parameters around photosynthetic metabolism. And, the Genes
tab allows you to set the probabilities and costs for the various genes
that can be used to define your organisms.
</p><p>
What about the organisms within your world though? If you click
on one of the organisms, it will be highlighted and the display will
change. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224biof4.large.jpg"><img src="12224biof4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can select individual organisms to find information
about them, as well as apply different types of actions.
</p></div></div><p>
The icon toolbar at the top of the window will
change to provide actions that apply to organisms. At the bottom of the
window is an information bar describing the selected organism. It
shows physical characteristics of the organism, such as age,
energy and mass. It also describes its relationships to
other organisms. It does this by displaying the number of its children and
the number of its victims, as well as which generation it is. 
</p><p>
If you
want even more detail about an organism, click the Examine
genes button in the bottom bar. This pops up a new window called the
Genetic Laboratory that allows you to look at and alter the genes making up this organism. You can add or delete genes,
as well as change the parameters of existing genes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224biof5.large.jpg"><img src="12224biof5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Genetic Laboratory allows you to play with the individual
genes that make up an organism.
</p></div></div><p>
Right-clicking on a particular organism displays a drop-down menu
that provides even more tools to work with. The first one allows you to
track the selected organism as the world evolves. The next two entries
allow you either to feed your organism extra food or weaken it.
Normally, organisms need a certain amount of energy before
they can reproduce. Selecting the fourth entry forces the selected
organism to reproduce immediately, regardless of the energy level. You
also can choose either to rejuvenate or outright kill the selected
organism. If you want to increase the population of a particular
organism quickly, simply copy and paste a number of a given organism.
</p><p>
Once you have a particularly interesting organism, you likely will want
to be able to save it so you can work with it further. When you
right-click an organism, one of the options is to export the organism to
a file. This pops up a standard save dialog box where you can select the
location and filename. The standard file ending for Biogenesis genetic
code files is .bgg. Once you start to have a collection of organisms
you want to work with, you can use them within a given world by
right-clicking a blank location on the canvas and selecting the import
option. This allows you to pull those saved organisms back into a world
that you are working with.
</p><p>
Once you have allowed your world to evolve for a while, you probably
will want to see how things are going. Clicking 
World&rarr;Statistics will pop up a new window where you can see what's
happening within your world. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224biof6.large.jpg"><img src="12224biof6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The statistics window gives you a breakdown of what's
happening within the world you have created.
</p></div></div><p>
The top of the window
gives you the current statistics, including the time, the number
of organisms, how many are dead, and the oxygen and carbon dioxide
levels. It also provides a bar with the relative proportions of
the genes. 
</p><p>
Below this pane is a list of some remarkable organisms within
your world. These are organisms that have had the most children, the most
victims or those that are the most infected. This way, you can focus on organisms that
are good at the traits you're interested in. 
</p><p>
On the right-hand side
of the window is a display of the world history to date. The top
portion displays the history of the population, and the bottom portion
displays the history of the atmosphere. As your world continues evolving,
click the update button to get the latest statistics.
</p><p>
This software package could be a great teaching tool for learning
about genetics, the environment and how the two interact. If
you find a particularly interesting organism, be sure 
to share it with the community at the project website. It might
be worth a look there for starting organisms too, allowing you to jump-start your explorations.

<h2 class="title">Build Your Own Audible</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #281, September 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have audiobooks from a variety of sources, which I've purchased in a
variety of ways. I have some graphic audio books in MP3 format, a bunch
of Audible books in their DRM'd format and ripped CDs varying from m4b
(Apple format for books) to MP3 and even some OGG. That diversity makes
choosing a listening platform difficult. In order to meet my idea of
perfection, I need:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A system that plays any audio format.
</p></li><li><p>
A way to play books on multiple platforms, iOS Android and web browsers.
</p></li><li><p>
Current location stored and honored across platforms.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to play audiobooks at different speeds.
</p></li><li><p>
An easy way to access my entire library remotely.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Several options come close. My favorite Android audiobook app, for
instance, is &ldquo;Listen&rdquo;, available in the Play Store. But, it falls short on the
multi-platform front and also on accessing books remotely. Audible itself
will do most of what I need, but it doesn't allow importing remote
books. And, traditional music players are out.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224bookf1.large.jpg"><img src="12224bookf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Honestly, Plex seems like the perfect platform for audiobooks. And although
some people do use it, they're just kludging things. Plex doesn't natively
support the concepts behind audiobooks, so the process isn't smooth at
all. I'm honestly hoping that changes in the future, because it would
be a perfect addition to an already amazing system. Thankfully, in the
meantime, there's BookSonic.
</p><p>
You've probably heard of SubSonic, which is a music streaming server that
allows you to do pretty much what I'm looking for with audiobooks, but it's strictly for
music. Patrik Johansson (<a href="https://github.com/popeen" target="_self">https://github.com/popeen</a>) has forked SubSonic
and created BookSonic, specifically modified to handle audiobooks. It
even handles tagging and book art. Currently, the system isn't perfect,
but it's closer than any other projects come to book nirvana, and if
you use Docker, it's dead simple to get installed. A simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

docker -d create \
  --name booksonic \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v &lt;path/to/storage/location/on/host&gt;:/audiobooks \
  -v &lt;path/to/configuration/on/host&gt;:/var/booksonic \
  ironicbadger/booksonic

</pre>
</p><p>
will get BookSonic running on your Docker host. Once it's installed,
just head over to http://docker_host:8080 and log in as admin/admin. You
can start the book scan, and fairly soon, your books will show up for
you to start playing!
</p><p>
Many things about BookSonic do need work (syncing locations
to the web client and so on), but it's a great start, and it's a wonderful way
to access all your books in one place. Well, as long as you figure
out how to strip the DRM from your Audible books anyway! BookSonic is
such a great idea, and fills such a gaping hole, that even with its
not-feature-complete release, it gets this month's Editors' Choice
Award. For more details, head over to <a href="http://booksonic.org" target="_self">booksonic.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Caps0ff</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #281, September 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It's no secret that I love classic video games. Fortunately, thanks to
emulation, many of the classic arcade games still can be enjoyed and
forever will be available via digital copies of the ROM chips. Sadly,
some older systems have protection, making them impossible
to dump into ROMs properly. If the chips can't be dumped, how will
you ever get a digital copy of the ROM data? Well, the folks over at
the <a href="http://caps0ff.blogspot.com" target="_self">caps0ff.blogspot.com</a> blog actually are disassembling the
original chips and painstakingly transcribing the contents one bit at
a time. They're literally looking at the chips and determining the 1s
and 0s burned onto them.
</p><p>
Yes, there are a lot of chips. Yes, it takes a long time to copy the
bits one by one. And yes, you can help. When a chip is stripped down
literally to its bits (using various acid baths and so forth), it is scanned at
high resolution. Then, pieces of the chips are put into a database over
at <a href="https://cs.sipr0n.org" target="_self">https://cs.sipr0n.org</a>, and people like you and me can transcribe the
photos into 1s and 0s for the project!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12224fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This is a sample of the interface for identifying 1s and 0s
on the scanned chips.
</p></div></div><p>
Having the underlying code doesn't automatically make your favorite
non-dumpable games work in MAME or anything, but it's a crucial and
difficult first step. It's also a fairly pricey step, because the chips
need to be procured, and the chemicals need to be purchased. If you are
passionate enough about preserving the old chips, you might consider
donating money to the Caps0ff project as well. There's a great one-time
donation site on Indiegogo with an explanation of the project:
<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/caps0ff#" target="_self">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/caps0ff#</a>. And, if you want to

360&deg; photos aren't a new concept, but if you're on Facebook,
you'll notice they're more and more common. In fact, Facebook now
will convert panoramic photos into a sort of 180&deg; experience where you
can drag the photo to see left and right. With a true 360&deg; photo, you
literally can spin the photo in a circle to see everywhere. If you're
on a mobile device, the experience becomes a sort of VR thing, where if
you turn while looking at the phone, it will pan the image for you, as
if you're peering through into another world. Honestly, it's pretty cool.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12224thetaf1.large.jpg"><img src="12224thetaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
In order to get the really nice 360&deg; photos, you need a camera, or set of
cameras, able to accomplish it. The easiest cameras are simple point
(well, pointing is sort of moot) and shoot ones. The more complex multi-camera
setups require photo stitching after the fact. I like the Ricoh Theta
SC camera. It's a happy medium when it comes to quality, and the photos
it takes are high enough resolution to appreciate the experience. There
is a more expensive Ricoh Theta S, but the photo quality is similar,
so unless you want to record 360&deg; video, the SC is perfect.
</p><p>
Admittedly, connecting Android via Wi-Fi to the Theta camera is a pain in
the butt, and it rarely works. There are several apps in the Play Store,
and it's not clear which app to get. I ultimately skipped using
my phone as a viewfinder and just stuck the camera in the air and
snapped. Afterward, I downloaded the photos via USB to my computer and
uploaded them from there. You can create a free account on <a href="http://theta360.com" target="_self">theta360.com</a> to
host your photos, or you can upload them to Twitter, Facebook and so on. If you
head to <a href="https://theta360.com/s/jCOnQ36A8nmw03lzQKgmQw7km" target="_self">https://theta360.com/s/jCOnQ36A8nmw03lzQKgmQw7km</a>, you can see
a barn my wife and I looked at. The 360&deg; experience really makes looking
at photos more immersive, and I'm excited to see where the technology
goes from here!
