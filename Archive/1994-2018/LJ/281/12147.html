Deploy an app from the ground up with Linux and open-source software.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab1250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Do a quick search of Indeed, Dice or your favorite job site, and
you'll quickly discover the massive demand for full stack developers,
with salaries on the rise for talented men and women who are equally
comfortable with back-end and front-end development. Linux and free,
open-source software provide all the tools you need to do your own full
stack experimenting, and the project described here will give you a taste of doing
it all.
</p><p>
In this project, you'll build a little app for keeping track of all
the books you've read and want to read. Think of it as your own digital
library tool not tied to Amazon or any other online book shop. You'll
start by setting up a LAMP server (on a virtual machine, bare metal or
a cloud-based virtual private server); tap into the public Google Books
API; take advantage of GitHub; and write a little PHP, jQuery, CSS and
SQL. At the end, you'll have a working app and a better understanding
of the big-picture thinking of a full stack developer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab1460"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
For this project, you'll use some common, readily available software
that will be familiar to anyone who's tinkered with Linux. For the OS,
you'll deploy Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, but feel free to use any flavor you
prefer. The rest of the software you'll use is well tested on literally
any flavor of Linux you can think of.
</p><p>
You'll install apache2, MySQL, PHP, git (so you can pull and push your
project from and to GitHub) and Adminer, a handy browser-based tool
for graphically managing databases. If you happen to have a domain name
you want to point to your server, that will be helpful, but I won't
cover domain configuration in detail. I recommend using a domain because
it'll help you dig into the apache2 configuration, an important full
stack developer skill.
</p><p>
Once the host is set up (and secured), you'll create accounts on
GitHub and Google Cloud Platform. The former isn't strictly necessary
if you're just cloning my jtonello/booklist repository, but again, I
think a tool like GitHub will serve you well as you begin to grow your
code base and start branching out. Google Cloud Platform is required
so you can take advantage of Google's massive books database at the
heart of this project. Real-time API calls to Google Books will return
a flood of data that you can use for this and other projects.
</p><p>
Finally, you'll start writing the application itself, something I've
called &ldquo;My Library&rdquo;. You can name it what you want and even open it
up to multiple users. Just like any software developer, you'll focus on
how to make your app work for any number of users, not just as a one-off
bit of stuff for yourself. It'll have PHP at its core, and you'll use
the JavaScript framework jQuery, create a user-friendly layout with CSS,
decode some JSON and do some simple debugging and refactoring.
</p><p>
Before wrapping it all up, I'll offer a few ways you can build out your
app and make it your own. You can change the layout; make a mechanism
for adding users; link your tool to booksellers like Amazon, Barnes &amp;
Noble or AbeBooks.com; or follow your own path.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab1720"></a>
The Host</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, it all begins with the host&mdash;the server that will become
the home for your app. Ironically, many developers 
who are quite good at software development never really got
their hands on setting up a server. Maybe their company has an operations
group responsible for that, or maybe they were just given credentials to
some server and never had to think about it too much.
</p><p>
To get started setting up the server, download the Ubuntu 16.04 .iso
for the architecture you have (32- or 64-bit). If you plan to build this
project on a virtual machine&mdash;anything from VMware to VirtualBox to
Proxmox&mdash;you'll use this .iso file to install the OS. If you're
using Proxmox or other free KVM-based VM host, you can use a prebuilt
Linux container, or LXC. (For more on this, check out my Tiny Internet
Project; see Resources for the URLs.)
</p><p>
If you're turning an old PC or laptop into your server, you'll need
to burn the .iso to a USB thumbdrive or DVD and boot your system. If
all you have is an old 32-bit PC, no matter. It'll work great for this
project too. Just make sure to download the right version of the Ubuntu .iso
for your platform.
</p><p>
More recently, I've started experimenting with VPS hosts&mdash;virtual
private servers. Unlike web hosting, VPS offer you very inexpensive
full-fledged Linux hosts. You can choose the Linux flavor you like, get
root access to the whole server and pay as little as $3 a month. Some
good VPS hosts include DigitalOcean, Linode and VirMach.
</p><p>
I've included a bunch of handy links about VPS hosts and more in the
Resources section at the end of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab1988"></a>
Install the OS</h2></div></div><p>
If you've never installed Ubuntu (or whatever Linux distro you're
using) from scratch, you'll find the process pretty painless
these days. When you boot from the .iso, just follow the on-screen
instructions. When you get to the screen asking which packages to install,
select only ssh-server. If you're short on time, you can select the
LAMP stack option too and skip ahead to the Apache configuration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f1.large.jpg"><img src="12147f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Ubuntu Package Installation Screen
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab1c48"></a>
Networking</h2></div></div><p>
If you're creating your host on a VM on a computer attached to your home
network, the setup probably will grab an IP address from your router's
DHCP server. If not, you'll have to assign an address manually. Of
course, any hosted solution will provide you with the IP address.
</p><p>
Once the installation is complete, log in as the user you created during
setup and check your IP address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ifconfig
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f2.large.jpg"><img src="12147f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Running <tt >ifconfig</tt> returns your IP address and active network
interface.
</p></div></div><p>
Note the IP address of your host and jot it down. Next, test your network
connectivity with a quick ping:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ping google.com
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't get results, something's wrong with your
networking. Check /etc/network/interfaces and look at the Resources
link on how to troubleshoot.
</p><p>
If you haven't already added a user account with root privileges
(Ubuntu creates this user during install), go ahead and do that now:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# adduser jjohnson
</pre>
</p><p>
Answer the on-screen questions, starting with a password. When you're
back at the prompt, add your new user to the sudo and www-data groups:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# adduser jjohnson sudo www-data
</pre>
</p><p>
Log out of the root shell and log in with your new user account. From now
on, you'll prefix your commands with <tt  >sudo</tt> instead of operating in the
more hazardous superuser account. 
</p><p>
Test your sudo privileges by making
sure openssh-server is installed. If you selected it during install,
it'll be there. If not, simply run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt install openssh-server
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, run updates:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y

</pre>
</p><p>
Now that your system is up to date, install
<tt  >iptables-persistent</tt> so you
can set up firewall rules. iptables is a very common and robust way to
manage network access to your host. If you're toying around in a lab
on your home network, setting up iptables isn't strictly necessary,
but anywhere else, it's important to protect your system from intrusion:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt install iptables-persistent
</pre>
</p><p>
The default iptables rules are set to make your host wide open,
accepting traffic from anywhere to any port on your machine. That's
dangerous. You'll want to prevent access to your host from outside, so
you'll create iptables INPUT rules. So, let's say you want to allow
traffic on port 80 (http) from everywhere, and all traffic, regardless of
port, to the host from your private network, which might be any machine
with an IP address in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255. You'd
add rules like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
And then add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
The rules are saved in /etc/iptables/rules.v4. To apply them, you can
use iptables' <tt  >save</tt> command, but for now, just reboot to make these
rules permanent.
</p><p>
Of course, these are very basic iptables examples, but enough to
get you started. Adding similar rules in /etc/iptables/rules.v6 will
protect your host from unwanted IPv6 traffic too. Check the Resources
section at the end of this article for links to other good references.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab27f8"></a>
Install Apache, MySQL and PHP</h2></div></div><p>
If you selected the LAMP software package during installation, you can
skip this next part. If not, manually install the apache2 web server,
the MySQL database and PHP with the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt install apache2ctl
$ sudo apt install mysql-server
$ sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mcrypt 
 &#8618;php-mysql
</pre>
</p><p>
The last command installs PHP and gives it hooks into both Apache and
MySQL so it serves up pages properly.
</p><p>
Apache configuration files live in /etc/apache2/. The key files are
apache2.conf and /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf. Also,
look in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and see how the 000-default.conf file
there is just a link to the file in sites-available:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -la /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
</pre>
</p><p>
Open and look at each of these files, which contain default settings
for a single default website (see Resources for more details).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2ab2ab8"></a>
Test Your Connection</h2></div></div><p>
Before going on to the next step, you should test to make sure that you have
network access to your host machine, that your web server is running, that
you can shell in from another machine and that PHP is working properly.
</p><p>
First, test the web server. When you installed apache2, it set up a
default website and enabled it for you. If your host is 192.168.1.18,
you can point your browser to http://192.168.1.18, and you should see the
default &ldquo;It works!&rdquo; page.
</p><p>
Next, shell in to your host. If you're coming from another Linux machine
or a Mac, use the built-in terminal application. If you're on Windows,
download PuTTY and use that to shell in (see Resources for
more on PuTTY):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh 192.169.1.18
</pre>
</p><p>
To test PHP, shell in to your new web server and create a small info.php
file in /var/www/html that contains the simple
<tt  >phpinfo</tt> function.
</p><p>
Use vi or nano, built-in Linux text editors, to create and edit
the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ sudo vi /var/www/html/info.php

&lt;?php

    phpinfo();

?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Save and exit, and point your browser to http://your-host/info.php. You
should see the welcoming purple PHP configuration page. The fact that
it shows up is all you need to know that PHP is installed and ready to
go. Best to delete the info.php file before proceeding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2aa9768"></a>
Database and Repository Tools</h2></div></div><p>
Now you're ready to install Adminer, a handy browser-based tool
for managing databases and tables, and git, the document repository
you'll use to pull down the My Library app itself:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt install adminer
$ sudo apt install git
</pre>
</p><p>
The package that installs Adminer places it in /usr/share/adminer,
so you have to do a couple things to make it available from your web
server. First set up the configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo echo "Alias /adminer.php /usr/share/adminer/adminer.php" 
 &#8618;| sudo tee /etc/apache2/conf-available/adminer.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
This copies the Adminer configuration to your Apache configuration
directory. Enable it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo a2enconf adminer.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
Create a symbolic link from the adminer directory to your website:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ln -s /usr/share/adminer/adminer/ /var/www/html/adminer
</pre>
</p><p>
If all goes well, you can point your browser to http://your-host/adminer
and log in with the user name root and the password you created when you
installed mysql-server above.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f3.large.jpg"><img src="12147f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Use the credentials you created during the mysql-server installation to log in to Adminer.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2aa9ce8"></a>
Set Up External Accounts</h2></div></div><p>
At the heart of the My Library app you're about to deploy is Google's
booklist database, and in order to use it, you need a Google Cloud Platform
account. If you have a Gmail account, adding a cloud account is free and
simple. Just go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com" target="_self">https://console.cloud.google.com</a> and set yourself up.
</p><p>
You'll notice that this account gives you a lot more than just access
to Google APIs, including Google's cloud solution, Compute Engine. For
now though, you just want to enable and manage the book API. On the
main dashboard page, look for the link under &ldquo;Use Google
APIs&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Click &ldquo;Library&rdquo; in the left-hand column or the &ldquo;Enable
API&rdquo; link
at the top of the page to see the full list of available APIs. Search
for &ldquo;book&rdquo;, and click the &ldquo;Google Books API&rdquo; link. At the top
of the page, click the &ldquo;Enable&rdquo; button.
</p><p>
The API is almost ready to use, but first you need to create
credentials. Click the &ldquo;Create credentials&rdquo; button and answer the
questions. You'll be calling the API from a &ldquo;Web server&rdquo; and using
&ldquo;Public data&rdquo;. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f4.large.jpg"><img src="12147f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Google Cloud Platform API Dashboard
</p></div></div><p>
When you click &ldquo;What credentials do I need&rdquo;, you'll be taken to
a screen and shown your new API key. Copy that down; you'll need it
later in your app. Check the Quotas tab to look at your daily limits for
this API. The free version gives you 1,000 queries a day. That should be
plenty, but if you accidentally build a loop function that makes dozens
of calls to the API each second, you'll use up your day's worth in
a hurry.
</p><p>
With these pieces in place, I recommend you create a GitHub account,
although an account isn't required for this project, only git is. As
public repositories go, it's a good one, and it will get you in the
habit of thinking about the code you create in versions that can be
branched and shared. Keep in mind though that the default for GitHub
is public. Your projects will be freely available&mdash;and seen&mdash;by
anyone. If you want your code to be private, you have to pay for that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2aaa528"></a>
Building the Application</h2></div></div><p>
So far, you've set up a host, installed the core applications you
need to serve up your web app and prepared a public API source for
use. It's now time to deploy the code.
</p><p>
Start by setting up the MySQL database and the three tables you'll need
to run the application. You can do this from the command line by
<tt  >ssh</tt>-ing
in to your host and logging in to MySQL using the credentials you created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mysql -u root -p
</pre>
</p><p>
If you've never done this before though, it can be a little taxing to
manage the database and tables from the command line. Instead, use your
MySQL credentials to log in to the Adminer tool (http://your-host/adminer).
</p><p>
On Adminer's main dashboard, select &ldquo;Create new database&rdquo;, give it
the name &ldquo;booklist&rdquo;, and set collation to
&ldquo;utf8_general_ci&rdquo;. Of
course, you can call the database whatever you want, but I'll be
referencing &ldquo;booklist&rdquo; in the PHP code.
</p><p>
Create a new user for the booklist database by clicking the
&ldquo;Privileges&rdquo; link in the &ldquo;Server&rdquo; view. Set
&ldquo;Server&rdquo; to
&ldquo;localhost&rdquo; and &ldquo;Username&rdquo; to
&ldquo;webuser&rdquo;. Add a password. I
like to give a user like this just the privileges it needs, so under the
<tt  >'booklist '.*</tt> column, check the &ldquo;Select,
Update and Insert&rdquo;
boxes under Table and Column, and &ldquo;Delete&rdquo; under Table. Click save.
</p><p>
With the database created, you need to create three tables: 
one to hold information about each book;
one to hold information about your library, and
one for users. 
</p><p>
The books table will hold the core information about each book, and
the library table will hold each user's information about that
book&mdash;namely, whether it's been read or wishlisted.
</p><p>
The books table has the following fields, types and sizes, with the ISBN
used as the unique ID field and primary key:

<pre     class="programlisting">
isbn	varchar(40)
title	varchar(120)
author	varchar(120)
selfLink	varchar(255)
publishddate	year(4)
saveddate	timestamp[CURRENT_TIMESTAMP]
thumbnail	varchar(255)
description	mediumtext
</pre>
</p><p>
Most of these fields are self-explanatory, but it's worth describing
<tt  >selfLink</tt> and <tt  >thumbnail</tt>. The Google API offers up these fields and it's
nice to save them locally. <tt  >selfLink</tt> is a URL that points to the book in
the Google database, which displays details, bibliographic information and
more. The <tt  >thumbnail</tt> field is a URL that points to the image the Google
API has associated with the book. The thumbnail URLs will give you a
good way to dress up your library app and make it more
user-friendly.
</p><p>
Next, create the &ldquo;library&rdquo; table and its five fields:

<pre     class="programlisting">
isbn    varchar(40)
user_id varchar(50)
readit  tinyint(1)
wishlist    tinyint(1)
saveddate   timestamp[CURRENT_TIMESTAMP]
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >user_id</tt> field is large enough to store an email address, which
will be each user's unique ID. The primary key though, will be a
composite of <tt  >isbn</tt> and
<tt  >user_id</tt>. That's so different users can tag the
same book. To create the composite key, click &ldquo;SQL command&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Table: library&rdquo; view and execute the following SQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ALTER TABLE library DROP PRIMARY KEY, ADD PRIMARY 
 &#8618;KEY(isbn,user_id);
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >readit</tt> and <tt  >wishlist</tt> fields will contain either a 1
or 0, integers set when users add books to their libraries.
</p><p>
Finally, create the users table, which sets the
<tt  >user_id</tt> field as the
primary key:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user_id	varchar(50)
first_name    varchar(30)
last_name     varchar(30)
</pre>
</p><p>
After you've created the users table, click the &ldquo;New item&rdquo; link to
create your first entry. Use your own email and name. Set the password
type to &ldquo;password&rdquo; so you can use the MySQL
<tt  >PASSWORD()</tt> function to
parse it later in your PHP. I don't fully implement a password look-up
function in this app, but you can add that on your own to allow users
to log in securely.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29b9580.0x2aab760"></a>
Download the Application Files from GitHub</h2></div></div><p>
With the database and tables set, you can start using them to store
data. In order to do that, you'll need to make some calls to the Google
API and store the results in the database.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f5.large.jpg"><img src="12147f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Complete File List, Available in GitHub Repository
jtonello/booklist.
</p></div></div><p>
Move to the root of your Web server (<tt  >cd
/var/www/html</tt>), and use
<tt  >git</tt> to clone my booklist repository:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/jtonello/booklist
</pre>
</p><p>
This should create a folder with all the files in
/var/www/html/booklist. If not, move the contents to that path and
then change the ownership to www-data and give it permissions so you
can edit it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/booklist -R
$ sudo chmod 775 /var/www/html/booklist -R
</pre>
</p><p>
By changing the permissions to 775, you'll be able to edit the files as
you, not as sudo, since you added yourself to the www-data group earlier.
</p><p>
Take some time and look over the files, either on the GitHub page or in
your newly created directory. Each page includes documentation that I
won't repeat here, but here's some of the logic behind it all:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/includes &mdash; contains a common connection script (connect.php) and a
functions.php file that holds function code used on other pages. Edit
connect.php to add your MySQL credentials.
</p></li><li><p>
booklist.php &mdash; this is the API page, which features the book search
that connects to the Google book database. Edit this to add the Google
API key you set up earlier.
</p></li><li><p>
delete.php &mdash; this page executes queries to delete database entries.
</p></li><li><p>
index.php &mdash; the main page, which features tabs for Search, Read and
Wishlist.
</p></li><li><p>
login.php &mdash; the login form page.
</p></li><li><p>
saver.php &mdash; this page executes queries to save data to the MySQL
database.
</p></li><li><p>

How It Works</h2></div></div><p>
When users go to http://yourhost.com/booklist, they're greeted
by a login screen. When the form is submitted, the app checks
the value of the user name field against a static value saved in
/var/www/html/booklist/login.php. Later, you might attempt to make this
database-driven so more people can use it. This will get you started though.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12147f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The initial login screen determines the user.
</p></div></div><p>
Successful login takes the user to the main My Library view,
which includes three tabs generated by jQuery UI: Search, Read and
Wishlist. The Search page features the author and title search, and
the search results. The Read and Wishlist pages show previously saved
books. Search results appear on the Search tab through an AJAX function;
clicking the buttons in each book block will save the result in the
MySQL database and simultaneously change its color.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f7.large.jpg"><img src="12147f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. A simple search returns books from the Google database via
the Google API.
</p></div></div><p>
Once saved, these books now appear under the appropriate tabs: Read
or Wishlist.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12147f8.large.jpg"><img src="12147f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Previously saved items appear in the Read tab.
</p></div></div><p>
Each time a user clicks the Read and Wishlist buttons, behind the scenes,
two database queries are executed. One saves the book's ISBN, title,
author, description and other information to the MySQL table called books,
and one saves the ISBN, the user's ID, the Read or Wishlist flag,
and the date to the table called library.
</p><p>
The information stored in the books table could be limited to just the
ISBN, which could then be used to pull the title and other information
from the Google database, but doing it that way is slow and makes for an awkward user
experience. By saving key elements from the Google database locally,
you can see the key information for each book in fast-loading tabs.
</p><p>
The database tables are normalized, meaning the only overlapping data they
contain is the shared ISBN key. Queries that show Read or Wishlist books
perform a join to link the data in the separate tables together. That
also means that no matter how many users you have, you'll only ever
need to store a single copy of a book's details. You also can have
unlimited saved information for each user.

Make It Your Own</h2></div></div><p>
You now have a working application, created from the ground up. You've
installed a Linux distro from scratch, configured the firewall and
packages, and finally deployed the application. By building everything,
you've hopefully gotten a taste of how a full stack developer thinks&mdash;and works.
</p><p>
Of course, the My Library application is far from perfect and there's
plenty of opportunity for you to make it better. For example, you might
create a better login function that makes the tool usable to any number
of users. You also could change the page layouts by tweaking the CSS,
or you could improve how the contents of the Read and Wishlist tabs
load behind the scenes. Maybe you'll try to branch the app and make a
different version available in your own GitHub repository. The point is,
don't be afraid to experiment and make it your own.
