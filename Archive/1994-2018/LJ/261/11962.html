Confused by profiles and bashrc? Read on!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23ee358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I love Linux, and if you're reading this, chances are you do too. To be
honest though, 
some aspects of the Linux environment are confusing.
Near the top of the list for me is the profile system. Conceptually, it's
simple. There are system-wide settings that all users inherit, and then
there are individual settings people can set on their own. The problem comes
when different distributions handle profiles in different ways, and the
concept of login shells versus interactive shells comes into play. Usually,
it's not something Linux users worry about. But, when you need to make a
change, it can be extremely frustrating to figure out what is loaded in
what order, and which is seen by login shells only, and so on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23ee510"></a>
Login Shells</h2></div></div><p>
First, let me clarify what I mean by login shells. You've probably noticed
that sometimes in order to get to a terminal shell, you're prompted for a
user name and password. Other times, you just click on the terminal icon,
and you're presented with a terminal already logged in. You'll most often
experience this when using a GUI desktop environment. Basically, if you're
already logged in to your Linux desktop, and you open a terminal window,
it's an interactive shell.
</p><p>
It doesn't have to be inside a graphical desktop environment, however. If
you <tt  >ssh</tt> in to a remote server, you're prompted for a
user name and password
(thus, a login shell). If you then type <tt  >bash</tt> from inside that SSH
session, you're starting a brand-new terminal, but this time, it's an
interactive shell (notice you're not prompted for a password). Why it
matters is something I'll talk about a little later, but for comprehension
sake, just remember that if you're prompted for a user name and password, it's
most likely a login shell. If you go directly to a bash prompt, it's most
likely an interactive shell. The one fairly common exception to this is if
you've set up SSH keys to log in automatically. In that case, even though
you aren't prompted for a user name and password, it's still a login shell.
It's a pretty safe bet that if you're using SSH to log in, it's a login
shell.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23ee720"></a>
The Login Shell Process</h2></div></div><p>
The login shell process is far more complicated than interactive shells, so
I am going to go over that process first. I'm assuming your users have a
bash shell assigned in their /etc/passwd files. It's the most common shell
for users to have, so it makes sense to be familiar with its nuances.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 1:</em></span> when you authenticate in to a login shell, the system looks for a
file called /etc/profile. That file is a shell script that assigns a few
environment variables all users should have set. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 2:</em></span> the /etc/profile script usually ends by calling any shell scripts
in the /etc/profile.d folder and executing them as well. Often it will
run only shell scripts in /etc/profile.d that end with a .sh extension, so
look at the /etc/profile script to see how files should be formatted to
run properly. Having a folder to add custom scripts is important, because
if you have system-wide changes you'd like added to everyone's login shell,
adding commands to the /etc/profile file is dangerous. Any system updates
affecting /etc/profile will overwrite your changes. If you simply add a
custom file into the /etc/profile.d folder, it will be read by the updated
/etc/profile script even if it's updated.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 3:</em></span> the /etc/profile script also executes the user's personal profile.
This part is a little messy, as the user profile might be called different
things depending on distribution and/or user customization. In general, the
system will try loading the profile by name in this order:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
.bash_profile
</p></li><li><p>
.bash_login
</p></li><li><p>
.profile
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If it finds a file with that name in the user's home directory, it executes
it and stops. This means if you have a .bash_profile and .profile in your
home directory, only the .bash_profile will be executed. This is useful to
know if you want to customize your profile, but don't want to make changes
to the original user profile assigned to you. By default in Ubuntu, every
user has a .profile file, but not .bash_profile or .bash_login. So if you
want to customize your profile, simply copy the .profile in your home
directory to a file called .bash_profile, and make any changes you want to
.bash_profile. Doing that will leave your original .profile intact and still
will allow you to customize to your heart's content. Just remember, if you
create an empty .bash_profile, the system will see that as your profile of
choice and ignore your .profile file completely!
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 4:</em></span> finally, the last step along the login shell order of operations is
the .bashrc file stored in the user directory. This is another
script&mdash;this
one called from the .profile script in Step 3. Note that if you customize
your user profile settings, you'll want to make sure whatever profile file
you use actually calls the .bashrc script. It's inside the .bashrc script
where personal settings like a custom prompt and color settings go, along
with command aliases you might want to set (more on those later).
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 5:</em></span> this step doesn't really take place after Step
4; rather, it sort of 
branches off at Step 1. The /etc/profile script starts the process for
loading user profiles, but it also kicks off the process for executing the
system-wide bashrc file. Here again various distributions name this file
differently, but it's generally either a file called /etc/bashrc or
/etc/bash.bashrc. In the case of Ubuntu, it's /etc/bash.bashrc, but
historically, it's often /etc/bashrc. Note that unlike the user's .bashrc
file, the system-wide bashrc file does not start with a period.
</p><p>
To add insult to injury, some systems don't actually execute the system-wide bashrc file for login shells, so if you don't see it called in the
/etc/profile script, that means it's not going to execute for login
shells.
For the most part, however, the /etc/profile on the majority of
distributions does indeed call the system-wide bashrc file. Since you know
the order with which profiles are loaded, you can investigate on your own
system to see what is actually loaded during the login shell startup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23eef60"></a>
Interactive Shell Process</h2></div></div><p>
An interactive shell has a far simpler startup procedure. When a person
opens an interactive shell (one that doesn't authenticate a user name or
password), the following steps occur.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 1:</em></span> the /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc file is executed. This takes
place whether or not it's referenced in /etc/profile. While a login
shell automatically starts the /etc/profile script, an interactive shell
automatically starts the /etc/bashrc (or /etc/bash.bashrc) script.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Step 2:</em></span> the users' .bashrc from their home directory is executed. Again,
like the system-wide bashrc file, this isn't called from a user profile;
rather, it's executed directly by the interactive shell. So even if you've
erased the reference to .bashrc from the .profile script, an interactive
shell still will execute it.
</p><p>
And, that's it! An interactive shell doesn't look for any profile
information at all, either system-wide or in the user directory. However,
because an interactive shell is a &ldquo;child&rdquo; process of the login shell used to
log in initially (either via GUI or SSH), it inherits all the profile
information that initial login shell acquired. So although both the initial
login shell and the &ldquo;child&rdquo; interactive shell have the same profile
information loaded, the important distinction is that interactive shells
don't reload the profile information. They never look at the profile
scripts, so whatever information was loaded by that initial login script is
all they have access to. (This distinction will be more important when you
see what the scripts actually do.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23ef2d0"></a>
What Do Profiles Do?</h2></div></div><p>
First, a disclaimer: I can spell out only what is generally done with
profiles and bashrc scripts. It's certainly possible for a person to change
what is done by customizing either profiles or bashrc scripts. Generally,
it's good practice to stick to the standards.
</p><p>
Profiles mainly are used to load environment variables. Since profiles are
loaded by login shells, and login shells are the initial entry point into a
system, that's the time when setting up the environment makes the most
sense. One of the biggest environment variables is the PATH variable. When
a login shell is initiated, the PATH is set. Other
environment variables also can be set in the system-wide profile or
individual user profiles, but just know that the profile system is where
most variables are set.
</p><p>
The order with which profile information is loaded is very important,
because if you want to override the system-wide default profile
information, you can do so by specifying environment variables in your
personal user profile script. For instance, the PATH variable is usually
modified by the user's profile script on login. Usually, the .profile (or
.bash_profile, etc., see above) script will add ~/bin to the PATH variable
if users have their own bin folder inside their home directory. Because user
profiles are loaded after the system-wide profile, user settings take
precedent and override system-wide settings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23ef4e0"></a>
What Do RC Files Do?</h2></div></div><p>
Again, this is a generalization, but the system-wide bashrc file and then
the individual user's .bashrc script usually set personal preferences for
the command line. If you want a custom prompt, or prefer a specific color
scheme, the bashrc system is where that would be set. Much like
the profile system, the user's .bashrc file overrides the system-wide bashrc (or
bash.bashrc, again see above) settings. That means you can customize the
behavior of the command line however you like without affecting other users
on the system.
</p><p>
The most common customization inside the .bashrc file is to add aliases. An
alias is sort of like text expansion, in that it substitutes your defined
alias with whatever command you specify. For example, here's a snippet from
a .bashrc file in the user's folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'
</pre>
</p><p>
The aliases make it so that if the user types <tt  >ll</tt> on the command line, the
system will execute <tt  >ls -alF</tt> instead. It's a great way to make shortcuts
for commands with cryptic options or shortcuts for commands you type
often.
</p><p>
Although I'm not suggesting tomfoolery, .bashrc aliases are also a great way
to prank your fellow users if they leave their system logged in. Say you
create an alias like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ls='echo "Deleting all files..."'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23ef8a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then, every time they type <tt  >ls</tt>, they'll be in for a little (innocent) surprise!
Yes, it's very easy to do nefarious pranks with aliases, but since we all
log out when we leave our workstation, we shouldn't ever have to worry
about it, right?!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f6580.0x23efa08"></a>
Some Gotchas</h2></div></div><p>
Understanding how shells work really makes troubleshooting a lot easier.
You've probably already realized a few things, but they're
worth mentioning. If you make changes to any of the profile scripts, those
changes won't be recognized until you start a new login shell. The same is
true for .bashrc changes, but since you easily can close an interactive
shell and start a new one, .bashrc changes are easier to activate.
</p><p>
One of the main problems regarding profile loading is that if you make a
change to environment variable settings, like the PATH variable, you'll
actually have to log out and log back in to test your changes. You 
certainly can set a path variable on an interactive shell, but remember, any
new interactive shells will inherit the original login shell's profile
settings, so often logging out and back in is really the only way to
make permanent changes.
</p><p>
Also, although I went over it already, I want to reiterate that while the
system-wide profile (/etc/profile) and the user profile generally call the
bashrc scripts, they don't have to. If you make changes to your profile
settings, it's possible that your login shells will behave very differently
from your interactive shells. If that's your goal, great, but usually you
want to make sure your login shells also execute the bashrc stuff, since
that information is what makes the user experience more useful.
</p><p>
Finally, I want to add that the best way to understand and learn about profiles
and RC files is to play with your system. Learning how to manipulate your
settings is not only educational, but it can make your computing experience
much more convenient.
