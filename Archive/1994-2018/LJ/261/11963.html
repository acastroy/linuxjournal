I know you're expecting a sarcastic comment about an election year in the
US making it seem longer than normal, but no, 2016 is literally a longer
year than most. (Although that bit about it seeming even longer has some
merit.) What better way to start this bonus-sized year than with an issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>? I'm not a fan of resolutions, but I do have a challenge for
you: learn something new this year. Personally, I plan to learn more about
development. I dabbled in 2015, and it's given me the urge to learn more.
Reuven M. Lerner is the perfect author to join on a journey like that, and
this month, he teaches how to help improve client-side performance on your
Web applications. Sure, we could buy everyone faster computers, but Reuven
shows that there are better (and cheaper) ways to accomplish client-side
improvements.

Dave Taylor does some really cool calculations this issue and explains how
to determine your age on other planets programmatically. There's more to it
than that, but whether you plan to stay on Earth or migrate to Mars,
learning to calculate with the <tt  >date</tt> command will be a useful skill no
matter where you live. Speaking of time, Kyle Rankin gives a lesson in
how he spent many hours saving a few minutes. More specifically, he teaches
how to use the Debian preseed procedure to automate disk encryption and
partition creation. It sounds like something that wouldn't be too
complicated to automate, but Kyle found it was a messy rabbit hole. His
column should at least provide a flashlight if you decide to delve into
a similar hole.

I took a note from my own challenge this month and learned the exact way
Linux systems deal with profile and RC files. It seems like a trivial thing
to learn about, but it turns out that the procedures for loading profiles and
such are fairly complicated. I was tired of just copy/pasting information
into files without knowing exactly why some information goes into profiles
and some into RC files, so I decided to get to the bottom of how those
preference files are loaded. This month, I share the fruit of my labor and
hope to demystify the shell-based config files for everyone reading.

Encrypting filesystems and salting hashes are common ways to protect data
on a server. Quite honestly, we're beginning to see the value in encrypting
local data, and it's becoming common for servers to be secured more than
ever before. Unfortunately, most security breaches aren't happening on the
local machines; rather, they're happening over the network. It doesn't
matter how secure your local filesystem might be, if you're not
transmitting and receiving data in a secure way, no amount of local
encryption will protect your data. Charles Fisher not only exposes the
weaknesses with traditional file transfer methods, but he also explains how
to shore up network transfers when sending and receiving data. Whether
you consider your data sensitive or not, there's no reason to adopt
insecure methods in your environment. Charles shows how to make sure you
keep your private data private, even when you send it across the Internet.
</p><p>
Fabien Wernli also discusses security this month, but rather than securing
network transfers, he covers how to manage log files for console
connections. Keeping track of serial connections to the server console can
be challenging when your server number increases, but thanks to syslog-ng,
you're able to log that information. Fabien then goes on to describe the
process for consolidating log files into searchable archives and even
shows how to integrate console logs into a real-time monitoring
solution. If you manage a large number of servers via console or serial
(even over the LAN), you'll want to read his article.
</p><p>
Doc Searls finishes the issue by discussing the ramifications of ad
blocking on the modern Internet. If you browse the Web, chances are pretty
good that you use an ad blocker to make your experience more pleasant.
Blocking ads means blocking revenue for content creators, and rather than
pretending it's not an issue, we need to figure out how to respond in a way
that is useful both to consumers and content creators. As usual, Doc has
incredible insight, and you'll want to check it out.

This first issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in 2016 may be brand new, but it still
has all the tech tips, product reviews and helpful information you've come to
expect month after month. Whether the new year means ice and snow or
sunshine and roses in your part of the world, we hope this issue helps
start it off on a good note. We'll see you again next month, when February
grows an extra day and is almost a full-size month!
