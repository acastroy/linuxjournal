    We continually hear &ldquo;I would only use Linux except I need to
    ...&rdquo;. One of those missing pieces has been to run Quicken.
    Find out what programs are available for Linux
    that offer an alternative to Quicken.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x294b558"></a></h2></div></div><p>As Linux finds its way onto more and more
computers, the need for a broader range of applications increases.
One popular request is a Quicken-like program for managing
finances. There are several financial programs available for use on
Linux, and I present some of them in this article. The programs
covered are cbb, QHacc, GnuCash, Moneydance and gAcc.
</p><p>All of these programs can keep track of basic financial
information such as checking and savings accounts. Almost all of
them also offer some type of reporting and graphing functions. Most
of them can import files saved in the QIF format with varying
degrees of success.</p><p>Most of these programs are not up to version 1.0 yet, and
lack some features and polish. The authors are busy improving them
and adding functionality, so, while there is not an exact
replacement for Quicken or Money, you might find one of these
programs to be suitable for you.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x294b710"></a>cbb</h2></div></div><p>I installed cbb version 0.8.1 for this article. Written
entirely in Tcl/Tk and Perl, installation was accomplished by
simply typing <b  >make install</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> contains no compiled code, so
it should run on the majority of Linux systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> keeps account
information in individual files, one
<span   class="bold"><b>.cbb</b></span> file for each account. A list
of accounts and their current balances is displayed at the bottom
of the screen, and the account's entries are shown when you select
it (see Figure 1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4108f1.large.jpg"><img src="4108f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. cbb</p></div></div>
</p><p>Entering transactions in cbb is straightforward. The
transaction fields are between the ledger and the account list. You
enter the particulars of a transaction, such as date, amount and
category, then press <b  >ENTER</b> or click on the
&ldquo;Accept&rdquo; button to add it to the ledger.
<span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> allows you to easily change
the current check number via the &ldquo;+&rdquo; and &ldquo;-&rdquo; keys, and includes
a tab-completion feature for the payee and category fields.</p><p>Data entry is made simpler by the use of keyboard shortcuts,
the ability to tab through all the fields and the ability to accept
a transaction simply by pressing the <b  >ENTER</b> key.
If you enter a lot of transactions, you will find these features
very useful.</p><p>While you can use categories to group your transactions, cbb
does not allow you to specify whether a category is an expense or
an income, and you cannot create sub-categories. A workaround for
sub-categories is to use a naming convention such as Utilities,
Utilities-electric and Utilities-gas.
<span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> can display the category list
while editing transactions so that you can select the category you
want.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> offers the following
reports: transactions, transaction list by category, uncleared
transactions, missing checks, average monthly expenses by category
and transactions listed by payee. Graphs are available showing
running balances, movements by categories, expenses by categories,
expenses pie chart and categories by description pie chart. You can
specify beginning and ending dates for reports and graphs and
select the accounts to include.</p><p>Account reconciliation is accomplished by clicking on the
&ldquo;balance&rdquo; button. Before doing this, however, you must enter any
interest or service charges. When the balance window is displayed,
enter the beginning and ending balances from your bank statement
and start clearing transactions. If you notice a mistake, you can
fix it in the ledger without closing the reconciliation
window.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> allows you to import QIF
files, so that you are able to use your existing data.
Unfortunately, the import function did not work correctly on the
QIF file I created in Quicken 99. While I did get transactions,
there were no dates for them, and I could not edit them after I
imported them. There were also some lines at the beginning of my
ledger that contained data cbb apparently could not decode from the
QIF file.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cbb</b></span> is a good program for
keeping track of checking and savings accounts. It allows you to
enter transactions quickly and easily with the use of keyboard
shortcuts. The reports and graphs provide useful information, and
the ease of installation is a real bonus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x294c0b0"></a>Moneydance</h2></div></div><p>Moneydance is a shareware program written in Java. Of all the
programs reviewed here, it is the most Quicken-like in appearance
(see Figure 2), and it did the best job of importing my QIF files.
I used Moneydance 2.0.4.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4108f2.large.jpg"><img src="4108f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Moneydance</p></div></div>
</p><p>Installing Moneydance is very easy: simply unpack the tar
package and modify the Moneydance file so that it points to the
required .jar files. Then, place it where it can be found in your
path (e.g., /usr/local/bin) and you are ready to go. If you are
using an older Linux distribution, you might need to upgrade your
Java environment.</p><p>Each transaction in Moneydance must contain a source account
and a destination account. This is called double-entry accounting.
Each type of income (e.g., salary) and expense (e.g., mortgage,
fuel, credit card) appears on the chart of accounts, and all
transactions are really transfers between accounts. For example,
when you pay the electric bill, you transfer the money from your
checking account to your Utilities:Electric account.</p><p>Moneydance provides a useful auto-completion feature which
completes the payee name and displays the amount and accounts that
you previously entered for that payee. Navigation through the
ledger fields is easily done using the <b  >TAB</b> key.
When entering check numbers, you can either type the number or use
the mouse to select actions such as &ldquo;Next Check #&rdquo; or &ldquo;Print&rdquo;.
When you are done with the transaction, save it to the ledger by
pressing <b  >CTRL-R</b> or by clicking on the &ldquo;Record&rdquo;
button. If you have to enter many transactions, you might find it a
bit tedious to use the mouse for the check numbers plus two keys or
the mouse to record each transaction.</p><p>Account reconciliation is done by selecting &ldquo;Reconcile&rdquo;
from the Actions menu. You can add, edit and delete transactions
from the reconciliation window.</p><p>Moneydance provides both reports and graphs. There are
reports for transactions, account balances, income and expenses.
You can customize a report by selecting beginning and ending dates,
a specific account and the method of sub-totaling. Printed reports
look sharp and contain titles and date ranges across the top of the
page. You can graph the following information: Income, Expenses,
Income and Expenses, and Account Balances. I could not get the
graphs to print on my system for some reason.</p><p>You can print checks from Moneydance by selecting &ldquo;Print&rdquo;
for the check number, then selecting &ldquo;Print Checks&rdquo; from the
Actions menu. Moneydance supports standard checks and checks with
stubs and allows you to print test checks to calibrate your
system.</p><p>Another nice feature is the ability to search for
transactions. Selecting &ldquo;Find Transaction&rdquo; from the Actions menu
or pressing <b  >CTRL-F</b> brings up the Find window.
You can search for a specific Payee/Description, Memo or Check #.
Selecting &ldquo;Find Again&rdquo; or pressing <b  >CTRL-G</b>
allows you to find the next matching transaction.</p><p>If you are used to Quicken, you will find Moneydance very
easy to use. The only problems I found with it were minor ones. The
help file does not provide much information, but it does cover
basic account editing and double-entry accounting. On my machine,
Moneydance ran somewhat sluggishly, but I think this is due to the
fact that I am running an older version of Java on a slow
Pentium.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x294c7e8"></a>QHacc</h2></div></div><p>The next program is QHacc version 0.4.3. (Note: QHacc's
authors have released version 0.5, but too late for me to include
in this article.) This program requires the QT toolkit in order to
work, which I found to be quite an easy installation process. I
compiled the QT toolkit from sources and followed the instructions
for installing it, then I compiled and installed QHacc without
incident.</p><p>QHacc provides a simple two-paned layout. The left pane
contains a list of accounts and balances, and the right pane
contains the ledger for the selected account (see Figure 3).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4108f3.large.jpg"><img src="4108f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. QHacc</p></div></div>
</p><p>Transaction entry is a little different from the other
programs. Selecting &ldquo;new&rdquo; in the ledger brings up a transaction
window where you enter the check number, date, payee, amount and
memo. QHacc inserts the next available check number and provides an
auto-complete feature for the payee. The transaction is entered
into the ledger by pressing the <b  >ENTER</b> key, while
pressing the <b  >ESC</b> key cancels it. Withdrawals
must be preceded by a minus sign, because QHacc does not provide
separate credit and debit text boxes.</p><p>QHacc also provides a mechanism for memorizing transactions.
After entering the transaction that you want to memorize,
right-click on it in the ledger and select &ldquo;Memorize&rdquo; from the
pop-up menu. To insert a memorized transaction, right-click on an
empty ledger line, go to the memorized item in the pop-up menu and
select the transaction you wish to insert.</p><p>QHacc can be set up for single- or double-entry bookkeeping.
If you want to use categories for keeping track of your
transactions, you must use double-entry bookkeeping. You must also
use double-entry accounting to automatically update account
balances when transferring money between them, otherwise you have
to enter the transfer in both accounts. If you elect to use
double-entry bookkeeping, you can also split a transaction among
several accounts.</p><p>QHacc provides a simple graphing function that shows the net
total of transactions by the week. According to the companion TODO
document, more graphs will be added in the future.</p><p>Account reconciliation is the same as in the other programs.
Remember to enter any interest payments or service charges before
using it. Enter the starting and ending balances from your bank
statement, then select entries to clear.</p><p>At version 0.4.3, QHacc is the youngest of the programs at
which I looked. I did find one problem. If I entered 00 for the
year, it used 1900. Also, QHacc does not offer the ability to
import QIF files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x2d45068"></a>GnuCash</h2></div></div><p>GnuCash is the most ambitious financial program being
developed at this time. It offers the greatest variety of account
types, sub-accounts and stock price retrieval. This program was the
most difficult to compile and get working because it depends on
quite a few other programs, libraries and Perl modules. I looked at
both the stable version (1.2.5) and the current development version
(1.3.6).</p><p>Before attempting to use either of these versions, read the
documentation closely to determine which additional programs,
libraries and Perl modules you will require. Version 1.2.5 requires
Motif or LessTif and version 1.3.6 uses GNOME and the GTK. I had
better luck installing them on a Red Hat 6.1 system than I did on a
SuSE 6.1 system.</p><p>GnuCash offers a slightly different interface than the other
programs I tested. Its main window displays a list of accounts with
balances, and a new ledger window is opened for each account. This
allows you to view and edit more than one account at the same time
(see Figure 4).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4108f4.large.jpg"><img src="4108f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. GnuCash: Multi-Account View and
Edit</p></div></div>
</p><p>GnuCash offers more types of accounts than the other programs
(see Figure 5). An account can be identified as a bank account,
cash, asset, credit card, stock, liability, mutual fund, currency,
income, expense or equity. Accounts can be children of other
accounts, allowing you to create portfolios of funds. The ledger
windows change slightly depending upon the type of account you are
working with.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4108f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. GnuCash: Account Types</p></div></div>
</p><p>The ledger windows offer you the choice of displaying single
or multi-line entries and allowing you to sort transactions by
date, check number, transaction amount, memo or description.
Unfortunately, they do not remember your display selections after
you close them.</p><p>Keyboard entry leaves a bit to be desired in version 1.2.5.
While you can use the <b  >TAB</b> key to move through
the fields, in single-line mode you cannot tab over to the payment
or deposit fields because the focus jumps from the account field to
the &ldquo;Record&rdquo; button. Version 1.3.6 puts the command buttons above
the ledger, fixes the tab movement function and accepts a
transaction when you press the <b  >ENTER</b> key.
Neither version automatically increments check numbers in the
ledger window.</p><p>I had some problems importing my QIF file from Quicken 99.
GnuCash version 1.2.5 read my Quicken file and did a good job of
creating my chart of accounts, but all the ledger entries from the
QIF file had a date of 12/31/1969. Version 1.3.6 could not even
read my QIF file, quitting with the message &ldquo;wrong argument in
position 1&rdquo;.</p><p>GnuCash offers reports but no graphs at this time. The
reports included in version 1.2.5 are Balance Sheet, Profit and
Loss and Portfolio Valuation. Version 1.3.6 offers these reports
plus additional ones, such as a budget report, but there is no way
to create a budget from within GnuCash at this time.</p><p>While certainly the most ambitious program of the group,
GnuCash was also the most difficult to install. The documentation
does state which programs and libraries are required by GnuCash,
and I had better luck installing GnuCash on a Red Hat 6.1 system
than a SuSE 6.1 system. The dependence on so many external programs
and the difficulty of importing QIF files are the main problems
with GnuCash.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x2d45900"></a>gAcc</h2></div></div><p>The final program I looked at was gAcc version 0.7.1. gAcc
requires the GTK+ toolkit, version 1.2.2 or later, to be installed.
I found it relatively easy to compile the sources and install this
program, but I did have to copy a few files manually before it
would run.</p><p>gAcc's layout is similar to that of GnuCash, with a main
account list (see Figure 6) and separate ledger windows, but you
can work with only one account at a time. gAcc is from Europe and
offers better support for European dates and currency than the
other programs I tested. You can set these options from the
&ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; dialogs.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4108f6.large.jpg"><img src="4108f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. gAcc</p></div></div>
</p><p>Entering and editing transactions is not as user friendly in
gAcc as it is in the other programs. There is no keyboard shortcut
for adding new entries and no auto-complete feature for the payee.
Categories, actions and accounts are available from a drop-down
list so you do not have to remember them. One quirk with the
transaction entry is you have to delete the &ldquo;$&rdquo; in the amount
text box or $0 shows in the ledger, no matter what you
enter.</p><p>gAcc handles only checking and savings accounts. You can
create categories to keep track of your transactions. At this time,
it does not offer any reports or graphs, but these features are
listed in the TODO file to be added in later versions. There is
also no ability to import QIF files.</p><p>I originally tried version 0.7 and ran into a few problems
with the source tarfiles and the preferences dialog. I sent a note
to the authors and received a prompt reply from them. Shortly after
that, version 0.7.1 was released and the problems were fixed. This
was a very pleasant experience and a tribute to the authors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2853580.0x2d45d78"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I found cbb a very simple program to install and use, but it
is limited to simple finances. Moneydance is the most Quicken-like
in appearance and it also did the best job of reading my QIF files,
but it ran slowly on my system. QHacc offers the ability to work
with checking and savings accounts without much overhead. GnuCash
is the most difficult to install, but supports the greatest variety
of accounts. gAcc handles European dates and currency symbols
natively, but can also be set up for American symbols.</p><p>There is certainly no lack of financial programs available
for Linux at this time. If you have simple finances and do not mind
entering data by hand, one of these packages should work for you.
If your financial needs are complex or you want to move away from
an existing Quicken system, you have a more difficult choice. At
this time, there is no exact Linux replacement for Quicken, but I
am sure this is only temporary as these programs continue to mature
and improve.</p><p><a href="4108s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
