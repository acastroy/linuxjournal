Scrapings&rdquo; that listed a couple dozen domain names that were still
untaken. Since then, the domain name business has turned into an
e-land rush. At the current rate, several new domains are claimed
every second. That's a lot of &ldquo;brands&rdquo;, all bent on capturing
your eyeballs, or whatever it is that e-marketers are after these
days.</p><p>So we thought we'd step back into the fray to see just how
insane this business has become.</p><p>First, we took a look at some of the names we suggested
almost a year ago. &ldquo;Earwig.com&rdquo; is taken. So are
&ldquo;stoptalking.com&rdquo;, &ldquo;toygod.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;cashbird.com&rdquo;. But
&ldquo;coaptathetic.com&rdquo;, &ldquo;bedkill.com&rdquo;, &ldquo;buttcramp.com&rdquo;,
&ldquo;neithersex.com&rdquo;, &ldquo;petsurface.com&rdquo; and &ldquo;barfwash.com&rdquo; are all
still available. Hope lives.</p><p>In fact, hope abounds. Thanks to the good folks at
Register.com, we found many domain names already taken, like
&ldquo;feces.com&rdquo;, are blessedly unconfused by a host of derivative
names. So Register.com kindly lists a pile of those names, each
produced by adding an e-clich&eacute; prefix (e.g., &ldquo;about&rdquo;,
&ldquo;quick&rdquo; and &ldquo;cyber&rdquo;) or suffix (e.g., &ldquo;biz&rdquo;, &ldquo;search&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dot&rdquo;). So, if you're disappointed by missing your chance with
&ldquo;crap.com&rdquo;, you can choose from any or all of the
following:</p><p>aboutcrap.comcrapdot.comfreshcrap.comcrapmeat.comcrapforge.comcocrap.comcrapauction.comcrapexchange.comcrapbiz.comcrapbusiness.comcrapfirm.comcrapoffice.comcrapsearch.comeasycrap.comglobalcrap.cominteractivecrap.cominternationalcrap.comquickcrap.comsellcrap.comsmartcrap.comworkcrap.com</p><p>Sadly, mycrap, cybercrap, ecrap, quickcrap, crapstore,
crapsite and b2bcrap&mdash;all .coms&mdash;are taken.</p><p>But to prove there is still an abundance of untaken names,
here are just a few that remain unclaimed.</p><p>butthook.compalmhair.comhopeloss.comflyseason.comceleprosy.combuttsleeve.comworsestill.compalmnoogie.comdeerfillet.comstillstupid.orgweaselmeat.comisobozo.combobfromhell.comedgewrangler.comcoloncam.comspineshavings.comfrogdriver.combricktooth.comsmartweasel.comeyewax.com</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1255580.0x134dbe0"></a>NEOLOGISTICS</h2></div></div><p>A couple words from our resident linguist.</p><p>Tune in, turn on, click out.</p><p>What's the opposite of &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;?

noun &ldquo;information&rdquo;, which lately has been replaced with
&ldquo;content&rdquo;. Not that we've lost much. Both now carry the meaning
of cargo: something we aggregate, store, move, address and deliver.
Where we're moving, clearly, is away from real meaning.</p><p>Information, we noticed, derives from the verb
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inform</em></span>, which derives from the verb
<span   class="emphasis"><em>form</em></span>. In conversation, we don't just &ldquo;deliver
information&rdquo; back and forth. We form each other. When I learn
something new from you and what I learn is meaningful&mdash;that is, I
can't forget it&mdash;you have literally formed me. In other words, we
are authors of each other. What's more, we are in the market to be
formed. We demand it. Otherwise, we wouldn't learn a damn
thing.</p><p>That's why it's misleading to conceive of information as a
substance we &ldquo;deliver&rdquo; to each other (or worse, to an
&ldquo;audience&rdquo; of &ldquo;eyeballs&rdquo;). When we do that, we insult the verb
at information's heart.</p><p>So how can we start to recover some of the meaning lost when
information becomes content? I suggest abbreviating &ldquo;information&rdquo;
to &ldquo;of&rdquo;. When we're in the market for something meaningful, we
don't want content, or even information. We want the real deal,
pure and uncut. Give us of.</p><p>Okay, &ldquo;clicky&rdquo; has a better chance. But time will

Mandrake bounced back to increase its lead in Linux distribution
downloads from Tucows in May. Measured through May 25, Mandrake was
first with 40%, followed by Red Hat with 23%. That's a gain of 4%
for Mandrake and a drop of 7% for Red Hat. Next was Corel, which
dropped 2 to 10%. SuSE gained 2 and reached 5%. Slackware had 3%,
FreeBSD had 2 and so did Phat, which continued its drop from a high
of 13% in February. The rest were at 1% or less.</p><p>Now for an interesting statistical effect. Astute readers
will remember that last month, Red Hat took the lead, with 33% to
Mandrake's 31%. Like this month's May figures, April was then
tabulated through only the first 25 days. What a difference just
five days makes. In this month's report, we look at all 30 days of
April, and the difference pushes Red Hat down 3% and Mandrake up
5%. This leaves Red Hat in second place and Mandrake in first:
exactly the positions they've maintained since February. Tune in
next month to see if those last five days make any difference in
the final May numbers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4158d.large.jpg"><img src="4158d.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Smile, you're on a 1-pixel camera!
</p></div></div><p>Web pages use a publishing metaphor. They are pages, after
all. We write, open, read and bookmark them. That's one reason we
assume that when a page downloads from a server, it's a one-way
deal. The HTML describes the page, lays out the print, loads the
graphics onto the page and into the cache.</p><p>There is at least the presumption of privacy. After all,
reading is a personal (even an intimate) act. At times when
interaction is required, such as filling out a form, there's a
&ldquo;submit&rdquo; button that sends information back to the other end of
the line. We're still in control.</p><p>And okay, we know about cookies and what they do. If we're
especially vigilant, we either refuse to accept them, or we go
through the whole pile and weed out the suspicious ones.</p><p>But watch out. Big Brander is watching you. And not just with
cookies.</p><p>It turns out that some companies are spying on you and your
web travels by using invisible 1x1-pixel transparent GIFs. These
are in-line images downloaded from elsewhere, so the server-browser
dialog can initiate covert reconnaissance on you and your
subsequent surfage. You see no ad, and suspect nothing. The cookie
alert doesn't go off. But the bug&mdash;as in bugging device&mdash;has been
planted.</p><p>Who's doing the planting? Usually, a company that wants to
learn something about you. Most of the time it's an advertising
service that wants to &ldquo;target&rdquo; you with banners, e-mail spam or
whatever. But they can serve all kinds of purposes, known and
unknown. Don Marti found one on a Fed Ex page. (Presumably, they
want to track customers the way customers want to track a package.)
Richard Smith, the leading source of information on Web Bugs, found
two on Quicken's home page, both providing &ldquo;hit&rdquo; information to
advertising companies.</p><p>According to Smith's Web Bug FAQ
<a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfaq.htm" target="_self">www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfaq.htm</a>,
here is the information a Web Bug sends back to its server:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the IP address of the computer that fetched the Web
Bug</p></li><li><p>the URL of the page the Web Bug is located
on</p></li><li><p>the URL of the Web Bug image</p></li><li><p>the time the Web Bug was viewed</p></li><li><p>the type of browser that fetched the Web Bug
image</p></li><li><p>a previously set cookie value</p></li></ul></div><p>Of course, any graphic can serve the same purpose. That's why
the only way you can see a Web Bug is to view a page's HTML source.
But Smith also provides another way to at least discover what sites
are playing slight-of-pixel games: The Web Bug Search Page,
<a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfind.htm" target="_self">www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfind.htm</a>.
It shows where each of ten bugging companies are sneaking in their
little spies. Makes for interesting (and creepy) reading.
</p><p>On the matter of security, Don Marti gets the last word:
&ldquo;When a site tries to violate users' common-sense expectation of
privacy, it should be the system administrator's responsibility to
protect the user unless the user requests otherwise. Web ad banners
are a security hole.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1255580.0x134ecb8"></a>Uncollapsing Open Source Distinctions: a
Conversation with Craig Burton</h2></div></div><p>When he was at Novell in the 1980s, Craig Burton changed the
concept of networking by making Netware hardware-independent.
Later, at The Burton Group, he drove a new understanding of
networks&mdash;as services (file, print, directory, security,
management) rather than &ldquo;pipes &amp; protocols&rdquo;.</p><p>Lately, he has been turning his attentions to open source. He
consults for a number of open-source companies, plus companies
looking for open-source strategies. As always, his thinking is
highly unique, independent and not part of anybody's orthodoxy. We
caught up with him for a brief interview after he moderated a panel
in April at <span   class="emphasis"><em><i>Linux Journal</i>'s</em></span> &ldquo;Linux For
Suits&rdquo; event at Internet World. The interview moved forward by
e-mail in May and June.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: From what I gather, you
like open source, but not the way we talk about it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: I recognize open
source as a fact of business life that we need to get our heads
around, but we won't make much progress until we start pulling
apart a lot of distinctions that are currently collapsed. Until we
do, &ldquo;open source&rdquo; will just be a buzz phrase instead of a fully
rational strategy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You mean for
vendors?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: I mean for every
company that wants to operate in the world we're all trying to
build here. If you want to survive in the long run, you need an
open-source strategy. But you won't be able to implement one if you
collapse a bunch of highly discrete distinctions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Such as?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Accessibility and
ownership. These are very different sets of distinctions, and they
are entirely collapsed when most of us talk about them. The
opposite of open is closed, not proprietary. The opposite of
proprietary is public domain, not open.</p><p>Accessibility is an extremely important issue, and it is not
just about source code. There are questions of source, binaries,
licensing and derivative works. There are questions of protocols
and APIs. There are questions of cost. It is important to make
distinctions among the variables here. As an industry, we have
collapsed the issues of accessibility and ownership.</p><p>Here is a matrix that separates those issues but keeps them
in the same discussion by positioning them orthogonally. The
accessibility axis runs from Closed to Open, while the ownership
axis runs from Proprietary to Public Domain.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4158f.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Burtonian Matrix
</p></div></div><p>This is the matrix we need to understand, given any
technology. Microsoft has reluctantly participated in the
open-source corner of that matrix, and over time has moved a lot of
technology into the open/public domain quadrant. And a lot of stuff
they haven't. But the only significant difference between the Open
Source community's products and Microsoft's is the amount of core
technology that is made available in the open source half of that
matrix.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: So you don't believe
that because most of Microsoft's familiar software is closed
source, that it sucks?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: First, some of it
sucks and some of it doesn't. In spite of the open source movement,
customers are buying it and using it. Further, there are other
companies that have leveraged the Microsoft model to make money. On
the other hand, there is the constant threat to customers that
Microsoft will try to lock them in, and there is the constant
threat to Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) that Microsoft will
encroach on their businesses. Despite these threats, however, the
industry continues to grow and thrive. As a model for making
money&mdash;for lots of companies&mdash;we have seen nothing comparable yet
from the Open Source world.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>:
But we have seen a number of money-making models outlined by Eric
Raymond, first in &ldquo;The Magic Cauldron&rdquo; and then in the book
version of The Cathedral and the Bazaar.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Yet by Eric Raymond's
own description (in &ldquo;Homesteading the Noosphere&rdquo;), an
anti-commercial bias is part of the &ldquo;hacker ideology&rdquo; out of
which the Open Source movement has grown. That's one reason that
the distinction he makes between a cathedral and a bazaar is more
accurately one between a cathedral and a cult. A bazaar is, if
nothing else, a marketplace. And marketplaces are by definition
hospitable to business. So the culture of Open Source has a strong
steak of inhospitality to business. A lot of this comes from the
original Free Software movement and persists as a legacy in the GPL
license, which is in many ways the least open and business-friendly
of all the open-source licenses certified by Eric's organization,
the Open Source Initiative. The main reason I point this out is
that this anti-commercial bias accounts for the collapsing of
distinctions here, because this bias introduces a third axis&mdash;a
moral one that runs from bad to good. You can see it running from
the lower left to the upper right. Proprietary and Closed are Bad.
Open and Public Domain are Good. This is fine if all you want to do
is hack code. But if you want to do business, you've got to face
rational choices that are all over this matrix, whether you're a
supplier or a customer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Did I hear you say that
the GPL is really a moral statement?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Moral and political.
To me, the GPL is as much a political statement as a licensing
agreement. There's a bunch of stuff in there that's superfluous to
licensing concerns. This mixing political with licensing views is
what causes businesses to be suspicious of open source.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: But historically, the
Open Source movement has tried to move away from the Free Software
movement's anti-commercial rhetoric and policies.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Absolutely. The Open
Source movement has a tall order, in attempting to commercialize
the Free Software movement. We owe a lot to Eric Raymond for
attempting to make free software palatable to business&mdash;and
succeeding. Now it's clear that Open Source is a movement that will
eventually include everybody. But that doesn't mean all the code in
the world will be open source. Or public domain.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: The important thing,
then, is that both suppliers and customers need to factor open
source into their strategies.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Exactly. Every
business needs an open-source strategy. But the choices should
not&mdash;and will not&mdash;be made on moral grounds. There are many
combinations of choices that are all over this map. And you see
them when you look at some of the relatively proprietary and/or
closed products, or product components, being sold by card-carrying
members of the Open Source community.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Such as all three
desktop office suites for Linux. Applix, Sun and Corel all make
closed-source suites.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Exactly. And they're
all clones of Microsoft Office to a significant degree. But let's
stay with the core issue here. Software varies greatly in
accessibility, and open source isn't the only variable. In many
cases, you can get at the APIs but not the source code. That makes
the software somewhat more open than if the APIs and the source
were closed. Beyond the API, there is the case&mdash;as in the UDA for
Microsoft&mdash;where customers and competitors can add value to the
Microsoft model without having source.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Do you think Microsoft
has any understanding of this matrix, or uses it
strategically?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: In fact, Microsoft
has moved quite a few things to the upper-right quadrant of the
matrix. The Universal Data Access model provides a framework for
accessibility to core Windows constructs. UDA is not
open-source-based, but it provides programmatic interoperability
with the Windows architecture. While I think Microsoft could do a
lot more&mdash;including providing an open-source-based strategy to make
Windows accessible&mdash;it has made large strides to open up Windows,
and we shouldn't ignore that fact for the simple reason that
developers and customers have taken advantage of it. Many, many
companies have figured out how to make money off of Microsoft's
accessibility model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: But can Microsoft have
a truly strategic open-source strategy if it is hostile to
open-source software and the Open Source movement?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: No, it can't.
Microsoft's combativeness, its hostility to everything it perceives
as a threat, works against it here. But the same thing goes for the
combative folks in the Open Source community. Both sides fail to
understand the reasons for the other's successes. We have to get
past that, and a good way to start is by getting clear about what
some of these distinctions really mean. Without that clarity, we
see gray as black or white.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How, for
example?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Many Linux
distributions are chock full of stuff that's both closed and
proprietary. We just excuse it because it's bundled with something
that is called &ldquo;open&rdquo;. We see gray as white. Good guys wear white
hats and sell white code. But that's not always the case.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Give me an example of
closed source code that passes for open.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Security components
that use PKI&mdash;Public Key Infrastructure. We're talking about
copyrighted, patented stuff. Proprietary and closed as can
be.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: You mean RSA?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Right. The
distributions can't open source the RSA code. And it's all over the
place.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Let's go to the big
picture here. I watched you change the whole networking
conversation back in the '80s, from one about wires and protocols
to one about services. Are we at a similar cusp at this point in
time?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Yes. For some reason,
there's this idea that the Net is a finished thing. In fact, it's
only beginning. One of its virtues is that it's still wide open.
And it would help if more of us understood that openness&mdash;the
ability of infrastructural software to interoperate without
interference from anybody's agenda&mdash;is what enables growth. Over
time, as Microsoft is discovering, the challenge is moving
infrastructural code to the upper-right corner of this matrix.
There is a big movement right now to copyright and patent
everything you can name, but in the long run, that's wasted effort.
It's more rocks in the stream of progress. History will flow around
these obstacles. The real question companies need to ask is not
&ldquo;how do we patent and copyright and protect our stuff&rdquo; but &ldquo;how
do we make money and do business while we gradually move toward
that upper-right quadrant?&rdquo; To do that, you need to see the Net as
something that still desperately needs a lot of
infrastructure.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Such as?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: Directory and
security services, which go hand in hand, are still very primitive.
The Linux community is still using Sun's yellow pages (now called
NIS) for directory services. Within Linux itself, it's old UNIX
legacy stuff that hasn't changed in many years. Before we can have
real privacy, and real secure communication, and real useful
directory services&mdash;which we'll need to keep track of a world of
abundant, changing and distributed objects&mdash;we're going to have to
evolve past that legacy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Novell wants us to use
NDS. Microsoft wants us to use Active Directory.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: And neither will be
adopted by the Linux community, which is necessary for this whole
thing to move forward. They're both proprietary and in the way.
Rocks in the stream.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: How do you conceive the
Net? What's its conceptual architecture?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: I see the Net as a
world we might see as a bubble. A sphere. It's growing larger and
larger, and yet inside, every point in that sphere is visible to
every other one. That's the architecture of a sphere. Nothing
stands between any two points. That's its virtue: it's empty in the
middle. The distance between any two points is functionally zero,
and not just because they can see each other, but because nothing
interferes with operation between any two points. There's a word I
like for what's going on here: terraform. It's the verb for
creating a world. That's what we're making here: a new world. Now
the question is, what are we going to do to cause planetary
existence? How can we terraform this new world in a way that works
for the world and not just ourselves? Remember, this thing is in
outer space. It's not connected to anything else. If you want to
live here, you have to bring your own sustaining structures, foods
and the rest of it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Is this something like
what Larry Lessig calls &ldquo;end to end&rdquo; architecture?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: I haven't read much
of Lessig's work yet, but I believe we're consistent here. But
since we're talking about authors, I also like Carl Shapiro and Hal
Varian's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Information Rules</em></span>, which makes
pragmatic distinctions between the economy of building things and
the economy of building information. The old economy was driven by
economies of scale, including time, resources and materials. The
Open Source community claims this is outdated, and they're right.
But now what? These guys say that the economics of information
invite respect for network effects, which can be increased by
leveraging the value of intellectual property, rather than by
protecting that property. A key to understanding the economies of
networks is seeing that networks are comprised of relationships.
That favors companies that build and maintain relationships through
one of your favorite subjects: conversations.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Doc</b></span>: Who are going to be the
leaders in your view of the Web?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Craig</b></span>: I have six theses&mdash;as
opposed to ninety-five&mdash;that I use as the basis for determining the
leadership of the next-generation web companies:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No single vendor can own the web infrastructure.

all. We write, open, read and bookmark them. That's one reason why
we assume that when a page downloads from a server, it's a one-way
deal. The HTML describes the page, lays out the print, loads the
graphics onto the page and into the cache.</p><p>There is at least the presumption of privacy. After all,
reading is a personal (even an intimate) act. At times when
interaction is required, such as when we fill out a form, there's a
&ldquo;submit&rdquo; button that sends information back to the other end of
the line. We're still in control.</p><p>And okay, we know about cookies and what they do. If we
especially vigilant, we either refuse to accept them or go through
the whole pile and weed out the suspicious ones.</p><p>But watch out. Big Brander is watching you. And not just with
cookies.</p><p>It turns out that some companies are spying on you and your
Web travels by using invisible 1x1 pixel transparent GIFs. These
are in-line images downloaded from elsewhere, so the server-browser
dialog can initiate covert reconnaissance on you and your
subsequent surfage. You see no ad and suspect nothing. The cookie
alert doesn't go off. But the bug&mdash;as in bugging device-has been
planted.</p><p>Who's doing the planting? Usually a company that wants to
learn something about you. Most of the time it's an advertising
service that wants to &ldquo;target&rdquo; you with banners, e-mail spam or
whatever. But they can serve all kinds of purposes, known and
unknown. Don Marti found one on a Fed Ex page. (Presumably they
want to track customers the way customers want to track a package.)
Richard Smith, the leading source of information on Web Bugs, found
two on Quicken's home page, both to provide &ldquo;hit&rdquo; information to
advertising companies.</p><p>According to Smith's Web Bug FAQ
<a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfaq.htm" target="_self">www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfaq.htm</a>,
here is the information a Web Bug sends back to its server:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The IP address of the computer that fetched the Web
Bug</p></li><li><p>The URL of the page that the Web Bug is located
on</p></li><li><p>The URL of the Web Bug image</p></li><li><p>The time the Web Bug was viewed</p></li><li><p>The type of browser that fetched the Web Bug
image</p></li><li><p>A previously set cookie value</p></li></ol></div><p>Of course any graphic can serve the same purpose. That's why
the only way you can see a Web bug is to view a page's HTML source.
But Smith also provides another way to at least discover what sites
are playing slight-of-pixel games: The Web Bug Search Page
<a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfind.htm" target="_self">www.tiac.net/users/smiths/privacy/wbfind.htm</a>.
It shows where each of ten bugging companies are sneaking in their
little spies. Makes for interesting (and creepy) reading.
</p><p>On the matter of security, Don Marti gets the last word:
&ldquo;When a site tries to violate users' common-sense expectation of
privacy, it should be the system administrator's responsibility to
protect the user unless the user requests otherwise. Web ad banners
are a security hole.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1255580.0x165b4f0"></a><i  >LJ</i> INDEX&mdash;August 2000</h2></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Percentage of public relations professionals who

database is now officially in the Open Source world. The source
code has been released and so has a new company by the same name,
created for the purpose of serving the businesses that put
InterBase code to use.</p><p>The president of the new company is Ann Harrison, who
co-founded the original InterBase with Jim Starkey, the product's
original creator. Starkey also has a position with the new company
as &ldquo;technology software architectural advisor&rdquo;. This allows him
to work inside the Open Source development community that began
growing around InterBase even before the code was released.</p><p>Back in January, after Inprise (a.k.a. Borland) promised to
open source InterBase, <i  >Linux Journal</i>
interviewed Inprise CEO Dale Fuller on the subject. That interview
drew a record response from readers, most of whom expressed
enthusiasm for the move. Since then, interest in InterBase has
grown, while both Inprise and InterBase have gone through a number
of gyrations.</p><p>The intent to spin out a new company was announced in
February, around the time Inprise announced plans to merge with
Corel. Interest in InterBase grew, while the nascent company
labored to craft both a business plan and a licensing strategy. The
merger was called off in May, by which time free InterBase binaries
were being downloaded at the rate of 3,000 per week (that's more
than 50,000 as of late June).</p><p>By July, however, the new company was moving forward.
&ldquo;Basically, we're a start-up,&rdquo; Ann Harrison says. The company is
19% owned by Inprise/Borland's venture fund and expects to grow
quickly, along with the adoption curve of Linux in enterprise,
which is moving rapidly. &ldquo;Linux is a phenomenon much like the
Internet five years ago, and it's bringing up a lot of the same
kind of easy choices,&rdquo; Harrison says. &ldquo;People will say, `Why
should I bother fighting with the file system and trying to write
my own index code? Here's this free database. It just works. Why
don't I pick that up and use it?&rdquo;' Suddenly, it becomes the
default way of storing data.</p><p>The business model is to sell add-ons and services around the
product. These include training, support, documentation and
third-party packages such as an ODBC driver, a Java driver and a
product for connecting with development tools. The company does not
plan to do any development of its own, but instead serve and back
InterBase development and deployment, by both the development
community and enterprise customers.</p><p>Kylix will help. Kylix is the code name for Inprise/Borland's
family of visual development tools for Linux, due for release this
summer. &ldquo;We have a lot of tools that work well with Kylix, so when
it's released, that will give us another boost,&rdquo; Harrison
says.</p><p>The company's goal is not modest. &ldquo;Some day there will be a
popular spreadsheet for Linux desktops, with lots of users in the
enterprise. Where will that data live? On InterBase, we expect. Our
goal is not to own an organization, but rather to own all the
organization's applications, from the standpoint of the data
store.&rdquo;</p><p>While InterBase never scored big as a commercial product, it
did develop a loyal following over the years starting in 1984, when
the company was founded on an idea Jim Starkey had in the shower,
and initial capitalization of $243.50. After early success with
selling to the UNIX workstation market, the company was sold to
Ashton-Tate, which was sold to Borland, which became Inprise (now
Inprise/Borland, or vice versa&mdash;it's hard to keep the old name
down). Restarting the same company with two of the founders is an
interesting second-chance story.</p><p>InterBase does face competition in the category. PostgreSQL
has been open source for many years, and also has a loyal
following. And the incumbent relational databases are certainly not
going to go away easily.</p><p>But Linux is being adopted quite easily by countless
enterprises. If InterBase can surf that wave, it should do pretty
well.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div></div>
