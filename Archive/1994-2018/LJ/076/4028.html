Solutions: heavy-hitting performance, lightweight price.
</p><p>Or, if not lightweight, at least inexpensive, compared to
their mainstream competition. ImageStream's backbone routers spring
from a simple premise: take GNU/Linux, with all of its proven
networking abilities, and package it in an industrial-strength
wrapper. Simple premise, perhaps, but far from a simple
accomplishment. Fortunately, ImageStream has had plenty of
practice. Founded in 1993, they have been building Linux-based
servers and routers long enough to know what is important.</p><p>Packing support for a wide range of physical interfaces, up
to T3 and beyond, and enough expansion room to cram over twenty
T1s, multiple Ethernet and a couple of big WAN connections in a
fully loaded system, ImageStream has taken their simple premise and
made it into a useful reality. Dynamic routing with RIP1, RIP2,
OSPF and BGP4, bandwidth management, firewall support and seamless
interconnectivity with Cisco and other major name routers make the
accomplishment even more impressive. A price point well below
Cisco's makes their reality compelling.</p><p>In order to build their routers, ImageStream first created a
Linux distribution: one that maximizes network functionality while
minimizing hard-disk space requirements so it fits nicely on a
solid-state flash hard disk and has easy-to-use administration
tools. You don't need to be a Linux guru to set up or maintain the
system. Then, they developed and released, under the GNU GPL, an
open-source Linux kernel extension called SAND, Standard
Architecture for Network Drivers, which allows binary distribution
of WAN hardware and protocol drivers. SAND is a compromise between
the open-source ideal of always having open source, and the closed
binary-only drivers that have caused so much trouble in the
computer industry. It is a necessary compromise for routers,
because many WAN drivers need to contain code or protocols licensed
from companies that don't support open source.</p><p>The most significant feature of SAND is its ability to mix
and match binary protocol, WAN card and even external CSU/DSU
drivers from different manufacturers. This means a protocol
developer can release a driver and have it work with any WAN card
that uses SAND drivers, and a WAN card producer can release a
driver to support its hardware knowing the various protocols will
be supported. SAND also provides a standard method for configuring
and monitoring varied WAN interfaces, simplifying performance and
bandwidth monitoring across multiple interface types.</p><p>ImageStream's compact and network-heavy Linux distribution,
when married to an industrial-quality rack-mount PC, becomes a
high-power router fully capable of meeting the backbone routing
requirements of ISPs, schools, businesses and anyone who's ever
considered the benefits of a private T3 Internet connection to
their home. Despite their PC heritage, these routers give a first
impression far removed from the usual desktop-PC chintz.</p><p>I looked at two of ImageStream's routers, the Gateway and the
Rebel. The main difference is in the physical size and level of
expansion. The Gateway has twelve available PCI slots for WAN or
LAN cards; the Rebel has four. Which router is right for a
particular network application will depend more on current need and
projected expansion than on differences in core functionality.
Though it was not tested, parts of this review also apply to the
ImageStream Enterprise router, the biggest of the line with 18 card
slots.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcad580.0xda5c38"></a>The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>Both of the routers tested are based on a single-board
computer with integrated 100MB Ethernet. Additional network
interfaces are added using PCI WAN and LAN cards, which plug into a
passive backplane. Interfaces range from V.35 ports to HSSI and
ATM, and can be pre-installed or user-added. The chassis are
standard industrial 2U and 4U rack-mount PC cases and are available
with dual hot-swappable power supplies for an additional $500 US.
Adding interface cards to the Rebel requires removing fifteen
screws, which must be a record. A far more reasonable four screws
grant access to the Gateway. In either case, once opened, access is
excellent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcad580.0xda5d40"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Included with the ImageStream router is a slender manual made
up of a quick-start guide, a configuration guide and an appendix
(the largest part of the manual) filled with handy information,
such as cable-wiring diagrams, subnet-mask tables and
troubleshooting information. At first glance, the manual seems
downright sparse, and a second glance will confirm that impression.
However, the manual does one thing beautifully&mdash;it tells you what
you need to know. It assumes you know how to mount the chassis in
your rack and which end of the cord plugs in the wall. It tells you
how to access most of the unique features of the router and how to
fix the things that are likely to go wrong. It is hard to complain
about that, but compulsive manual collectors will be frustrated by
how unimpressive the ImageStream manual looks next to a stack of
Cisco books. The most noticeable hole was in the instructions for
configuring dynamic routing&mdash;there were none. If you intend to use
BGP, RIP or OSPF, a book on configuring GateD or a visit to
<a href="http://www.gated.org" target="_self">http://www.gated.org/</a>
will be essential.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcad580.0xda5ea0"></a>Setting Up</h2></div></div><p>Configuration can be done in one of three ways. By connecting
a standard VGA monitor and PC (AT or PS/2) keyboard, you can treat
the router just like the Linux PC it actually is and watch the BIOS
POST, see kernel messages during boot and even switch virtual
consoles. If you have a monitor and keyboard lying around, this is
definitely the way to go; if you don't, you can log in using
TELNET, <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> or an RS-232 terminal.
Without a monitor, you can't watch the system boot messages, so if
something is wrong with the hardware or kernel, you'll have a
harder time fixing it.</p><p>A simple text-mode menu system provides the primary user
interface. From the menu, you can view the system status, edit the
configuration files, back up and restore the configuration, change
passwords, access a <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> shell and
do most routine maintenance tasks. The menu options represent only
a subset of the abilities of the router, but a useful subset. If
you want to do anything fancy, including most troubleshooting, you
will need to leave the menu.</p><p>Both routers have bandwidth-limiting and firewall
capabilities. Configuring bandwidth limiting will require a brief
trip outside the configuration menu; the process is
well-documented. You can edit the firewall configuration file
directly from the menu, but there is no documentation explaining
why or how you would do so.</p><p>Most routers use one of three basic configuration schemes:
interactive command-line interfaces, form or template interfaces
and configuration files. There is no best way&mdash;each has its own
strengths and weaknesses, and most people prefer whatever they've
worked with the most.</p><p>Conventional Linux network configuration is an example of an
interactive command-line interface; commands like
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span> change the state of the
kernel networking subsystem while it runs. With Linux, the commands
must be executed each time the system boots in order to set up the
network. Router manufacturers often take things a step further by
using commands to set up the active state of the router, then
directly saving a snapshot of the active configuration into flash
so that when the router reboots, the commands do not need to be
re-run. Interactive command interfaces can be disconcerting if you
don't plan properly or are a slow typist. Changes go into effect as
you enter them, so complex configuration changes can leave the
router non-functional while you enter your new configuration line
by line. Mistakes and typos are usually easier to track down,
though, since the error is usually in the last line you entered,
and you will immediately see any error messages.</p><p>Template interfaces are most often used when only a limited
number of possible configurations exist. They are usually the
easiest to set up, but if the interface designer didn't anticipate
your needs, you can be left hanging.</p><p>ImageStream departs from the Linux norm by using a
configuration file for the LAN and WAN interfaces, which goes
beyond the startup scripts common to all Linux distributions. A
single configuration file contains information on all physical and
logical interfaces, including both interface-specific parameters
and IP configuration. The router, after a brief sanity check to
make sure you didn't tell it to do anything too silly, puts the
configuration into effect. The advantage is that you can spend as
much time as you like modifying the configuration and activate it
in just a couple of keystrokes&mdash;or not, if you chicken out. The
ImageStream routers end up with a mix of interactive command-line
and configuration-file interfaces, because the standard Linux
networking tools and some of the ImageStream-specific features,
such as bandwidth limiting, are still command-driven.</p><p>The file format ImageStream uses to set up the network
interfaces is unique but very easy to follow and well-documented.
Each interface has its own subsection with information such as IP
address, netmask, static routing information, baud rate and
port-type specific parameters, and the file provides a logical
framework for maintaining the interface configurations. Each
interface type has its own quirks and limitations, although
ImageStream has standardized the configuration format and does its
best to hide the differences, making configuration of WAN
interfaces easier. A SAND reference guide, also part of the manual,
provides all information you need to set up each interface
type.</p><p>Other than setting up the WAN interfaces, configuring the
routers is just like configuring any other Linux box with similar
features. Dynamic routing is handled by GateD, which has its own
set of configuration files. Setting up GateD is fairly easy, and
complete instructions and sample configuration files can be found
at the GateD web site.</p><p>If, once everything is up and running, you expect to make
only infrequent, major changes to the router configuration, files
win hands down; they provide a complete view of the changes you are
making, and they minimize down time. Unfortunately, each time a
file is changed, there is a chance that a typo or minor error will
take down <span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> until you find and
correct the problem. Interactive-command interfaces shine when you
are working with large, complex setups that need frequent minor
changes, e.g., routers with numerous frame-relay permanent virtual
circuits. The effect of configuration changes is usually more
local, reconfiguring only one circuit or feature, and likewise,
typos and bad configurations have a more local effect.</p><p>The solid-state hard disk imparts some quirks to the system
and will seem a bit strange at first. The system boots from the
&ldquo;hard disk&rdquo; (which is actually a 40MB SanDisk flash ROM device)
but loads the active files into a 16MB RAM disk and runs from
there. This imposes limitations similar to systems that boot from a
CD-ROM drive: you can make changes to the system, create files,
etc., but your changes are temporary. A menu option allows you to
save all of your changes after you have verified they actually
work. This means bad configuration changes can be undone by
rebooting. It also guarantees that, unless you reboot while saving
the configuration, the system will never corrupt its file system
due to an improper shutdown. But, it can catch those unaware and
cause frustrating, too-late realizations that &ldquo;now was not the
time&rdquo; to reboot. The frustration of helplessly watching the router
boot up with no memory of the elaborate configuration you just
spent the last hour working on can be acute.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcad580.0xda64d0"></a>Operation, Maintenance and
Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><p>Testing the operation of a high-end router without having a
high-end use for it can be a serious challenge. Fortunately,
ImageStream was kind enough to provide a pair of routers so I could
get a feel for setting up high-speed circuits. In all of my
testing, I was never able to heavily load either router noticeably.
In fact, both routers took everything I could throw at them and
didn't blink once.</p><p>Regular configuration file backups will be easy for people
with physical access to the routers. The menu-based backup option
will use the floppy drive only to save or restore. An administrator
could perform his own network backups, of course, but an option to
generate an archive file and store it using FTP would be nice. If
you do not expect to do a lot of reconfiguring, you won't need to
do a lot of backups, and the biggest maintenance hassle will be
keeping the air filters clean&mdash;a hassle I could live with quite
easily.</p><p>Tracking down problems when something does go wrong may be a
bit of a headache. You will need to exit the menu in order to
diagnose all but the simplest problems, but unlike mainstream
routers, knowledge of Linux networking will actually help. The
system and network interface status can be read and viewed using
standard commands such as <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>uptime</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> and exploring the /proc
file system, but some of the most important information is
unavailable. For example, you can read the current active route
tables using the <span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span> command,
but the router cannot tell you where the routes came from. Tracking
down a BGP or OSPF configuration problem is going to be like
dancing blindfolded&mdash;possible, but best done without an audience.
ImageStream includes 24/7 tech support with their routers, so
you'll always have a dance partner available and that should be a
real help. The latest release of GateD includes new routing status
monitoring tools, and when ImageStream updates their system later
this year, the diagnostic capabilities will take a quantum leap
forward. As it is, the limited diagnostic information available is
the worst feature of these routers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcad580.0xda67e8"></a>And, in the End...</h2></div></div><p>The Gateway and Rebel routers, as tested, performed every
task set before them flawlessly. While there is room for
improvement, especially in the area of feature documentation and
diagnostic information, their functionality and features cannot be
denied. If you know Linux and are looking for a high-end backbone
router, the ImageStream routers should be on your list&mdash;or in your
rack.</p><p><a href="4028s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
