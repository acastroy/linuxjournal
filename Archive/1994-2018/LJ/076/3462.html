    A look inside RPM packages and how to use Java to extract

time is quite straightforward. You can find good and cheap Linux
packages on the market that will quickly install themselves. You
need only choose some configuration options describing the type of
hardware on which you want to install, and that's it.
</p><p>As time goes on, you will add some new components to your
Linux system, and that's where the nightmare may begin. A Linux
system is composed of hundreds of components and dynamic libraries.
In order to keep your system up and running, you should be careful,
since installing a new version of a component may introduce
incompatibilities in your system, making it more unstable as time
goes on.</p><p>Replacing an existing component with a new version at first
looks like a trivial task: you just need to pick up a new compiled
version of the component, generally available on the Net in a .tgz
file (tar + gzip compression), and install it on your system. Some
dynamic libraries of the component you just upgraded may already be
used by other installed components and might not be compatible with
the new version you just installed.</p><p>It would be great to have a tool which could report the
dependencies of each component installed on your system. Such a
tool could tell you the version of Samba (for instance) installed
on your system or that you can't install egcs-1.0.2-8 on your
system prior to having binutils 2.9 up and running. This tool
already exists on Linux&mdash;it is called RPM&mdash;and is on many existing
Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Caldera, SuSE and Linux
Mandrake.</p><p>RPM stands for Red Hat Package Manager and is described by
its creator as &ldquo;an open packaging system available for anyone to
use and works on Red Hat Linux as well as other Linux and UNIX
systems&rdquo; (from the Red Hat installation guide).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1419580.0x1511920"></a>A Quick RPM Tour</h2></div></div><p>Before starting the programming discussion, I will introduce
the RPM package manager and give a general overview of it. If you
need more information, see Resources for more than 400 pages of
interesting details on RPM's history, design, usage and
programming.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3462f1.large.jpg"><img src="3462f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. RPM Tool Components</p></div></div>
</p><p>The diagram in Figure 1 represents the different components
involved in the RPM tool. RPM is composed of three main
parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a database</p></li><li><p>candidate packages</p></li><li><p>RPM utilities, which modify the database and
packages</p></li></ul></div><p>The RPM database, located in /var/lib/rpm on Red Hat
distributions, is owned by root; it is a mirror of all the packages
which are presently installed on your system. The RPM utility
accepts various commands which query the database for installed
packages, install or update the system with new RPM packages,
remove unused packages from the system, and verify and check
installed package dependencies. Usually, when a new version of a
given component becomes available on the Net, you have two choices:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Look for a tar gzip file containing the sources.
Compile the sources on your system, then proceed with installation
of the binaries. The given package generally provides a README, a
make and make install procedure to help you.</p></li><li><p>Look for a tar, gzip file containing the binaries,
meaning that someone else has already compiled the sources for you
on the same kind of computer as yours. Then proceed with
installation of the binaries.</p></li></ol></div>

The only way to check that everything went well is to try to
execute the binaries. If something goes wrong, finding the reasons
why may cause a lot of frustration and wasted time. With RPM, the
process is quite different.
</p><p>Let's say you are interested in installing version 1.9.18 of
Samba. First, you should look on the Net for an RPM of the Samba
package (instead of a tar, gzip package). Once you have it,
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -uvh samba-1.9.18p8-50.1.i386.rpm
</pre><p>This command will install (or upgrade) a copy of Samba on
your system. It will also check that all dependencies needed by
this version of Samba are present on your system. If the
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> command completes with no
error messages, you're guaranteed the installed package will be
ready to run without trouble at the end of the installation
process.
</p><p>This installation process will also update the RPM database
which keeps track of all installed packages on your system and all
their dependencies.</p><p>So if, six months later, you want to find out which version
of Samba is installed on your system, typing the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q samba
</pre><p>will tell you
<pre     class="programlisting">
samba-1.9.18p8-50.1
</pre>


If you want to remove a package from your system, the RPM utilities
will remove the files which were installed on your system during
installation.

available on the Net today and having a portable tool able to
analyze an RPM package before installing it could be an interesting
utility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1419580.0x1512528"></a>The Choice of Language</h2></div></div><p>I think there are only two possibilities if you want to be
portable to multiple UNIX and non-UNIX systems and easy to use in
the Internet context: Perl or Java. From a technical point of view,
there is no reason to prefer one over the other. The choice is a
personal decision.</p><p>I have more experience programming Java than Perl. After a
long and difficult thought process, I decided to start in Java,
reasoning that if I later needed to add graphical presentation
classes to the component, I could use the Java Swing package (which
is available with JDK1.1 or JDK 1.2).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1419580.0x1512688"></a>Where to Start</h2></div></div><p>If you look at the /usr/lib directory of a Red Hat
distribution, you will find a librpm.a static archive library. This
library is provided with its corresponding C language prototypes:
rpmlib.h, header.h and dbindex.h, located in
/usr/include/rpm.</p><p>You can use those prototypes if you need to develop C
utilities which deal with RPM resources. Chapter 21 of E. C.
Bailey's book (see Resources) provides detailed information on how
to do this. But, since we want to provide an independent Java
package, these prototypes are of no interest to us.</p><p>The right place to start from (in the same resource) is
Appendix A: Format of the RPM file, which gives us the RPM File
format. The same appendix also provides us with the following sage
advice: &ldquo;RPM file format is subject to change.&rdquo;</p><p>If an RPM file format is to be manipulated, you are strongly
urged to use RPM routines to access the package file. Why? &ldquo;RPM
file format is subject to change&rdquo;!</p><p>In our case, we will assume there is no immediate danger in
querying an existing RPM package, since we commit to never
modifying its structure inside our Java package.</p><p>very confusing. Please make sure a pair of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>technical</em></span> eyes looks it over to make sure it
sounds OK. Dave Wright's changes were incorporated. -Ellen</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1419580.0x15129a0"></a>The RPM Class Design</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3462f2.large.jpg"><img src="3462f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Structure of the Java RPM Classes Design
in UML Format</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 2 represents the structure of the Java RPM class
designs in UML format (Unified Modeling Language). Let's explain it
in more detail. The UML class design provides a clean high-level
representation of what an RPM package is.</p><p>Content is interesting information on the package and its
installation rules. The content itself (not represented in the UML
picture, for clarity) is only a compressed archive. When
uncompressed, it is a cpio archive in SVR4 format with a CRC
checksum (see Resources).</p><p>I cleanly separate the RPM object from its graphical
representation. The classes in Figure 2 implement only operations
on RPM files; they don't provide any graphical representation of
them. Another class, called <b  >RpmFilePanel</b>, will
be added to provide a simple Swing display, which will graphically
manipulate the basic RpmFile class, designed to implement the
behavior of an RPM file.</p><p>The first interesting class is the
<b  >RpmException</b> class. This class inherits from the
basic Java Exception class and implements a default constructor
with no parameters and a constructor which takes a String message
parameter. This class is the only exception rendered by the RpmFile
Java Package. I am convinced that, when writing a new Java package,
the first thing you should do is build an exception wrapper for the
package. Later on, all the classes of the RpmFile package will
throw an <b  >RpmException</b> with an accurate message
when something goes wrong. From an object-oriented design point of
view, this technique improves your design's robustness, providing
your package with full isolation from the basic system layer. You
can, of course, do the same thing in C++. The only problem is that
support for exceptions by some C++ compiler implementations may not
be available, and portability of your C++ code could be more
difficult to implement.</p><p>The next public Java class is the <b  >RpmFile</b>
class itself. The public methods made available by the
<b  >RpmFile</b> class implement the following basic
services (The constructor gives the ability to build a class
instance. It does not take any parameters.):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >set_rpmFileName (fileName)</b>
method: this takes a URL fileName string as its parameter. This
method binds the RpmFile instance with an URL representing a valid
RPM package to view. If a problem occurs during the bind, a
RpmFileException is thrown.</p></li><li><p>Vector <b  >get_rpmReport()</b> method:
once the Rpm package has been bound to the RpmFile instance, this
method can be called to get the package information. The
information given back by this method uses a String vector which
contains all the information found in the RPM package header
structures.</p></li></ul></div><p>The RpmFile logic is based on following two inner classes:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >_RPM_LEAD_</b>: internally
instantiated by the <b  >RpmFile</b> class to validate
the RPM lead structure of the loaded RPM URL file.</p></li><li><p>Once the <b  >_RPM_LEAD_</b> has been
validated, the <b  >RpmFile</b> class instantiates an
<b  >_RPM_STRUCTURE_HEADER_</b> class, which is used to
check the RPM file header content. The header content consists of
multiple <b  >_RPM_INDEX_ENTRY_</b> stored in an internal
array. Each element of this array represents a piece of header
information which will be made available later via the
<span   class="bold"><b>get_rpmReport</b></span> method. Since there
is no reason to make those classes visible to mere mortals outside
the RpmFile, they have been implemented as internal Java Classes
inside the <b  >RpmFile</b> class. A more precise UML
graph is provided in Figure 3. I used the JVision 1.2 tool to
automatically generate the UML class diagram from the Java source
code. JVision is a very interesting, easy-to-use tool from Object
Insight
(<a href="http://www.object-insight.com" target="_self">http://www.object-insight.com/</a>).
This tool is able to automatically generate UML diagrams from Java
source classes. Although not free, the license price is reasonable
compared to other products. I have been using it for more than one
year now, and it helps me in producing Java project documentation.
A Linux beta version (free for non-commercial use) of the product
is available on the Object Insight web site.</p></li></ul></div>

headers of RPM packages, is in place, and it would be a good idea
to add a minimal GUI interface to it. We will build this very
simple interface using the Java Swing package, available with
either JDK 1.1 or JDK 1.2.</p><p>This very simple GUI interface is managed by the
<b  >RpmFilePanel.Java</b> class. This class inherits the
basic JPanel graphical component and divides the screen into three
parts using a Java BorderLayout:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>URL input field to input the RPM input file
location in URL format</p></li><li><p>scrollable ListBox to display the RPM file
information</p></li><li><p>button bar containing a &ldquo;load&rdquo; button, which
proceeds with the URL RPM file loading Let's now explain how the
GUI interface <b  >RpmFilePanel</b> Java class interacts
with the <b  >RpmFile</b> class.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1419580.0x150a728"></a>Starting the Java Application</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >RpmFilePanel.java</b> file contains a
static <span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span> method to launch the
Swing frame inside a Java application. You can use the JDK Java
utility from the shell to start it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
java rpm.RpmFilePanel
</pre><p>Warning: you should have compiled the Java package and
installed it in a location accessible from your
<b  >CLASSPATH</b>.
</p><p>You should provide a valid RPM package file in URL form and
type it into the URL field as shown below. Finally, pushing on the
Load button will:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>instantiate a new <b  >RpmFile</b>
instance</p></li><li><p>call the
<span   class="bold"><b>set_rpmFileName</b></span> method with the
RPM of URL field</p></li><li><p>call the
<span   class="bold"><b>get_rpmReport</b></span> method and display
its String Vector result into the Swing List box as shown
below</p></li></ul></div><p>Figure 4 shows the screen layout after querying an RPM
package.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3462f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. RPM Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p>When you need to build the provided source package, you may
use either a JDK 1.1 version or a JDK 1.2.2 version. If you use
JDK1.1, the prerequisite is to download the Swing package from
Sun's site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1419580.0x150b070"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Using Java to analyse RPM file formats may be useful, and it
gives you cross-platform portability, which may help you display
RPM file contents on heterogeneous platforms. This basic tool may
easily be enhanced, for instance to convert RPM contents into other
formats or extract other parts of an RPM package.</p><p><a href="3462s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
