web applications is crucial in today's fast-changing,
browser-centric world. Rapidly changing business demands drive the
need for rapid web site content updates/changes. Competing artistic
factors supply a constant challenge to keep the web site's visual
design interesting. Seldom does one individual possess all the
talents required to meet each of these challenges. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Open
Source Linux: Web Programming</em></span> addresses these types of
challenges.</p><p>In this book, the reader is guided through an extensible and
scalable web application development methodology. The tools used to
carry out the methodology include Perl, CGI, HTML and XML. The
recommended methodology is based on object-oriented and decoupled
functionality concepts. By the time you reach the book's end, you
will have developed and examined a series of web applications that
apply each design concept or programming convention.</p><p>The authors assume the reader possesses at least an
intermediate level of experience with computing and programming
technologies. With this framework, the book states the concept to
be applied or the task to be performed. The rationale for why each
concept or task is important is also presented. What you will not
find is a list of the steps required to perform the tasks.
Extending what you learn to your own applications is where the
intermediate to advanced experience comes in. What's presented will
generally get you up and running. Other resources are required if
you want more specific details.</p><p>The book is divided into two sections, &ldquo;The Modern Internet
Application&rdquo; and &ldquo;Going Beyond Today's Internet Model&rdquo;. The
first section (and majority of the book) is devoted to programming
an Internet application. Each chapter opens with a few paragraphs
on what you are going to build and why the way it will be built is
important. Systems or functionality programmed in one chapter is
often the foundation for systems or additional functionality
presented in later chapters. For those who dislike typing, all
program listings are available on the CD-ROM.</p><p>The first section opens with a quick review of distributed
systems and an introduction to the Apache HTTP server. In the
chapter titled &ldquo;Using Perl to Implement CGI on Linux&rdquo;, the
authors present just enough Perl for the reader to understand the
forthcoming application programs. A simple Perl-based CGI module
that analyzes Apache logs is programmed in this section.</p><p>The &ldquo;Separating Content and Logic with Objects&rdquo; chapter
further explores a modular and dynamic web site design. Decomposing
application content, program and business logic and presentation
into objects are discussed. Techniques presented facilitate coding
an easily maintained site-wide look and feel. Here, &ldquo;easily
maintained&rdquo; means a non-programmer can update content and change
graphics. These designs and techniques result in coding a simple
on-line catalog application.</p><p>The next three chapters focus on using XML. &ldquo;Using HTML to
Create Well-Structured Objects&rdquo; walks one through basic XML syntax
and structure. Writing XML-driven CGI scripts that translate XML to
HTML is the focus of the &ldquo;Handling XML with a CGI Application
Server&rdquo; chapter. The discussion on XML continues in &ldquo;Creating a
Client-Based Web Content Administrator&rdquo;. This chapter concludes
with the coding of a Perl, CGI, HTML and XML web content
administrator application. This application enables a non-technical
person to update web page content. All the concepts and coding
techniques presented in these chapters may be put to use
today.</p><p>In the book's second section, the authors pause to look a
short distance into the future. They then close the book out with
two very critical subjects. This section's opening chapter
discusses limitations and issues related to the stateless
transaction nature of HTTP and CGI. The authors offer a rationale
for moving to a state-based transaction and an open-source XML
application server.</p><p>Chapter 9, &ldquo;Developing Java Applets on Linux&rdquo;, presents
Java basics through the construction of simple Java applets.
Chapter 10, &ldquo;Creating a Java/XML Web Application&rdquo;, pulls together
previously presented design principles and techniques to code a
network chat and whiteboard application.</p><p>The last two chapters cover error handling and web deployment
applications. Poor error handling can easily destroy the user's
experience. Poor site deployment can ruin the user's experience and
negatively impact the application's post-implementation performance
and maintainability. An error-handling system is constructed in the
&ldquo;Bulletproofing Your Site with Error Handling&rdquo; chapter. As in the
previous projects, the authors begin by applying object-oriented
concepts to the error-handling system. In this example, they
decouple error messages from the error codes. Both objects are
decoupled from the error handler and the actions to be taken upon
an error situation. Nothing stresses an application, or its
implementation, more than a real user. Next to the user, nothing
can cripple a web site faster than coding techniques incompatible
with the implementation strategy.</p><p>The chapter entitled &ldquo;Deploying Your Linux Web Application&rdquo;
reviews how implementation decisions can reach back and negate
application development and coding decisions. This chapter briefly
discusses the need to consider various factors affecting
throughput, scalability, system resource consumption and the need
to avoid vendor-specific language extensions. General guidelines
for identifying bottleneck and bandwidth problems are
suggested.</p><p>By the time you reach the end of this book, you will have
explored conceptual constructs, models and tools you can use to
develop web sites. These sites should be easier to deploy, update
and maintain. More importantly, web site content changes will not
always require programming expertise to implement.</p></div></div>
