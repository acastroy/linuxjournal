    I have files I don't even recognize.

into the wine cellar, please. While you are down there, give the
&ldquo;Dom&rdquo; a quarter turn as well. Oh, and bring up the '78
<span   class="emphasis"><em>La Tache</em></span> when you come back up. After all this
re-arranging and straightening up, I think I will need to relax a
bit.
</p><p>Mon Dieu! Mes amis, I had not realized you were here. Forgive
me and forgive this mess. With all the work that has been going on
around here, I had not noticed it was opening time. Please, sit
down. I will call down to Fran&ccedil;ois and have him bring
something special from the cellar. On the house!</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! We have guests. A case of Dom Perignon for
our friends!</p><p>You know, mes amis, when we cook with Linux, we can get a
little carried away. After many experiments in the kitchen of your
processor, your <b  >$HOME</b> can become quite the mess,
non? I have files I don't even recognize. And yet, I am afraid to
delete them. What if they are important? What if I need
them?</p><p>One solution is to move. Moving a user to a new directory is
child's play with Linux. For instance, if I had a user called
&ldquo;natika&rdquo; with a home directory of /home/natika, and I somehow
felt that Natika would be better served in a new directory called
/home/boullabaise, I would issue a command like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# usermod -d /home/boullabaise -m natika
</pre><p>The &ldquo;-d&rdquo; specifies the new directory, while the &ldquo;-m&rdquo;
tells <span   class="bold"><b>usermod</b></span> to move everything
from /home/natika to /home/boullabaise for the userid &ldquo;natika&rdquo;.
If the directory does not already exist, it will be created. The
problem is that everything is moved, and any clutter you may have
had will follow you to your new <b  >$HOME</b>.
</p><p>Speaking of clutter ... were you ever curious about the vast
array of .jpg files you've scattered across your system? Finding
them in order to better organize them can be done with the
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# find / -name "*.jpg" -print
</pre><p>Do you want to time that command, mes amis? Depending on the
power of your system, this can take awhile and you are likely to
get a lot of &ldquo;permission denied&rdquo; messages (particularly as you
traverse <b  >/proc</b>) or when running as a
non-privileged user. Luckily, there is a faster way. On most Linux
systems, you have a process that runs once a day. That process
builds a database of all the files on your system for quick and
easy searching. The command is called
<span   class="bold"><b>locate</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>slocate</b></span>. The process that runs on
your system is located in /etc/cron.daily and called
<span   class="bold"><b>slocate.cron</b></span>. If your system is
not up 24 hours (it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a Linux system, non?),
you can build the slocate database by running the cron script
manually, or with the command
<span   class="bold"><b>updatedb</b></span>. Let us try to find those
.jpg files again.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# slocate jpg
</pre>


Amazing, is it not? I should tell you that the find command is
quite a bit more powerful than slocate, but if you need to lay your
hands on a file quickly and you have no idea where it has gone, try
slocate. However, if what you are trying to do is locate old files
or particularly large files, then you should definitely use the
find command. Here's an example where I look for anything I have
not modified (the <b  >-mtime</b> parameter) or accessed
(the <b  >-atime</b> parameter) in the last twelve
months.
<pre     class="programlisting">
# find /data1/Marcel -size +1024 \
\( -mtime +365 -o -atime +365 \) -ls
</pre>


The backslashes are escape characters, there to make sure our shell
does not interpret them in ways we do not want it to, in this case,
the open and close parentheses on the second line. The first line
also has a backslash at the end. This is to indicate a line break,
as the whole command will not fit neatly on one line of this page.
Were you to type it exactly as shown without any backslashes, it
would not work; however, the backslashes in line two are essential.
Ah, but there is something else I have not told you. The above
command also searches for files that are greater than 500KB in
size. That is what the &ldquo;-size +1024&rdquo;, means, since the &ldquo;1024&rdquo;
refers to 512-byte blocks. The <b  >-ls</b> at the end of
the command tells the system to do a &ldquo;long&rdquo; listing of any files
it finds that fit my search criteria. You may want to pipe this
output to your printer in order to better examine the results.
Another option is to redirect it to a file, which you can later
peruse and decide on what course of action to take.
</p><p>Earlier, I mentioned that I'm afraid to delete any of these
files because I don't always know what they are. While your humble
chef may have been exaggerating a tiny bit, I can tell you how you
can improve that search to help you uncover the secrets behind
those files. Your system contains a command called
<span   class="bold"><b>file</b></span> which can deliver useful
information on files and what they are. If I modify the find
command by adding a <b  >-exec</b> clause, I can yield
even more information.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# find /data1/Marcel -size +1024  \
\( -mtime +365 -o -atime +365 \) -ls -exec file {} \;
</pre><p>The open and close braces that follow <b  >-exec
file</b> means that the list of files generated should be
passed to whatever command follows the <b  >-exec</b>
option. The backslash followed by a semicolon at the end is
required in this case.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> is a wonderful command
in other ways. For instance, I can use it to look for
<span   class="bold"><b>SUID</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>GUID</b></span> files, which is extremely
useful for security reasons. It is simply a good idea to check your
system for files that are set to execute as root and decide whether
they should be there or not. I also use find to locate core files
and editor temp files, those strange little files with the tilde
(~) at the end of the file name. And, of course, working so much in
the Linux kitchen means I have source files for hundreds of
applications I have tried and tested for you, mes amis. Have a look
at the following sample script which I have written to take all
these ideas into consideration.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
#
# Locate files and report to me.
# Marcel Gagn&eacute;, 2000
# search_log=/tmp/foundfiles
rm -f $search_log

echo "Looking SUID / GUID files . . . " &gt;&gt; $search_log

"Looking for core files or old editor files . . . " &gt;&gt; $search_log echo

#
echo "------------------------------- " &gt;&gt; $search_log
echo "All done!" &gt;&gt; $search_log
</pre><p>Of course, my <b  >$HOME</b> (or my whole system,
for that matter) is not the only place that needs organization.
There are so many things to keep track of these days that Chef
Marcel needs additional, Linux-style help. How about some
electronic sticky notes? You already have 40 or 50 covering your
monitor, cubicle wall or desktop (the wooden one, as opposed to the
virtual one on your monitor). Why not transport the concept to your
Linux desktop? KDE comes with a little program called
<span   class="bold"><b>knotes</b></span>. You can find it under the
Utilities menu, or just type <b  >knotes</b> from a
terminal window. Unlike your classic paper sticky, you can also set
alarms with these notes and they do not use up paper.
</p><p>Yellow sticky notes are fine and quite frankly, I have found
them to be extremely useful on a number of occasions.
Unfortunately, they do not offer the flexibility of a planner or
calendar. Once again, with your Linux system, you are ready and
able to better start planning your life. If you are running GNOME,
you can use the program <span   class="bold"><b>gnomecal</b></span>
to keep yourself organized. KDE users have
<span   class="bold"><b>korganizer</b></span> to keep them focused.
We focus a great deal on both KDE and GNOME users, since desktop
applications tend to be designed with ease of use in mind. However,
GNOME and KDE are not the only alternatives, and many people use
lighter, faster desktops. (For this article, I have been using
Window Maker as my window manager.) To those looking for a nice
cross-desktop alternative, I recommend
<span   class="bold"><b>ical</b></span>, a clean, simple X window
calendar program.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4162f1.large.jpg"><img src="4162f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The ical Program
</p></div></div><p>While not the most powerful calendaring software, ical stands
on par with gnomecal mentioned earlier. This little program is
likely already installed, and almost definitely on your CD-ROM
distribution disk. Start the program by typing
<b  >ical</b>. The initial screen is a month-view
calendar, a to-do list and a single-page day planner view. You can
also share calendars with other members of your office by clicking
on &ldquo;File&rdquo; and &ldquo;Include calendar&rdquo;.</p><p>Some time ago, your humble chef admitted he needed even more
help than ical alone (or electronic yellow stickies, for that
matter) could provide. He needed something portable, something that
followed him everywhere. That help comes in the shape of his Palm
Pilot. While the friendly folks at 3Com were good enough to create
this little wonder, they did not provide Linux software for backups
and hot-syncs. Luckily, the Linux community of talented developers
have come through to help your humble restauranteur stay organized
as well as backed up.</p><p>Each and every tool I mention from here on requires the
<span   class="bold"><b>pilot-link</b></span> suite of utilities. You
should not have to go hunting for this package, since it is likely
already installed on your system. If not, check your distribution
CD. One sure way to find out is to try the command
<span   class="bold"><b>read-ical</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>read-ical</b></span> is an interface program
that will read your Palm Pilot information and load it into a
calendar file that can be used by ical. Here's the format for the
command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
read-ical /dev/pilot calendar_filename
</pre><p>In the case of my system, <b  >/dev/pilot</b> is a
symbolic link to <b  >/dev/ttyS0</b>. I created that link
with this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pilot
</pre>


After issuing the read-ical command, you should click on the
&ldquo;hot-sync&rdquo; button on your Palm Pilot's cradle. Be warned, mes
amis. This process is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a true hot-sync.
Each time you execute this command, the calendar file name you
specified above is overwritten. For this reason, you should use a
different file than your normal everyday calendar file (or your
company-wide file). I used a file I called pilotcal. To use it with
ical, I simply clicked &ldquo;File&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Include Calendar&rdquo;. I
specified the file named &ldquo;pilotcal&rdquo;, and suddenly, all my
appointments and to-do items were available.
</p><p>Before I move on to what I think of as &ldquo;Super Stickies&rdquo;, I
should mention that the KDE Korganizer program also allows you the
means of sync'ing with your Palm, as does another cool KDE program
called Kpilot. I have used Kpilot for quite some time now, but
lately I've discovered another player in this field, something
called J-Pilot. This one won't be on your CD, so you will have to
visit the web site (see Resources). Looking very much like its
inspiration, the Palm desktop software distributed for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that other OS</em></span>, J-Pilot mimics what is already
a familiar interface for users of the Palm Pilot. Written by Judd
Montgomery, J-Pilot is available as a source tarball or an RPM (Red
Hat, Caldera, Slackware 7).</p><p>But what about combining the venerable yellow sticky with the
flexibility of the Palm Pilot? Is there nowhere to turn? Luckily,
Michael J. Hammel (of Graphics Muse fame and a frequent contributor
to this magazine) has written XNotesPlus. This is a nifty little
package that extends the power of the sticky well beyond that
afforded by knotes.</p><p>You can pick up the source, a GTK version or a Motif/LessTif
version from the Graphics Muse web site. I picked up the GTK
version, which at the time of this writing was version 3.2.2.
Installation of XNotesPlus is a breeze. After untarring and
unzipping the distribution, simply run the install script from the
distribution directory. The steps are as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf XNotesPlus-v3.2.2-Linux-gtk.tar.gz
cd xnotes
./install
</pre><p>The script will confirm with you the location of your xnotes
database, as well as the path name to the executable. You will also
get instructions to add the following lines to your .bash_profile
so that you can sync with your Palm Pilot.
<pre     class="programlisting">
export PILOTPORT=/dev/pilot
export PILOTRATE=57600
</pre>


To use XNotesPlus, issue the command <b  >xnotes+</b>.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4162f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Setting an Alarm with XNotesPlus
</p></div></div>

</p><p>C'est vrai. There is a plus sign at the end of that command.
The application appears with a nice little Window Maker-like icon
which you right-click to do various things (it has a little swirl
that looks sort of like a galaxy). Among the features you'll find
(other than covering your virtual desktop in yellow) is a Palm
Pilot sync utility, the ability to print envelopes from your
address book, set alarms with little musical reminders, e-mail
notes, or, if you really don't want to clutter your desktop, you
can even hide the notes.</p><p>Before I leave XNotesPlus, I should point out that while it
is free software and source is provided, it is not GPL'ed. Read the
accompanying &ldquo;COPYING&rdquo; file for license details.</p><p>Well, mes amis, it is that time once again, when we must
part. Next time you visit, I hope to be a little more organized.
While it is good for you to sip free champagne, it is not so good
for me, non? Never mind; enjoy. In fact, have Fran&ccedil;ois pour
you a final glass before we close the door. When next we meet, your
table will be ready here at Chez Marcel.</p><p>A v&ocirc;tre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="4162s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
