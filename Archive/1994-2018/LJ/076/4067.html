Macintosh guy. I got a Macintosh late in my computing career, just
last year in fact&mdash;an iMac. I was working on a cross-platform
Tcl/Tk project, and I was getting pretty involved in fine-tuning
the GUI for Mac OS, Windows and Linux. I decided it was too much to
rely on feedback from the users, so I opted to buy a cheap Mac on
which to test the application. I ended up with one of the Revision
B iMacs, which is a decent machine, and my wife likes it too.
</p><p>Well, wouldn't you know it: I soon discovered that folks were
running Linux on these things, so I just <span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span>
to try that out. Linux on a Mac has now come of age, with about
half-dozen vendors offering distributions for PowerPC
processors.</p><p>Yellow Dog Linux is one of these vendors, and they offer a
number of packages targeted at different levels of usage. Champion
Server is just like the name sounds: a package targeted for server
applications, but it also works well as an individual workstation.
Yellow Dog also has a Gone Home edition in the works, originally
targeted for home users, but now their vision has changed and
Yellow Dog says Gone Home will be &ldquo;a revolution in the way Linux
is installed and experienced&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2273870"></a>The Package</h2></div></div><p>Yellow Dog Linux put much thought into the packaging of their
product, offering anything from plain CDs to binders to a full
nylon zippered notebook sporting the Yellow Dog &ldquo;Labrador&rdquo; logo.
The package <i  >Linux Journal</i> gave me to evaluate
was the zippered notebook (see Figure 1), which also included some
Yellow Dog bumper stickers to help you show the world you're an
avid Yellow Dog fan. Both bound versions have the CDs in plastic
jackets in the notebook and a nicely done manual. If you opt to go
the download route, YDL offers image files of the install CDs on
their web site and mirrors. (Do yourself a favor, though, and buy a
CD, or go in with a group to buy a set and burn your own copies.
It's not that much money ($24.95 US), and you won't be consuming
the bandwidth for that 700MB download.) There are three CDs total:
the &ldquo;Install&rdquo;, &ldquo;Source&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Tasty Morsels&rdquo; CD. Tasty
Morsels contains additional games and applications, including some
that do not fall under the GNU license. It also contains KDE2 and
the Linux 2.3.49 source tree. Interesting to me was
<span   class="bold"><b>pcb</b></span>, a basic printed circuit-board
layout program, because I am a printed circuit-board
designer.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4067f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2273be0"></a>Installing Yellow Dog Linux</h2></div></div><p>Champion Server, like many distributions these days, is based
on Red Hat Linux, using RPMs and the text-based Red Hat installer.
To begin the install, insert the install CD in your CD drive with
the power off, then power up the system holding down the &ldquo;C&rdquo; key,
and you will be presented with a <b  >yaboot</b> prompt.
<span   class="bold"><b>yaboot</b></span> is a boot loader along the
lines of the familiar LILO on x86 machines. At the prompt, type
<b  >install</b> and soon you will see the ever-present
Tux and the Red Hat text-mode installer. There is no mouse at this
point, so use the arrow keys, <b  >TAB</b> and space bar
to select and acknowledge the prompts. You are asked to select a
language and keyboard type, which defaulted to English and
mac-us-std, respectively, for me. You are then prompted for the
installation media (CD-ROM for me).</p><p>The iMac uses USB (universal serial bus) for all its
peripherals, including the keyboard, so the first thing you need to
do is identify the keyboard and language so you'll be able to use
the keyboard during the install. I had a problem with this&mdash;my
keyboard worked at the yaboot level, but not in the Red Hat
installer. After some trial and error, I found that putting my
Belkin Hub on the USB chain was the root of the problem, and my
keyboard worked after removing the hub. (USB is still a little
shaky, in my opinion. Half the time, my mouse does not work in Mac
OS until I unplug/replug it in.)</p><p>The first thing you must do is set up your partition table.
The installer takes you into this step, offering to use either
<span   class="bold"><b>disk-druid</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>pdisk</b></span>. I believe pdisk is the only
true option for a Mac OS-partitioned drive, so this is your best
bet. <span   class="bold"><b>pdisk</b></span> is much like
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> for Intel Linux, a
text-based program where you use letter commands to create and name
your partitions of various types. I opted to create a single Linux
partition of about 1.4GB and a 20MB swap partition, because I had
another working Champion Server setup that I wasn't ready to
sacrifice just yet. In many cases, it's a good idea to create
separate partitions for /, /var, /usr and /home. If you want to
upgrade later, you can then opt to leave /home alone and reformat
the other partitions and still retain your personal files and
settings. It's important to remember to reboot after setting up and
writing the partition table to ensure the changes take effect. I've
seen a number of people encounter problems (not just with Champion
Server) when they did not reboot. The install appears to go fine,
although very quickly; yet upon booting, they find many things
missing or not functioning properly. (It would be nice if the
installer gave you a graceful way to reboot, rather than having to
press <b  >CRTL-OPT-POWER</b>. It would also be nice if,
after the reboot, the installer could resume where it left off.)
One thing I should mention is that the prompts show fdisk, but you
are actually using pdisk. If you have already set up Linux
partitions, as I did, you can skip the reboot.</p><p>I should also mention most Linux vendors recommend you do a
clean install, not an upgrade to your existing install. If you have
a separate /home partition where you keep your personal files, they
will be kept during the install, provided you don't format that
partition. Many people have a lot of problems trying to upgrade a
Linux system. The safe bet is to make a full backup and start
clean, then pull the things you need from your backup. You may find
you don't miss much from your old installation.</p><p>The installer gives you a default set of packages to install
that is fairly complete, and you can fine-tune this by category and
individual package. If you attempt to install a package that
depends on another, the installer will warn you and offer to
install the necessary packages. I hand-picked what I installed,
giving myself enough to get a feel for what the distribution had to
offer, but omitting some pieces due to my limited partition
size.</p><p>The installer takes a few minutes to install the packages,
then detects your mouse, letting you fine-tune the selection, and
then offers to set up networking. I have a network setup at home
with my primary box running Linux serving as a server/Internet
gateway for the rest of the network. I assigned a fixed IP address
to the iMac, the same as used in Mac OS, and set up the main box as
the gateway, with DNS addresses for my ISP. The installer then asks
you to choose your time zone, which it also correctly detected as
US/Eastern for me. You are also given a list of
d&aelig;mons/processes to start automatically at boot, and you can
enable or disable them as you see fit. (These are programs such as
Apache, Sendmail and NFS.)</p><p>Next, you are asked if you would like to configure printing.
Again, my printers are all networked and power-controlled by X10
controllers from the server. I opted to pass print jobs through
this queue.</p><p>You have the opportunity at this point of setting the root
password and choosing whether to use shadow passwords. You are then
instructed on which partition you should enter in BootX, and the
installer goes on to identify your video card.</p><p>The proper X server is configured. A message tells you to
start X on your new system using
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span>, and if you have problems,
to run <span   class="bold"><b>Xconfigurator</b></span>.</p><p>You are then congratulated on your install, and the system
reboots.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x22743c8"></a>Running Yellow Dog Linux</h2></div></div><p>Running Linux on a Macintosh is a little different than with
Intel. On the Intel side, most folks use LILO. On the Mac, the boot
loader of choice used to be BootX, but now yaboot is also
available.</p><p>BootX runs under MacOS and can be set up as an extension, so
like LILO, you are offered the choice of booting MacOS or Linux.
Unlike LILO, you are already well into the MacOS boot-up GUI before
you get the opportunity to choose Linux, although you do have a
nifty graphical screen, allowing you to enter some options that
control the boot process (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4067f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. BootX Screen
</p></div></div><p>yaboot works at a lower level, more like LILO, giving you a
boot prompt at power-up. The Champion Server documentation steps
you through the setup for both of these programs, with special
notes as to options for the various Mac hardware platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2274738"></a>The Documentation</h2></div></div><p>While I'm on the subject of documentation, let me take a
moment to comment on the Yellow Dog manual. Although only a
loose-leaf three-hole package, it is very well done with clear
instructions covering the full install. As mentioned above, it also
lists special considerations for the various Mac/PPC hardware
platforms. They also have a FAQ area on their web site (see Figure
4) and the usual mailing lists, monitored by YDL staff. Questions
are answered fairly quickly.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4067f4.large.jpg"><img src="4067f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. YDL Web Site</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2274a50"></a>Booting YDL for the First Time</h2></div></div><p>I started using Linux on the PPC with another distribution,
and had considerable trouble getting basic things like the
keyboard, video and mouse, which I had taken for granted on Intel,
to work. Setting up X can sometimes be a true challenge on the PPC,
and since the Mac has no text mode, you can end up in a situation
where you don't even have a visible command prompt. YDL wisely
opted to boot the system in run level 3 with only the command
prompt, so you can set up and test your X configuration before
committing to booting straight into X with run level 5.</p><p>I already had a BootX setup from my old install and chose to
keep it. Older iMacs have an ATI Mach64 video card, and Yellow Dog
recommends adding the stanza
<b  >video=atyfb:vmode:17</b> to your kernel arguments
and unchecking the &ldquo;No Video Driver&rdquo; option. I also have a
non-standard iProRaidTV SCSI card/TV tuner installed in the
mezzanine slot of my Revision B iMac, so I have an additional
<b  >ncr53c8xx=safe:y</b> option to force the card to
wait for the SCSI bus to settle during the boot process. This also
disables some of the advanced features of the card, but it does
work&mdash;usually.</p><p>For BootX, take a copy of the Linux kernel (vmlinux&mdash;PPC does
not use compressed kernel images) and put it in your system folder
or the kernel folder under your BootX install. I generally use the
system folder along with the BootX extension, so I can go right
into Linux early in the Mac OS boot process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x2274cb8"></a>In the Dog House</h2></div></div><p>I ran the BootX program, checked my kernel parameters and
pressed the &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; button. The Mac OS screen changed to a black
screen with the ever-present Tux in the upper-right-hand corner,
and I observed the normal stream of boot messages identifying and
configuring my hardware&mdash;until it hit the iProRaid card. At this
point, I ended up in a somewhat familiar endless loop of SCSI
resets and was forced to power down the machine to get out. YDL
apparently uses the sym53c8xx SCSI driver in their stock kernel,
and it did not recognize my &ldquo;safe&rdquo; kernel parameter. (Both of
these drivers are very similar, as I believe Symbios bought the old
NCR chipset technology. The NCR/Symbios cards are very popular and
inexpensive; I've got three of them in various Intel machines.) I
tried replacing <b  >ncr</b> with <b  >sym</b>
in my kernel arguments, as well as <b  >sym53c875=0</b>,
but nothing seemed to stop that endless SCSI bus reset.</p><p>But all was not lost. I've got my own home-compiled 2.2.14
kernel with the NCR driver, as well as modules for the video
portion of the card, so I used it instead, and soon I was up and
running, looking at the root login prompt. Although an annoyance
for me, I do realize my machine is non-standard, and if it weren't
for the iProRaid card, I would have been up and running much
sooner. What would be nice is being offered both a monolithic
kernel and a modular one, with a choice of modules to
install.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x266d170"></a>X Marks the Spot</h2></div></div><p>First, I tried startx with the default settings, but all I
got was my monitor in standby mode and had to
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >COMMAND</b>-<b  >BACKSPACE</b>
to get out.</p><p>In the old days of Linux, you had to either edit your
XF86Config file by hand or find someone on the Net with the same
video card as you who had already done so. Today, some nice tools
can get you set up in X fairly quickly.
<span   class="bold"><b>Xautoconfig</b></span> runs from the command
line, and oddly enough, silently creates an appropriate XF86Config
file based on your hardware. (If it seems like nothing happens, it
worked. If you get a message of any sort, it probably didn't.)
<span   class="bold"><b>Xconfigurator</b></span> is a text menu-based
configuration tool, and the choices included the integrated video
card and monitor of the iMac, as well as an appropriate choice for
my three-button USB wheel mouse. I chose a 1024x768x16bpp setup, as
I knew from previous experience that 32bpp has some issues in the
latest <span   class="bold"><b>fbdev</b></span> X driver.</p><p>Now for the defining moment. I type <b  >startx -- -bpp
16</b> and I get the blue desktop and the X cursor, then back
to the command prompt. I try again with <b  >bpp 15</b>,
and I go straight into X with a default KDE desktop. There are some
snappy YDL links on the desktop leading to the YDL web site for
documentation and updates. Another minor annoyance is the &ldquo;Home&rdquo;
link generates an error that says &ldquo;config file has no `Type=...'
line&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Support&rdquo; link does launch Netscape and triggers my
demand-dialing connection on the server and takes me to Yellow
Dog's support page&mdash;yay, networking works! (See Figure 3.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4067f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. YDL Support Page
</p></div></div><p>Window motion is smooth, and no artifacts are generated while
dragging windows on the desktop. It appears I have accelerated
video. I pulled up the KDE control panel and played around a bit
with the various settings. Things look typical here, with the
requisite lists of themes, colors and window manager options. The
included X server has support for DPMS, which has been wanting on
the iMac. It seemed to work fine in testing. I tried enabling the
system sounds in the control panel, but all I got is one &ldquo;eep&rdquo;,
then nothing until I restarted X. (I also knew in advance that
sound has been an ongoing problem for Mac users. My previous
install has working sound only when I go right into Linux at boot.
If I do something in Mac OS first, no sound.)</p><p>My reading on the mailing lists indicates that
<span   class="bold"><b>esd</b></span> is the best working sound
server for PPC, so I launch &ldquo;switchdesk&rdquo;, change my desktop
environment to GNOME and restart X. GNOME now comes configured to
use sawmill, rather than Enlightenment, but there is an option in
the GNOME Toolbox to change to Enlightenment. (Watch it here,
because it says Enlightenment is the current window manager. I
actually had to select sawmill, save the changes, then select
Enlightenment to make it take. See Figure 5.) I do this, enable
system sounds and set up my preferred desktop theme, colors, etc.,
then shut down and restart X. I've got system sounds and am greeted
by a female voice welcoming me to Enlightenment (see Figure 6). I
pop in my favorite David Torn CD and run the GNOME CD player
applet, and I'm one happy camper. One annoyance is that restarting
X seems to place the blue desktop background over my chosen pattern
until I reset it. I found I had to go into GNOME's settings rather
than Enlightenment's to turn the blue background off.</p><p>

configuration, so I assigned the domain name, machine name and
fixed IP address I use for this machine. After rebooting, my
Ethernet connection was fine, and I edited the /etc/hosts file to
identify the other machines on my network by name. I could use
TELNET, rsh, FTP, etc. to get to my main server. By default,
incoming TELNET and FTP are disabled, which is a good thing,
especially if you are going to be connected to the Internet.</p><p>For PPP, I used the Red Hat Internet Configuration tool,
assigning the proper phone number, domain name and DNS information
for my ISP. I was able to connect on the first try. This area of
Linux has definitely improved for the first-time user. No more
editing PPP configuration files and dial-up scripts by hand. The
usual assortment of Internet applications are installed including
Pine, Netscape, <span   class="bold"><b>slrn</b></span> (this failed,
with a library error), Kmail,
<span   class="bold"><b>xchat</b></span>, archie and ncftp (see
Figures 7 and 8).</p><p>

have so many machines, I've opted to move my printers to a print
server that hangs on the network. The
<span   class="bold"><b>printtool</b></span> setup gives options for
setting up the printers, and an option is included for a remote
host. I have two printers, an NEC Silentwriter95 (PostScript) and
an HP DeskJet 693C. PostScript and ACSII printing worked fine on
both.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x266e458"></a>Applications</h2></div></div><p>YDL comes with the standard set of Linux applications. For
the office worker or student, you have Abiword and Gnumeric for
your word processor/spreadsheet combination. Not as full-featured
as some of the commercial applications, but certainly capable of
creating and printing a basic document. I did get an error related
to <span   class="bold"><b>gnome-print</b></span> when running
Gnumeric, but after re-installing the gnome-print RPM, the problem
went away. Both applications printed fine. The GIMP is included for
manipulating graphics files, as well as Electric Eyes. A number of
games are also included. One I found particularly entertaining is
Xboing, a spin on the old &ldquo;Breakout&rdquo; game with some slick effects
and sound (unfortunately, the sound was a bit distorted on the
iMac).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x266e5b8"></a>MOL</h2></div></div><p>MOL stands for Mac-On-Linux and it is a wonderful
contribution to PPC Linux, authored by Samuel Rydh. It can be run
as a window in X or in console mode using fbdev (the frame buffer),
and it allows you to use your existing Mac OS partition and
applications from within Linux. Sound doesn't work, but you can set
up a networking interface to access files and the Internet from
MOL. I've used MOL before on my CS1.1 installation, and it worked
quite well. For whatever reason, MOL on CS1.2 starts up but never
finishes the boot process. I get a number of messages referring to
an unsupported resource in the console from which it is launched.
Thinking it may be an issue with the 2.2.14 kernel I'm using, I
uninstalled the stock MOL and grabbed my copy from the other
partition. It also failed, but with a different error. Looks like
this one needs a little work. Again, it's most likely due to my
being unable to use YDL's kernel (see Figure 9).</p><p>

concept to the next level, querying an external network of
databases to download and upgrade your software packages on demand,
including itself, when necessary. From what I read on the mailing
lists, there were some initial problems with YUP and it went
through several rapid revisions, but in concept, it sounds like a
neat tool. If you run <b  >yup update</b>, it will go out
and find the newest versions of your software on the Internet and
update things for you. I prefer to control when and what I update,
but for inexperienced users, this could be a nice option.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x217b580.0x266ea30"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Linux, and in particular Linux on PPC, has come a long way.
Yellow Dog Linux Champion Server 1.2 is a very good package. I did
hit a couple of rough spots that may have stumped a first-time
user, but fortunately, I have the experience to work around them.
Were it not for my non-standard SCSI card in the iMac, things may
have gone much smoother. In the end I had a very usable Linux
system, not unlike what I use on x86 boxes (see Figure 10). I have
used LinuxPPC and had even more problems with it before I went to
Yellow Dog; however, that may have changed with LinuxPPC's newest
release. Many resources are available on the Net, including mailing
lists from both distributions as well as the mailing list/web site
that I help maintain:
<a href="http://www.imaclinux.net" target="_self">http://www.imaclinux.net/</a>.
If you've got a Mac and would like to give Linux a try, now is the
time. With MOL, you can now have the best of both worlds! If you do
decide to give Linux on PPC a try and get stuck, I'd be happy to
help where I can; drop me a line.</p><p>
