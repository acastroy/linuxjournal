(hopefully finished) spate of e-mail worms (mistakenly called
virii) passing among our Microsoft-using associates? Linux could
just as easily be the target. While its environment is much more
hostile, I still see too many posts to mail-list servers where the
sender address is &ldquo;root&rdquo;; these folks are very susceptible, and
so are the files of many non-privileged users. It could happen to
you. By default, most distributions of Linux are wide open. Even
those users who know it's not wise to read mail as root may have no
concept of how to secure their system from Net vandals. True, .vbx
scripts can't hurt us, but many of the services run by default
systems are able to. You can take comfort in the fact that the
Linux/UNIX community has helped by adding new rules to Sendmail to
strip off .vbx attachments that might have wiped out hundreds of
thousands of systems. Be safe; shut off services you don't need,
and make sure those you do need are current.
</p><p>Bartleby:
<a href="http://www.dahak.com/bartleby" target="_self">http://www.dahak.com/bartleby/</a></p><p>The author says the purpose of this program is to easily log
changes to systems. All you do is send a very short e-mail to
sysadmin (a one-line echo statement will work well). However,
<span   class="bold"><b>bartleby</b></span> works great for many
other things as well, e.g., a quick note when a check is sent off,
or when other daily tasks are completed. Messages can easily be
categorized by using a server name as a note category (perhaps
using a client's name). This message is parsed and inserted into an
SQL database, which can be accessed via a web browser. Look for
more improvements to this program soon. It requires Perl, MySQL (or
another relational database), DBD/DBI Perl modules, a web server
that can run cgi scripts, an MTA (Sendmail, smail, etc.) and a web
browser (Lynx, Netscape, et al.).</p><p>smtm:
<a href="http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/code/smtm.html" target="_self">rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/code/smtm.html</a></p><p>Show me the money! This particular utility will fetch quotes
from your list of stocks, so you can see how badly or well they are
doing. Display is configurable and will show price, last change,
volume traded and more. Negative price changes are reflected in
red. It requires Perl 5 with the following Perl modules: English,
Date::Manip, File::Spec, Getopt::Long, HTTP::Request::Common,
IO::File, POSIX, Tk, Tk::Balloon and Tk::FileSelect.</p><p>ttnews:
<a href="http://www.student.lu.se/~etn97ksi/sim_home/ttnews.html" target="_self">www.student.lu.se/~etn97ksi/sim_home/ttnews.html</a></p><p>This news ticker is for those who crave information overload.
Even I couldn't handle all the news it gave me with a default
install, and that's a lot of news. Fortunately,
<span   class="bold"><b>ttnews</b></span> comes with information on
how to configure it, and it's not difficult to do. It requires
libqt2, libX11, libXext, libstdc++, libm, glibc, bash and
Lynx.</p><p>arping:
<a href="http://synscan.nss.nu/programs.php3" target="_self">synscan.nss.nu/programs.php3</a></p><p>I travel to client sites often and like being able to connect
my laptop to their network and run tests against the system I'm
working on, grab files off my system and more (including keep up
with my e-mail while programs compile). To do so, I usually have to
bug the administrator to give me an unused IP if he's not running
DHCP (permission to connect is usually easy to obtain, but an IP is
much harder). Now there's a better way. This little utility allows
me to ping a couple of IPs before I grab one that's already in use
and stomp on it. It requires libnet and glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c6c580.0x1d64b88"></a>sendEmail:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://marvin.criadvantage.com/caspian/Software/SendEmail/default.php" target="_self">marvin.criadvantage.com/caspian/Software/SendEmail/default.php</a>
</p><p>I'd rather not install programs like Sendmail on a firewall
or other &ldquo;secure&rdquo; system; I like to keep what's on these systems
to a minimum. While Perl (which is needed for this program) isn't
exactly small, I use it for other things anyway, so I've found
<span   class="bold"><b>sendEmail</b></span> to be a useful addition
to my bag of tricks. The sendEmail utility is very powerful. In
fact, it looks like the next best thing to connecting directly to
the Sendmail server to which mail is delivered. While it won't
defeat a closed relay, it will allow you to rewrite the header in
just about any way you might wish. It requires Perl and the Perl
Socket module.</p><p>SICKnotes:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=3942" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=3942</a></p><p>SICKnotes can provide you with a web-based view of your
system inventory, configuration and knowledge base. It might be
overkill for a small home network; however, most businesses need
the kind of information this system stores. And while you may have
this information already, it is most likely stored in several
places rather than one (and possibly not available from just any
network-connected system). SICKnotes is an IT information system
worth looking at, since it can probably be reconfigured easily to
almost any department. It requires Python, MySQLdb Python module,
MySQL, a web server and a web browser.</p><p>cidr:
<a href="http://home.netcom.com/~naym/cidr.html" target="_self">home.netcom.com/~naym/cidr.html</a></p><p>Ever have one of those days where you just can't seem to
remember the netmask for a /25 address, or maybe the network and
broadcast addresses that correspond to it? Perhaps I'm just
brain-fried, but I sometimes find myself staring at a screen where
I have already typed <b  >ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.6
netmask</b> and thinking, &ldquo;Gee, I know this, I must use it
every other day, so why can't I remember it now?&rdquo; Well, just feed
<span   class="bold"><b>cidr</b></span> the basic information, IP
address and /25 or whatever, and the program provides the rest. At
this rate, I'll be able to stop thinking completely in another two
or three years. It requires glibc.</p><p>eatcookies:
<a href="http://www.ii.uib.no/~otto/eatcookies" target="_self">http://www.ii.uib.no/~otto/eatcookies/</a></p><p>Don't like cookies? Well
<span   class="bold"><b>eatcookies</b></span> is one hungry little
program that will gobble them up for good. Run it once&mdash;it will eat
all your Netscape cookies (at least those you allow) and won't
leave any crumbs. The program comes with a Netscape loader that
automatically runs eatcookies after Netscape exits, cleaning your
cookie file after each use. You can adjust eatcookies' diet via its
diet file. This may be little consolation, since some companies
have figured out how to keep your cookies on a third host where you
can't get to them, but that technology isn't widely used yet. It
requires Perl.</p></div></div>
