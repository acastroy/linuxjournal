    A host of system-on-chip silicon devices will help push embedded
    Linux into the post-PC era.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b1660"></a></h2></div></div><p>We've all heard about the coming
&ldquo;post-PC&rdquo; era. Are we there yet? Is it just around the corner? Or
is the post-PC era just a bunch of hype? After all, most of us
still use conventional PCs at work and home to do our computing.
</p><p>First, realize that the opportunity for computerized devices
which aren't PCs is practically limitless. International Data
Corporation (IDC) reports that out of the nearly two billion
microprocessor chips manufactured each year, over 95% go into
non-PC &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; devices. Today, most of this figure represents
low-level control tasks in vending machines, cars, test
instruments, sprinkler systems, etc.</p><p>But the smartness and interconnectedness of the myriad of
computerized devices that surround us will soon increase
dramatically. Recent technology advances make it possible to embed
PC-level computing, communications and display capabilities within
common appliances. They're also enabling the creation of many new
kinds of electronic gadgets&mdash;a process that is currently happening
at a furious pace in thousands of ongoing projects. Which means
nine months from now (products take roughly the same time to
gestate as human babies), the results of this frenzy of post-PC
development will begin to emerge in a big way.</p><p>So here's my prediction: 2001 will be &ldquo;the year of the
post-PC&rdquo;.</p><p>Each technology era tends to be characterized by a handful of
key, new technology threads that are woven into its fabric. In the
case of the post-PC era, those threads are likely to be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the Internet</p></li><li><p>Wireless LANs</p></li><li><p>Embedded Linux</p></li><li><p>Voice recognition</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;System-on-chip&rdquo; integrated circuits</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's zoom in on one of them: system-on-chip (SOC) integrated
circuits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b1ce8"></a>System-on-Chip: The Holy Grail of Embedded
Systems</h2></div></div><p>Chip companies have long sought to develop the means to build
entire systems on one piece of silicon. Imagine a single
super-high-density chip that you could program to perform all the
electronic functions your system needs. We're not there yet, but
we've certainly made a lot of progress.</p><p>As a hardware designer, I've personally experienced much of
that evolution. In 1980, the floppy controllers I designed required
entire boards full of chips. Soon, the designs compressed into two
chips. Then one. Ultimately, the whole thing literally
vanished&mdash;sucked into a super-I/O chip! Just a mere speck of
silicon and a few interface pins are all that remain.</p><p>As Moore's Law continued to work its magic, the half-dozen
circuit boards of the original PC eventually met similar fates. One
by one, each board-level controller became several chips, one chip,
and finally a fraction of a multi-function IC. By the end of the
'90s, the functions of a PC had been reduced to a handful of chips.
Would the final result be a single-chip PC?</p><p>The obvious answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. But the actual answer, for the
moment, is probably &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Why? It turns out there are still laws
of physics to contend with. Intel started pushing back on the
PC-on-a-chip idea several years ago, arguing that it's neither
efficient nor practical to implement everything on one piece of
silicon. Some partitioning of technologies, they reasoned, is
necessary in order to extract maximum benefits from the silicon and
to achieve the best cost and performance.</p><p>General-purpose PCs, and larger computers used as servers or
control systems, demand maximized CPU performance. Device
interfaces like Ethernet, sound and LCD controllers have more
specialized needs. These two priorities&mdash;CPU performance and device
interface&mdash;tend to make conflicting demands on the silicon. That's
why Intel has opted not to build its Pentium processors with
on-chip video, Ethernet and sound functions.</p><p>On the other hand, when you set out to create a web pad,
set-top box, Internet radio or smart vending machine, you face an
entirely different set of challenges. After all, you're designing
an appliance, not a PC. These embedded applications tend to be
interface-intensive, rather than compute-intensive. So you probably
don't need Intel's latest Pentium. In the past, you may have used a
single-chip microcontroller (8051, 68HC11, etc.). Today, there's an
exciting new alternative: the post-PC, Linux-oriented
system-on-chip. That's quite a mouthful! Let me explain.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>post-PC: Embedded applications don't need to be
&ldquo;Wintel&rdquo; compatible, since they're not trying to be
general-purpose PCs. Their CPUs can be x86 variants, but there can
be big advantages to RISC processors. Why? Because RISC CPUs tend
to be more efficient in their use of silicon resources. That can
result in higher performance and functional integration, at lower
power consumption and cost. Which is all great, provided you've got
the operating system software and tools you need to make the device
work the way you want. Which leads us to ...</p></li><li><p>Linux-oriented: In my opinion, embedded Linux will
be a key enabler of the post-PC era. Why? One reason is that Linux
isn't wedded to just one CPU architecture. Another is that Linux is
highly scalable, modular and flexible&mdash;which makes it well-suited
to the extreme diversity of embedded systems. Then, there's the
fact that Linux is open source, so it's much easier to get your
embedded widget to act like it's supposed to. Also, don't forget
the Linux royalty model&mdash;zero (or nearly so)&mdash;which makes all this
great stuff affordable in even the simplest of devices.</p></li><li><p>system-on-chip: Right now, a whole new class of
system-on-chip processors is emerging. They're popping up
everywhere, on an almost weekly basis. These highly integrated and
easy-to-design-with little tidbits of silicon now contain powerful
32-bit CPUs, along with a feast of built-in peripheral interfaces.
Best of all, they're nearly all supported with ready-to-run
embedded Linux.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b2210"></a>A Post-PC SOC Checklist</h2></div></div><p>Here's my checklist of minimal requirements for a post-PC
SOC:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>32-bit CPU</p></li><li><p>Built-in interface to RAM and ROM</p></li><li><p>Built-in DMA, interrupt and timing
controllers</p></li><li><p>Built-in interface to disk or flash memory</p></li><li><p>Built-in Ethernet and/or LCD/CRT interface</p></li><li><p>Built-in serial and parallel ports and/or
USB</p></li><li><p>Full embedded Linux support</p></li></ul></div><p>Why require either built-in Ethernet or a display controller?
That's because some SOCs go in &ldquo;black box&rdquo; devices that don't
need displays, such as firewalls, specialized servers or gateways,
while others go in user-interactive devices like web pads and
vending machines. By including at least one of these two popular
external world interfaces, the SOC implements all the key functions
of the required embedded computer.
</p><p>Are there any SOCs that currently meet all the requirements
on my checklist? You bet! For several months, I've been gathering
info on post-PC Linux-oriented SOCs. Here's a sampling of what I've
found.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>STMicroelectronics STPC Industrial&mdash;contains an
