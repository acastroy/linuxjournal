      I was more than surprised to see the October cover of
      <i  >Linux Journal</i>. What exactly was the idea behind putting the map of
    Indonesia
    and Indonesia Sea on it?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bed580.0x1ce51e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>My national patriotism is very hurt by
putting Dili on the map with no reference whatsoever to East Timor.
Dili IS NOT INDONESIA! Dili is an indivisible part of East Timor,
and by the United Nations Resolution, Portugal is still the
rightful administrative power of East Timor. The Indonesian
government has shown no regard for the human rights, and refuses
the right of self-determination of the people of East
Timor.  &mdash;Daniel Bernardodaniel.bernardo@visus.alce.pt
</p><p>Dear Sir,</p><p>Let me congratulate you and your team for all the work you
have done to benefit the Linux Community. The October issue of
<i  >LJ</i> was once more a good example of what a
magazine should be&mdash;both instructive and entertaining.</p><p>Although your introduction to the Java world was quite good,
I was a bit disappointed you didn't refer to the wonderful
relationship between the Java world and the Linux world. An
interview with Randy Chapman would maybe be in order. Perhaps
focusing on Sun's license restrictions and (dare I say it?)
aggressive position towards the Linux Community would also not be a
bad idea. Maybe for a future Java II issue?</p><p>Finally, I would just like to point out a geographical error
in your cover: the city of Dili, as well as half the island it is
on (East Timor), is <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> a part of
Indonesia. In the eyes of the UN, it is still a Portuguese colony.
It was invaded in 1974 by Indonesia, and its people (the Maubere)
are still fighting for their freedom. I know it's not your duty to
know this, but you'll also understand it is mine to report
it.</p><p>Keep up the good work!  &mdash;Filipe
Cust&oacute;diofmc@novabase.pt</p><p>Just a couple of weeks after receiving your letters, in a
strange coincidence, the Nobel Committee jointly awarded East
Timor's Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and exiled
resistance leader Jose Ramos-Horta the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize for
their efforts in the 21-year-old conflict with Indonesia.</p><p>The prize draws international attention to the situation and
awards US$1.12 million to the recipients, which Committee Chairman
Francis Sejersted said was for &ldquo;their work toward a just and
peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor.&rdquo;</p><p>In 1975, shortly after Portugal pulled out of what had been a
Portuguese colony, the Indonesian government moved in and annexed
East Timor a year later, an action which the United Nations has
never recognized.</p><p>But <i  >Linux Journal</i> is not a magazine
about world politics, so I leave further investigation to the
interested readers; a web search I did suggests there is ample
reading material available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bed580.0x1ce5710"></a>More Graphics Standards</h2></div></div><p>In the November 1996 issue (#31), Jorg-Rudiger Hill wrote an
article entitled &ldquo;Linux Goes 3D: An Introduction to Mesa/OpenGL&rdquo;.
In the article, he writes, &ldquo;OpenGL is the standard for 3D computer
graphics and is managed by the Architecture Review Board.&rdquo; Then,
on page 27, this text is enlarged and quoted in a box.</p><p>I would like to point out there are other standards for 3-D
graphics besides OpenGL. A visit to the ANSI web site
(www.ansi.org) reveals two. First, the Graphical Kernel System
(GKS) is a graphics standard which now has 3-D extensions (ANSI
X3.124-1985). Second, the Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive
Graphics System (PHIGS) is a newer standard (ANSI/ISO 9592-1-1989)
with many features OpenGL lacks. You may have also heard of PEX,
PHIGS Extensions to X, which supports networked 3-D
graphics.</p><p>These are just some thoughts for you to consider.  &mdash;John F.
Bunchbuncho@ro.com</p><p>Readers may want to check out the comp.graphics.misc FAQ by
John Griegg at http://www.primenet.com/~grieggs/cg_faq.html. On PEX

probably more than a year and have finally gotten around to
subscribing.</p><p>I just wanted to take this opportunity to tell you what a
great magazine I think it is, because you probably wouldn't hear
from me otherwise. I fully support your content policy of mixing
novice-level articles with advanced topics. As you have stated in
at least one response to a reader, I can overlook those articles
that don't apply to me now, because more than likely, I will go
back to them in the future. This makes <i  >LJ</i> a
wonderful reference. I have already used back issues as such on
more than a couple of occasions.</p><p>I have upgraded to Linux 2.0 and have finally deleted all my
DOS partitions from all machines except for one (and I'm working on
that...). I couldn't have done it without y'all (little Texas lingo
there), and I will remain a subscriber as long as you continue to
provide such an outstanding product.  &mdash;Keith

of Freedom&rdquo; but take issue with your statement that &ldquo;Bill Gates
[should] yield to market pressure and make his software freely
available...&rdquo; Microsoft is a corporation that earns its revenue
from selling software. As CEO of this corporation, Bill Gates'
responsibility is to maximize by legal means the profits of
Microsoft. If he were to suggest giving away the software of
Microsoft, he would be swiftly and justifiably fired by the Board
of Directors.</p><p>I am grateful for the efforts of the free software community,
but its members must remember that commercial software companies
have a responsibility to protect their software to the extent that
it increases profits and benefits shareholders.  &mdash;Vivek
