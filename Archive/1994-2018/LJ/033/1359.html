    So you're gathering information from your surfers; what now?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dea580.0x1ee2558"></a></h2></div></div><p>This time, we are going to look at one of
the most common things that people want their CGI programs to do,
namely save data to files on disk. By the end of the column, we
will have accumulated enough tools to produce a simple, but
functional guest-book program that will allow visitors to your site
to save comments that can be read by others.
</p><p>For starters, let's look at a simple HTML form that will
allow users to send data to our CGI program, which we will call
&ldquo;entryform.pl&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Data entry form&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Data entry form&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;Form action="/cgi-bin/entryform.pl"
method=POST&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Name: &lt;input type=text name="name"
value=""&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;E-mail address: &lt;input type=text
name="email" value=""&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Address: &lt;input type=text
name="address" value=""&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Country: &lt;input type=text
name="country" value=""&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Male &lt;input type=radio name="sex"
value="male"&gt;
Female &lt;input type=radio name="sex"
value="female"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;input type=submit&gt;
&lt;/Form&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Of course, an HTML form won't do anything on its own; it
needs a CGI program to accept and process its input. Below is a
Perl5 program that, if named &ldquo;entryform.pl&rdquo; and placed in the
main &ldquo;/cgi-bin&rdquo; directory on a web server, should print out the
name-value pairs that arrive from the above form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5
1    # We want to use the CGI module
2    use CGI;
3    # Create a new CGI object
4    my $query = new CGI;
5    # Print an a appropriate MIME header
6    print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
7    # Print a title for the page
8    print $query-&gt;start_html(-title=&gt;"Form
     contents");
9    # Print all of the name-value pairs
10   print $query-&gt;dump();
11   # Finish up the HTML
12   print $query-&gt;end_html;
</pre><p>Here's a quick run-down of what each line of code does:</p><p>Line 0 tells a Unix box where to find the Perl interpreter.
If your copy of Perl is called something else, you need to modify
this line.</p><p>Without explicitly importing the CGI module in line 2, Perl
wouldn't know how to create and use CGI objects. (Trying to use
code from a module you haven't imported is guaranteed to confuse
Perl and generate error messages.) We then declare $query to be an
instance of CGI (line 4).</p><p>We then tell the user's browser that our response will be
HTML-formatted text, and we do that by using a MIME header. The
lack of a MIME header is the most common reason for a 500 error;
whenever one of your CGI programs produces one of these, make sure
that you aren't trying to print HTML before the header! Note that
line 6 is equivalent to saying:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
</pre><p>which also tells the browser to expect text data formatted in
HTML. In general, though, I prefer to use the CGI object for
readability reasons.
</p><p>Line 8 creates the basic HTML necessary to begin the
document, including giving it the title, &ldquo;Form contents&rdquo;.</p><p>Line 10 uses the CGI object's built-in facility for
&ldquo;dumping&rdquo; an HTML form's contents in an easy-to-read format. This
allows us to see what value was assigned to each of the elements of
the HTML form, which can be invaluable in debugging problematic
programs. For now, though, we are just using the CGI &ldquo;dump&rdquo;
method to get ourselves started and confirm that the program
works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dea580.0x1ee2a80"></a>Saving the Data to a File</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have proven that our HTML form is sending data to
our CGI program, and that our program can send its output back to
the user's web browser, let's see what we can do with that data.
For starters, let's try to save the data from the form to a file on
disk. (This is one of the most common tasks that clients ask me to
implement, usually because they want to collect data about their
visitors.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl5
# We want to use the CGI module
use CGI;
# Set the filename to which we want the elements
# saved
my $filename = "/tmp/formcontents";
# Set the character that will separate fields in
# the file
my $separation_character = "\t";
# Create a new CGI object
my $query = new CGI;
# ----------------------------------------------
# Open the file for appending
open (FILE, "&gt;&gt;$filename") ||
        die "Cannot open \"$filename\"!\n";
# Grab the elements of the HTML form
@names = $query-&gt;param;
# Iterate through each element from the form,
# writing each element to $filename. Separate
# elements with $separation_character defined
# above.
foreach $index (0 .. $#names)
{
        # Get the input from the appropriate
        # HTML form element
        $input = $query-&gt;param($names[$index]);
        # Remove any instances of
        # $separation_character
        $input =~ s/$separation_character//g;
        # Now add the input to the file
        print FILE $input;
        # Don't print the separation character
        # after the final element

print FILE $separation_character if
                ($index &lt; $#names);
}
# Print a newline after this user's entry
print FILE "\n";
# Close the file
close (FILE);
# -----------------------------------------------
# Now thank the user for submitting his
# information
# Print an a appropriate MIME header
print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
# Print a title for the page
print $query-&gt;start_html(-title=&gt;"Thank you");
# Print all of the name-value pairs
print "&lt;P&gt;Thank you for submitting the ";
print "form.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
print "&lt;P&gt;Your information has been ";
print "saved to disk.&lt;/P7gt;\n";
# Finish up the HTML
print $query-&gt;end_html;
</pre><p>The above program is virtually identical to the previous one,
except that we have added a section that takes each of the HTML
form elements and saves them to a file. Each line in the resulting
file corresponds to a single press of the HTML form's &ldquo;submit&rdquo;
button.
</p><p>The above program separates fields with a TAB character, but
we could just as easily have used commas, tildes or the letter
&ldquo;a&rdquo;. Remember, though, that someone is eventually going to want
to use this data&mdash;either by importing it into a database or by
splitting it apart with Perl or another programming language. To
ensure that the user doesn't mess up our database format, we remove
any instances of the separation character in the user's input with
Perl's substitution(s) operator. A bit Draconian, but
effective!</p><p>One of the biggest problems with the above program is that it
depends on the HTML form elements always coming in the same order.
That is, if you have elements X, Y and Z on an HTML form, will they
be placed in @names in the same order as they appear in the form?
In alphabetical order? In random order? To be honest, there isn't
any way to be sure, since the CGI specifications are silent on the
matter. It's possible, then, that one user's form will be submitted
in the order (X, Y, Z), while another's will be submitted as (Y, Z,
X)&mdash;which could cause problems with our data file, in which fields
are identified by their position.</p><p>A simple fix is to maintain a list of the fields that we
expect to receive from the HTML form. This requires a bit more
coordination between the program and the form, but given that the
same person often works on both, that's a minor concern.</p><p>First, we define a list, <b  >@fields</b>, near the
top of the program. This list contains the names of all of the
fields that we expect to receive, in the order that we expect to
receive them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my @fields = ("name",
                     "email",
                     "address",
                     "country",
                     "sex");
</pre><p>Next, we change the &ldquo;foreach&rdquo; loop (which places the field
elements in the output file) such that it iterates through the
elements of <b  >@fields</b>, rather than
<b  >@names</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foreach $index (0 .. $#fields)
{
  # Get the input from the appropriate HTML form
  # element
  $input = $query-&gt;param($fields[$index]);
  # Remove any instances of $separation_character

  $input =~ s/$separation_character//g;
  # Now add the input to the file
  print FILE $input;
  # Don't print the separation character after the
  # final element
  print FILE $separation_character if
        ($index &lt; $#fields);
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dea580.0x1ee2fa8"></a>Required Fields</h2></div></div><p>What if we want to make sure that users have filled out
certain fields? This is particularly important when we are
collecting data about visitors to a site, and want to make sure
that we receive their names, addresses and other vital data. A
simple way to do that is to create a list,
<b  >@required_fields</b>, in which the required fields
are listed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my @required_fields = ("name",
                              "email",
                              "address");
</pre><p>If you simply want a generic message indicating that one or
more required fields haven't been filled out, you can add the
following subroutine at the bottom of the program file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub missing_field
{
  # Print an a appropriate MIME header
  print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
  # Print a title for the page
  print $query-&gt;start_html(-title=&gt;
  "Missing field(s)");
  # Tell the user what the error is
  print "&lt;P&gt;At least one required ";
  print "field is missing.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
  # Finish up the HTML
  print $query-&gt;end_html;

}
</pre><p>We can then insert the following code into the program itself, just
before we open the file&mdash;since there isn't any reason to open the
file if we are simply going to close it again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foreach $field (@required_fields)
{
  # Make sure that the field contains more than
  # just whitespace
  &amp;missing_field if
  ($query-&gt;param($field) !~m/\w/);
  exit;
}
</pre><p>The above code will indeed do the trick, but gives a generic error
message. Wouldn't it be better to tell the user
<span   class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> field contains the error? We can do that
by modifying missing_field such that it takes an argument, as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub missing_field
{
  # Get our local variables
  my (@missing_fields) = @_;
  # Print an a appropriate MIME header
  print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
  # Print a title for the page
  print $query-&gt;start_html
  (-title=&gt;"Missing field(s)");
  print "&lt;P&gt;You are missing the following ";
  print "required fields:&lt;/P&gt;\n";
  print "&lt;ul&gt;\n";
  # Iterate through the missing fields, printing
  # them foreach $field (@missing_fields)
  {
    print "&lt;li&gt; $field\n";
  }
  print "&lt;/ul&gt;\n";

  # Finish up the HTML
  print $query-&gt;end_html;
  exit;
}
</pre><p>We then modify the loop that checks for required fields:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
foreach $field (@required_fields)
{
  # Add the name of each missing field
  push (@missing_fields, $field) if
   ($query-&gt;param($field) !~ m/\w/);
}
# If @missing_fields contains any elements, then
# invoke the error routine
&amp;missing_field(@missing_fields)
  if @missing_fields;
</pre><p>If we want to get really fancy, we can provide English names for
each of the required fields, so that users don't have to suffer
through the names we used with the HTML form. We can do that by
using associative arrays:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$FULLNAME{"name"} = "your full name";
$FULLNAME{"email"} = "your e-mail address";
$FULLNAME{"address"} = "your mailing address";
</pre><p>Then we modify the foreach loop in &amp;missing_fields such that it
prints the full name of the missing field, rather than the name
associated with it on the HTML form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Iterate through the missing fields, printing
# them foreach $field (@missing_fields)
{
  print "&lt;li&gt; $FULLNAME{$field}\n";
}
print "&lt;/ul&gt;\n";
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dea580.0x1ee35d8"></a>Dying with Style</h2></div></div><p>Remember that <b  >die</b> statement we put in our
original program? Well, think about what will happen if that part
of the program is ever truly invoked&mdash;<b  >die</b> will
produce an error message, which is a good thing. But that error
message will be sent to our web browser, before the HTML header,
giving us the dreaded &ldquo;Server error&rdquo; message, indicating that
something (but not saying what that something is) has gone wrong
with our script.</p><p>More useful would be a routine that printed the error message
to the screen. For example, we could add the following
subroutine:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub error_opening_file
{
    my ($filename) = @_;
    # Print an a appropriate MIME header
    print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
    # Print a title for the page
    print $query-&gt;start_html(-title=&gt;"Error
    opening file");
    # Print the error
    print "Could not open the file
    \"$filename\".&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    # Finish up the HTML
    print $query-&gt;end_html;
    exit;
}
</pre><p>And now, we can rewrite the &ldquo;open&rdquo; statement as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open (FILE, "&gt;&amp;gt:$filename") ||
  &amp;error_opening_file($filename);
</pre><p>You probably don't want to tell your users your program couldn't
open a particular file&mdash;not only do your users not care, but you
don't need to tell them which files you are using. A more
user-friendly version of <b  >error_opening_file</b>
could tell the user that the server is experiencing some trouble,
or is undergoing maintenance or give a similar message that doesn't
broadcast catastrophe to the world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dea580.0x1ee39a0"></a>Bringing It All Together</h2></div></div><p>The final version of the program, with (a) required fields,
(b) full-English descriptions of those fields, and (c) a better

      since early 1993, when it seemed like more of a fun toy than the
      world's Next Great Medium. He currently works from his apartment in
      Haifa, Israel as an independent Internet and Web consultant. When
      not working on the Web or informally volunteering with school-age
      children, he enjoys reading (just about any subject, but especially
      computers, politics, and philosophy&mdash;separately and together),
      cooking, solving crossword puzzles and hiking.
