machine.</p></li><li><p>Netactive Systems, LTD.</p></li><li><p>Price: $3,472 (as of August 5, 1996)</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Jonathan Gross</p></li></ul></div><p>Sitting on my desk is a 100mhz 486DX-4 workstation with 32M
of RAM. It has cables falling out of the case, the cover is just
sitting on the floor, the wiring is a mess, and god only knows
where the manuals for the components are. It took me at least two
days to get all the pieces working together, X configured, and
everything running relatively smoothly&mdash;and probably cost me around
$2,000.</p><p>My DX4-100 is relatively fast; I can run a couple copies of
XEmacs on it, and a kernel compile takes around twelve minutes. Not
too bad, and certainly better than the 386-25 sitting in my closet
next to it, or the 486-33 in the living room.</p><p>The DX4-100 was enough until something happened at
work.</p><p>A company called Netactive Systems, Ltd. sent <i  >Linux Journal</i> a machine to try out&mdash;their SynergieServer Pro.
My DX4-100 isn't so fast anymore.</p><p>I am impressed with Netactive. Usually when you buy a
machine, either from a local vendor or mail-order, it is a fairly
sterile transaction. You hand them your credit card and they
blithely hand you a box full of electronics&mdash;it's kind of like
going to the Motel 6 of computer stores. Netactive is more like
going to the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel to buy a machine.</p><p>Every machine is put together by an engineer who approves it
for shipping. Before it is shipped the same engineer writes a
letter to the recipient explaining the configuration and highlights
of the system. An excerpt from ours:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Fundamentally, it does not take much
engineering excellence to put together a great $15,000 dollar
Intel-based computer; just buy a couple of everything with a great
big name on its shiny new box and throw it together. It does,
however, take a little bit of know-how to make a truly great $3,500
machine...&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The letter goes on to explain that they put 64M of RAM and a
nice video card into it instead of SCSI Wide because Caldera (the
installed Linux) is a GUI environment, and the RAM and good video
card are going to be a better use of your money than faster
disks.</p><p>This is cool. It gives you a much better idea of what is in
the machine, and why (and even that there is a &ldquo;why&rdquo;!) than the
usual random checklist of components does. The random list of
components is also included, as is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sysadmins
Configuration Guide</em></span>, which lists all the configuration
settings, from IRQ and hardware addresses to domain name and host
name of the machine to the disk partitioning. Both the list of
parts and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sysadmin Configuration Guide</em></span> are
sent loose with the other paperwork, and a second copy is taped to
the inside of the case. The other paperwork includes: a warranty
certificate (three years limited parts, and five year limited
labor), the build sheet, and an invoice, all with customer numbers,
job number, and serial number for technical support calls and
tracking information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ab9580.0x1bb1be0"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>In the machine is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Motherboard</b></span>: Asus

PCI/Media Bus, 3 ISA slots, Optional Infra-red port, and 64MB FPM

sink and fan).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Drives</b></span>: Asus

and, of course, all the manuals and documentation for everything
neatly packed in Manila envelopes.</p></li></ul></div><p>This all came in a <span   class="bold"><b>very</b></span>

loader (which I despise), Linux was all there, configured and
running the way it should be running. I never booted NT, but I
assume it was configured just as carefully.</p><p>NT brought up the one thing I didn't like about this machine.
I would rather use LILO to boot Linux, and not have NT on the drive
at all&mdash;I'm sure this configuration could be requested if you too
want a Linux-only set-up.</p><p>The system was fast&mdash;we ran the informal JonGrossSpeedTest
(building a kernel). Note that both machines had enough RAM so that
swapping wasn't an issue...</p><p>Jon Gross Machine Speed Test results:</p><p>For kernel version 2.0.10 on the Netactive machine (timed
