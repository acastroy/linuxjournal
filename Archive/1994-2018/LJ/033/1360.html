      Where does Caldera go next? <i  >LJ</i> Interviewed their

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2360580.0x2458450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I had an opportunity to talk to Bryan
Sparks at the Unix Expo trade show in New York on October 9. In the
past, Caldera has offered a different sort of Linux to the
market&mdash;one aimed at the &ldquo;professional&rdquo; end user. In other words,
people who want to use applications, and who just happen to be
running a Linux machine. But, with market penetration less than
expected, Caldera has made some changes.
</p><p>On October 7, Caldera announced the release of their
Solutions CD, which includes software from Caldera and their
Independent Vendor Partners (IVPs). This release offers a set of
applications for the Linux market while giving the IVPs access to
the global Linux market. The CD contains software that can be
released by getting an access key from Caldera. See the sidebar on
page FIXME for a list of the products available on this CD. Most of
these products are not specifically licensed for use only on
Caldera Linux, which means that Caldera is bringing some serious
applications to the general Linux community.</p><p>Caldera's second announcement was the licensing of Novell's
Cross-Platform Services for use on Linux, allowing Caldera Linux
platforms to work in a fully integrated fashion with Novell Netware
and IntranetWare systems. Other licensees of this technology
include Hewlett-Packard and The Santa Cruz Operation (SCO).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2360580.0x2458608"></a>Three New Products</h2></div></div><p>Finally, in order to better address the needs of different
market segments, Caldera is introducing three Linux-based systems
targeted at different market segments. These new products are
collectively called Caldera OpenLinux (COL) and are based on the
Linux 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel. The effort to produce this
integrated set of products started with LaserMoon who did the first
work toward X/Open and other certifications. Caldera is now working
with Linux System Technologies of Erlangen, Germany to complete the
integration of Caldera and LaserMoon's work with additional
technologies.</p><p>Bryan and I talked about &ldquo;their&rdquo; technologies vs. the
standard development paths. Bryan assured me Caldera's intent was
to make any necessary changes for POSIX certification and Unix
branding available to the Linux community as a whole. He sees
Caldera's products as part of the total product mix for the Linux
community and wants to make sure Caldera's work continues to be
part of the mainstream.</p><p>The low-end product, called COL Base, is much like the
original Caldera Network Desktop. The big changes are the
elimination of a Netware (IPX) client and a change in price from
$99 to $59. It will also include the Caldera Solutions CD. Bryan
said he thinks this will be a better fit for the casual user&mdash;a
Windows-like desktop environment at a price more in line with
other, plainer, Linux distributions.</p><p>The second product, COL Workstation, will be COL Base plus
Netscape Navigator 3.0 Gold, Netware Client and Administration, a
commercial, secure web server and other technologies yet to be
announced. This product will retail for less than $300.</p><p>The final product is COL Server. It will include the features
of COL Workstation plus Cross Platform Services and GroupWise
technologies licensed from Novell. It will be fully capable of
interacting as a secure server in an environment that includes
NetWare, Unix and Windows NT systems on an intranet or the
Internet. This product will offer an alternative to Microsoft's NT
Server and will retail for less than $1,500.</p><p>COL Base should be available by the time you read this
article. The other products will be introduced throughout 1997,
with upgrade options available for current Caldera users.</p><p>I also asked about support. Caldera includes their own
Internet-based support for all products, and will include 30-day
installation support on the workstation and server products.</p><p>Caldera has over 200 resellers under contract. In order to
qualify for the reseller program, the resellers must have Unix
training, so that Caldera is assured that they can support the
products they sell. Bryan said many of these resellers have been
resellers of SCO Unix or UnixWare.</p><p>I asked Bryan if Caldera intended to continue with Unix
branding of their product. (To be able to use the Unix name, your
product must be certified by X/Open.) The answer is yes, and he
expects this to happen in 1997. Bryan wants to make sure Caldera
does this right, getting any required patches back into the
mainstream Linux kernel so everyone will benefit from their
work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2360580.0x2458a28"></a>What This Means for Linux</h2></div></div><p>Right now Linux is seeing substantial use as a system for
connectivity, including web servers, Internet Service Providers and
gateway systems to connect office networks to the Internet. With
Caldera's new products, it is going to be much easier for companies
to put these systems together. This ease of use saves time for the
Linux-literate who want to get a system up, and makes it possible
for the newbie to buy an answer off the shelf. This means there
really is an answer to Windows NT.</p><p><a href="1360s1.html" target="_self">Caldera Solutions</a></p></div></div>
