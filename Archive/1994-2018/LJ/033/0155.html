    So you think client-server programming is only for large
    applications?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1680500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Client-server applications are
everywhere. Client-server can be defined as a process which
provides services to other processes. The client and server can be
run on the same machine or on different machines on opposite sides
of the world. A non-programming example of a client-server
situation is the telephone system. You are the client (or customer)
and the central office is the server. By having a telephone
connected to the system (and your bill current!) you are
subscribing to the services that the central office provides.
Requests are made of the server (central office) to place and
receive calls. The server also does accounting on each call made or
received and handles emergency (911) requests. In this article I
will present a simple CB (citizen's band) radio simulator which was
written for a class project. The server is written in C and the
client is written in Java. I will assume that the reader
understands what sockets are and has a rough idea of how they are
used.</p><p>The specifications for the project were loosely:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Provide a server which can accept multiple
simultaneous connections. The server should have a basic command
set that will open and close the connection, change the channel and
provide a list of current clients on a specific channel.</p></li><li><p>Provide an &ldquo;emergency channel&rdquo; (9) that will
broadcast all traffic to all currently connected clients regardless
of which channel they are subscribed to.</p></li><li><p>Client should &ldquo;come up&rdquo; on channel 19. This is the
channel where CBers meet. They then agree which channel to move to
in order to continue their conversation.</p></li><li><p>The client should display all traffic on the
current channel with the handle of the person who sent the
message.</p></li><li><p>The server can be either a single process
concurrent or multiple process server (more on this later).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1680a28"></a>Why Java?</h2></div></div><p>Besides getting extra credit for doing a graphical user
interface, I chose Java in order to simplify programming of the
client. Java is used specifically for the following reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Portability</b></span>. I was
developing code at home on my Linux system and running the code on
Suns at school.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Functionality</b></span>. Not
just for web page animations, Java is a very useful programming
language. Java is object-oriented and very similar to C and C++. A
simple user interface is relatively easy to write.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Threads</b></span>. Java
allows multiple threads (like a background process) of execution. A
thread can be launched that will listen for incoming messages. When
a message comes in, it is automatically sent to output. We start
this thread and forget about it.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Can be run remotely from
Netscape (or similar browser)</b></span>. While I have not
currently implemented this feature, conceivably, web surfers
looking at your page could talk to each other using the CB
simulator. There are many restrictions to this which we will go
into later.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1680fa8"></a>Why Not C?</h2></div></div><p>Using C for the client would require more programming to
accomplish the same results. First, some sort of GUI builder like
Motif or X-Forms would need to be used. I'm not knocking any of
these, but not every system has them and they can be difficult to
learn and use. C does not have threads, so all I/O would have to be
polled. User input as well as incoming messages would have to be
polled and processed accordingly. Without a GUI, some type of
command codes would have to be developed for the user to control
the client and server. This would probably be very cryptic and
difficult to use&mdash;not to mention difficult to implement.</p><p>I developed the server first, from the specification in
<a href="0155s1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a>. Messages are fixed length
and must not vary from the given format. C handles transmissions
well through the use of structures and pointers; basically, you
just call a write or read routine, passing a pointer to the data
structure, and the bytes come or go without much of a problem. This
works fine for C; Java is another story.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1681160"></a>A Few Words on Sockets</h2></div></div><p>Sockets work almost the same in Java as their counterparts in
C. Since Java is object-oriented, you must create an instance of
the socket object. This is done by a simple line of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Socket s = new Socket(hostName,portNumber);
</pre><p>where <b  >s</b> is the instance of type
<b  >Socket</b> and
<b  >hostName,portNumber</b> are the name of the host and
port to connect to. But a socket by itself is not very useful
without a data input and data output stream. The code segment below
sets up a data input and output stream to talk to the socket:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dis= new DataInputStream(s.getInputStream());
dos= new DataOutputStream(new
BufferedOutputStream(s.getOutputStream()));
</pre><p>The output stream is created as a buffered output stream.
Data will not be written across the socket unless either Java feels
that there is enough data to write, or you force a write&mdash;using a
flush by using something like: <b  >dos.flush()</b>; this
calls the flush method on the data output stream. On the reading
side of the socket, we can simply go into an infinite loop and poll
for data from the server, since the listener is running as a
separate thread.</p><p>Java has most of the same basic data types as C, with a few
exceptions. Java has no unsigned integers, but it does have true
booleans. To construct the data packet, use a combination of
Integers and an array of 120 bytes for the handle and message
fields. The data output and input streams have methods for reading
and writing integers and bytes. For example,
<b  >dos.writeInt(1);</b> would write the integer &ldquo;1&rdquo; to
the data output stream. Conversely, <b  >for (int
i=0;i&lt;120;i++) dos.writeByte(buffer[i]);</b>
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> <b  >dos.readByte(buffer[i])</b>
to read) would write the entire buffer to the socket;
<b  >dos.flush()</b> will make sure that the data is
written now and not delayed. It is important to note that we must
write or read all of the data (command, channel, handle and
message) to or from the server even if all we want to do is change
the channel. The server expects this; otherwise it will hang,
waiting for all of the bytes to come or go.</p><p>One more obstacle remains. How to get the handle and message
data into the proper position in the byte array? In the event
handler we create string objects for the message and handle, then
call the <b  >getBytes()</b> method on the string
objects.
<b  >message.getBytes(0,message.length(),buffer,20);</b>
will copy <b  >message.length()</b> bytes from the string
object <b  >message</b> starting at position
<b  >0</b> in the string to the byte array
<b  >buffer</b> starting at position
<b  >20</b>. One thing that is missing in my program is
error checking. It would be absolutely necessary in a production
program to check and recheck to make sure that you don't overflow
the buffer by writing more bytes than the buffer can hold.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x16819f8"></a>The Server</h2></div></div><p>The server is a simple single-process concurrent server.
Simply put, the server polls each connection, and processes
requests in order. An alternative would be to fork a new process
for each incoming connection. In this situation the single process
server is far simpler (and, after all, the computer can only really
do one thing at a time). The basic order of things is:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create the master socket on the well-known
port.</p></li><li><p>Bind the socket so that incoming requests are
directed to the proper place.</p></li><li><p>Listen for connections.</p></li><li><p>Accept incoming connections.</p></li></ol></div><p>The &ldquo;well-known port&rdquo; is a port which is known to all
clients. All clients can't connect to the same port, so the server
&ldquo;hands off&rdquo; connection requests to a different port. This is done
by the TCP/IP layer, and we don't need to concern ourselves about
how. This process is analogous to that of making a phone call to a
large corporation's toll free number. Suppose that you wish to call
1-800-257-1234. You are asking the server for a connection on that
port (phone) number. This company probably has hundreds of lines,
but you would not want to try each of them until you finally got
through, so the corporation has set up a rotary on their lines to
put connections through to the next available phone line.</p><p>TCP/IP sockets work the same way. When a connection is
accepted on a socket, a new file descriptor is created. The file
descriptor is used as an index to an array of structures. Every
client has exactly one unique file descriptor and a slot in the
client array. Each array position holds a structure which contains
the handle and current channel number. When the server receives a
message packet, it looks through the entire array and retransmits
the message to all clients who are subscribed to the channel number
that the message came from.</p><p>Currently supported server commands are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >CB_ON</b> sets the client's channel
to 19 and sends a welcome message. It also stores the handle in the
client array.</p></li><li><p><b  >CB_OFF</b> closes the socket and
clears the client info from the client array.</p></li><li><p><b  >SET_CHAN</b> changes the channel of
the client in the client array.</p></li><li><p><b  >WHO_CHAN</b> sends a message
containing the handles of all connected clients subscribed to the
current channel.</p></li><li><p><b  >SEND-MESSAGE</b> sends the message
contained in the message field of the data packet to each client
subscribed to the same channel as the originator. Emergency traffic
on channel 9 is also sent to all connected clients regardless of
what channel they are subscribed to. As stated earlier, the server
must have all bytes in the data packet sent or received at once. It
is not possible (with this implementation) to send part of a
packet.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1a7a6f0"></a>The Client</h2></div></div><p>My original goal was to make a client that looked like a CB
radio panel. This turned out to be too difficult to do with Java;
while Java is a good portable programming language, creating a
complex user interface is very difficult. I adapted my client from
an example in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></span> by David
Flanagan, O'Reilly &amp; Associates (an excellent book&mdash;great for
reference). The CB client user interface is very simple. A Connect
menu is at the top. From here, the user can quit or ask the server
who is on the current channel. The middle window is the message
area. Here all messages from other users and the server are listed.
The client will print the handle and message from the data packet.
The server is responsible for the data in those packets as it will
put &ldquo;System: WHO&rdquo; in the handle for a WHO request. The bottom field
is for entering a new channel. When Java detects activity in the
menu bar or channel field, it will call the event handler routine.
From here, it determines where the event came from and performs the
appropriate processing. The user interface is not much&mdash;more a
&ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; than anything else&mdash;but it does provide much
more functionality in fewer lines of code than would be required by
an equivalent program written in C.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1a7a850"></a>Endian Wars</h2></div></div><p>The big vs. little endian debate has been the topic of many
flame wars on the Internet. But what is it? Big and little endian
refers to the order of bytes. When moving data around, some systems
start with the most significant byte (MSB) and some start with the
least significant byte (LSB). Imagine an array of 4 bytes. How do
you store or send this array? Would you start at the LSB (little
endian) or would you start at the MSB (big endian)? Some hardware
does it one way, and some does it the other. Why do we care? If you
are writing a client and server in C to run on the same type of
hardware, the endian problem doesn't pop up. But if you are using a
different language, like Java, to talk to a server written in C,
there could be a big problem. Endian problems crop up only when
multiple byte data types like integers are sent across the network.
Java automatically converts its data to and from network byte order
when it sends data through a socket. C, on the other hand, does
only as it is told. There are two C system calls,
<b  >ntohl()</b> and <b  >htonl()</b>, which
convert data to and from network byte order. Read the man pages for
these calls and use them in your C-based servers and clients to
avoid endian problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1a7aa08"></a>Java and Security</h2></div></div><p>Java has some strict security restrictions. An applet can
only open a socket to the server on which it was loaded.
Applications, on the other hand, are allowed to open sockets to any
machine. My client is written as a stand-alone application for this
reason. (I don't have access to a web server that will allow me to
run my CB server.) There are very few major differences between an
<b  >applet</b> and an application. An applet extends the
class applet and an application extends the class
<b  >frame</b>. Refer to a book on Java for more specific
details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1a7abc0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This project was my first real attempt at client-server
programming. I'm hooked! With the basic server written, it is
possible to extend the code to do many things. I would like to
eventually redesign the user interface to make it look better and
be easier to use. Having Linux at home has made the program
development process much easier. I was able to use the same tools
on both my home system and the Sun workstations at school so a
simple recompilation was all that was necessary for the server to
run on a Sparc 5. My hope is that someone else will find this work
useful. No references could be found in any Java book (I have
three) to address this specific application. While client-server
applications were available in all of these books, all of the
servers were written in Java. Java works well for writing servers,
but is not as fast and requires more system resources to run. Every
language has its place and Java is no exception. Java is very
useful as a client programming language; it's here to stay.</p><p>Take a look at the listings:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a href="0155l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></li><li><p><a href="0155l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></li><li><p><a href="0155l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1588580.0x1a7b090"></a>References</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></span></p></li><li><p>David Flanagan (1996, O'Reilly &amp; Associates,
