<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #251, March 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nicolas Dichtel</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Thierry Herbelot</b></span> pointed out that the directories
in the <span   class="bold"><b>/proc</b></span> filesystem used a linked list to identify their files.
But, this would be slow when /proc directories started having lots of
files, which, for example, might happen when the system needed lots of
network sockets.
</p><p>
Nicolas and Thierry posted a patch to change the /proc implementation
to use multiple linked lists instead of just one. Each subdirectory
would have its own linked list, keyed to a hash of the directory's
name. According to their benchmarks, the patch shaved 1/5 of the time
needed to churn through all the entries of a given subdirectory.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephen Hemminger</b></span> liked the speedup, but suggested that there 
already were implementations, like the <span   class="bold"><b>hlist
macro</b></span>, that might simplify
their hash table code.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric W. Biederman</b></span> also liked the speedup and kicked himself for
overlooking the /proc issue when doing other scalability work. But, he
felt that the whole linked list concept was not the right approach.
Especially, he felt that /proc/net/dev/snmp6 was the real target of
Nicolas and Thierry's patch, and if no one actually needed the files
in that directory (except people requiring extreme backward
compatibility), it would be even more efficient to do away with them
completely.
</p><p>
This, however, already had come up in an earlier thread, when <span   class="bold"><b>David S.
Miller</b></span> had said that &ldquo;It potentially breaks tools, it's a
non-starter, sorry.&rdquo; So, reworking the user interface would not be
allowed, which left the linked list speedup that Nicolas and Thierry
proposed. But, Nicolas said he'd look into an <span   class="bold"><b>rbtree</b></span> implementation
instead of a plain linked list, because rbtrees would potentially scale
better.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Minchan Kim</b></span> noticed that putting memory
pressure on <span   class="bold"><b>qemu-kvm</b></span> under
Linux 3.14 would cause a kernel stack overflow and crash the system.
He dug into the code and tried to reduce his own stack usage, but he
wasn't able to cut back enough to prevent the crash. And in any case,
he said, trying to reduce everyone's stack usage was not very
scalable. He proposed expanding the kernel stack from 8K to 16K,
although he acknowledged that there possibly were good reasons not to do
this that he wasn't aware of.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Chinner</b></span> remarked that &ldquo;8k stacks were never large enough to fit
the Linux IO architecture on x86-64, but nobody outside filesystem and
IO developers has been willing to accept that argument as valid,
despite regular stack overruns and filesystems having to add workaround
after workaround to prevent stack overruns.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He added, &ldquo;We're basically at the point where we have to push every
XFS operation that requires block allocation off to another thread to
get enough stack space for normal operation&rdquo;, and said &ldquo;XFS has always
been the stack usage canary and this issue is basically a repeat of
the 4k stack on i386 kernel debacle.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Borislav Petkov</b></span> pointed out that if they increased the kernel stack
from 8K to 16K, there undoubtedly would come a time when 16K wouldn't
be enough either. He wondered if there ever would be a limit, or if
the kernel stack ultimately would grow to one megabyte and beyond.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Steven Rostedt</b></span> said, &ldquo;If [Minchan's patch] goes in, it should be a
config option, or perhaps selected by those filesystems that need it.
I hate to have 16K stacks on a box that doesn't have that much memory,
but also just uses ext2.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Meanwhile, <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> said, &ldquo;8K additional per thread is a huge
hit. XFS has indeed always been a canary, or trouble spot, I suspect
because it originally came from another kernel where this was not an
optimization target.&rdquo;
</p><p>
At around this point, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> remarked that something like
Minchan's fix probably would be necessary at some point, although the
development cycle was already at -rc7, making it too late for that
particular kernel version. Linus also pointed out that there was
plenty of room to reduce stack usage in the stack trace Minchan had
posted in his original e-mail. Linus remarked, &ldquo;From a quick glance at
the frame usage, some of it seems to be gcc being rather bad at stack
allocation, but lots of it is just nasty spilling around the
disgusting call-sites with tons or arguments. A <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of the stack
slots are marked as '%sfp' (which is gcc-ese for 'spill frame
pointer', afaik).&rdquo;
</p><p>
There was a technical discussion about various ways to reduce stack
usage in general (and some further consideration of ways in which GCC
might be somewhat to blame), but with Linus willing to accept a patch
to implement a larger stack, it seems like something along the lines
of Minchan's patch will soon be part of the kernel. At one point, Linus
summed up his position on the issue, saying, &ldquo;Minchan's call trace and
this thread has actually convinced me that yes, we really do need to
make x86-64 have a 16kB stack. [...] The 8kB stack has been somewhat
restrictive and painful for a while, and I'm ok with admitting that it
is just getting <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> damn painful.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Bluetooth Auto Connect</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #251, March 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love my latest Android device (see this issue's Open-Source Classroom
column for details), but for some reason, it won't automatically connect
to my Bluetooth headset. When I turn on my headset, I want it to connect
to my Android device so I can start using it right away. In order to
make it connect, I have to go into the settings app, then Bluetooth,
and then tap the device to connect. Thankfully, there's an application
that makes life a lot easier.
</p><p>
Bluetooth Auto Connect is a program that runs in the background. It
doesn't constantly poll for newly turned on Bluetooth devices, because
that would waste battery power. It has several other ways to initiate
the connection though. My favorite is the &ldquo;connect when powered
on&rdquo;
option. Because I always have to turn the phone on in order to start my
audiobook (or music), it's not an inconvenience to turn the screen on
in order to connect Bluetooth. As soon as the power button is pressed,
it connects to my headset, and by the time I open the media player
application, it's ready to rock!
</p><p>
Sometimes it's the simplest applications that are
the most useful. Bluetooth Auto Connect is one of
those. Check it out in the Google Play Store today:

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: MenuMeters</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #251, March 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It sounds like a &ldquo;back in my day&rdquo; story, but I really do miss the days
when laptops had LED activity lights for hard drives and Wi-Fi. Sure,
some still have them, but for the most part, the latest trend is to have
no way of knowing if your application is pegging the CPU at 100%, or if
it just locked up.
</p><p>
The hardware on Apple-branded laptops is amazing. Even if you hate the
operating system, the solid aluminum cases are just awesome. Like most
other brands of laptops, however, they lack any activity lights. A
perfect fix for OS X is the open-source MenuMeters application. It
puts all sorts of monitoring ability right in your menu bar. MenuMeters
supports CPU activity, network activity and even memory usage. With
a wide range of display options, you can customize MenuMeters to be as
informative or subtle as you like.

<h2 class="title">Solving ODEs on Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #251, March 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many problems in science and engineering are modeled through ordinary
differential equations (ODEs,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation</a>). An ODE is an equation that contains a
function of one independent variable and its derivatives. This means
that practically any system that changes over time can be modeled
with an ODE, from celestial mechanics to chemistry reaction rates to
ecology and population modeling. 
</p><p>
Because of this ubiquity, many tools
have been developed through the years to help solve and analyze ODEs. In
this article,
I take a look at one of the tools available on Linux: Model
Builder (<a href="http://model-builder.sourceforge.net" target="_self">model-builder.sourceforge.net</a>). The project
is hosted on SourceForge, so you always can build it
from source, but most distributions should have a package available. On
Debian-based distros, you can install it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install model-builder
</pre>
</p><p>
It also installs several Python modules to support the tasks it can
handle. If you do decide to build from source, you will need to handle
these dependencies yourself. 
</p><p>
Included with the source is a directory of
examples. You can use them as a starting point and to gain some ideas
of what you can do with Model Builder. Documentation is a bit sparse,
so you may need to get your hands a little dirty to take the most
advantage of what is possible with Model Builder.
</p><p>
To start Model Builder, you either can click on its menu item in your
desktop environment or run the command <tt  >PyMB</tt> from a terminal
window. When the main window pops up, you are presented with a template
where you can define the problem you are analyzing (Figure 1). The main
pane, titled Differential Equations, is where you can define the set
of ordinary differential equations that you are trying to solve. The
general form of these equations is dy/dt = f(y,t).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825modelf1.large.jpg"><img src="11825modelf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When Model Builder starts, you can set several parameters and the
equations you want to analyze.
</p></div></div><p>
If your system depends on different levels of differentiating the
dependent variable, you always can rewrite it as a system of ODEs. When
you give Model Builder your system, you need to write out only the
right-hand side of the above equation. This equation can contain
essentially any function or expression that NumPy understands, since
Model Builder uses Python to do the heavy lifting. 
</p><p>
Because Model Builder
is designed to handle systems of equations, you need to define the y
portion as elements of a list. So the y variable for the first equation
is labeled as y[0]; the y variable for the second equation is labeled
y[1] and so on. These are called the state variables. 
</p><p>
The pane to
the right of the equation window is where you can place any parameters
that you need, one per line. They can be used in the equation window,
where they are labeled as p[0], p[1] and so on. If you want to use time in
either the parameters or equations that you have defined, you just need
to use the t variable. 
</p><p>
Because Python is used in the back end, you 
even can use lambda functions to define more complex structures. You may
want to take a look at the documentation available on the NumPy site to
see what options are available (<a href="http://www.numpy.org" target="_self">www.numpy.org</a>).
</p><p>
Below these two panes is where you define the rest of the options for your
problem. In the Initial values box, you can enter the initial values
for each state variable at the time t=0. They need to be separated with
a space and put in the order of the equations given in the equation
pane. 
</p><p>
Below the Initial values, you can enter the start time, the end
time and the time step to use in the solution. The critical time steps
box is usually left empty, so let's leave it alone here. The first
step box is the size of the first step. Usually, you should leave this
as 0 to allow for automatic determination. The minimum and maximum
step size boxes set these variables that are used in the variable step
size algorithm. Typically, you should leave these as 0 as well to allow for
automatic determination. 
The full output check box will print out more
useful information about the integration in the results spreadsheet. 
</p><p>
Once
everything is entered, all you need to do is click the Start icon, and
the integration will be calculated. If this is a system that you will
want to work with over time, you can click on the menu item File&rarr;Save
to save the model to a file. This file format is an XML file, so you could
edit it with a text editor if you want. When you are ready to do more
work with it, you can load it by clicking on File&rarr;Open.
</p><p>
Once the calculations are done, which may be fast for simple problems,
a results window will pop up (Figure 2). matplotlib handles this graph
window,
so you can manipulate it just like any other matplotlib
window. This includes panning, zooming or changing the plot window. You
also can save the resulting plot as an image file in one of several
different formats. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825modelf2.large.jpg"><img src="11825modelf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Once you finish defining the problem and run the integration, a
result window pops up with a graph of the integration.
</p></div></div><p>
Going back to the main window, let's look at some other available
tools. Clicking on the Show equations icon pops up a
window where you can see the equations typeset (Figure 3). Beside this
icon is the Results icon. Clicking on that pops up a spreadsheet
of all of the results from your integration (Figure 4). The columns of
data include the time, the value of y[0] and the step sizes, among
other things. You can select a couple columns by holding down the Ctrl
key and clicking on the column headers. Then, click on the plot
button to plot them in a new window. You can get a power spectrum for
any one column by selecting one of interest and clicking on the
Spectrum icon. This pops up two new windows, the first a power
spectrum of the column (Figure 5) and the second a spectrogram of the
column (Figure 6). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825modelf3.large.jpg"><img src="11825modelf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You always can get a typeset display of your equations to verify
what they should look like.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825modelf4.large.jpg"><img src="11825modelf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can pull up all of the results of your integration and do
further analysis.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825modelf5.large.jpg"><img src="11825modelf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can generate a power spectrum of any column of your results.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825modelf6.large.jpg"><img src="11825modelf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You also can generate a spectrogram of your results.
</p></div></div><p>
The last tool available is a wavelet transform. When
you select a column, you can apply a continuous wavelet transform to the
data. When you are done with Model Builder, you can save this data
into a comma-separated values (CSV) file from the spreadsheet window. Then,
you can import it into other tools, like R, to do even further analysis.
</p><p>
Now that you have seen the options available in Model Builder, hopefully
you will consider it when looking at ODE problems. It provides a pretty
simple interface to the tools available in Python to solve
ODEs numerically. Although other more powerful tools are available, Model Builder
fits into the niche of experimenting quickly with different equations
and playing with ideas.

<h2 class="title">Nmap&mdash;Not Just for Evil!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #251, March 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If SSH is the Swiss Army knife of the system administration world, Nmap
is a box of dynamite. It's really easy to misuse dynamite and blow your
foot off, but it's also a very powerful tool that can do jobs that
are impossible without it.
</p><p>
When most people think of Nmap, they think of scanning servers, looking
for open ports to attack. Through the years, however, that same ability is
incredibly useful when you're in charge of the server or computer in
question. Whether you're trying to figure out what kind of server is
using a specific IP address in your network or trying to lock
down a new NAS device, scanning networks is incredibly useful.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows a network scan of my QNAP NAS. The only thing I use the
unit for is NFS and SMB file sharing, but as you can tell, it has a ton
of ports wide open. Without Nmap, it would be difficult to figure out
what the machine was running.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11825nmapf1.large.jpg"><img src="11825nmapf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Network Scan
</p></div></div><p>
Another incredibly useful way to use Nmap is to scan a network. You don't
even have to have root access for that, and it's as simple as specifying
the network block you want to scan. For example, typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
</pre>
</p><p>
will scan the entire range of 254 possible IP addresses on my local
network and let me know which are pingable, along with which ports are
open. If you've just plugged in a new piece of hardware, but don't know
what IP address it grabbed via DHCP, Nmap is priceless. For example,
the above command revealed this on my network:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Nmap scan report for 
 &#8618;TIVO-8480001903CCDDB.brainofshawn.com (192.168.1.220)
Host is up (0.0083s latency).
Not shown: 995 filtered ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
80/tcp   open   http
443/tcp  open   https
2190/tcp open   tivoconnect
2191/tcp open   tvbus
9080/tcp closed glrpc
</pre>
</p><p>
This not only tells me the address of my new Tivo unit, but it also
shows me what ports it has open. Thanks to its reliability, usability
and borderline black hat abilities, Nmap gets this month's Editors'
Choice award. It's not a new program, but if you're a Linux user, you
should be using it!

<h2 class="title">Tighten Up SSH</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #251, March 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
SSH is a Swiss Army knife and Hogwart's magic wand all rolled into one
simple command-line tool. As often as we use it, we sometimes forget that
even our encrypted friend can be secured more than it is by default. For
a full list of options to turn on and off, simply type <tt  >man
sshd_config</tt>
to read the man page for the configuration file.
</p><p>
As an example, one of the first things I do is disable root login
via SSH. If you open /etc/ssh/sshd_config as root, search for a line
mentioning <tt  >PermitRootLogin</tt> and change it to
<tt  >no</tt>. If you can't find
a line with that option, just add it to the end. It will end up looking
like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PermitRootLogin no
</pre>
</p><p>
Plenty of other security options are available as well. Disabling
the old SSH version 1 protocol is as simple as changing (or adding):

<pre     class="programlisting">
Protocol 2, 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Change it to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Protocol 2
</pre>
</p><p>
Then only the far more secure version 2 protocol will be able to
connect. Every server situation has different security needs. Reading
through the man page might reveal some options you never even considered
before. (Note that the sshd d&aelig;mon will need to be restarted for the
changes to be applied. Or, if in doubt, just reboot the computer.)
