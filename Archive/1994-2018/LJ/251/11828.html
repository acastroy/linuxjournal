What's better than a pocket-sized Android tablet? One for $20.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf40358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For reasons other than &ldquo;which do you like better&rdquo;, my cell phone is
an Apple iPhone. Mainly it's because the rest of my family members use Apple
products, and I want to be able to fit into their environment. With three
teenage daughters, it's nice to run &ldquo;Find my iPhone&rdquo; and see why they're
running late. That leaves me with two problems. First, there's the ridicule and
teasing from my geeky friends. (You know who you are!) The second problem
is that I really love Android apps for much of what I do on a day-to-day basis. My Nexus 7 is too unwieldy to carry around all the time, so
I really need a tiny little Android tablet I can keep in my pocket. If
the roles were flipped, I could just buy an iPod Touch and be done with
it. It turns out things aren't so simple in the Android world.
</p><p>
I was able to find the Samsung Galaxy Player in several sizes, but not
only did they cost hundreds of dollars, they also were discontinued
before I ever could order one. It seems my demographic is tiny enough
that it can't support a line of devices. Thankfully, my demographic is
also pretty nerdy, so with a little research and hard work, I got a
better solution altogether&mdash;for $20.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf40618"></a>
My Prepaid Non-Phone</h2></div></div><p>
The short version is that I bought a prepaid Android phone and never
activated it. That version of the story leaves out some really important
and really cool details, however. My end result is a pocket-sized Android
device that I can use for listening to audiobooks via Bluetooth headset,
make and receive calls, play games, and sorta use for a GPS device while
driving. The best part is that my uber-micro-tablet really did cost me
only $20.
</p><p>
If you're lazy, you can just buy a prepaid phone off the shelf and
never activate it. Most (but not all) will allow you to cancel the
activation screen and use the device without cell service. If you do
some research and don't mind a little hard work, however, you can get
a cheap Android device that does everything you want without any nag
screens or limitations. I describe my process here, and if it
sounds like something interesting, you can do the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf407d0"></a>
My Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
I wanted my new anti-iPod to be every bit as useful as the Samsung Galaxy
Player would have been. Here's what I expected:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A small but nice quality screen: I didn't want a cheap plastic screen
that would haze over with tiny scratches. Preferably, I wanted Gorilla
Glass.
</p></li><li><p>
Wi-Fi: this seems obvious, but with cheap prepaid phones, you 
never can tell. It's always safest to make sure!
</p></li><li><p>
At least a dual-core CPU: I didn't want a powerhouse, but I wanted to
be able to <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> things with the device. I wanted at least 2GB of RAM as
well, but I ended up settling for 1GB.
</p></li><li><p>
MicroSD expansion slot: this is vitally important, because prepaid
phones generally come with absurdly small amounts of internal storage.
</p></li><li><p>
Bluetooth: the main purpose of this device will be to listen to
audiobooks. For that, it needs to work with my knockoff-brand version
of the Logitech HB-730.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Must be rootable</em></span>: this is as important as the MicroSD slot. With the
advent of Android 4.4, you need to have a rooted device in order for
applications to be able to write to the SD card. I personally think
it's about the dumbest &ldquo;feature&rdquo; a new version of Android could offer,
but at least with root access, it can be fixed.
</p></li><li><p>
Must be affordable. I already have a phone (the iPhone), so I have
to be able to convince my wife that it's not wasteful to buy a prepaid
phone I never plan to activate. Happy wife = happy life!
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf40f08"></a>
My New Non-Phone</h2></div></div><p>
I spent a very, very long time researching what phone to purchase. Since
what I was proposing goes against everything the prepaid vendors stand
for, it's not like I could check their Web sites to see if the phones
were rootable or if they'd work without activation. I considered several
models:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Motorola Moto G from Verizon and Boost Mobile:
the Moto G is a pretty decent-looking phone, and it has a beautiful
screen. Unfortunately, although it has 8GB of onboard storage, it lacks
a MicroSD expansion slot. It's also around $80, which is reasonable
considering how nice of a device it is, but without that SD slot, it's
more than I was willing to pay.
</p></li><li><p>
LG Volt from Boost Mobile:
this phone is probably what I'd buy if I were going to buy another device
right now. It checks all the boxes above, and it has really great battery
life along with really great cameras. You currently can pick up this device
for around $60, and for the hardware you get, I'm guessing Boost is
losing some money on every sale.
</p></li><li><p>
LG Realm from Boost Mobile:
the Realm is what I ended up buying (Figure 1). The specs are a step
down from the Volt, but I was able to get the device for $19.99 from
Best Buy at the end of 2014 in the &ldquo;last chance to get Black Friday
Sale Prices&rdquo; sale. That sale probably still is running; it seems that's
how Black Friday sales work nowadays.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11828f1.large.jpg"><img src="11828f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Oddly, a replacement battery for this phone costs more than 
the phone itself. At $19.99, you can't go wrong!
</p></div></div><p>
Phone models change all the time. Rather than make decisions based on my findings from
a few months ago, I urge you to look for the latest and greatest (or
cheapest!) prepaid options out there, and make sure they meet your list of
requirements. I can't stress enough how important it is for the phone to
be rootable though, so do at least that much research before buying one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf414e0"></a>
The Rooting</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes the hardest part of the process is to get out of the &ldquo;ACTIVATE
ME NOW&rdquo; screen. With enough button pressing, I was able to put the
activation screen in the background. Every time the phone booted, however,
it had the same annoying screen trying to force me to activate. Therefore,
the very first thing I recommend doing is rooting the phone.
</p><p>
Usually, that's as simple as visiting <a href="http://towelroot.com" target="_self">towelroot.com</a> from the
phone's browser and installing the tr.apk file. As long as your phone
is supported, it's literally 2&ndash;3 clicks, and your phone is rooted. Then
install SuperSU from the Google Play store, and your phone is ready
to hack.
</p><p>
It's important to note that rooting a phone is not the same as installing
a third-party ROM. Although it's dead simple to root most phones, installing
something like Cyanogenmod is far more difficult, and often it's not possible
even if the phone is rooted. Thankfully, once the phone is rooted, the
existing ROM can be made to function a little nicer. Getting rid of the
nag screens is the first obstacle in that journey.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf417a0"></a>
Stop the Nags!</h2></div></div><p>
Once your phone is rooted, it's time to start looking for the applications
that are doing all the nagging. Unfortunately, this will take some
googling, some guessing and a little bit of luck. The process is itself
pretty straightforward:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Download a root-enabled file manager app like Root Browser or
something similar.
</p></li><li><p>
Figure out what app(s) are responsible for the activation nag
screens. Basically, google your phone's model along with &ldquo;disable
activation screen&rdquo; or something like that.
</p></li><li><p>
Rename the apk files to add .bak at the end. In my case, I had to
rename /system/app/LGDMSClient.apk to /system/app/LGDMSClient.apk.bak.
</p></li><li><p>
Reboot the phone and see if it worked. If it did, celebrate. If not,
do some more googling, or just educated guessing, and try again. There
is some danger here, but as long as you're not deleting files, just
renaming them, most bad guesses can be reversed.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0xf41c18"></a>
Other Anti-iPod Tweaks</h2></div></div><p>
Once your phone is working, and you're able to reboot it without the
frustrating nag screens, head over to the settings app. Here is where you
can disable all cellular data radios. Since you're not going to activate
the phone with cell service, it will save some serious battery power if
you disable the radios entirely. Depending on your model, you may have
to disable 4G/LTE and 3G separately.
</p><p>
The one frustration I have is that try as I might, I've not been able to
remove the cellular radio icon from the top of the phone (Figure
2). There are some apps in the Google Play store to remove icons, but
they remove the Wi-Fi icon too, and that doesn't help me at all. Oh well,
it's a small price to pay. Plus, it's a great way for me to keep track of
Sprint coverage in my area. If it ever gets strong enough, I'll probably
invest in a Karma router (<a href="http://www.yourkarma.com" target="_self">www.yourkarma.com</a>), which would make my new
mini-tablet even more useful on the road.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11828f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Although the cellular radio icon bothers me, it's the only
frustration I haven't been able to eliminate!
</p></div></div><p>
One last recommendation I have is to download one of the &ldquo;SD
Fix&rdquo;
apps from the Google Play store. With the advent of Android 4.4, the
SD card isn't writable by apps like FolderSync, and as such, it makes
managing audiobooks or MP3 files really difficult. With a rooted phone,
it's another two-click solution to make your SD card functional again. I
still can't believe Google crippled Android 4.4 like that. Thankfully,
root access and Linux can save the day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0x133a2e0"></a>
Here's My Number, Call Me Maybe</h2></div></div><p>
If the cell radio icon bothers me, just imagine how much it bothers me to
have a phone with microphone and speaker, but no phone service. I know,
I said I wasn't looking for a phone, but I have OCD, so that unused
hardware really annoys me.
Enter SIP.
</p><p>
Some phones come with a firmware that supports Android SIP calling out
of the box. Most prepaid phones, however, disable that feature because
they want you to use their service. It makes sense. Thankfully, you
can download a third-party app called CSipSimple and add complete Wi-Fi-based
SIP calling to your phone. It even integrates with the native dialer
application, so you use it like a regular phone! I'm still using Google
Voice service through <a href="http://www.simonics.com" target="_self">www.simonics.com</a>, but because that ability was
supposed to stop almost a year ago, I wouldn't count on it working
forever. Any SIP provider will work with CSipSimple, however, so even
if the free Google Voice option through Simonics stops working, you can
get the prepaid phone working without paying the cellular provider.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0x133a498"></a>
GPS!</h2></div></div><p>
It's hard to buy an Android device that doesn't come with GPS built
in. Although the lack of cellular radio means you can't do real-time map
downloading on the road (unless you have mobile Wi-Fi or a hotspot on your
actual cell phone), it's simple to use your new mini-tablet as a GPS device
with a little bit of planning. Google Maps allows you to download map
data for specific areas locally to the device. This doesn't work great
for long trips, because grabbing all those &ldquo;map sections&rdquo; is tedious,
but for short trips to unknown locations it works well.
</p><p>
There are also several off-line GPS apps available in the Google Play
store, and although most cost money, they're cheaper than buying a standalone
GPS unit at the store. If I'm being completely honest, I still use a
Garmin GPS for long trips, but that's probably because I'm old and
don't always trust technology to work as expected.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe48580.0x133a650"></a>
What Else?</h2></div></div><p>
For me, having a tiny Android device that lets me sync audiobooks
with FolderSync and play with the Listen app is all I could want and
more. That doesn't mean I couldn't think of more things to do with a
cheap Android device, however. I actually bought another LG Realm when
they were on sale, and I have lots of plans for it&mdash;things like:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A Plex player for watching movies.
</p></li><li><p>
A really cheap IP camera (birdcam!) using the IPWebcam app.
</p></li><li><p>
Music player for the bathroom counter, connected to speakers.
</p></li><li><p>
Tiny gaming device for bored children who visit.
</p></li><li><p>
Cheap Skype/Hangout device to give someone I want to keep in contact with.
</p></li><li><p>
Surprisingly affordable alarm clock for my nightstand.
</p></li><li><p>
Universal XBMC/Kodi remote for all our televisions.
</p></li><li><p>
Wi-Fi testing tool (WiFi Analyzer).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Really, I'd do anything you can do with any other Android device, but without
the guilt of spending a ton of money. Having a $20 Android device
capable of doing so many things really makes it easy to come up with fun
projects. It's also nice to be able to mount one in the car and just
leave it there. With FolderSync, it will download any new media when
you're parked in the garage, and you'll never have to take your phone
out of your pocket!
</p><p>
I'm really quite happy Samsung discontinued its Galaxy Player
devices. I worry that if they were available, I might have purchased
one. I'm so much happier with my $20 tablet than I would have been with
a $300 media player. If you have a need for another Android device in
your life, but don't want to spend a fortune, I urge you to check out
the prepaid phone options out there. It's surprising what $20 
will buy!
