DivvyCloud Platform for VMware Cloud on AWS</h2></div></div><p>
DivvyCloud's unique niche in the IT ecosystem is helping organizations
automate and manage their multi-cloud infrastructure at scale. The
latest innovation from the company is the DivvyCloud Platform for
VMware Cloud on AWS, a solution enabling consistent policy enforcement
and automation of cloud best practices to customers of VMware Cloud
on Amazon Web Services (AWS). VMware Cloud on AWS unites VMware's
enterprise-class Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) software together
with the elastic, bare-metal infrastructure from AWS, which results in
a consistent operating model and application mobility for the private
and public cloud. DivvyCloud maintains that its software is unique in
the marketplace, due to its ability to track real-time changes across
clouds and take customer-defined, autonomous action to fix problems and
ensure policy compliance. Standard automation bots proactively address
myriad security, cost and compliance challenges commonly faced by any
organization adopting or expanding cloud-based infrastructure. The
visibility and policy automation afforded by the DivvyCloud solution
remediate security, cost and compliance issues, adds the firm.

Zentera Systems, Inc.'s CoIP Security Enclave</h2></div></div><p>
On the heels of being crowned &ldquo;Cool Vendor in Cloud Security&rdquo; by
Gartner, Zentera Systems, Inc., announced an upgrade to its flagship
CoIP Security Enclave solution. The solution enables enterprises to
specify their micro-segmentation policies, which the Enclave software
automatically converts into application-aware segmentation rules that
protect application workloads in unified virtual overlay networks
called &ldquo;enclaves&rdquo;. Those workloads can be running anywhere,
including on-premises and across any cloud, hybrid and multicloud
environments. This new release extends the flagship application with CoIP
Smart Discovery capability, which self-scrutinizes workload behavior
to uncover existing application compute flows and behavior. Based on
this intel, enterprise IT security teams then can complete
micro-segmentation definitions and find any potential gaps in their
segmentation implementation quickly. Such intelligent automation saves teams
considerable time and effort, especially in a hybrid environment where
numerous applications and workloads are combined. The Smart Discovery
functionality is fully integrated with CoIP Application Interlock,
an existing security capability that allows companies to specify which
authorized applications in a specific CoIP enclave are allowed to access
the enclave's network. All other applications are locked out, greatly
enhancing enclave security. With CoIP Secure Enclave, says Zentera,
a hybrid or cloud environment is no different from on-premises, and
enterprises maintain complete control over connectivity and security to
implement one unified security policy across all environments.

IBM's LinuxONE Enterprise System</h2></div></div><p>
Plentiful new capabilities are to be found in the newly unveiled next
generation of the IBM LinuxONE Enterprise System, which Big Blue describes
as &ldquo;the industry's most advanced enterprise Linux platform&rdquo;. The new
system provides capabilities that will boost the security
of popular open-source-based container technologies like Docker and
Kubernetes significantly, thanks to IBM Secure Service Container technology running
on LinuxONE. Applications running in a container solution take on the
security capabilities of Secure Service Container without any change to
the software. These new features remove the burden of building security
into applications, allowing developers to spend their time innovating
instead. IBM LinuxONE Secure Service Containers provide applications
significant protection against external and insider threats, including
automatic encryption of data in-flight and at-rest, and tamper-resistance
during installation and runtime. Also new to the platform is the 
LinuxONE Emperor II, based on IBM Z mainframe technology and featuring
the industry's fastest microprocessor, running at 5.2GHz, and a highly
engineered, scalable system structure. LinuxONE Emperor II can support
the following: a 17TB MongoDB Enterprise instance in a single system with
up to 10x better read/write latency than an x86-based implementation;
certified infrastructure for Docker EE with integrated management
and scale tested up to two million containers; vertical scale to 170
cores and industry-leading performance for Java workloads; integrated
pause-less garbage collection and up to 2.6x better performance than
x86 alternatives.

vCISO Services, LLC's CISO as a Service</h2></div></div><p>
The bad guys know about and are exploiting the growing rift between
the security officer &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;. They target smaller
businesses because they know that their information security programs
are not as strong as the big companies' are. To level the playing
field, vCISO Services, LLC, has begun offering CISO as a Service (CaaS)
products, cost-effective packages of part-time, seasoned executive
information-security expertise to organizations that lack the capacity
to staff a full-time Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). These
packages include blocks of ongoing virtual CISO time or on a targeted
project basis. Because vCISO Services operates nearly 100% virtually,
it saves businesses money by not passing on travel and other related
face-to-face costs. The company typically reserves the on-site
activities for when it matters most, such as interacting with auditors
or presenting to the board of directors. The firm specializes in the
executive components of information security management, such as risk
assessments, policy and standard creation, vendor reviews, regulatory
gap analysis and general interim and ongoing CISO activities.

Attala Systems' Composable Storage Infrastructure</h2></div></div><p>
Upon its exit from stealth mode, Attala Systems revealed news of its
new high-performance Composable Storage Infrastructure product. Attala
Systems' NVMe over Fabric (NVMe-oF) solution product utilizes Intel
FPGAs and NVMe Flash storage to provide &ldquo;breakthrough
performance&rdquo; for
its target customers, including cloud-service providers, e-commerce
sites, managed-service providers, telco providers, financial
services and real-time digital enterprises. The Attala Composable
Storage Infrastructure, according to its creator, marks the start of
a significant change in how storage is used for cloud and real-time
analytics. Attala's FPGA-based fabric delivers advances in predictable
storage latency, IOPS, agility and cost efficiency. With the complement
of Attala's SPARA automation and management software, the result is
a storage system with high and predictable performance and extremely
simple management. The product utilizes a scale-out fabric running on
standard 25, 40 or 50Gb/sec Ethernet to interconnect a data center's
servers and data nodes. By eliminating legacy storage management layers,
the Composable Storage Infrastructure product provides more than ten million
IOPS per scale-out node and latencies as low as 16 microseconds at a
per-gigabyte price lower than competitive solutions. The result is an
adaptable storage infrastructure that is essentially an elastic block
storage (EBS) solution &ldquo;on steroids&rdquo;, adds Attala.
