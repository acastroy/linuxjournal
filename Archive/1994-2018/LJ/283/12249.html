<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #283, November 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Salvatore Mesoraca</b></span> recently posted a patch to make it harder for
hostile users to trick regular users into putting sensitive data into
files and pipes controlled by the attacker. The problem was that 
attackers could create a file, or a FIFO (first in/first out) pipe,
that had a filename expected by one of the regular pieces of software
on the system. Regular users then innocently would use the regular
piece of software, thinking they safely could input a password or
whatever, but instead of creating the safe and private file on the
filesystem, the regular software mistakenly would open the attacker's
file or FIFO instead and send the sensitive data right into the
attacker's hands.
</p><p>
The solution, as Salvatore saw it, was to tighten the system's
controls over directory permissions. Salvatore's patch would affect
directories that had been set world-writeable, with the sticky bit set,
such that the regular user, and the regular software, would not have
permission to edit the hostile files and FIFOs created by the
attacker. Instead, the software simply would fail to create the file
it needed. This might result in users being unable to use the
software until the hostile file had been identified and removed, but
at least the attack would have been foiled.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kees Cook</b></span> was thrilled to see this particular security hole plugged.
He had a couple coding suggestions and also suggested documenting
an example attack that Salvatore's patch would stop.
</p><p>
But, <span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Peslyak</b></span> replied, &ldquo;I doubt there are (m)any examples of
attacks and blog posts on this, because most systems didn't have
similar (sym)link restrictions until recently and those attacks are
simpler.&rdquo; He pointed out that symbolic links also were susceptible to
this sort of attack, and he advocated making /tmp, /dev/shm and other
potential target directories entirely unwriteable except via known
library interfaces.
</p><p>
By way of advocating for Salvatore's patch, Alexander also added,
&ldquo;policy enforcement like this implemented in a kernel module helped me
find weaknesses in an old Postfix privsep implementation, which were
promptly patched (that was many years ago). Having this generally
available and easy to enable could result in more findings like this
by more people.&rdquo;
</p><p>
One of the things that's good about Linux is that security fixes are
treated like holy Silmarils. They even supersede <span   class="bold"><b>ABI</b></span> preservation in
the importance given them by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> and others. Now that Linux
systems are being targeted more seriously by government hackers around
the world, it's all the more important to fix problems as they appear
and to make no exceptions. I personally find it mind-boggling that
anyone is still advocating putting &ldquo;official&rdquo; back doors into security
software, and that <span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft</b></span> still relies so much on anti-virus
software rather than closing the holes that allow attackers to get in
in the first place.
</p><p>
We don't usually get to see Linus taking the lead on a particular
kernel feature or fix. Usually he leaves that to the other
contributors, while he gives the final thumbs-up on whatever makes it
through the legions of reviewers and testers. The most notable time
when Linus really led a full project&mdash;aside from the kernel
itself&mdash;was when he created <span   class="bold"><b>Git</b></span>
entirely from scratch, after <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span>
failed, and no other revision control system was able to meet his
requirements.
</p><p>
But recently, Linus did take the reins on a lesser project. <span   class="bold"><b>Masahiro
Yamada</b></span> raised the question of whether it would be okay to have the
kernel build system require third-party tools like <span   class="bold"><b>Flex</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Bison</b></span>. The
current situation was to include files directly in the source tree
that already had been processed by those tools. That way, Linux could
avoid messy problems like versioning conflicts in the toolchain. But
Masahiro said that if it were possible to overcome those problems, it
would be useful to rely on real source files in the kernel source
tree, rather than these processed untouchable blobs of generated C
code.
</p><p>
Specifically, Masahiro had noticed that <span   class="bold"><b>kbuild</b></span> recently had added
rules for regenerating those files, so it already was possible to do.
But, he asked if it was therefore acceptable to do this all the time,
or only under certain key circumstances. And in fact, he asked if it
was possible to do away with the processed files altogether and
simply have the build system regenerate them as part of its default
behavior. As he put it, &ldquo;the advantage is we do not need to
version-control generated files, i.e. shipped files will be
deleted.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Linus took a look at the situation, and said, &ldquo;Yeah, I think we
probably should do that.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He did a test run and found that one of the files would be 
regenerated improperly because <span   class="bold"><b>gperf</b></span> changed its behavior in version 3.1. He
said, &ldquo;I'm not sure how to detect that automatically....gperf
doesn't seem to generate any version markers.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He worked around that particular problem by hand, only to run into a
similar problem elsewhere.
</p><p>
Linus said, &ldquo;one of the advantages of the pre-shipped files is that we
can avoid those kind of crazy version issues with the tools. But if we
can solve the versioning thing easily, I certainly don't mind getting
rid of the pre-generated files. Having to have flex/bison/gperf isn't
a huge onus on the kernel build system.&rdquo;
</p><p>
However, he also added the caveat, &ldquo;the traditional way to handle this
is autoconf, etc. Since I think autoconf is evil crap, I refuse to have
anything what-so-ever to do with it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He also felt that gperf was seriously misdesigned, because &ldquo;it would
have been trivial for them to add some kind of marker define so that
you could test for this directly rather than depend on some kind of
autoconf 'try to build and see if it fails' crap.&rdquo;
</p><p>
His solution was simply to ditch gperf altogether and make something
else that could do the same work. And he added, &ldquo;I assume that
flex/bison are stable enough that we don't have the same kind of
annoying stupid version issues with it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He posted a patch to get rid of the gperf dependency in the build
system and included many warnings that the code might be completely
broken, but just happened to work for him. He added, &ldquo;Honestly, the
code is better and more legible without gperf.&rdquo;
</p><p>
A couple weeks later, Masahiro noticed that Linus' patch had made it
into the kernel's git tree (surprise!), and he tested it out. He
reported that with <tt  >CONFIG_MODVERSIONS</tt> enabled, he saw a lot of error
messages.
</p><p>
Linus looked it over, but wasn't able to see the problem. He hadn't
used Modversions when he'd tested his patch, but said he'd take a look
and see if he could identify the problem.
</p><p>
In fact, after doing a <tt  >git clean -dqfx</tt>, he noticed a ton of warnings
that had slipped past his normal build test, but that clearly
were visible from a pristine build that regenerated various versioning
data.
</p><p>
Digging deeper, he was able to identify a one-line change in a
generated file that should not have happened. Apparently, it occurred
throughout the rest of the kernel build as well. He remarked:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
What is
special about that one particular function vs. the other ones in that
file? I have absolutely no idea. So the really odd thing here is how
things clearly still <span   class="emphasis"><em>work</em></span>. The parser works fine for everything
else. And looking at the gprof-removal patch it's not at all obvious
how everything could work fine except for some random thing. Strange.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
But after a little more digging, he reported, &ldquo;Found it. Stupid
special case for 'typeof()' that used is_reserved_word() in ways I
hadn't realized.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He put a fix into the Git tree.
</p><p>
So apparently, the kernel build system now will depend on tools like
Flex and Bison, and will regenerate its C files from those sources at
build time, rather than storing the regenerated files in the source
tree itself at development time.
</p><p>
It's hard to tell when Linus will dive into a particular problem and
work it out himself. I suspect he just found this to be a curious
diversion that happened to interest him at the time. In the case of
Git development, he resisted working on it for years, allowing kernel
development to depend on a non-free piece of software, tolerating many
flame wars along the way, allowing many competing projects to vie for
his attention, and ultimately choosing none of them. Although in that
instance, when he finally did decide to write Git, he actually put the
entire kernel project on hold for several weeks while he devoted
himself entirely to the new project.

<h2 class="title">Spyders for Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #283, November 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you want to do science with Anaconda, one of the first things to
consider is
the spyder package, which is included in the basic Anaconda installation. Spyder is
short for Scientific PYthon Development EnviRonment. 
Think of it as an IDE for scientific programming within Python. 
</p><p>
You 
probably will want to have the latest version available,
because it's under fairly constant development. You can be sure your
entire Anaconda installation is up to date with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
conda update anaconda
</pre>
</p><p>
There are two ways to launch spyder. If you're using the
Anaconda Navigator, you simply can click the spyder icon. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf1.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You can start spyder directly from the Anaconda Navigator.
</p></div></div><p>
If you have a terminal window open, you can launch spyder simply
typing <tt  >spyder</tt> and pressing enter. You may get a pop up window saying
that spyder is not the latest version. This is just because the version
within Anaconda is a few revisions behind.
</p><p>
Once you have spyder started, you should see an open editor window on
the left-hand side and a Python console window on the lower right-hand
side. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf2.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Starting up spyder gives you an empty editor window to
start your first project.
</p></div></div><p>
The upper right-hand side is used for a help browser,
a variable explorer and a file explorer. Like most IDEs, you can change
which panes are visible and their layout within the window. 
</p><p>
You can
begin working with spyder immediately in the console window. The
new default in spyder is to provide an IPython console that you can
use to interact with the Python engine directly. It works, essentially,
the same way that it works on the command line. The big difference is
that spyder can inspect the contents of the Python engine and can do
things like display variables and their contents within the variable
explorer. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf3.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can interact directly with the IPython console.
</p></div></div><p>
Although this is fine for smaller code snippets,
you'll likely end up working on much larger chunks of code. In that case,
you can use the editor to write functions and larger pieces. In order to
execute this Python code, you can click the green arrow
icon, click the menu item Run&rarr;Run or press the F5 key. Again, the
results are available from within the variable explorer. If instead you
click the blue arrow icon (or click on the menu item Debug&rarr;Debug),
your code will be run within the IPython debugger, which lets you step
through your code one line at a time. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf4.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Spyder includes a front end, allowing you to interact with ipdb,
the IPython debugger.
</p></div></div><p>
You can gain more
control over the debugging by adding breakpoints to your code. To do so,
double-click the left-hand gutter in the editor pane. You
should see a dot added for each breakpoint you insert.
</p><p>
Several tools are available for working on code and algorithm
quality. You'll probably want to start with a static code analysis.
Run it by clicking the &ldquo;Source&rarr;Run static code
analysis&rdquo; menu item or by pressing F8. This will run the analysis
and will provide the
results in a new pane that will pop up in the top right-hand pane.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf5.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can run a static code analysis to check for syntactic
errors.
</p></div></div><p>
The
results are categorized into convention breaks, refactoring suggestions,
syntax warnings and actual errors in your code. This will catch the
most obvious errors. 
</p><p>
Once you have code that actually works, the
next step is to check that code's performance. Spyder includes
a front end that gives you access to the profiler included in the
standard Python library. Start it by clicking the
Run&rarr;Profile menu item or by pressing F10. Once it finishes,
a new pane will appear in the same upper left-hand location.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf6.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. When you run the profiler, you'll get a display of how much
time is being used in each function.
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, the default profiler goes down only to the function
level, and that may not be fine enough in detail. If that's the case,
you can dive into one of the great features of spyder, its plugin
architecture. Several plugins are already included within
the Anaconda repository. Use the following command to install
the line profiler plugin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
conda install -c spyder-ide spyder-line-profiler
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can add the function decorator @profile to any functions that you
want to explore, and then start the line profiler by either clicking
the &ldquo;Run&rarr;Profile line by line&rdquo; menu item or by pressing
Shift-F10. You'll
then get the results in a new output pane. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf7.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can use the line profiler to see how efficient
functions are in more detail.
</p></div></div><p>
You can
look at how much time is spent on each line, both per hit and the total for
the complete program run. This way, you can focus on the most costly
parts of your code to get better performance.
</p><p>
Along with optimizing time, the other parameter you'll want to look
at optimizing is memory usage. This is becoming much more important as
more and more research is focusing on big data problems. In those cases,
you'll want to use the following command to install the memory profiler
plugin for spyder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
conda install -c spyder-ide spyder-memory-profiler
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the plugin is installed, you can add the decorator @profile just
as with the line profiler. Start the memory profiler by 
clicking &ldquo;Run&rarr;Profile memory line by line&rdquo; or by pressing
Ctrl-Shift-F10. Another pane will appear in the top right-hand
side where you can see how memory usage changes after each line
of code. This will allow you to figure out which lines of code are being
wasteful and where to focus your brain power for improving performance.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf8.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. There is a memory profiler plugin for spyder that allows
you to figure out how to optimize memory usage.
</p></div></div><p>
For scientific computing, the last item I want to look at is the ability
to visualize data. Humans often can make intuitive leaps by
being able to see how data looks. The default setting for spyder is
that graphs are drawn inline within the IPython console.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf9.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. By default, spyder allows you to generate plots within the
IPython console.
</p></div></div><p>
This is fine for a quick glance at the data, but it isn't the easiest to look
at. If you click Tools&rarr;Preferences, you'll see
a new window where you can change this behavior and have plots show
up in a different window instead.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf10.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. You can change the preferences on how plots are generated
and displayed.
</p></div></div><p>
If you rerun the code, you'll
now get the plot in a new window. This allows for
the ability to play with the plot display and even save off the final
image. If you change the settings around plotting in the preferences,
you may need to restart the IPython engine to pick up the new preferences.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249anaf11.large.jpg"><img src="12249anaf11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Generating plots in their own window allows for more
interaction.
</p></div></div><p>
And, that should be enough to get started using spyder in your
computational science problems. In my next article, I'll look at the version
of Jupyter that is included with Anaconda and see how it can be used
effectively. Both tools are good, but they fit within slightly different
ecological niches.

<h2 class="title">No Snooze for You!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #283, November 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I realized a while back that I've started setting my alarm an hour early
so I can snooze over and over before waking up. Intellectually, I know
that's silly, but there's just something fulfilling about hitting snooze
and snuggling back into bed. But since I end up losing an hour of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span>
sleep, I decided I needed a change. Change is hard, and so I opted for
an app to help me. Meet Alarmy.
</p><p>
Alarmy is an Android app that calls itself &ldquo;The World's Most Annoying
Alarm Clock App&rdquo;, and after using it, I think I agree. Like other apps
designed to make you actually wake up before snoozing, Alarmy supports
things like math problems that must be solved or violently shaking your
phone in order to turn off the alarm. But Alarmy doesn't stop there. The
most popular (and heinous) mode has you register a place in your home
that must be visited and photographed in order to stop the alarm.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12249androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
When you're fully awake, it's easy to figure out what sort of place makes
the most sense to register. The Alarmy folks recommend the bathroom sink,
but I personally recommend the coffee pot. If I trot out to the kitchen,
and take a photo of the coffee pot, you can bet I'm also going to make
a cup of coffee while I'm there. It's just too tempting. I'll probably
visit the bathroom while my Keurig brews a cup, but by that point,
I'm awake and craving coffee, so I'm unlikely to go back to bed.
</p><p>
Is it cruel? Yes. Does it work? Absolutely. Alarmy is free and
offers ad-elimination for a small fee. Ads usually don't bother
me in an app like this, but if I like an app, I usually pay for
it anyway to support the developer&mdash;in this case, the sadistic,
cruel developer! Check out Alarmy at the Google Play Store:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droom.sleepIfUCan" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=droom.sleepIfUCan</a>.
</p><p>
We have a sense of humor here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, so
thanks to Alarmy's
annoyingly wonderful way of forcing users to wake up, it gets this
month's Editors' Choice award (and also a bit of 
loathing, but we don't have an award for that).

<h2 class="title">Where Wire Won't Work</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #283, November 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
You'll probably get tired of hearing about my farm, but it has been a
great opportunity for me technology-wise to learn about new products. I've
never had property with acreage, and so the idea of remote outbuildings
is new. If you look at Figure 1, you'll see my farmhouse
is about 200 feet away from the barn. We don't raise animals, but we're
remodeling the barn into a tech-friendly location for music, parties,
worship and movie nights. That requires bandwidth, if nothing else,
so Spotify can be streamed for entertainment. The metal roof extends
down the sides of the building and makes it impossible to get a Wi-Fi
signal from inside the barn. So I tried to find an affordable wireless
bridge that was reliable and wouldn't saturate the 2.4GHz spectrum
on my farm. Thankfully, the EnGenius ENH500 outdoor wireless bridge
(available in pairs on Amazon) did the trick.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249bridgef1.large.jpg"><img src="12249bridgef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Farm
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249bridgef2.large.jpg"><img src="12249bridgef2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The EnGenius ENH500 Outdoor Wireless Bridge
</p></div></div><p>
The ENH500 is 5GHz-only, and once configured, it acts like a physical wire
connecting the two ends. The devices obviously don't show up in my UniFi
WiFi management software, but they also don't interfere with communication
to the remote APs in the barn. I set them up in WPS bridge mode, which
involves entering the MAC addresses of each device into the other, and
pointed them in the general direction of each other. The connection is
rock-solid, throughput is amazing, and since they're using the uncluttered
5GHz frequency range, there aren't any issues with my other devices. I
do wish the &ldquo;signal strength&rdquo; meter worked in WPS Bridge mode, but for
some reason, the layer-2 bridge doesn't allow the fancy strength lights
to work. You have to check the dB strength via the web interface to
make sure you have a solid connection.
</p><p>
Honestly, once they're set up, the EnGenius bridge devices just work. I
don't notice any difference from having a wired connection, and it was
much easier (and cheaper!) than running a fiber-optic cable out to the
barn. If you have an outbuilding or need to extend network coverage
across an area that would be challenging to hard-wire, the EnGenius
bridges work as advertised!

<h2 class="title">The Last Mile</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #283, November 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
You may have noticed that I've mentioned in my last few articles that my family recently bought a
farm. It's beautiful. There are rolling hills, scenic landscapes and this
time of year, the autumn leaves are stunning. When we considered buying the
place, my first concern was the availability of broadband internet. Yes,
I eventually checked out the house's foundation and such, but really, if
I couldn't get broadband, it was a showstopper. Thankfully, the farmhouse
is serviced by CenturyLink DSL. And so, we bought the farm. Unfortunately,
I didn't realize DSL speeds in rural areas could be as slow as 2.5mbps
down and less than 0.5mbps up. Not only is it impossible to stream HD
video, it's almost impossible to browse the internet at all!
</p><p>
So for the past few months, I've been doing everything I can to cache
videos, proxy web traffic and delay network maintenance until the wee hours
of the night to preserve what precious throughput is available. Then I
stumbled across <a href="https://unlimitedlteadvanced.com" target="_self">https://unlimitedlteadvanced.com</a>. The URL sounds like a phishing
site. The site looks like a pre-baked phishing site. And the product
offering seems too good to be true, and it comes with a hefty up-front
fee. There is little in the way of reviews online, but I still pursued
the idea for a couple reasons:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Did I mention the DSL speeds?
</p></li><li><p>
Unlimited LTE Advanced resells T-Mobile cellular data. Historically,
T-Mobile has had zero coverage in my area. Oddly enough, however, there's
a tiny little tower about a mile from my farm that T-Mobile leases space
on. In fact, I literally can <span   class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> the tower from my farmhouse kitchen
window. And although T-Mobile does QOS management on crowded towers, the
odds of my little tower being crowded is slim to none.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I decided to try it. For the Sim-only plan with a Netgear LB-1120
cellular modem (awesome product, by the way) so I could use my own router, it
was close to $300 to start up. There is a 14-day trial window (shipping
time counts against the 14 days!) that allows you to cancel, but you're
out the activation fee, which is the majority of the initial cost. And
unless you have T-Mobile, there's no way to know what your bandwidth
actually might look like until you get the hardware.
</p><p>
In the end, I got the equipment and sim card in two different
shipments. They came from two different companies, neither named
&ldquo;Unlimited LTE Advanced&rdquo;. But when I plugged everything in, I
got five bars
of service, and my bandwidth is around 18mbps up and 7mbps down. The
service is $76 a month, which might seem expensive, but crappy DSL was
$50 a month. And so far, I haven't noticed any issues with data caps or
throttling, even when streaming 1080p HD video. If you need broadband
service, and you are in a T-Mobile LTE coverage area, I can actually
recommend Unlimited LTe Advanced for internet service. But boy does
it seem sketchy during the sign-up period!

<h2 class="title">Security Cameras, Free Software</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #283, November 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
It's no secret that I love Ubiquiti hardware. Its Wi-Fi access points
are amazing, and its management software installs perfectly on my Linux
servers completely free. Since we recently purchased a farm that we
visit only on the weekends, I decided to give the Ubiquiti security camera
system a try. I'm happy to say, it works just as well as the Wi-Fi and
networking systems. In fact, it has a web-based management system that
installs on my Linux servers as well. It's completely free, and it has all
the major features you'd expect from an NVR.
</p><p>
There are a few oddities with the Ubiquiti UniFi Video system, but all
are tolerable. First, Ubiquiti wants you to purchase its NVR hardware to
manage the cameras. It's a small, energy-efficient computer that works
perfectly fine. But it's just that, a computer running Linux. If you dig
a bit on the website, you can find the software and install it on your own
computer! It's the exact same hardware, and it even gives you free access
to Ubiquiti's &ldquo;cloud access&rdquo;, which allows the software to log
in to the cloud
server and gives you remote access via the web (<a href="http://video.ubnt.com" target="_self">video.ubnt.com</a>)
or mobile apps without the need to forward any ports into your network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12249unifinvrf1.large.jpg"><img src="12249unifinvrf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The cameras are incredibly high-quality, and they provide 1080p video
with sound. The dome camera is POE+, but the soda-can style camera is
sadly 24v passive POE only. If you buy them singly, they come with power
injectors, but if you buy a five-pack of the cameras, know that they don't
come with any POE injectors, regardless of the camera style you get. If
you use UniFi switches that support 24v passive POE, it's no problem,
but otherwise, you need to figure a way to power the cameras.
</p><p>
The UniFi software (again, free, but not open source) allows you to record
motion and be notified if any motion has been recorded. You can
access the recording or the live feed remotely (as in the picture here). You
can set the software to delete old footage after a certain time frame
or tell it to start erasing old video once a certain amount of free space
has been reached on the computer. It supports a large number of cameras,
and so far, I've been extremely impressed by the quality of the hardware
and software. Not surprising, but still, it's great to see Ubiquiti
carrying its product quality into the video-surveillance world as well.
