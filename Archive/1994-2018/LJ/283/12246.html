Think it's complex to connect your Python program to the UNIX shell? Think
again!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2032580.0x212a408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my past few articles, I've been looking into concurrency in Python
via threads. The good news with threads is that they are relatively
easy to work with and let you share data among threads without too
much trouble. The bad news is that if you're not careful, you can end
up with serious problems&mdash;because data isn't shared, and Python data
structures aren't thread-safe. But perhaps a bigger problem is that
Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) guarantees that only one thread
runs at a time.
</p><p>
In many cases, this isn't really a problem. In particular, if you're
writing programs that work with the filesystem or network, you
probably won't feel the pain of Python threads too badly. That's
because while only one thread runs at a time, a thread gives up
control of the CPU whenever it uses I/O. This is because disks and
networks are many times slower than CPUs; while you're waiting for the
filesystem to give you the data you've requested, another thread can be
running.
</p><p>
That said, there definitely are times when Python's threads show their
limitations. In particular, if you're writing code that is CPU-bound&mdash;that is,
in which the CPU is the bottleneck&mdash;you'll find
that threads are limited. After all, if you have a nice 48-core
machine with which to play, doesn't it seem silly to have only
one of those cores actually doing something?
</p><p>
There is, of course, a solution to these problems&mdash;one that many
traditional UNIX users consider to be superior under many
circumstances: <span   class="emphasis"><em>processes</em></span>. Rather than run a function in a new thread,
run it in a new process!
</p><p>
So in this article, I take an initial look at working with processes in
Python to do a very common task: invoking external commands. In so
doing, I also cover how working with processes is structured, leading to
my next article's topic: the &ldquo;multiprocessing&rdquo; module.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2032580.0x212a7d0"></a>
Process Basics</h2></div></div><p>
For Linux users, nothing is more basic and everyday than a
process. When I fire up Emacs, I start a process. When I start the
Apache HTTP server, I start a process, which then starts multiple,
additional processes. When I invoke <tt  >ls</tt> on the command line, I'm
starting a process. And when I tell my computer to shut down, it does
so by killing each of those processes.
</p><p>
Think of a process as a data structure that represents a
computer at a particular moment in time. A process has code that is
running (including code that has yet to run); it has data on which the
program works; it has access to memory to store and retrieve
additional data, and it can talk to external devices, from filesystems
and networks to keyboards and screens.
</p><p>
A single Linux machine can run many, many processes at once. For the
split second during which a process runs, it has the illusion of
having complete control over the computer. It's thanks to the fact
that modern computers are so fast that you can run so many processes
and yet have them all appear to be running concurrently. True, modern
computers have multiple CPUs (aka &ldquo;cores&rdquo;), which lets you divide the
work among those cores.
</p><p>
There are all sorts of ways to start processes in Python. In modern
versions of the language, you can use the &ldquo;subprocess&rdquo; module to start
up a process and even retrieve the result. For example, you can invoke
the <tt  >ls</tt> program in a new process and then view the results:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; subprocess.check_output('ls')
</pre>
</p><p>
From this function, you get a string containing the output from the
<tt  >ls</tt> command. It's a big ugly one to see, especially if you're used to
seeing things printed nicely. In such a case, you don't want to view
the string that was returned, but rather to print it. The thing is,
that doesn't seem to work, at least not in Python 3:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output('ls'))
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem is that, by default, <tt  >subprocess.check_output</tt> returns a
&ldquo;bytestring&rdquo;, similar to a Python 2 string, in that it contains a
sequence of bytes, rather than a sequence of Unicode characters. The
issue here is that when you print a bytestring, Python doesn't actually
go to a new line when it sees <tt  >\n</tt>.
</p><p>
You can get around this problem by telling Python to interpret newline
characters liberally and to return a string instead of a bytestring:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output('ls', universal_newlines=True))
</pre>
</p><p>
This seems to work quite nicely. But what if you want to print only a
subset of the files in the current directory? It seems natural to
want to say, for example, <tt  >ls -l</tt>. Let's try that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output('ls -l', universal_newlines=True))
</pre>
</p><p>
When you do that, you get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/
&#8618;Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py",
 &#8618;line 336, in check_output
    **kwargs).stdout
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/
&#8618;Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py",
 &#8618;line 403, in run
    with Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs) as process:
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/
&#8618;Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py",
 &#8618;line 707, in __init__
    restore_signals, start_new_session)
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/
&#8618;Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py",
 &#8618;line 1333, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ls -l'
</pre>
</p><p>
What's wrong here? Very simply, Python is trying to run an external
process, giving it the Linux command <tt  >ls -l</tt>. You might think that
this is normal and reasonable, since running <tt  >ls -l</tt> is
something you likely do all the time in
your day-to-day lives. But remember that <tt  >ls</tt> is the command,
and <tt  >-l</tt>
is a flag to that command. You can understand the difference, and the
shell typically separates them for you. But if you simply hand that
command name to Linux, it's going to get confused and complain.
</p><p>
So instead of passing a single string, you'll need to pass a list of
strings, in which each represents a &ldquo;word&rdquo; of the command. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l'], universal_newlines=True))
</pre>
</p><p>
This works just fine. You can add other arguments, including the names
of files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l', 'urls.txt'],
&gt;&gt;&gt; universal_newlines=True))
</pre>
</p><p>
What if you want to get a long listing of all &ldquo;.txt&rdquo; files? 
Just try this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l', *.txt'], 
 &#8618;universal_newlines=True))

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l', '*.txt'],
&gt;&gt;&gt; universal_newlines=True))
ls: cannot access '*.txt': No such file or directory
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/
&#8618;Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py",
 &#8618;line 336, in check_output
    **kwargs).stdout
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.6.2/Frameworks/
&#8618;Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py",
 &#8618;line 418, in run
    output=stdout, stderr=stderr)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['ls', '-l', '*.txt']' 
 &#8618;returned non-zero exit status 2.
</pre>
</p><p>
It complains that &ldquo;*.txt&rdquo; isn't a legitimate file. That's because
while you might think that Linux always knows that * represents all
of the files in a directory, that's not the case&mdash;it is the shell
that performs the interpretation of such characters as &ldquo;*&rdquo;, dividing
things up and then passing them along to the underlying operating
system.
</p><p>
So, how can you list all of the files with a &ldquo;*.txt&rdquo; suffix? You can
invoke the same call once again, but tell Python to pass the
parameters through the UNIX shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l', '*.txt'],
                                  shell=True,
                                  universal_newlines=True))
</pre>
</p><p>
Aha! It now seems to work just fine.
</p><p>
So, what happened here? This started a new process (a &ldquo;subprocess&rdquo;, if
you will), and in that process, executed a UNIX program. The
program returned some text, that Python captured, and then printed it
out.
</p><p>
The Python documentation makes it clear that having <tt  >shell=True</tt> in your
call to <tt  >subprocess.check_output</tt> (and other functions) is a potential
security risk. If you're getting input from an unknown or untrusted
user, that person can insert arbitrary commands into the system
on which <tt  >check_output</tt> is running. Be sure to consider the security
implications of <tt  >shell=True</tt> before using it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2032580.0x212ba60"></a>
More Generally</h2></div></div><p>
<tt  >subprocess.check_output</tt> is a specific function, one that's designed
to run a program and retrieve its output. If you want a bit more
flexibility, you can run other functions from &ldquo;subprocess&rdquo;.
</p><p>
For example, let's say you want to take the output from <tt  >ls</tt> and
put it into a file. On the UNIX command line, you could say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l &gt; file-list.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
In Python, this is a bit more complex, but not terribly so if you use
<tt  >subprocess.run</tt> This function is new (as of Python 3.5), but it makes
life a bit easier.
</p><p>
You can try this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; subprocess.run(['/bin/ls', '-l'], universal_newlines=True)
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, <tt  >subprocess.run</tt> takes many similar arguments to
<tt  >subprocess.check_output</tt>. But what's different is that
it doesn't return a string, even when <tt  >universal_newlines</tt> is set to
<tt  >True</tt>. Instead, it returns an instance of
<tt  >subprocess.CompletedProcess</tt>,
which contains all sorts of information about the process that ran.
</p><p>
You can grab this, and then see what the <tt  >CompletedProcess</tt> contains:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cp = subprocess.run(['/bin/ls', '-l'], universal_newlines=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(cp)
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll get back:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{'args': ['/bin/ls', '-l'], 'returncode': 0, 'stderr': None,
'stdout': None}
</pre>
</p><p>
Hmm, that's likely not quite what you wanted. The <tt  >args</tt> is fine, and
<tt  >returncode</tt> is accurately showing 0, meaning that everything ended
just fine. But what happened to the output? The answer is that when
it comes to <tt  >subprocess.run</tt>, you need to indicate where the output
should go.
</p><p>
The way to indicate that you want to get something back is to pass
<tt  >subprocess.PIPE</tt> as the value of the
<tt  >stdout</tt> keyword argument:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cp = subprocess.run(['/bin/ls', '-l'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
&gt;&gt;&gt; universal_newlines=True)
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(cp)
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll now get the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{'args': ['/bin/ls', '-l'],
 'returncode': 0,
 'stderr': None,
 'stdout': 'total 344\ndrwxr-xr-x  1454 reuven  staff  49436 
   &#8618;Sep 17 09:29 Archive\ndrwxr-xr-x    37 reuven  staff   1
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm not even going to show you the rest, because it's so long, but
the <tt  >stdout</tt> value is precisely right.
</p><p>
You also can assign <tt  >stderr</tt> to
<tt  >subprocess.PIPE</tt> in order to receive
it. Note that in the case of both stdout and stderr, you can
assign not just <tt  >subprocess.PIPE</tt>, which lets you grab and work with the
program's output, but also an open (writable) file object. This means
you can invoke an external process and put its output into an
arbitrary file. I'd argue that most of the time, the reason you would be 
executing an external process in Python is that you want to do
something to the text, but this will work.
</p><p>
You might be wondering whether you can not only write to stderr and
stdout, but also read from stdin. And the answer is definitely. Just
provide a file object, and <tt  >subprocess.run</tt> will do the rest. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; cp = subprocess.run(['/bin/cat', '-n'], stdin=open('/etc/passwd'),
                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, universal_newlines=True)
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, you run <tt  >/bin/cat</tt> with the
<tt  >-n</tt> option, numbering the lines
of a file. What's the input file? /etc/passwd. And where does the
output go? To your <tt  >subprocess.PIPE</tt> object, which is a kind of
communication channel to external processes.
</p><p>
For me, the most interesting thing is the <tt  >CompletedProcess</tt> object
(<tt  >cp</tt>), from which you can grab different pieces of information about
the completed process. Note that <tt  >subprocess.run</tt> will return
only after the external program has finished running, at which point
the <tt  >cp</tt> variable will be set. And from there, you can grab
<tt  >stdout</tt>,
which is normally a bytestring, but which is an actual (Unicode)
string if you set <tt  >universal_newlines</tt> to
<tt  >True</tt>.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
You've now seen how you can use the &ldquo;subprocess&rdquo; module to communicate
with external processes. But let's face it. This doesn't exactly
solve the initial problem: breaking a
problem up and using different processes to handle it. Rather, this
shows, at some level, how Python works with processes and the basic
ways in which it communicates with them, using bytestrings and
pipes. That's because processes are separate and cannot simply share
variables with the main thread, which is what you're doing when
using threads.
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll discuss how you can break problems apart in a thread-like
fashion using the &ldquo;multiprocessing&rdquo; module. That has the advantage of
opening new processes for each task you want to accomplish while
giving you a thread-like interface to do so.
