Linux is no longer an obscure platform avoided by those with malicious
intent. It used to be that people with Windows 95 were the only ones
getting viruses or experiencing security vulnerabilities, but that's before
Linux migrated to the cloud. Now, basically everything runs on Linux, both
inside and outside the office data center. That means network and OS
security is more important than ever before, and now, Linux users need to
be especially aware! The good news is, most Linux users know security is
important and realize it's a topic that needs to be approached
proactively. So this month, we look at some great ways to make our world a
little more secure.
</p><p>
Our feature article is by Charles Fisher, and he explains how to use simple, but
secure methods for maintaining multiple machines on your network using
strong SSH keys and Parallel Distributed Shell. Although configuration
management and system orchestration tools are powerful, sometimes it's
important to strip back all the extraneous functionality and just execute
remote commands on multiple computers over a secure connection. Charles
describes how to configure your clients and perform tasks securely over the
network.
</p><p>
I previously mentioned the cloud and how Linux is a vital part in almost all
cloud-based computing. In light of that, Nathan R. Vance and William F.
Polik discuss how to
go a step further and not only use cloud computer instances, but also
to create an entire cluster of computers in the cloud. When scalability is
instant, it means your cluster can grow and shrink as you need it, saving
tons of money in hardware investment and resource management. Plus, the
authors
include information on a hybrid cluster, where the head node is on local
hardware and the compute instances are spun up in the cloud only as
needed.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin wrote a Lightning Hacks article this month to provide a handful
of really great ideas in a really short amount of time. This time, Kyle's
focus is on Qubes tips and how he does some pretty nifty things with it on his
system. As with most of Kyle's work, these tips can be adapted if you don't
happen to be a Qubes user, but regardless of the system you use, it's
always worthwhile to read Kyle's column! 
</p><p>
I finish off my series on Ansible
this month, which is another tool you may or may not be using. Hopefully
after following along on this four-part series, you've at least given Ansible
a try in your own network. Even the smallest implementation can save hours
of work, and the time required to get started is minimal.
</p><p>
We also have great information for coders and developing developers.
Reuven M. Lerner continues teaching about Python this month, with
particular focus on launching external processes from inside a Python
script. Some tools in the Linux shell are invaluable, and
often it's nice to utilize them inside the script of another language, like
Python. 
</p><p>
Dave Taylor follows Reuven with his shell scripting column, which
teaches all about those convenient shell tools! This month, he explores
using mathematical evaluation tools in order to make a guessing game.
Along the way, you'll learn to make clear, readable code so your guessing game
can be the foundation for more complicated and usable code. As usual, Dave
teaches valuable skills while readers get to play command-line games.
</p><p>
We also have new products, reviews, tech tips and all the other goodies
you've come to expect month after month from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. So whether you're
trying to secure your existing infrastructure or just starting to build
that infrastructure and want to do it in a wise and secure fashion, this
issue is here to serve. Enjoy, and we'll see you again next
month!
