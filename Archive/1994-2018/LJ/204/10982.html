Why let registrars have all the fun? Learn how to set up your own
DNS server completely under your own control.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x205d580.0x2155408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this day and age, it's simple and popular to have someone else change
your oil, grow your vegetables, remodel your house and host your services.
However, I'd argue that it's far more rewarding, educational and not very difficult to
manage these things yourself. This column is the second in a series about
how to manage your own services on your own server. In the first column, I
discussed how to make sure your home network is ready to host your own
services. In this column, I start to get into the meat of the topic
and discuss the first service you can (and should) set up at home: DNS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x205d580.0x21555c0"></a>
A Short Primer on DNS</h2></div></div><p>
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system you use every day and one on which the
Internet heavily depends. Every server (including your own) that
has a presence on the Internet should have a public IP address. Since 
last month's column, you should have your home network set up for your
server and have at least one public IP (hopefully static) you can use.
It's true that all you really need to host many services on the Internet is
an IP address; however, in practice, there are only so many IP addresses
(like phone numbers) that the average person is going to commit to memory.
As IPv6 becomes commonplace, this will be even more true. DNS allows you to
register a domain name and associate individual host names (like
www.example.com and mail.example.com) to IP addresses. 
</p><p>
For instance, how many of you (besides you, Katherine) have
www.linuxjournal.com's IP address memorized? If you did want to know the IP
address, all you would need to do is perform a simple nslookup command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nslookup www.linuxjournal.com
Server:		192.168.0.1
Address:	192.168.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	www.linuxjournal.com
Address: 76.74.252.198
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, the first bit of output tells me that I'm getting this
answer from a DNS server at 192.168.0.1 (my own personal DNS server) and
that the IP address for www.linuxjournal.com is currently 76.75.252.198.
There isn't enough space in this column to describe everything that
happened to allow me to get that IP address, but essentially, my DNS server
asked other DNS servers on the Internet for this IP address and was
subsequently redirected to more and more DNS servers until it finally found
the one that knew the answer. If you are interested in more detail on how
this works, books like <span   class="emphasis"><em>DNS and BIND</em></span> do a good job of explaining it, or from
the command line, you could run <tt  >dig www.linuxjournal.com
+trace</tt>.

Your Own DNS Server</h2></div></div><p>
DNS seems like a complicated service, yet it's relatively simple to set up
a DNS server of your own. Now, there are a number of different DNS server
software from which to choose that are easier to configure or that have fancy
database back ends, but for this article, I'm going to choose the old
standby, BIND. Although it's not as simple as other DNS servers, it isn't so
bad, once you get the hang of it.
</p><p>
BIND should be packaged for most major distributions; however, there are
slight differences in how each distribution packages BIND. For instance,
under Red Hat, you install the bind package, but under Debian-based
systems (like Ubuntu), you install bind9. Red Hat stores its core BIND
configuration file at /etc/named.conf and all its zone files (files that
contain name&rarr;IP address mappings for a domain, such as example.org, a
subdomain, such as ny.example.org, or possibly both) under /var/named, while
Debian-based systems put named.conf and any zone files under the /etc/bind/
directory. Even the init script is different on both systems: Red Hat uses
/etc/init.d/named, and Debian-based systems use /etc/init.d/bind9. Once
you get past the differences, however, the syntax inside the files should
be similar. Just to simplify things, I'm going to base the rest of this
article off a standard Ubuntu 10.04 LTS server, so we have some sort of
baseline. If you use a different distribution, however, it shouldn't be too
difficult to adapt these instructions to the different file paths.
</p><p>
Once BIND is installed on the system, the package should create a basic
named.conf file and all of the base directories. In the case of this sample
Ubuntu system, the default named.conf actually will be set up to act as a
caching name server. So, out of the box you should be able to
point to this server with other hosts on your network, and it will be able
to resolve other domains on the Internet just like with your ISP's DNS
server. In this case, though, we want to create a DNS master.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x205d580.0x2155a90"></a>
Master DNS Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
A DNS master contains its own zone files that have name&rarr;IP address
mappings, and it doesn't have to consult any other source to answer queries for
those names. By contrast, a DNS slave is configured to load all of its zone
configurations from a DNS master. Any future changes are made on the master
and propagate to each of the slaves. Any individual BIND instance acts as a
DNS master, a DNS slave or a caching name server, or all three at the same
time (although it can be a master or a slave only to any individual zone,
not both).
</p><p>
For this example, let's set up a DNS master for example.org, and this
master will have the following records:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ns1.example.org, which points to 123.12.34.56 (the public IP of the name
server itself).
</p></li><li><p>
example.org, which points to 123.12.34.57.
</p></li><li><p>
www.example.org also points to 123.12.34.57.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To start, I create the zone file at /etc/bind/db.example.org (remember
Red Hat stores these zones in a different places) and put the following
information in it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
;
; BIND data file for example.org
;
$TTL 4h
@  IN  SOA ns1.example.org. root.example.org. (
	    2		; Serial
	    604800 	; Refresh
	    86400 	; Retry
	    2419200 	; Expire
	    604800 ) 	; Negative Cache TTL
;
@	IN NS	ns1.example.org.
@ 	IN A	123.12.34.57
www	IN A	123.12.34.57
ns1 	IN A 	123.12.34.56
</pre>
</p><p>
Make sure this file has similar permissions to the other zone files you
find in the /etc/bind directory. The first non-comment line in the file
sets the TTL or Time To Live, the default time in which a remote DNS server
will cache any answers it gets from your DNS server before it will ask it
again. The value you put here will help determine how fast changes you make
will propagate. BIND accepts seconds in this field, or you can use
shorthand values like 1d for one day, 4h for four hours or 20m for 20
minutes. I set the TTL to four hours here; however, if you make frequent
changes to your records (or know you are going to soon), you may want to
make the TTL shorter. On the other hand, if you find you hardly ever change
these values, you might want to bump up the TTL to a day to reduce load on
your DNS server.
</p><p>
Something to note is that zone files use semicolons not hashes at the
beginning of a line for comments. A common mistake is to put hashes in a
zone file to make a comment, reload BIND and then wonder why your changes
didn't take. When BIND sees a mistake like that, it just skips that
particular zone. 
</p><p>
To keep things simple, I'm going to skip the Retry, Refresh and other
values here&mdash;just keep them with these defaults unless you know what you
are doing. The Serial line is for DNS slaves, which I discuss later.
Below those values, however, you'll see the syntax I used to define the
different records:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@	IN NS	ns1.example.org.
@ 	IN A	123.12.34.57
www	IN A	123.12.34.57
ns1 	IN A 	123.12.34.56
</pre>
</p><p>
The first record starts with @, which means it is a record for example.org
itself. In this case, it is an NS record that defines the hostname I'm going
to use for my name server. You can use any hostname you control here
(including hostnames on a different domain, actually), but one popular
convention is to use hostnames like ns1 and ns2 for the first and second
name servers. The second record begins with an @ as well, only in this
case,
it's an A record. An A record is a fundamental DNS record that maps a
hostname (like www) to an IP address (like 123.12.34.57). In this case,
because the record starts with @, I am setting the IP address for example.org
itself. The next two lines define two more A records, one for
www.example.org and one for ns1.example.org. It's important if you used a
name within this same domain for your name server (like ns1.example.org)
that you be sure to add an A record so that it has an IP address.
</p><p>
Now that I have created my zone, next I need to modify the
/etc/bind/named.conf file and add a new section at the end of the file to
point to the /etc/bind/db.example.org file I just created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
zone "example.org" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/db.example.org";
};
</pre>
</p><p>
After the file is changed, I reload BIND, and I should be able to send DNS
requests to my new DNS server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo /etc/init.d/bind9 reload
* Reloading domain name server... bind [OK]

$ nslookup www.example.org localhost
Server:		localhost
Address:	127.0.0.1#53

Name:	www.example.org
Address: 123.12.34.56
</pre>
</p><p>
If there is a problem with the BIND reload, it should tell you on the
command line. Otherwise, if it still doesn't work, you may have to look in
your syslog file (/var/log/syslog on Debian-based systems and
/var/log/messages on Red Hat) for clues.

Slave DNS Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Many registrars on the Internet require that any domain you register have
at least two DNS servers configured with it. It's a good practice to have,
because if you have a single DNS server and it goes down, it effectively
will make all your servers under that domain inaccessible. This means you
need to set up a second DNS server on a different IP, ideally on a different
network, or have a friend with a DNS server act as a slave to your master
DNS server. In either case, it's a relatively simple process. Let's say that
my second DNS server is going to be at the IP address 98.76.54.32. First, I
would log in to my Master DNS server and add the new NS and A records to my
zone file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
;
; BIND data file for example.org
;
$TTL 4h
@  IN  SOA ns1.example.org. root.example.org. (
	    2		; Serial
	    604800 	; Refresh
	    86400 	; Retry
	    2419200 	; Expire
	    604800 ) 	; Negative Cache TTL
;
@	IN NS	ns1.example.org.
@	IN NS	ns2.example.org.
@ 	IN A	123.12.34.57
www	IN A	123.12.34.57
ns1 	IN A 	123.12.34.56
ns2 	IN A 	98.76.54.32
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I edit named.conf and add a line to the configuration of example.org
so that it will allow zone transfers from my DNS slave:

<pre     class="programlisting">
zone "example.org" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/db.example.org";
	allow-transfer { 98.76.54.32; };
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I would install BIND on the second server, or if it already
exists, all I would have to do is add a new entry at the end of the
named.conf file to define the example.org zone and tell this server the IP
address of the master:

<pre     class="programlisting">
zone "example.org" {
	type slave;
	file "/var/cache/bind/db.example.org";
	masters { 123.12.34.56; };
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that in this case the slave zone is being stored under
/var/cache/bind. That's the default location for slave zone files under
Debian-based systems. Under Red Hat, you would store them under
/var/named/. Once I reload BIND on the slave server, it will pull the new
zone information from the master, and I should be able to perform DNS
queries against it. 
</p><p>
Once you have set up a slave, keep in mind that anytime you make a change
to the master, you will need to increment the Serial field in the Master's
zone file (in my example, it is set to 2, but a lot of administrators like to
set it to the current date plus two extra number fields, such as
2010120500). When the slave needs to know whether its zone information is
up to date, it compares its serial number with the serial number on the
master. If the master's serial number for a zone is higher, it copies down
the new zone information; otherwise, it sticks with what it has cached.

Domain Registration</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have a functioning DNS server, all that's left is to tell the
world to use it. If you haven't already registered your domain with a
registrar, find a domain registration service on the Internet (there are too
many for me to list here, but a search for domain name registration should
turn up plenty). When you register the domain, most registrars will let you
use their own DNS servers for your domain, but you don't need them! When you
get to the point in the registration process where it asks you about your
DNS servers, just give them the public IP address for your own DNS server
(in my case, it would be ns1.example.org or 123.12.34.56). Note that many
registrars require you to have two DNS servers defined for a domain, so in
that case, set up a slave DNS server and add its IP address as well. Once
you complete the registration process and allow the new domain information
time to propagate around the Internet, you will have the ability make IP
changes for your Web, mail and other servers all from your own machines.
