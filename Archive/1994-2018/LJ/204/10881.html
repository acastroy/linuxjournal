AJAX is power. It makes Internet applications look, feel and perform in the
eyes of the user like desktop apps, all while run from the server and
written in the platform-agnostic languages of HTML and JavaScript. But, it
carries a heavy price: breaking the browser. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x13932a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;The customer is always right.&rdquo; This time-worn adage&mdash;attributed
to either
Harry Selfridge, founder of the famous British Selfridges department
store, or Marshall Field, of the Chicago department store that bears his
name&mdash;has been discussed and dissected to no end. Undoubtedly, every one
of us can come up with plenty of cases when customers aren't right,
and it does not make sense to treat them that way. What is true, however,
is that if you want to sell (or develop) something that's useful to
customers, you must build it for the way they <span   class="emphasis"><em>actually</em></span> work,
not the way you <span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> them to work.
</p><p>
In the Web's early days, we were all entranced by the ability to
access any application anywhere, without installing anything more than
a browser. Developers loved the idea of writing in a single universal
language. Even better, HTML is declarative&mdash;no interesting components
and callbacks, no per-platform or per-OS-version oddities (more or
less). Users loved the simple book paradigm. You could go back and forward
(which, unsurprisingly, were the names of the buttons), and even click
reload. The semantics were simple; writing for the platform was easy,
and deployment, compared to managing each desktop, felt like the new
Enlightenment.
</p><p>
The downsides, of course, were obvious, but a fair price to pay. If each
page was statically generated with just HTML, every change, however
small&mdash;say a change in text or adding a warning&mdash;required a complete
page reload. Besides the headache for the user, it was unnatural and
slow. Some pundits in the 1990s suggested that the Web would never be a
dominant platform for this very reason. Dynamic HTML based on JavaScript,
which allowed DOM manipulation, gave us some leeway, but anything that
came from the server&mdash;real data&mdash;required a reload.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1393618"></a>
Enter AJAX</h2></div></div><p>
In the early to mid-2000s, developers began to explore how to communicate
with the server without requiring page reload. Microsoft introduced
the XMLHTTP ActiveX control in 1999, later adopted by every other
browser. In 2005, Jesse Garrett, cofounder of Adaptive Path, coined the
term Asynchronous JavaScript with XML, or AJAX. Although Jesse didn't
invent it, he certainly popularized it, which once again underscores
the importance of marketing that we engineers tend to overlook. As an
interesting aside, one of the earliest known usages of AJAX occurred
in...1596, by Sir John Harington, to describe his new invention: the
flush toilet.
</p><p>
AJAX was wonderful. We could get what we wanted from the server without
reloading the entire Web page. We could process it in the background. We
could get as little or as much as we wanted. It seemed Web apps, now
called Rich Internet Apps, finally were fully competitive with desktop
apps in terms of ease of deployment <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> performance. It enabled
such ubiquitous apps as Google Maps, which would have been impossible
without AJAX.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1393828"></a>
The User Is the Problem?</h2></div></div><p>
The big problem with AJAX apps is that they broke Web semantics. The
Refresh, Back and Forward buttons work entirely on the address
in the URL bar of the browser. In the days of static pages, that mostly
indicated where you were: http://example.com/store?product=12345
was definitely different from
http://example.com/store?product=99999.
</p><p>
In the modern RIA AJAX world, however, the URL was
http://example.com/store.
With the product rendered using AJAX, the URL unchanged, reloading was highly
unlikely to bring you back to where you were.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1393988"></a>
First Attempts</h2></div></div><p>
The first responses were to add complex state to the server. JavaEE,
PHP frameworks and others all added session variables in which you could
store oodles of information about what the user's last request was, and
so you could roughly attempt to reconstruct it for the next request. The
entire JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework is built around such complex
state semantics. These did the job, more or less, but they were very complex
and required lots of effort with which to work.
</p><p>
The next attempts essentially said, &ldquo;we don't support browser
buttons!&rdquo; Put in other terms, &ldquo;we and the technology are right, and
the user is wrong.&rdquo; As anyone who ever has been in business knows, this
strategy is doomed to failure. It may work, for a little while, if your
customer has no alternative, but customers who are told they are wrong and
&ldquo;just don't get it&rdquo; quickly will look for alternatives. Silicon Valley
is littered with the corpses of startups that whined, &ldquo;our customer
just doesn't get it.&rdquo; Of course, it was the startup (and the engineers)
who just didn't get it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1393c48"></a>
Technology-User Harmony</h2></div></div><p>
What we needed, then, was a way to use AJAX apps and modify the
URL bar in a way that it would <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> reload the page, yet still give
fairly complete indication of where we were. Thus, Back and Forward,
not to mention Refresh, would work just fine.
</p><p>
The magic is in one little character, the hash (#). In the HTML
specification RFC 1866, you can give a name to an anchor, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;a name="myname"/&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you do so, a browser should be able to go to the named section
on the page by appending # and the anchor name to the URL.
For example, if you have an HTML page named mypage.html:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;!-- lots of stuff --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Lots of content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;a name="part2"/&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Even more content&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
To get to the above page, you would go to
http://example.com/mypage.html. But, if you wanted to go to that page and
directly to part2, you would go to http://example.com/mypage.html#part2.
</p><p>
The most interesting part is that if the browser is <span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> on
mypage.html and you go to mypage.html#part2, the browser should,
and will, go directly to part2 <span   class="emphasis"><em>without reloading the Web
page</em></span>. Even
further, if the browser cannot find an anchor named part2, it will fail
silently and graciously. Last, but not least, JavaScript events can
capture this change and process it.
</p><p>
With the above, we have the making of a system that uses AJAX for Rich
Internet Application dynamism, yet can change the URL to indicate where
we are, and thus work with, rather than against, the user.
As a matter of fact, if you use Gmail and look closely, you will see
that this is exactly how it works.
</p><p>
Of course, remembering to manage the URLs can be difficult and changes
the way you work. Wouldn't someone have developed a framework to manage
all of this?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1394118"></a>
Enter Sammy</h2></div></div><p>
Sammy is an amazing Web framework developed by Aaron Quint. Not only
does it provide the framework for managing the URLs, as well as lots of
additional functionality to boot, but it also actually dramatically improves
how it writes your client-side apps. You move from programmatically driven
to declarative. You return to the ease of use of the early Web 1.0 days,
when the URL defined exactly where you were, but without giving up the
dynamism of AJAX.
Once again, the URL becomes the declarer of location in your app, and
you can leverage its full power.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x1394278"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Let's explore a basic Sammy app. For our purposes, let's use a contact
application. To keep things simple, let's not do any data updating in
this article, although Sammy's semantics fully support it. Let's stick
with simple GETs. In the contact application, we have ten contacts, each
with the ID of 1 through 10 (complicated!), and each with properties of
First Name, Last Name and Email. Our application view has a left pane,
wherein contacts are listed, and a right pane, wherein contact details
are shown. Remember, we want this to be a Rich Internet Application,
all running in a single page.
</p><p>
Word of warning: the code in this article may be incomplete. If you
want to download and run it, get the sample app off the Web (see Resources).
</p><p>
First, let's define our single HTML page contacts.html:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" 
 &#8618;src="jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" 
 &#8618;src="sammy.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" 
 &#8618;src="contactapp.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  #list {float: left; width: 48%;}
  #details {float: left; width: 48%;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contact Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on a contact to view the details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="list"&gt;
  &lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="details"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;First Name:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td id="firstName"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Last Name:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td id="lastName"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Email:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td id="email"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice several elements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Installation: we included jQuery, a prerequisite for Sammy (and a
really great library to boot).
</p></li><li><p>
Installation: we included Sammy, after jQuery.
</p></li><li><p>
HTML: the page is really simple. There are two blank divs, one with
the ID list, the other with the ID details. They are floated.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x129b580.0x13947a0"></a>
Declaring Our Paths</h2></div></div><p>
Next, we need to declare what all the states are in which the application
can exist. These will determine what paths we want. In our contacts app,
we really have only two states:
1) listing the contacts and 2) viewing one particular contact (while the main list remains open).
</p><p>
In keeping with RESTful style, let's declare our URLs as follows:
</p><p>
1) Listing the contacts: <tt  >contacts.html#/contacts</tt>.
</p><p>
2) Viewing one particular contact:
<tt  >contacts.html#/contacts/:id</tt> (where
:id is replaced by the ID of the viewed contact).
</p><p>
In addition, we want a default path. What happens if the user just opens contacts.html?
</p><p>
3) Default path: <tt  >contacts.html</tt>, re-routed to
<tt  >contacts.html#/contacts</tt>.
</p><p>
Notice something interesting. We are defining various declarative
paths. When each of these paths is encountered, we want to take a certain
action. Essentially, these are routes. Most Ruby-based frameworks (Sinatra,
Rails, Merb/Rails3 and so on) use this exact language, as does
Sammy.
</p><p>
So, we have three routes and their actions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >contacts.html</tt>&rarr;redirect to
<tt  >contacts.html#/contacts</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >contacts.html#/contacts</tt>&rarr;list contacts.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >contacts.html#/contacts/:id</tt>&rarr;show details for
<tt  >contact :id</tt>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In our included JavaScript file contactapp.js, we declare each of
the routes:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var app = $.sammy(function(){
  // for the verb GET with the path #/, go to #/contacts
  this.get("#/",function(context){
    this.redirect("#/contacts");
  });

  // for the verb GET with the path #/contacts, render the contacts
  this.get("#/contacts",function(context){
    // get our contact list from the server
    $.get("/contacts",function(res,status) {
      // render the results - should include 
      // status-checking for safety

      // jQuery already parsed the response to JSON for us
      var list = res, tr, td, table = $("#list table"), a;
      
      // clear the existing list
      table.empty();

      // use jQuery to go through each result
      $.each(list,function(i,elm) {
        tr = $("&lt;tr&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;").appendTo(table);
        td = $("&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;").appendTo(tr);
        // the key part: make it a URL
        a = $("&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;").attr("href","#/contacts/"+elm.id).text
        &#8618;(elm.lastName + " " + elm.firstName).appendTo(td);
      });
    },"json");

    // hide the details
    $("#details table").hide();
  });

  // for the verb GET with a specific path #/contacts/:id, 
  // render that one contact
  this.get("#/contacts/:id",function(context){
    // get our contact list from the server - access 
    // param :id as this.params.id
    $.get("/contacts/"+this.params.id,function(res,status) {
      // render the results - should include 
      // status-checking for safety
      // jQuery already parsed the response to JSON for us
      var contact = res, table = $("#details table");

      // find the elements in the table, and fill them with the data
      $("#firstName",table).text(contact.firstName);
      $("#lastName",table).text(contact.lastName);
      $("#email",table).text(contact.email);

      // make sure the table is shown
      table.show();
    },"json");
  });

});

// set up a default route for contacts.html
$(function(){
  app.run("#/");
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice several key elements:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
There are no event handlers here at all. Although we might need some
for things like edit buttons or key presses, navigation in the app really
happens using URL &lt;a&gt; links. This makes it really easy to manage the app
and understand what every change does. Clicking on a contact in the list
is clicking on a URL. We just happen to use that URL to control our app.
</p></li><li><p>
We could have used a handler just as well. Instead of
using an &lt;a&gt; link, we could have put on a handler with <tt  >$("list
td").click(function(e),{...});</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
This application is incredibly short and easy to understand. That is
the beauty of Sammy.
</p></li><li><p>
The browser URL changes, but the page does not reload. We remain in
the Rich Internet App world, yet browser semantics simply work: Back,
Forward, Reload. Try it!
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The full sample, without minified JS, is available on-line
(see Resources).

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Sammy gives us the power to provide Rich Internet
Applications simultaneously, work with the user's mindset rather than against it,
and program our apps using routes declaratively, making it much simpler to
build yet richer Internet applications.
</p><p>
The Sammy library is open source under the MIT license and available
on-line (see Resources).
