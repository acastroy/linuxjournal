Q4Wine&mdash;GUI Front End for Wine
(<a href="http://q4wine.brezblock.org.ua" target="_self">q4wine.brezblock.org.ua</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
There have been plenty of GUI front ends for Wine over the years, and to
be honest, I've hated pretty much all of them. However, this one has
turned me around, and I recommend it to you as well.
</p><p>
To quote the Web site:
&ldquo;Q4Wine is a Qt4 GUI for W.I.N.E. It will help you manage Wine prefixes
and installed applications.&rdquo; Also according to the Web site, Q4Wine
includes the following general features (and more):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It can export the Qt color theme into Wine color settings.
</p></li><li><p>
It can work with different Wine versions easily at the same time.
</p></li><li><p>
It's easy to create, delete and manage prefixes (WINEPREFIX).
</p></li><li><p>
It's easy to control Wine processes.
</p></li><li><p>
It supports autostart icons.
</p></li><li><p>
It provides easy CD image use.
</p></li><li><p>
You can extract icons from PE files (.exe, .dll).
</p></li><li><p>
It provides easy backup and restore for managed prefixes.
</p></li><li><p>
It includes Winetriks support.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11001f1.large.jpg"><img src="11001f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
A key feature of Q4Wine is its Processes tab, which acts as a built-in system
guard for misbehaving programs, but only for Wine-specific
programs&mdash;simple, but very clever.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11001f2.large.jpg"><img src="11001f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Q4Wine's real talent lies in letting you define Wine settings for one
program without affecting the whole system.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Binaries are provided for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, FreeBSD, Gentoo,
openSUSE, openmamba and Slackware, as well as the usual source
tarball. For those running with the source, the documentation says you
need the following libraries:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
sudo
</p></li><li><p>
wine
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=sqlite-3.5.6
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=which-2.19
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=icoutils-0.26.0
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=qt-4.4.0
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=qt-sql-4.4.0 (note: qt-sql might have sqlite driver support)
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=qt-gui-4.4.0
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=qt-core-4.4.0
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=qt-network-4.4.0
</p></li><li><p>
&gt;=qt-dbus-4.4.0
</p></li><li><p>
wget
</p></li></ul></div><p>
FuseISO is listed as an optional dependency, but I thoroughly recommend
it. I also had to install qt4-qmake and libqt4-dev.
</p><p>
Grab the latest tarball, extract it, open a terminal in the new folder,
and enter the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su 
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
To run the program, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ q4wine
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Before you can begin using Q4Wine, you'll be taken through a first startup
wizard. You'll be asked where the paths are for four Wine components,
with the first three most likely filled in already, and the last, wine
libs, empty, needing to be defined. This was /usr/lib32/wine on my system,
which is perhaps left empty for 32-/64-bit reasons?
</p><p>
Next is a similar screen for System utils paths (which thankfully
come pre-filled with defaults), followed by another page of settings
also pre-filled, but feel free to tweak them if you know what you're
doing. Network settings are next, followed by a very important step:
a quick mount profile.
</p><p>
This allows you to mount or unmount without root privileges, and hopefully, it
will let you eject a disc during multi-CD installations. FuseISO was
the default choice with my installation (although I deliberately chose to
install FuseISO for this purpose), but those without it may choose from
sudo or gui sudo.
</p><p>
Now that you're in the main GUI, look under the Setup tab. The Current
prefix: drop-down box gives you the brilliant option of choosing between
Wine versions if you have multiple versions installed.
</p><p>
If you click on the Programs tab, you're presented with a series of
default system programs, including wordpad, winecfg, explorer and so
on. The important thing for me, however, was the eject program, which let
me get through Valve's two-disc installation of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Orange
Box</em></span>, on which
I previously got stuck on disc one (either I couldn't eject it before,
or couldn't get disc two to read). So any <span   class="emphasis"><em>Half-Life</em></span> fans out there may
want to give this a go if you've also been having trouble.
</p><p>
Now, let's move on to actually adding programs. 
</p><p>
Still under the Programs tab is a current prefixes list, which under
my new installation was pretty spartan. I added a games folder by
right-clicking in the left pane and then clicking New. This brings up a
dialog box prompting you to enter a new directory name. Type in a name and click OK.
</p><p>
Now that you have a new folder, click on this folder, and in the right
pane, right-click and choose New. This adds a new icon, but
first brings up a window with a slew of options; this is where some of
the clever stuff lies.
</p><p>
The first two sections are pretty basic: the General section
is where you tell Q4Wine where the program is, and the Icon options is
where you give the icon a name and description. Thankfully, the General
section has a Browse button for both the program and working directory
fields, which saves you from having to enter these paths manually. For
those advanced users who want to add some arguments to the command,
a specific field is provided here.
</p><p>
One of my favorite parts is the Virtual desktop section at the bottom of
this tab. Here you can choose whether to have no virtual desktop at all,
or you can select from specific resolutions in the drop-down box. This
option is a piece of genius, as you don't have to go into winecfg and
pick different settings every time you run another program.
</p><p>
Go into the Override DLL tab, and you can choose specific DLLs to
override the default options, whether native or built-in. This option
will be familiar to anyone who's done this in winecfg, but with the
added benefit of applying a DLL override to just one program, without
affecting the rest of your system.
</p><p>
Back in the main screen, there's a Wine AppDB tab. Those who are new
to Wine may not realize there's a vast database on the Wine Web site
of Windows applications and how well they run under Wine. The aging
Web site and its database always has been somewhat cumbersome, but this
tab lets you skip the middleman and search the database from within
the Q4Wine itself.
</p><p>
A fear of mine when it comes to GUI front ends is that you can't always
terminate an errant program the way you can with a basic terminal. The
Q4Wine team has been extremely canny in that they've included a Processes
tab, where you have a system-monitor-style interface, but only with
Wine-specific processes. This is a game-changer for me.
</p><p>
Wine has many extensions based around it, but until now, they've mostly
been obscure projects that one had to seek out. Q4Wine integrates
the important extensions, and by the look of things, it will continue to
integrate more of these projects and extensions as they emerge.
I know that other GUIs have done this sort of thing in the past, but
Q4Wine really has the best interface.
</p><p>
I've been using Wine for about a decade now, and I've seen many GUIs
come and go. Either they've been too rudimentary in their features and
interface, or they've been slow and clunky, making one give
up on the whole process. Q4Wine is none of these. It's sleek, quick,
intuitive and packed with features.
I'll no longer stick to a terminal and do these things manually. In fact,
I just made a Q4Wine desktop shortcut. I'm converted.

deheader&mdash;C Header Analysis
(<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/deheader" target="_self">www.catb.org/~esr/deheader</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
In a world of ever-expanding code, it's easy to become sloppy, with lines
of redundant code or inelegant design coming into play. Thankfully,
deheader steps up to the plate&mdash;a simple tool that can save coders a
great deal of time.
</p><p>
According to the Web site:
&ldquo;deheader analyzes C and C++ files to determine which header inclusions
can be removed while still allowing them to compile. This may result in
substantial improvements in compilation time, especially on large C++
projects; it also sometimes exposes dependencies and cohesions of which
developers were unaware.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11001f3.large.jpg"><img src="11001f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
deheader scans code for redundant header inclusions. Here's some output
from the MPlayer Project, for instance.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation and Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As far as packages go, at the time of this writing, the only thing available
was a source tarball. But, fear not. No compiling is necessary, and
because there's no real mention of library requirements, I'm guessing most
distros will run it off the bat, assuming they have Python.
</p><p>
Download the latest tarball from the Web site, extract it, and open a
terminal in the new folder. Then, it's simply a case of running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./deheader path-of-files
</pre>
</p><p>
If the given path is a directory, deheader scans all the files
within. Give it some time to process, and eventually a list of all
the unnecessary headers appears on-screen. For instance, I chose
to analyze the now ten-year-old MPlayer code, a project that would
unavoidably have a lot of legacy code and loose ends simply from being
around for such a long time.
</p><p>
If you're ready to take things further, add a switch of
<tt  >-r</tt>, and the
unnecessary headers are removed from the files. If you want to do
some test compiling, use the <tt  >-m</tt> switch. As an example, here's a command
I ran against the MPlayer code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./deheader -r  ~/src/mplayer-export-2010-12-27/ 
</pre>
</p><p>
Those are the basics; refer to the documentation for
more information.
</p><p>
As you can see, deheader is a very simple-to-use program with an elegant
design. This ideal of coding elegance is manifest in deheader's results.
It should save a great deal of compilation time and highlight
coding foibles that likely would have remained unnoticed.
Although it's still sitting around in tarball source form, hopefully
it will make its way into distro repositories soon.

</p><p>
Fans of the hard-core gaming company, Razer, no doubt will want to look up this project. According to the Web site:
&ldquo;This is the next-generation Razer device configuration tool bringing the
Razer gaming experience to the free, Open Source world. This utility is
supposed to replace the old deathaddercfg utility. The tool architecture
is based on razerd, which is a background d&aelig;mon doing all of the
low-level privileged hardware accesses. The user interface tools are
razercfg, a command-line tool; and qrazercfg, a Qt4-based graphical
device configuration tool.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, according to its Freshmeat entry:
&ldquo;Supported devices are the Razer DeathAdder mouse, the Razer Krait mouse,
the Razer Lachesis mouse, the Razer Copperhead mouse and the Razer
Naga mouse.&rdquo;

GAdmin-Antivirus</b></span> (<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gadmin-antivirus" target="_self">freshmeat.net/projects/gadmin-antivirus</a>)
</p><p>
I've always been put off by Clam antivirus's command-line interface (I
just don't get it), so a GUI front end would be brilliant. Thankfully, it
seems numerous front ends exist, and hopefully, I can cover one or two in
the coming months. Details on <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> project, however, are scarce,
although I'd like to try it anyway. According to its Freshmeat entry:
&ldquo;GAdmin-Antivirus is a fast-and-easy to use GTK+ front end for Clam
antivirus. Multiple scan sets can be scheduled to run at specific times
via cron. Each of these scan sets can contain multiple directories to
be scanned.&rdquo;
