The user interface is progressing quickly these days. It has been
15 years since cool 3-D buttons and the like, as popularized by Windows 95 and
other early windowing environments, emerged. Now, we see halo effects, shades,
transparency and more&mdash;all hardware-accelerated, and all making our computers
look better than ever.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x2916250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A consequence of Nokia's acquisition of Trolltech, a lot of attention
has been paid to Qt's abilities in the mobile device space. This not
only means speed optimizations and support for more platforms, such as
Symbian (and Android, if you look at community efforts), but it also means
that what the Nokians refer to as device user interfaces receive quite
a lot of attention.
</p><p>
A device user interface is basically a look and feel that integrates
well with the device on which it is used. It also provides what 
modern consumers expect: fluid transitions, graphical effects and a
polished look. The consequence of this is a move from a widget-based
user interface to a scene-based one.
</p><p>
Qt still supports widgets, and many, if not most, applications still
use them. As a matter of fact, new user interfaces are run in a
specific widget&mdash;QGraphicsView. QGraphicsView, in turn, shows a
QGraphicsScene, which contains QGraphicsItem instances. All of this 
then is managed by Qt Quick.
</p><p>
The Qt Quick concept consists of two parts. The first is the QML language,
used to build Qt Quick user interfaces. The other is the QtDeclarative
module that provides the means to execute QML components and integrate
them with C++ code.
</p><p>
The reason for developing QML was that creating fluid user interfaces
with C++ is becoming increasingly complex. By designing a language
specifically for the task of doing that, the work effort needed is
greatly reduced. This is done in a fashion so that Qt and C++ still can
be used for their strong points, by implementing the user interface using
QML and the business logic and parts requiring performance in C++. As
a side effect, the always-wanted split of user interface code and the
rest of the application is enforced, as the parts are implemented using
different languages.
</p><p>
To understand how Qt Quick can be used, let's look at three
aspects. First, QML in general, then how QML is used to build dynamic
user interfaces and finally, how QML and C++ fit together.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x2916618"></a>
Introduction to QML</h2></div></div><p>
QML is a declarative language, based on JavaScript. It is based on
the concepts of components that are declared and properties that are
bound. A simple example of this is an empty, rectangular scene:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import Qt 4.7

Rectangle {
    id: theRect

    width: 400
    height: width*1.5
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In this snippet, the component Rectangle is instantiated. All words
starting with an uppercase letter instantiate components. In the
rectangle declaration, three properties are bound to values. The id
property is special; it names items. In the future, the rectangle can
be referenced as theRect. To access a property of the rectangle,
such as its width, theRect.width can be used.
</p><p>
Next, the width is bound to the value 400, and the height is bound to
the width times 1.5. Notice that the height is bound to width*1.5 and
not assigned to the result of the multiplication. This means if
the width changes, the height is updated automatically.
</p><p>
It also is worth noting the first line, which imports all components that
are part of Qt version 4.7. This imports a set of components, such as
the rectangle class, defined and implemented using C++. It is possible
to import more C++-based components, components written in QML or entire
modules of QML components.
</p><p>
I won't go into details on QML components here. Basically, a
component is the contents of a given qml source file. Having
imported a file named Foo.qml, its contents can be instantiated as Foo
{ ... }. A module is a directory containing components. Importing a
module simply means importing all components of a directory. A really
cool feature is that a module can be loaded from a remote location over
the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x2916930"></a>
States and Transitions</h2></div></div><p>
One concept that is heavily integrated into QML is states and
transitions between states. The Qt 4.6 release saw the introduction of the C++ classes
for supporting this. However, with QML, using
states and transitions is a natural thing.
</p><p>
The source code shown in Listing 1 demonstrates a number of QML
concepts. First is the example of how to declare
a hierarchy of items. The scene rectangle contains the red and blue
rectangles. The red rectangle, in turn, contains a text item and a mouse
area item.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x2916ae8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. States and Transitions</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
import Qt 4.7

Rectangle {
  width: 300; height: 150
  id: scene

  Rectangle {
    id: red
    x: 50; y: 50
    width: 50; height: 50
    color: "red"

    Text {
      anchors.centerIn: parent
      text: "Red"
    }

    MouseArea {
      anchors.fill: parent
      onClicked: {
        if(scene.state == "redFocus")
          scene.state="";
        else
          scene.state = "redFocus";
      }
    }
  }

  Rectangle {
    id: blue
    x: 200; y: 50
    width: 50; height: 50
    color: "blue"

    MouseArea {
      anchors.fill: parent
      onClicked: {
        if(scene.state == "blueFocus")
          scene.state="";
        else
          scene.state = "blueFocus";
      }
    }
  }

  Text {
    anchors.centerIn: blue
    text: "Blue"
  }

  states: [
    State {
      name: "redFocus"
      PropertyChanges { target: red; scale: 2.5 }
      PropertyChanges { target: blue; rotation: 30 }
    },

    State {
      name: "blueFocus"
      PropertyChanges { target: red; rotation: 30 }
      PropertyChanges { target: blue; scale: 2.5 }
    }
  ]

  transitions: [
    Transition {
      NumberAnimation { properties: "scale";
        duration: 2000; easing.type: Easing.OutBounce }
      NumberAnimation { properties: "rotation";
        duration: 750; easing.type: Easing.InOutCubic }
    }
  ]
}
</pre></div><p>
The text item in the red rectangle demonstrates another feature: anchor
layouts. Items can be anchored to each other, either to their sides or their
center lines. The anchors can be offset using margins, and different items
can be used for anchoring different parts of the same item. Basically,
all your layout needs should be covered by anchor layouts. In this
specific example, the center of the text is anchored to the center of
the parent rectangle.
</p><p>
Further down, another text item is declared. This time, it is centered
in the blue rectangle. Notice that the text item does not have to be a
child of the item on which it is centered. This will have implications later on.
</p><p>
Moving on in the red rectangle, we reach the mouse area. This is
another concept in QML&mdash;interactive areas are not mapped tightly to
the visuals. A mouse area is used to interact with mouse events. Think of
it
as an invisible rectangle that can be anchored to other items,
just as a visual item.
</p><p>
In the mouse area, the onClicked signal is bound to a piece of
JavaScript. In this case, it alters the state property of the scene
item. This brings us to the states and transitions.
</p><p>
Items in QML have a list of states and a list of transitions. In
the example, the states' list contains two states: redFocus and
blueFocus. Each state contains a number of PropertyChange items. These
items modify properties of target items. In the case of redFocus, the
scale of the red item and the rotation of the blue item are changed. Other
items can be used in states&mdash;for instance, ParentChange
moves items in the item hierarchy.
</p><p>
Looking back on the JavaScript bound to the onClicked event, the change
of the state property moves between the states listed in the states
property. When the state is set to an empty string, the default state
is used. This means all properties are set to their initial,
unaltered values.
</p><p>
The final piece of the puzzle is the transitions property, which is a list
of behaviors for value changes of different properties. It is possible
to control each individual property for each item for each transition
direction. In the example, however, we control only each property for all
items and all transitions. The NumberAnimation items control how long
each change takes and how the change is made. The scale bounces while
the rotation accelerates and decelerates according to a cubic curve,
forming a smooth motion.
</p><p>
Looking at the screenshots in Figure 1, you can see the difference
between the two texts. In the case of the red rectangle, the text is a
child of the rectangle. This means the rotation and scaling of the
rectangle is applied to the text too. In the case of the blue rectangle,
the text simply stays centered. It is not affected by the transformations
applied to the rectangle, because it is now a child of it.

Models and Views</h2></div></div><p>
When building user interfaces, a common scenario is to show a list of
data. As you already have guessed, QML provides support for this as
well. Listing 2 shows how this can be used.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x2917698"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. A List View</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
import Qt 4.7

Rectangle {
  width: 200; height: 200

  ListModel {
    id: countries

    ListElement {
      name: "Denmark"; capital: "Copenhagen"
    }

    ...

    ListElement {
      name: "Sweden"; capital: "Stockholm"
    }
  }

  Component {
    id: countryDelegate

    Item {
      width: listView.width; height: 50

      MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: { listView.currentIndex = index; }
      }

      Rectangle {
        x: 3; y: 3
        width: parent.width-6
        height: parent.height-6

        color: listView.currentIndex==index?"white":"lightgray"
        radius: 8

        Column {

            color: "#444444"; text: name
          }
          Text {
            font.italic: true; font.pixelSize: 10
            color: "#666666"; text: capital
  } } } } }

  Component {
    id: highlightFrame

    Item {
      width: listView.width; height: 50;
      y: listView.currentItem.y
      Rectangle {
        x: 3; y: 3
        width: parent.width-6
        height: parent.height-6
        radius: 8
        border.width: 4; border.color: "darkGray"
      }
    }
  }

  ListView {
    id: listView
    anchors.fill: parent
    model: countries
    delegate: countryDelegate
    highlight: highlightFrame
    focus: true
    highlightFollowsCurrentItem: true
  }
}
</pre></div><p>
The example in Listing 2 consists of four major parts: the countries model, the
countryDelegate component, the highlightFrame component and the ListView
item, which puts it all together. Starting from the bottom, the list view
item refers to a model, a delegate and a highlight. These are the model
and components implemented earlier. In addition to this, some tuning of
the view's behavior is needed to allow keyboard navigation in parallel
with mouse navigation.
</p><p>
Returning to the top of the example, the model is a ListModel containing
a set of ListElement items. The properties of the list elements are
made available through the view, as you can see if you continue into the
countryDelegate component and its text items.
</p><p>
The countryDelegate component is what the list view uses to visualize
each item of the list. It consists of a mouse area and a rectangle with
two texts in it. The mouse area sets the current item of the list if an
item is clicked, while the texts show the data of the model. Notice that
the text property of the items is bound to the property names used in
the list elements of the model. This makes it easy to tie items in a
delegate to model data.
</p><p>
Let's continue to the highlightFrame component. This is a frame that the
view places over the current item. In this case, it adds a border to the
item. The countryDelegate changes its own background color if it is
the current item. This is because the current item is shown without a
background color instead of with one. That is not possible to achieve
using only a highlight frame.
</p><p>
Finally, the list view puts it all together. The result is shown in Figure 2.

The QML Runtime</h2></div></div><p>
It is common to rely on the QML viewer tool when developing QML
applications. It also is common to use QML for populating models with
data, be it phony or real data. Most state management and work also can be
carried out from QML with the aid of JavaScript. However, in most cases,
a native application is needed as the runtime environment for any QML
application. This is where the QtDeclarative module enters the picture.
</p><p>
For readers who are familiar with Qt, it is good to know that QML
consists of a language engine, a context for the scripts to execute in and
a QGraphicsScene to operate inside. All these components can be set up
manually&mdash;it even is possible to add QML components to an existing
scene. This way, you can upgrade an existing application gradually.
</p><p>
If you start from scratch with a QML application, the QDeclarativeView
encapsulates all these components into a single class, which also happens
to be a widget. For an application relying only on QML for its user
interface, this is all that it takes.
</p><p>
To integrate C++ objects into QML, the QObject meta-system is used. This
means that any QObject-derived class can be exposed to QML. From QML,
properties, signals and slots will be available. As QML properties are
bound to values, rather than assigned, any changes in the C++ part of
the application is reflected automatically in the QML part.
</p><p>
It is beyond the scope of this article to go into details on this, but
in the first example, the state could have been driven from C++. This
would have let QML handle what it is good at: visuals and dynamic
transitions. In the second example, a typical application would provide
the model from C++&mdash;again, letting QML focus on the visuals.
</p><p>
This approach has a number of benefits.
The first one is that
the user interface is created quickly using QML as the whole language
is focused on that goal. The other is that you are forced to maintain a clear
division between the user interface and the rest of the application. This
leads to more structure and better code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x290e768"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
Looking at the future of Qt Quick, many things may happen. In MeeGo, the
MeeGo touch initiative is implementing new widgets using Qt Quick. In
KDE, Plasma is supporting Qt Quick. One effect of this is that you can
write Plasmoids using QML. In the Qt tooling department, the trolls
are working on a visual designer for Qt Quick. It already has a few
interesting features&mdash;for instance, layers can be imported from GIMP
and Photoshop directly into the designer.
</p><p>
Looking at Qt, I don't think we have seen the last widget-based
application yet. Actually, when creating serious software for serious
tasks, I see no reason not to use widgets. However, with the new focus on
mobile, not only within the old Trolltech, but the entire Linux community,
I think that Qt Quick will be a very frequently used tool.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x290e8c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Getting Started with Qt Quick</b></p><p>
As Qt 4.7 recently was released, Qt Quick is becoming available
through the repositories of most distributions. Some distributions
choose to package Qt in several packages, so make sure you get
the Qt development package, the Qt Creator package and all Qt modules,
especially those referencing to Qt declarative. In the Linux world,
I recommend you use the facilities provided by your distribution to
install and maintain your software. However, for those of you needing
a particular version of the Qt tools, or if you are using a distribution
that doesn't include Qt, you can download the Qt SDK from Nokia's Web site.
</p><p>
The package that you want is the Qt SDK, available from
<a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads" target="_self">qt.nokia.com/downloads</a>. Simply download the file,
<tt  >chmod</tt> it to
make it executable and run the installer. You can install it in your home
directory if you do not have root access. The SDK includes tools, demos,
sources and documentation, all in one convenient package. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x281e580.0x290ebe0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Limitations of Widgets</b></p><p>
There are a number of limitations imposed from building user interfaces
with widgets that are addressed when switching to a graphics view-based
approach. One obvious limitation is that widgets are rectangular
and like to be arranged side by side, which makes it hard to arrange
non-rectangular items in a good manner.
</p><p>
Another limitation is that widgets clip their children, which means
children cannot extend outside their parent widget. Take a simple
effect, such as having parts of a user interface explode. In that case, clipping
is a limiting factor.
</p><p>
Another feature that widget-based systems usually do not support
is sub-pixel resolution for item dimensions and placement. Also,
transformations, such as scaling and rotation, are not supported by
widgets. In a scene, all these features can be used to achieve the best
possible visual experience.
</p><p>
Taking transformations over time, it becomes obvious that widgets are not
meant to slide, bounce or generally move about. They are designed to be
arranged in layouts based on grids, columns and rows, and they provide users
with a standardized, structured user interface. This is very good when the
user is using the computer as a computer. When the user is using a device,
this type of computer interface is not the most appropriate solution.
