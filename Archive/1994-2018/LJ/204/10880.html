The award for the hottest new server Web development language goes to...JavaScript! JavaScript, language of the browser since the early days, is
the hottest language for server-side development. See why JavaScript is the
language for developing quick, easy and incredibly powerful server-side
applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d82a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For years, Douglas Crockford, the high priest of JavaScript (JS), has
claimed that it is a powerful, flexible language suited to a multitude
of tasks, especially if you can separate it from the ugly browser-side
piece that is the Document Object Model, or DOM. Because of the browser,
JavaScript is the most popular programming language around by number of
users. Job sites dice.com and monster.com post more jobs for JavaScript
than any other language, except Java. Of course, if JavaScript runs in
a browser, or anywhere, it must have an engine. Those engines have been
around since the earliest JS-capable browsers, and they have been available as
separate standalone entities for several years. Thus, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span>
for running JS on its own always has been available. However, JavaScript
always has missed two critical elements to make it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>worthwhile</em></span>
to run on the server side.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d8510"></a>
Free Trade Agreement</h2></div></div><p>
The first missing piece was a common set of libraries. Quite simply,
because JS was so focused on the browser, it was missing basic I/O
libraries, such as file reading and writing, network port creation and
listening, and other elements that can be found in any decent standalone
language. Ruby includes them natively; Java includes them in its java.io
and java.net packages. For JavaScript, running alone when all you can do
is process text and data structures, but not communicate with the outside
world, was rather useless. Over the years, several attempts have been
made to make some form of JS I/O and Net packages, mostly wrapped around
native C calls, if the JS engine was written in C, such as SpiderMonkey,
or java.io, and java.net calls, if the JS engine was written in Java,
for example, Rhino.
</p><p>
This began to change in early 2009 with the creation of the CommonJS
Project (which, for some mystical reason, stands for Common JavaScript),
which unified these efforts under a common namespace, with JS-specific
semantics and included a package-inclusion system to boot.
</p><p>
Using Rhino as an example, you could read from a file using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
defineClass("File");
var f = new File("myfile.txt"), line;
while ((line = f.readLine()) !== null) {
   // do some processing
}

// this example slightly modified and simplified 
// from the Mozilla Rhino site
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, this is not file processing in JavaScript; it is
file processing in Java! All I have done is opened the Java API to
JavaScript. It is great if you really intend to program in Java, but
it's of limited help if you are trying to do pure JS, and especially if your
engine is not Java-based.
</p><p>
With CommonJS, there emerged a standard JavaScript-native interface to
include a package, for example an I/O package or http package, and define many
of the standard functionalities. Under the covers, the implementation
may be C, Java, Erlang or Gobbledygook. All that matters is that the
interface to the developer is platform-agnostic and portable from one
interpreter to another.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d8828"></a>
The Missing Node</h2></div></div><p>
The second missing piece was a server, similar either to Tomcat/Jetty
for Java or Mongrel/Thin for Ruby, that provides a real environment,
includes the necessary modules and is easy to use. Most important, it
needed to take advantage of JavaScript's strengths, rather than attempt
to copy a system that works for Java or Ruby. The real breakthrough was
Ryan Dahl's Node.JS. Ryan combined Google's highly performant V8 engine,
JavaScript's natural asynchronous semantics, a module system and the
basic modules to create a server that suits JavaScript to a tee.
</p><p>
Most Web servers have a primary process that receives each new request. It
then either forks a new process to handle the specific request, while the
parent listens for more requests, or creates a new thread to do the same,
essentially the same method if somewhat more efficient. The problem with
processes or threads is threefold. First, they require significant
resource usage (memory and CPU) for a small amount of differing
code. Second, these threads often will block on various activities, such
as filesystem or network access, tying up precious resources. Finally,
threads and processes require context switches in the CPU. As good as
modern operating systems are, context switches still are expensive.
</p><p>
The alternative, gaining in popularity, is event-driven, asynchronous
callbacks. In an event model, everything runs in one thread. However,
each request does not have its own thread. Rather, each request has a
callback that is invoked when an event&mdash;like a new connection
request&mdash;occurs. Several products already take advantage of the event-driven
model. Nginx is a Web server with similar CPU utilization characteristics
to dominant Apache, but with constant memory usage, no matter how many
simultaneous requests it serves. The same model has been taken to Ruby
using EventMachine.
</p><p>
As anyone who has programmed in JavaScript, and especially in
asynchronous AJAX, knows, JS is extremely well suited to event-driven
programming. Node.JS brilliantly combines packaging and an asynchronous
event-driven model with a first-rate JS engine to create an incredibly
lightweight, easy-to-use yet powerful server-side engine. Node has been
in existence for less than two years and was first released to
the world at large only at the end of May 2009, yet it has seen widespread
adoption and has served as a catalyst for many other frameworks and
projects. Quite simply, Node changes the way we write high-performance
server-side nodes (pun intended) and opens up a whole new vista.
</p><p>
The rest of this article explores installing Node and creating two
sample applications. One is the classic &ldquo;hello world&rdquo;, a starting point for
every programming example, and the other is a simple static file Web
server. More complex applications, Node-based development frameworks,
package managers for Node, available hosting environments and how to
host your own Node environment, will be subjects for future articles.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d8b40"></a>
Installing Node</h2></div></div><p>
Node will install on almost any platform, but it is ideally suited to
UNIX-like environments, such as Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X. It can be
installed on Windows, using Cygwin, but it is not as easy as the other
platforms and there are plenty of gotchas. Like most server-side packages,
if you want to do anything serious, do it on UNIX/Linux/BSD.
</p><p>
On Linux or UNIX, installation follows typical UNIX program installation:
download, configure, make, make install.
</p><p>
First, download the latest package. At the time of this writing, the latest unstable
version is 0.3.2, and the latest stable is 0.2.5. I recommend moving
toward 0.3+ as soon as possible. Don't be fooled by the low version
numbers; plenty of production sites are using Node right now for at
least part of their environment, including github.com.
</p><p>
You can download the tarball directly from <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_self">nodejs.org</a>, or clone the github
repository, my preferred method. If you don't have git installed already,
do so via your preferred package manager or directly. Before you get
started, make sure you have the prerequisites. Although I could include them
here, the details of building git are beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
On Mac OS X:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# install XCode from the Apple developer Web site
$ brew install git
</pre>
</p><p>
On Linux or similar with the apt packaging system:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install g++ curl libssl-dev apache2-utils
$ sudo apt-get install git-core
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you are ready to download, compile and install Node. First, you
need to <tt  >cd</tt> to the appropriate directory. At that point, clone the git
repository:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone git://github.com/ry/node.git
# if you have problems with git protocol, http works fine
$ git clone http://github.com/ry/node.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, make sure you are in the right version. Because git clones the entire
repository, make sure you switch to the correct version:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cd node
$ git checkout &lt;version&gt;
# version can be whichever you want, 
# but I recommend v0.3.2 as of this writing

</pre>
</p><p>
Then, run <tt  >configure</tt>. As usual, configure will check
whether you have all of the
prerequisites installed. Configure also will determine where to install
Node when it is ready. Unless you are working on a production machine,
I highly recommend installing Node in a local writable repository
under your home directory, such as ~/local/. Installing git in the
default /usr/local/bin/ leads to all sorts of interesting permission
issues when installing packages and running everything as sudo during
installs. Unless it is going to be shared among everyone and used in
production, installation makes a lot more sense in your own directory. It
is also quite small. The entire installation on my laptop, including
binaries, man pages and several add-on packages, is less than 50MB. The Node
binary itself is less than 5MB:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# installing in the default
$ ./configure

# installing in your own local directory, 
# my preferred method
$ ./configure --prefix=~/local
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, compile and install:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
$ make install
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, Node is installed and ready to run. If you installed
Node in ~/local/, you need to add ~/local/bin to your path, which
depends on your shell.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d9380"></a>
A New Mindset</h2></div></div><p>
The critical thing to remember about Node development is that everything
important is asynchronous. Sure, you could do many things synchronously,
but why would you?
</p><p>
For example, a traditional Web programming model might look something like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
// pseudo-code
conn = connection.waitForRequest();
if (conn != null) {
   request = conn.getRequest();
   response = conn.getResponse();
   data = database.getData(query);
   response.write(someData);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In asynchronous Node, you would do something more like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server.handleRequest(function(request,response) {
   // we need some data from the database
   database.submitQuery(query,function(data) {
      response.write(data);
   });
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how everything is in callbacks, an event-driven asynchronous model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x20d9698"></a>
Sample Program One: Hello World</h2></div></div><p>
Everything starts with hello world. This example 
demonstrates the basics of modules and asynchronous handling of requests.
</p><p>
First, include the necessary http module:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var http = require('http');
</pre>
</p><p>
http is a standard module included with Node. If you wanted a module that
was not in the standard path, you would preface it with
<tt  >./</tt>, which is
executed relative to the path in which the app is running. For example,
<tt  >require("./mymodule");</tt>.
</p><p>
Next, create the server, which is as simple as
<tt  >createServer()</tt>, as well
as the callback function to handle each request:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http.createServer( function(request, response) {
   // handling code here
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, put in the handling code. You know you want the response to be hello
world and the http status code to be 200, which is basic success:


<pre     class="programlisting">
http.createServer( function(request, response) {
   // set your status code to 200 and content to plain text, 
   // since "hello, world!" is as plain as it gets
   response.writeHead(200,{"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
   // write out our content
   response.write("Hello, world!\n");
   // indicate that we are done
   response.end();
});
</pre>
</p><p>
The above is a callback function. It will be called each and every time
a new connection request comes in.
</p><p>
Finally, you need to tell the server to listen and on which port. For now,
let's put it on 8080 (just to annoy Tomcat):

<pre     class="programlisting">
http.createServer( callbackFunction ).listen(8080);
</pre>
</p><p>
Pulling it all together, you get a very simple program:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var http = require('http');
http.createServer( function(request, response) {
   // set your status code to 200 and content to plain text, 
   // since "hello, world!" is as plain as it gets
   response.writeHead(200,{"Content-Type": "text/plain"});
   // write out our content
   response.write("Hello, world!\n");
   // indicate that we are done
   response.end();
}).listen(8080);
</pre>
</p><p>
Six lines of code, and a functioning Web server that says &ldquo;Hello,
world!&rdquo;
Save the file as app.js, and then run it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd to your development directory
$ cd workingdir
$ node ./app.js
</pre>
</p><p>
Connect your browser to http://localhost:8080, or use curl or wget,
and you will see &ldquo;Hello, world!&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe0580.0x24d2180"></a>
Sample Program Two: Simple File Server</h2></div></div><p>
For the next example, let's serve up files from the local filesystem. If
the file is available in the document root, let's return it with
a 200 response; if it is not, let's return a 404 status code and an
error message.
</p><p>
Like last time, you need the http module. Unlike last time, you also need the
modules to read from the filesystem, and an ability to process URLs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var http = require('http'), fs = require('fs'), 
 &#8618;path = require('path'), url = require('url');
</pre>
</p><p>
Create the server and its handler, and listen on port 8080 (just to
annoy Tomcat) in the same way as last time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http.createServer( function(request, response) {
   // handling code
}).listen(8080);
</pre>
</p><p>
The difference is in the handling code. Now, when you get a request, you want
to see whether it exists in the filesystem, and if so, return it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
http.createServer( function(request, response) {
   // __dirname is a special variable set by node
   var file = __dirname+path;
   // check if the requested path exists
   path.exists(file, function(exists) {
     if (exists) {
     } else {
     });
   });
}).listen(8080);
</pre>
</p><p>
You use the path module to check whether the file is available, but you do it
asynchronously. Normally, file access is very slow, and everything in the
thread or process will block. With Node's event-driven model, nothing
blocks; rather, the system continues to move and calls the function(exists)
callback when it has an answer if the file exists.
</p><p>
If the file does exist, you need to read it using the &ldquo;file&rdquo; module and send
it back. If it doesn't, you send back a 404 error. First, let's look at the
simple file-not-found case:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if (exists) {
   // do some handling
} else {
   response.writeHead(404, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"}); 
   response.write("404 Not Found\n");  
   response.end();  
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's look at reading the file and sending it back when it does exist.
Once again, read the file asynchronously:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if (exists) {
   // read the file asynchronously
   fs.readFile(file,"binary",function(err,file) {
      if (err) {
         // we got some kind of error, report it
         response.writeHead(500,{"Content-Type":"text/plain"});
         response.write(err+"\n");
         response.end();
      } else {
         response.writeHead(200,{"Content-Type":"text/html"});
         response.write(file,"binary");
         response.end();
      }
   });
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Tying it all together and cleaning it up a bit, you get a nice tidy,
asynchronous, event-driven Web file server:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var http = require('http'), fs = require('fs'), 
 &#8618;path = require('path'), url = require('url');
http.createServer( function(request, response) {
   var file = __dirname+url.parse('url').pathname;
   // check if the requested path exists
   path.exists(file, function(exists) {
      if (exists) {
         fs.readFile(file,"binary",function(err,file) {
            if (err) {
               response.writeHead(500,{"Content-Type":"text/plain"});
               response.write(err+"\n");
               response.end();
            } else {
               response.writeHead(200,{"Content-Type":"text/html"});
               response.write(file,"binary");
               response.end();
            }
         });
      } else {
         response.writeHead(404, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"});  
         response.write("404 Not Found\n");  
         response.end();  
      }
   });
}).listen(8080);
</pre>
</p><p>
A static Web file server, which will outperform most such servers on the
market, in just 23 lines of code&mdash;it's a work of Art.
