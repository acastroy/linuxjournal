Donald E. Knuth's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Computer Programming</em></span>, Volumes
1&ndash;4A Box Set, 3rd ed. (Addison-Wesley)</h2></div></div><p>
Donald E. Knuth's monumental book series <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Computer
Programming</em></span> has
deep roots. When the distinguished Stanford Professor Emeritus Knuth
began putting his ideas to paper, John F. Kennedy was president, Don
Draper was Madison Avenue's hottest ad man, and most of us were merely
potential zygotes. Publisher Addison-Wesley says that the first three
volumes of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Art of Computer Programming</em></span> are &ldquo;widely recognized as the
definitive description of classical computer science&rdquo;. Practicing
programmers have long applied his &ldquo;cookbook&rdquo; solutions to their
day-to-day problems. Now comes the long-awaited fourth volume to compose
a new four-volume set. The new volume 4 brings together definitive new
coverage of broadword computation, combinatorial generation, fundamental
combinatorial objects and other topics. Bill Gates has said that people
who read the entire set should send him their r&eacute;sum&eacute;. If you get that
far, we imagine Linus would love to see it too!

OpenERP</h2></div></div><p>
The OpenERP open-source suite of comprehensive business applications
recently bounded up to version 6.0. OpenERP's eponymous developer
noted that a number of factors warranted the release's designation,
including advancement in simplicity and ease of deployment, the ability
to build an ERP system at one's own pace, greatly improved affordability
and accessibility for companies of all sizes, and more than 800 contributions
from its global community of open-source developers. Further, OpenERP
v6 now is available not only as an on-site version, but also as
an SaaS platform, which the firm says &ldquo;radically reduces the cost and
complexity of an ERP deployment&rdquo;. Some of the hundreds of additional
new features include extended multicompany functionality marketing
campaign management, simplified accounting interface, tracking of tickets
for support and after-sales services, push and pulled logistics flows,
talent acquisition and manufacturing scrap management.

GrammaTech's CodeSonar</h2></div></div><p>
The developers at GrammaTech have released a fresh new version 3.6 of
CodeSonar, a source code analysis tool that performs a whole-program,
interprocedural analysis on code and identifies complex programming bugs.
Version 3.6 adds two significant improvements, namely a significantly
improved GUI, which streamlines developer interaction and boosts
productivity, as well as a more efficient analysis engine, which can
reduce analysis time on large code bases, says GrammaTech, by up to
a third. GrammaTech also says that CodeSonar's unique strength
is &ldquo;its ability to identify far more program-crashing defects and
security vulnerabilities than competing static-analysis tools&rdquo;. Another
advantage is CodeSonar's new GUI that &ldquo;enables developers to quickly
digest key information, understand and identify the most important
issues and prioritize fixes&rdquo;. CodeSonar runs on Linux, Solaris,
Windows and Mac OS X operating systems and supports most compilers.
