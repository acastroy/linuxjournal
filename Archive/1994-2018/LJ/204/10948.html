How does the Boxee Box stack up as a living-room entertainment unit?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1671580.0x1769300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When it comes to software battles, the Open Source community has its
fair share. KDE vs. GNOME, vi vs. Emacs, Firefox vs. Chromium&mdash;there
seems to be countless rivalries. In my house, one of the biggest
rivalries is between XBMC and Boxee. This month, I take a look at Boxee,
specifically the Boxee Box from D-Link.
</p><p>
Although Boxee itself is a software package, competing with software
like XBMC, Front Row, Plex, MythTV, GeeXboX and so on, the Boxee Box is a
hardware device competing directly against things like the Roku, AppleTV
and GoogleTV. When compared to the other hardware options out there,
it really does shine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1671580.0x1769510"></a>
What's in the Box's Box?</h2></div></div><p>
The most noticeable physical feature of the Boxee Box is its odd
melted-ice-cube shape (Figure 1). It looks like someone took a cube and
put a corner of it on a hot surface to make it melt. I'm sure it's very artsy,
and I've read that it efficiently manages the cables in the rear. But
for me, it annoyingly doesn't stack anywhere in my entertainment center.
I know creative-yet-impractical designs work well for some companies,
but I'm of the opinion that square
is good. I'm often called a square, and it works for me&mdash;but I
digress.
It's a design choice and really doesn't affect my opinion that much.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10948f1.large.jpg"><img src="10948f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Boxee Box is remarkably not boxy. It is shaped like a cube
that someone modified with a belt sander.
</p></div></div><p>
In contrast to the Box's design, the remote control is a thing of
beauty. It's like the mullet of remote controls&mdash;business
on the front and party on the back. The top side has a very simplistic
button design (much like an Apple remote to be honest). The flip side
of the remote has a complete qwerty keyboard. It's not something you'd
want to write the Great American Novel with, but it fares about as
well as a cell-phone keyboard does (more on the keyboard later).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10948f2.large.jpg"><img src="10948f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. I love the idea of the double-sided remote. Apart from a few
nagging issues, it's perfect.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see on the back of the Boxee Box in Figure 3, this unit is
designed for high-definition (HD) systems. The only video output option
is HDMI. Thankfully, there are both optical and analog audio outputs
to go along with the HDMI audio, but if you have a television without
HDMI support, you'll need to be creative with adapters and such.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10948f3.large.jpg"><img src="10948f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The ports are easily accessible in spite of the weird angle.
</p></div></div><p>
The unit also has some USB ports in the back and an SD card slot on
the side&mdash;or perhaps the SD card slot is on the top. With the melted-ice-cube design, it's really hard to determine what's considered up.
Add to that a wall-wart power supply, and you have the contents of the
Boxee Box's Box.

Box Guts</h2></div></div><p>
Because the Boxee Box is an appliance, the internal hardware isn't really
as important as what it does, but we're all geeks here, so this part
is interesting if nothing else. Originally, the Boxee Box was going
to use the NVIDIA Tegra2 for video playback. In a last-minute switch,
however, the Boxee team went with the Intel CE 4100 and a PowerVR GPU.
The Boxee team is confident with its decision, and as long as it
performs well, the end user really doesn't interact with the guts anyway.
The Box boasts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Atom processor, at 1.2GHz.
</p></li><li><p>
PowerVR SGX535 graphics processor.
</p></li><li><p>

1GB NAND Flash memory.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Composite (RCA) audio.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1671580.0x176a640"></a>
The Two-Faced Remote</h2></div></div><p>
The remote that comes with the Boxee Box is really a perfect addition to
an entertainment device into which you occasionally need to type. Those of us
who have typed on the Nintendo Wii's on-screen keyboards fully understand
how frustrating it can be to &ldquo;type&rdquo; with nothing more than directional
keys or a pointing device. Although the idea behind the two-sided remote is
brilliant, it does have its flaws.
</p><p>
The simplicity of the top side makes for a simple browsing experience,
but unfortunately, it's so simple (and symmetric), it's easy to grab
upside down. When you grab the remote upside down, up becomes down,
right becomes left, and because the remote uses RF instead of infrared, it
doesn't matter if the remote is facing the wrong way. When you press a
button, it registers. There is a raised logo on one side of the remote,
but it's not really clear which end is up on the logo either, so you
have to look closely to tell which is up and which is down. It's not a
terrible problem, but it's annoying at times.
</p><p>
The keyboard is rather nice for something so small. It's not too bad
to hold, and the keys give enough feedback that you can tell you're typing.
The enter and arrow keys aren't in obvious positions, so you have to
look when you're typing. That's not a big problem either, unless you
happen to be in the dark. The keys don't have any backlight, so typing
in the dark is just about impossible. Because typing isn't required for
normal operation, that's not a showstopper, but I'd like to see
future versions have some sort of illumination for the keyboard buttons.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1671580.0x176a850"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
Those familiar with the Boxee software will recognize the Boxee Box's
interface right away. There are a few big changes, but for the most part,
it is similar to the traditional Boxee experience. I'm currently using
the firmware released in mid-December 2010, which makes some significant
(and welcome) changes. The big difference in functionality (apart from
Wi-Fi working, which it did not for me out of the box) was a change in
how the Boxee Box displays media. Figure 4 shows the dialog box that
appears on boot, asking how you prefer to view media. This question is a
little confusing, as it doesn't explain what difference your choice will
make, but simply put, if you choose Local Media, the Boxee Box
defaults to showing you media stored locally as opposed to Web content.
You're still able to watch Web content, and it's not difficult to do so,
but by default, Boxee points to local media.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10948f4.large.jpg"><img src="10948f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. This dialog box just sets up the default media the Boxee Box
plays back. It doesn't hinder your ability to watch on-line content.
</p></div></div><p>
The interface is functional, but it's not always intuitive or easy to navigate.
For example, it takes a series of clicks to get back to the home screen,
with no apparent shortcut to get there quickly. The menu button
doubles as a back button, but it isn't labeled as such. Even with those
frustrations, however, the menu system isn't difficult to figure out.
I have read other reviews claiming the Boxee Box menus are sluggish, but
I've noticed that only when identifying media or making significant
system preference changes. Usually the remote and interface are quite
responsive.
</p><p>
The video playback for local media is stellar. In my 5TB file server,
I can't find a single file that won't play. Playback of 1080p MKV files
is flawless, and even Web streams are clear and watchable. (That is
likely due to my beefy Internet connection, but the Boxee renders the
Web streams well, so kudos.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1671580.0x176ac70"></a>
Third-Party Software</h2></div></div><p>
Boxee, and in turn the Boxee Box, has the ability to use
&ldquo;applications&rdquo;
in order to access other on-line services. These are almost identical
to the Roku's application system, if you are familiar with that. At the
time of this writing, many applications exist that add value to the
Boxee experience. Pandora Radio has a great interface, and many on-line
sites, such as College Humor and Revision 3, have applications that will
guide you through their catalogs. Netflix and Hulu are glaringly absent.
By the time this goes to press, hopefully both on-line services will
be available, but their absence makes the Boxee seem quite lacking,
especially if you don't have an extensive library of local media.
</p><p>
Firmware updates certainly will improve the Boxee Box as time goes on,
but the application framework is where the magic could really happen.
Third-party applications turned the Roku from a Netflix-streaming device
into a full-blown living-room entertainment unit. Because the Boxee does
(or will do shortly) all the things the Roku can do,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>plus</em></span> plays any local
media you throw at it, it's really positioned to be the perfect set-top box.

Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
The Boxee Box, like its software-only counterpart, Boxee, takes a
different approach to media from XBMC. Where XBMC is fast, clean and
elegant in its simplicity, Boxee does everything it can to immerse 
users into a multimedia universe. XBMC plays media, whereas Boxee is an
entertainment system. Even after taking the Boxee Box through its paces,
I'm not convinced one is better than the other. They're just different.
At $199, the Boxee Box is an affordable way to get an extremely
robust media center. Although I have XBMC on a $199 nettop device,
and it runs fine, the integration of specialized hardware is hard
to beat. I heartily recommend the Boxee Box for anyone considering an
HD media center. Although the unit I reviewed didn't have
Netflix, Hulu or even VUDU, by the time you read this, it should have
access to all three, which really will make Boxee a tough box to beat when it
comes to home entertainment.
</p><p>
My only recommendation before buying the Boxee Box is to download
the Boxee software and see if you like its interface. Granted, the
downloadable version is aesthetically different from the Box's interface,
but it's a good way to see whether you are comfortable with the Boxee way
of doing things. Some like it; some hate it. (See the Local Media, Boxee
Style sidebar for a
little more information.) It's free, so you can try it before you buy it.

Local Media, Boxee Style</b></p><p>
Boxee always has handled local media in two ways. Users can access their
filesystems directly and peruse their video collection folder by folder.
Where Boxee really shines, however, is with its media library function.
If files are named correctly (basically with the name of the movie
and year), Boxee downloads genre information, cover art, ratings
and other metadata. It's possible to browse your media collection
like you'd look through movies at the rental store.
Because Boxee downloads metadata, you even can sort your collection to
find that perfect popcorn companion. Granted, the media scraper isn't
perfect, but the Boxee Box gives you the ability to identify media it
can't figure out automatically.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10948f5.large.jpg"><img src="10948f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Boxee makes your media collection look beautiful. The initial
scanning takes a long time, but the cover art and metadata are really
nice.
