Hacking is largely a practical matter&mdash;scratching itches and all that.
But,
some hackers work in service of irony, manipulating social as well as
computer code&mdash;to effects that are equally interesting, useful and
funny. At this line of work, nobody outdoes Tim Hwang (aka @TimHwang), who
blogs as Broseph Stalin (after retiring as commissioner of the US Bureau
of Fabulous Bitches) and whose CV also includes creating and organizing
all of the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ROFLCon (&ldquo;the most epic Internet culture conference ever
assembled&rdquo;, and
it's true).
</p></li><li><p>
The Awesome Foundation for the Arts and Sciences (&ldquo;an ever-growing,
worldwide network of people devoted to forwarding the interest of
awesomeness in the universe&rdquo;).
</p></li><li><p>
The Web Ecology Project (in which he is also identified as &ldquo;an analyst with
The Barbarian Group&rdquo;&mdash;where he works on issues of group dynamics and
Web influence, adding that he &ldquo;is in the process of watching every homemade
flamethrower video on YouTube&rdquo;, the results of which were presented at SXSW
last year).
</p></li><li><p>
Robot Robot &amp; Hwang (his future law firm, currently working on
&ldquo;an open-source project to develop the legal infrastructure to allow
for large-scale
securitizing of lawsuits&rdquo;).
</p></li><li><p>
SOCIALBOTS 2011 (&ldquo;the first-ever competitive event in the large-scale
robotic influence of on-line social groups&rdquo;).
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10994f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Tim Hwang
</p></div></div><p>
I met Tim when he was a researcher at the Berkman Center and got to know
him better through ROFLCon and The Awesome Foundation (in which I now hold
a chair in the original Boston chapter). It also seemed like I ran into Tim
pretty much everywhere around the MIT-Harvard axis of Cambridge-based
social and technical hackery.
</p><p>
I still don't know where Tim went to college, though I'm guessing it was
one of the two likely suspects. (Berkman is at Harvard and ROFLCon happens
at MIT.) I never asked. From a hacking perspective, where one went to
school (or currently goes to school) is not a matter of great importance.
This is one of the things that drew me to working with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> and
hanging with hackers in the first place. The hacker ethos is a corollary to
a line on a T-shirt I used to see a lot in Los Angeles. It read, &ldquo;It isn't
who you are but how you look. After all, who cares who you are?&rdquo; Around
hackerdom, it's like, &ldquo;It isn't where you went but what you do. After all,
who cares where you went?&rdquo;
</p><p>
These days, Tim goes to UC-Berkeley, where he's a law student. What he's
doing (and presumably will do when he gets out) is work with Robot Robot
&amp;
Hwang. And, since hacking law is an activity on which at least one of my
own open-source projects depends, I'm looking forward to Tim's progress on
that front.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, my immediate interest is in SOCIALBOTS 2011, which will be over
by the time you read this. The whole &ldquo;social network&rdquo; craze drives me up a
wall. We've had &ldquo;social networks&rdquo; forever, both off-line and on. Bars,
restaurants, churches, town squares, marketplaces, caf&eacute;s, USENET, FidoNet,
SMS, blogging&mdash;all those things are no less social than Twitter and
Facebook, yet when somebody says &ldquo;social network&rdquo;, those two
things are what they
mean. Until I busted them for it, Wikipedia's entry for &ldquo;social
media&rdquo;
read:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Social media have been modernized to reach consumers through the Internet.
Social media have become appealing to big and small businesses. Credible
brands are utilizing social media to reach customers and to build or
maintain reputation. As social media continue to grow, the ability to reach
more consumers globally has also increased. Twitter, for example, has
expanded its global reach to Japan, Indonesia and Mexico, among others.
This means that brands are now able to advertise in multiple languages and
therefore reach a broader range of consumers. Social media have become the
new &ldquo;tool&rdquo; for effective business marketing and sales.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
But, while I mocked the pursuit of influence and rankings on Twitter as
&ldquo;high school with a business model&rdquo;, Tim hacked up a way to prove it, with
SOCIALBOTS 2011. The pitch:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Teams will program bots to control user accounts on Twitter in a brutal,
two-week, all-out, no-holds-barred battle to influence an unsuspecting
cluster of 500 on-line users to do their bidding. Points will be given for
connections created by the bots and the social behaviors they are able to
elicit among the targets. All code to be made open source under the MIT
license.
</p><p>
It's blood sport for Internet social science/network analysis nerds.
Winner to be rewarded $500, unending fame and glory, and THE SOCIALBOTS
CUP.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I look at this as a way of debugging Twitter, plus every other &ldquo;social
network&rdquo; (or wannabe) whose executives cringe at the results.
</p><p>
Here's betting that Tim's hack will do more good than a thousand complaints
like mine.
</p><p>
Oh, and don't forget to check <a href="http://roflcon.org" target="_self">roflcon.org</a> for details
on ROFLCon 3.
