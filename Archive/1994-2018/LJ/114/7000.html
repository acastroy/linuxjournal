Some of the kernel APIs we covered in their 2.5
form have changed a little before being nailed
down for 2.6. Here's the updated information on
the 2.6 versions.

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb3580.0x1fab1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It has been over a year since this column started, and due to
the rapid rate of Linux kernel development, much of what was
written back then is now wrong. This month, we
cover the changes in the different kernel APIs that have been
discussed previously.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb3580.0x1fab2f0"></a>tty Changes</h2></div></div><p>
The tty layer had been one of the most stable kernel APIs
around, and it showed. The lack of proper reference counting,
the locking shoved in where it looked needed and the
strange way tty devices were allocated are all due to its age.
Thankfully, Al Viro recently cleaned up a lot of the old cruft in the
tty layer in the 2.5 kernel series. Because of this, a
number of things have changed for anyone wanting to write a new
tty driver.
</p><p>
In the August and October 2002 issues of <i  >LJ</i>
[available at <a href="../100/5896.html" target="_self">/article/5896</a>
and <a href="../102/6226.html" target="_self">/article/6226</a>], we discussed the tty layer and how
to fill up the struct tty_driver structure
with all the necessary function callbacks. Since then, a new structure,
struct tty_operations, has been created to
hold all of the function callbacks. The
struct tty_driver still contains the older
function pointers, so a new function has been created to copy
these pointers over, tty_set_operations.
Hopefully, this duplication will be eliminated soon.
</p><p>
A number of variables have been removed from the
struct tty_driver. The
table, termios, termios_locked and refcount
fields are gone. The tty layer now
handles all of the proper locking and reference counting, without
forcing the individual tty drivers to allocate the space for
these locks.
</p><p>
The magic and num variables no longer need to be set explicitly
by the tty driver. These variables now are set in a new
function, alloc_tty_driver, that must be called by all tty drivers to allocate the
space for the tty driver. The number of different
tty devices this driver is going to support is passed as a
parameter to the function. For example, the tiny tty driver
introduced in the original tty articles would create
the struct tty_driver as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/* allocate the tty driver */
tiny_tty_driver = alloc_tty_driver(TINY_TTY_MINORS);

</pre>
</p><p>
In the past, picking the proper name for the tty driver was
difficult, as the devfs kernel option overloaded the use of the
name field. Christoph Hellwig finally fixed this mess by
introducing a new variable in the
struct tty_driver structure called
devfs_name. Now, the name
field should be set to a simple, small name that shows up in
the tty proc files. The devfs_name should
be set to the name that devfs uses to generate the device
node for this driver.
</p><p>
In the 2.5 kernel series, the
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT and
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT macros were declared too
racy, and almost all usage of them in the kernel was removed.
In order to do this, module reference counting was pushed a
layer higher than the original calls. This allows the kernel to
increment a module's reference count before the kernel jumps
into the module. Likewise, when the kernel is finished with the
module, it knows to decrement the count automatically.
</p><p>
This module change was done in the tty layer, so no tty driver
should contain the MOD_* macros.
Instead, an owner variable was added to the
struct tty_driver to show what module owns
the tty driver. The following line shows how to set this variable properly:

<pre     class="programlisting">

tiny_tty_driver-&gt;owner = THIS_MODULE;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb3580.0x1fab818"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This tells the tty core what module is related to this tty
driver.
</p><p>
As for these tty changes, here is how to initialize and
register a tty driver with the kernel properly:



<pre     class="programlisting">

#define TINY_TTY_MAJOR240 /* experimental range */
#define TINY_TTY_MINORS	255
                        /* use the whole major up */

static struct tty_operations serial_ops = {
    .open =       tiny_open,
    .close =      tiny_close,
    .write =      tiny_write,
    .write_room = tiny_write_room,
};

static struct tty_driver *tiny_tty_driver;

static int __init tiny_init(void)
{
    /* allocate the tty driver */
    tiny_tty_driver =
        alloc_tty_driver(TINY_TTY_MINORS);

    /* initialize the tty driver */
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;owner = THIS_MODULE;
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;driver_name = "tiny_tty";
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;name = "ttty";
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;devfs_name = "tts/ttty%d";
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;major = TINY_TTY_MAJOR,
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;type = TTY_DRIVER_TYPE_SERIAL,
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;subtype = SERIAL_TYPE_NORMAL,
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;flags =
        TTY_DRIVER_REAL_RAW | TTY_DRIVER_NO_DEVFS,
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;init_termios = tty_std_termios;
    tiny_tty_driver-&gt;init_termios.c_cflag =
        B9600 | CS8 | CREAD | HUPCL | CLOCAL;
    tty_set_operations(tiny_tty_driver, &amp;serial_ops);
    if (tty_register_driver(tiny_tty_driver)) {
       printk(KERN_ERR
              "failed to register tiny tty driver");
       return -1;
    }

    printk(KERN_INFO DRIVER_DESC " " DRIVER_VERSION);
    return 0;
}

static void __exit tiny_exit (void)
{
    tty_unregister_driver(tiny_tty_driver);
}

module_init(tiny_init);
module_exit(tiny_exit);

</pre>
</p><p>
tty callout devices also are now removed entirely from the
kernel. Any tty driver living in the 2.5 kernel tree that used
callout support has had it removed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb3580.0x1faba80"></a>Fewer ioctls</h2></div></div><p>
Along with the tty structure changes, a few tty ioctls have been
removed, specifically the
TIOCMGET,
TIOCMBIS,
TIOCMBIC and
TIOCMSET ioctls. They have been replaced
with two new function callbacks, tiocmget
and tiocmset, that have been added to the
struct tty_operations structure. These
functions are defined as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int (*tiocmget)(struct tty_struct *tty,
                struct file *file);
int (*tiocmset)(struct tty_struct *tty,
                struct file *file,
                unsigned int set,
                unsigned int clear);

</pre>
</p><p>
The tiocmget function is called when the tty
core or a user wants to know what the current line settings
are for a specific tty port. This works almost exactly like the
old TIOCMGET ioctl call did. The line status
is defined as the different MSR_* values,
but instead of being copied back into user space, as the old
ioctl required the driver to do, they merely are returned from
the function call. Here's an example of how a
tiocmget function could look:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int
tiny_tiocmget(struct tty_struct *tty,
              struct file *file)
{
    struct tiny_private *tp = tty-&gt;private;
    unsigned int msr = tp-&gt;msr;
    unsigned int mcr = tp-&gt;mcr;
    unsigned int result = 0;

    result = ((mcr &amp; MCR_DTR)    ? TIOCM_DTR: 0)
                                    /* DTR is set */
              | ((mcr &amp; MCR_RTS) ? TIOCM_RTS: 0)
                                    /* RTS is set */
              | ((msr &amp; MSR_CTS) ? TIOCM_CTS: 0)
                                    /* CTS is set */
              | ((msr &amp; MSR_CD)  ? TIOCM_CAR: 0)
                         /* Carrier detect is set */
              | ((msr &amp; MSR_RI)  ? TIOCM_RI:  0)
                         /* Ring Indicator is set */
              | ((msr &amp; MSR_DSR) ? TIOCM_DSR: 0);
                                    /* DSR is set */

    return result;

</pre>
</p><p>
The tiocmset function is called when the tty
core or a user wants to set or clear any of the different line
settings. This single function replaces the
TIOCMBIS,
TIOCMBIC and
TIOCMSET ioctl calls. The
set and clear variables in
this function are used to tell which line settings to set and
which to clear. The same line setting cannot be asked to be
cleared and set at the same time, so the order in which variables are
processed does not matter. An example of the
tiocmset function is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int
tiny_tiocmset(struct tty_struct *tty,
              struct file *file,
              unsigned int set, unsigned int clear)
{
    struct tiny_private *tp = tty-&gt;private;

    if (set &amp; TIOCM_RTS)
        mcr |= MCR_RTS;
    if (set &amp; TIOCM_DTR)
        mcr |= MCR_RTS;
    if (set &amp; TIOCM_LOOP)
        mcr |= MCR_LOOPBACK;

    if (clear &amp; TIOCM_RTS)
        mcr &amp;= ~MCR_RTS;
    if (clear &amp; TIOCM_DTR)
        mcr &amp;= ~MCR_RTS;
    if (clear &amp; TIOCM_LOOP)
        mcr &amp;= ~MCR_LOOPBACK;

    /* set the new MCR value in the device */
    tp-&gt;mcr = mcr;
    return 0;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The usbserial core also has been affected a bit by these tty core
changes. The tiocmget and
tiocmset functions have been added to the
struct usb_serial_device_type structure.
The tty calls to these functions are passed down to the lower
usbserial drivers, if the usbserial driver provides those
callbacks.

I would like to thank Al Viro, Christoph Hellwig and Russell
King for finally starting to work on cleaning up the tty layer
to raise it to the proper standards of the rest of the
kernel. Their changes have been instrumental in simplifying the
tty driver interface, allowing driver authors to focus on the
specific hardware implementations and not worry about the
kernel interactions as much as before.
