Linux is making big moves into
electronic design automation. Michael
introduces a way to implement your designs in
reconfigurable hardware.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x12781e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is a
user-programmable piece of silicon constructed in
very large-scale integration (VLSI) technology. The VLSI transistor-level detail
is absolutely predefined in an FPGA. Internally,
the FPGA consists of a matrix-like fabric
of logic and interconnect elements that are inherently flexible. Flexibility is
accomplished through programmable SRAM memory cells
that define the silicon resources. FPGAs are
standard commodity parts with trillions of possible
user configurations. This essential organizational
structure of the FPGA has persisted through two
decades of VLSI technology development. However,
today's FPGAs are utterly unlike those of
yesteryear.
</p><p>
FPGAs are blurring the lines between
hardware and software in systems. FPGA devices are inherently
soft-programmable and may be changed dynamically during the operation
of a system.
More compellingly, FPGA devices now also
contain embedded microprocessors within the logic fabric, and these
microprocessors can run Linux. Imagine a Linux computer
with up to millions of gates of flexible logic immediately around
it. One way to grok this new paradigm is to think of the following:
&ldquo;Software is configuration bits for hardware.&rdquo;
</p><p>
FPGA design is custom silicon design with less effort
than full-custom VLSI design. Besides processor cores, FPGAs today not only have logic gates
and flip-flops, they also have large Block RAMs, embedded hardware
multipliers, arithmetic acceleration logic, digital clock managers
(DCMs) for frequency synthesis, multistandard system I/O cells with
programmable line termination and multi-gigabit transceivers (MGTs).
These system-oriented resources,
along with the kinds of device packages and user I/O counts, are enumerated
in Figure 1, which shows the most advanced of the FPGA devices, the Xilinx
Virtex-II Pro family.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f1.large.jpg"><img src="6857f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Virtex-II Pro FPGA Family
</p></div></div><p>
The technology of VLSI memory is everything in this equation&mdash;FPGAs are in the realm of commodity
silicon manufacturing and typically have better
silicon wafer yields than custom VLSIs. Following Moore's Law, FPGAs,
much like DRAM and other advanced memory products, are the lead
silicon technology drivers, pushing the most advanced 300mm wafer
technology at deep submicron densities.

Tools for a New Paradigm</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, we introduce the most recent Xilinx FPGA design
tools. The design tools are called the Integrated Software
Environment, or ISE.
These design tools are now released for the
Linux platform as the Xilinx ISE 6.1i tools for Linux. This
allows
FPGA design on a platform having very low total cost of ownership.
</p><p>
Designing with an FPGA device is both different from and similar to
programming microprocessors in a language such as C.
Hardware
description languages (HDLs) are used to design logic at a high
level. Verilog and VHDL are the most popular HDLs in industry
practice, and ISE 6.1i supports both. These languages allow
description of hardware in structural or behavioral terms, or as a mix
of both. HDLs are the input source code for specialized compilers,
which either synthesize logic for a target or allow it to be
simulated. Here, our focus is on logic
synthesis, with an inside look at the FPGA and, finally, generation of
the configuration bitstream with the ISE 6.1i tools.
</p><p>
One way logic is different from software is that it's inherently
parallel. HDLs can describe numerous <span   class="emphasis"><em>concurrent</em></span> changes directly,
unlike the major programming languages, for example, when specifying
synchronous changes in a logic circuit based on the rising edge of a
clock signal. In logic design, as contrasted with programming, one is
often describing something that takes <span   class="emphasis"><em>area</em></span>, not
memory. Both
logic and programs require that time elapses during operation, and our
preference is normally that it be very little time. As we will see,
the ISE 6.1i design tools can help with both area and time
optimization.
</p><p>
This article covers the
basic steps in entering a simple but interesting design in Verilog
and explores some of the capabilities of the tool.
We also look inside the FPGA device configuration.
See Resources for more information about the Verilog HDL. Additionally,
refer to the July 2002 issue of <i  >LJ</i> (<a href="../099/6001.html" target="_self">/article/6001</a>) for an article on a free
Verilog tool, which
also contains a Verilog tutorial.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x12789d0"></a>
Setting Up a New Project with ISE 6.1i</h2></div></div><p>
For this tour, we synthesize a 16-bit pipelined parallel
multiplier by specifying it with behavioral Verilog. We use
synthesis to create and evaluate this result. Then, we use the
implementation tools in ISE 6.1i to create a configuration for a
particular Virtex-II Pro FPGA device. Various options of the toolchain are explained in the process, including a way to look
inside the implemented FPGA.
</p><p>
After the software is installed, we open a
shell and begin. The process starts by typing
<tt  >ise</tt> at the command line. This brings up the Project
Navigator, which is the screen shown in Figure 2. To
start a new FPGA design project, select a new project
under the File menu. This brings up the window shown in
Figure 3. Here, we enter a project name, MPY-TEST, and
indicate the kind of top-level module we're going to use for this
project. We are interested in an HDL top-level module for this tour,
but ISE 6.1i allows the use of several other top-level module
types.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f2.large.jpg"><img src="6857f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x1278ef8"></a>
Selecting an FPGA Device</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we've selected HDL, the next step is to let the tool know
with which kind of FPGA we're going to design. For illustration, we
use the most advanced FPGA devices, the Virtex-II Pro family.
This is shown in Figure 4, where the xc2vp7 device is selected, along
with an fg456 package. This device is one of the smaller Virtex-II Pro
parts, but it still has numerous resources.
Here,
we use only a small part of the device.
</p><p> The menu window in Figure 4 also allows
other choices. You can select the part speed
grade, and here we accept the default of -6. The
Project Navigator can be used to organize
your entire project flow. For instance, you can
perform both behavioral simulation and functional
simulation. The first type of simulation is a check
that you have a logically correct design&mdash;that the
design does what it's supposed to do. The second
type of simulation is post-FPGA implementation,
used for design verification of a completed chip.
The
device selection screen in Figure 4 also includes other options, such
as the particular simulator you want to use for HDL simulation and
what language to use for simulating an implemented FPGA. This might
include, respectively, some industry-standard tools provided by
Xilinx partners, or another simulator, and Verilog or VHDL.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f4.large.jpg"><img src="6857f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Setting FPGA Device Type
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x1279210"></a>
Entering a Design in Verilog</h2></div></div><p>
Next, we select a new source file for the design and give the
design a filename. In this process, we tell the tool what kind of CAD
document we're creating; in this case, it's a Verilog module.
We enter a
filename of mpy16.v,
with the .v being the standard filename suffix for
Verilog. It is customary, but not required to make the filename for
the top-level module the same as the module, or a name like
toplevel.v.
</p><p>
Several other kinds of
documents can be entered for the tool and added to the
project. We don't have time to examine all of these capabilities, which
include alternative entry modes (schematics) and the inclusion of
standard and custom HDL libraries made by the user.
</p><p>
To define this (first) Verilog source for the design, the Design
Manager offers some help. For the top-level module mpy16,
we fill out a module port table using a tabular entry
tool (Figure 5). Here, we define the wires that enter and exit
the top-level module, and these will end up as the external I/O pins
on the FPGA. The names of the ports entered are p,
x, y and clk.
</p><p>
We specify p as a
32-bit-wide output and the main inputs, x and y, as
16-bits wide. Because this multiplier will be pipelined, we also
include a port named clk, which will provide the synchronous
timing source for the multiplier. The port clk is only a
single wire, or net, so we leave out content for MSB or LSB in
the table. This means clk will be a scalar. In Verilog,
vectors are groups of wires or nets, and these are zero-base
indexed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f5.large.jpg"><img src="6857f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Setting Up the External I/O Pins
</p></div></div><p>
After completing tabular entry for the top-level module, we obtain a
summary dialog. Then
with the project set up, the Project Navigator brings up all the
tools and the initial outline for our Verilog module. This is shown in
Figure 6, with the skeleton source code in the upper-right corner. An
editor is supplied with
ISE 6.1i, and you also can
import HDL source code created with the Linux editor of your choice.

Listing 1 is the Verilog source code for a 16-bit pipelined
multiplier.
This code is done in a behavioral style,
and we're going to allow Xilinx Synthesis Technology (XST) to figure
how to implement what we mean by the
code. Today, synthesis is very powerful, and we simply can infer
the multiplier hardware, without having to specify its logic design
in detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x1279a50"></a>
FPGA Hardware Synthesis</h2></div></div><p>
With the Verilog entered, as shown in Listing 1, we start synthesis by
double-clicking on the Synthesize - XST button in the Project
Navigator tool scroll list. This design we've entered is easy to
synthesize and takes only a few moments. The synthesis results can be viewed by reading the synthesis report
file (Figure 7). The check marks in the tool scroll list at the
left indicate what Project Navigator accomplished. The synthesis
report file is in the upper right. You can look through this to see
how XST decided to infer your logic to the target FPGA, as well as
glean an estimated clock-rate performance for the resulting
design in that FPGA.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f7.large.jpg"><img src="6857f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Viewing the Synthesis Report File
</p></div></div><p>
RTL is a view of your logic
as various black boxes or logic gates that are situated between
flip-flop registers. RTL is the predominant view of logic in
synchronous design. The View RTL Schematic button in the ISE
6.1i tools offers an excellent way to get a graphical overview (Figure 8). You
can navigate across any hierarchy of modules in your design
with the RTL schematic being regenerated dynamically.
We're now ready to run the FPGA implementation tools.

FPGA Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
We start implementation by clicking Implement Design in the
tool list at the left in Project Navigator. For FPGA implementation,
the generic process automatically engaged by the tools goes as
follows: translate, map and place and route.
</p><p>
In most cases with FPGA design, you do not need to know the specifics
of the operation of these steps, with the exception of seeking
extremely high performance from the FPGA. But it can be helpful to
know what's going on. For example, map determines how the inferred
synthesis results get &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; to your selected target FPGA. Looking
at the map report file can provide useful information about the
allocation of resources. Similarly, sometimes it can be useful to read
the place and route (PAR) report file to learn whether
options are available to improve the speed of your design or to
constrain resource utilization more carefully earlier in the toolchain.
</p><p>
Other tools in ISE 6.1i not encountered in this article provide much
flexibility for performance engineering and for creating constraints
such as locking the FPGA I/O pins for subsequent use with PCB boards,
given iterative FPGA implementation to fix bugs.
</p><p>
This design used only one out of the 44 available multipliers on the
xc2vp7 FPGA. Also indicated are the 65 I/O pins that were requested
for this logic. The Pad report generated by the tool will tell you
which FPGA pins were selected in implementation. As mentioned above,
you also can preselect these pins for a board design, and this is done
with a constraint editor in the tool or by creating a constraint
file.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f9.large.jpg"><img src="6857f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. FPGA Worldview
</p></div></div><p>
FPGAs are fast CMOS devices. It's important for us to know how fast, in
order to verify static timing goals against system requirements. Other important
information for system design might include knowing setup time
information or clock-to-pin delays. ISE 6.1i provides an integrated
timing analyzer. A timing report file can be generated automatically,
based on all routing and propagation delays for the completed
implementation in the target FPGA.
</p><p>
You also can look inside the FPGA device by clicking
the FPGA editor tool after implementation. This tool opens a
separate screen (Figure 9). The initial view is a called a
worldview, where you can see your whole FPGA at once. As you probably can
see in the center view, very little of the 2vp7 was used.
This view becomes quite dense with high-utilization designs. The
large block in the view is the PowerPC microprocessor. Also visible
are other multiplier blocks, block RAMs and numerous other elements
in the FPGA. Various blocks in the design can be
highlighted selectively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x1672640"></a>
Bitgen and Device Programming</h2></div></div><p>
The last step in FPGA implementation is bitgen, or bit generation of
the configuration bitstream for the FPGA so that the device can be
programmed in a system. After pressing Generate Programming File, the bitstream is
created automatically from the FPGA implementation data. The
bitgen tool creates a report file, which is shown in Figure
10, in the upper right.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6857f10.large.jpg"><img src="6857f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Bitgen Results for FPGA Programming
</p></div></div><p>
After creating the FPGA bitstream, there are numerous options for
using it to create programming files. These depend a lot on the
hardware mechanism you want to use for programming the FPGA. The
options include PROM file, ACE file, JTAG file and direct configuration of
the FPGA.
</p><p>
PROM files are used for conventional PROM programmers, for example, to
make an EPROM that goes in your system. ACE files are used with the
Xilinx SystemACE CF programming solution. SystemACE CF is a low-cost
way to embed a CompactFlash device in your system. Using ACE files,
you can create data on a conventional CompactFlash card that can be
used for FPGA configuration, dynamic reconfiguration and
multiple-device configuration. You
also can boot the PowerPC processor this way.
</p><p>
JTAG files are used with Xilinx download cables over a JTAG chain for
the FPGA device(s) in your system. JTAG enables configuration,
control and bitstream or debugging feedback. In particular, JTAG is
the primary mechanism for the Xilinx ChipScope Pro 6.1i tool, which is
an integrated logic analyzer that gets embedded into your on-chip logic for live
in situ hardware debugging. You
also can configure the programming of the FPGA directly from a
PC, using the iMPACT tool and a download cable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1180580.0x1672a08"></a>
Linux and Interoperability</h2></div></div><p>
The tools also can be used on the command line, instead of with the GUI.
Once
the Xilinx binaries are on your Linux $PATH, you can drive
them with batch mode scripts, programs and makefiles. If you want
to run these
commands from the shell, you can crib from the command
log, produced by the Project Navigator, and improvise from
there. For example, these commands can be modified to add shell
variables. For the design created in this article, the generated command log text
looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We have introduced FPGAs in the context of modern semiconductor
technology, have described how software and hardware lines are blurring and
have taken a quick tour of the ISE 6.1i FPGA implementation tools on
Linux. You also can refer
