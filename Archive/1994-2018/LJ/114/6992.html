Nation without Software: Why Iraq Needs Linux</i></h3></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Ashraf T. Hasson</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #114, October 2003</div></div><div><p>
An ignorant, corrupt government, war and sanctions have
left Iraq without a software industry, providing a blank canvas for Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbcf580.0xcc7298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Iraq has been in the dark ages of software, both
in terms of using different available software and in developing its own.
While the rest of the world was moving toward a major evolution in
software usage and development, Iraq fell behind.
Because of the crises of wars and sanctions, the largest
institutions, both private and public, including the government,
didn't have the opportunity to research and implement the best
software for their needs. Instead, they took the first
proposal to come along;
unfortunately, Linux was not the proposal.
</p><p>
The software wheel turned too quickly to follow,
especially due to the absence of the types of facilities
needed to enable someone to become productive and
successful in developing software.
</p><p>
With the new situation in Iraq, copyright has returned,
and companies are willing to enforce infringed
rights for unauthorized software usage, or at
least prevent it from happening again, especially once
things settle down here. This will push sites in Iraq to look for
a substitute for proprietary software, because
cost plays a definite role here, although it is not the
main consideration.
</p><p>
Although it's nearly impossible to live without a
computer these days, the ignorance and corruption
of the past Iraqi ruling government held
back growth and even caused the degradation
of software usage in many vital departments.
Hence, while things are still fresh, Linux could
play a major role in aiding the rebuilding of a
real infrastructure in several different fields without
incurring heavy expenses.
</p><p>
This may require a Linux Community Center, which could
handle some difficult techniques, to be established
in Iraq to help with taking the first steps.
You can imagine the whole situation as a white
canvas to be sketched on and filled in with colors,
freely choosing which colors to use.
</p><p>
I'm sure there are unlimited ideas to
be implemented in many fields, which would have great benefits
for all in aiding different aspects of life. As we
are talking about infrastructure, the education
sector seems to be one of the most suitable spots
for Linux adoption, which might make it possible for
easy, fast and professional implementation of Linux
to do the job here in Iraq.
</p><p>
Establishing or rebuilding the knowledge network
itself may take some time, which in turn reveals
another angle in making Linux one of the main
stones in this construction&mdash;making it part of
daily professional computer usage. For instance, until
now many high schools have not changed their syllabi since the last
decade, and they do not even teach hardware or software basics.
</p><p>
Here it could be possible to teach Linux OS basics not in terms of
migration from one OS to another, or even in terms of a new OS, but rather
in terms of a powerful OS that will give fresh brains a chance to choose
before getting locked into something else.
This also applies to some colleges and institutions
on a more advanced level.
There is a lot of work to be done.
</p><p>At the new Linux Users Group of Iraq, our first priority
is to establish a Linux training lab and a lending library.
We are asking both Al-Nahrain University in Baghdad and
Baghdad University to host Linux training classes. We invite
key information technology professionals from important public
and private institutions in Iraq to participate in Linux training
classes and seminars. As our members' institutions develop their
Linux installation plans, we will collaborate on development of
localized documentation and shared resources, including mailing
lists and distribution mirrors.
</p><p>
Our Web site at <a href="http://linux-iraq.org" target="_self">linux-iraq.org</a> will be updated with information on
how you can help.
