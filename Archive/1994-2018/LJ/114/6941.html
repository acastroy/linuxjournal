How to use the Amd automounter to provide
uniform and easily controlled access to all your file servers from anywhere.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa2298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Administrators today manage large sites with
many Network File System (NFS) file servers and
clients. Users like to be able to log in to any
host and access the same files from any remote
server. The na&iuml;ve way of providing this access
to all users is to hand mount all file servers
on each client. Not only is this unwieldy to
manage, but any unreachable server can cause
all the clients to hang. Furthermore, users have
to know what name to use to access files from
certain servers.
</p><p>
The solution to these problems
is an automounter. An automounter is
configured with the knowledge of all file servers, such that administrators need only maintain the
automounter's configuration in one place. Moreover,
an automounter provides access to remote file
servers on demand when users first try to access a
pathname that leads to that server; this ensures
that only servers in use and reachable
are mounted on clients, minimizing the chances
for hangs. Finally, the automounter provides a
uniform namespace for the resources. For example,
the pathname /src/kernel can hide the fact
that the actual location of those files is
server1:/n/raid/l/ksrc/v2.4/21preX.
</p><p>
Most commercial vendors and Linux distributions include an automounter.
However, such automounters often work on only a single platform, use
incompatible configurations or provide a limited feature set. The
Amd Automounter, also known as the Berkeley Automounter, was developed
with portability and a rich feature set in mind. It runs identically on
numerous UNIX systems, provides a superset of features found in other
automounters and supports a large set of features for even the most
demanding administrator. If you are an administrator of a site with
heterogeneous UNIX systems and want to make your life easier, Amd is
the way to go.
</p><p>
This article explains how Amd works and provides a set of examples to
demonstrate Amd's capabilities. The article is aimed at site administrators
and anyone with a perversion for filesystems. We assume basic familiarity
with Linux, NFS and filesystems. It is impossible to cover the
Amd Automounter in detail in only a few pages; it would take a whole book to
do that. Nevertheless, our examples are designed to start with
the simpler, more common uses of Amd and gradually increase in complexity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa24a8"></a>
How Amd Works</h2></div></div><p>
Amd is a user-level d&aelig;mon that attaches itself to a directory, called an
automount point. Amd receives requests from the kernel whenever
users try to access that automount directory. Amd then ensures the
actual resource the user is requesting is available and responds to the
kernel's request. Finally, the kernel returns the appropriate status code
to the user, and the user magically sees the desired files in the
pathname requested.
</p><p>
Let's follow an example. Suppose Amd is started and attaches
itself to the directory /src. A user runs <tt  >ls -l
/src/kernel</tt>. The kernel knows that the Amd d&aelig;mon is the valid file server
for the /src directory, so the kernel suspends the user's
ls process and sends a message to Amd asking it to resolve the name kernel within the automount point /src. When Amd starts,
it loads automounter maps for each automount point. These
automounter maps can be read from plain files, NIS/NIS+, LDAP, N/DBM and
more. The map that Amd loads for /src is a list of key-value
pairs. The key represents the name that Amd should provide within the
automounted directory, and the value contains the information that Amd
requires to resolve access to the named key. For our example, the map might
contain:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kernel  type:=nfs;rhost:=server1;\
          rfs:=/n/raid/l/ksrc/v2.4/21preX
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, the key is <tt  >kernel</tt> and it is separated from its value
by whitespace. The value consists of three variable assignments, delimited
by a semicolon. We use a back slash as a multiline continuation
character. Variables are assigned values using the := Pascal-style
syntax. Here, the type variable says the map entry
describes an NFS mount. The rhost variable gives the name
of the remote NFS server. Finally, the rfs variable describes the
pathname of the exported directory on that remote host.
</p><p>
Going back to the suspended ls process, when Amd receives a
lookup request from the kernel for the name kernel, Amd consults
its map and finds the entry with that name. Amd mounts the
/n/raid/l/ksrc/v2.4/21preX directory from the remote host
server1. It then returns enough information
back to the kernel about the type and actual location of that NFS-mounted directory for the
kernel to resume the ls process. The ls process resumes
listing the contents of the directory /src/kernel, unaware of the
flurry of activity that transpired between Amd and the kernel, let alone
where the actual location of the files for /src/kernel is.
</p><p>
Amd also checks to see when was the last time an automounted entry was used
and automatically unmounts unused entries. This ensures that a system
mounts only entries actively in use. In case you're wondering if
you could control the timeout period, yes, you can. In fact, you can
control dozens of parameters. Now you're wondering
if you have to spend days configuring Amd. No, you don't; most parameters
have been tuned carefully with appropriate defaults.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa2818"></a>
Amd Startup Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
Amd uses a configuration file, often stored in /etc/amd.conf. The
syntax of this file is similar to the smb.conf configuration file.
Consider:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[global]
log_file = /var/log/amd
debug_options = all,noreaddir

[/net]
map_type = file
map_name = /etc/amd.net
mount_type = nfs

[/home]
map_type = nis
map_name = amd.users
mount_type = autofs
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa2978"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This amd.conf file first specifies global options that are
applicable to all automounted directories. All options are simple key=value
pairs. The first global option (log_file) specifies the pathname
to a file for Amd to log information such as errors and trace activity. The
second global option (debug_options) asks to turn on all verbose
debugging other than the debugging associated with directory-reading
operations. Next, we define two automounted directories. Here, Amd attaches
and manages the directory /net, the entries for which come from
the file /etc/amd.net. Amd also manages a /home
automounted directory whose entries are read from the site's NIS
(YP) server.
</p><p>
The mount_type parameter requires some background explanation. By
default, Amd appears to the kernel as a user-level NFSv2/UDP
server. That is, when the kernel has to inform Amd that a user has asked to
look up an entry (for example, /src/kernel), the kernel sends RPC messages
to Amd, encoding the NFS_LOOKUP request in the same manner that the kernel
would contact any other remote NFS server. The only differences here are
that
Amd is a user-level process not a kernel-based NFS server, and Amd
runs on the local host, so the kernel sends its NFS RPCs to 127.0.0.1. As a
user-level NFS server, Amd is portable and works the same on every
UNIX host. However, user-level NFS servers incur extra context switches and
data copies with the kernel, slowing performance.
Worse, if the Amd process were to die unexpectedly&mdash;which never happens, as our code
is 100% bug-free&mdash;it can hang every process on the host that accesses an
automounted directory, sometimes requiring a system reboot to clear.
</p><p>
A decade ago, Sun Microsystems realized these automounter deficiencies and
devised a special in-kernel automounter helper filesystem called
Autofs. Autofs provides most of the critical functionality that an
automounter needs in the kernel, where the work can be done more reliably and
quickly. Autofs often works in conjunction with a user-level automounter
whose job is reduced to map lookup and parsing. Amd is flexible enough, as
you can see from the above amd.conf example, to work
concurrently as both a user-level NFS server and an
Autofs-compliant automounter. All you have to do is set the
mount_type parameter to the right value. So why not use Autofs
all the time? Autofs unfortunately is not available on all operating
systems, and on those systems where it is available (Linux, Solaris and a
handful of others), it uses incompatible implementations that behave
differently. For those reasons, not all administrators like to use Autofs.
Nevertheless, with Amd you have the choice of which one to use.

User Home Directories</h2></div></div><p>
In almost every large site, user home directories are distributed over
multiple file servers. Users find it particularly annoying when their home
directories first exist in, say, /u/staff/serv1/ezk, and then&mdash;when
new file servers are installed or data is migrated&mdash;the
directories are moved to, say, /u/newraid3/ezk. A much better
approach is to provide a uniform naming convention for all home directories,
such that /home/ezk always points to the most current location of
the user's home directory. Administrators could migrate a user's home
directory to a new, larger file server and simply change the definition of
the ezk entry in the amd.users map. Here's an example of
a small amd.users map that mounts three users' home directories
from two different servers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#comment: amd.home map
/defaults  type:=nfs
ezk  rhost:=serv1;rfs:=/staffdisk/ezk
joe  rhost:=raid3;rfs:=/newdisk/joe
dan  rhost:=raid3;rfs:=/newdisk/dan
</pre>
</p><p>
This example starts with a special entry called /defaults that
defines values common to all entries in the map; here, all mounts in
this map are NFS mounts. The subsequent three lines specify the user's
name, plus the remote host and partition to mount to resolve the user's home
directory. Although the pathname for each user's home directory, such as
/home/joe, can remain fixed for a long time, the actual remote
host and remote filesystem for Joe's home directory can change often
without inconveniencing Joe.
</p><p>
As with Perl, there are several ways in Amd to achieve the same goal,
and some ways are better than others. The above map is not the most optimal map for
several reasons. So here are a couple of tips for optimizing Amd maps.
First, consider what happens when you access /home/dan and are
running on host raid3: Amd tries to perform an NFS
mount of raid3 (as an NFS client) from raid3 as an NFS
server. This is rather silly, going through the entire networking stack and
the overhead of the NFS protocol, simply to get to a pathname local to
the host. For that reason, Amd defines a different type of mount, a
link type (using a symlink). Dan's map entry thus can be rewritten as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dan  -rhost:=raid3;rfs:=/newdisk/dan \
      host!=${rhost};type:=nfs \
      host==${rhost};type:=link
</pre>
</p><p>
This revised map entry introduces several new features of Amd maps. First,
the back slashes are preceded by whitespace. Amd ignores whitespace
after the back slash but not before; Dan's map entry essentially is broken
into three distinct whitespace-delimited components called
locations. The first location starts with the hyphen character and
defines defaults for the map entry itself, overriding anything in
/defaults. The second and third locations start with
selectors. Amd map selectors are dynamic variables whose values
could be compared at runtime by Amd. As you might expect from the
mother of all automounters, Amd supports dozens of selectors. Amd evaluates
Dan's map entry one location at a time until it finds one for which the
selectors evaluate to true; Amd then mounts the given location. In order,
Amd first compares whether the current running host's name does not equal the
predefined value of rhost. On any host other than
raid3, then, Amd performs an NFS-type mount. On raid3 itself,
Amd uses a faster and simpler symlink-type mount.
</p><p>
The amd.home map contains a second inefficiency: it mounts /newdisk/joe and
/newdisk/dan from the same NFS server,
although they most likely are subdirectories of the same
physically exported filesystem. This is slow and wastes kernel resources.
A better way uses the same rfs but returns pathnames that are
subdirectories of actual mountpoints (sublink is
appended to returned pathnames automatically):

<pre     class="programlisting">
/defaults  type:=nfs;sublink:=${key}
joe  rhost:=raid3;rfs:=/newdisk
dan  rhost:=raid3;rfs:=/newdisk
</pre>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa2ef8"></a>
/net Maps</h2></div></div><p>
A common use for automounter maps is to allow the mounting of any filesystem from any host, often called a net map. This map entry
provides a comprehensive and uniform way of accessing all file servers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/defaults  fs:=/a/${rhost}/root/${rfs}
*       rhost:=${key};type:=host;rfs:=/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa3058"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This short example packs a lot of punch. First, we define the default
fs variable's value to be a pathname that uniquely identifies the
remote NFS server and filesystem being mounted. We can do this because the
fs variable defines the pathname on the local host where Amd
mounts remote hosts' filesystems. This pathname must be unique to avoid
conflicts.
</p><p>
Second, the actual map entry's key, an asterisk, is a wild-card entry that
matches anything and sets the key variable's value to the value of
the name being looked up inside /net. This wild-card key
value becomes the remote host's name (rhost). Next, we specify
a special Amd mount entry of the type host, and we set the
rfs variable to request mounting of all exported filesystems from
that remote host (starting with /). The host mount type in Amd works by
querying the remote host's rpc.mountd d&aelig;mon for the list of all exported
filesystems. It then mounts each of them in turn. For example, suppose
host foo exports two filesystems named /homes and
/proj/X11. If you <tt  >chdir</tt> to /net/foo, Amd mounts foo:/homes in
/a/foo/root/home and mounts foo:/proj/X11 in /a/foo/root/proj/X11. An <tt  >ls</tt> in
/net/foo conveniently shows these two mounted directories.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa3268"></a>
One Map to Rule Them All</h2></div></div><p>
In large sites with many subgroups (sometimes with partial
administrative control over the main group), there often are scenarios in which
what you can mount depends on where you are. For efficiency, you may be
limited on distributing binaries
for different architectures to different subnets. With a
single centralized set of Amd maps, it is possible to accommodate local needs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/defaults  type:=link
lbin  in_network(eng);fs:=/local/${arch}/bin \
      in_network(10.0.1.0/24);fs:=/x/beta/bin
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa33c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This map uses the in_network function selector. Function
selectors evaluate to true or false based on the current system conditions
and the parameters passed to these functions. This selector compares
whether the
current hostname is part of the eng network, often defined in
/etc/networks. If so, Amd expands the value of the arch
variable to the current running architecture. It also resolves the lbin
entry to /local/i386/bin on IA-32 systems, to
/local/sparc/bin on SPARC systems and so on. The next location in this
map shows that the in_network selector can match against
network/netmask pairs. In fact, not only can this selector match using
several forms, but it can match against any local interface up and
running on your host. This capability offers the benefit of optimizing network routes on
multihome hosts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa34d0"></a>
ISO-9660 Images</h2></div></div><p>
Many people keep ISO-9660 CD-ROM images handy, but accessing their content requires
burning them onto a CD-ROM or mounting the images on Linux using a special
loop driver. The cdfs mount type knows how to mount ISO-9660 CDs. But
if you list a filename in the dev parameter and specify the
loop mount option, Amd can mount those ISO image files directly.
You then can browse them without copying the files out of each ISO image:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/defaults  type:=cdfs;opts:=loop
shrike1  dev:=/iso/rh9/shrike-disc1.iso
shrike2  dev:=/iso/rh9/shrike-disc2.iso
shrike3  dev:=/iso/rh9/shrike-disc3.iso
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa3630"></a>
Do-It-Yourself Maps</h2></div></div><p>
Every self-respecting tool should have built-in extensibility mechanisms to
accommodate the unexpected. For Amd to mount a given filesystem, it has to
know how to mount it ahead of time (read: yours truly hacks the C sources).
Using the program type mounts, you can define a custom method for
mounting and unmounting any filesystem your native host knows about
but which Amd doesn't:

<pre     class="programlisting">
r2  type:=program;dev:=/dev/sda1;\
      mount:="/sbin/dohans dohans ${dev} ${fs}";\
      unmount:="/sbin/undohans undohans ${fs}"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa37e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The above example passes the predefined dev parameter, as well as
the automatically determined fs parameter to, say, a shell script
named dohans that can perform whatever is needed to mount
/dev/sda1 as a ReiserFS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19aa580.0x1aa38f0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Amd automounter is a powerful tool with many features to support
numerous sites' needs. With proper care, site administrators can provide
many useful features to users while reducing system administration efforts.
