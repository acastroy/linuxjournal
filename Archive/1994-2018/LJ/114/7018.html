At a recent demonstration of a network statistics
tool, the presenter pointed out a bar on a chart
and said that about half of the bandwidth used
at the site was for a peer-to-peer (P2P) system
called Kazaa.
</p><p>
P2P systems have enormous potential to free
independent artists and Web sites from big ISP
bills, sneak political information past censors
and, perhaps most importantly for our readers,
provide a challenging new platform to develop
software ideas. But, Kazaa is proprietary,
mostly unencrypted and, with a little work,
can be filtered out. On page 56, Chris Lowth
explains how.
</p><p>
Please do it. Read the article and filter your
company's Kazaa users into oblivion. It's one of
the projects you shouldn't have trouble convincing
management to approve, because legal threats for
hosting illegal copies of files on P2P systems are
big news. With the techniques covered in Chris'
article, you might be able to get a Linux firewall
approved for a company that doesn't use Linux yet.
There's always a first Linux project for every
company, and this makes a good one.
</p><p>
However, there's another, more important reason to
block Kazaa. The gap between what P2P needs to do
in order to be a useful free and anonymous speech
system and what Kazaa bothers to do, is shocking.
If you can detect Kazaa traffic, repressive regimes
certainly can. Help encourage the development of
strong P2P by blocking inadequate P2P.
</p><p>
Ready to start working on a P2P system of your own?
Brandon Wiley introduces a fundamental technique,
distributed hash tables, on page 71.
</p><p>
And, because the theme of this issue is system
administration, we cover two of the classic
problems: how to design a backup plan for quick
and painless restores and how to set up robust,
sane file servers. Now that blank CDs are
cheap, it makes sense to give each system its own
custom recovery CD. Craig Swanson and Matt Lung
cover Mondo for bare-metal restores on page 46.
Erez Zadok lays out the problems with NFS and
covers a flexible automount solution you can live
with, on page 52.
</p><p>
After the movie industry, the next big leap for the
Linux desktop is into electronic design automation
(EDA). Not only are open-source EDA projects
gaining features, the established EDA vendors are
porting their proprietary tools to Linux as well.
Michael Baxter explains how you can do hardware
design almost at the speed of software with Xilinx
chips and development tools on page 74.

Reuven Lerner's series on open-source content
management systems for the Web continues with
coverage of Bricolage on page 12. And, Eric Jeschke
is back by popular demand with more GIMP techniques
on page 80.
</p><p>
All you kernel hackers and scalability fans out
there can check out page 18 where Paul McKenney explains
the read-copy update (RCU) algorithm he developed
at IBM and how he and other kernel hackers are
making it work in the eagerly anticipated 2.6
kernel. Don't forget to download and test a 2.6
kernel with your own favorite apps and hardware.
With the freedom to hack comes the responsibility
to report bugs.
