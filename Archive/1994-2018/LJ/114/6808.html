Bootable Restoration CDs with Mondo</h1></div><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Craig Swanson</h3></div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Matt Lung</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #114, October 2003</div></div></div><div><p>

A quick way to restore from bare metal or clone
systems is to build a custom rescue CD image.
Here's how to automate the process and keep the
rescue CDs up to date.

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x10344a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>

The disaster recovery suite Mondo has become a
vital component of the backup and restore plan
for Midwest Tool &amp; Die (MTD). With the addition of
Mondo's backup tool, mondoarchive,
to our backup plan, we gained disaster
recovery from bare metal, quick rollback to known
good configurations and easy duplication of Linux
software loads. Mondo also has the ability
to support the cloning of LVM, RAID, ext2, ext3,
JFS, XFS, ReiserFS and VFAT filesystems.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x10345b0"></a>
Disaster Recovery</h2></div></div><p>
At MTD, we rely on tape to back up company and user data. We have used
several enterprise backup solutions, but disaster recovery has been an
issue with each one. In the past, to recover from bare metal required
re-installation of Linux from the distribution CDs. After the fresh
installation, the tape backup client software was loaded. Finally,
the system's specific software was restored from the tape backup.
</p><p>
Now, we create a bootable restoration CD that can recover
an entire system with its specific drivers and application software. A
tape restore then overwrites files that have changed since the
CD was created. Whenever significant system changes have been
made, a new rescue CD image is created to replace the existing copy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x1034710"></a>
Regular System Backup</h2></div></div><p>
Creating a rescue CD image is a straightforward process, so it can be
repeated whenever a snapshot of a system is needed. With today's large
hard disks, periodic backups are possible with mondoarchive. A cron job
automation example to handle this is explained later in this article.
</p><p>
Here, at MTD, we use mondoarchive instead of tape to back up certain
systems:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
For Linux machines that serve static data, tape backup is not
necessary. These machines can be backed up periodically with mondoarchive.
</p></li><li><p>
Sacrificial systems exposed to the outside Internet through a
demilitarized zone. These systems must be segregated from the internal
network and are not visible to the tape backup server. mondoarchive can
maintain a good copy of sacrificial systems. If a system's security
is compromised, restoration is quick.
</p></li><li><p>
Linux firewall routers having static configurations with no user
accounts and high security. For this reason, routers are not accessible
by our enterprise tape backup system. The router configurations change
infrequently, so mondoarchive is a good fit.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x1034ad8"></a>
Other Applications</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to backups, a rescue CD can serve as a bootable, restorable system
snapshot. mondoarchive's ease of use has spawned several applications
at our company.
</p><p>
Building a test bed is another easy task with mondoarchive. A system can be loaded from
bare metal and the known good load can be restored at will. When
the final system load is ready for production, a new CD image is
created. This becomes the disaster recovery and quick rollback CD for
the production server.
</p><p>
Mondo's restore utility is flexible. With the interactive
restore utility, we resize and restructure partitions. This is a
useful method for upgrading from an existing hard disk to a larger disk.
</p><p>
To duplicate an installed Linux system, create a rescue CD from the
entire system. Then, restore it to another bare metal box. If the
original system was configured to use DHCP for IP address assignment,
the new system will do the same. For systems with static IPs, both systems
now have the same hostname and IP address. So, make sure to load the clone while
disconnected from your production network. We use a test bed network for
this purpose.
</p><p>
As if these uses weren't enough, mondoarchive also includes an option to verify the archived files with your
system; therefore, you can use the CD as a benchmark against the present
system. This is useful for checking the integrity of static systems.
</p><p>
As you can see, mondoarchive is a flexible and useful archive and
cloning utility. If you value your data and/or server configuration, read on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x1034df0"></a>
Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>
The installation examples here pertain to Red Hat Linux 8.0, which is our
tested environment. Several dependencies need to be
satisfied before you can actually install mondoarchive. On Red Hat systems,
check for these required packages: afio, cdrecord, buffer, mkisofs,
syslinux and bzip2. If they all are installed, you can move on to installing the mondoarchive
packages. If not, you have a little bit of prep work to do. In most
cases you can find these packages on your Red Hat CDs. Alternatively,
you could download them from Red Hat, <a href="http://rpmfind.net" target="_self">rpmfind.net</a>, or
directly from the
Mondo home page. When you have located all the packages, install
them with <tt  >rpm</tt>.
</p><p>
After you have satisfied the dependencies, you can install the
packages themselves. Two packages specifically
need to be installed for mondoarchive. The mindi and mondo packages
can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo/index.html" target="_self">www.microwerks.net/~hugo/index.html</a>.
</p><p>
mindi is the portion of Mondo that creates boot and root
floppies/CDs. It basically makes sure that mondoarchive has everything it
needs to boot the archival CD or floppies. Install mindi first with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -Uvh mindi
</pre>
</p><p>
You also have to install the mondo package.
After mindi is installed, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -Uvh mondo
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x10351b8"></a>
Execution</h2></div></div><p>
Many different types of systems can be backed up in various ways with
mondoarchive. Here we describe only the situations we laid out
earlier&mdash;to
back up our servers and create clone systems.
</p><p>
In our environment, many servers perform various
tasks, and each of them is configured differently. Some
have multiple IDE or SCSI hard disks for massive storage, and some
have only one IDE or SCSI drive. There even are some RAID systems. On some servers the
data is ever-changing, and on some servers it hardly ever changes. It is
possible to use mondoarchive to clone all of these systems.
</p><p>
First of all, it may be a good idea to look at your disk usage
on a per-server basis. Pay close attention to what is being mounted,
where and when. There is no need to back up noncritical information if
it can be avoided; if you have large directories that do not contain
critical data, you should think about excluding them. For example, we
share data between servers over NFS and automount, and we have many of the
same shares mounted on each server. What you don't want to do is ignore
these mounted shares and have mondoarchive back up that data too.
After you have identified the unnecessary mounted partitions or
shares, you have the ability to exclude them with the -E option.
The format of that option should be as follows: <tt  >-E
/a /b /c</tt> where /a /b and /c are directories. This will ensure
exclusion of that data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x10353c8"></a>
Storing and Burning the ISO Image</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know exactly what you want to back up, let's examine the
mondoarchive command and a few of its options. You have the
ability to back up to CD, ISO images and an NFS share. In this article
we discuss only how to back up to ISO images for burning to
CD at a later time. For complete details on mondoarchive and its usage,
read its man page.
</p><p>
Before you run the mondoarchive command, choose a place on your drive
that has a lot of room to store a large ISO image file.
Say we pick
/home/mondo, and home is a 6GB partition. The command to
use looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mondoarchive -Oi -d /home/mondo -E "/home/mondo"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x1035580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The -Oi option tells mondoarchive to back up the
filesystem to an ISO image. Next, <tt  >-d /home/mondo</tt>
lets mondoarchive know the resulting ISO images should be put in the
/home/mondo directory. Depending on the size of your system, you may have multiple
ISO images created. Finally, <tt  >-E /home/mondo</tt>
excludes unnecessary directories. Here, we told it
to exclude /home/mondo, which could contain other massive ISO images and
cause your backup to grow unnecessarily.
</p><p>
In cases where disk space is low, you need to specify a scratch
directory. This is a temporary directory that mondoarchive uses to build its
ISO images before they are archived.
In this situation, it is wise to tell mondoarchive to put its scratch directory in a
large partition. Otherwise, mondoarchive most likely will fail when it runs
out of room. In the example below, pretend /var/local/data is a
large partition on your disk. To specify the scratch directory, run the
mondoarchive command adding an -S option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mondoarchive -Oi -d /home/mondo \
-S /var/local/data -E "/home/mondo"
</pre>
</p><p>
After running the command, mondoarchive checks your system, makes sure
everything is okay and begins its backup process. It continuously
shows its progress during the process (Figure 1) and may take a
while to complete. When it finally is finished, it asks if you
want to create boot disks. You can answer no, because the CD you
burn will be bootable. If you want or need the disks, say yes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6808f1.large.jpg"><img src="6808f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Mondoarchive Running
</p></div></div><p> When it's complete, you'll have ISO images
in /home/mondo or wherever you specified, from
which you can burn CDs. You can burn them in many
different ways, including using Xcdroast, Webmin
or the cdrecord command. To do this quickly, run
<tt  >cdrecord -scanbus</tt>. This
discovers your CD writer's bus, target and logical
unit number (LUN), which is usually 0,0,0:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cdrecord dev=0,0,0 speed=xx /home/mondo/1.iso
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x1035b00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When cdrecord is done, you have a restore disk for your server if it goes down.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x1035c08"></a>
Running as a Cron Job</h2></div></div><p>
mondoarchive also can be run automatically at a time of your
choosing by setting it up as a cron job. To set this up, first
create a script similar to the following and place it
in /etc/cron.daily/:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh
mkdir -p /home/mondo/`date +%A` &amp;&amp; \
mondoarchive -Oi -d /home/mondo/`date +%A` \
-E /home/mondo

</pre>
</p><p>
When placed in /etc/cron.daily/, this script runs every day at the
same time. Upon execution, it creates a folder in /home/mondo
corresponding to the day. If you run the cron job seven days
a week, there will be seven folders in /home/mondo, each named for a
day of the week and containing the ISO images for that day's backup. Of
course, if you want to have these on CD, you can use the cdrecord
command again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x102c650"></a>Restoration</h2></div></div><p>
You're probably saying, &ldquo;Great, I have a bunch of CDs; now
what?&rdquo; Because the CD you made is bootable, you can pop it right
in your CD-ROM drive and begin your mondoarchive restore learning experience.
Four different restore options are available:
barebones (nuke), interactive, expert and advanced.
</p><p>
If you're using mondoarchive solely as an emergency restore utility, the
only option you really need to worry about is nuke. After the
CD boots, type <tt  >nuke</tt> at the prompt and watch
mondoarchive do
its magic. After it is done restoring, your system comes back
to the way it was before you ran mondoarchive. This can be handy
in the event of a catastrophic server failure when you need to get back
up quickly. It also can be helpful when you're building preproduction or
test bed systems that you would like to roll back to a certain development
point.
</p><p>
The interactive mode of mondoarchive also can be useful. This mode
enables you to edit your partition table before restoring your system,
and it can come in handy when building clone machines with different
hard disks. Using mondoarchive in interactive mode enables you to change
the size of the partitions to which you want to restore data. This is
possible using a partition table editor provided in mondoarchive.
mondoarchive is even nice enough to resize your partitions when running in
nuke mode, but here you don't have control over the sizes it uses.
mondoarchive also resizes partitions in interactive mode, but you
have the ability to change what it suggests.
</p><p>
To use mondoarchive in interactive mode, boot to the CD and type
<tt  >interactive</tt>. A
menu appears asking you how you want to restore (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6808f2.large.jpg"><img src="6808f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Mondo's Interactive Mode
</p></div></div><p>
Your options are Automatically, Interactively and Compare. The option
we want to select here is Interactively. After making the selection,
you are asked where your data should come from (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6808f3.large.jpg"><img src="6808f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Selecting the Data Source in Interactive Mode
</p></div></div><p>
Select the appropriate location and continue. Next, a partition manager
screen appears (Figure 4) from which you have the ability to
edit partition information. You also can change the device name,
mountpoint, filesystem format and partition size. After making your
changes, click OK to continue.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6808f4.large.jpg"><img src="6808f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Editing Partition Information in Interactive Mode
</p></div></div><p>
From this point on, Mondo asks you a series of questions regarding
the restore operation:
</p><pre     class="screen">
- Are you sure you want to save your
  mountlist and continue?  YES
- Do you want to erase and partition
  your hard drives?  YES
- Do you want me to restore all your data?  YES
- Initialize the bootloader?  YES
- Did you change the mountlist?  YES
- You will now edit fstab and lilo.conf/grub.conf,
  to make sure they match your new mountlist.  OK
</pre><p>
Mondo then opens up /etc/fstab and lilo.conf/grub.conf for editing in
vi. You should make changes accordingly so they match your new mountlist:
</p><pre     class="screen">
- Edit them again?  NO
- Label your ext2 and ext3 partitions
  if necessary?  YES
</pre><p>
When Mondo is finished, it throws you back to a prompt for reboot.
Press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to reboot.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3c580.0x102d150"></a>
Verify a Software Load</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to a total restore option, mondoarchive also provides another function. In the event that the data on the machine you cloned
is static, you probably don't want that data to change. This is the case
at Midwest Tool &amp; Die with our Linux routers. Using mondoarchive, we have the ability
to verify a software load against the backup and discover
whether any changes have been made recently. This is easy.
First, reboot the system with CD #1 in the CD-ROM drive. Then type
<tt  ># compare</tt>.
</p><p>
When mondoarchive is finished, it puts the compare results in
/tmp/changed.txt. There will be differences between the CD and the live
filesystem you checked. Log files and most everything
in /var, for example, are going to change all the time, so don't worry
about them.
What you probably want to look for are changes to anything located
in directories such as /boot or /etc. The configuration files in those
directories are system-specific and should not change much after
the system is up and running. If you find changes to those files
and you don't remember making them, you most likely have a problem.
</p><p>
The only problem with doing the compare is the fact that you have to
bring down the system to verify it. Although this may not be a problem
in some environments, you may be in a situation where your servers
must be up 24 hours a day. In those cases, you probably are better off
doing the verification during a scheduled downtime. An alternative
to using mondoarchive to verify systems is the popular application Tripwire.
I would recommend using Tripwire for static systems that need
to be up all the time.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know the potential mondoarchive has for your
disaster recovery plans, we recommend exploring it in more detail.
In the event that something catastrophic occurs, you can recover
quickly and completely. Please visit the Mondo Rescue home page at
<a href="http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo/index.html" target="_self">www.microwerks.net/~hugo/index.html</a> and see what a great job Hugo
Rabson, the author and maintainer of mondoarchive, does in maintaining
mondoarchive. He is making our admin life a lot easier, and he could do
the same for you.
