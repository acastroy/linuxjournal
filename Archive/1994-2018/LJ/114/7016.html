Many people in the Open Source community have long believed that
open-source software and the government are a good match. As any
state-level politician can verify, US state governments are faced with the
worst budget conditions in at least 50 years. In addition to having to
gut and cut programs and services possibly needed by more people than
ever, many schools and state-funded universities are expected to provide
more technology for more students with the same or less money. In light
of these conditions, some proponents of open source believe now is a
perfect opportunity for states to save money by moving legacy systems to
and creating new systems that run on open-source software. It's no
longer a maybe, someday thing, if it's a small and adventuresome state
agency.
</p><p>
Getting governments to make these switches, however, is where logic
and progress can hit a wall of regulation, procedure and red tape. State
and local governments seem to be the best place to start the move for
change, so if we're going to give it a shot, we better know what the
current procedures are. To that end, Tom Adelstein has been writing a
weekly series for the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site that
covers the current state of open-source in government. &ldquo;Linux Access in
State and Local Government, Part I&rdquo;, <a href="../000/6927.html" target="_self">/article/6927</a>,
reviews specific states' endeavors to legislate consideration of
open-source software and details some of the detours these endeavors
encounter. In Parts II and III, <a href="../000/6952.html" target="_self">/article/6952</a> and
<a href="../000/6970.html" target="_self">/article/6970</a>, Tom covers particular state agencies
in Texas and Oregon and explains where they were successful in using
open source and where they were not. Finally, in Part IV, <a href="../000/6990.html" target="_self">/article/6990</a>, Tom walks us through the process of
getting IT legislation through state government.
</p><p>In a similar vein, Joe Barr's article, &ldquo;Austin, Texas to
Begin Linux Pilot Project&rdquo;, <a href="../000/6974.html" target="_self">/article/6974</a>, describes how the IT department for the city
of Austin is launching a city-wide program to use Linux desktops,
servers and thin clients. The city's new CIO is &ldquo;especially
interested in seeing what sort of performance and savings he can get
out of running office applications on a server with terminals as
the desktop&rdquo;. If cities and states can get out from under some of the
proprietary licensing fees and TCO, perhaps more money will be
available for all those national defense and antiterrorism programs that
states are supposed to enact without extra national funding.
</p><p>
Moving on to something a little lighter, here's your project for the month.
Use Jeffrey Taylor's &ldquo;Peering Over the Firewall&rdquo; how-to
(<a href="../000/6985.html" target="_self">/article/6985</a>), Snort, a custom cable and an
Ethernet hub to build your own low-cost intrusion detection system. By
the end of the project, the Linux box will be the firewall and router in
your home network, and you'll still be able to peer around the
router and see all incoming packets.
</p><p>If you have an open-source-in-government story or a
do-it-yourself project you'd like to share, send your proposal to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. Be sure to check the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site often; new articles are added daily.
