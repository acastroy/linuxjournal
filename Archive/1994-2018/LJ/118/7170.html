LinuxBIOS is more than a way to boot your
Linux box in a few seconds. The new in-demand software for
Linux cluster sites also offers a
fallback mode that can save your system if a power
failure strikes during a BIOS upgrade.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xef9298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
LinuxBIOS is a GPLed program that replaces the BIOS found on many
computers, including AMD64, x86, Alpha and PowerPC systems. LinuxBIOS is
a vendor-independent, architecture-neutral BIOS, more than 95% of which is
written in C.
LinuxBIOS is four years old. Some of the largest Linux clusters in
the world use LinuxBIOS, and some of the smallest embedded systems in the
world do too. LinuxBIOS has been used in robots searching for survivors
in the World Trade Center, as well as robots used in Afghanistan and
Iraq. LinuxBIOS is supported by many vendors, including AMD and Tyan. It
now is possible, for example, to order LinuxBIOS motherboards from Tyan.
</p><p>
In this article I describe the basic structure of LinuxBIOS,
the origins of LinuxBIOS and how it evolved to its current
state. I also cover the platforms it supports and the lessons we have
learned about trying to marry a GPL project to some of the
lowest-level, most heavily guarded secrets that vendors possess.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xef93f8"></a>
LinuxBIOS Structure</h2></div></div><p>
Before we can explain LinuxBIOS structure we need to provide a
quick overview of modern PC architectures. PCs consist of a set
of chips, including the CPU, graphics and keyboard controller,
all connected by buses. A bus is a set of one or more wires that
can be used to interconnect two or more chips. Some buses have
two wires, signal and ground, and other buses have tens or
hundreds of wires.
</p><p>
A highly simplified diagram of PC architecture is shown in Figure 1. The
different types of buses cannot be wired to one another directly,
so chips known as bridges are used to connect one bus to another. The
first bus is the front-side bus, and on most PCs it connects CPUs to
one another and to the north bridge. The north bridge connects CPUs to
both the memory bus and the PCI bus. In our diagram we show only one
north bridge, but there are many variations on this theme. The AMD
Opteron, for example, uses a north bridge for each CPU, and the
front-side bus connects only each Opteron CPU to its own north bridge. In
other words,
there is no shared front-side bus on the Opteron. Nevertheless, the north
bridge is an identifiable device in the Opteron chipset.
</p><p>
The south bridge, which almost always resides on PCI bus 0, is the next
bridge in line. The south bridge interfaces from the PCI bus to legacy
devices, namely the set of devices found on PCs ca. 1981. The south
bridge also drives the BIOS Flash part.

Bridges are chips that connect one bus to another.
</p></div></div><p>
When the PC is turned on or reset, the CPUs start fetching from a known
address, which traditionally has been from the top of memory (TOM)
minus 16 bytes. In the original 8086, this was address 0xffff0; on newer
PCs, it is address 0xfffffff0. This initial instruction fetch has to be
supported by the hardware somehow, even before it has been configured. A
lot of the hardware has to work for that first instruction fetch.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, when first turned on the PC hardly is ready to run C code and
barely is ready to run assembly code. The motherboard has to be brought to
life in stages. As a result, LinuxBIOS has a sequence of bootstraps, each
bootstrap being invoked when additional CPU resources are activated. Each
bootstrap assumes that certain resources have been enabled and that the
machine has a well-defined set of resources available.
</p><p>
These LinuxBIOS pieces are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The first 10 or 15 instructions that enable the CPU, enable a minimal
virtual memory capability (at minimum, 32-bit addresses) and enable other
resources needed to turn on memory (such as the I2C bus). They also
set the internal CPU state to clean up things, such as instruction pipelines.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory startup code, which requires a sane CPU and a working I2C bus
for interrogating memory parameters.
</p></li><li><p>
Code that loads object code originally written in C from
Flash to memory. The object code optionally can be compressed.
</p></li><li><p>
Code that can be run once memory is working. This code scans all
the hardware resources and initializes them.
</p></li><li><p>
One or more payloads that perform any custom final configuration
work and boot an OS.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We show all the phases in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7170f2.large.jpg"><img src="7170f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Phases of LinuxBIOS
</p></div></div><p>
LinuxBIOS supports an optional fallback BIOS in the event of BIOS
problems. The fallback support is built in to the BIOS when it is
compiled. Additional code checks flags in the CMOS
and determines whether the CMOS is corrupted, whether the previous BIOS failed
to start correctly or whether the user wishes to boot in to the fallback
CMOS. The fallback BIOS is a complete LinuxBIOS image, and its capabilities
are not limited in
any way.
</p><p>
The fallback capability is useful for unattended BIOS
updates. Consider the case of updating the BIOS on 1,024 or more nodes&mdash;what if it
fails halfway through? For most systems, you now have a very expensive,
very heavy paperweight. With LinuxBIOS, one simply resets the nodes
and they come back up automatically in fallback mode.

Origins and Evolution of LinuxBIOS</h2></div></div><p>
I started the LinuxBIOS Project at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) in September
1999. For the prior eight years, I had been building clusters of all kinds
and had built my first PC cluster in 1994. In all this time,
the BIOS had been a stumbling block in constructing larger clusters.
</p><p>
In 1997, I built the 144-node Cyclone cluster at the Sarnoff
Corporation. As an experiment, we had only 16 nodes with video. The
experiment was not successful; PCs using the standard BIOS simply are
too unreliable to have the video removed, because PC failure recovery
always requires interaction with the BIOS. It was clear that if we were to
move to ever-larger PC clusters, we needed to resolve the problems
of the BIOS.
</p><p>
We decided the ideal PC cluster node would have the following
capabilities: boots directly into an OS from some onboard, nonvolatile
RAM; configures all the network interfaces but configures no other
hardware; connects to a control node using any working network interface;
and takes action only at the direction of the control node.
</p><p>
Private industry was not the place to move on this kind of work, however,
so we never were able to take these ideas past the talking stage.
</p><p>
Once I got to LANL, I had the ability to pursue these ideas. Several
technology trends also made 1999 a far better year than 1997 to look at
this problem. In 1999, motherboards with 1MB of Flash were appearing, and
the self-describing PCI bus had replaced the older EISA and ISA
buses completely. Also important, Linux was becoming much better at doing more configuration,
as exemplified by the SGI Visual Workstation, which didn't even have a
standard BIOS.
</p><p>
It seemed clear that if we could put Linux in the BIOS part, we could
achieve our goals. Linux can do a far better job of running the hardware
than any BIOS we have seen. What we needed was a simple hardware bootstrap
that loaded Linux from Flash into memory; Linux would do the
rest. Hence, our early motto, &ldquo;Let Linux do it!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Before we got the LinuxBIOS Project going full steam, we needed to ensure
that Linux could be used as an OS bootstrap, which meant that Linux had
to be able to boot Linux. By December 1999, we had demonstrated Linux booting
Linux with the LOBOS work.
</p><p>
The easiest way to get work done in an Open Source world is to let
somebody else do it for you, so the next step in LinuxBIOS was to look for
somebody else's software. James Hendricks and Dale Webster found such
a system in the OpenBIOS Project. In the space of five days, starting
with the OpenBIOS source, they wrote and built a test system on our
Intel L440GX+ motherboards that could boot the system from reset&mdash;not power on, but reset. Starting from power on would take another five
months to figure out, but it wasn't bad work for five vacation days.
</p><p>
We realized early on that assembly code could not be the future of
LinuxBIOS. OpenBIOS was a lot of assembly code, with a difficult-to-master
build structure. Our small community began a search for a better
foundation for LinuxBIOS. Jeff Garzik found a new BIOS and learned that
STPC, which had written it, was willing to open source it. The STPC BIOS
became the code base for the new LinuxBIOS. The STPC code required
substantial reorganization so it could support multiple motherboards
and chipsets, but it did provide a good starting point.
</p><p>
The next six months were spent getting a few platforms to run
LinuxBIOS. Our first non-graphical platform was an Intel L440GX+
motherboard, followed by an SiS 630 motherboard. With the SiS, we got
our first corporate involvement. SiS supplied data books, schematics,
assembly code and technical support, all aimed at getting LinuxBIOS
running on its platform.
</p><p>
We learned what Linux could and could not do. At the time, we were working
with kernel version 2.2. We learned that Linux could not configure a PCI
bus from scratch&mdash;LinuxBIOS had to do that. We were able to take the PCI
code from Linux and, with modifications, use it directly in LinuxBIOS,
while adding the extensions we needed for true PCI configuration. We
learned that LinuxBIOS came up so fast, the IDE drives were not spun up.
We continue to support a patch for Linux to work around this problem. These
and a host of other lessons required some unexpected changes in our &ldquo;Let
Linux do it!&rdquo; philosophy.
</p><p>
By the nine-month mark, we had LinuxBIOS working well on two platforms,
written mostly in C, and we had the beginnings of corporate interest.
VIA and Acer contributed data books that allowed us to port to their
new chipsets. That summer James Hendricks began work on SMP support,
and in &ldquo;Let Linux do it!&rdquo; mode, that support was written as patches
to the Linux kernel, not as extensions to LinuxBIOS. At one point, with
our patches, a Linux kernel could come up as a uniprocessor and enable
the additional processors from scratch&mdash;something that heretofore only
the BIOSes knew how to do.
</p><p>
That summer, Linux NetworX joined the effort, and to our good fortune, Eric
Biederman got involved. Eric's most important early work was the Alpha
port. Eric also cleaned up the memory startup code significantly. Our
collaboration continues to this day; Linux NetworX is the largest reseller
of LinuxBIOS-based systems, and Eric has spearheaded the creation and
architecture of version 2 of LinuxBIOS.
</p><p>
That fall, we presented talks at Atlanta Linux Showcase 2000,
and while there met Steve James from Linux Labs. This partnership
allowed us, in the space of less than a month, to realize
our dream: we built a 13-node LinuxBIOS-based cluster for
Supercomputing 2000. The cluster booted to full operational
status in about 13 seconds.
</p><p>
By 2001, Linux NetworX had completed the Alpha port for the
DS10. We then built a cluster with 104 DS10s, all running
LinuxBIOS. The DS10 booted more slowly than the Pentium
systems, so it took this cluster 50 or so seconds to come to
full operational status, a speed that still was quite acceptable.
We were used to BIOSes that took 50 seconds simply to test memory.
</p><p>
The Alpha port demonstrated that LinuxBIOS was portable. Little if any
of the code changed, and yet LinuxBIOS worked fine as a 64-bit BIOS or
as a 32-bit BIOS.
</p><p>
Since 2001, we have added developers (there are now 11) and continued
to port to more platforms, the most recent being the AMD Opteron. We
envisioned LinuxBIOS as purely for clusters, but now non-cluster use far outstrips
LinuxBIOS use in clusters. We thought Linux could do everything hard;
LinuxBIOS does a lot now, including SMP startup. We would have preferred
to &ldquo;Let Linux do it&rdquo;, but the design of the AMD K7 SMP hardware requires
that SMP startup be done in the BIOS.
</p><p>
We thought vendors would jump in. It has taken four years, but in
this fifth year of LinuxBIOS development, we now are finding some
of the largest computer vendors in the world expressing interest. We
simply were a little optimistic on the time frame. Once vendors see the business
case, however, they get involved. Vendors sold at least $30 million US worth of
LinuxBIOS-based systems in 2003, up from $0 million in 2000.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xefa790"></a>
Platforms</h2></div></div><p>
LinuxBIOS runs on a wide range of platforms. Fifty supported
motherboards are in the source tree, but we have found that many motherboards
are so similar that a LinuxBIOS for one motherboard can work on
another. Companies build code for one motherboard, run it on another
motherboard and do not always get around to telling us.
</p><p>
LinuxBIOS works on 64-bit and 32-bit CPUs. CPUs supported include the
Alpha, K8, K7, PowerPC, P4, PIII, PII, Cyrix (VIA), Geode (now AMD)
and SC520 (AMD). Chipsets are too numerous to list. Form factors of
mainboards range from the smallest PC/104 systems to the largest K8
systems. An IBM PPC 970 port is in progress.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xefa8f0"></a>
Chipset Secrets</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most common phrases we heard from chip vendors in the first
few years was &ldquo;we'll never tell you that.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rdquo; being CPU information,
chipset information, motherboard information or any combination of the
three. The designs for these three systems
constitute highly guarded secrets. It seems amazing,
even now, that vendors are able to let us build a GPLed BIOS that
by its nature exposes some of these secrets.
</p><p>
How was it possible for us to get this type of information?
Simple, businesses are not charities. If there is no business case
for releasing this information to us, they do not do it. If,
however, there is a business case, then it happens&mdash;sometimes with
astonishing speed.
</p><p>
From what we can see, the two factors in our success were competition and
the creation of a market. Competition gave us a wide variety of choices
as to motherboard, chipset and CPU. Once there was a reasonable market,
vendors were concerned about being left out.
</p><p>
The experience at LANL is revealing. LANL's last two large cluster RFPs
have specified LinuxBIOS as a mandatory requirement. Spending on these
RFPs has come in at over $19 million US. Companies that had decided not
to become involved in LinuxBIOS could not respond to these RFPs. Companies
that had the foresight to get involved in LinuxBIOS early in the game
were equipped to respond. Foresight, in this case, conferred a
competitive advantage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe01580.0xefabb0"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
LinuxBIOS has come a long way in four years&mdash;as one person put it,
from &ldquo;I'm Possible&rdquo; to &ldquo;In Production&rdquo;. LinuxBIOS is used on everything
from the largest Linux clusters yet built to the
small&mdash;test instruments, MP3 players and portable clusters.
</p><p>
LinuxBIOS makes it possible to build systems without PC hardware
baggage. The systems can be optimized for Linux and thus can be more
compact and simpler. There is increasingly a business case for such
systems.
</p><p>
LinuxBIOS is now in its second version, with four years, at least
six CPUs and over 50 motherboards' worth of experience behind it. It
now takes only days in some cases to do a port to a new system;
originally, it took months. LinuxBIOS' impact on the world of computing
is only beginning.

Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>
So many people have contributed to LinuxBIOS that it is easy to
slight them by listing some and not all. Nevertheless, a few contributors
stand out as having made LinuxBIOS possible. First, of course, is Stefan
Reinauer and the OpenBIOS effort; Jeff Garzik, who got the STPC BIOS
Project set up on SourceForge as FreeBIOS; Ollie Lho, who did so
much to get our first workstation platforms going in 2000; Steve James
and Linux Labs, who worked with us and expedited the shipment in 2000 of
our first LinuxBIOS cluster; Greg Watson, who did the PowerPC port;
and Eric Biederman, who has done so much to get our really hard platforms
up and stable and who has done so much to create version 2.

for 15 years. He recently realized that one of his first clusters, a
16-node SPARC cluster, has a total power equivalent to one-fourth of one of the
2,048 processors in his newest cluster; his new cluster has 10,000 times the
