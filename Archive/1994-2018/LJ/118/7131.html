A new breed of IT firm is helping federal, state and local
governments create a &ldquo;public infostructure&rdquo; of interoperable,
effective Web-based applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f32580.0x202a240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux runs right under the radar, not exactly in stealth mode, at many
high-profile government agencies, including the Departments of Defense,
State and Labor; the General Services Administration; the Census Bureau;
and USAID. At the heart of these applications lies the LAMP framework,
which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP, Perl or Python. Tom
Walker, former Lt. Commander of Navy Special Operations and adamant
proponent of open-source technologies, said, &ldquo;The next computing
revolution, like that of the Internet, will emerge from unexpected and
perhaps even modest sources...the next great leap in computing and
software technology will come from small firms who have the creativity
and strength to stand up...by offering advanced solutions using Open
Source technologies.&rdquo; Firms like Walker's group and a few others
have led the charge on Capitol
Hill and elsewhere with open-source software (OSS).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f32580.0x202a3a0"></a>
Driving Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Lack of an integrated response within
the US intelligence community prior to the attacks of September 11,
2001 has heightened government awareness of the disconnected databases
in use throughout the country. As the Congressional Report on
Intelligence Actions and the September 11 attacks revealed, &ldquo;The intelligence
community continues to be fragmented.&rdquo; In response to this
situation, Peter Gallagher and Martin Hudson of devIS state, &ldquo;The
need for
governments to share information and solutions is fueling a new framework
for eGovernment problem solving.&rdquo;
Gallagher explains how Linux has made its way into the public sector:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Early on we were able to use OSS only because the applications
were outsourced. We could not talk about Linux, for instance. Now our
clients really are considering how OSS might improve their internal
environments&mdash;they want to talk to us about it. This is a big change.
It always is a pleasure to see the look on a customer's face when they
come to us asking about how to take advantage of OSS and then we remind
them that together we have been for years!
</p><p>
We have shown that it works rather than just talking about it. I expect
that in a few years there won't be interest in OSS for eGov per se,
it will be just another option&mdash;we think the winning option.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f32580.0x202a660"></a>
Open-Source Software Institute</h2></div></div><p>
John Weathersby sits in his office at the University of Southern
Mississippi pulling together geographically diverse groups of
people with a mission. He runs the Open-Source Software Institute (OSSI), a
nonprofit organization comprised of corporate, government and academic
representatives. OSSI exists to serve
as an advocate and as a collective
resource and venue for the promotion, development and implementation
of open-source software solutions between corporate, government and
academic entities. Additionally, OSSI serves as a forum for working
committees to
address open-source issues in regards to government/industry standards,
academic research, economic/market and legislative policy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7131f1.large.jpg"><img src="7131f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

(middle) pause with Mark Goodman (left) and Matthew Schick (right) from
the University of Southern Mississippi as they tour campus. The
Administration building stands in the background.
</p></div></div><p>
Shortly after inception of the Web site Government Forge
(<a href="http://governmentforge.org" target="_self">governmentforge.org</a>),
Weathersby reached out and began
supporting Project Leopard, a framework for developing LAMP applications
in government. Within two weeks, he pulled together open-source developers
to facilitate building a common infrastructure.
He next found an immediate application need
within the judiciary branch.
</p><p>
Other recent wins include a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement
(CRADA) with the Naval Oceanographic Office delivered in August 2003. The
Institute also serves as the coordination body
securing government certification for OpenSSL under FIPS 140-2 approved
cryptography. In addition, Weathersby has coordinated an effort in which the
North Mississippi Education Consortium (NMEC) will lead a pilot program
designed to provide free and open-source software to Mississippi's
public school system. The program, called Freedom to Learn, is part
of a PhD-level study exploring alternative technologies and methods
of reducing costs while increasing efficiency and student productivity
within public school systems.

devIS</h2></div></div><p>
Peter Gallagher and Martin Hudson direct traffic from the second floor
of the historic Underwood Building in Arlington, Virginia. Gallagher, a former
Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal, West Africa, saw the need for more
appropriate technology solutions in developing countries. Hudson had
a deep interest in making computers more useful and was pushing desktop
applications. They met as consultants, worked together at two different
firms and then decided to start their own company, Development
Info Structure (devIS).
</p><p>
Using LAMP became Gallager and Hudson's stock and trade. As Peter
explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The opportunity to develop a public info structure with less
redundancy, lower costs, greater flexibility and better service is the
eGovernment challenge in this new world. devIS anticipates further
expansion in the coming years based on accelerating interest in open
standards, eGovernment and efficient use of open-source software solutions.
devIS has capabilities in software development and outsourcing that
are unique for a small business, and projections indicate rising demand
and associated revenues. State and local governments are showing
increased interest in open systems. devIS has begun actively soliciting
partnerships with these groups. Recent changes to federal procurement
rules now allow state and local governments to purchase services from
federal GSA contracts, providing standard access to any governmental
agency at various levels.
</p><p>
OSS was essential to devIS as a small business competing against
mega-corporations for federal work. Some of the high-end proprietary
tools are so expensive to get started with&mdash;you pay for partner licensing
and all types of required training, including marketing...just to try
the product.
</p><p>
The next big thing, now that we all know we need to share data using
XML standards and Web services, will be to share components. I know
it will be hard, but it has to happen&mdash;eGovernment is accelerating and
the logic of public infostructure is too compelling&mdash;the necessary
standards and architectural boundaries are becoming understood.
Shared OSS components will move eGovernment ahead quickly.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Martin Hudson adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Government's adherence to published standards,
at multiple levels, is making the market more competitive, making it
possible for small companies like devIS to compete on larger, mission-critical, applications. When we formed devIS the higher order systems
looked more like fiefdoms for large integrators&mdash;small business could
not get in the door.
</p><p>
Our ability to implement inter-networking applications fully&mdash;we host
data servers for state, USAID, GSA and labor&mdash;makes us different from
most of the small businesses in our sector. And we are able to do that
largely because of our roots in open source.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Gallager and Hudson's recent wins include the US Department of Labor's
Workforce Connections program. They elaborate:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This just-in-time dynamic content publishing environment powers over 50
federal Web sites, including DisabilityInfo.gov, the official portal for
US government information on people with disabilities. The Workforce
Connections application environment also publishes structured learning
content, including question and answer interactions, all using the same
object-oriented engine.
</p><p>
The tool exceeds federal specifications for Section 508, which is
the federal implementation of the W3C Accessibility Guidelines. IT
contractors now are legally liable to meet these requirements just as a
construction projects must provide handicapped access. The system also
meets another standard important to the federal government called
SCORM, shareable content object reference model.
</p><p>
SCORM is an XML standard that makes it possible to share and re-use
learning objects independent of proprietary authoring/presentation
systems. Workforce Connections allows for distributed maintenance and
instantaneous publishing by government content experts through a secure
administration interface. The software was created in Python using the
Zope content application server and runs on GNU/Linux Debian with the Apache
Web server. Many of the sites are private. devIS currently is working with the
DoL to release the product under an open-source license.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
devIS also is doing work for the US Agency for International Development's
TraiNet Project. Gallagher and Hudson describe TraiNet as:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...a secure, Internet-enabled visa application
pre-processor [that allows] worldwide staff to comply with new security
rules for training foreign nationals in the US. A Web-based work-flow
interface, connected to a federated system architecture that relies on
XML messaging to compensate for inconsistencies in connectivity among
developing countries, provides a robust environment.
</p><p>
The system is in use at over 300 locations around the world to monitor
training programs worth hundreds of millions USD for thousands of
students. The visa processor has a secure machine-to-machine link
with Department of Homeland Security systems to facilitate centralized
production of the special student visas used for government-funded
programs. OSS technologies used include GNU/Linux Debian, Apache,
PostgreSQL and XML Blaster. Server-side applications are written
in Python. devIS built, hosts and manages this application, including
help desk and other operational support.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f32580.0x202b1b8"></a>
gOSapps LLC</h2></div></div><p>
As a career Naval Officer, Tom Walker gained extensive experience
in programming and Web enabling computer systems that support
international military and special forces operations. After leaving the
service, he
used his leadership abilities to build a client list for gOSapps LLC of
more than 400
customers. To date, his organization has installed more than 500 LAMP applications.
</p><p>
Walker's enthusiasm for open-source software is evident. He
recently spoke at a Department of Defense staff briefing on the security,
reliability and performance of open-source software. He told his audience:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The DOD decision [to use open-source software] will result in widespread
changes in software development and acquisition throughout the federal
government and with government contractors. The challenge for many
departments is that right now the new policy has raised more questions
than answers in a fast growing segment of the technology industry.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
One of gOSapps LLC's projects is the Open Source Initiate Review (OSIR).
OSIR provides formal
expert analysis of existing system architectures and applications to help
government agencies reach a high level of preparedness for open-source transition.
</p><p>
Recent wins for Walker include the US Navy's
Technical Support Group Summary. Walker writes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We
provided the architecture, design and deployment of secure Web and CD-based
training programs. The Technical Support Group (TSG) required a reliable
method to deliver training on secure advanced communications system
to remote locations. This training required delivery by a variety of
transfer methods.
</p><p>
Additionally, due to ever-changing technological changes, the data
had to be updated easily, minimizing the costs for program changes. We
deployed special strategies and created a multimedia training system
that was both informative and entertaining. The data is transferable
on CD or over secure communication links.
</p><p>
Additionally, by allowing last minute compilation of data from a secure
database, the training is always up to date. This data compilation is
performed automatically, minimizing the training costs and time requirements
for the technical support staff. An internal object-oriented framework
utilized results in lower development time and costs, far fewer pre-QA
defects and a richer feature set. The MySQL relational database allowed
us to use complex data-driven applications, coupled with reliability
and speed. We had a direct role in all aspects of the development cycle,
coupled with close communication and feedback from the client, resulting
in an advanced yet intuitive interface to meet client needs.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Walker's team also developed an on-line LAMP application to manage the database
of storm water facilities and their ratings for James County, Virginia.
Walker explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We developed the front-end interface for searching and viewing facility
information. We also developed complete functional design specifications,
carried through to development and deployment of multi-tiered relational
database-driven Web applications.
</p><p>
The system is designed to meet the county's specific need to post
and broadcast notifications of watershed quality results. The entire
application is maintained through an intranet system, all managed by a
unified administrative application.

National Center for State Courts</h2></div></div><p>
James E. McMillan, employed at the National Center for State Courts has
fashioned a Web site that says, &ldquo;If you have ever wanted to try out
court E-filing, now you can. Just click on the E-File a Document link above
or the button below and fill in the forms.&rdquo;
The Web site also states, &ldquo;You will be sent a password (you must have
a working e-mail address) and attach your document. Or, you can fill
out our demonstration complaint form.&rdquo;
James directs the Court
Technology Laborartory (CTL, <a href="http://ctl.ncsc.dni.us/about_jim_mcmillan.htm" target="_self">ctl.ncsc.dni.us/about_jim_mcmillan.htm</a>).
</p><p>
McMillan has made his LAMP Project available to all the courts in the
world. The inCounter Web site provides the downloadable source code to the
inCounter Electronic Filing Manager Project. Look for a link that says
&ldquo;inCounter Open Source E-filing System&rdquo; on James' Web page
mentioned above. The link will take you to the current location of his OSS
project.
</p><p>
Why are we doing this? To help the courts and legal system adopt
electronic communication.
Specifically, the inCounter Electronic Filing Manager Project is an
effort to build the core functionality of an electronic filing inbox
that has the following initial goals:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Demonstrate electronic court document filing.
</p></li><li><p>
Demonstrate a simple-to-use system (limited initial scope).
</p></li><li><p>
Create an expandable and customizable system through use of open-source code.
</p></li><li><p>
Demonstrate support for CourtXML/OASIS LegalXML filing standards.
</p></li><li><p>
Demonstrate support of the W3C SOAP XML communications standard (to
connect commercial and advanced systems).
</p></li><li><p>
Demonstrate the use of free Linux, Apache, Perl and MySQL software
in a court application.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
McMillan joined the National Center for State Courts in October 1990.
Since then, more than 1,000 visits from courts
in 50 states and more than 70 foreign nations have been held in the CTL.
Over 10,000 people have viewed remote CTL presentations. In November
2000, the TIES-CTL Project received the State Justice Institute's Howell
Heflin Outstanding Project award.
</p><p>
With credentials comes credibility and McMillan has plenty. He previously held positions
with the US Department of Justice and the Los Angeles Superior Court.
He was a keynote speaker at the Fifth National Court Technology
Conference and a lecturer at the National Judicial College, University
of Southern California Judicial Administration Program, Smithsonian
Associates, and many other national and international court, law and
technology interest groups.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Few of us have ever heard of the open-source organizations mentioned
above. They have success because they deliver government solutions. In
so many ways, they have paved the way for the rest of us. I hope you
enjoyed finding out about them as much as I did in locating them.
