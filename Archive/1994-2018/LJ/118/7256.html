No matter how long it took, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; version on a proprietary
platform somehow never seemed to have the stability,
performance or maintainability of the version you put
together with Perl, Python or PHP. The good news is that now,
even for the most conservative employers or clients, you no
longer have to redo your Linux projects on an approved platform.
</p><p>
The tools you have been using to build Web sites that aren't
business-critical now are seeing action in core business apps
at more and more companies.
</p><p>
There's always someone who says that you can't possibly develop
business apps on <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>&mdash;it doesn't have feature
X. Soon, though, someone does write feature X for the new platform, or it turns
out that you don't need feature X to do business apps anyway.
Then new projects that could have gone with the legacy
platform start going to the new one.
</p><p>
That's what's happening right now with the all-free, all-open
source LAMP platform, consisting of Linux, Apache, MySQL
and the &ldquo;P&rdquo; languages&mdash;Perl, Python and PHP.
</p><p>
Giovanni Organtini and Luciano M. Barone cover one large
success story on page 36. Their LAMP-based work-flow management
system, used in assembling a particle physics instrument with
500,000 parts, has replaced a proprietary system. The new system cuts CPU
and memory loads, improves performance and, most important,
slashes the amount of time that operators spend interacting
with the system, giving them more time to work on the product.
</p><p>
On page 50, Tom Adelstein has some encouraging news: the LAMP
platform also is the basis of US government IT projects at
the Navy, the Department of Labor and other agencies. He reports
that state and local governments are succeeding with Linux too.
Selling to the government is hard, but the consulting firm
gOSapps LLC has done more than 500 apps for 400 government bodies.
Fewer of your tax dollars are being wasted on lock-in, but there's
still work to be done.
</p><p>
Doc Searls has been following IT's biggest behind-the-scenes
story for a year now. Customers are using the power of Linux
and other open-source software to take control of their own
technology decisions. Acronym alphabet soup and projected
releases in 2005 or 2006 might make for entertaining reading,
but when you've got a project to do, it's time to break out the
tools that give you freedom. Doc reports on Linux successes
at Morgan Stanley, Ticketmaster and Ernie Ball, on page 48.
</p><p>
Customer-facing Web sites have long taken advantage of
Linux's performance, flexibility and low total cost of
ownership. The record industry, however, hasn't been on
the best of terms with the Web. Time to start over.
On page 42, John Buckman explains how he is running a
record company that treats both the audience and the artists
with respect, not with Digital Rights Management or other such
indignities. I'm listening to an album I bought from the site
right now.
</p><p>
Whatever your business or your pleasure, there's something
for you in this issue. It's not all about the Web, either. With the
article by Brett Schwarz on page 72, you can
build a custom phone system that saves money, integrates
voice over IP and even gives you a pop-up warning of special
callers. Have a productive and successful month, and see you next time.
