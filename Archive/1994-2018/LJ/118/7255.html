USB Joystick?</h4><p>
I have a Logitech Wingman Force 3D, a USB joystick with
force feedback. I'm running a 2.4.20-20.9 kernel (Red Hat 9) with USB support
enabled. Is there a way to make USB joysticks work under Linux?
I've done searches on Google and I found a few possible solutions, but
none of them worked for me. I do not care so much for the force feedback
component, but I would like to be able to make the joystick work.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Pierre Rochefort  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:prochefort@rogers.com">prochefort@rogers.com</a>
</p><p>
USB joysticks should work fine under Linux.
To learn how to configure them, see the Linux USB Guide at <a href="http://www.linux-usb.org" target="_self">www.linux-usb.org</a>. If you still have questions
about USB support, you can ask on the linux-usb-users mailing
list.

According to Johann Deneux's Web page at <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~johannd/projects/ff/index.shtml" target="_self">user.it.uu.se/~johannd/projects/ff/index.shtml</a>, he is developing a
force-feedback driver for Linux.
Complete instructions and
downloadable code are provided on this page, so you can test whether this driver
works with your device. You might find
you need some code compiling and module installation skills, but it
may be worth the learning experience.
You also might want to try the Linux Input Driver (<a href="http://linuxconsole.sourceforge.net/input/hardware.html" target="_self">linuxconsole.sourceforge.net/input/hardware.html</a>) or the Linux
joystick driver (<a href="http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick" target="_self">atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~vojtech/joystick</a>), which also states that it supports your device.

Configuring a New Network Card</h4><p>
I need to configure my third network card on my Red Hat 6 system
to start automatically when the system reboots. How can this be done?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Akaize   <br><br><br><a href="mailto:akaize@zmsn.com">akaize@zmsn.com</a>
</p><p>
Your Red Hat release is a bit old; I'd suggest you upgrade it because
you will get many benefits, such as security, stability and more hardware
drivers. Nevertheless, you can try the user-friendly approach by using
the netcfg or netconfig utility (from a root shell) and following
on-screen instructions and options. Alternatively, you can edit the
/etc/modules.conf and the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX (where X
is the net card number) files manually. The modules.conf file names each card
and relates that name to the corresponding module (driver) that you
need to have in your system. The ifcfg-ethX file is the actual
configuration file of the card; there is one of these files per network
card. Follow the example of the first file, which must be named
ifcfg-eth0. The Ethernet HOWTO contains more information: <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-2.html#ss2.4" target="_self">www.ibiblio.org/mdw/HOWTO/Ethernet-HOWTO-2.html#ss2.4</a>.

Setting Up Wi-Fi Restricted Mode on SuSE</h4><p>
I successfully installed SuSE 9.0 on my laptop, a
ThinkPad 600E that uses a Netgear MA401 wireless card. SuSE has
detected my card properly, and I have 128-bit encryption enabled and
working. The problem is I need to put the card in restricted mode
manually to be able to communicate with the access point. Every time I
reboot the laptop, I have to <tt  >su</tt> into root and type
<tt  >iwconfig wlan0 key xxxxxxxx
restricted</tt> to make the card work. I configured the card properly using
YaST and included the encryption key, but it always defaults to open
mode. Did I miss something here? How can I make iwconfig default to
restricted mode?

Kevin Lisciotti  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:lisciotti@yahoo.com">lisciotti@yahoo.com</a>
</p><p>
Make a copy of the file /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg.template and
edit it to set the
parameters according to your proper setup. Also, take a look at
<a href="http://portal.suse.com/sdb/en/2002/11/wavelan.html" target="_self">portal.suse.com/sdb/en/2002/11/wavelan.html</a>, which

Red Hat 7.2 and Ethernet Card</h4><p>
I recently installed the Red Hat 7.2 distribution (my first Linux
installation) that came with the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Administration for
Beginners</em></span>,
which I borrowed from a friend. When I installed Red Hat 7.2, I did not get
a network config screen, as was suggested and shown in the book. The
installation is supposed to recognize my network or something, but it
doesn't. Hence I have been unable to set up my Internet connection, which
is key
to more resources for learning other than man pages.
</p><p>
I am using a home PC with the following components: Intel 3 500MHz,
256MB of RAM, 20GB WD Caviar IDE and Realtek (also tried it with D-Link card)
NIC. I am connected by a cable modem and have no network, although I plan
on expanding to two computers soon.
</p><p>
Red Hat 7.2 does not seem to recognize eth0, although there is a constant
connection. I have searched and searched for instructions. Most direct me
to install drivers from floppies for Realtek, which already appear to come
with the distro, but as I said, I am really new to this and have no clue.
I am about to go buy Mandrake or Red Hat 9 to see if either proves to be a
more useful installation.

Without knowing specific error messages or seeing some log
files, it is extremely difficult to guess what is going
on with your system. Is your network card okay? Is it
properly installed? Does it have any conflicts with other
hardware? Instead of buying another Linux
distribution, you probably should buy a new network card,
one that you know is officially supported. Go to <a href="http://hardware.redhat.com/hcl" target="_self">hardware.redhat.com/hcl</a> and look for a network card
that fits your budget and your system.

</p><p>
To rule out a hardware problem, try your system with Knoppix
(<a href="http://www.knoppix.net" target="_self">www.knoppix.net</a>), which lets you run a current Linux
from CD without installing on your hard drive. You can
download and burn Knoppix freely. If the card works under Knoppix,
you'll have more fun and have more time to learn administration
skills if you upgrade to a more current distribution. For your
first Linux distribution, try to select one with which your local user
group, or whatever source of support you use, is familiar.

Reconfiguring Wireless Keys for Different Sites</h4><p>
I use Wi-Fi on my laptop (running Red Hat 6.2) at a number of
different sites, each one with a different set of encryption keys. It's
a hassle to have to edit /etc/pcmcia/config.opts every time. Is there an
easier way to manage my keys?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Andreas Meyer  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:ysgdhio@yahoo.com">ysgdhio@yahoo.com</a>
</p><p>
Jean Tourrilhes maintains an extensive list of wireless
utilities that do things like manage configurations and
monitor signal strength at <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html" target="_self">www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html</a>.
One of the tools listed is waproamd, which automatically
sets up preconfigured WEP keys based on the ESSID of the wireless
network you're on (<a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/waproamd" target="_self">0pointer.de/lennart/projects/waproamd</a>).
There are also two simpler ways to deal with this issue, as explained
in Felipe's answer and my other answer.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Don Marti  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>
</p><p>
For a poor guy's quick-and-easy way with not much hassle: 1) write a small
shell script in /usr/local/bin for each site. Name each
wireless-sitename or something similar, list the corresponding appropriate iwconfig
and ifconfig commands (including the keys, of course) and set the proper
permissions and ownership. Whenever you get to the site, simply run the
wireless-sitename script and you should be set. This allows individual
turn on/off control of access in each of your preferred network sites.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Felipe Barousse Bou&eacute;  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:fbarousse@piensa.com">fbarousse@piensa.com</a>
</p><p>
The way I deal with this kind of thing is to make extra
copies of the config file. For example, you can create
config.opts.home and config.opts.cafe, then set up an alias
or panel button for cafe to do this:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

sudo cp /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.cafe \
/etc/pcmcia/config.opts \
&amp;&amp; sudo /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia restart

</pre><p>
and an alias or panel button for home to do the same thing
with the home version of the file.

Managing Desktop Users and Policies?</h4><p>
I have worked at several businesses that could use the power
of Linux on the desktop, but so far I have been reluctant to
suggest it. It's not that I don't think it's a superior product
or that the relative cost savings are significant. It has to
do with the fact that these organizations are not likely to
want to replace conventional computers with dumb terminals
or low-powered network computers tied to a mainframe or
server. Tied into this is the issue of administering 20
machines, 100 machines or 2,000 machines.
I have not found anything so far that lets me sit down and
look at a domain tree of users and administer polices and
profiles. My ignorance may be blatantly clear at this point. I
am a Linux user at home, but I am a Windows administrator and
like the apparent ease of managing a Windows network.
Can you point me in the right direction
on this? Maybe I don't understand the vision or current mindset
of the community on system administration.

Undoubtedly and disregarding the used technologies, you are talking about
a complex network configuration. Many issues come up: user
management, password management, directories, e-mail addresses, IP numbers,
shared resources and security. Many system administration tools
and efforts exist in the Free Software/Open Source community to deal with
these issues. One of them that I have used several times is Webmin,
<a href="http://www.webmin.com" target="_self">www.webmin.com</a>. Webmin is a powerful and extensible systems
management tool; it even allows clustering and remote systems management.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Felipe Barousse Bou&eacute;  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:fbarousse@piensa.com">fbarousse@piensa.com</a>
</p><p>
A flexible way to manage user information is with LDAP.
Craig Swanson and Matt Lung covered a unified system for shared
address books, unified login and shared file storage in the
December 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (<a href="../104/6266.html" target="_self">/article/6266</a>).
If you like the Webmin interface, you can use Webmin to manage
an LDAP database.
