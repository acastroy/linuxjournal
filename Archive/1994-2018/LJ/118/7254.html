software and is 16MB in size. Included in the NIOS Platform
is NetIntelligence, an artificial intelligence module that
uses autonomic features to deploy, install and maintain system
components and internal subsystems, including firewall and DHCP
parameters and DNS records. The SystemER program enables system
recovery from catastrophic failure in under two minutes. Other
components include ExchangeIt!, a collaboration server;
TunnelVision, an intelligent VPN solution that works without
