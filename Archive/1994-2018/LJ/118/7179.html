A MySQL-based system handles the data management,
quality control and bookkeeping for building a new scientific
instrument with 500,000 parts. Here's how you can adapt it
for your manufacturing process.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeba580.0xfb25b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Subnuclear particles, tiny objects indeed, need to
be revealed and measured by huge detectors. This field is known as high-energy Physics
(HEP), and experimental HEP is a cutting-edge science. It uses and promotes
the most recent technologies, it invents new tools
and it encourages knowledge exchange. For all of these reasons,
HEP has long been the realm of open-source software.
</p><p>
The bad news is HEP has become increasingly complicated;
what was built in a craftsman-like style yesterday is now
an industrial process that requires dedicated management
software, usually expensive. We are living this experience in
our experiment: a large international collaboration engaged
in the construction of a 12,500-ton detector, called CMS
(Compact Muon Solenoid), scheduled to take data at the CERN,
Geneva, Large Hadron Collider in 2007. Our
group in Rome, endowed by the Italian Institute for Nuclear
Physics (INFN) and located in the Physics Department of the
University La Sapienza, is working on the construction
of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The calorimeter is made from about 500,000
parts, including scintillating crystals and photo-detectors.
This process requires data management, quality control
and bookkeeping, all of which relies on work-flow management.

Work-Flow Management</h2></div></div><p>
A work-flow management system (WFMS) is &ldquo;software that enables the
automation of a business process, in whole or part, during which
documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to another
for action, according to a set of procedural rules&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.e-workflow.org" target="_self">www.e-workflow.org</a>).
Using a WFMS allows a coordinator to establish the flow of operations needed to
realize a product. Operators are guided through the construction sequence,
and unforeseen deviations from the sequence are avoided. Each operation
generates data, such as measurements, comments and tags, that are recorded in a
database.
</p><p>
Originally, a WFMS based on proprietary components
was used in our production for about two years. It proved
to be clumsy, slow, resource-demanding, hard to resume after hang-ups and
troublesome to integrate with other tools. When the flow of incoming
calorimeter parts became higher and the assembly rate could not catch up, we made the decision
to develop our own solution, based on open-source components.
Our requirements were to avoid the previous inefficiencies, to interface
transparently with input and output data and to have a flexible
solution. We chose to implement a system based on the LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl/PHP/Python) platform. Each component of LAMP has an
important role: Linux and Apache provide the basic infrastructure for
services and programming; MySQL is the back end of our WFMS; and Perl/PHP
manage the interaction operator database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeba580.0xfb2ad8"></a>
REDACLE: the Database Design</h2></div></div><p>
Our WFMS is called REDACLE (Relational ECAL Database at Construction
LEvel). In more detail, our requirements for the database design were:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
High flexibility: the database structure should not change when adding
new products or activities.
</p></li><li><p>
Ability to store quality control (QC) data: quality assurance is an
important part of our work and collected data must be available to
everyone for statistical analysis.
</p></li><li><p>
Variety of access: the database should be able to be queried through different methods,
including
shells, programs, scripts and the Web.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Requirement 3 automatically was satisfied by MySQL, and this fact,
 together with its simplicity and completeness,
was the main
reason we adopted LAMP. In
order to satisfy the first two requirements, we developed a set of tables
following a pattern, which is a common and standard way to solve a given
problem, as in OO programming. We used the pattern called homomorphism,
which is a simple representation of a many-to-one
relationship. In practice, each part of the specific process with which we
are dealing is represented in the database as records in two tables,
an object table and an object definition table.
Each object definition has an ID, actually a MySQL primary key number.
Many objects share the same object definition, and the relationship
between them is provided by a foreign key in the object table containing
the corresponding definition ID.
</p><p>
An example might explain this design better. As stated in the introduction, our
calorimeter is composed of many parts of different types. Each kind
of part, such as a crystal, has many instances. The whole calorimeter has
about 75,000 crystals. Parts and part definitions are kept
in two separate database tables, as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Different instances
of a part share the same part definition by the proper part ID in the
partDefinition_id column. In these two tables,
the part 33105000006306 is a type 1L barrel crystal, as shown by its
partDefinition_id 195 found in the partDefinition table.

</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xeba580.0xfb2f50"></a><p class="title"><b>

The real benefit of this approach is flexibility. If, for any reason,
new parts enter the game, the REDACLE database structure will
not be modified. It is enough to add a new record to the definition
table and relate it to new parts. But the REDACLE database is even
more flexible; if we were building cars rather than calorimeters, the
database structure would be exactly the same.
</p><p>
Activities are represented using the same approach: an Activity table
holds instances of records described in the ActivityDescription table.
Inserting a new activity within the work flow is a matter of supplying its
description to the definition table and relating it to its occurrences in
the Activity table. Again, with this design it is possible to describe a
completely different business seamlessly. For mail delivery, for instance,
the definition records could contain the description of the operations to
be done on reception, shunting and delivery, while the Activity table
could contain records with information about when a given operation was
done on which parcel.
</p><p>
The work flow is defined by collecting several activity definitions and
defining the order in which they should be executed. The interface
software then checks that the activity being executed at a given
time follows, in the work-flow definition, the last completed activity
performed on a part. Activities can be skipped or repeated according
to the interface software.
</p><p>
For quality control data we adopted the same homomorphic pattern by adding
a further level of abstraction. We defined characteristics as data
collected during a given activity performed on a part. The Characteristics
table, however, does not store actual values, because they can be of a
different nature&mdash;strings, numbers or even more complex types. The
Characteristics table simply is a collection of keys: one of them links
the characteristics to its definition in the charDefinition table. Actual
characteristics are kept in separate tables according to their type.
</p><p>
Our process has three data types: single floating-point numbers,
triplets of numbers and strings. The length of a crystal, for example, is
a single number and is stored in the Value table. Some measurements
are taken at different points along the crystal axis and in different
conditions. The optical transmission, for one, is measured every 2cm
at different wavelengths. It constitutes a triplet, the first number
representing the position, the second the wavelength and the third the
transmission. Each triplet is stored as a record in the multiValue table.
The same is true for strings: operators perform a visual inspection
of each crystal before manipulation, and they may provide comments to
illustrate possible defects. In Tables 3 through 7, we show the above-mentioned tables for characteristics representation. The part
33101000018045 has been measured for length and transmission (TTO). Length
is 229.7815mm in table value. The char_id field is 134821 pointing
in the Characteristics table to charDefinition_id=6 corresponding
to crystal length. The TTO is a set of triplets in the multiValue
table. The visual inspection of that crystal resulted in the comment
nonhomogeneous in the charValue table.

Again, this method makes REDACLE qualified for different types of
businesses;
in a dairy it could be used to record the bacterial load for each batch of
milk, besides the producer (a character string), as characteristics.
In addition, a completely new data type, such as pictures or sounds, could be
added to the database without disturbing the schema simply by defining a
new table. Adding pictures, for instance, implies
the creation of a table with three fields: primary key, picture data as
a BLOB and the relation to the Characteristics table, which is expressed by an
integer ID. The MySQL code to create such a table is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE picture (
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        data BLOB,
        char_id INT,
        INDEX (char_id),
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeba580.0x153d4d0"></a>
REDACLE Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>
In our application, humans interact with the database in a multitude of
ways&mdash;with the MySQL client, C++ and Java programs, Perl scripts and PHP
scripts through Web pages. The use of a Web browser to render a graphical
user interface (GUI) provides considerable advantages. The GUI is
portable and does not require installation of specific components, no
time is wasted on graphics, and the Web browser environment is well
known by now to both operators or customers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7179f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A set of five crystals being measured
to determine their dimensions. Instruments need to report
their measurements to the work-flow management system.
</p></div></div><p>
Another significant feature of REDACLE is its interface to
other machines. During the calorimeter construction process, automatic
machines take measurements of crystals and other parts without any human
support (Figure 2). These machines, then, must be able to interact with
REDACLE to learn the right sequence of operations to perform, to inform it about
the start and the end time of the operations and to provide data to be
stored as characteristics.
</p><p>
Our goal was to create a system that would allow almost any device to interact
with REDACLE. We avoided imposing a given programming
language or providing libraries for all the possible devices,
because it does not scale with the market. Furthermore, some devices
can be embedded systems with proprietary software.
</p><p>
We developed a d&aelig;mon called the Instrument Agent (IA) to act as
an interface between REDACLE and instruments. The IA is a process that
connects to an Internet port and is able to read ASCII characters
and write them to that port. Instruments are required only to be able
to connect to the network and send strings over the connection.
</p><p>
The sequence of operations is as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
After connecting, an instrument declares the part on which it is operating.
</p></li><li><p>
The IA queries the REDACLE database and searches for the last completed
activity for that part in the work flow. The command the instrument
should execute is stored in the database as a description field in the
activityDefinition table.
</p></li><li><p>
The IA sends the instrument the proper command.
</p></li><li><p>
Upon recognition of the command, the instrument executes it, and the
IA inserts a new activity in the REDACLE database after acknowledgement.
</p></li><li><p>
At the end of the job, the IA updates the activity just inserted,
marks it as FINISHED and gets the data from the instrument as
XML-formatted strings.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The result of the activity may contain both multiValue and
charValue fields. Single values are formatted as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;RE&gt;&lt;FI&gt;field name&lt;VA&gt;field value&lt;/VA&gt;&lt;/FI&gt;...&lt;/RE&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
&lt;RE&gt; stands for result, &lt;FI&gt; is field and &lt;VA&gt; is value. From the
field name, the instrument agent obtains the characteristics definition
ID and fills in the appropriate table according to the field value format
(value for numbers and charValue for strings).
The multiValue table is populated if the result is of the form:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;RE&gt;&lt;NT&gt;ntuple name
&lt;FI&gt;field name&lt;VA&gt;field value&lt;/VA&gt;&lt;/FI&gt;
...
&lt;/NT&gt;&lt;/RE&gt;

</pre>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeba580.0x153f0f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
&lt;NT&gt; here stands for n-tuple, a collection of n elements.
</p><p>
Instrument software developers need not have
knowledge of the details of the REDACLE database; they simply have
to be instructed on the string formats to be used. No libraries
to link to the program are prescribed, nor files to be included.
The programming language is not imposed. The only requirement
is to be able to provide a network connection to the IA.
</p><p>
Besides the GUI and instrument interfaces, we developed a set of ancillary
command-line scripts for administrators and coordinators. In addition, we
created
a small library to run C++ programs and Perl scripts over the database
without needing to formulate SQL queries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeba580.0x153f2b0"></a>
Experience and Perspectives</h2></div></div><p>
REDACLE was released in our laboratory four months after the first
discussions of the project were held. The whole system contains about 10,000
lines of code in Perl, C++, PHP and Java.
The resources needed to run the software are small compared to the
ones requested by the former system, hosted on a dual 800MHz Pentium
III server. That system saturated the CPU at about 100% and occupied
almost all of the 512MB of RAM. We also needed to upgrade all the client
PCs, doubling their memories to support Java GUIs. So we planned a server
upgrade to a dual 1GHz Pentium III with 1GB of RAM to improve the
performance of the previous system.
When using REDACLE, we discovered, amazingly enough, that CPU load was negligible and the average
memory usage was 140&ndash;200MB.
</p><p>
It became clear that we had a need for tools to import from or export to the
previous database, which still was used in other labs. These tools were
built in Perl quickly, to read or write XML files, and we were
able to import all the old data into REDACLE in one day.
</p><p>
Currently, we have about 13,000 parts in the database. The stored
characteristics are 97,000, each of which may be composed of several
values, for a total database size of 50MB. Out of the 15 tables
the multiValue table, containing more than 1,000,000 records, is the
largest at 41MB.
</p><p>
But the most spectacular result was obtained by comparing the time spent
by operators in the calorimeter assembling. Before the introduction of
REDACLE, 25% of the operators' time was wasted in the interaction with
the work-flow manager. Using REDACLE, the interaction between operators
and the database takes a negligible amount of time, improving the overall
detector assembling efficiency.
</p><p>
Moreover, operators soon familiarized themselves with REDACLE's flexibility and
started requesting new tools and interfaces. What before required weeks
to develop or might have been almost impossible to build,
now can be implemented in a short time with REDACLE and LAMP&mdash;between a few
hours and two or three days.
</p><p>
The extraordinary flexibility of the REDACLE database design makes
it practical for many different business processes and industrial
applications, clearly illustrating how open-source software can be
superior to proprietary offerings. In the future, we plan to support even more
complex work-flow models as well as a library of frequently used queries
and functions to be employed in the development of other REDACLE-based
projects.
