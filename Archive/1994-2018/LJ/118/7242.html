DIY-IT: How Linux and Open Source Are Bringing Do-It-Yourself to Information
Technology</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">

Follow the conventional IT media and you'll miss the new level
of self-reliance and participation in Linux at companies large
and small. Executives from Ernie Ball,
Morgan Stanley and Ticketmaster explain the shift to &ldquo;do-it-yourself&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x186b348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Without a doubt, Linux and open source are changing
IT (Information Technology) at companies of every size. But
how? When you read the IT magazines, go to the IT conferences and listen to
the IT analysts, you get the same message you got ten or twenty years ago:
vendors are in charge.
</p><p>
Of the 62 stories in Computerworld.com's current Week In
Review (mid-November 2003), 51 stories, or 82%, are either about vendors&mdash;&ldquo;Red Hat goes Live with
Fedora&rdquo;&mdash;or refer to vendors in their headlines&mdash;&ldquo;IBM's Palmisano
says US must innovate to keep jobs.&rdquo;
In reality, though, vendors' and
customers' IT worlds are steeped in a variety of development
communities. Both vendors and customers develop goods for
themselves, as well as for sale and for use by the rest of
the world.
</p><p>
Over the past year, I've been on assignment by <i  >Linux Journal</i> to study
what's really happening in the IT marketplace and the deeper roles
played by Linux and open-source development in that marketplace. My
first report was &ldquo;How Linux Makes Companies Smarter&rdquo; <a href="../111/6585.html" target="_self">/article/6585</a>, in the July 2003
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.
This second report focuses on changes in IT itself.
What I've found is an increasing reliance on personal and development
community initiative and the freedom and trust making that possible. In
sum, what I'm seeing is a do-it-yourself movement in companies
everywhere, a growth in self-reliance I'm calling
Do-It-Yourself IT (DIY-IT).
</p><p>
Phil Moore, the Executive Director of Enterprise
Application Infrastructure for Morgan Stanley and Company, explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Open source has lowered the threshold at which do-it-yourself is
possible. You can't do everything with building blocks from vendors.
They pretend they're selling you a prefab building and they're not.
They're selling you pipes and fittings and stuff to put it together.
</p><p>
In reality, to build an enterprise, you have to have a set of
experts in your IT shop who can put it all together. Certainly,
historically you need a lot of expertise to get anything done,
because this stuff really isn't easy to put together. But if you've
been led by the vendors to believe that everything dovetails
together nicely, like you see in the .Net ads, or in any major
marketing campaign that promises nirvana, you've got a problem.
</p><p>
You always need a certain amount of do-it-yourselfness. Consultants
don't walk in, deliver an enterprise and walk out, saying &ldquo;call me
in six months for an upgrade.&rdquo; It's organic. An enterprise is
changing constantly. Even the walls in your house right now are on
their way to needing another paint job.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Although DIY-IT involves a reduction in dependency on vendors, it doesn't
mean vendors are bad or that they don't play extremely important
roles in the marketplace. It does mean that the
marketplace no longer belongs to them. It means a new balance
of power exists between supply and demand as does a new division of
responsibilities between vendor, customer and development communities.
It seems the software business is growing up.
</p><p>
In this report, we look at several key factors involved in the DIY-IT
movement: what
leadership really means, the role of the Net, the rewards of
courage, the cost-savings imperative, valuing talent, where we
stand, untold stories and perspective.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x186b9d0"></a>
Follow Which Leader?</h2></div></div><p>
Looking to leaders for leadership is natural. But what about
the leadership of developments that have no direct leader&mdash;developments where the
leadership comes largely from within, from shared conviction and the
practices that express it?
</p><p>
That's what we have with Linux, with free software and with open source.
Linux is a development project, not a company. It is not contained by a
corporate structure. Like a tectonic plate, it is held together by
cohesion more than by organizational forces. Free software and open source
are value systems and development methodologies. To treat them strictly
as populations or as classes of goods is to miss the nature and scope
of what they're about.
</p><p>
The Net not only supports much of what we now take for granted
in the technical world, it puts everybody and everything in a
position to get more connected, more informed, more intelligent.
Public bits outsmart secret ones, even if secret ones still
have economic and other forms of value.
</p><p>
Craig McLane, VP of Technology at Ticketmaster, puts it this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The best thing about the Internet, to me, is it mitigates
tremendously the friction imposed by time and distance. You can take
people who have individual passions and great talents, unite
them and eliminate many of the obstacles to communications.
</p><p>
The Open Source community truly is global, and that matters an awful
lot to us. We're an international company and we like access to very
smart people worldwide as we grow&mdash;people who still are accessible and
relatively close-knit.
</p><p>
The notion that you can take part in this community, do great
things, be supported and foster this whole breeding ground of
innovation is absolutely incredible.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x186bd98"></a>
The Networked IT World</h2></div></div><p>
Trying to imagine a civilized corporate or governmental
organization today that is not sustained by the Net, and therefore also
by open-source software, is almost impossible. Organizations everywhere also
are coming to recognize that they depend on open-source values as well as
open-source talent and code. In just the last year it became clear to governments
around the world that their computing infrastructure needed to be built
on stuff that is open, that has no secrets. They want to be able to
inspect it to make sure it's sound, reliable and open to improvement.
</p><p>
Take Sterling Ball, the leader and namesake of Ernie Ball, the guitar
string maker. You can't press SCAN on
the car radio without hearing an Ernie Ball string.
What makes Sterling Ball an open-source revolutionary isn't
his technical chops, it's his independence&mdash;his guts. This
became evident after Ernie Ball was raided in 2000 by federal
marshals as part of an unannounced software audit by the
Business Software Alliance (BSA), which found
unauthorized &ldquo;pirated&rdquo; software on some of Ernie
Ball's computers. The BSA still brags about the raid on
its Web site. Here's how Sterling Ball described it when I
interviewed him at LinuxWorld in August 2003:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A disgruntled ex-employee saw a nail-your-butt opportunity, so he
called the BSA. I was sued under federal seal. There was no warning.
We were raided at 10 am on a Friday. We were shut down and
ordered not to touch our computers. There were armed marshals. Our
employees were sitting there going &ldquo;What's the matter? Is our
company criminal? Are we crooks?&rdquo; Then they sent out press
releases....It's coincidental that they always send these out after
a business is closed.
</p><p>
We're the number one employer in terms of manufacturing in San Luis
Obispo. We're a big fish in a little pond. The headline reads,
&ldquo;Ernie Ball Raided for Piracy&rdquo;, and the story says, &ldquo;Company
officials unavailable for comment&rdquo;. Well, no [surprise]. I was at home.
And I never say &ldquo;No comment&rdquo;. So, when it came time to tell my
story, I said, &ldquo;They came for bear and got squirrel.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ernie Ball went to court and paid a fine, but that didn't end the matter:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The worst thing was when Microsoft printed a four-color reproduction
of that newspaper article on an executive's desk, sent it to every
registered Microsoft user and said &ldquo;Don't get caught like Ernie
Ball&mdash;a fine company that found out just how hard it is to stay
compliant. Call us. We'll give you a free audit and sell you
software at 20% off.&rdquo; Keep in mind that we already had downloaded
the BSA self-auditing software and it didn't work. This was
fear-based marketing, with government help.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Sterling Ball didn't get mad or get even&mdash;he got out:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Everybody thought I was crazy. The IT people thought they were going
to get fired. I said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, because I've never seen any greater
programming in the world than &ldquo;You can't do business unless you've
got an office suite on your desk.&rdquo; Hey, I'm talking here at
LinuxWorld because I changed my word processor. The solution everybody
[at our company] uses is a cocktail of open-source stuff. Nobody
showed us how to do it. We had to figure it out ourselves.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Today Ernie Ball's servers run Red Hat Linux. Its desktops are GNOME on
thin Sun clients, with applications that run off a Linux server. The company
time clock and security software run on Linux. The company e-mail is
Ximian's Evolution, and their office suite is OpenOffice.org.
</p><p>
The lesson here isn't about technology.
The lesson is about
independence, integrity and the courage to break free of mental
programming.
It's
a lesson about the souls of individuals, of organizations and of a
marketplace that still thinks vendors are in charge, even though the
success of the Net and the Open Source movement prove they are not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x186c5d8"></a>
The Cost-Savings Imperative</h2></div></div><p>
Breaking free is akin to awakening, and it doesn't
happen only for companies the size of Ernie Ball. Take Ticketmaster, for
example. Here's Craig McLane again, speaking at LinuxWorld:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We support 8,000 clients in ten countries. In 2002 we sold 95 million
tickets through channels that represented over four billion US
dollars. This puts us in the top 25 of all retail Web
properties&mdash;actually number two, between Dell and Amazon. So we're doing a lot of
business, but on behalf of other people who have entrusted us with
their business.
</p><p>
We have 3,500 outlets, 19 call centers and the Ticketmaster.com Web
site, which does about 50% of our business. We also provide box-office solutions. If you've ever purchased a ticket at a box office,
that's also a Ticketmaster system, with the same inventory bucket.
</p><p>
Our product and technology organization is the cornerstone of
Ticketmaster as a company. We've got 250 people devoted to product
and technology in an organization that has about 2,000 full-time employees.
</p><p>
We provide solutions and systems, but we also support those 8,000
clients. In many cases, because of the nature of the business&mdash;highly customized, highly variable traffic and all kinds of strange
configurations that actually are much different from any other
retail businesses&mdash;there are no commercial solutions available for
what we need to do.
</p><p>
In fact, we are one of the first application service providers:
extending the service to thousands of clients, actually writing the
code, hosting the system, providing the customer service and
charging a fee per unit sold. We have to build high-volume systems
for very specific and peculiar businesses. Open source allows us to
do [this] as well or better&mdash;at least in our experience&mdash;at half the
price of commercial solutions.
</p><p>
That's why Ticketmaster converted the Ticketmaster.com site
primarily to open-source technologies over the course of the last 18
months.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
McLane showed a small spreadsheet at this point in the talk (Table 1) that
outlined the cost of the company's computing needs in terms of open-source
and proprietary options. He continues:
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1773580.0x186c9a0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Ticketmaster Computing Options</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Ticketmaster Computing Options7242t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Ticketmaster.com</th><th>Open Source</th><th>Proprietary</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>400 PC-based systems</td><td>$1,000,000</td><td>$1,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Operating system</td><td>$0</td><td>$600,000</td></tr><tr><td>Web server software</td><td>$0</td><td>$120,000</td></tr><tr><td>Database software</td><td>$0</td><td>$240,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>$1,000,000</td><td>$1,960,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It's really all about licensing costs. We buy the the same class
of machine, same configuration, from the same vendor. But
we're using all open-source technologies in these areas,
and we pay nothing for licensing. So you can see that
we save 50 cents on every dollar we invest and get the
same or better performance. And we see better support
from the community than we typically get from
commercial vendors.
</p><p>
The Web site costs, in hardware and capital development, a couple
million bucks. So it's a small fractional part. It doesn't
materially change the business from Wall Street's perspective or
from the CFO's perspective. But it matters to us because we can use the money
that's made available to employ more smart people. And
that's really the key.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x1c65748"></a>
Valuing Talent</h2></div></div><p>
To Craig McLane, open-source human resources are collective as well as
individual. To explain, he quotes T. S. Elliot: &ldquo;No poet, no artist of
any art, has his complete meaning alone&rdquo;. He adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
By providing really
robust tools to our people and by pulling in more people who are
interested in solving problems, who can work autonomously, but who
like to have the benefit of a larger community while they're working....
</p><p>
[People like] Stas Beckman are doing core work for us...mod_perl 2.0.
[He's] doing a lot of the work that will benefit the community,
which benefits us. He's also working on database connection
pooling....So we get to take the lead on doing some things that have
broad general benefits for everybody. Geoffrey Young is going to
start working with us. He's going to be working on things that can
be done autonomously, that benefit the community but also provide
immediate benefit for our business when deployed in very specific ways.
</p><p>
Our teams have ownership over their tools. They also don't have an
excuse. They can't say that a vendor doesn't have an answer or isn't
getting back on the phone. Because everybody knows that there's a
community out there and you have access to the source. Everything is
in front of you. So there's an accountability that's reinforced
when you have source code and a community that knows so much and is
so willing to respond.
</p><p>
You're also more motivated. When people pick their tools, the work
invariably makes sense to them. They're also working side by side
with the people creating the tools that we're using day by day. You
can't get that anywhere else.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Once again, a company gets smart and saves money by aligning itself with
its own smart employees and the development communities to
which they belong.
</p><p>
What's different between now and 10 or 20 years ago? McLane says
it's &ldquo;the amplifying effects of the Internet on the power of the
individual&rdquo;, adding, &ldquo;only a fool would ignore that&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x1c65bc0"></a>
Where We Stand</h2></div></div><p>
We read about IT brass going gaga for Linux almost every
day. Ken Harris, CIO of Gap Corp., recently said he's in favor of
&ldquo;Anything touching Linux&rdquo;. Emea Harris of Lehman Brothers
said, &ldquo;We're
very aggressive around migrating to Linux.&rdquo;
</p><p>
When I spoke about DIY-IT at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention
in July 2003, the majority of those attending the talk (about
100 in the room) was rank-and-file IT guys, mostly from
large companies. Phil Moore was one of them. One audience member said
some companies feel that their own open-source developments
give them a competitive edge, and they don't want to talk about it
for that reason. &ldquo;They don't want their competitors to know
how they do it faster and cheaper&rdquo;, she said.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x1c65e28"></a>
Untold Stories</h2></div></div><p>
What other kinds of stories are we not hearing, then? Here are a few,
in no particular order:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Debian: &ldquo;I'm seeing far more Debian than any report gives it
credit for&rdquo;, says one technologist working for a large vendor that
has partnerships with Red Hat and SuSE. &ldquo;Red Hat and SuSE may sell
more, so they show up on surveys that follow sales. But in terms
of actual implementation, Debian is pretty big.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Education: at different periods during the past 30 years,
companies like Digital, Apple, IBM and Microsoft have
had successful programs for getting students hooked
on their goods. Now those students are swimming in a
sea of free software and old or cheap PCs on which to run it. Web services consultant and author Doug Kaye says
&ldquo;High schools and colleges are now all about open
source....It's LAMP everywhere.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
The power of gravy: a number of IT people have told me that
vendor relationships are valued highly, period, and always
will be. &ldquo;You get freebies. Tickets to games. Free dinners. Trips
to conferences. A lot of people love that gravy train.&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
Small consultant opportunities: one IT guy at a large company told me:
</p></li></ul></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>

The do-it-yourself movement inside IT is lowering the barriers to entry
for small contractors too. Thirty years ago, big companies went to big
vendors for big solutions. That's not the case anymore. You've got small
vendors and consultants with 15, 20 or 40 people going in and delivering
hugely successful solutions to Fortune 50 companies.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Phil Moore adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When you contract for an open-source solution, all the middle layers
of the contracting nightmare you get when you go through big vendors are
gone. If you contract for a simple change from a big vendor, you can be
in for spending a lot of money. The cheapest vendor contract I've ever
been involved with is a half-million dollars. At the very least you've got
two gigantic legal departments involved to begin with, just to negotiate
the contract. Yet I've gone and got similar order-of-magnitude
technology changes on open-source products for below five figures.
This is a gold mine. This frees up a huge part of my budget. And
time-wise the process is highly streamlined.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1773580.0x1c665b8"></a>
Perspective</h2></div></div><p>
Without vendors, we wouldn't have magazines or tradeshows, to name
two of my favorite things. It's important to the market's ecology for
vendors to push their goods and tell their stories. The problem we've
had&mdash;and still have&mdash;is a long lag between what's happening in the
marketplace and how we cover the subject. And I believe that lag derives
from the young ages of the industries involved.
The computer industry is about 50 years old. The software industry is
half that age. The Internet&mdash;which changed everything&mdash;began
supporting business only about nine years ago.
What we need are more stories from the demand side of the marketplace
and more courage by those in positions to tell them. We also need
publications that welcome those stories, with authors and editors and
analysts to help tell them.
</p><p>
My friend Christopher Lydon (<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon" target="_self">blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon</a>), a
former reporter for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> and host of
NPR's &ldquo;Connections&rdquo;,
believes what's happening in our industry&mdash;this DIY-IT movement&mdash;is
profoundly Emersonian. He points to this encouraging prose from the
author's seminal essay, &ldquo;Self-Reliance&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm" target="_self">www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true for you in
your private heart is true for all men, that is genius. Speak your
latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the
inmost in due time becomes the outmost....There is a time in every
man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is
ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for
better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is
full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but
through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to
him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and
none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know
until he has tried.
