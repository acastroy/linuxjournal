Asterisk Open-Source PBX System</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">

Use one system to manage voice over IP and conventional phone lines,
manage voice mail and run CGI-like applications for phone users.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a8298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
So, you need to deploy a Private Branch eXchange (PBX) system for your
small office. Or, maybe you want a voice-mail system running on your Linux box
at home. What about an interactive voice response (IVR) system
for home automation? Voice over IP (VoIP) capabilities would be nice too.
How do you do it? One very interesting and powerful solution is
Asterisk, a GPLed PBX system built on Linux that bridges the
gap between traditional telephony, such as your telephone line,
and VoIP. Asterisk also supports a host
of other features that make it an attractive solution. In
this article, I touch on some of these features and
give you enough information to get started without having to
buy any special hardware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a83a0"></a>
Background</h2></div></div><p>
Asterisk is an open-source project
sponsored by Digium. The primary maintainer is Mark
Spencer, but numerous patches have been contributed
from the community. As of this writing, it
runs only on Linux for Intel, although there was some
success in the past with Linux PPC, and an
effort is underway to port Asterisk to *BSD. Digium also
sells various hardware components that operate with
Asterisk (see Resources). These components are PCI cards that
connect standard analog
phone lines to your computer. Other hardware is
supported as well, such as hardware from Dialogic
and Quicknet. Asterisk has its own VoIP protocol,
called IAX, but it also supports SIP and H.323. This
leads us to one of Asterisk's most powerful
features: its ability to connect different
technologies within the same feature-rich
environment.
For example, you could have IAX, SIP,
H.323 and a regular telephone line connecting
through Asterisk (see Figure 1&mdash;courtesy of Digium).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6769f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Asterisk can connect regular telephone lines and
multiple VoIP standards.
</p></div></div><p>
The developer can extend Asterisk by working with
the C API or by using AGIs, which are analogous to
CGI scripts. AGIs can be written in any language and are
executed as an external process. They are the
easiest and most flexible way to extend Asterisk's
capabilities (see Listing 1).

Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
An official release hasn't happened for quite a
while, but there is talk of one coming.
Currently, the best way to get Asterisk is by CVS:

<pre     class="programlisting">

export CVSROOT=\
:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.digium.com:/usr/cvsroot
cvs login (password is "anoncvs")
cvs co asterisk

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a8a80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you plan on using a PCI card from Digium,
you should look at zaptel as well. If you
plan on having connectivity, you need
to check out libpri.
</p><p>
There is no configure script, so you simply use make.
You also need readline, OpenSSL and
Linux 2.4.x with the kernel sources
installed in order to compile Asterisk properly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd asterisk
make clean install samples
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a8c38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This compiles Asterisk, installs it and also
installs the sample configuration files. The last
target overwrites any existing configuration
files, so either skip this target or back up any
existing configuration files if you want to
preserve them. If you are using zaptel or ISDN,
compile those before compiling Asterisk. Asterisk
is installed in /usr/sbin/ with the configuration
files in /etc/asterisk/ by default. Voice-mail messages
are stored in /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail/.
CDRs for billing and log files are located under
/var/log/asterisk/.
</p><p>
You can start Asterisk by typing <tt  >asterisk</tt>
at the command line. However, the best way to use
Asterisk during the testing phase is to run it with
the -vvvc options. The -vvv option is extra-verbose
output, and the -c option gives you a console
prompt, which allows you to interact
with the Asterisk process. For example, you can
submit commands to Asterisk, such as management
and status commands.
</p><p>
Asterisk's operation and functionality relies on
several configuration files. We discuss three
of them in this article, but several
others exist.
Here, we set up Asterisk so that
users can call each other through IAX. We also
set up voice mail and give users a way to manage
their voice-mail messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a8e48"></a>
The Dialplan</h2></div></div><p>
Before getting into the setup of Asterisk, we
should have a general understanding of the dialplan. It
is flexible and powerful but also can be
confusing. The dialplan is used to define number translations
and routing and, therefore, is the heart of Asterisk.
The dialplan defines contexts, which are
containers for extensions (digit patterns) that
provide specific functionality. For instance, you
may want to provide a context for people who are in
your office or home, so that they have certain
dialing privileges. You also could set up an
external or guest context that allows only limited
dialing capabilities, such as no long distance.
Context names are enclosed by brackets ([]). The
extensions associated with the context follow the
name.
</p><p>
Each extension can have several steps (priorities)
associated with it. The call flow continues
sequentially unless an application returns -1, the
call is terminated or the application redirects the
call flow. The syntax of an extension entry looks
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

exten =&gt; &lt;exten&gt;,&lt;priority&gt;,&lt;application(args)&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a9000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Below are a couple of examples:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exten =&gt; 9911,1,Wait(1)
exten =&gt; 9911,2,Dial(Zap/1/${EXTEN:1})
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a9160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
An extension is denoted by using <tt  >exten =&gt;</tt>.
In this example, 9911 is the extension; 1 and 2 are
the priorities or step numbers (these need to be
sequential); and Wait and Dial are the
applications. Asterisk uses applications to
process each step within an extension. You can get
help for the different applications from the
Asterisk console by typing <tt  >show applications</tt> to
list the supported applications and
<tt  >show application &lt;application&gt;</tt> to display the help
message.
</p><p>
Extension matching can be done on the dialed number
as well as the calling number. This allows for
greater flexibility when processing calls. Patterns
also can be used, and these are preceded with an underscore (_):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
N&mdash;a single digit between 2 and 9.
</p></li><li><p>
X&mdash;a single digit between 0 and 9.
</p></li><li><p>
[12-4]&mdash;any digit within the brackets.
</p></li><li><p>
.  &mdash;wild card.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a96e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For example, the extension _NXX5551212 would match
any information number, regardless of area code.
</p><p>
Extensions can be any alphanumeric string.
Some special characters are built-in:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
s&mdash;start here when no dialed digits are received,
as from an incoming call from an analog line.
</p></li><li><p>
t&mdash;used when a timeout occurs.
</p></li><li><p>
i&mdash;used for invalid dialed digits.
</p></li><li><p>
o&mdash;operator extension.
</p></li><li><p>
h&mdash;hangup extension.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a9c08"></a>
Creating IAX Users</h2></div></div><p>
The first file we create is the iax.conf file
(see Listing 2). This file controls the
operation of the IAX protocol and defines
users of the protocol. The protocol has two versions. The old one is
IAX, and the new one is
IAX2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a05a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. iax.conf File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

[general]
port=5036
bindaddr=0.0.0.0
amaflags=default
accountcode=home

[brett]
type=friend
host=dynamic
secret=brettsecret
context=cg1
callerid="brett &lt;111&gt;"

[maria]

callerid="maria &lt;222&gt;"

[niko]
type=friend
host=dynamic
secret=nikosecret
context=cg2
accountcode=external
callerid="Niko &lt;333&gt;"

</pre></div><p>
The first section of the configuration file is the
general section, which defines parameters for the
IAX protocol. Four parameters are listed, but
others can be defined as well. The port parameter is
the port number over which IAX will communicate. It
defaults to 5036, so strictly speaking, that entry
is not needed. You can use the bindaddr parameter to
tell Asterisk to bind to a particular IP address&mdash;for machines with multiple Ethernet cards. A
bindaddr of 0.0.0.0 attempts to bind to all IP
addresses. The parameters amaflags and accountcode
are used for CDRs. When they are defined in the
general section, they are used as the default
values. You also can define them on a per-user
basis. The values that amaflags can accept are
billing, documentation, omit and default.
accountcode can be an arbitrary value. For this
setup, I use home for users local to my
LAN and external for users
outside of my LAN. Several other
parameters have been omitted, but most of them
are performance parameters.
</p><p>
The remaining sections are user definitions. I have
three users: brett, maria and niko. The type definition has
three possible values: a peer can receive
calls, a user can place calls and a friend can
do both. I have defined all of them as type friend.
I defined all of the hosts as being dynamic, but if
any host has a static IP address, you can
specify that instead. secret is the password
the user must provide when connecting to this
Asterisk server. Two contexts are used in this
file for users: [cg1] and [cg2]. I explain
these in more detail when discussing
the extensions.conf file, but effectively, these contexts enable
the dialing privileges for the user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a0860"></a>
Setting Up Voice Mail</h2></div></div><p>
The next file is voicemail.conf (Listing 3).
Again, it has a general section that deals with
general or global parameters for voice mail. The
first parameter, format, lists the audio format of
the messages. The next two parameters are used for
e-mail notification: serveremail is the source
e-mail address (from field), and attach instructs
Asterisk to attach the message to the e-mail.
In our example, we do not want the message
attached. Again, some parameters
have been omitted.
</p><p>
&lt;mbox&gt; is the number used to save and access messages
for the user. This is also used in extensions.conf
for directing the call flow to the proper voice-mail
box. The &lt;passwd&gt; parameter is needed when checking
messages. &lt;name&gt; is the name of the user. &lt;email&gt;
and &lt;pager&gt; are e-mail addresses that are used to
send message notifications. The pager e-mail has a
shorter message, because it needs to be read on
smaller devices (pagers and cell phones). Many
mobile and pager providers have e-mail gateways that
can deliver the message to the device.

Defining Extensions</h2></div></div><p>
The last file that we examine here is the
extensions.conf file (Listing 4). This is one
of the most involved files because it contains the
dialplan. The dialplan in my example is rather
simple compared to its capabilities. This file has
a general and global section. The general section
is similar to the general section in the previous
files; it defines general parameters. I don't define
any general parameters in this example. The global
section is used to define global variables. These
variables can be accessed in the dialplan by using
the syntax <tt  >${VARIABLE}</tt>. I have defined one variable:
TIMEOUT is the answer timeout.
Built-in variables also can be used within the
dialplan, such as, CONTEXT, EXTEN and CALLERID.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a0d30"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

include =&gt; voicemail

[cg2]
include =&gt; afterhours|1:00-6:00|*|*|*
include =&gt; iax

</pre></div><p>
All of the other sections are context definitions.
A context is simply a grouping of digit patterns.
Here I have defined several contexts that
define dialing scenarios: voicemail,
iax and afterhours. Think of these as
individual or mini-dialplans. I then define two
contexts that I assign to the users. These
inherit the capabilities of the other contexts
I already have defined by using the include
keyword.
</p><p>
The first context, voicemail, lists the digit
patterns that allow users to access their
voice-mail messages. Users can dial 6245, and the
application VoicemailMain2 prompts them for the
mailbox number and password. Users then
can manage (listen to, delete and so on) the messages in their
mailbox.
</p><p>
The iax context is used for PBX dialing between
IAX users. We have defined various extensions for
each of the users. An entry with the name
of the user (maria) redirects to the
extension number entry. For the 111 extension, I
also match on callerid. If the callerid matches,
I change the callerid name so it has a
relative meaning. For example, if the extension
dialed is 111, and the callerid is 222, the
callerid name is changed to &ldquo;it's your wife!&rdquo;.
This message
shows up on my client whenever my wife calls me
(I won't get into how I use this to my advantage).
</p><p>
The last digit pattern context is used for calls
that arrive during late hours. Because I don't want
to be disturbed at night by external users, I
match on any dialed number (_.). It waits for one
second and then answers the call. After it answers,
it plays a background message so the caller
can choose for which person to leave a message (&ldquo;for brett, press 1&rdquo;). So, if the caller
presses 1, the call proceeds to the
1,1,Voicemail2(111) entry, which sends the user to
the 111 mailbox. This is a simple illustration
of how you could construct an IVR system.
</p><p>
The [cg1] and [cg2] contexts include functionality I
already have defined inside other contexts. This
allows me to create different user groups easily.
For example, [cg1] has all of the capabilities I
have defined, but [cg2] has only the iax capabilities
and gets directed to voice mail during late hours.
Powerful dialing capabilities can be constructed
by utilizing the flexibility of Asterisk's dialplan.
My example has shown only a glimpse of the
possibilities. You also can simplify the
dialplan by using macros, but I leave that as
an exercise for the reader.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b0580.0x25a11a8"></a>
Using AGI</h2></div></div><p>
In the extensions.conf file, an entry called callerid.agi
calls an AGI script. This is
a simple example illustrating the AGI
interface. The script is placed in the /var/lib/
asterisk/agi-bin/ directory and is invoked by
Asterisk as an external process. AGI and
Asterisk communicate through stdin, stdout and stderr.
Variables are passed in to the AGI through stdin, and
the AGI can pass information back to Asterisk through
stdout. Messages destined for the Asterisk console
are written to stderr. Two
parameters always are passed to the AGI: the full path to the
AGI and the arguments that are passed to the AGI
through the exten entry. The AGI collects the
callerid and sends it to a GUI application
running on another machine. The GUI application can
be retrieved from my Web site (see Figure 2). AGI
scripts also can be used to retrieve information.
If you need to query a database for information
about the call or the user, you can use the
AGI interface as well.

Making a Call</h2></div></div><p>
So, what can we do now? After creating the
configuration files above and starting
Asterisk (<tt  >asterisk -vvvc</tt>), we can try some calls. Currently, the availability of IAX soft clients
is limited. SIP soft clients, including kphone and
xten, and hard clients from Cisco, SNOM and other vendors also are
available
that will work with Asterisk, but I
concentrate on using IAX in this article. Gnophone
(Figure 3) is the oldest client and was
developed by Digium. Work also is being done on a
cross-platform client, as well as a Windows client.
Another client is available that belongs to the tel
Project at SourceForge. I have modified the user
interface to that client (Figure 4). It is
still alpha software, but it's functional. In fact, I
used this client to establish a call between
Germany (Reinhard Max), Australia (Steve Landers)
and the US (me). Whichever client you choose, you
need to define your user name, password and
context for each Asterisk server with which you want to
connect. Then, you can call anyone
defined in the iax.conf file (if the dialplan
is set up correctly). So, if I want to call
my wife, I simply dial 222, or I can type
<tt  >maria</tt> (because I have defined this in the
dialplan). If I want to check my voice-mail messages,
I can dial 6245.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I have touched on only a few of Asterisk's capabilities, but this article should give the reader a glimpse
of Asterisk's potential. Asterisk scales well
from small setups to larger and more complex
configurations. For example, Asterisk servers in
different locations can be connected through
the IAX protocol, creating a virtual PBX. Because
Asterisk runs on Linux you can leverage existing
tools to help interface and manage Asterisk. For
instance, you could have Web access to the CDRs,
configuration files and voice mail. In fact,
a CGI script comes with Asterisk that allows
you to access your voice-mail messages with a Web
browser. I encourage readers to
