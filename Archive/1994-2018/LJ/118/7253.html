If you're considering switching to a new distribution or purchasing some
new hardware, stop by our on-line product review section first.

Trying to keep up with all the new product announcements that come
across our desks would be a full-time job. Luckily, we have a pool of
reviewers who take on much of the responsibility for trying out new
hardware, software, books, games and every type of gadget they can get
their hands on. Because we have only enough print space to run one or
two reviews per issue, the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site has become our best
source for reviews.
</p><p>
The much shorter time frame involved in getting articles published on the
Web makes our Web site an ideal place to post reviews of new
distribution releases. The final Fedora Core 1 release arrived early in
November 2003, and within a week, Adam Jenkins' &ldquo;Fedora at a
Glance&rdquo; was
posted on our site (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7257" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7257</a>). Adam shared his
experiences with downloading and installing Fedora and then discussed
Fedora's features&mdash;what it had, what it didn't have and what was on its
way. As more users probably will be making the switch to Fedora in the
coming months, Adam's article provides some insight into what they'll be
getting when they make the move.
</p><p>
If you're thinking about giving Gentoo a try, Sean Bossinger's &ldquo;Gentoo
Linux&rdquo; product review is worth a read
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7002" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7002</a>). Sean focuses his review on
Gentoo's
installation process, which is more manual than the
commercial distributions. The upside of the manual input is you can
optimize the compiled code for the settings specific to your system,
which is part of Gentoo's goal of being a highly customizable distribution. The
downside is all that customization can take quite a bit of time to
achieve.
</p><p>
If you're still riding the Opteron wave, check out Steve Hastings'
review of the &ldquo;Appro Rackmount Dual Opteron Server&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6883" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6883</a>). Or if you're looking for something
a bit more fun, something in the way of a gadget, we recently reviewed
two Linux handheld devices. Apparently the really cool PDAs aren't
available in the US; luckily, you can order them on the Web from
international resellers. The Yopy 3700 that Guylhem Aznar reviewed
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6933" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6933</a>) was ordered through a French
reseller. Although it looks good and has a better keyboard, Guylhem
isn't sure the Yopy is a better purchase than a Zaurus. And Tony
Steidler-Dennison's review of the Sharp Zaurus SL-C760 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7162" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7162</a>) certainly makes
it sound like this is the coolest Zaurus and the coolest PDA ever. Its
superior screen display and its ability to function in either landscape
or desktop mode, thanks to a pivot hinge, might be enough to convince
you that you need one.

I haven't even mentioned all the book reviews you can browse
on our site. So before you lay out any money on new purchases,
visit the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site and click on Product Review
or Book Reviews under Topics. If you're interested in joining
our reviewers mailing list and helping us test all this stuff,
send me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.
