For some retailers, e-books now are outselling paper books.
E-book readers put a library in your hand&mdash;it may be time for you to make the plunge into e-books.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x298d580.0x2a85250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'd never given e-readers much thought before. I've been reading e-texts
on portable computers since I was in college in 1991 (I started on an HP
95LX Palmtop reading Project Gutenberg texts), so spending additional
money on a dedicated device didn't make much sense to me. After all,
I'd gone from the HP Palmtop PCs (95, 100 and 200LXs), to a Palm V,
to a Palm LifeDrive, to a BlackBerry Curve, and I ended up using Stanza
on the iPhone. I'm a fairly voracious reader&mdash;I read a book every
week or ten days&mdash;so the idea of having to carry &ldquo;yet another
device&rdquo;
to get my literary fix just didn't sound like a great plan. As a result,
I automatically discounted the Kindle, Nook and other e-readers due to
their lack of utility, until a friend suggested I give the Nook a closer
look. I'm glad I did; I was rather surprised by what I found.

What's a Nook, Anyway?</h2></div></div><p>
The Barnes &amp; Noble Nook is an e-reader with a monochrome electronic ink (E Ink)
screen, much like its primary competition, the Amazon Kindle. However,
the Nook has one major distinguishing feature at first glance: a smaller,
color, touchscreen below the primary E Ink screen. This little touchscreen
serves as navigation device, virtual keyboard and optional page-flipping
mechanism. There also are four hardware buttons on either side of the
screen dedicated to page forward/reverse, which makes the Nook friendly for
left-handed users. The Nook comes in two hardware models: one with Wi-Fi and
3G, and one with Wi-Fi only. It weighs about 12 ounces, and it's approximately
7.7" long, 5" wide and .5" thick. It reminds me of a
Moleskine notebook in dimension, and I actually picked up a cover for the
Nook that makes it look like one. The primary E Ink display is 600x800
&ldquo;pixels&rdquo; and measures 6" diagonally, while the secondary color
touchscreen is 480x144 and measures 3.5" diagonally. Battery life
on the Nook is impressive, running close to ten days of average use time
if the wireless is turned off (two days with wireless on). This is due
in large part to the E Ink screen, which uses power only when changing
pixels on the display&mdash;it costs nothing to keep the display
&ldquo;lit&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The 3G access (on 3G-capable Nooks) is locked to the Barnes &amp; Noble
on-line store <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>. You can't use it to surf the Web
or use other on-line
applications. The 3G is used only for buying books and getting content
from Barnes &amp; Noble's &ldquo;The Daily&rdquo; application, and it
works only in
the country in which you purchase the Nook (Barnes &amp; Noble isn't going to
pick up the tab for international roaming).

Using the Nook</h2></div></div><p>
When you first fire up the Nook after creating your Barnes &amp; Noble
store account and signing in (a mandatory process), you're greeted with
wallpaper on the E Ink screen and several icons on the touchscreen (Figure
3). Each
icon represents a function of the Nook. The Daily is content that Barnes
&amp; Noble updates each day. My Library is where you go to select content
you already own (from the Barnes &amp; Noble store or loaded from a PC). Shop takes you
to the Barnes &amp; Noble on-line store. Reading Now opens your current
book, and Games gives you Sudoku and Chess games. There also is a
Web browser included in the Nook (more on that later). The little n
button between the E Ink screen and the touchscreen serves as a quick
shortcut to take you back to this main menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10900f3.large.jpg"><img src="10900f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The Nook provides a very good reading experience, although it's not without
a bump or two in spots. The E Ink screen is
simply lovely for reading text.
I was very skeptical at first about E Ink technology,
due to the lack of backlight, slow response time and monochrome-only
display. After using it, however, it's simply perfect for an e-reader. It's
easy to read in reasonable lighting, and the response time is 
an issue for e-reading only when flipping pages, where it shows up as a
black flash each time the page-forward button is pushed. The flash
when flipping pages does take a little getting used to, but it's not
terribly bad, and it's a decent trade-off for the excellent readability
and extremely low-power consumption of the screen. The contrast of the
screen improves in better lighting. In sunlight, my wife and I actually
prefer it to a printed page. In Figure 4 you can see what the
experience is like while reading John Scalzi's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Android's
Dream</em></span>
(a hysterical book, by the way). The Nook's size and weight are
just about perfect, and it feels good in your hand as you read. Kudos
to Barnes &amp; Noble for putting duplicate page-forward/-reverse buttons
on both sides of the screen, so readers can switch hands without
hassle. It has features that are expected to be in an e-reader, like
text highlighting, bookmarking and the ability to look up a word in an
onboard dictionary without leaving the book.

</p></div></div><p>
The Nook's on-line store also is easy to use. Simply push the Shop
icon from the main menu, and you're connected to the Barnes &amp; Noble
on-line store&mdash;instantly, via 3G if you're on a 3G-capable Nook;
otherwise,
the Nook needs to be associated with a Wi-Fi access point. You
navigate the store using the lower touchscreen, and the search
results and books are displayed on the E Ink screen. I've been using
touchscreen devices for a while, and I kept wanting to touch the E Ink 
screen to click on things at first, but that instinct didn't take long
to overcome. Once you select a book, either via searching or browsing,
buying it is as simple as clicking Buy Now on the touchscreen, and it's
sent wirelessly to your Nook. An advantage of this is if there's ever an
issue with your Nook and you need to replace it, once your replacement Nook
is re-associated with your Barnes &amp; Noble account, all your content
automatically will be downloaded to the new Nook. Another tidbit about
the Nook store is occasionally there will be offers for freebies if you
take your Nook to a brick-and-mortar Barnes &amp; Noble store. I've seen
offers for free coffee, and Figure 5 shows an offer for
free chocolate. I like free chocolate.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10900f5.large.jpg"><img src="10900f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Using the Nook as a Web browser, unfortunately, represents an exercise in
frustration. The processor is clocked just a little bit too slow to make
for a decent browser. The E Ink screen's response time is abysmal when
trying to select something, but the worst part about the experience is
the split screen. You have to navigate the site using a small
&ldquo;window&rdquo;
of the site as seen through the touchscreen, but you can see the whole
site on the E Ink screen (Figure 6). It gives you a schizophrenic feeling when
trying to navigate a Web page. Sadly, it's just a bad experience. I think
the Barnes &amp; Noble folks tossed a Web browser in the unit because they could, and
it gave them feature parity with the Amazon Kindle. And, I'm not sure
there is a way to improve the experience on the current hardware. 
</p><p>
The
two games that ship with the unit are adequate, although if I'm going to
play a game, I'll reach for my iPhone, laptop or Nintendo DS before I
pick up the Nook. Having the ability to play an MP3 file and listen to
it on speakers or headphones while reading is nice, but it's something I'll
rarely use since I have other devices that play that kind of media better.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Overall, I like the Nook. Since I got my Nook, I've found myself
&ldquo;unplugging&rdquo; from the computer and reading more. I like my Nook so much
that the day after I got mine, I ran back to Barnes &amp; Noble and bought
my wife a Wi-Fi Nook. If I had to make the purchase again, I'd have
gotten a Wi-Fi-only Nook myself, as I've used the 3G to purchase a book
exactly once. The Nook's shortcomings aren't showstoppers to owning one,
unless you need to rely on its Web browsing ability or need the fastest
in screen refresh&mdash;in which case you probably shouldn't get any E Ink
e-reader. It's hard to go wrong with the Wi-Fi Nook at the current $149
price point, and although the extra $50 for the 3G probably won't bankrupt
anyone, it's more gimmicky than functional, as it's not very hard to find
Wi-Fi around for downloading books. At any rate, if you're in the market
for a dedicated e-reader, check out the Nook.

Managing Your Content with Calibre</b></p><p>
Calibre is a cross-platform open-source program that's designed to manage
electronic books and other texts. It'll convert between e-reader formats
as well as PC formats, like PDF and HTML, and it will download cover art
and other e-book attributes automatically from the Internet. It's
really easy to use, and it syncs with the Nook flawlessly. If you have a lot
of pre-existing content in other formats you want to put on your Nook,
Calibre's the only way to go.

Softrooting the Nook</b></p><p>
The Nook is an Android device, and as such, is capable of being
&ldquo;rooted&rdquo;,
giving you full access to the hardware via the removal of
software constraints. The softroot for the Nook is fairly easy to do, and
you can do simply by downloading and installing a couple firmware
bundles. After your Nook's been softrooted, you'll have the ability to
change the launcher's main menu icons, as well as install other Android
apps like Pandora. There are a couple Nook-specific applications as
well: Trook (a way to download books you already own via Wi-Fi
outside of the Barnes &amp; Noble store) and Twook (a Twitter client with
many of the same faults as the Web browser app). Note that at the time of this
writing, new Nooks with serial numbers starting in the 1003 series are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> compatible with the current softroot. Take care and check with the
NookDevs site (see Resources) before attempting a softroot. If
in doubt, don't do it!
