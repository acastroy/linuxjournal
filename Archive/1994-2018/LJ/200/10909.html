Marvell's ARMADA 628 Processor</h2></div></div><p>
Silicon solutions provider Marvell recently rolled out its new ARMADA
628 processor, which the firm bills as the world's first 1.5GHz
tri-core application processor, delivering dual-stream 1080p 3-D video
and graphics for smartphones and tablets. The ARMADA 628 incorporates a
full SoC design with three high-performance, ARM-compliant CPU cores. The
tri-core design, with its two high-performance symmetric multiprocessing
cores and a third core optimized for ultra low power &ldquo;is analogous to
a hybrid muscle car&rdquo;, says Marvell. The ARMADA 628 can perform like
a racecar engine on demand, but it relies on the frugal third core
for routine user tasks and system management. In real-world terms,
this enables the ARMADA 628 to play more than ten hours of full 1080p HD
video or 140 hours of music on a single charge while still providing 3GHz of raw computational horsepower. Marvell also says that the ARMADA
628 is the first mobile CPU to provide high-speed USB 3.0 connectivity.

Adeptol's Text Extraction Software</h2></div></div><p>
Adeptol's new Text Extraction application is designed to extract text
from documents in more than 150 file formats, which then can be processed
by content aggregation tools and used for storing, publishing, archiving
or searching. Adeptol's Java-based software mines text at up to 15,000
words per second and can be deployed on Linux, Solaris or Microsoft
Windows. Some of the more than 150 file formats include Microsoft Office,
OpenOffice.org and PDF. The software's output can be exported to a text
file or text stream, which can be saved into a database or passed on
to other applications. Developers also can leverage Text Extraction to
build text extraction capabilities directly into their applications.

Paragon Software Group's Paragon NTFS and HFS for Linux Combo
Professional</h2></div></div><p>
Knocking down remaining barriers created by incompatible operating
systems is the mission of Paragon Software Group and its upgraded
Paragon NTFS and HFS 8.1 for Linux Combo Professional. Paragon calls the
application suite &ldquo;the industry's highest-performance kernel driver
for NTFS and HFS+ filesystems with advanced read and write operations
for all types of files&rdquo;. Tested on Linux kernels up to 2.6.33, Paragon
NTFS and HFS for Linux demonstrates read and write performance similar to
Linux native Ext3FS with up to 80MB/sec read/write speed. Version 8.1
offers innovations, such as a 40% performance gain on NTFS filesystems,
support for compressed NTFS files, full read/write support for HFS+ and
HFSX, and creation and repair of HFS+ volumes. Paragon also says that
its NTFS driver is more robust than native Microsoft's own. Personal and
commercial editions are available.

Timesys Corporation's Web Factory</h2></div></div><p>
Timesys Corporation is calling on Linux application developers to
test-drive Web Factory, a new and free cloud-based application that
gives platform and application developers an easy-to-use tool for
building Linux applications. The Web Factory application combines the
Linux kernel, toolchain, debugger, the TimeStorm Eclipse-based IDE
and how-to documentation to provide a complete embedded Linux build
system. Everything is included that developers need to test and evaluate
a processor without having to set up host build environments and before
finalizing hardware selection. An easy-to-use wizard guides them through
each step. Developers also do not need to spend time learning each free
BSP/SDK provided by board vendors while testing boards. Key processor
architectures including ARM, MIPS, Nios II, Power Architecture, SuperH
and x86 are supported. Users can upgrade to Timesys's Desktop Factory
subscription anytime if they need live, expert Linux support or advanced
features and in-depth customization on a selected platform.

Dovie On-line Video Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The startup Dovie, Inc., has come into existence to give you one
thing: dovie.tv&mdash;an enterprise-grade on-line video platform with
built-in HTML5-ready players, Flash-free playlist embeds, analytics
and advertising. The SaaS platform, says Dovie, offers a video control
cloud with enough power to launch an on-line TV show, channel or network
from a desktop computer, and it is simple and affordable enough for almost
anyone to use. That power is complemented by the platform's tools that
focus on making on-line video management and monetization accessible
to everyone from mom-and-pop shops, to mid-market entrepreneurs, to
enterprise-level professionals. Dovie also comes plugged in to major ad
networks and ready-to-run CPM-optimized pre-roll video spots. Commercial
content is welcome and doesn't require video producers to relinquish
any rights to use the system.

Recompute Linux PCs</h2></div></div><p>
The new PC maker, Recompute, is now offering Linux-based, OS-free
and Windows-based desktop computers that offer a fresh approach to
sustainability during the entire product life cycle. The company's
approach is based on an intensive study exploring the most sustainable
way to produce, use and dispose of PCs. Surprisingly, Recompute cases
are manufactured of (recyclable and renewable) corrugated cardboard and
treated only with nontoxic glues and flame retardant. To avoid the
waste of electronic components that the user doesn't need, only memory,
power supply and a hard drive come standard, while the eight USB ports
allow the user to accessorize as needed. The design philosophy further
allows for easy dismantling and sustainable local recycling, avoiding
the typical fate of hard-to-handle e-waste from PCs: exporting it to
poor countries where its processing does tremendous damage to people
and the environment. Recompute states that its goal is to change how we
deal with our dead computers and hopes that others will follow their lead.
The effort makes you wonder why more Linux gurus aren't in charge.

David Erik Nelson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snip, Burn, Solder, Shred</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Raising the next generation of creative geeks is serious business, and
since Dr Spock never wrote the definitive guide to geek parenting,
we're on our own. If Spock were alive, he might hand you David Erik
Nelson's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snip, Burn, Solder, Shred: Seriously Geeky Stuff to
Make with Your Kids</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snip</em></span> is a book of geeky, do-it-yourself crafts and
toys that one can make for $10 or less. It includes illustrated, step-by-step
instructions for 24 projects, such as water-powered bottle rockets, an
oversized joy buzzer that (safely) administers a 100-volt jolt, booming
thunderdrums made from salvaged x-ray film, a cigar-box synthesizer, a
powerful muzzleloader that shoots marshmallows, homemade board games and
more. As the readers build, they learn the basics of carpentry, sewing,
circuitry and soldering. No technical experience is required,
and the projects won't break the bank.
