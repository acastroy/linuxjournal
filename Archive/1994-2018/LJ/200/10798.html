The PiTiVi video editor is an intuitive video editor for creating
your next masterpiece.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cde580.0x1dd6358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Video editing on Linux has had a long and complicated history. Although
Linux has long-bathed in image editing, music production and other
creativity-enabling applications, the platform traditionally has struggled
with video production. In the early days, the problem was pinned on the
complexities of supporting different video codecs, but as codec support
continued to improve, the spotlight instead was shone on video editors.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, video editors were largely divided into two camps: hugely
complex, resource-hungry behemoths, such as Cinelerra, or over-simple,
limited offerings such as Kino. Across the world Linux, users craved a
middle ground, desperately hoping for a simple, usability-orientated
editor that supports a wide variety of media formats fused with the
ability to be used on real-world projects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cde580.0x1dd6568"></a>
The PiTiVi Story</h2></div></div><p>
Three years ago at the GNOME developer conference, Edward Hervey, a French
developer living in Barcelona, presented the first cut of his video editor
project, PiTiVi. With it, Edward made a series of firm decisions. First,
it was based on the GStreamer multimedia framework&mdash;arguably the most
popular and recommended way to handle low-level multimedia operations and
content. Second, he focused his project firmly on usability and ease of
use. Edward never set out to produce a super-complex professional editing
tool, but rather a tool focused on simple real-world projects, such as
editing your honeymoon video and putting it on YouTube. Finally, Edward
was willing to delay the development of PiTiVi to &ldquo;do things right&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The latter was particularly apt. It took him three years to get PiTiVi
in a shape where it could be used for the &ldquo;real&rdquo; projects he targeted. Much
of the reason for this was that as Edward hacked on PiTiVi, he would find
bugs and missing features in GStreamer, so he would step away from the
PiTiVi coal-face to fix the GStreamer bug or feature before returning
back to PiTiVi. Although it was a frustrating and time-consuming process, Edward's
work paid off. GStreamer is an incredibly powerful and stable framework
for building applications, so much so that I myself created a music
multitracker project with it called Jokosher. Edward's work not only
generated a better GStreamer, but also a more powerful and mature PiTiVi.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cde580.0x1dd67d0"></a>
Getting PiTiVi</h2></div></div><p>
PiTiVi is available for all major Linux distributions and is now bundled
by default with Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx. You can find packages for
these different distributions in most distribution archives, so use
apt-get, yum or emerge to grab PiTiVi for your system. When you have
installed it, you can click Applications&rarr;Sound &amp; Video&rarr;PiTiVi to
load it. If all else fails, you can download PiTiVi from its Web site
at <a href="http://www.pitivi.org" target="_self">www.pitivi.org</a>.
</p><p>
With PiTiVi ready to roll, you also need to ensure you have the right video
codecs installed for the video formats you want to edit. This is as
simple as ensuring you have the gstreamer-good package installed. If
you want more codecs, but ones that are legally restricted in terms
of redistribution, install the gstreamer-ugly package. Finally,
there is another package with a set of work-in-progress codecs called
gstreamer-bad, which you can try. Personally, I install them all so I
have the widest codec coverage.

The Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Start PiTiVi by clicking Applications&rarr;Sound &amp; Video&rarr;PiTiVi.
First, let's take a look at the PiTiVi (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10798f1.large.jpg"><img src="10798f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Main PiTiVi Interface
</p></div></div><p>
The interface consists of four main areas: the source list, previewer,
timeline and toolbar. 
</p><p>
The source list is the main white area on the left part of the
window. This is where you can import the different video clips, photos
and sound files that will be used in your project. You can either drag
the files onto this white area or click the Import clips... button
to load them. Whichever approach you use, each clip will appear in the
source list area ready for use in your project. Test this by either
dragging a video onto the source list or importing it with the Import
clips... button and selecting a video. If for some reason PiTiVi can't
load your file (most likely due to it being an unsupported format),
an error appears at the bottom of the source list.
</p><p>
The previewer is to the right of the source list and provides a place
to view the video in your project. The black box is where you will see
your video, and the buttons underneath are standard transport buttons to
control playback. The previewer is used not only for playing back your
edited project, but also for previewing clips in the source list. Test
this by dragging the video you imported into the source list and dropping
it on the black box in the previewer. Now, use the transport controls
to play it, and you should see the video play back. Click the different
transport buttons to fiddle with the playback.
</p><p>
The timeline is the long area underneath the source view and
previewer. This area is where you perform the editing on your project. The
concept is simple: the timeline provides a literal timeline of your
project with the far left being the very beginning of your video project
and time increasing to the right. In the timeline, you can drop clips,
cut them into pieces and arrange them in your desired order. The timeline
also can be used to adjust volume, add pictures and overlay music over
different parts. Test the timeline by dragging the video from the
source list and dropping it on the timeline; the clip appears in the
timeline, similar to Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10798f2.large.jpg"><img src="10798f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Video Loaded into the Timeline
</p></div></div><p>
When a clip is loaded, there are two bars: the Video and Audio tracks. If
you see only the second bar, you may need to click the clip in the
timeline and drag it up to the video track to see both. Each bar
represents exactly what it says&mdash;the different video frames and the
audio content. This content is displayed separately, so you can remove
one and not the other if you like. This is common for removing audio
and replacing it with something else, such as a soundtrack.
</p><p>
Before moving on, the timeline has two additional special features:
the ruler and the zoom. The ruler is the gray part with the numbers
at the top of the timeline. If you click any part of the ruler, you can
skip to a different part of the timeline, and that part of the project
is shown in the previewer. When you click on the ruler, you can see the
current position in the video by the red line that is drawn vertically
on the timeline (this is called the playhead). To the left of the ruler
is the zoom. This little slider can be used to adjust the scale of the
timeline. This is useful for zooming out on the project to see it as a
whole or zooming in closely to specific parts of a clip to cut a specific
scene at just the right point.
</p><p>
The final area to look at is the toolbar, which is below the
timeline. This line of buttons provides a simple palette of tools that
you can use to edit content on the timeline. Let's explore some
of these tools now.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cde580.0x1dd7068"></a>
Editing</h2></div></div><p>
All editing in PiTiVi takes place in the timeline. Fortunately, editing
in PiTiVi is incredibly simple, and you really need to know how to
use only one main tool: the cutter.
</p><p>
Video editing is all about cutting video into different pieces and putting
them next to each other to tell a story. To perform a cut in PiTiVi,
place the playhead where you want the cut to happen (by clicking on
the ruler), and click the scissors icon on the toolbar. The clip splits
in half, and you can click on each clip to move it around. Now, if you move your
mouse to the edge of one of the clips, the cursor changes, and you can shorten
and lengthen the clip to taste. To get your cut at just the right place,
you may want to use the ruler to zoom in and out of the timeline and
resize until the clip is just right. If you get tired of constantly
toggling the play button in the previewer to start and stop playback,
use the spacebar as a shortcut for toggling playback.
</p><p>
One of the wonderful aspects of video editing is that it is so simple
to perform, but the impact that is delivered lies in how you organize
the clips, the timing between cuts, how those cuts line up with music
and more. Each of these skills fundamentally boils down to cutting,
trimming, moving and viewing the results in the previewer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cde580.0x1dd7278"></a>
Swapping Out Audio</h2></div></div><p>
While editing, you may want to get rid of some of the audio and replace it
with other audio, such as if you want a series of fast cuts to music. You
do this by splitting the audio from the video in a given clip and deleting
the audio part. By default, your two clips are two different units and when
you drag them, the video and audio are stuck together in each clip. To split
the audio from the video in a given clip, first click on the clip on the
timeline (it will turn a little darker to indicate that you selected it),
and then click the far-right button on the toolbar (the button has an icon
with two blocks and an up-and-down arrow). Clicking this icon unsticks
the video and audio from the selected clip. Now, click the audio clip and
only that will be selected. Delete this by clicking the red circle icon
on the toolbar and only the audio clip will vanish, leaving the video
present. If you now play back the video at that point in the timeline,
you will hear no audio but see the video.
</p><p>
Now, import an audio file into the source list, and drag that to the
timeline where the audio you just deleted was. You now have video over
an entirely different audio track. Play with cutting the video into lots
of different pieces, resizing them and placing them next to each other
over the audio. Before you know it, you will have lots of fast-changing
clips with your new audio soundtrack.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cde580.0x1dd73d8"></a>
Performing Fades</h2></div></div><p>
When you add any clip to the timeline, a horizontal red line is drawn
over the duration of the clip. This is the fade line. With it, you can
control where audio fades (on the audio track) or video fades (on the
video track). An audio fade is where you smoothly adjust the volume of the
clip from one level to another. As an example, at the end of a video you
may want to fade your audio to silence. On the video track, the fade line
lets you control how you fade from video to black. In the same example,
at the end of a project, you could use this line to fade the video to
black slowly.
</p><p>
Using the fade line is simple. Double-click at the point you want a fade
to happen, and a small handle appears on the fade line. Now, click the
handle and move it to adjust the fade. On the volume track, the higher the
red line the louder the volume, and on the video track, the higher the
red line the more video is visible instead of black. Next, click another
part of a fade line and the red line connects the dots. This is how you
do fades: add two points on a line and adjust their settings, and PiTiVi
performs the fade for you. As an example, add a fade handle a little bit
before the end of a video and one right at the end. Move the far-right
handle to the bottom and the far-left one to the top, and the clip will
fade out at the end.
</p><p>
One final note about fades is that they are tied to a clip and not part
of the wider timeline. As such, if you add a fade to a clip and then
move the clip around, the fade moves too. This makes it really simple
to perform fades and then reorganize the clips in your project later.

Rendering Your Project</h2></div></div><p>
When you have finished editing your project, the final step is to
combine all of your edits into a final video that you can share with
others. This process is known as rendering your video. Fortunately,
like everything else in PiTiVi, this is simple.
</p><p>
Click the Render project button and a dialog box appears. Click the
Choose File button and select where you want your rendered file to
be saved. You now can click the Render button, and your video will be
rendered by default as an Ogg Theora video.
</p><p>
If you want to control what kind of video format and size is rendered,
click the Modify button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10798f4.large.jpg"><img src="10798f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. PiTiVi supports a wide variety of output formats.
</p></div></div><p>
In this dialog box, set the visible size of the video in the Video Output
section. There are a variety of defaults here, but you can select
Custom if you want to specify your own size. In the Audio Output
section, you can specify the audio quality of your video. Finally, in
the Export to section, you can choose which codecs are used in your
project. An important note here is that the Container file type can
often contain a different type of codec. As an example, the .avi container
can have many different types of video codecs inside.
</p><p>
When you are happy with the settings, click the OK button to accept
the settings, and then click the Render button in the render project
dialog box to start rendering the video. Rendering can take a while,
so go grab a cup of coffee. Afterward, you will have your fully
edited video ready to view and show others. Congratulations!

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I've explained how to get started with PiTiVi and how its simple
and usability-oriented design and toolset can be used to create a
range of different types of videos. Although simplicity sometimes can be
confused for lack of capability, PiTiVi certainly can meet the needs of
many home videos for sharing with friends and family.
</p><p>
Although PiTiVi is simple and flexible, the project is by no means
standing still. The team already is working on transitions
and titles for videos as we speak. PiTiVi has a rosy future, and so,
therefore, does video on Linux. Be sure to let <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> know what
kind of videos you are making with it. Good luck!
