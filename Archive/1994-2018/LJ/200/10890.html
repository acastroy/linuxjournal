With the arrival of the NVIDIA ION GPU, you can build a media
server that will fit in the palm of your hand.
And, of course, it runs Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2361580.0x24592a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For years I have toyed with the idea of setting up a media server for my
entertainment center. The challenges in my way included cost,
features, aesthetics, background noise and user-friendliness. All
of those things are important because I'm not the only person who will be using
the system I build. Hardware and software technologies are
coming together to address all these challenges. With the advent of
the Intel Atom processor and the NVIDIA ION GPU, affordable hardware 
now is available that allows for an HDTV media server. Likewise, software,
such as XBMC and Boxee, has matured and provides a fun and friendly
user experience for all levels of users.
</p><p>
For $249.99, the HD-ID11 is small, quiet and looks slick. The chassis
is all plastic and feels a bit flimsy when deconstructed. However, the
plastic is fairly thick and has tight tolerances. When the cover is in
place and set screws tightened, it feels solid.
</p><p>
The front of the HD-ID11 has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a 3.5mm microphone
jack, a USB port, an SD card reader, a power button and activity LEDs. The
top of the case has a large blue O that lights up while the machine is
on. It looks nice, but it can be turned off in the BIOS if it is bothersome.
On the side, there is a USB port with a rubber stopper, and on the back,
there are four more USB ports. The back also sports HDMI and DVI
outputs, 10/100/1000 Ethernet, eSATA, optical out and a port for the
power brick.

Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
What makes the ZOTAC ZBOX HD-ID11 special is all the power that's 
packed into the small package. The machine is only 7.4" x 7.4" x 1.73" (188mm x 188mm x 44mm). Here are some of the main technical
specs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
CPU: Intel ATOM D510 (dual-core, 1.66GHz), 667MHz front-side bus.
</p></li><li><p>
Chipset: Intel NM10 Express chipset.
</p></li><li><p>
GPU: NVIDIA ION GPU (with 512MB DDR3 memory).
</p></li><li><p>
Networking: Gigabit (10/1000/10000 Mbps), 802.11b/g/n.
</p></li><li><p>
Audio: onboard 8-channel digital audio, stereo analog audio.
</p></li><li><p>
I/O: HDMI, DVI (DVI-to-VGA dongle included), S/PDIF, mic/headphone, 6
x USB 2.0, RJ45, eSata.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory slot: 1 x 200-pin DDR2-800 SO-DIMM slot.
</p></li><li><p>
Hard drive slot: 1 x 2.5" hard drive (SATA 3.0Gb/s).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One thing separating the ZBOX from the competition is that it does not ship
with memory or a hard drive. This allows you to tailor the computer to
your needs without buying too much hardware or paying an inflated
price for those components.
</p><p>
The HD-ID11 has support for up to 4GB of memory by using a single
200-pin DDR2-800 memory module. I installed 2GB of Kingston DDR2
RAM, which performed flawlessly. If you plan on using the ZBOX for
playback only, 1GB of RAM should be sufficient. With the extra
RAM available, I decided to use a 640GB hard drive and went with local
management for the media. The Intel Atom processor is powerful enough
to do a good job with video playback (via the NVIDIA ION GPU) and
manage the library at the same time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2361580.0x245a3d8"></a>
BIOS</h2></div></div><p>
The ZBOX uses a standard American Megatrends BIOS that can be entered
by pressing the Delete key during the boot phase. The settings I felt
worth changing included the boot priority, turning off the ZBOX logo
at boot time and having the ZBOX restart after a power failure. The
other BIOS settings had sane defaults.
</p><p>
The first thing I noticed when I booted the ZBOX with Ubuntu was it
did not take long before the CPU fan would spin up to maximum and
start to sound like a jet engine. This was worrisome, as I intended to
keep the ZBOX in my living room. Fortunately, there is a BIOS update
available to fix this problem. As with most BIOS updaters, the
updater used by the ZBOX requires a DOS boot disk to run.
See <a href="http://wiki.fdos.org/Installation/BootDiskCreateUSB" target="_self">wiki.fdos.org/Installation/BootDiskCreateUSB</a> for
some easy-to-follow instructions for creating a free DOS USB boot drive.
Once the free DOS image is booted, you can switch to the drive with
your BIOS flasher and follow the updater instructions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2361580.0x245a590"></a>
OS Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing Debian on the box was the only time the Intel Atom
processor felt slow. This step took more than twice as long as I was
expecting. After booting into Ubuntu via the USB memory stick, I
formatted my internal hard drive and ran debbootstrap to install Debian
Squeeze on the hard drive. Once debbootstrap is complete, do not
forget to fix the fstab, networking and install GRUB before
rebooting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2361580.0x245a698"></a>
H.264 Decode Acceleration</h2></div></div><p>
The main reason to opt for a Atom/ION box is for
watching high-definition content. The ION GPU supports full hardware
decode acceleration of all H.264 content (1080i/p) with HDMI out.
With the right software, you can watch both Blu-ray and ripped BD
content.
</p><p>
I installed both XBMC and Boxee on the HD-ID11 to access my content.
Both software packages provide a great user experience and
give you the ability to play virtually any type of content. They
both provide easy-to-use interfaces into your own content and
give you access to content available on the Internet. Boxee is a fork
of XBMC, adding social networking to your home-theater experience.
</p><p>
My greatest struggle with my HD-ID11 was getting the digital 8-channel
audio to work over HDMI. Although instructions are located several
places on the Web (including
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6589810" target="_self">ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6589810</a>), I was not able to
get the audio over HDMI to function properly. This was not a deal-breaker, as the box does support audio out via the 3.5mm headphone
jack.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2361580.0x245a900"></a>
Day-to-Day Use</h2></div></div><p>
I have used the HD-ID11 for about a month to play back my local
content and to stream content from the Web. I must admit, I love the
experience. With few exceptions, the ZBOX has been able to handle any
type of content I've thrown at it from inside XBMC and Boxee.
</p><p>
The only content the ION GPU struggles with is
Flash video. According
to Anadtech.com, the problem stems from the NVIDIA driver requiring
too much data to be copied back and forth between the system memory
and the GPU framebuffer. There is not enough bandwidth over the
single PCIx1 lane to handle this load, which leads to the video
stuttering. Even a 480p window does not play smoothly once full-screened.
The good news is that NVIDIA is working on an updated driver to
fix this problem.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
When I started looking at the ZOTAC ZBOX HD-ID11, I wanted to
build an affordable system to watch my high-definition content&mdash;one that
looked nice, was quiet and user-friendly. With a little work, the
HD-ID11 fits the bill. Its sleek design and quiet fans allow it to
fit into my entertainment center without being noticed. The
combination of the Intel Atom processor with the NVIDIA ION GPU
provide all the power necessary to make for an enjoyable entertainment
experience. Although I would prefer the sound going over HDMI and better
Flash video playback, those are issues that should be addressed via
driver updates in the future. I'm enjoying the media box so much, I am
planning on purchasing a second ZBOX for my bedroom to give me more
access to my content.
