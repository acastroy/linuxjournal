Facebook
</h4><p>
As an inhabitant of the Great Outdoors (Gisborne, New Zealand, aka &ldquo;First
City of the Sun&rdquo;), I most vigorously applaud Doc Searls' insightful debunk
of that facile phenomenon, Facebook [see Doc's &ldquo;Waving Goodbye to
Facebook&rdquo; in the August 2010 issue]. Zuckerberg's only claim to glory, that
I can see, is that he used the Internet to organise the mighty sales
predator and manipulate the great American unwashed into making him a
billionaire at age 26. The idea that this young man and his cohort
should &ldquo;seize control of the Internet&rdquo; is enough to make hair grow in
unspeakable places. Let the kids go to the mall if they wish. Me? I'll make
sail for discovery bay.
</p><p>
It is my pleasure to express the gratitude felt to Mr Searls and his ilk
for their care and compassion in steering true through inevitable
turbulence.

UDEV</h4><p>
I would like to see an article that evaluates which distro has the
easiest UDEV rules to work with. I have spent hours trying to write a rule on
openSUSE and have not gotten the desired results. Is Ubuntu or Fedora easier
to work with?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Robert Finlon  <br><br>
</p><p>
Honestly, UDEV rules are confusing regardless of the distribution. Perhaps
it's something we should cover. Thanks for sharing your misery!&mdash;Ed.

3G Hell or Twitter Client Heaven?</h4><p>
I just read Doc Searls' EOF &ldquo;3G Hell&rdquo; in the October 2010
issue, and I'm shocked&mdash;but, not about the national-fenced data
access. I live in Europe; it's a well-known nightmare and quite a long matter. Let's just say that it's kind of an
indirect battle and not strictly Linux-related.
</p><p>
The shocking bit was to learn that not even <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>'s Senior Editor is
completely in control of what's running on his (Linux-based) phone (that
is, the
Twitter client).
I thought these kind of things affected only ignorant and mortal users like
myself.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>That</em></span> is a kind of battle much more direct and related to the Linux community.
Nobody else has an interest in giving users that kind of control (data
access &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; are worth millions).
Moreover, I think it would be healthy for a community where
real-men-use-vim-and-a-zippo-lighter (aka GUIs-are-for-fussies) start
thinking about simpler ways to give that kind of low-level control&mdash;say, an
IASADCFGS button (as in &ldquo;I'm abroad, shut all data communication for god's
sake&rdquo;).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Daniele Branchini  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> That's a great idea, Daniele. I still think opening up
mobile data markets is a worthy effort. The Internet is a rising tide that
lifts all economic boats. I believe mobile-phone companies can make a lot
more money in the open market than by punishing user mistakes in their
closed ones.

Love sc</h4><p>
As always, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is great. I've read every issue since the
earliest issues, and I can't thank you enough for the articles. I was very
pleased to find an article on sc [see Serge Hallyn's &ldquo;sc: the
Venerable Spreadsheet Calculator&rdquo; in the October 2010 issue]. There
was an article in 1998 that used sc
as an example of free software that is easy to embed software in [see
&ldquo;Perl
Embedding&rdquo; by John Quillan in the November 1998 issue]. I used sc and
Linux to do huge spreadsheet calculations for a Master's degree project. The
other operating systems and spreadsheets kept running out of memory and
resources. I use sc to make and review hundreds of spreadsheets, sometimes
in only a few hours.
Here's a code snippet of mine:


<pre     class="programlisting">

psc -d , &lt;  /.w/Top100Stocks.csv &gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "format A 8 0 0" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "format C 7 0 0" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "format G 12 0 0" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring A1 = \"q\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring B1 = \"Corporation\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring C1 = \"Alpha\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring D1 = \"Last\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring E1 = \"RStr%\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring F1 = \"HVol%\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring G1 = \"AvgVol\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring H1 = \"YTD%\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring I1 = \"52WH\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
echo "leftstring J1 = \"52WL\"" &gt;&gt; /.w/Top100Stocks.sc
...

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this brings me to the main reason I'm typing this up. The article on sc
included some Python code, which is great and very useful. But, psc can be
used to put a .csv into .sc form (as shown above)&mdash;psc comes with sc.
Just do <tt  >man psc</tt> for more information. Again, thanks
for the great article; obviously,
sc is one of my favorite apps. I remember kibbitzing with members of the
local DCLUG, and they very much agreed it was one of their favorites too.

A Tribute to Minimalism</h4><p>
When it comes to Linux, although I've been using it only for about five years 
(I'm 14), I'm already sure of my taste in minimalism when it comes to
computing. I'm a firm believer in minimalism, with Tiny-core Linux as my
primary distribution. I seem to find any other OS wildly bloated. I would be
interested to see more written about it in a world where everything in
computers seems to be getting ever more complicated. There is still
something to be said for keeping it simple.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jed   <br><br>
</p><p>
Indeed, there is something to be said for keeping it simple! For many of us
a command line is all we need. On many days, I manage
my network remotely from my Droid. If you ever meet Kyle Rankin, you'll have to ask
him about fixing his data center from the top of a ski slope. Anyway,
thanks for the reminder to cover the small things. We'll do our
best.&mdash;Ed.

Mutt Convert</h4><p>
I'm writing to say that I very much enjoyed Kyle Rankin's October 2010 Hack
and / column &ldquo;Take Mutt for a Walk&rdquo;. I've looked at using mutt many times in the
past, but I just couldn't overcome the easiness of continuing to use Icedove.
Kyle's article finally gave me the kick in the pants I needed to force
myself to use mutt seriously&mdash;particularly the listing that showed examples
of send hooks and reply hooks, so a huge thank you to him for that!
</p><p>
I would like to point out to Kyle that he is partially incorrect
in stating that mutt requires a local mail server to function. Recent
versions of mutt include basic MTA capabilities, allowing it to speak
directly with a remote mail server (smarthost). This is, in fact, how I am
using mutt currently. To use a remote SMTP server, simply set the smtp_url
variable like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
set smtp_url="smtps://rekkanoryo@rekkanoryo.org:465/"
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, the URL will need to be modified appropriately for different
environments. Hopefully, this information will be useful to my fellow
readers.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
John Bailey  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> Wow, did you hear that Mr Childers? Mutt has direct
SMTP support now. They
must have slipped that in when I wasn't paying attention. Thanks for that
tip; I'm sure other beginning mutt users will appreciate not having to set
up a local mail server just to try it out.

Neat Shell Scripts</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's shell column &ldquo;Function Return Codes and
Daylight Calculations&rdquo; in the October 2010 issue, 
the article compares the current hour and minute with the local sunset
time and uses three tests for this. And, Dave calls it &ldquo;kind of
neat&rdquo; to boot.
</p><p>
That's not very neat. To compare two times, you really should convert to
the lowest unit and do one test. So here, you would do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
currenttime=$(( $hour * 60 + $min ))
sunrisetime=$(( $srh * 60 + $srm ))
sunsettime=$(( $ssh * 60 + $ssm ))
</pre>
</p><p>
And the test is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $currenttime -ge $ sunrisetime -a  $currenttime 
 &#8618;-le $sunsettime ];
then
 # daytime ...
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Isn't that easier to understand and more maintainable?
You even could replace the sunrise and sunset vars with their expressions,
but that would hamper readability.
Remember, people don't want neat. They want readable.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Frederic Mora  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for your note, Fred. One thing I've found
that is true of shell scripts is that you always can write them more succinctly
and tweak algorithms to be shorter or more efficient, but at some point, you
easily can end up spending more time tweaking a script than the time you'd
be saving by it existing in the first place! Oh, and I'll argue the
neat (that is, elegant) versus readable topic, but that's another thing
entirely.

Help a Pain-in-the-Neck Beginner</h4><p>
I am the pain-in-the-neck subscriber who is always asking for more articles
for beginners. If there were three levels of Linux users&mdash;Beginner,
Intermediate and Advanced&mdash;I would characterize myself as between
Beginner and Intermediate but closer to Beginner.
With that in mind, I have a couple requests for articles (information)
in the magazine.
</p><p>
I am a Netflix subscriber (for almost ten years now). However, because I use
the Ubuntu Linux operating system on my computer (v. 10.04), I cannot watch
Netflix on Demand on it. Netflix evidently has no concrete plans to allow
this.
</p><p>
Has anyone figured out a way to watch Netflix movies on his/her Ubuntu
computer? And, if so, would that person be willing to write an article
giving step-by-step instructions suitable for someone like me?
</p><p>
My wife and I do not use cell phones very much; consequently, we have Virgin
Mobile pay-as-you-go plans. Virgin Mobile offers a pay-as-you-go Internet
access, which we would like very much to have. You can buy it on an
as-needed basis, so we would buy it to use when we travel.
</p><p>
Needless to say, because our travel computers are also operated via Ubuntu
Linux, we are locked out of that too. Virgin Mobile folks say that Linux
computer access is coming &ldquo;in the future&rdquo;, but they've been making that
vague promise for more than a year now.
</p><p>
Have any readers figured out a way to operate their Linux computer on this Virgin
Mobile network, and would they be willing to write an article, again with
step-by-step instructions that I could understand?
</p><p>
The step-by-step instructions I request mean just that. They really would have to
be step by step, assuming I know next to nothing (which is really
the case).
I think articles like this (and these two specifically) would be of great
interest to many of your readers, and they certainly would be to me.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Lawrence H. Bulk  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks for the article ideas. Your frustrations are not yours alone.
Although Netflix works on embedded-Linux devices, there seems to be no support
for actual Linux users. Hopefully, we'll see that change someday. As to
your Virgin Mobile problem, I usually keep a copy of Windows XP in a VM
(behind a NAT on my laptop), so I can authenticate to those Windows-only
sites and then use the service on Ubuntu. Good luck!&mdash;Ed.

Reader Feedback</h4><p>
I am regular reader of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and wanted to provide feedback (some a
bit overdue).
I very much enjoyed the article that Rick Rogers wrote in the September
2010
issue on mobile development. I followed up with a
question or two related to iPhone development and he was quite helpful.
Please consider including other articles on mobile development in Linux
when planning future issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> (from Rick).
</p><p>
Also, this is a bit overdue, but I also really enjoyed the Amateur Radio
articles in the January 2010 issue. Because of this special feature, I
purchased two copies off the newsstand and gave the second issue to another
Ham radio operator. Possibly you could carry this theme every 14&ndash;18
months?
</p><p>
Like so many others, I vote with my pocketbook. Because
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> has issues such
as the January issue featuring Amateur Radio, I purchased some of the
special CDs that you offered from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> store (earlier this year).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Kevin   <br><br>
</p><p>
We've gotten lots of good feedback on the Amateur Radio issue, so I
wouldn't be surprised to see the theme come up again in one form or
another. Thanks for the positive words!&mdash;Ed.

Mutt Configuration &ldquo;alternates&rdquo; Line
</h4><p>
I really liked Kyle Rankin's &ldquo;Taking Mutt for a Walk&rdquo; article
(October 2010 issue), and
I tried it out myself (with the configuration printed). However, upon
starting mutt, I got the message &ldquo;Error in /home/ian/.muttrc, line 17:
alternates: unknown variable&rdquo; (though mutt started anyway). A quick Google
told me this was only with Debian and derivatives (I'm running Ubuntu) and
to read /usr/share/doc/mutt/NEWS.Debian.gz. It seems that (in the
repository version anyway), &ldquo;alternates&rdquo; has been changed from a variable
to an option. Changing the line <tt  >set
alternates=((foo|bar)@example.org)</tt> to
<tt  >alternates ((foo|bar)@example.org)</tt> fixes it. Anyway, thanks for a great
article!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ian C.  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span> Thanks for the detective work. I admit that my config
has been in place for
quite some time&mdash;probably from before that option was changed.
