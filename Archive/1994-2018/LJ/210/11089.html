A basic introduction to using the Python boto library to
interact with AWS services and resources.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e1580.0x12d9250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article explores using the boto library to work with resources in the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) cloud. For
those wondering, the boto name refers to a species of freshwater dolphin found in
the Amazon river. boto is maintained by Mitch Garnaat
who works on the Eucalyptus team at Canonical. The library covers many, though
not all, services offered by AWS (see the boto Web site for a current
listing).
</p><p>
But, before I start on the use and care of boto, let me take a little diversion. It probably goes
without saying, but you need to set up an AWS account if you want to play
along. If you already have an Amazon account, you just need to register
with Amazon at the AWS site (see Resources) to set up your AWS account.
Otherwise, you need to set up an Amazon account first. As part of the setup
for your AWS account, you will be issued some credentials (you will be using those
later). Note, if you are a new user to AWS, check out the free tier offer (see
Resources). This allows you to kick the tires at no charge for the most
part. For this article, I try to stick to the offer restrictions as much as
possible.
</p><p>
With the AWS setup out of the way, let's move on to installing boto. At the
time of this writing, the current version is 2.0b4, which is what I use in this
article. boto is available from the Python Package Index (PyPi), and you
can install it with <tt  >easy_install boto</tt>. Remember, if
you want it to be a system-wide
library, do the previous as a superuser. You also can go to either PyPi or the
boto site and download a tarball, and then do a Python setup.py install. The PyPi site
has the latest version only; the boto site has a variety of versions available.
</p><p>
Now that the housekeeping's done, it's time to play. As mentioned above, boto allows
you to access many of the AWS services&mdash;in fact, many more than I have space to
cover here. This article covers the Amazon Machine Image
(AMI), Elastic Block Store (EBS), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage
Service (S3) and Simple Notification Service (SNS). Where an AMI is a virtual
machine, an EBS is a virtual hard drive, EC2 is the cloud you run an AMI/EBS combo
in, S3 is key/object storage and SNS is a messaging system from the cloud. In
all these cases, account information is needed for boto to access AWS.
You'll
need the AWS AccessKey and the AWS Secret Access Key. They were
created when you signed up, but if you did not record them, don't fret. They are
available in your AWS account page as Security Credentials. 
</p><p>
To make things
easier and more secure, there are options to include the information in the
connection string. The first option is to create the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ENV variables and set them equal to the respective keys. The other
option is to create a .boto file in your home directory, and using ini
style, set
the keys (Listing 1). 
</p><p>
Before going further, I should point out that
AWS has a Web-based management tool for most of its services. It is called
the AWS
Management Console, and you can reach it by going to the AWS site and
clicking on the Account tab at the top of the page (I make reference to
and use this tool for some of what is to follow). The management console 
also is handy for confirming that the boto code actually is doing what it is supposed
to be doing. Just remember to click the Refresh button at the top of the Console when in
doubt.

#.boto file format

[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = &lt;some_access_key&gt;
aws_secret_access_key = &lt;some_secret_access_key&gt;

</pre></div><p>
What follows is a basic look at the interaction between boto and AWS. The
code is kept simple both to conserve space and illustrate basic
principles. To get started, I need to create an AMI of my own to work with. The
easiest way to do that is to grab an existing public image and make it private.
I use the Ubuntu images maintained by Canonical for my own use. The best place
to find what is available is the Alestic site (see Resources). It has a handy
table labeled &ldquo;Ubuntu and Debian AMIs for Amazon EC2&rdquo; with tabs for the AWS
regions. Click on the region you want, and then select the appropriate image. For
this article, I selected the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64-bit EBS AMI in the US-East-1
region with an AMI ID of ami-2ec83147 (the ID may be different as new images
are built, see the EBS/S3 AMI Sidebar). Clicking on the arrow next to the image takes me
to the AWS Management Console (after login) to start an instance from the
image. 
</p><p>
To make use of the free tier, I selected the micro instance. At this point,
there is an instance of a public image running on my account. To make a private
image, I could use the management console by right-clicking on the instance and
selecting Create Image, but where is the fun in that? Let's use boto to do it
instead (Listing 2). It's simple. Import the boto convenience function
<tt  >connect_ec2</tt>, and note the lack of access credentials in the connection code. In this
case, they are in a .boto file in my home directory. Then, I use 
<tt  >create_image()</tt> to create and register a private AMI using the running instance
(i-c1315eaf), launched from the management console, with the name lj_test. The
create_image function returns the AMI ID&mdash;in this case, ami-7eb54d17.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e1580.0x12d9a38"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
EBS vs. S3 AMI</b></p><p>
Here's some enlightenment on the differences between an EBS-backed and an
S3-backed AMI. S3 AMIs were the rule when AWS first started. They stored
the image root device as a series of data chunks in the AWS S3 storage
service. S3-backed AMIs also are referred to as instance store AMIs. Later,
EBS-backed AMIs were made available. These store the root device as an
EBS volume. This has some practical considerations, such as the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Maximum root device size
of the S3 is 10GiB and of the EBS is 1TiB.
</p></li><li><p>
The boot time is faster with EBS, because the root device does not have to
be assembled first.
</p></li><li><p>
Stop: EBS AMI instances have the ability to be stopped, which is roughly
equivalent to
a paused state, in addition to being terminated.
S3-backed instances only can be terminated.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For a more-detailed comparison, see the URL listed in the Resources for
this article.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e1580.0x12d9f08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Security</b></p><p>
Security, as always, is an important issue when discussing a server that
is on the Internet. The standard procedures apply to EC2 instances as to
regular servers. For those, see Mick Bauer's Paranoid Penguin column in
previous issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>,
as well as any number of security references. 
</p><p>
However, there is a special case
related to AMIs that deserves mention. As demonstrated in this article,
it is possible to take a publicly available AMI image and make it your own
private image. This presents some special problems; see the 
Security URL in the Resources section. Before you create a production
instance, it would be prudent to read that information and take it
to heart. For the other side of the coin, consult the Alestic blog 
(see Resources) for how to create a secure AMI to share with others that
does not leak out your private information.

    print msg_str
</pre></div><p>
The next step is to put the image to use by launching an instance or instances
of it. For this, see the line in Listing 2 with
<tt  >con.run_instances()</tt>. The
AMI previously created is used as the template for the instances. 
</p><p>
The
<tt  >min_count</tt>
and <tt  >max_count</tt> parameters need some explaining. AWS has a default limit of 20
instances that can be running per region (this can be increased by filling out a
request form) per account. This is where the min/max count comes into play. If I
already had 18 instances running in a region and I set the
<tt  >min_count</tt> at 2 and
the <tt  >max_count</tt> at 5, two new instances will be launched. 
</p><p>
The key name is an SSH
keypair generated by Amazon that is used for SSH access to the instance(s). 
</p><p>
The
<tt  >instance_type</tt> is set to the EC2 micro instance, and it is slotted to run in the
<tt  >us-east-1d</tt> availability zone by the placement parameter. 
Let's take a brief side trip on
AWS availability zones. Availability zones are relative to your account. In
other words, my <tt  >us-east-1d</tt> may not represent the same physical availability zone
as your <tt  >us-east-1d</tt>. 
</p><p>
The final parameter <tt  >disable_api_termination=True</tt> is
a lock-out mechanism. It prevents the termination of an instance using API termination
calls. An instance with this protection in force has to have that parameter
first changed to False and then have a termination command given in order for it
to go away. See the <tt  >modify_instance_attribute()</tt> line for how to undo the
termination protection on a running instance. 
</p><p>
Assuming a successful launch,
<tt  >run_instances()</tt> will return a boto reservation class that represents the
reservation created by AWS. This class then can be used to find the
instances that are running, assuming it was captured and iterated over right
then. A more generic approach is to use the
<tt  >get_all_instances()</tt> function to
return a list of reservation classes that match the criteria given. In
Listing 2, I use the filter parameter to limit my search of instances to those
created from the AMI created above and that are actually running. 
</p><p>
So, where do
you find what filters are available? The boto documentation does not list the
filters, but instead points you at the source, which is the AWS developer
documentation for each resource (see Resources). Drilling down in that
documentation gets you to an API Reference where the options to the various
actions are spelled out. For this particular case, the information is in the EC2
API (see Resources) under Actions/DescribeImages. There is not a complete
one-to-one correspondence between the boto function names and the AWS API names, but it
is close enough to figure out. 
</p><p>
Having run the function, I now have a list of
reservations. Using this list, I iterate through the reservation classes in the
list, which yields an instance list that contains instance classes. This,
in turn, is iterated over, and various instance attributes are pulled out (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11089f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. EC2 Instance Information
</p></div></div><p>
Having created an AMI and launched instances using that image, now what? How
about backing up the information contained in the instance? AWS has a feature
whereby it is possible to create a snapshot of an EBS volume. What is nice about
this is that the snapshots are incremental in nature. Take a snapshot on
day one,
and it represents the state of the volume at that time. Take a snapshot the next
day, and it represents only the differences between the two days. Furthermore,
snapshots, even though they represent an EBS volume, are stored as S3 data. The
plus to this is that although monthly charges for EBS are based on the size of the
volume, space used or not, S3 charges are based on actual space used. So, if you
have an EBS volume of 40GB, you are charged 40GB/month. Assuming only half of
that is used, the snapshot will accrue charges of roughly 20GB/month. The final
feature of a snapshot is that it is possible to create an EBS volume from it
that, in turn, can be used to create a new AMI. This makes it relatively easy to return to
some point in the past. 
</p><p>
To make the snapshot procedure easier, I will create a
tag on the instance that has the EBS volume I want to snapshot, as well as the
volume itself. AWS supports user-defined tags on
many of its resources. The
<tt  >create_tags()</tt> function is a generic one that applies a tag to the requested
resource(s). The first parameter is a list of resource IDs; the second is a
dictionary where the tag name is the key and the tag value is the dictionary
value. Knowing the Name tag for the instance, I use
<tt  >get_all_volumes()</tt> with a
filter to retrieve a volume class. I then use the volume class to create the
snapshot, giving the snapshot a Description equal to the volume Name tag plus the
string <tt  >Snap</tt>. Though the
<tt  >create_snapshot()</tt> will return a snapshot ID fairly
quickly, the snapshot may not finish processing for some time. This is where the
SNS service comes in handy.
</p><p>
SNS is exactly that, a simple way of sending out notifications. The notifications
can go out as e-mail, e-mail in JSON format, HTTP/HTTPS or to the AWS Simple Queue
Service (SQS). I don't cover SQS in depth here; just know it is a more
robust and featured way of sending messages from AWS. 
</p><p>
The first step is to set
up a notification topic. The easiest way is to use the SNS tab in the AWS
management console. A topic is just an identifier for a particular notification.
Once a topic is created, subscriptions can be tied to the topic. The
subscriptions do not take effect until they are confirmed. In the case of
subscriptions going to e-mail (what I use here), a confirmation e-mail is sent
out with a confirmation link. Once the subscription is confirmed, it is
available for use. 
</p><p>
As I alluded to earlier, I demonstrate monitoring the
snapshot creation process with a notification upon completion
(Listing 2). The function <tt  >check_snapshot()</tt> takes a snapshot class returned by
<tt  >create_snapshot</tt> and checks in on its progress at regular intervals. Note
the <tt  >snap.update()</tt>. The AWS API is Web-based and does not maintain a persistent
connection. Unless the snapshot returns a status of
&ldquo;completed&rdquo; immediately, the
while loop will run forever without the <tt  >update()</tt> method to refresh the
status. 
</p><p>
Once the snapshot is completed, a message is constructed using the snap
attributes. The message then is published to the SNS topic, which triggers the
subscription to be run, and an e-mail should show up shortly. The ARN shown stands
for Amazon Resource Name. It is created when the SNS topic is set up and
represents the system address for the topic. Note that the simple part
of SNS is that there is no delivery confirmation. The AWS API will throw an
error if it can't do its part (send the message), but receiving errors are not
covered. That's why one of the sending options for SNS is SQS. SQS will
hold a message and resend a message for either a certain time period or until it
receives confirmation of receipt and a delete request, whichever comes first.
</p><p>
So, there you have it&mdash;a basic introduction to using the Python boto library to
interact with AWS services and resources. Needless to say, this barely
scratches the surface. For more information and to keep current, I
recommend the blog at the Alestic site for general AWS information and
Mitch Garnaat's blog for boto and AWS information.
