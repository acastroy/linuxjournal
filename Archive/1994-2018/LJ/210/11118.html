<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #210, October 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> has decided at last to
release <span   class="bold"><b>Linux version 3.0</b></span>. For a
long time, it seemed as though he might never bump the major version
number, because there was no longer any meaning associated with that
number. And, indeed, his explanation for the change now ran something
along the lines of, Linux is entering its third decade, so why not?
</p><p>
Along with the version bump, Linus has decided to do away with the
whole three-numbered versioning system that the kernel has used since
time immemorial. So from now on, it'll just be 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and so
on.
</p><p>
This is great news for the stable tree maintainers, who were getting
tired of version numbers like 2.6.38.4, which as <span   class="bold"><b>Willy
Tarreau</b></span> said,
look more like IP numbers than version numbers.
</p><p>
But, with the kernel going from a three-numbered system to a two-numbered
system, a lot of support scripts are breaking. It's
Linux's
own Y2K bug. Everyone thought 2.6 was going to be the prefix for the
rest of time and wrote their scripts accordingly. So along with the
version number changes, a lot of fixes are going into the various
support scripts.
</p><p>
As soon as the rumor started floating around, <span   class="bold"><b>Joe
Pranevich</b></span> emerged
from a seven-year absence, to announce the &ldquo;Wonderful World of Linux
3.0&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.kniggit.net/wwol30" target="_self">www.kniggit.net/wwol30</a>. It covers the vast array of
changes that occurred throughout the 2.6 time frame, leading up to
3.0.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Matt Domsch</b></span> announced that <span   class="bold"><b>Dell</b></span> was discontinuing the <span   class="bold"><b>digest forms</b></span> of
the <span   class="bold"><b>linux-kernel</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>linux-scsi</b></span> mailing lists. Although this would affect
a few hundred subscribers, he said that changes at the hardware and
software level of their mail servers meant that certain features
wouldn't be re-implemented, and digests were one of those.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dan Rosenberg</b></span> initiated a fascinating discussion about a particular
security problem: how to deal with attackers who based their attacks
on knowing the location, in RAM, of vulnerable parts of the kernel.
</p><p>
His original idea was to have the system migrate the kernel to a new
randomized memory location during boot. But over the course of
discussion, it turned out there were many hard problems that would have
to be solved in that case.
</p><p>
For one thing, it wasn't always clear where to get enough entropy for
random number generation&mdash;an important issue if one wants to relocate
the kernel to a random place in RAM. Also, the 64-bit kernel would
load into memory in a different way from the 32-bit kernel, and so
it would have to be handled differently by Dan's code. Also, if the
kernel were in a random location, something would have to be done to
oops report generation to make sure the memory references would make
sense to someone reading them. Even more dangerous was the fact that
other parts of the system already would be in memory at the time the
kernel was being relocated, and there was a real danger of clobbering
those parts, which would kill the system. Hibernation also was an
issue, because the existing hibernation code in the kernel made
assumptions about the awakening system that Dan's code violated.
</p><p>
Eventually, it became clear that although Dan's goal was a good one&mdash;making it more difficult to predict where in RAM the vulnerable parts
of the kernel could be found&mdash;there were just too many technical
difficulties to make it feasible in the way he was planning to do it.
</p><p>
Linus Torvalds and <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> each came up with alternative
approaches that might be easier to implement, while still
accomplishing essentially the same goal.
</p><p>
Linus' idea was to relink the kernel binary with a random piece of
data to offset the kernel randomly in RAM that way.
</p><p>
H. Peter's idea was more radical. He wanted to convert the core
kernel code into a set of kernel modules. At that point, the init code
could load the various modules anywhere it wanted, even in
noncontiguous RAM. So, he set out to implement that in the syslinux
bootloader.
</p><p>
Although no clear direction emerged for what would ultimately go into
the kernel, it seems as though a number of good ideas will be pursued.
Almost certainly, the kernel's location in RAM will be randomized in
some way, before too long.

All-in-one Linux-based network servers aren't a new concept. Distributions
like Clark Connect have been around for many years and fit their
niche quite well. Lately, however, there seems to be a new batch of
all-in-one solutions that offer a similar business model.
</p><p>
A couple months ago, we reviewed Untangle, which is a commercial
distribution offering a feature-limited free version. Recently, one of
our readers, Tracy Holz, pointed me to a similar project, ClearOS.
Although Untangle is largely a firewall and network services system,
ClearOS attempts to do more. Using a combination of open-source and
commercial tools, it can be a one-stop server platform for many networks.
</p><p>
ClearOS has a unique modular system that seamlessly includes local
server applications and cloud-based services to end users. You can
purchase
appliance devices or install ClearOS on
an existing server. Much like Untangle, ClearOS's free features are
limited, but it doesn't feel crippled if you stick to just the free stuff.
</p><p>
The features and add-ons are too numerous to list here, but if you're
looking for a commercially backed all-in-one server solution for your
network, check out ClearOS: <a href="http://www.clearfoundation.com" target="_self">www.clearfoundation.com</a>.
Tell 'em Tracy
sent you.

The early years of the 21st century forever will be known as the age of
social media. I don't know if that's something we should be proud of,
but nonetheless, here we are. During the past decade, we've seen things
like Friendster, Pownce, Twitter, Wave, Facebook, Tumblr, Buzz, Gowalla,
Brightkite, Foursquare, Loopt, Plurk, Identi.ca, LinkedIn, Yammer
and now Google Plus.
</p><p>
Google hasn't had a great track record when it comes to social networking,
with both Wave and Buzz being largely unsuccessful. Google Plus, or
G+, seems to be its most appealing offer so far. At the time of this writing,
it's still very early in the beta stages, but it already seems to have
a cleaner and simpler interface than its direct competitor: Facebook.
</p><p>
Google offers unique features like group video chats called
&ldquo;hangouts&rdquo;
and &ldquo;circles&rdquo; of friends to help organize your following/followers.
G+'s integration with other Google services may be the kill shot.
Gmail, Picasa, YouTube and Blogger easily can be integrated directly
by Google, making it simple for those folks already using Google apps
to get their Plus on. Is the third time a charm for Google, or will G+
be another unfortunate carcass in the pile of outdated social media
platforms? Only time will tell.

<h2 class="title">Kickstarter for Open-Source Projects?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #210, October 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The Web site <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" target="_self">www.kickstarter.com</a> is an interesting place. Basically,
it's a site that allows people to invest in various projects, giving
people real money to develop an idea. Those ideas vary from film-making
to programming video games, but the concept is the same regardless of
the project.
</p><p>
What is the motivation for investing in someone's idea? That's the
beauty; it depends on the project. Maybe it's an M.C. Frontalot album
you want to see created, so you give money to the project so the album
is produced. Perhaps it's a video game you'd really like to play,
so you give money to the developer to make the game. Perhaps the developer
gives a copy of the game to all investors. Perhaps not. There are
no rules, just collaboration.
</p><p>
Recently, we've seen open-source projects use Kickstarter, and it seems
like a great idea. If you see a program idea you like, send money, and
if the creators reach their goals, they'll create the programs. Because it's
open source, the benefit is obvious: you get to use the program when
it's complete.
</p><p>
Granted, it's not a perfect system. It certainly would be possible to
abuse it. It seems that actually funding open-source developers is
a good idea though. Perhaps this method of funding is a fad, or maybe
it's the start of something great&mdash;paying developers to develop free
software. If it works, it seems like everyone wins.

A few months ago, I wrote a piece about how you can use MPI to run
a parallel program over a number of machines that are networked
together. But more and more often, your plain-old desktop has 
more than one CPU. How best can you take advantage of the amount of
power at your fingertips? When you run a parallel program on one
single machine, it is called shared-memory parallel programming.
Several options are available when doing shared-memory programming.
The most common are pthreads and openMP. This month, I take a look at openMP
and how you can use it to get the most out of your box.
</p><p>
openMP is a specification, which means you end up actually using an
implementation. It is implemented as an extension to a compiler. So,
in order to use it in your code, you simply need to add a
compiler flag. There is no linking in of external libraries. openMP
directives are added to your program as special comments. This means
if you try to compile your program with a compiler that doesn't
understand openMP, it should compile fine. The openMP directives will
appear just like any other comment, and you will end up with a single-threaded program. Implementations for openMP are available under C/C++
and FORTRAN.
</p><p>
The most basic concept in openMP is that only sections of your code are run
in parallel, and for the most part, these sections all run the same
code. Outside of these sections, your program will run single-threaded. The
most basic parallel section is defined by:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp parallel
</pre>
</p><p>
in C/C++, or:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
!OMP PARALLEL
</pre>
</p><p>
in FORTRAN. This is called a parallel openMP pragma. Almost all of the
other pragmas that you are likely to use are built off this.
</p><p>
The most common pragma you will see is the parallel loop. In C/C++,
this refers to a for loop. In FORTRAN, this is a do loop. (For the rest
of this piece, I stick to C/C++ as examples. There
are equivalent FORTRAN statements you can find in the specification
documentation.) A C/C++ loop can be parallelized with:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i&lt;max; i++) {
   do_something();
   area += i;
   do_something_else();
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The pragma tells the openMP subsystem that you want to create a parallel
section defined by the for loop. What happens is that the defined
number of threads get created, and the work of the loop gets divided
among these threads. So, for example, if you had a quad-core CPU and
had to go through 100 iterations in this for loop, each CPU core
gets 25 iterations of the loop to do. So, this for loop
should take approximately one-fourth the time it normally takes.
</p><p>
Does this work with all for loops? No, not necessarily. In order for the
openMP subsystem to be able to divide up the for loop, it needs to know
how many iterations are involved. This means you can't use any commands
that would change the number of iterations around the for loop,
including things like &ldquo;break&rdquo; or &ldquo;return&rdquo; in C/C++. Both of these drop
you out of the for loop before it finishes all of the iterations. You
can use a &ldquo;continue&rdquo; statement, however. All that does is jump over the
remaining code in this iteration and places you at the beginning of the
next iteration. Because this preserves iteration count, it is safe to use.
</p><p>
By default, all of the variables in your program have a global scope. Thus,
when you enter a parallel section, like the parallel for loop
above, you end up having access to all of the variables that exist in your
program. Although this is very convenient, it is also very, very dangerous. If
you look back at my short example, the work is being done by the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
area += i;
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that the variable area is being read from and written to. What
happens now if you have several threads, all trying to do this at the same
time? It is not very pretty&mdash;think car pile-up on the freeway. Imagine
that the variable area starts with a value of zero. Then, your program
starts the parallel for loop with five threads and they all read in the
initial value of zero. Then, they each add their value of i and save it back
to memory. This means that only one of these five actually will be saved, and
the rest essentially will be lost. So, what can you do? In openMP, there is
the concept of a critical section. A critical section is a section of your
code that's protected so that only one thread can execute it at a time.
To fix this issue, you could place the area incrementing within a
critical section. It would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i&lt;max; i++) {
   do_something();
#pragma omp critical
   area += i;
   do_something_else();
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Remember that in C, a code block is defined by either a single line or a
series of lines wrapped in curly braces. So in the above example, the
critical section applies to the one line <tt  >area += i;</tt>. If you wanted it to
apply to several lines of code, it would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i&lt;max; i++) {
   do_something();
#pragma omp critical
   {
   area += i;
   do_something_else();
   }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This leads us to a more subtle way that multiple threads can abuse global
variables. What if you have a nested for loop and you want to
parallelize the outside loop? Then:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i&lt;max1; i++) {
   for (j=0; j&lt;max2; j++) {
      do_something();
   }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, every thread is going to have access to the global variable
j. They will all be reading from and writing to it at completely random
times, and you will end up with either more than max2 iterations happening
or less than max2. What you actually want to see happen is that each thread
does everything within each iteration of the outside loop. What is the
solution? Luckily, the openMP specification has the concept of a private
variable. A private variable is one where each thread gets its own private
copy to work with. To privatize a variable, you simply need to add to the
parallel for pragma:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma omp parallel for private(j)
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have more than one variable that needs to be privatized, you can add
them to the same <tt  >private()</tt> option, comma-separated. By default, these new
private copies will act just like regular variables in C code on Linux.
This means their initial values will be whatever junk are in those
memory locations. If you want to make sure that each copy starts with the
value of the original value that existed on entering the parallel section,
you can add the option <tt  >firstprivate()</tt>. Again, you enter the variables
you want treated this way in a comma-separated list. As an example
that doesn't really do anything useful, this would look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">

a = 10;
#pragma omp parallel for private(a,j) firstprivate(a)
for (i=0; i&lt;max1; i++) {
   for (j=0; j&lt;max2; j++) {
      a += i;
      do_something(a*j);
   }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
So, you have a program. Now what? The first step is to compile it. Because it
is an extension to the compiler itself, you need to add an option to
your compilation command. For gcc, it would simply be
<tt  >-fopenmp</tt>. You do
need to be careful about the compiler version you are using and what it
supports. The openMP specification is up to version 3.0 right now, with
support varying across the gcc versions. If you want to look at the support
in detail, check the main gcc page at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org" target="_self">gcc.gnu.org</a>. The latest
versions are starting to include support for version 3.0 of openMP. 
</p><p>
Once
you have it compiled, you need to run it. If you simply run it at the
command line, without doing anything else, your program will check your
machine and see how many CPUs you have (a dual-core processor looks like
two
CPUs, in case you were wondering). It then will go ahead and use that
number as the number of threads to use in any parallel sections. If you
want to set the number of threads that should be used explicitly, you can
set it using an environment variable. In bash, you would use this to set
four threads:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
</pre>
</p><p>
You can set more threads than you have CPUs. Because they
are actual threads of execution, Linux has no problem scheduling them on
the available CPUs. Just remember if you have more threads
than available CPUs, you will see a slowdown in the execution speed of
your code, as it will be swapping with itself on the CPUs. 
</p><p>
Why would you
do this? Well, when you are testing a new piece of code, you may
have bugs that don't present themselves until you reach a certain number of
threads. So, in testing scenarios, it may make sense to run with a large
number of threads and a small input data set. The ideal situation is to be
the only process running on the machine and running one thread for each
CPU. This way, you maximize usage and minimize swapping.
</p><p>
All of this has been only the briefest introduction. I haven't covered
generic parallel sections, functional parallelism, loop scheduling or any
of the other more-advanced topics. The specifications are at
<a href="http://www.openmp.org" target="_self">www.openmp.org</a> along with links to tons of tutorials and other
examples. Hopefully, this introduction has given you some ideas to try and
provides a small taste of what may be possible. I will leave you with one
last hint. If you want to start to play with parallel programs without
having to think about it, add the option
<tt  >-ftree-parallelize-loops</tt>. This
will try to analyze your code and see if it can parallelize any sections.
It won't be able to catch all of the sections that can be parallelized,
because it can't understand the context of your code and what it is trying to
do. But, for the time it takes to add the option and recompile and test the
timing, it definitely would be worthwhile.

$ watch -n 1 xdotool search --name bzimmerly@zt key ctrl+m
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >watch</tt> command will (every second) issue a
&ldquo;Return&rdquo; (Ctrl-m)
keystroke to the window that has &ldquo;bzimmerly@zt&rdquo; as a title,
and it will
stop only when you interrupt it with Ctrl-c! I think this is neato
daddyo! (What can I say? I'm a child of the '60s!)
