luakit&mdash;Extensible Micro Browser
(<a href="http://luakit.org/projects/luakit" target="_self">luakit.org/projects/luakit</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Fellow control freaks, if you enjoy having dominion over just about
every aspect of a program, I think you'll like this. Inspired by
projects such as uzbl, and developed by fellow Perth-boy Mason Larobina,
luakit is the Web browser for those who like the element of control.
According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
luakit is a highly configurable, micro-browser framework based on
the WebKit Web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit. It is very fast,
extensible by Lua and licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license.
</p><p>
It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people with
too much time on their hands who want to have fine-grained control over
their Web browser's behavior and interface.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11128f1.large.jpg"><img src="11128f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
It's hard to notice the discreet tabs, with black for active and gray for
inactive, but they're very cool.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11128f2.large.jpg"><img src="11128f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
This lightweight browser seems to run YouTube with Flash just as well 
as Firefox and Chrome.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11128f3.large.jpg"><img src="11128f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Project code that's both documented and diagrammed&mdash;now I've seen 
everything!
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Pre-made packages/binaries are available on the Web site for Gentoo,
Arch Linux, Debian/Ubuntu and Fedora, along with the source code.
</p><p>
As for library requirements, the documentation says you need the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
gtk2.
</p></li><li><p>
Lua (5.1).
</p></li><li><p>
lfs (lua filesystem).
</p></li><li><p>
libwebkit (webkit-gtk).
</p></li><li><p>
libunique.
</p></li><li><p>
sqlite3.
</p></li><li><p>
help2man.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
On my Kubuntu system, the lfs package was called liblua5.1-filesystem0. If
you're using the source and running into dependency errors, it's worth
trying out the above libraries' development packages (usually named -dev)
and doing the luakit installation again.
</p><p>
If you're running with the source, grab the latest tarball from the
Web site, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder. Enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm not sure what resources Mason has used here, but this make script
is kind of like a cross between ./configure and make, combining the
two&mdash;interesting. If you run into any errors here, chances are that
you're missing a library dependency somewhere; pay close attention to
the output.
</p><p>
Finally, to install luakit, if your distro uses sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The actual interface is rather unique. Like the lovechild of Chrome
and Vim, the interface is part sleek and modern-minimalist, part
old-school hacker. Entering a URL or even clicking Back may leave
the uninitiated a little shocked, as the GUI elements one takes for
granted are seemingly nonexistent. However, the two main UI elements
unlock them immediately: right-clicking and the input bar.
</p><p>
Starting with the input bar, you can enter URLs with o, t or w to open
URLs in the same tab, a new tab or a new window, respectively. Right-clicking
provides controls like Back, Forward, Stop and so on.
</p><p>
On the subject of tabs, not only was I impressed by their presence in
this lightweight browser, but they're also by far the coolest tabs I
ever have seen. They nearly blend into the background
(perhaps part of their mystique), and at first I didn't even notice their
presence. Open some new tabs with t, and the tabs at the top of the
browser start dividing evenly, with the active tab a strong black,
and the inactive tabs techy-gray.
</p><p>
Much to my surprise (given luakit's minimalist nature) Flash appeared
to work without any worries, with YouTube as my first test. Indeed,
many pages I thought wouldn't stand a chance, loaded in a way that was
both accurate and stable.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, the actual browsing aspect is only half the equation
when considering luakit, whose real appeal lies in its endless
customizability. The entire browser is constructed by a series of config
files, which do all kinds of things, like change what parts of the browser
are loaded and in which order, define button combinations and so on.
</p><p>
Regarding this, Mason gave a great response to one of my leading questions
that was long and detailed, and it will appeal to anyone who knows what
they're doing. Check the Web site if you want to see it.
</p><p>
For the modder who is about jump into coding, luakit's Web site has
something I've never actually come across. Unlike 99% of us who just
start coding randomly, the Web site has a whole Data Structure Index,
explaining each file with flowcharts and documented references&mdash;the
way we were taught but always avoided!
</p><p>
If any programmers are looking to help out with luakit, Mason recommends
porting a Firefox or Chrome plugin that you can't live without. A simple
method for ad-blocking also would be greatly appreciated.
</p><p>
At the end of the day, this is one of those projects that will inspire
great loyalty among its fans with its own unique style. And if any
film-makers working on a hacker movie are reading this and looking for
a browser that looks Neo-from-<span   class="emphasis"><em>The-Matrix</em></span> cool, this is the one.

sinfo&mdash;Advanced Network Monitoring
(<a href="http://www.ant.uni-bremen.de/whomes/rinas/sinfo" target="_self">www.ant.uni-bremen.de/whomes/rinas/sinfo</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Are you looking to set up some kind of network cluster, but dealing with
many different computers, all of which are nearly impossible to keep track
of? What if you're in charge of a room full of computers and also of those who are
using them (some of whom may be looking to slack off or run something I'll
politely dub &ldquo;objectionable&rdquo;)? sinfo may be what you're looking for.
According to its Freshmeat entry:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
sinfo is a monitoring tool that uses a broadcast scheme to distribute
information on the status of each computer on your local network. It
supports CPU, memory usage, network load and information about the
top five processes on each computer. sinfo uses ncurses to display the
information in an attractive manner.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11128f4.large.jpg"><img src="11128f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
sinfo displays invaluable system information over multiple PCs for easy
administration.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11128f5.large.jpg"><img src="11128f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Further extending sinfo's use with the -s switch provides even meatier
information.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
A binary is available for those with Debian-based systems, such as
Debian, Ubuntu and the like, and chances are that it's already sitting
in your repository. Given that this software also includes a startup
d&aelig;mon, sinfod, I thoroughly recommend taking the binary option if you
can, because a great deal of the process is automated (it's also the version
I cover here). Nevertheless, in the interests of distro
neutrality, I also cover the source version during the installation, 
as usual.
</p><p>
As far as library requirements are concerned, you need the following,
according to the documentation:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ncurses: libraries for terminal handling (tested with version 5.7).
</p></li><li><p>
boost: peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries using Boost.Bind and
Boost.Signals (tested with version 1.42).
</p></li><li><p>
asio (&gt;=1.1.0): asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network
programming (tested with version 1.4.1).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you're compiling from source, you need the pesky developer packages
as well (-dev). The number of packages under libboost- in particular
are quite extensive, so if you run into any problems during
<tt  >make</tt>, the
libboost libraries may be the culprit, requiring more of its packages
before you can install properly.
</p><p>
For those running with source, once you have the library requirements
out of the way, grab the latest tarball and extract it. Open a terminal
in the new folder and enter the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Before I continue, I should explain that sinfo
is broken into two parts: the everyday application and the background
d&aelig;mon. As for installing the d&aelig;mon, I'm going to leave this part to you,
because it seems that just about every distro has a different method of
dealing with startup processes (and the Debian package takes care of all
that). Check the readme files in the source tarball and the Web site for
more information if you're still using the source.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
sinfo is a &ldquo;semi-GUI&rdquo; command-line program that's actually pretty easy to
use, although advanced users can make it do some pretty cool stuff via
command-line switches. To run the program in its basic mode, simply enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sinfo
</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming that you have sinfo installed only on your machine for now,
the information being displayed will be just that of your machine. From
this screen, you see all kinds of useful information, such as available memory,
CPU utilization, hostnames and so on. The sinfo Keyboard Commands sidebar
shows a list of the keyboard commands that drive sinfo, toggling
parts of the program with a single keystroke.
</p><p>
However, in this state, it's really just a glorified version of
<tt  >top</tt>.
The whole point is that you can display information from several machines at
once to keep tabs on a LAN. If the other PCs on your network have sinfo
in their distro's repository, it should be as easy as installing
sinfo via apt-get and the like, then running the program on those
machines. As soon as I did that on a second machine,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>,
both PCs were displaying under both installations. Keep installing it
on other networked PCs, and the list will grow larger and larger.
</p><p>
Those are the basics out of the way, but what about the extended
features? Obviously, I don't have the space to cover everything here
(and you really should check the man page for more details), but let's look
at some of my favorite features.
</p><p>
At the command line, if you add the <tt  >-W</tt> switch (or
alternatively <tt  >--wwwmode</tt>)
like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sinfo -W
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fb3580.0x24a64c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the output changes from the usual <tt  >top</tt>-like screen to HTML
output instead&mdash;very handy for those into things like remote
administration
with automated Web pages and whatnot.
</p><p>
This is slightly redundant while in the sinfo user interface (simply press
the s key), but it's awesome when doing some kind of command-line scripting:
add the switch <tt  >-s</tt> (or alternatively
<tt  >--systeminfo</tt>), and a big chunk of
serious system information is output as well. As an example, my two
machines had the following extra information:


<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.2   knightro-bigdesktop i686 
 &#8618;Linux 2.6.32-27-generic #49-Ubuntu SMP Wed De
cpus: 4  MHz:  800.0
RAM: 3276.5 MByte   swap: 7629.4 Mbyte
load 1min:  0.0   load 5min:  0.1   load 15min:  0.1

192.168.1.1   nhoj-desktop x86_64 
 &#8618;Linux 2.6.38-8-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11 0
cpus: 2  MHz: 1000.0
RAM: 2007.6 MByte   swap: 2047.3 Mbyte
load 1min:  0.1   load 5min:  0.2   load 15min:  0.1
uptime     0 days, 19:13:03
</pre>
</p><p>
This kind of information suggests many potential uses, and keeping watch
and troubleshooting at LAN parties springs instantly to mind. If any one
node is having trouble, there's a good chance that the host will be able
to hit the ground running when trying to isolate the problem.
</p><p>
In the end, sinfo is not only well designed, but if it's installed as
binary, it's also convenient. Ultimately, I think this application will
carve out an instant niche for itself, and hopefully, it will turn into one
of those standard applications that are so commonplace, they just
become part of the landscape. Maybe porting it would do exactly that.
