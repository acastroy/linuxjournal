Looking for a JavaScript templating system? Mustache.js might be
right for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1399580.0x1491300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past few articles, I've looked at a number of uses for
JavaScript, on both the server and the client. I hope to continue my
exploration of such systems, particularly on the client side, in the
coming months.
</p><p>
But for now, I want to tackle a more mundane problem that JavaScript
programmers encounter all the time: the fact that JavaScript
doesn't have any native string-interpolation mechanism. Sure, you 
always can use the + operator to concatenate strings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"hello, " + "world"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1399580.0x1491568"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which gives you the string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"hello, world"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1399580.0x14916c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which is what you might expect. But, what if you have a variable
<tt  >"username"</tt>, and you want to say
<tt  >"hello"</tt> to the user in a friendly way?
In Ruby, you would use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"hello, #{username}"
</pre>
</p><p>
And in Python, you would write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"hello, %s" % username
</pre>
</p><p>
But in JavaScript, you're basically stuck typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"hello, " + username
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1399580.0x1491a38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which isn't so terrible if you have one variable at the end of the
string. But the more I'm working with JavaScript, the more I'd like
to have more sophisticated string interpolation.
</p><p>
While I'm wishing, I'd like to have all sorts of text-formatting and
templating capabilities that I'm used to from other languages or from
various Web frameworks.
</p><p>
Now, this doesn't sound like a tall order. And heaven knows, I've
used a lot of templating systems during the years, so I know that it's
not very hard to create one&mdash;especially if the standards aren't
very high. But as Web applications become more heavily focused on the
browser, and on JavaScript, you'll need a templating solution that
allows you to work easily in that environment.
</p><p>
Fortunately, several templating systems exist. One of the most
prominent and interesting is Mustache.js, a JavaScript implementation
of the Mustache templating system that is available for many different
languages. In contrast with most other templates I've used,
Mustache.js is not a fully fledged programming language, as you might
expect. Rather, it's a tightly defined domain-specific language that
describes the page, but that doesn't have the potential to make
templates into another code repository.
</p><p>
So, this article explores Mustache.js&mdash;how to install and use it,
as well as when it's appropriate and how to use a few of the more-advanced features that come with it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1399580.0x1491cf8"></a>
Templates</h2></div></div><p>
Many readers probably are familiar with a typical sort of template,
with a style used by PHP, ASP, JSP and Ruby's ERb. Anything that
should be executed goes in braces that look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% varname = 5 %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
And, anything you want to display on the screen gets nearly the
same sort of tag, but with an = sign on the left:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;%= varname %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The good news with such templates is that they're rather easy to use.
You don't have to worry about which symbols mean what,
or set up a file just to see some interpolated variables. But on the other
hand, they're too simple for producing large-scale reports and certainly
for doing serious text manipulation.
</p><p>
The other problem is that as soon as you put code into your template,
you're violating the rule of MVC, which is that you don't want to put
very much executable code in your template. Assigning variables isn't
a good idea, but calling methods, not to mention retrieving rows from
the database, is something you normally don't want to be doing
within your views. But, you can be even stricter in how you interpret
this no-execution policy. What if you could avoid all executable code,
including if/then statements, loops and other things to which you're
accustomed?
</p><p>
Mustache adopts this philosophy in that it allows for a limited set
of things to take place within the template. You could argue (and I'd
probably believe you) that it's going too far to say, as the Mustache
slogan says, that they're &ldquo;logic-less templates&rdquo;. Indeed, Mustache
templates do have a fair amount of logic in them. But the nature of
the templating language ensures that the special functions cannot be
abused too terribly. If you want to execute code, you'll have to do
it outside the realm of Mustache.
</p><p>
(If you're wondering, it's called Mustache because it uses double-curly
braces, {{ and }}, as delimiters. Double-curly braces
indicate where you want interpolation to take place, and they also delimit
various control structures.)
</p><p>
Installing Mustache.js couldn't be easier. Download the
single mustache.js file from GitHub, put it in an appropriate
directory inside the JavaScript directory for your Web application&mdash;or
alongside your HTML file, if you're just experimenting with it outside a
framework&mdash;and you're ready to go.
</p><p>
Note that the inclusion of Mustache.js doesn't turn your HTML file (or
your JavaScript file, for that matter) into a Mustache template.
Rather, it provides you with a number of functions that can be applied
to text strings. You then can do whatever you want with those text
strings, from inserting them into a file to using them for further
processing.
</p><p>
Listing 1 contains a simple example of using Mustache.js. At the top
of the &lt;head&gt; section, I include both the jQuery library and
Mustache.js, as I often would in an HTML file. I then have a bit
of JavaScript code executing in the standard
<tt  >$(document).ready</tt>
function call, ensuring that it will be executed only after jQuery has
detected that the entire HTML document has loaded. This avoids a race
condition, in which the JavaScript might or might not run before the
HTML has been rendered.

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="mustache.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     $(document).ready(
     function () {
     var template_vars = {
     name: 'Reuven',
     number_of_children: 3
     }

     var template = "&lt;b&gt;{{name}}&lt;/b&gt; has 
     &#8618;{{number_of_children}} children.";
     var html = Mustache.to_html(template, template_vars);
     $('#target').html(html);
     });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Testing testing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="target"&gt;This space for rent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><p>
I then define a variable (template_vars), a JavaScript object with two
properties, &ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;number_of_children&rdquo;. These properties can be
of any data type, including a function. If a property is a function,
it is evaluated when interpolated, and the result of the
function's evaluation is inserted into the template.
</p><p>
I've then broken up the interpolation into three distinct parts.
First, I define the text (the &ldquo;template&rdquo; variable) into which I want
to interpolate variables. Notice how the string is a tiny template,
and that anything within {{ }} (double-curly braces) is evaluated as a
variable by Mustache.js.
</p><p>
Next, you apply your template_vars to the template, getting some HTML
back. You then can do whatever you want with that HTML, including (most
easily) replacing the text from an existing HTML tag. You also
could have created a new node, replaced an existing one or modified the
text even further.
</p><p>
In the end, I did something fairly simple, namely using jQuery's
&ldquo;html&rdquo; function to replace the existing HTML with the improved
version.
</p><p>
For something a bit more complex, which resembles traditional HTML
templates a bit more, consider Listing 2. In this example, I decided
to do a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mad Libs</em></span> sort of replacement, but instead of changing text
in a string, I changed it in the document itself. Using jQuery's
selectors, I chose all elements with a &ldquo;template&rdquo; class. (This allows
the author of the page to decide whether the {{ }} tags will be used on a
particular tag.)

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="mustache.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     $(document).ready(
     function () {
     var template_vars = {
     proper_noun: 'Reuven',
     color: 'green',
     food: 'ice cream'
     }

     $(".template").each(function(index, value) {
     var current_html = $(this).html();
     var translated = Mustache.to_html(current_html, template_vars);
     $(this).html(translated);
     });

     });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Testing testing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="template"&gt;My name is {{proper_noun}}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="template"&gt;I like to wear {{color}} shirts, 
and eat {{food}} for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><p>
Perhaps the most interesting and important part of this code is the
callback function I used to do the translation. Rather than using
a typical jQuery loop, which would have turned into a rat's nest of
code, I decided to use the &ldquo;each&rdquo; function, which iterates over a
collection. In each iteration, $(this) refers to the item, and you
next use the Mustache.to_html function to translate it, and then
replace the text with its transformed self. In this way, your
JavaScript easily can affect the text on the page.
</p><p>
What happens if you ask Mustache to use a variable value that you have
not defined? It continues silently, using an empty string. This
means that if your template_vars variable contains one or more keys
with misspelled names, you won't get any warnings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1399580.0x1492c18"></a>
Loops and Conditionals</h2></div></div><p>
Remember when I wrote that I wouldn't call Mustache.js &ldquo;logic-less
templates&rdquo;, because the templating language still includes
conditionals? Well, now you can see what I meant. (I should add that
I'm fairly convinced I normally don't want code to be
evaluated/executed in the template. But, conditionals and loops are
two things that every useful templating system I've had has
incorporated, and they are a necessary piece of logic for templates to be
useful.)
</p><p>
If you look at Listing 3, you'll see how to create loops. I have
added an array (&ldquo;children&rdquo;) inside my template_vars variable. But
instead of saying <tt  >{{children}}</tt> to retrieve the contents of the array,
you instead say <tt  >{{#children}</tt> at the beginning of the loop and
<tt  >{{/children}</tt> at its end. Mustache.js is smart enough to know what to
do, and it repeats the block within these delimiters, once for each
element of the array. To get the current array element itself, you
use the special syntax {{.}}.

Listing 3. Loops</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Testing&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="mustache.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     $(document).ready(
     function () {
     var template_vars = {
     name: 'Reuven',
     children: ['Atara', 'Shikma', 'Amotz']
     }

     var template = "&lt;b&gt;{{name}}&lt;/b&gt; has children
     &#8618;named:&lt;ul&gt;{{#children}}&lt;li&gt;{{.}}&lt;/li&gt;{{/children}}.&lt;/ul&gt;";
     var html = Mustache.to_html(template, template_vars);
     $('#target').html(html);
     });
&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Testing testing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="target"&gt;This space for rent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></div><p>
That's certainly some degree of logic, but it's nothing compared
with the <tt  >{{#mycondition}}</tt> tag, which begins the equivalent of an
if-then statement. But wait, what are you checking? Well, if you're
starting your condition with <tt  >{{#mycondition}}</tt>, that
means you're
going to treat &ldquo;mycondition&rdquo; as a function, evaluating it at runtime
and then displaying only the contents of the block (that is, the stuff
between <tt  >{{#mycondition}}</tt> and
<tt  >{{/#mycondition}}</tt> if the function returns
&ldquo;true&rdquo;).
</p><p>
Mustache has a bunch of other features too. It automatically escapes
HTML by default, but it has a mechanism, {{{ }}}, that uses raw HTML,
without cleaning up the &lt; and &gt; symbols that can be both annoying and
potentially dangerous. So, you have the flexibility to replace text
as appropriate in your application.
</p><p>
The examples I have provided obviously are somewhat contrived and
simple. Fortunately, the syntax of Mustache.js is simple enough that
it shouldn't take very long at all to incorporate it into your work.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Mustache is a straightforward, but powerful, templating system for
JavaScript. If you're starting to put together a Web application that
needs to rewrite parts of the text based on AJAX calls or JavaScript
output, or if you're writing a one-page JavaScript-based application,
you certainly should look into Mustache.js. The home page on
GitHub has good documentation, and other tutorials and documents are
linked from there as well.
