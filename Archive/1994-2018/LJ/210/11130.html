I first started my sysadmin career about the time in history when 10BASE2
was beginning to see widespread adoption. ThinNet, as it also was called, meant
an affordable transition from the SneakerNet so many businesses used.
(SneakerNet is a term for walking floppy disks back and forth between
computers&mdash;not really a network, but it's how data was moved.) Anyone who
remembers those years knows ThinNet was extremely vulnerable to system-wide
failures. A single disconnect (or stolen BNC terminator cap at the end of
the chain) meant the entire network was down. That was a small price to
pay for such inexpensive and blazing-fast speed. 10Mbit was the max speed
ThinNet supported, but who in the world ever would need that much
throughput?
</p><p>
Networking has changed a lot since my career started, and it's issues like
this one that keep me up to date. Kyle Rankin starts off with a hacking
primer using an off-the-shelf home router. This isn't merely the old WRT54G
hacks you're used to reading about. Instead, Kyle shows us how to don our
black hats and really hack in to a D-Link wireless 802.11n router. If Kyle's
hacking tutorial makes you a little nervous, don't worry; we have some
network security this month as well. Henry Van Styn teaches us some
advanced firewall configurations with ipset. Granted, firewalls won't
protect anyone from PHP vulnerabilities, but they still help me sleep better
at night.
</p><p>
Mike Diehl switches gears, and instead of showing how to hack (or
protect) the network, he describes how to create. Specifically, he explains
how to create network programs that are cross-platform and easy to build
with ENet. As someone whose programming skills peaked with <tt  >10
GOTO 10</tt>,
Mike's idea of &ldquo;easy&rdquo; might be relative, but he gives coding examples, so
even copy/paste programmers can join in.
</p><p>
Henry Van Styn has another article in this issue on how to use tcpdump to
troubleshoot network issues effectively. If you're in charge of a large
network, you owe it to yourself to polish your tcpdump skills. It's a tool
every network administrator needs, and Henry takes some of the mystery out
of it. Adrian Hannah follows in a one-two punch teaching us how to
sniff packets effectively. Packet sniffing is one of those skills that can
be used for good and evil both, but we'll assume you'll use your powers for
good. At the very least, you'll understand what sort of information is
available on your network so you can try to secure it a bit.
</p><p>
Networking also has made so many other facets of computing possible. If it
weren't for networking, we wouldn't have cloud computing. Adrian Klaver
shows how to use Python to work with Amazon Web Services. For some of
you, cloud computing is scary, because you never get to access the computer
you're working on directly. One way to help alleviate the concern of
working on computers far away is to implement remote viewing. Joey Bernard
covers several methods for accessing a computer remotely, whether it's in the
next room or on the next continent. Granted, that doesn't work for cloud-based
services, but it does for remotely hosted servers, so it's an article
you'll want to check out.
</p><p>
Our networks are even home to filesystems nowadays, and Petros Koutoupis
shows how to deploy the Lustre distributed filesystem. Utilizing
multiple nodes for file storage is a great way to leverage your network
resources for speed and redundancy. Regardless of your network speed,
however, data will travel only as quickly as the hard drive underneath will
send it. Kyle Rankin reviews the Intel 320 series SSD this month. If you
haven't taken the plunge to SSD, after reading about his results, you might
decide that
now is the time.
</p><p>
And, of course, for those of you who think networking is good only for
accessing your e-mail, we have articles for you this month too.
Programmers will like Reuven M. Lerner's article about his mustache&mdash;more
specifically, Mustache.js, a JavaScript templating system that might be
right up your alley. Dave Taylor shows us scripters how to manipulate image
files without ever leaving the command line. There's nothing wrong with
firing up The GIMP to edit a graphic file, but sometimes you just want to
scale an image quickly. Dave explains how.
</p><p>
We've also got new product debuts, Linux news and
interesting things I've stumbled across this month in the UpFront section.
So whether you're carrying this issue around on a Flash drive (SneakerNet
anyone?) or downloading it wirelessly from the wireless router you
just hacked, we hope you enjoy it. We certainly enjoyed making it.
