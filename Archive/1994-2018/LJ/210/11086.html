Your data isn't safe on public networks. You may not even realize
the extent to which that statement is true.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd4580.0xecc1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Imagine this: you're sitting in your local coffee shop sucking down
your morning caffeine fix before heading into the office. You catch
up on your work e-mail, you check Facebook and you upload that financial
report to your company's FTP server. Overall, it's been a
constructive morning. By the time you get to work, there's a
whirlwind of chaos throughout the office. That incredibly sensitive
financial report you uploaded was somehow leaked to the public,
and your boss is outraged by the crass and unprofessional e-mail you
just sent him. Was there some hacker lurking in the shadows that
broke into your company's network and decided to lay the blame on you?
More than likely not. This mischievous ne'er-do-well probably
was sitting in the coffee shop you stopped at and seized the opportunity.
</p><p>
Without some form of countermeasures, your data isn't safe on public
networks. This example is a worst-case scenario on the far end of the
spectrum, but it isn't so far-fetched. There are people out there who
are capable of stealing your data. The best defense is to know what
you can lose, how it can get lost and how to defend against it.

What Is Packet Sniffing?</h2></div></div><p>
Packet sniffing, or packet analysis, is the process of capturing any
data passed over the local network and looking for any information
that may be useful. Most of the time, we system administrators use
packet sniffing to troubleshoot network problems (like finding out why
traffic is so slow in one part of the network) or to detect intrusions
or compromised workstations (like a workstation that is 
connected to a remote machine on port 6667 continuously when you don't use IRC
clients), and that is what this type of analysis originally
was designed for. But, that didn't stop people from finding more creative
ways to use these tools. The focus quickly moved away from its
original intent&mdash;so much so that packet sniffers are considered security
tools instead of network tools now.

Web Site
</p></div></div><p>
Finding out what someone on your network is doing on the Internet is
not some arcane and mystifying talent anymore. Tools like Wireshark,
Ettercap or NetworkMiner give anybody the ability to sniff network
traffic with a little practice or training. These tools have become
increasingly easy to use and continue to make things easier to
comprehend, which makes them more usable by a broader user base.

How Does It Work?</h2></div></div><p>
Now, you know that these tools are out there, but how exactly do they
work? First, packet sniffing is a passive technique. No one
actually is attacking your computer and delving through all those
files that you don't want anyone to access.
It's a lot like eavesdropping. My computer is just listening in on the
conversation that your computer is having with the gateway.
</p><p>
Typically, when people think of network traffic, they think that it goes
directly from their computers to the router or switch and up to the
gateway and then out to the Internet, where it routes similarly until
it gets to the specified destination. This is mostly true except for
one fundamental detail. Your computer isn't directly sending the data
anywhere. It broadcasts the data in packets that have the destination
in the header. Every node on your network (or switch) receives the
packet, determines whether it is the intended recipient and then
either accepts the packet or ignores it.
</p><p>
For example, let's say you're loading the Web page
http://example.com on your computer &ldquo;PC&rdquo;. Your computer sends the request
by basically shouting &ldquo;Hey! Somebody get me
http://example.com!&rdquo;,
which most nodes simply will ignore. Your switch will pass it on 
to where it eventually will be received by example.com, which will pass
back its index page to the router, which then shouts &ldquo;Hey! I have
http://example.com for PC!&rdquo;, which again will be ignored by everyone
except you. If others were on your switch with a packet sniffer, they'd
receive all that traffic and be able to look at it.
</p><p>
Picture it like having a conversation in a bar. You can have a
conversation with someone about anything, but other people are around
who potentially can eavesdrop on that conversation, and although you
thought the conversation was private, eavesdroppers can make use of
that information in any way they see fit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd4580.0xeccc48"></a>
What Kind of Information Can Be Gathered?</h2></div></div><p>
Most of the Internet runs in plain text, which means that most of the
information you look at is viewable by someone with a packet
sniffer. This information ranges from the benign to the sensitive.
You should take note that all of this data is vulnerable only through
an unencrypted connection, so if the site you are using has some form
of encryption like SSL, your data is less vulnerable.
</p><p>
The most devastating data, and the stuff most people are concerned
with, is user credentials. Your user name and password for any given
site are passed in the clear for anyone to gather. This can be
especially crippling if you use the same password for all your
accounts on-line. It doesn't matter how secure your bank Web site
is if you use the same password for that account and for your
Twitter account. Further, if you type your credit-card information into an
unsecure Web page, it is just as vulnerable, although there aren't many
(if any) sites that continue this practice for that exact reason.
</p><p>
There is a technique in the security world called session hijacking
where an attacker uses a packet sniffer to gain access to a victim's
session on a particular Web site by stealing the victim's session cookie
for that site. For instance, say I was sniffing traffic on the
network, and you logged in to Facebook and left the Remember Me On This
Computer check box checked. That signals Facebook to send you a
session cookie that your browser stores. I potentially could collect
that cookie through packet sniffing, add it to my browser and then
have access to your Facebook account. This is such a trivial task
that it can be scripted easily (someone even has made a Firefox
extension that will do it automatically), and there still aren't many
Web sites that encrypt their traffic to the end user,
making it a significant problem when using the public Internet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11086f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Session Cookies from the Network
</p></div></div><p>
Packet sniffers exist that are specifically designed for
monitoring what you are up to on the Internet. They will rebuild the
exact Web page you are looking at, photos you're browsing, videos
you're watching, and even files you're downloading. These applications
are tailored to look through a string of packet captures to find
various packet streams and reassemble them on the fly. My roommate in
college whipped up something that would display the contents of my
browser in real time on his computer (a scary revelation indeed).
</p><p>
E-mail is another one of those things that people tend to get up in arms
about because there's an assumption of privacy in e-mail that is
derived from the regular mail system. Your e-mail is sent out and
viewable, just like anything else that emanates from your computer of
the network. E-mail sniffing is what made the FBI's Carnivore program
so infamous.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd4580.0xecd0c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Carnivore</b></p><p>
Carnivore was a system implemented by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation that was designed to monitor e-mail and electronic
communications. It used a customizable packet sniffer that can monitor
all of a target user's Internet traffic.
</p></div><p>
Since every packet bears a destination address in its header, it's
possible that someone could sniff the network just to gather a
browsing history of everyone on that segment. This may not be very
insidious, but it's gathered data, and there's always someone willing
to pay for all sorts of data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd4580.0xecd328"></a>
Precautions</h2></div></div><p>
I'm sure you're currently seconds from taking a pair of scissors to
your network cable and swearing off the Internet for life, but fear
not! There are less-drastic measures you can take to prevent
such sensitive data loss. None of these precautions is the magic cure
for eavesdroppers, but using even one of them will make you a
less-desirable target. There's an old joke that says that when you're
being chased by a bear, you don't need to outrun the bear, just the
guy in front of you. You don't have to have the most secure computer
on the block, just more secure than somebody else's. As with most
network security, if people really want your data, they can get
at it. However, most of the time, attackers aren't targeting a
specific person, they're looking for targets of opportunity, so the
more secure you are, the less likely you are to be such a target.
</p><p>
The first defense against eavesdropping is the Secure Socket Layer 
(SSL) used by most Web pages that handle sensitive
information. This forces all the content shared back and forth
between you and the site to be encrypted. Some sites use SSL for
their login pages only. Most sites don't even use SSL at all. It's
easy to tell&mdash;the URL in the address bar will start with https
instead of http. Some sites offer you some choice in the matter.
For instance, Google allows you to turn SSL on all the time within
Gmail, thus encrypting all your e-mail traffic.
</p><p>
Modern network switches are designed to pass data intelligently to
avoid packet collisions and excessive network traffic. If a packet is
broadcast that is not intended for one of the nodes attached to it,
the router will not rebroadcast to the local nodes. Likewise, if a
packet is broadcast locally that is intended for another local node,
the switch will not rebroadcast to the outside network. This forces
strict segmentation on a network. For us, this means that someone
using a packet sniffer on a switched network will not see any traffic
from hosts not attached to the same switch. This doesn't mean much on
small-scale networks, like you have at your house, but on a larger
scale, it means that somebody can't sit in the breakroom sniffing
traffic three floors up from the accounting department.
</p><p>
Wireless network encryption has come a long way in its short
lifespan&mdash;going from no encryption to Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) encryption
to Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) encryption. Wireless networks
don't provide the same segmentation that the previously mentioned
switches provide, meaning that any packet transmitted on a wireless
access point gets rebroadcast to everyone else on the access point.
Even though your traffic is encrypted under WEP, this encryption 
protects only the data from users not connected to that wireless network.
The encryption scheme and key are identical for all users, so all your
&ldquo;encrypted&rdquo; data is decryptable by anyone on the network, making your
data essentially unencrypted. WPA solves this issue by isolating all
users on the network and giving them a different encryption scheme
even when the key is the same.
</p><p>
If you have SSH access to a computer outside your current network
(which I'm sure most of us do), you can tunnel all your traffic
through an SSH connection. You essentially are using the encryption
of the SSH connection to protect all your data from eavesdroppers.
There are two apparent downsides to this technique. First, you're
connection speed will drop, because now instead of going from you to
the destination and back, your traffic will go from you to the SSH
server to the destination and back. Second, your data is transmitted
unencrypted from the remote end, so if that machine is vulnerable to
packet sniffing, your data is no safer than it was at your local
machine.
</p><p>
Virtual private networks are intended to allow users access to a
network that otherwise would be inaccessible. However, they also can be
used to protect your traffic, because VPN connections are encrypted. You
can set up a private VPN for yourself just for this purpose, but it
will have the same disadvantages as SSH tunneling. If you work for a
company that has a VPN, you may be allowed to use it for this purpose,
but your traffic will fall under the same policy and rules that you have
in your office, so be careful what you use it for.
