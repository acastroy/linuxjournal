More and more often these days you need to work on remote machines.
What can you do when the command line isn't enough?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1e580.0x2b161f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Most people today are used to having a nice, intuitive graphical
environment when they sit down to use a computer. Gone are the days of
using a DOS machine or being lucky enough to have a dial-up account at
300 baud on a UNIX mainframe. Today, most people expect to be able to point
and click their way to work nirvana, even when that work is being done
on some other machine over a network. In this article, I look at some
of the available options, what the relative costs and benefits are,
and hopefully by the end, you should have enough information to make a
choice as to what would be the best option for you.
</p><p>
Before I begin though, I probably should take a look at what 
actually is involved in using a GUI on Linux. The overwhelming majority
of Linux users will be using the X11 Window System (typically
shortened to just X11). X11 has been around since 1987. Since then,
it has gone through several revisions, and it's currently at R7. Any
X11 installation you are likely to encounter will be some version
of X11R7. There have been attempts to replace it, including Wayland,
Berlin/Fresco and the Y Window System, but they are fairly rare out in
the wild, and you'll need to go out of your way to run into them.
</p><p>
X11 is built on a client-server model. In this model, the X11 server
is the part that actually draws on a physical screen. As such, it is
the part you end up running on your desktop in front of you. The
client portion in this model is the user-space program that has output
that needs to be seen by the end user.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11087f1.large.jpg"><img src="11087f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The X11 Window System (from Wikipedia)
</p></div></div><p>
The client does this by sending requests to the X11 server. These are high
level and of the form &ldquo;Draw a window&rdquo;, &ldquo;Add text to the
window border&rdquo;, &ldquo;Move the window to the right by x
pixels&rdquo;. Because of this, there 
potentially can be a lot of communication if a lot is going on.
</p><p>
When most people experience X11, both parts of this model are running on
the desktop in front of them. But, this isn't the only option. There is
no reason for the client and server to be on the same machine, or even
on the same continent. Because everything is done by sending messages,
those messages easily can be sent over a network connection.
</p><p>
The first thought that should come to you is &ldquo;Hey, I can open a window
on my friend's machine and display rude pictures there.&rdquo; Unfortunately,
the writers of the X11 specification have beaten you there and closed
that particular hole. By default, X11 servers are configured not to
accept connections from clients on the network. You have to 
allow this explicitly. You can use two separate mechanisms to allow
external connections. The older one is called xhosts. With xhosts,
you tell the X11 server to accept connections from the servers that you
permit. The command looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xhost +111.222.333.444
</pre>
</p><p>
The newer authentication mechanism is called xauth. In this method,
the X11 server creates a cookie that is required in order to connect to
the X11 server. If you want to connect to the X11 server from a remote
machine, you need to copy this cookie over to the remote
machine. An example of doing this, from the xauth man page is:

   
<pre     class="programlisting">
xauth extract - $DISPLAY | ssh otherhost xauth merge -
</pre>
</p><p>
This command pulls out the cookie for the current X11 server and
&ldquo;SSHes&rdquo;
it over to the remote machine and merges it into the user's xauth file.
</p><p>
Once you have done this, how do client applications go ahead and connect
to your X11 server? All programs that run under X11 accept certain command-line options. One of these is <tt  >-display</tt>. With this option, you can tell
your client program to which X11 server to connect and send its output.
The general form of this option is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-display hostname:display#.screen#
</pre>
</p><p>
The reason for all of the parts of this option is that a given machine could be
running more than one X11 server, and each server could be running more than one
display screen. The first server and screen is labeled as 0.0, so in most cases you
will use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-display hostname:0.0
</pre>
</p><p>
As an aside, you can do this on your desktop. If you open a terminal, you can run an
X11 client program with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-display :0.0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1e580.0x2b16d50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and it will show up on your default desktop.
</p><p>
A consequence of this is that you need to have a connection to the
remote machine that will be running the client program. Most times,
this connection will be over an SSH connection between your local
machine and the remote machine. Luckily, SSH provides the ability to
tunnel X11 traffic over your SSH connection for you. This tunneling
happens &ldquo;out-of-band&rdquo;, so to speak. You start a session by SSHing in to
your remote machine and using either the <tt  >-X</tt> or
<tt  >-Y</tt> options. The <tt  >-X</tt>
option is the preferred method. It sets up a secure X11 socket on the
remote machine using xauth as the authentication system. Unfortunately,
some X11 servers have a hard time with this, so you can use
<tt  >-Y</tt>. This
essentially turns off any authentication. It is equivalent to using
<tt  >xhost +</tt>.
</p><p>
Once your SSH connection is established, a new X11 socket is created
on the remote machine, and the environment variable DISPLAY is set to
point to it. From here on, any X11 applications you start on
this remote machine will send their output to your X11 server on your
desktop. When you do this, you may notice something. In most cases,
it is unbelievably slow&mdash;even slower than slow if the machine you are
connecting to is any appreciable distance away. Due, in part, to this
issue, the SSH developers have included an extra option,
<tt  >-C</tt>. This
turns on compression of the data traveling over the SSH connection. A
side effect is that the packets being sent containing the X11
protocol instructions get bunched together and sent as a single unit. This
makes much more efficient use of the bandwidth available, because you are
cutting down the amount of control data that also gets sent over the line.
</p><p>
As I mentioned above, both X11 and X11 over SSH are notoriously slow. In
some cases, it is nearly unusable. Luckily, there's another option
available, VNC. VNC also follows the client/server model, but it reverses
the location of the client and server from what you might be used to with
X11. With VNC, you run a server out on the remote machine and then use
a client on your desktop in front of you. You can run a VNC server in the
background, where it sits and acts like any other service. It also doesn't
use any of the standard X11 sockets, so it will not interfere with any
standard X11 desktop that also may be running on the remote machine.
Because
it runs as a service, it can continue to run, whether you are connected
to it or not. You can think of it as a GUI version of the old standby,
screen. 
</p><p>
There also are client applications for all the major operating
systems, and they are much lighter weight than a full X11 server. So,
you can start up vncserver on the remote machine, connect to it from your
Windows box, start some long-running process, disconnect and go home, and then
check on its progress from your Linux box. This is a great improvement
over straight X11. Also, you will notice that in most cases, it is a bit
more responsive than X11 was. This is due to the amount of information
being sent back and forth between the client and server parts of VNC.
</p><p>
The server command is simply <tt  >vncserver</tt>. When you run this command,
a directory named .vnc is created in your home directory if it doesn't
exist already. If a password has not been set yet for this instance of
the VNC server, it will ask you to enter one. It is saved in the file
passwd in encrypted form. If you want to change it, you can use the
command <tt  >vncpasswd</tt>. In this directory, you also
should find log files
for each instance of vncserver that you start, as well as a pid file
containing the PID of any currently running instances of vncserver. 
</p><p>
The
last file of interest is the xstartup file. This is the file that is
used when you start vncserver to set up all the required options and
also lay out what will be run on the vncserver desktop. The defaults on
my Ubuntu system look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title 
 &#8618;"$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &amp;
#x-window-manager &amp;
# Fix to make GNOME work
export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1
/etc/X11/Xsession
</pre>
</p><p>
So in this case, it sets the background to gray and then tries to run
whatever session is defined in the global script Xsession. This is where
you can do some editing and make it your own. I prefer Fluxbox as a window
manager on smaller screens. So you can simplify this to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
startfluxbox
</pre>
</p><p>
Starting this gives you a nice-looking desktop running Fluxbox. If the
client that is going to be connecting to this has to deal with a smaller
screen size (like on a Netbook), you can set the desktop size on the
command line with the <tt  >-geometry</tt> option. You also can set the color
depth of the virtual desktop with the <tt  >-depth</tt> option. So, to set up a
server that looks nice when I connect to it from my Netbook, I would use
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vncserver -geometry 800x600
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, what about the other end? There are two general classes of vncviewer
applications, GUI and command line. The GUI versions, like the most
common ones for Mac OS X and Windows, have point-and-click access to all
the relevant options. They also have them in different locations,
depending on who wrote your particular favorite viewer. Because VNC is a
protocol (kind of like FTP or HTTP), there is a great deal of variation in
what you get from the various implementers. Let's look at the command-line
versions here and see what you can do with those. The GUI versions should
have comparable options available. To connect to a vncserver, you would run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vncviewer hostname:port
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1e580.0x2b176f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >hostname</tt> is either the true hostname of the remote machine or its
IP address. <tt  >port</tt> is the port number on which the vncserver is listening,
starting at 1. This number is added to the default starting port number
5900, so the actual network port number in this case is 5901. This will
try to connect to the given server, and it will ask for a password if
one had been set during vncserver's startup. Then, you get a nice
Fluxbox desktop. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11087f2.large.jpg"><img src="11087f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Fluxbox Running under vncserver
</p></div></div><p>
There are
lots of options for changing various parts of what is being transmitted,
such as the encoding algorithm, the compression level and the quality
level. Playing with these options can improve your session's
responsiveness, 
potentially at the cost of some image quality. Depending
on what work you are trying to do, this may not be a trade-off
you are willing to make.
</p><p>
Although you can force some kind of authentication on VNC, that may
not be enough in these security-conscious days. You may have to work
with a remote machine that sits behind a firewall that allows only SSH
traffic. What can you do? VNC allows for tunneling of the protocol over an
SSH connection by using the <tt  >-via gateway</tt> option. This gateway machine
is the machine that you are SSHing in to for the tunneling. If this
is the same machine as your vncserver, the command would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vncviewer -via user@somehost.com localhost:1
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells vncviewer to <tt  >ssh</tt> to somehost.com as user &ldquo;user&rdquo;, then connect
to vncserver on the localhost to somehost.com&mdash;in other words, somehost.com
itself. There is no reason that these need to be the same machine. This
means you could connect to a vncserver on a machine behind a security
gateway machine. In this case, it would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vncviewer -via user@gateway.com someotherhost.com:1
</pre>
</p><p>
Be aware that VNC still will ask you to authenticate after the SSH
session has been established.

Hopefully, this article has provided some options for those times when
you just can't live without a nice graphical interface. Even when you
are forced to squeeze through an SSH connection, you still can have
all of that great GUI goodness. If you know of other ways of getting
a graphical interface on a remote machine, I would love to hear about
them.
