Why hack someone else when an ideal target might be lurking in
your own network?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x11143b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Although it's true that I tend to focus mostly on Linux in systems
administration (after all, that is my day job), I've always had a secondary
interest in security, whether it's hardening systems, performing forensics
on a hacked system, getting root on a pico projector or even trying my
hand at finding and exploiting vulnerabilities. Even though it's fun
to set up your own Web services and attempt to exploit them, there's
something more satisfying about finding vulnerabilities in someone
else's code. The downside, of course, is that most Webmasters don't
appreciate it when you break into their sites. However fun hacking is,
at least for me, it isn't worth the risk of jail time, so I need to have
my fun in more legal ways. This is where my wireless router comes in.
</p><p>
Wireless routers have a long history of being hackable. If you take any
group of Linux geeks, you are bound to find a number of them who have,
or have had, a member of the classic Linksys WRT series. If you look
on-line, there are all sorts of custom firmware you can install to extend
its functionality. Although it's true that on some versions of the router
you have to jump through some crazy hoops to install custom firmware,
it's still not the same kind of challenge as discovering and exploiting
a vulnerability on a server. Although I have a stack of WRT54G routers,
this article isn't about them; instead, it's about the D-Link DIR-685.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x11145c0"></a>
The D-Link DIR-685</h2></div></div><p>
I first became aware of the D-Link DIR-685 during a Woot-Off on
woot.com. If you are familiar with Woot-Offs, you understand that when
a new product shows up on the site, you have a limited time to decide
whether
you want to buy it before it disappears and a new product shows up. The
moment I read the specs, I knew this router looked promising. First, it
was an 802.11n router, and I was in the market to upgrade from my 802.11g
network. Second, it had five different gigabit ports in the back along
with two USB ports. Finally, as icing on the cake, it not only had this
interesting-looking color LCD on the front that could show statistics,
photos or other data, but you also could slot a 2.5" SATA drive up to 1Tb
and turn the thing into a small NAS. Based on the fact that it required
an ext3 filesystem on the 2.5" drive, I reasonably could assume it even
already ran Linux. I didn't have much time to see if anyone already
had hacked into the router or created custom firmware, so I made up my mind
and clicked the order button.
</p><p>
While I was waiting for the router to ship to my house, I did some extra
research. Although unfortunately it looked like there wasn't any custom
firmware I could find (this originally was quite an expensive router, so
I imagine it didn't have a large install base), I did find a site from
someone who documented how to open up the router and wire up and connect
a serial port to it, so you could access the local serial console. I
decided that in the worst case, if I couldn't find a simpler method, I always
could just go that route.
</p><p>
When I got the router, I did the initial setup on my network via the Web
interface and then looked one last time for any custom firmware or other
method apart from a serial console to get root on the router. I wasn't
able to find anything, but before I went to the trouble of taking it
apart, I decided to poke around on the Web interface and see if I saw
anything obvious. The first dead end came when I enabled the FTP service
via the Web interface, yet was not able to find any known vulnerabilities
with that FTP server that I could exploit. Unlike when I got root on my pico
projector, when I ran an nmap against the machine, I wasn't lucky enough
to have telnet waiting for me:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
80/tcp  open  http
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1114828"></a>
One Ping Only</h2></div></div><p>
As I continued searching though, I got my first clue: the ping test. The
Web interface provides a complete set of diagnostic tools that, among other
things, allows you to ping remote machines to test for connectivity on
http://&lt;router ip&gt;/tools_vct.php (Figure 1). I figured there was a good
chance that the PHP script just forwarded the hostname or IP address you
typed in to a system call that ran ping, so I started by adding a semicolon
and an <tt  >ls</tt> command to my input. Unfortunately, there was a JavaScript
routine that sanitized the input, but what I noticed was that after I
submitted a valid input, the variable also showed up in the URL:
http://&lt;router ip&gt;/tools_vct.php?uptime=175036&amp;pingIP=127.0.0.1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11115f1.large.jpg"><img src="11115f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Ping Test
</p></div></div><p>
I discovered that although the page used JavaScript to sanitize the input,
it did not sanitize the POST data. In fact, I could put just about
anything I wanted as the value of pingIP, and it would not only accept
it, but because the PHP page displayed the value of pingIP in the output,
I also would see my variable output in the resulting Web page, which opened up
all sorts of possibilities for JavaScript injection and XSS attacks. Of
course, none of that would help me get root on the machine, so I started
trying to figure out what kind of payload I could send that would allow
me to execute system calls.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1114bf0"></a>
No Escape</h2></div></div><p>
It was at this point that I searched on-line for a nice complete table
of all of the URL escape codes. You may have noticed that whenever you
type a space in a URL, for instance, browsers these days tend to convert
it into %20. That is just one of many different escape codes for symbols
that are valid to have in a URL in their escaped form. Table 1 shows some of the more
useful ones for what I was trying to achieve.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1114cf8"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. URL Escape Codes</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1. URL Escape Codes11115t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Escape Code</th><th>Character</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>
%3B</td><td>;</td></tr><tr><td>
%3F</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>

%3C</td><td>&lt;</td></tr><tr><td>
%3E</td><td>&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>
%7C</td><td>|</td></tr><tr><td>
%60</td><td>`</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
So, for instance, to perform a simple test of command injection, you
might attempt to add a sleep command. If the page seems to pause for
that amount of time before it reloads, that's a good sign your command
injection worked. So, to attempt a sleep command with that page, my
encoded URL to set pingIP to &ldquo;127.0.0.1; sleep 30&rdquo; looked like
http://&lt;router
ip&gt;/tools_vct.php?uptime=175036&amp;pingIP=127.0.0.1%3B%20sleep%2030.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1115900"></a>
&ldquo;If it's PHP, there <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be a
hole.&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>
I iterated through all sorts of different symbols and options to pass
for pingIP, and nothing I tried seemed to have any effect. I was talking
to a friend of mine about what I was trying and how I wasn't turning up
any usable hole yet, and I got the encouraging reply, &ldquo;If it's PHP, there
<span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> be a hole.&rdquo; I figured that if I already managed to
find a JavaScript injection XSS vulnerability, if I kept looking, I had
to find some way in. I decided to forget about the ping page for a while
and try to find some other vulnerability.
</p><p>
My next clue came when I looked into the system tools page at
http://&lt;router ip&gt;/tools_system.php (Figure 2). A glaring item on
that page was the reboot button. I figured there was at least a chance
that it made some sort of system call, so I looked into the source for
that Web page in my browser and noticed that when you clicked on the
reboot button, the JavaScript called this URL: http://&lt;router
ip&gt;/sys_config_valid.xgi?exeshell=submit%20REBOOT. There's nothing more
reassuring than a CGI variable named exeshell. Because I had all sorts
of example encoded URLs from my ping test, I decided to try enclosing
a sleep command in backticks to see if it would exit to a shell&mdash;low and
behold, it worked!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11115f2.large.jpg"><img src="11115f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. System Tools Page
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x110c660"></a>
The Payload</h2></div></div><p>
Okay, so now I had a viable way to execute shell commands on the system. The
next question was how I was going to take advantage of this to log in
remotely. My first approach was to try to execute netcat, have it listen
on a high port, and use the -e argument so that it would execute a
shell once I connected to that port&mdash;a poor man's telnetd. After all,
many consumer devices that run Linux use BusyBox for their shell,
and BusyBox often includes a version of netcat that supports this
option. Unfortunately, no combination of netcat arguments I tried seemed to
do anything. I was starting to think that I didn't get a shell after
all&mdash;that is, until I enclosed reboot in backticks, and it rebooted the router.
</p><p>
After the machine came back up, I decided it was possible netcat just
wasn't installed, so it was then that I tried the fateful URL:
http://&lt;router ip&gt;/sys_config_valid.xgi?exeshell=%60telnetd%20%26%60.
</p><p>
In case you don't want to look it up, that converts into
<tt  >`telnetd &amp;`</tt>
as input. Sure enough, after I ran that command, my nmap output looked a
bit different:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PORT    STATE SERVICE
21/tcp  open  ftp
23/tcp  open  telnet
80/tcp  open  http
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I fired up telnet from that same machine:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ telnet &lt;router ip&gt;
Trying &lt;router ip&gt;...
Connected to &lt;router ip&gt;.
Escape character is '^]'.

BusyBox v1.00 (2009.07.27-14:12+0000) Built-in shell (msh)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

#

</pre>
</p><p>
I not only got a shell, but also a root shell! When I ran a
<tt  >ps</tt> command, I
noticed my telnetd process on the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sh -c `telnetd &amp;` &gt; /dev/console

</pre>
</p><p>
It turns out any command you pass to exeshell just gets passed to
<tt  >sh -c</tt>, so
I didn't need any fancy escaped backticks or ampersands,
<tt  >exeshell=telnetd</tt>
would work just fine.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
So, what's the moral to this story? Well, for one, don't open up hardware
and void its warranty to get to a serial console when you can get a shell
from the Web interface. Two, JavaScript isn't sufficient to sanitize
inputs&mdash;if you accept POST data, you need to sanitize it as well. Three,
passing an input variable directly to sh is probably a bad idea. Finally,
next time you want to try your hand at a bit of penetration testing,
you don't have to go any further than your own network. Hacking your
own hardware can be just as fun (and safer) than hacking someone else.
