RunRev's LiveCode Server</h2></div></div><p>
LiveCode Server from RunRev is a new and novel solution that provides
back-end and cloud services for mobile or desktop applications and
processes. The advantage of LiveCode Server, says RunRev, is to enable
developers to create data-intensive apps with confidence that the sheer
volume of information and files required are kept securely in the cloud and
readily accessible. LiveCode is a programmable server environment that
allows developers to write flexible CGI scripts, rather than obscure
symbolic languages. An English-like programming language is used to 
describe server application logic quickly and build and deploy solutions
rapidly.
Users can use the LiveCode server as a standalone engine to install on
their own Mac OS or Linux hardware or utilize RunRev's On-Rev
hosting service.

Sencha Touch Charts</h2></div></div><p>
The thrill of Sencha Touch Charts lies not merely in the ability to explore
complex data sets with simple gestures on a smartphone or tablet, but more
important, to do so using HTML5. Sencha says that its new Web app
development framework renders charts at the same level of fidelity as
native apps without having to rely on native drawing packages. Sencha Touch
Charts renders charts, captures multi-touch inputs and drives
interactivity. A simple swipe will pan across a data set, whereas a
&ldquo;reverse pinch&rdquo; will zoom into detail. Richer interactions, such as
axis swaps, aggregation, filtering and more, are all enabled by similarly
simple gestures. The HTML5 Canvas technology is fully supported by the
latest WebKit browsers that ship with Android, Apple iOS, BlackBerry OS6
and HP WebOS.

SSVV Narasimha Rao's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sencha Touch 1.0 Mobile JavaScript
Framework</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
As long as we're on the topic of Sencha Touch, allow us to note that
extensive help already is available, so you can utilize the platform to
maximum benefit. Narasimha Rao's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sencha Touch 1.0 Mobile JavaScript
Framework</em></span> teaches all one needs to know to get started with Sencha
Touch and &ldquo;build awesome mobile Web applications that look and feel
native on Apple iOS and Google Android touchscreen devices&rdquo;, says
publisher Packt Publishing. Beginning with an overview of Sencha Touch, the
book guides users through increasingly complex sample applications. Other
topics include styling the UI, exploring Sencha Touch components and
working with animations and data packages using comprehensive examples.

Lantronix and Timesys' PremierWave EN</h2></div></div><p>
The new Linux-based, wireless device server PremierWave EN is a
collaborative effort between secure communication technologies provider
Lantronix and embedded Linux specialist Timesys. PremierWave EN allows
design engineers and OEMs to add Wi-Fi and Ethernet networking to
virtually any device easily. As a result, companies can transmit medical,
financial, customer or other important data securely across corporate networks.
Lantronix applications, such as the Advanced Applications Suite, tunneling
applications, an enterprise-class command-line interface, management
capability using a standard Web browser, diagnostic utilities,
Ethernet-to-Wireless LAN bridging and virtual IP are standard. A
subscription to Timesys' LinuxLink embedded Linux software development
framework also is included.

McObject's eXtremeDB Cluster</h2></div></div><p>
Step one to database nirvana: clear your mind of the most undelicious fast-food
item imaginable out of your head (that is, a McObject). Step two: with mind now
clear, check out McObject's new eXtremeDB Cluster, which the company bills
as the first clustering database system built especially for distributed
embedded software and real-time enterprise applications. eXtremeDB Cluster
manages data stores across multiple hardware nodes, which increases the net
processing power available for data management; reduces system expansion
costs; and delivers a scalable and reliable database solution for
increasingly data-intensive real-time applications. According to McObject's
benchmarks, eXtremeDB Cluster delivered a 161% throughput improvement when
scaling to four nodes from one. Targeted applications include carrier-grade
telecom, algorithmic trading applications, SaaS platforms and the like.

Vector Fabrics' vfThreaded-x86 Tool</h2></div></div><p>
Take your pick&mdash;expletives and ibuprofen or Vector Fabrics'
vfThreaded-x86 Tool&mdash;to take the pain out of the task of optimization
and parallelization of applications for multicore x86 architectures. The
cloud-based software tool, which is aimed at developers who write
performance-centric code for high-performance computing, scientific,
industrial, video or imaging applications, greatly reduces the time
involved and the risks associated with optimizing code for the latest
multicore x86 processors. By using thorough dynamic and static code
analysis techniques, vfThreaded-x86 quickly analyzes code and guides the
developer to make the right choices for partitioning code to separate
cores. This includes examining cache hit/miss effects, data bandwidth to
memories and bandwidth between individual code sections. An intuitive GUI
provides code visualizations that highlight code hotspots and dependencies
that might require partitioning
trade-offs.

Scott Mueller's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Upgrading and Repairing PCs</em></span>, 20th Ed. (Que)</h2></div></div><p>
Besides our fealty to Linux, there may be nothing else besides tinkering
with our PCs that defines our Linux geek identity. Therefore, we know that
books like Scott Mueller's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Upgrading and Repairing PCs</em></span>, now in its 20th
edition, will appeal to many of our readers. Publisher Que calls Mueller's
book &ldquo;the definitive guide to the inner workings of the latest
PCs&rdquo;
and &ldquo;with nearly 2.5 million copies sold, it's the best-selling
hardware guide ever&rdquo;. The book contains extensive information on
troubleshooting problems, improving system performance and making the most
of today's best new hardware. The latest hardware innovations and repair
techniques since the previous edition have been added. Ninety minutes of
DVD video is included, covering insider information about several key PC
components, including hard disk drives, power supplies, motherboards and so
on.
Besides presenting comprehensive coverage of every PC component, Mueller
also covers overclocking, cooling, PC diagnostics, testing and
maintenance.

Cutting Edge's Power-Saving Cloud Archive</h2></div></div><p>
From the &ldquo;saving green by going green&rdquo; newsdesk is Cutting Edge's new
Power-Saving Cloud Archive (PSCA), an energy-saving storage technology for
the cloud. Cutting Edge describes PSCA's advantages to include
&ldquo;extremely high performance and scalability, a low acquisition cost, up
to a 90% power savings and a new low in TCO for organizations that are
struggling to address the relentless flood of unstructured data and longer
retention times&rdquo;. Moreover, PSCA, says the company &ldquo;is the ideal
solution for today's power-hungry storage environments where the cost to
provide power and cooling for storage systems now actually exceeds the cost
to acquire the equipment being powered and cooled&rdquo;. Cutting Edge's
technology is a combination of its fifth-generation EdgeWare unified
storage software and multi-tiered archiving, as well as innovative
power-saving hardware and open systems.
