    Here's a quick lesson in setting up scripts to use the ssh
    and make commands for compiling on a remote machine.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208b580.0x21833a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Occasionally I use my Linux machine at
home to write code that I intend to compile on a remote machine.
</p><p>While maintaining open FTP and TELNET connections to the
remote machine to handle the transfer and compilation steps is a
manageable solution, I decided to explore
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> to develop a more automated
method.</p><p>The benefits of my solution:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No need to remember which files have been
modified.</p></li><li><p>Ability to use Emacs' compilation capabilities to
move to errors in the source.</p></li><li><p>As mentioned above, no need to use FTP or TELNET,
and hence no reason to keep an open dial-up connection when not
compiling.</p></li><li><p>Automate, automate, automate&mdash;laziness is a
virtue.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208b580.0x2183920"></a>Overview of Solution</h2></div></div><p>My first step was to set up ssh and related tools in order to
allow secure copying of files to my remote system. While setting up
a .rhosts file is a (barely) acceptable solution, my IP address and
name is different each time I dial in, and it would be rather
awkward to change the remote system's .rhosts file each time I
dialed in.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> gives me a much more
secure form of authentication for copying files and executing
remote commands.</p><p>Once I had ssh behaving properly, I used Emacs'
<span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span> facility to explore implicit
rules in Makefiles and wrote a simple Makefile to handle the file
transfers and remote compilation.</p><p>As an example of the intended effect, assume my remote
machine is called &ldquo;remote&rdquo; (and my local machine &ldquo;local&rdquo;), and
I've just modified a source file called daemon.c. I would like to
execute the following commands in an automated fashion (note that
<span   class="bold"><b>scp</b></span> is a secure copy command
packaged with ssh, and that the <b  >-C</b> option
specifies compression, useful for dialup connections):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scp -C daemon.c jdaily@remote:~/source-directory
ssh -C remote "cd source-directory &amp;&amp; make"
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x208b580.0x2183ce8"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>First, I needed <span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> running
on the remote system to handle my secure connections. Fortunately,
sshd was already running on the remote system in question.
According to the man pages, it can be run by any user (i.e., user
does not have to be root) and is restricted to handling connections
for that user (which should provide sufficient security for our
needs).</p><p>Then, I needed to install the ssh tool set on my local
machine. Again, ideally these would be installed in a public binary
directory such as /usr/local/bin, but any user can install them in
his/her home directory.</p><p>I also wanted a key which would allow me to authenticate
myself between systems and eliminate the need to type my password
each time I tried to run one of the ssh commands. For this, I ran
ssh-keygen and made sure not to give a pass phrase, so that none
would be needed when using my private key to establish the
connection. <a href="2621l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows an
example ssh-keygen session.</p><p>Once I had a public key, I used scp to copy it to the remote
machine.</p><p>$ scp -C ~/.ssh/identity.pub
\jdaily@remote:~/.ssh/keyjdaily's password: &lt;entered my remote
password&gt;</p><p>Then I logged onto the remote host and copied the key file
into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. If that file had already existed, I
would have appended the key file.</p><p>Following all this, I could run ssh and scp without needing
either a password or a pass phrase to connect to remote.</p><p>Now I needed a makefile to automate my system. Ideally, the
files on the remote machine would be checked to see if they were
older than the files on my local machine, and if so, they would be
replaced. To simplify matters, I decided to keep a record of the
&ldquo;last transferred date&rdquo; for each file by touching a corresponding
file each time I copied a source file over.</p><p>As an example, when I transferred a newer copy of daemon.c
over, I touched daemon.ct in the same directory. Any transfer of a
.h file would be marked by the creation of a file with a .ht
suffix.</p><p>After poking around the info file for make, I came up with
the Makefile shown in <a href="2621l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a>
This Makefile had one limitation in particular; I was unable to
specify command-line arguments for make on the remote machine
without writing them directly into the makefile on my local system.
While this was fine for the current application, I decided to
generalize it by creating a
<span   class="bold"><b>run-make</b></span> shell script which would
handle the remote execution of make after calling make on the local
system. <a href="2621l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> is my run-make
shell script. I then removed the line from my Makefile which
remotely ran make. <a href="2621l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a> is
the output from a successful compilation sequence.</p><p><a href="2621s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
