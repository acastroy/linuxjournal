introduction to a wide variety of topics related to installing,
configuring and using Linux. It covers installation in depth and
introduces other topics by giving an overview with examples and
referring the reader to other good resources. Depending on your
view, the resource pointers, which are used extensively, can be a
strength or weakness.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with Linux, and with little prior
experience with any other Unix-type operating system,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> offers a mountain of
well-structured information to help get you on your feet. Unlike
some other introductory books, it rarely gets bogged down with too
many details about a particular feature, task or program.</p><p>In the course of reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span>,
you will be introduced to virtually all aspects of using and
maintaining your new Linux system. For those left puzzled by their
first root shell prompt, it provides a comprehensive path to
becoming a Linux user/administrator, from adding accounts to
changing passwords to configuring printers.</p><p>From there, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> also provides
information about fun, interesting and even profitable things to do
with your system. Each of these sections are laid out clearly and
conveniently. The chapter on programming, for example, offers an
overview of popular editors, debuggers and their interfaces and
programming languages, giving you a taste of each and allowing you
to follow-up with other references.</p><p>The references, too, are comprehensive, including HOWTOs,
info and man pages, web and ftp sites and other books. Readers may
be disappointed at the frequent need to refer to outside sources to
get more information&mdash;this definitely isn't the only Linux book or
resource you'll ever need. From this shortcoming, however, comes an
interesting strength; the book often gives pointers to resources
that are continually kept up to date, eliminating the pitfall of
going into depth about a program feature and then having a new
version of the software render the information obsolete.</p><p>If you're an experienced Unix or Linux user, you may find
that there isn't much material covered that you haven't run into at
one time or another. Since no subject is covered in great depth,
you're not likely to find some hidden piece of information about a
program you've been using for a while. However, the scope of the
book is such that even if you've been hacking away for a few years,
you'll probably still find some bit of information you never knew
before. In addition, if you haven't used GNU or other freely
available tools before, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> is a
fairly good introduction, although if you have a specific tool in
mind, a specific book would probably be a better source of
information.</p><p>While <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> is in its second
edition, there are a few fairly dated passages, but these are not
common. This is quite forgiveable, for Linux is constantly changing
and updating, and any book about Linux initially written over two
years ago is bound to have them. Another minor disappointment is
the chapter on multimedia which provides only a cursory glimpse at
the subject.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> is a worthwhile book for
the Linux newcomer. Veterans to Linux and Unix may find it
interesting, but not as useful.</p></div></div>
