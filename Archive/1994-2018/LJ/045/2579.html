screen for my system. Which touch screens are supported by
Linux? &mdash;Cheng Yap Red Hat 4.2</p><p>Touch screen support depends on the X server you are using.
I'm not sure which (if any) touch screens are supported by XFree86.
If a commercial server is an option, Metro-X has support for some
touch screens. You can get more information about it at
http://www.metrolink.com/. &mdash;Steven Pritchard, President Southern
Illinois Linux Users Group steve@silug.org</p><p>There is not yet a standard for touch screens. Each
manufacturer has different requirements and features. They also
have different methods of communicating &ldquo;touch&rdquo; information to
the PC.</p><p>Your best bet is to find a touch screen that communicates
using one of the common mouse protocols. You then hook the screen
(or cover that slips onto a screen) to a communications port on
your PC and install <span   class="bold"><b>GPM</b></span> or tell X
to use that port as its mouse port. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT

NT 4.0 machines. I'd like to convert more machines to Linux boxes
but can't, at this time, so I want to share resources between these
machines. How can I easily share files between Linux and Windows NT
machines? Also, can I share printers?</p><p>Ideally, I'd like to get the Linux machine to act as a file
server for the NT workstations, since I didn't shell out the extra
for NT Server. Is this possible? &mdash;Alex Tan Red Hat 4.2</p><p>SAMBA can give you the exact functionality you describe in
your e-mail. Using SAMBA you can configure your Linux box to act
both as a file and printer server for your NT (or Windows 95)
machines. For more information about installing and configuring
SAMBA check the SMB-HOWTO in your /usr/doc/HOWTO directory. &mdash;Mario

Perl. I have no idea of how to even begin. I've been told that I
need to download it first. Do I? From which site? Is there
documentation on step by step installation? &mdash;Enrique Estrada Red Hat
4.1</p><p>You're in luck, because Perl is already a part of Red Hat 4.1
. If you did a standard installation it is probably already
installed. To confirm this, at the shell prompt type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -v
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If perl is installed, it will report back the
current version number. If it was missed during the installation
process, you'll need to read up on using the Red Hat Package
Manager (RPM) to install it from the disks.</em></span>
</p><p>If you want to download the latest versions you can pick them
up from many different sites. The web pages at http://www.perl.com/
are a great starting point. &mdash;Vince Waldon vwaldon@redcross.ca</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17c37c0"></a>Parallel Tape Device Support</h2></div></div><p>I am searching for parallel port drivers for my employer, and
I have come across some parallel port drivers for tape drives such
as the HP Colorado Trakker 250. Unfortunately, this is not the one
that I need. Have there been any recent developments in parallel
port drivers for Linux and, if so, what projects are complete,
underway or planned for the future? &mdash;Scott Mulroy</p><p>A lot of pointers are available on the Linux Parallel Port
home page at URL http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html/. &mdash;Pierre
Ficheux, Lectra Syst&egrave;m&egrave;s pierre@rd.lectra.fr</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17c3920"></a>Sound Drivers for S.u.S.E</h2></div></div><p>I'm very satisfied with my S.u.S.E. Linux distribution, but
I'm not able to make my Soundblaster 16 PnP (plug and play) work.
Do you have any suggestions? &mdash;Stefan Stahl S.u.S.E. 5.0</p><p>The best solution for me was to use
<span   class="bold"><b>Pnp4Kernel</b></span>. You can get it from
the Red Hat Linux-PnP web page
(http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/pnp/).</p><p>Another easy solution is to buy the commercial sound driver
by 4 Front Technologies (OSS). It's cheap ($20), easy to install
and works well. Check out
http://www.4front-tech.com/linux/. &mdash;Pierre Ficheux, Lectra

Windows 3.1, 95 or NT working under Linux? All drivers are normally
installed in the Windows directory and the printer is not able do
anything without Windows. &mdash;Jan Rooijackers InfoMagic April
1997</p><p>That depends entirely upon your printer's facilities. First,
run a quick test from MS-DOS. Click Start, Shut Down and then
Restart in MS-DOS mode. At the command prompt, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
copy c:\autoexec.bat lpt1
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>replacing <b>lpt1</b> with your
printer. If your printer produces a printout of your autoexec.bat
file, you know your printer does not require special software to
function, and Linux should be able to operate the printer without
difficulty. If it does not, it's possible that the manufacturer (to
save money) has removed functionality from the printer itself and
placed it in the driver, in the same manner that the &ldquo;WinModem&rdquo;
was created.</em></span>
</p><p>If you are able to print without the driver, you should then
look to see what command set your printer emulates. The industry
standard is Hewlett Packard's PCL. Many printers directly support
this standard or can be configured to support it. &mdash;Chad Robinson,
