    Cookies are an excellent way of keeping track of users who
    visit a web site. Here's how to use them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164e580.0x17464a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The overwhelming majority of URLs begin
with the letters &ldquo;http&rdquo;, which stands for &ldquo;hypertext transfer
protocol&rdquo;. Just as e-mail is transferred using SMTP (Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol) and files are often retrieved using FTP (File
Transfer Protocol), files written in HTML are generally transmitted
using HTTP.
</p><p>Why did the Web's inventors create a new protocol for
transmitting hypertext, rather than sticking with previous ones?
One answer is that they were interested in allowing servers to
respond quickly and efficiently to requests from browsers. The
client (browser) side of an HTTP transaction consists of a request
for a document, containing several optional parameters, describing
the document's content type and its last modification date. The
server responds to the request by describing the document,
including its content type, and returning the document. Once the
document is sent, the server closes the connection. By exchanging a
minimum of information and then breaking the connection, documents
are transmitted with a low overhead, and thus, at a relatively fast
clip.</p><p>This &ldquo;statelessness&rdquo;--the fact that each connection is used
to transmit a single document and that each transaction takes place
in a vacuum&mdash;was a terrific idea in the early days of the Web. It
meant that browsers and servers had to keep track of very little
information when transmitting documents, thus reducing the size and
increasing the speed for these programs.</p><p>As a result, if we look at the access log from a typical web
server, we see a list of document requests as well as the IP
address (i.e., the number that uniquely identifies a computer on
the Internet) of the computer from which the request originated. We
do not, however, know whether three requests made from the same
computer at roughly the same time were made by the same person or
by three different people.</p><p>In many cases this would not be a problem; after all, if my
web site is set up to serve out pages of HTML, then I probably
don't care whether 1,000 different people have visited my site or
if the same person has read 1,000 documents. For many sites
statelessness does not present any obstacles.</p><p>However, many site owners, particularly commercial ones, are
increasingly frustrated with the Web's inherent statelessness. It
is much easier to sell advertising when you have a precise count of
the number of people visiting your site, rather than a list of how
many times each document was accessed. The number of &ldquo;hits&rdquo;, or
individual HTTP requests received by a server, is a reasonable
measure of a site's success only in the non-profit and personal
sector; commercial sites are far more interested in how many pages
were viewed by a given number of individuals.</p><p>Even small personal sites occasionally like to keep track of
users. If you want to personalize a user's view of your site, a way
to keep track of each user's preferences rather than a setting
which applies to all users. And, while you could certainly get a
user's name (and password, if necessary) via HTML forms, forcing
the user to enter this on every page, or even upon arriving at your
site's home page, would be a great burden on the user.</p><p>This month we will look at one of the most popular ways to
keep track of user state, best known as HTTP cookies. Cookies allow
servers to store small pieces of data on the user's computer, and
thus to keep track of a user's movements on our site. Note that
while cookies can be used to keep track of a user's movements, and
potentially build a profile which might be of use to advertisers,
they cannot collect any information which the user does not
provide. Fears of privacy abuse might be true in some cases (and
designers should recognize that cookies will offend and upset some
users), but the fear that cookies can somehow collect information
from your computer without your knowledge is off the mark. Cookies
simply make it much easier to create interesting sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164e580.0x1746818"></a>What is a Cookie?</h2></div></div><p>Cookies are small (up to 4KB) pieces of data stored on the
user's computer by his browser. In addition to a name,value pair,
cookies are tagged with expiration dates limiting the length of
time they may be stored, as well as an indicator of the Internet
host or domain that originally created the cookie.</p><p>The basic rule to remember when dealing with cookies is that
the value of a cookie is set by the server using HTTP responses,
and browsers return those values using HTTP requests. It's a bit
disconcerting to think of things this way; we are not used to
responses from servers containing a request of their own.</p><p>Let's say that we have a CGI program that returns a small bit
of HTML when invoked. Assuming that the program is in the /cgi-bin
directory and is called sample.pl, our browser would retrieve it by
connecting to the server on port 80 and issuing a request like this
one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
GET /cgi-bin/sample.pl HTTP/1.0
</pre><p>This request says that we are using HTTP 1.0 and would like
the server to send us the document /cgi-bin/sample.pl. The server,
because of its configuration options, knows that anything in
/cgi-bin is a program, and so it executes sample.pl, returning the
output. Here is an example of what sample.pl might return:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/html
  &lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Test&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
  &lt;Body&gt;&lt;P&gt;Test&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/Body&gt;
  &lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>


The above is about as minimal as a modern HTTP transaction can get.
A single header (<b  >Content-type</b>) following the
status code and preceding the message body is returned. Most of the
time, more information is included in the response headers, such as
the server name and version number and the date on which the
document was created. If the server wants to set a cookie on the
browser's computer, it must include an additional header, named
<b  >Set-cookie</b>. Just as the
<b  >Content-type</b> header defines the type of data
that is being returned in the response, the
<b  >Set-cookie</b> header defines the name and value for
a cookie that applies to the site from which the response
originated.
</p><p>For example, <a href="2565l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
contains a short program (cookie-test.pl) that creates a cookie on
the user's computer. If we run cookie-test.pl from a web browser,
we see the HTML output produced by the program. If it were not for
the program's polite indication that it had set a cookie, we would
never know unless we asked our browser to warn us each time. (I
tried this feature on discovering it in Netscape Navigator 3.0, but
I quickly turned it off when I discovered how often such dialog
boxes were interfering with my web browsing and how innocuous most
of them appeared to be.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164e580.0x1746ce8"></a>How Browsers See Cookies</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >Set-cookie</b> header becomes obvious if
we use <span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> to look at the
output sent by the program. From my computer running Red Hat Linux
4.2, I type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet localhost 80
</pre><p>which opens a connection to the Apache HTTP server running on
my computer. I then type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
GET /cgi-bin/cookie-test.pl HTTP/1.0
</pre>


followed by two line-feed characters, which indicates the end of my
request. As in the example above, my server knows that anything in
/cgi-bin is actually supposed to execute cookie-test.pl and to send
the output from that program to the user's browser. When I enter
the above request and press the return key twice (once to end the
request line and another to indicate that we have finished the
entire request), I get the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Date: Tue, 23 Sep 1997 09:15:42 GMT
  Server: Apache/1.2.4
  Set-cookie: counter=1; path=/cgi-bin/
  Connection: close
  Content-Type: text/html
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN"&gt;
  &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Cookie set&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;P&gt;The cookie named "counter" has
  been set to 1.&lt;/P&gt;
  &lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>


The above response is a bit more detailed than the skeleton
response that we looked at above, but its contents should still be
fairly clear. We get a 200 (&ldquo;OK&rdquo;) message from the web server,
the date at which the document was created, the server that
produced the response, the connection type and the content type.
</p><p>The <b  >Set-cookie</b> header tells our browser
that we should now hold onto a cookie named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>counter</em></span>, whose value should be 1. In the
future, every time my browser asks for a document in the cgi-bin
path from this host, it will send the value of the counter cookie,
which will still be set to 1. <a href="2565l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a> is a short CGI program that prints the names and values
of all cookies sent to it.</p><p>Note that our program only sees a single cookie, while I know
that my browser has held onto far more cookies that this. I do not
have to enter my password when entering certain sites at which I
have registered, and there are a large number of cookies in
~/.netscape/cookies, the file in which the Netscape's browsers
place cookies. Why does only one cookie appear?</p><p>The answer is that when a browser visits a site, it only
sends those cookies that were created by that site. Thus, when I am
accessing my local web server, only those cookies created by my
local web server are available to CGI programs there. If I were to
access <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span>, only those cookies
set by the nytimes.com domain would be available to their system.
One of the cornerstones of the cookie specification is that the
cookie name and value pair should only be sent to the hosts or
domains that created them.</p><p>Those of you worried that information about your web browsing
interests is shared among sites (and thus violate your privacy)
might still be right&mdash;but this cannot happen automatically with
cookies unless all of the sites you visit are within the same
domain. Indeed, HotWired used to have several sites with a shared
password system that relied on cookies. Because the sites all had
different domain names, however, I had to have a separate cookie on
my system for each sub-site. The result was that I had to enter my
user name and password the first time I visited each of these
sites.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164e580.0x17472c0"></a>Storing Useful Values</h2></div></div><p>Now we know how to create cookies. Our CGI program uses
CGI.pm's <b  >cookie</b> method to create one with a name
and value, and then puts it into the header returned to the
browser. We also know how to write programs that can grab cookies'
values. To get a list of all cookies, use the same
<span   class="bold"><b>cookie</b></span> method, then iterate
through the list of names that it returns. Once we have those
names, we can retrieve the values with the
<span   class="bold"><b>cookie</b></span> method, giving it an
argument of a particular cookie name.</p><p>Storing a value isn't of much use unless we can also change
it. Our next task is to combine parts of cookie-test.pl and
show-cookies.pl into a single program which increments the counter
cookie value each time we visit the site, displaying its value each
time. The first time we visit this CGI program, it sets the
cookie's value to 1, the second time we visit, it will set the
value to 2 and so on.</p><p>You can see a bare-bones attempt at this sort of program in
<a href="2565l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a> As you can see, the
code is fairly straightforward. We create an instance of CGI and
use the <span   class="bold"><b>cookie</b></span> method to extract
the value of the counter cookie. We increment that value by 1,
create a new counter cookie with the updated value and send that
value back as part of the header to the program's response. The
body of the response contains a short listing of the names and
values of each cookie in the system.</p><p>Each time we invoke update-counter.pl, the user's browser
recognizes counter as a cookie with the appropriate host or domain
name and path, and thus sends counter as a cookie with its request.
Update-counter.pl grabs the value of the cookie if it exists and
sets it to 0 if it does not. It then increments the value of the
cookie and creates a new (outgoing) cookie with the counter name
and the updated value. This new cookie is included in the headers
which update-counter.pl sends to the user's browser, and the value
of the cookie is displayed in the body of the response which
contains HTML-formatted text.</p><p>This program may not seem very useful, but with a few small
variations, it could be useful in a plethora of situations. For
example, you could ensure that users only enter a questionnaire
once or keep track of how many times they have requested technical
support via the Web rather than by telephone. Another possibility
might be a web-based quiz game which presented questions one at a
time. You could keep track of a user's score with cookies.
Alternatively, you could keep track of which questions the user had
already seen, so as not to ask the same question twice. You could
even keep track of the user's high score, giving a special message
if and when the user achieves a new high.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164e580.0x17476e0"></a>Using Cookies and Databases</h2></div></div><p>If we were interested in keeping track of multiple values, we
could simply create a number of separate cookies. The cookie
specification indicates that each host or domain can store up to 20
cookies. Except for a note in the CGI.pm documentation indicating
that some versions of Netscape Navigator place a much lower limit
on this number, in practice, storing multiple cookies is easily
possible.</p><p>Just because we can do something does not mean that we should
do it, and using multiple cookies is often the wrong approach to a
problem. Sites interested in keeping track of several variables for
each user have begun to use cookies not to store data about the
user, but rather a unique index into a table stored in a relational
database. (For more information on relational databases and SQL,
see the September, October and November 1997 installments of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>At the Forge</em></span>.)</p><p>How do we do this? First, we create a table in our relational
database that gives a unique identifier (known as a primary key) to
each row in the table. For example, if we want to keep track of
each user's first name and favorite color, we can create a table
using the following statements in SQL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table user_table
   (user_id mediumint auto_increment primary key,
   user_name varchar(60) not null,
   user_color varchar(10) not null);
</pre><p>With the above table created in our database, we can create
an HTML form into which a user enters his or her name and favorite
color (see <a href="2565l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>).
</p><p>Now that we have an HTML form that allows users to submit
their name and favorite color to a CGI program, we need to write
that program, submit-cookie.pl (see
<a href="2565l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>). The program first
checks to see if the user already has a cookie; if so, it simply
updates the existing elements in the user table. A more robust
version of this program would check to see if an entry in the table
really existed or if the cookie value was not valid for our
site.</p><p>If no user_id cookie exists, submit-cookie.pl needs to create
a new entry in the database table and return a new cookie
assignment to the user's browser. We thus insert a new row into the
table whose values depend on the values submitted from the HTML
form. When we have completed sending our SQL query to the server,
we ask the server for the unique ID used when inserting our row,
which serves as a user ID and is stored in the user_id cookie by
the user's browser. We get this value by using the Mysql
<span   class="bold"><b>insert_id</b></span> method, which tells us
exactly this piece of information. Once we have this information,
we create a new cookie and return it as part of the HTTP headers in
the response to the user.</p><p>In either case&mdash;whether we create a row in the table or
update an existing row&mdash;the user is presented with a link to
homepage.pl (see <a href="2565l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a>), a
personalized home page program that displays the information we
have collected. Remember, none of this information is stored in the
cookie on the user's computer. Rather, the information is stored in
a table in our relational database with the index stored in the
user's cookie file.</p><p>Obviously, storing the user's name and favorite color are
just examples. A site could allow users to indicate a set of
preferences and use a database to choose graphics, text and even
hyperlinks based on those preferences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164e580.0x1747c60"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>That's about it for our gentle introduction to cookies and
what they can do for you and your web site. There are a few
elements of cookie creation and administration that I did not go
into, such as expiration dates and security, but those are easily
understood after reading one or more of the specifications
mentioned in Resources. Suffice it to say that anyone interested in
keeping the values of cookies past the current invocation of a
browser must handle expiration dates, since cookies created without
them only last until the user quits the browser.</p><p>As we have seen, cookies provide us with a sense of state
that would otherwise be impossible to manage. It isn't hard to
think of ways in which to use cookies, whether it be in the
creation of personalized home pages, shopping carts for purchasing
items on the Web or determining whether a user has previously
visited a site. With these types of tools, your sites can become
even more interesting for visitors without a lot of extra
work.</p><p><a href="2565s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
