lower prices.</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Bradley Willson</p></li></ul></div><p>This story is proof positive that one has to be careful what
they wish for, because the wish might come true. It all started
when I joked with Marjorie Richardson of <i  >Linux Journal</i> about reviewing a &ldquo;Screamer 500&rdquo;. The next
item in my e-mail was a response stating that Carlie Fairchild had
contacted Microway and had convinced them to send me a machine for
review. My response was, &ldquo;You're kidding, right?&rdquo; Naturally, I
was very pleased to find out it was true. The icing on the cake
came when I called Ann Fried (pronounced &ldquo;freed&rdquo;) at Microway.
She decided it would be better to have me review the new 533MHz
machine instead of the 500MHz model. The idea of having that much
&ldquo;horsepower&rdquo; behind the keyboard brought back memories of my 1970
Mustang and the feeling of being pressed into the seat back under
acceleration. The only things missing were the roar of the engine
and the smell of burnt rubber.</p><p>It is not the intent of this article to compare the Microway
Screamer to other DEC Alpha-based computers. This article is about
the profound differences between Intel 32bit Linux and Alpha 64bit
Linux. I chose the Screamer because of Microway's advertisement in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Their ad provided the most
information about the Alpha. Mainly this article is about having
more fun with a computer than should be legal, while getting a
glimpse of the future of computing.</p><p>As a teenager, I thoroughly enjoyed racing against anyone
that would pull alongside (State Highway Patrol was excluded, of
course). Computers were not of interest to me then. Years passed,
the hot rod was replaced by an econo-box commuter, and I discovered
a new way to race. My first 286 was constantly tweaked to gain
performance, then it was upgraded to a 386 and so on. Now the old
286 case sports an AMD 5x86 133. The green flag drops, the race
between the AMD 133 and the Screamer 533 begins. My hot-rod Mustang
was never a match for a Top-Fuel dragster, and the same is true for
my computer pitted against a 533MHz DEC Alpha, but the fun part was
getting to drive the dragster.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc05978"></a>Let The Race Begin</h2></div></div><p>Vrrrmmm, Vvvrrrrmmm, sputter, sputter, my office box fires up
in DOS. Type linux at the C:\ prompt and Linux boots. I read 66.56
BogoMIPS from the scrolling screen. After I log in and enter
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> I'm ready to go to work.
Next I turn on the Screamer, wait about 4 minutes for the boot
sequence to complete, read 1063.26 BogoMIPS from the startup
messages. Immediately I can see the difference in speed. Parts of
the boot messages are not readable because they scroll by so fast.
I log into the Screamer and enter startx. The XFree86 configuration
messages flash by so fast that they appear as a blur. Literally
everything runs profoundly faster on the Screamer. Emacs appears
within two seconds after menu selection.
<span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span> is ready to use by the time I
move my finger off the mouse button. Both of these applications
take a few seconds to launch on my machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc05b30"></a>A Benchmark Exercise</h2></div></div><p>I needed an application that would level the playing field
and could be timed using &ldquo;time&rdquo; on both machines, so I wrote a
bash script to append several instances of the phrase &ldquo;The quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back&rdquo; to a file (see
<a href="2549l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>). The task was repeated
100,000 times, creating a 5.2MB file on each machine. My 133
churned for 5 minutes and 12.98 seconds before completing the task
(see <a href="2549l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>). The Screamer
completed the execution in a mere 18.89 seconds (see
<a href="2549l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>). I used the 4.9 minutes
I got back from the Alpha to run a few more tests on it.</p><p>Even though it is a crude benchmark test, it exercised the
CPU and the storage hardware of both machines. Several factors like
IDE vs SCSI, memory and running daemons have an effect on the
outcome, so your results will likely vary from these, but you will
be able to gauge your machine's performance to the
Screamer's.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc05d98"></a>Hardware Description</h2></div></div><p>Microway builds an industrial-grade computer, starting with
the case. The all-steel construction shows thoughtful engineering.
Even the drive bay face-plates are made of steel. The side access
panel makes working on the internals easy. Once inside, there is
plenty of room to move around. Adding and removing storage devices
is quick and easy thanks to the rail mount system. There is ample
room between the drives and the motherboard and installed cards so
you won't need a shoe-horn to install or remove a drive. The only
problem I could foresee was that using the lowest two drive bays
requires removal of the rivets that connect the card support rack
to the drive support rack. Once done, it is left up to the user to
provide the means to reconnect the racks. There are five fans to
help the Screamer keep its cool while it crunches data. However,
even with all those blades spinning, the Screamer is a quiet
performer.</p><p>Like many other computers sold today, you can specify the
options you want to buy with the base package, but the &ldquo;basic&rdquo;
Screamer will likely keep any home user flying through code for
years. The Screamer comes in two colors: black and beige. This
particular box was built for the review and a series of trade-shows
with these components: a 4.3GB Seagate Barracuda UW-SCSI
hard-drive, a 1.44MB floppy drive, a 8x IDE Mitsumi CD-ROM, a
Matrox Millennium card with 2MB, an Adaptec 2940 Ultra-Wide SCSI
controller and 128MB of RAM. Of course, it also came with 2MB 9ns
SRAM Cache installed. The motherboard sports 4 PCI slots (2x32bit
and 2x64bit) and 2 ISA slots.</p><p>Microway generously sent a Iiyama 17'' Vision Master model
MF-8617E monitor along with the Screamer. Using this monitor
couldn't be easier. There are four buttons on the front panel and
one of them is the power switch. You activate the on-screen menu
with a single button and make menu selections with either the + or
- buttons. I was impressed with its compact design. I've seen other
monitors of the same display size taking up far more footprint on
the desktop. This model has a maximum resolution of 1600 x 1200
non-interlaced, both 5-BNC and D-Sub mini 15 pin connections and a
maximum of 19 user-definable signal settings. It is also power
management and plug &amp; play (VESA DDC1/2B) aware. At $679.00, it
is a great value.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc05f50"></a>Software Description</h2></div></div><p>Do not expect to find the same robust selection of
applications and utilities for the Screamer as you would for Intel.
The number is small in comparison to Intel-based availability.
There are however, approximately 380 Alpha applications and
utilities to be found at
ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/linux/redhat/redhat-4.2 and
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/linux/ALPHA/alpha. Even with the
relatively low number of available programs, there were several
familiar applications installed on this machine, e.g., xfig, Emacs,
mc, minicum and xfm. Every Alpha program performed faster than the
equivalent Intel program on my machine. The Screamer came with Red
Hat 4.2 (Biltmore release) installed. I tried installing a number
of the Alpha applications from my InfoMagic Developer's Resource
set, circa September 1996. A few failed but the majority of them
worked.</p><p>All is not lost when it comes to running Intel-based
applications on the Alpha platform. Em86 (a non-supported product
of DEC) will run numerous Intel-based applications. Em86 can be run
standalone, in a script or as part of the kernel. It is best to
apply the em86 patch and recompile the kernel, so that it can
recognize the need to emulate when an Intel application is
launched. Otherwise, you have to enter <b  >em86</b>
before every Intel application you wish to run. Furthermore, if the
application spawns a child process, it will fail because em86
(standalone) won't spawn a process to perform emulation for the
child process. With some planning and work, Intel ports can be used
on the Alpha, but not without a performance penalty. Even so, using
an emulator will go a long way toward maintaining operations while
the Alpha ports are in development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc06108"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>From the package truck to the office in 15 minutes&mdash;no speed
limits were broken in the process. The precious cargo was handled
carefully, as the phrase &ldquo;you break it, you buy it&rdquo; repeated in
my head. The setup was like any other computer installation. I
plugged in the keyboard, mouse, monitor and power cords. I flipped
the switches and watched as the fun began. The only problem I had
was making space for the full-size tower under my desk. The extra
monitor on the desktop made for cramped quarters for a few weeks,
but I certainly felt it was worth it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc06210"></a>Tech support</h2></div></div><p>Microway offers telephone tech support at (508) 746-7341 and
e-mail tech support at tech@microway.com and
techsupport@microway.com. The sure-fire way to get answers is to
call. I would like Microway to add an auto-responder to send back a
response that tells the sender that their message got through and
is in the works.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc06318"></a>Company Profile</h2></div></div><p>Microway has been producing advanced mathematical and
scientific computing software products and hardware since 1982.
Today they produce numerous NDP compilers in a variety of
languages, i.e., C/C++, Fortran and Pascal, custom software and
hardware. Their hardware product line reads like a who's who in
industrial computing starting with Intel Pentium Workstations, i860
boards and, of course, the Screamer series of DEC Alpha-based
custom-built file servers and workstations. Companies like Ford
Motor Company, General Motors Corporation, Rolls Royce and Fidelity
Investments pepper Microway's customer database. Microway machines
are installed at hundreds of universities worldwide.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc06420"></a>Company Contact Information</h2></div></div><p>Ann Fried was my sales contact. Mike Brown is the National
Sales Manager. Nina Nitroy was very helpful by making a copy of
<span   class="bold"><b>ldconfig</b></span> available on the ftp
server. I had accidently overwritten the file with the em86
ldconfig. I couldn't shut down the machine without it. They all can
be reached at 508-746-7341.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb0d580.0xc06580"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Microway will have released a new LX motherboard by the time
this reaches the newsstands. It features six PCI slots (2x64bit and
4x32bit), two ISA slots and a 4MB cache. Microway LX motherboards
are unique in the fact that they are backward compatible with
slower but more affordable processors such as the 500MHz and
433MHz. Mike Brown of Microway pointed out that there is a five
percent performance difference between the 500MHz and the 533MHz
chips. Also look for their new NDP FORTRAN for Linux released back
in October.</p></div></div>
