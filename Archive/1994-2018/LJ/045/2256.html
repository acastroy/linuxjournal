combing the Unix job ads in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LA Times</em></span>.
Luckily, this does not mean I am frequently unemployed. In fact, in
addition to my full-time job integrating, supporting and teaching
Unix, I am also a part-time instructor at Rancho Santiago, a
community college in Santa Ana, California. For the first hour of
the first class of every semester, the parking lots are a jungle,
and students are struggling to find the right buildings and
classrooms. I use this hour to discuss the recent Unix job ads and
&ldquo;buzz words&rdquo;. I cover what students will learn in my class and
what additional skills employers list most often in these ads. In
January 97, employers most often wanted Unix plus C programming or
Unix plus Windows NT (networking). Rarely do ads mention a specific
Unix operating system type such as HP, Sun or Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260c580.0x2704660"></a>Unix Like a Car Radio?</h2></div></div><p>I use Linux extensively in my classes. I also use the free
version of SCO Unix. I teach a series of three full-semester Unix
classes available at Rancho:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>CMPR 141: Unix Operating System</p></li><li><p>CMPR 241: Unix System Administration</p></li><li><p>CMPR 242: Advanced Unix Shell Scripts</p></li></ol></div><p>In each of these classes, I give my car radio analogy. There
are many different styles of car radios, each with a slightly
different placement of knobs and controls; yet when most people get
into a strange car, they can turn on the radio, adjust the volume,
change the station and maybe set their favorite stations. In the
same way, Unix on different computer platforms has variations in
the basic commands, e.g., how you log off or how you display a file
one page at a time. There is no need to become disoriented when you
face a strange car radio, oops ... I mean when you face a new
variant of Unix, especially if you are on the Internet, using
TELNET to access one host or another. While Linux has peculiarities
that you don't find on other flavors of Unix, it is not alone.
Every Unix has some peculiarities. For me, the important issue is
that Linux supports all the standard Unix commands and shell
features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260c580.0x2704a28"></a>Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>When I first started teaching at Rancho, my biggest problem
was the fact that students had no access to Unix outside of my
three-hour once-per-week class. The school has a computer lab, but
none of the systems there had access to Unix. I considered several
alternatives before deciding on Linux. There are packages that
allow you to run Unix utilities under MS-DOS. I decided against
using these, because the problems that arose were not really Unix
issues, such as MS-DOS not supporting upper and lower case file
names or Unix permissions. There was another flavor of Unix that
could be loaded from floppy, but that company is no longer in
business. The free version of SCO was not available at the time
and, since it is only a 2-user version, it must be installed at
each station which is difficult in a lab situation.</p><p>I also considered freeBSD. However, I eventually chose to use
Linux in my classroom for the following reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux acts like a standard version of Unix and the
problems that arise are true Unix issues (not MS-DOS
issues).</p></li><li><p>Linux has a large body of documentation and HOWTOs
that allow me to customize the package as needed.</p></li><li><p>Linux licensing allows me to make the software
freely available to students.</p></li><li><p>Linux evolves continuously, supporting new hardware
as it becomes available.</p></li><li><p>Internet ISPs use Linux as e-mail and/or domain
name servers.</p></li><li><p>Linux is strongly represented in the technical book
stores under both the Unix and Internet categories.</p></li><li><p>There are a number of different Linux
distributions, fostering healthy competition and adding
value.</p></li></ul></div><p>All of the above show that Linux is a thriving variant of
Unix, worth studying in its own right, as well as a useful teaching
tool.</p><p>On the other hand, I also warn my students that Linux is not
yet fully accepted as a commercial grade of Unix by all employers.
I also use the free SCO Unix in my classroom so that students can
see variations in Unix side-by-side, and so they can list SCO Unix
as well as Linux in their resumes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260c580.0x2705160"></a>Floppy-Based Linux</h2></div></div><p>For my students, I have created a distribution of Linux which
I call Floppy-Based Linux. It runs completely from floppy and never
accesses the hard disk, yet it supports all the standard Unix
commands and man pages. It can also use TELNET and FTP to access
the Linux server running in the classroom and can print to network
printers in the classroom and the computer lab. Of course, this is
slower than running from hard disk, but it provides a number of
advantages in my environment. My students are often computer
neophytes. I need a bullet-proof environment where they can freely
make mistakes. Thus, I ruled out any distributions that would
require them to load software onto the hard disk, even the UMSDOS
file system. I want my students to be able to work on Unix at home,
at work or in the school computer lab since I believe that
accessing Unix hands-on is essential to learning Unix. At the same
time, I could not take a chance that a mistake on their part might
alter or corrupt their home computer, work computer or lab
computer.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2256f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>My students can run Floppy-Based Linux on any PC with 8MB of
RAM and a 3.5-inch floppy drive. The floppy diskettes are
write-protected when in use, so they cannot be corrupted. The Linux
kernel has been rebuilt, so that it has no drivers for IDE or SCSI
hard disks to ensure that a student cannot alter the hard disk. At
first, I started with the Slackware 3.0 boot diskettes and RAM
disk, but I found that these are not in ELF format so I could not
add some of the commands I wanted. Following the boot disk HOWTO, I
created my own boot diskette and 3MB RAM disk. After loading the
RAM disk, an rc script prompts the student to insert a
&ldquo;Supplement&rdquo; diskette, which loads more files into the root file
system in memory. Students then mount a &ldquo;Utils&rdquo; diskette which
gives them access to many more Unix commands and man pages.</p><p>Students can use Floppy-Based Linux for homework assignments
outside of the classroom. Inside the classroom, there are 18
Windows PCs, one Linux Server and one free SCO Unix system.
Students bring up Floppy-Based Linux on the Windows PCs and then
download new homework assignments from the Linux server using FTP.
They also upload their completed homework to the Linux server. They
can print to a network printer in the classroom. I have also used
variants of Floppy-Based Linux to debug network problems and to
make image backups of a Windows hard-disk partition using
<b  >dd</b> (device-to-device copy) &ldquo;piped&rdquo; to
<b  >rsh</b> (remote shell) to save the data on another
system in the network or its tape drive. (Hard disk access was
enabled in order to do this.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260c580.0x2705528"></a>Electronic Blackboard</h2></div></div><p>I have taught Unix and networking seminars and training
sessions nationwide. There is one teaching technique I use in these
sessions and also in my classroom that I am asked about most
frequently. I call it my &ldquo;electronic blackboard&rdquo;. It allows me to
broadcast everything that appears on my station to all Unix
stations in the room. Students can watch me enter commands,
backspace, make corrections and use command-line editing to develop
long, complicated pipe sequences in gradual steps. Instead of
writing on a blackboard, I use vi to put any notes into a file.
Students see the notes as I type them, as well as how I use vi, and
at the end of class I can print the file as a handout. (It helps
that I am a speedy typist.)</p><p>This broadcasting technique is scalable in that I can
broadcast to one station as easily as to 200 or 500 stations. I can
do this broadcasting using two simple Unix commands that are
available on all flavors of Unix including Linux. No special
software is required. Can you figure out how I do it? Here is the
answer. At my station, I first run this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet localhost | tee /ttt
</pre><p>This gives me a new Unix login. All output and the echo of
everything I type will now be saved in the file
<b  >/ttt</b>. (If you don't have networking set up, you
can do the same thing using <b  >cu</b>, or call up, and
a loop-back cable between two serial ports.)
</p><p>At each of the student stations, run this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /ttt
</pre><p><b  >tail</b> will run until aborted, reading every
new keystroke added to file <b  >/ttt</b> and displaying
it on each student's screen. Now each screen perfectly reproduces
what appears on my screen. I can also automate this by writing a
script to start all the <b  >tail&lt;\!s&gt;-f</b>
commands at one time. Note: each student station must be set up to
use the same TERM variable as I am using at my teaching station,
since escape sequences and graphics will also be broadcast.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260c580.0x27059f8"></a>Advanced Regular Expression Lesson</h2></div></div><p>In closing, I would like to leave you with a lesson that I
teach in advanced regular expressions, which applies to Linux as
well as other flavors of Unix. The rule is: &ldquo;to simplify
line-oriented regular expressions, drop unbounded <span   class="emphasis"><em>or
more</em></span> wild cards.&rdquo; This is analogous to simplifying
unnecessarily complex fractions in mathematics. The simplified
expression is more efficient to implement and easier to understand.
I find that most students understand advanced regular expressions
much better once they understand this rule.</p><p>In regular expressions there are two wild cards that I call
&ldquo;or more&rdquo; wild cards, as shown in these two examples:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grep  'aa*bc'  file
</pre><p>Search for and display any lines in <b  >file</b>
that contain one or more instances of a's, then b, then c.
<pre     class="programlisting">
grep -E 'abc\{10,\}' file
</pre>


Search for and display any lines in file which contain a, then b,
then 10 or more instances of c.
</p><p>Both of these &ldquo;or more&rdquo; wild cards are unbounded, because
the &ldquo;or more&rdquo; wild card occurs either at the start or the end of
the regular expression pattern.</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x260c580.0x26fc5f8"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Contains &ldquo;or
more&rdquo;</b></span></p></td><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Better Pattern</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1. aa*bc</p></td><td><p>abc</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2. abc\{10,\}</p></td><td><p>abc\{10\}</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3. zaa*bc</p></td><td><p>zaa*bc (same)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4. abc\{10,\}$</p></td><td><p>abc\{10,\}$ (same)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In example #1 above, the &ldquo;or more&rdquo; wild card is unbounded,
so leave it out. Searching for <b  >abc</b> is more
efficient and easier to understand than searching for
<b  >aa*bc</b> and results in the same lines being
selected.</p><p>In example #2 above, the &ldquo;or more&rdquo; wild card is again
unbounded, so leave out the comma. To prove that two regular
expression patterns are equivalent, we need to show:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>They do select the same lines. In this case, any
line that contains a then b then 10 or more c's also contains a
then b then 10 c's.</p></li><li><p>They avoid the same lines. In this case, any line
that does not contain a then b then 10 or more c's also does not
contain a then b then 10 c's.</p></li></ol></div><p>In example #3 above, the &ldquo;or more&rdquo; is bounded on both
sides, so you cannot ignore it. Looking for z, then one or more a's
then b then c is different than looking for z then a then b then
c.</p><p>In example #4 above, the &ldquo;or more&rdquo; is bounded on both
sides, so you cannot ignore it. The <b  >$</b> sign
indicates the 10 or more c's must occur at the end of the line,
which is different than looking for exactly 10 c's at the end of
the line.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> command is not
line-oriented, hence this rule does not apply.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed s/aa*bc//g file
</pre><p>This command instructs <b  >sed</b> to delete any
segment in <b  >file</b> that consists of one or more
a's, then b, then c.
</p><p>Command to delete any segment which consists of a then b then
c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sed s/abc//g file
</pre><p>Since sed is not line oriented, do not drop unbounded &ldquo;or
more&rdquo; wild cards.
