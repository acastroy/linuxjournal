    Here's how to get the information you need using GNU's
    hypertext system called info.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2320450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you ever been reading along in a man
page and come across something like, &ldquo;<b  >SEE ALSO gdb entry
in info</b>&rdquo; and wondered what it meant? Still perplexed,
did you pick up <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix Unleashed</em></span> and fail to find one word about
<span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span>? If so, this article is for
you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x23206b8"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span> (information) is the
GNU project's hypertext system filling the gap between the man
pages and printed reference books.
<span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span> is a viewer for info files.
Without going into excruciating detail, info files are rigidly
formatted text files that are processed with the
<span   class="bold"><b>texinfo</b></span> program, and then compiled
by <span   class="bold"><b>makeinfo</b></span>. They end up in gzip
format and usually live in /usr/info/ (at least on Slackware 96).
The info program's job is to uncompress them and present them to
the reader. Info files can also be viewed with Emacs, but this
article will focus only on the stand-alone info program.</p><p>The info files make up a cross-referenced, virtual hierarchy
of documentation. At the top of this hierarchy is the directory
node. If you run info without arguments at your command prompt, the
directory node opens on your console. The directory node serves as
the master index for all info documentation on your computer and
provides a point of entry into all these other files. The files can
also be accessed directly, without going to the directory node
first. For example, I can type <b  >info make</b> at my
prompt and go directly to the documentation for
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span>'s documentation is
divided into nodes&mdash;structures that are basically analogous to
paragraphs. A node can be one short sentence or several screens.
Nodes are physically stored in files. The info program allows both
cross and vertical links between nodes. Once inside info, you can
move from node to node in a random search for data, or you can
quickly find and go to specific information. The documentation's
level of detail increases as you move down the hierarchy tree. At
any given level of detail, you can follow cross references to
related topics at approximately the same level of detail.</p><p>Of course, someone has to write the documentation for it to
be available, and not all Linux software has data available for
info. Most info data deals with gcc, g++, gdb, make and other
topics related to programming and systems administration. In other
words, lots of info documentation exists for older software; this
makes sense as info has been around for a while. Users researching
these areas are fortunate in that they will find a gold mine of
information that's as easy to read as a man page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2320b30"></a>Hands On</h2></div></div><p><a href="2290s1.html" target="_self">Essential GNU Info Reference
Card</a></p><p>At this point, you may wish to look at the Reference Card
and, with these essential commands in mind, try navigating info on
your Linux system. Just enter <b  >info</b> at the prompt
and start reading. I recommend entering <b  >h</b> at the
directory node and working through the on-line tutorial first
thing. The whole course only takes about half an hour. The only
confusing point I found was that info files can only be printed
from within Emacs (the M-x print-node option). Neither the tutorial
nor the info man page makes this clear, but I found it to be
true.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2320d98"></a>New Info Files</h2></div></div><p>What happens when you get a new software package,
<span   class="bold"><b>mgetty</b></span> for instance, that includes
several info files as part of its native documentation? You could
just leave those files where they are and accept the fact that you
would have to run <b  >info mgetty</b> to view them. Or
you could install the new files into the existing hierarchy. You
don't even have to move them to the default info directory.</p><p>First, note the location of the new info files. I'll stick
with mgetty as an example. These files were installed in
/usr/local/info/. In this case, the master info file is named
/usr/local/info/mgetty.info. Master info files always end with the
.info suffix.</p><p>Next, add mgetty's entry to info's directory file. To do
this, edit the file /usr/info/dir as root. Move down to an
appropriate location for the new entry. I chose &ldquo;Miscellaneous
commands and documents&rdquo;, the next to last section. Menu entries in
the dir file consist of three sections. The first is the menu entry
name, starting with an asterisk and followed by a colon. The second
is the menu file name in parentheses, followed by a period. (The
.info suffix isn't needed here, even though it's part of the actual
file name.) The third section is the package description, which
contains the following entry for mgetty:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*mgetty:        (mgetty).       mgetty documentation.
</pre><p>Add this line to the /usr/info/dir file and exit saving the
file. Finally, info has to be able to find mgetty's info files,
since they're not in the default directory, /usr/info/. Although we
could specify (/usr/local/info/mgetty) in our entry's second part,
that would really make the dir file ugly. The most aesthetically
pleasing solution is to set the INFOPATH variable. The directories
in INFOPATH are searched by the info program for data files. So,
add the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export INFOPATH=/usr/info:/usr/local/info
</pre>


to /etc/profile, and on the next login, all users will be able to
access mgetty's info documentation just as if it had always been
part of the hierarchy. If mgetty is ever upgraded&mdash;no
problem&mdash;info finds the new documentation with no further
adjustments.

and page down keys. That would be more intuitive for most people.
Color syntax highlighting might also be a nice touch. Basically,
info works fine just as it is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2228580.0x2321210"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>If you're used to hypertext in the sense of HTML and
Netscape, info may seem spartan by comparison. Indeed, a lot of
documentation these days is in HTML form, and info may quietly fade
away in Netscape's wake. But keep in mind that info's man page was
first copyrighted in 1989&mdash;quite a while before hypertext in the
present sense came about. For an all-ASCII system that's going on
10 years old, it does a pretty darn good job.</p></div></div>
