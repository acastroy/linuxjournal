    This month we learn how to use the Image Window and layers
    in building our images with the GIMP, a Linux power tool for
    the graphics artist.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2531f8.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224f580.0x2347710"></a></h2></div></div><p> Patience and persistence has paid off.
After two articles you sat and wondered &ldquo;When do we get to the
meat?&rdquo; In the first article of this series I introduced the GIMP
and explained some basics about retrieving the program and getting
it running. Last month I took a look at some of the GIMP's windows
and and described the image file formats it supports. We're now
ready to start looking at how you can use the GIMP. I'll start by
looking at where images are displayed and manipulated: the Image
Window.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224f580.0x2347818"></a>The Image Window</h2></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows an Image Window along with the Layers and
Channels dialog. The visible parts of the Image Window consist of
the Image display area, the rulers across the top and left sides
and the scrollbars across the bottom and right sides. Pop down
menus and the Ruler Guides are not visible by default but are easy
to access.</p><p><a href="2531f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Image
Window with Dialog Box</b></span></a></p><p>By default, if the Image Window's dimensions fit into the
displayed screen area, the rulers are divided by units of 10 pixels
with major tick marks at intervals of 100 pixels. There are two
other sizes of tick marks, those for units of 20 pixels and those
for units of 10 pixels. If the Image Window's dimensions are larger
than the displayable screen area, the GIMP will provide a window
that uses major tick marks at units of 250 pixels. However, since
the image would actually be larger than the screen, the Image
Window does not display the image pixels one per display pixel.
Don't let this confuse you. You can zoom in on your image to get
pixel-level details. The GIMP is just smart enough to know how to
handle images that are too big for the display. This capability is
useful for design work destined for print media.</p><p>The units represented by the tick marks in the rulers can be
specified in the gimprc file (which was covered in the first
article in this series). By default the units are in pixels, but
this can be changed to inches or centimeters at the user's
discretion.</p><p>Guides are straight dashed lines alternating red and black.
These extend from the left to right edges of the Image Window's
display area or from the top to the bottom of the display area. To
create a new Guide, move the cursor over a ruler (top or left
side), hold down the left mouse button and drag into the display
area. A new Guide, parallel to the ruler from which you dragged the
cursor, is created. When the cursor is over the Guide, it changes
to a left-hand pointer (a hand with the index finger extended).
Hold down the left mouse button to grab the Guide and move it to a
new location. To remove the Guide, grab it and drag it back over
the ruler and release the mouse button.</p><p><a href="2531f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Two
Guides</b></span></a></p><p>Figure 2 shows two Guides, one horizontal and one vertical.
Guides are useful for aligning objects or for snapping selections
to specific areas. You can toggle selections to snap to the Guides
from the Image Window's pop-down menu
(&ldquo;View<b  >-&gt;</b>Snap&rdquo; To Guides). Guides, although
visible in the Image Window, are not saved to files of any image
type except XCF. If you save a file to GIF or JPEG or TIFF for
example, the Guides will not show up in the image file.</p><p>The scrollbars perform just as scrollbars in any other
windowing application. Grab the slider with the left mouse button
held down to slide the image up/down or left/right. Click in the
scrollbar outside of the slider (if the slider does not extend the
length of the scrollbar) to page through the display area. Click on
the arrow buttons on the ends of the scrollbar to increment or
decrement your way through the display area.</p><p>The most important features of the Image Window are the
pop-down menus. From these you will have access to all of the
GIMP's image processing capabilities. To post (i.e., display and
leave open) the menus, place the cursor over the display area and
click the right mouse button once. The top level menu will open and
stay open until you either click outside the menu windows or select
a menu option. Some of the options open submenus, which will also
stay open if you simply click on those options. Clicking/dragging
over the menus also works, although the menus will close if you
drag the mouse off the menus and release the mouse button.</p><p>The Image Window's pop-down menus are divided into the
following categories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>File Menu</b></span>: new,
open, close (window), quit (completely), etc.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Edit Menu</b></span>: copy,
cut, paste, clear, stroke, etc.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select Menu</b></span>: all
selection methods, including growing, feathering and shrinking
selections</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>View Menu</b></span>: zoom
in/out, toggle rulers/guides, etc.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Image Menu</b></span>:
invert, color balance/contrast/adjust, convert to/from
RBG/Grayscale/Indexed, etc.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Layers Menu</b></span>:
functions applicable to the currently active layer.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tools Menu</b></span>: access
to all the tools available from the Toolbox.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Filters Menu</b></span>: the
large set of image filters such as blurring, embossing, bump
mapping and many more.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dialogs Menu</b></span>:
provides a convenient way to open the various dialogs such as the
Gradient Editor, the Layers and Channels dialog, the color palette
and the brushes dialog.</p></li></ul></div><p>Descriptions of all of these would be far more than I can fit
into one series of articles. I will cover some of the more
interesting filters in next month's article and will provide a
detailed description of the Toolbox. Most icons accessible from the
Toolbox are also accessible from Image Window menus, and those that
aren't are modifiable through Image Window menu options.</p><p>The rest of the menu options each have fairly obvious
meanings. The File Menu options are nothing special, although you
may want to take a look at the Preferences... option. Selecting
this option opens a window which provides the user with access to
configuring the way transparency is represented in layers and in
the gradient editor. These changes are for the current session only
and are not saved across invocations of the GIMP. You must manually
edit the gimprc file to make permanent changes to these
preferences.</p><p>An interesting option under the Edit Menu is the Stroke
option, available after a selection is made. I'll discuss
selections more in a moment, but for now, note that there are many
ways to select portions of your images in the GIMP, and each method
is a form of a selection. A selection is denoted by a dashed line
around the edge of the selection that appears to move around that
edge and is known as &ldquo;marching ants&rdquo;. The selection outline can
be used to draw a line along that edge by using the Stroke option.
The color of the line must be chosen after the selection is made,
and you should also select the appropriate brush. Once that is
done, just select &ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Stroke&rdquo; and a line
in the selected color will be drawn using the selected brush. I
know, I know&mdash;&ldquo;How do you choose the color?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How do you choose
the brush?&rdquo; That's next month&mdash;there's just so much to
cover.</p><p>You will find that one of the most important operations you
will use with the GIMP is that of selecting portions of the image
for modification. There are rectangular, ellipse, free-hand, fuzzy
and bezier selection tools available from the Toolbox. The Image
Window's Select Menu offers other methods such as all, none and
select by color. This last method is one I use quite often to
accurately select regions of irregularly shaped (but uniformly
colored) areas of an image. I can then keep that selection, add a
new transparent layer and fill the selection with a gradient in the
new layer. Selections can be made in any layer. The selection
doesn't actually affect particular pixels. They just mark a region
of the image. Because of this, you can change which layer you are
working on after you've made a selection and then work with the
same selected region in another layer. This will allow changes to
the new layer within the selected region and leave the old layer,
where the selection was originally made, unchanged.</p><p>The GIMP is an image processing tool. It works by
manipulating images based on the color, distribution, frequency and
other aspects of the pixels which make up those images. I haven't
talked before this about the sorts of manipulations that can be
done. A great majority of them are done through the use of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Filters</em></span>, also known as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Plug-Ins</em></span>. This is a large area of discussion
and better suited to the last article in this series, however not
all image manipulation is done through Filters. The Image Menu in
the Image Window's menu allows users to do a number of image
processing tasks on an image and/or its layers. Most of the image
processing tasks here relate to the general color, brightness or
tint to an image as a whole and worry less about how individual
pixels relate to their neighbors.</p><p>The Image Menu also allows transforming the image type from
RGB (generally known as high color, 24-bit images) to Indexed
(256-color images) to Grayscale (black and white) images. If you
find you want to change a color image to black and white, but leave
it as an RGB image (so you can add color to it later), you can use
the
&ldquo;Image<b  >-&gt;</b>Adjust<b  >-&gt;</b>Desaturate&rdquo;
option. You can also adjust the amount of Red, Green or Blue in an
image using the
&ldquo;Image<b  >-&gt;</b>Adjust<b  >-&gt;</b>Curves&rdquo;
option. I've often used the Curves and
&ldquo;Image<b  >-&gt;</b>Adjust<b  >-&gt;</b>Color
Balance&rdquo; option in conjunction with the Chrome Script-Fu script to
add or enhance color to the edges of text logos. The latest version
of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> logo was created in part
using this technique.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224f580.0x233f5a0"></a>Layers</h2></div></div><p>I just got through mentioning the use of layers in
conjunction with selections. Layers are like transparencies used
for overhead projectors, with the ones on top mixing with layers
below to produce the final image. Each layer can be added,
subtracted, multiplied, screened, overlayed and have any of a
number of other processes applied to it with respect to the layers
below it. By default, a new image has one layer&mdash;the Background
layer. The default for this layer is to be solid white, but it is
possible to change this based on the background color and
transparency settings.</p><p>Layers are accessed via the Layers and Channels dialog box.
This dialog is opened from the
&ldquo;Dialog<b  >-&gt;</b>Layers and Channels&rdquo; menu option
from the pop down menus in the Image Window. Figure 3 shows a
sample of the dialog in use. Inside the dialog there are a number
of features: an image selection menu, the Close button and a
notebook with tabs for choosing either the Layers or the Channels
feature. In the Layers page of the notebook there is a menu for
selecting the Mode to apply to this layer (such as add, subtract,
darken, etc.). It's also possible to apply a uniform transparency
level to the current layer using the Opacity slider.</p><p><a href="2531f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Layers and Channels Dialog Box</b></span></a></p><p>Below the slider there is a window which shows each of the
layers for the current image specified in the Image Menu (which is
located at the top of the Layers and Channels Dialog). Each layer
displayed contains four default fields: visibility, move anchor, a
thumbnail preview of the layer and the layer's name. A grayscale
mask field is not displayed by default, but can be created by
selecting the Add Layer Mask option from the Layer Menu. This menu
is opened by clicking the left mouse button over the name of the
current layer and is used for all layer specific functions except
transparency and mode selection. Double clicking on the layer's
name will bring up the Edit Layer Attributes dialog in which you
can specify a new name for the layer. Get into the habit of setting
the names of layers often, since many of your images may have many
small layers; finding the one you want simply by looking at the
thumbnail may not be easy. In most cases, changes to an image
affect only the currently active layer. The active layer is the
highlighted one in the list of layers. On most systems this is a
blue highlight, although it's possible this might be some other
color on very low-end systems with limited color displays.</p><p>A few things to note. First, changing the name of a layer
will add an Alpha channel to the layer. There are lots of special
tricks you can do with Alpha channels that are beyond the scope of
this series, but you should be aware that the Background layer, by
default and before you have changed its layer name, has no Alpha
channel. Also, the size of the thumbnails can be set to just about
any size via an option in the gimprc file. As was mentioned in the
first article, you should eventually become familiar with the
gimprc file, if you find the default settings are not to your
liking. You'll be surprised at how much you can configure in the
GIMP.</p><p>The visibility icon, an eyeball, is used to turn the layer on
or off. If the layer is off, its effects on the visible image in
the Image Window are removed. Clicking on the field containing the
eyeball will toggle the visibility of the layer. When the
visibility is off, the eyeball will not be displayed. The
visibility icon will be in the far left side of the currently
selected layer, directly beneath the &ldquo;Opacity&rdquo; text in the Layers
and Channels dialog. If you don't see the eyeball there, click the
left mouse button in that area and the eyeball will appear. This
may or may not affect the visible image in the Image Window,
depending on the contents of that layer and the Mode currently
selected.</p><p>Often it is useful to move more than one layer at a time,
i.e., as a group. By default using the Move Tool (in the Toolbox)
will affect only the current layer. Clicking on the second field
for a layer, the move anchor will set that layer to move along with
any other layers which also have their move anchor set. When the
move anchor is set, a <span   class="emphasis"><em>fleur</em></span> icon is displayed.
A fleur consists of two double ended arrows, perpendicular to each
other. Although actions on an image specifically affect the
currently active layer, any layer with its fleur displayed will
also be moved when the Move Tool is used on the current
layer.</p><p>Moving a layer can take a little practice. Some layers, due
to the use of transparency, are harder to grab than others because
very little of the non-transparent region is actually visible.
Other layers, higher in the stacking order, may obscure most of a
lower layer. When moving a layer you will find it easiest to first
select the Move Tool from the Toolbox. Next, move the cursor over a
region in the Image Window that you suspect is part of the layer
you wish to move. The cursor should change to the fleur symbol when
you are over that region. If you then click on that spot and
discover the layer selection has changed to another layer, then
stop. Press <b  >ctrl-Z</b> to undo any moves you've
made, if any. (If you accidently undo something you didn't want to,
just use &ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Redo&rdquo; in the Image Window
menus or <b  >ctrl-R</b> to get it back.) Now turn off
the visibility of the higher level layers until the layer you want
to move is the highest visible layer. You should now have a better
chance to grabbing just the layer you want. If you still have
problems, you can turn off the visibility of all the layers, higher
and lower levels. Again, all of this takes a little
practice.</p><p>The list of layers is shown with the topmost layer at the top
of the list and the bottom layer, the background layer, at the
bottom. When the layers are combined, also know as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>composited</em></span>, they are combined from bottom to
top. So the bottom layer defines the start of the image's initial
appearance before the other layers are combined with it. The Image
Window will display the image based on which layers are currently
visible. The compositing is done by the GIMP in a way that is
invisible to the user except for changes made to the Mode or
visibility of a layer. Since the layers are processed from bottom
to top, the order of the layers is important. Layers can be raised
or lowered using the Layers Menu. The Layers Menu is opened by
clicking the left mouse button over the name of a layer. Selecting
an option in the Layers Menu only affects the layer over which the
menu was opened.</p><p>The size of the preview in the Layers and Channels dialog can
be set in the gimprc file. Smaller preview sizes do not really
speed up processing but do require less memory and allow more
layers to be displayed simultaneously. Layers themselves are not
constrained to the same size, although when producing the final
image, a constraint of some kind will be applied to all layers. The
constraint used depends on the way the final image is produced from
the layers.</p><p>Layers provide tremendous flexibility in producing images in
the GIMP, but they can cause a little confusion when first starting
out. It is important to note the following about layers when saving
or loading images:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>New images have a single, white background
layer.</p></li><li><p>Opening an existing file in any format except XCF
will load the image into the background layer. You cannot open an
image into a layer of an existing Image Window. If you want to do
this, you need to open the image in a new window, select the entire
image (<b  >ctrl-A</b> in the Image Window), copy it
(&ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Copy&rdquo;) and then paste it
(&ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Paste&rdquo;) into the existing Image
Window.</p></li><li><p>Saving an image in any format except XCF will save
only the currently active layer. If there is more than one layer
and you want to save the image visible in the Image Window to GIF,
JPEG or some other format, you should first flatten the layers and
then save the image.</p></li><li><p>Saving an image with layers using the XCF format
will save the image while preserving all the layer
information.</p></li></ul></div><p>The XCF format is the native file format for the GIMP and you
should save all work in progress in this format. This format will
necessarily produce very large files, much larger than the other
file formats available. When you are done working on an image and
ready to produce the final image into one of the many image file
formats supported, you need to <span   class="emphasis"><em>merge all the visible
layers</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>flatten</em></span> the image. The
latter process will remove transparency layers (after processing
them) and constrain the final image to the visible size of the
image. The former is similar, but preserves transparency and can be
constrained to the actual image size, the size of the bottom layer
or can be expanded as needed.</p><p>Flattening an image takes all the layers and combines them in
a way that matches what you can see visually in the Image Window.
Merging the layers can expand the image to encompass non-visible
portions of some layers. In most cases, I've found flattening works
better for my work. Merging can leave unwanted transparent regions
that get translated to black or other colors in GIF or JPEG images.
This doesn't mean there aren't any uses for merging, but initially,
you'll probably find flattening works best.</p><p>There are actually two kinds of layers: normal and floating.
A floating layer is a temporary layer that holds a pasted selection
prior to applying it to either a new layer or anchoring it in the
currently active layer. Floating layers have a few limitations due
to their transient nature. Just be certain to convert the floating
layer to either a new layer or anchor it by using the appropriate
selection from the Layers Menu. Anchoring a floating layer causes
it to be composited with the currently active layer or layer
mask.</p><p>A layer mask is a tool for constraining which parts of a
layer should be used in the composited image. This is best shown
with a simple example. Let's start with a background layer with a
simple gradient applied (Figure 4). Next, add a new layer (via the
Layers Menu&mdash;click over the layer name with the left mouse button)
and apply a different gradient. Then, add the layer mask by opening
the Layers Menu and selecting Add Layer Mask. Make the layer mask
fully transparent by selecting the Black toggle in the Add Mask
Options dialog box. Make sure the new layer is the active layer by
clicking on its preview image. The image state should look similar
to Figure 5.</p><p><a href="2531f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Background Layer Plus Gradient</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2531f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Background Plus Two Gradient Layers</b></span></a></p><p>Now open a new image, a TIFF file that is a black and white
image of a leaf (Figure 6). The leaf is white with a black
background so that it will allow the current layer to show up in
the interior of the leaf (the white areas) and allow the rest of
the image to be transparent (allowing the first gradient to show
through). Then select the entire leaf's image using
&ldquo;Select<b  >-&gt;</b>By Color&rdquo; and copy it to the clip
buffer using the Image Windows menus
(&ldquo;Edit<b  >-&gt;</b>Copy&rdquo;). Paste that into the
gradient layer and anchor it. The pasted image becomes part of the
layers mask.</p><p><a href="2531f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6. Leaf
Image</b></span></a></p><p>Note that you can set whether a floating layer is anchored to
the main layer image or to the layer mask by clicking on the
preview images in the Layers and Channels dialog. The outline of
the preview image is highlighted to show which part of the layer
will be used to anchor the pasted image.</p><p>Now the image has two layers, with two different gradients
applied. The top layers gradient only shows up where the leaf's
mask is white. Figure 7 shows the final image with the Layers and
Channels dialog.</p><p><a href="2531f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7. Final
Image</b></span></a></p><p>You can turn the layers mask on and off by holding down the
control (ctrl) key while clicking the left mouse button in the
masks preview image for the active layer. Alternatively, you can
view just the mask by holding down the alt key and left-button
clicking in the masks preview image. In the former case, visibility
turned off creates a red border around the layers mask preview. In
the latter case, visibility of the actual layer creates a green
border. I don't use this feature much yet, but it's nice to know it
exists.</p><p>The Layers Menu provides an Apply Layer Mask option which
will composite the mask with the layer, if accepted. The same
option provides the ability to discard the layers mask, in which
case the mask is removed and no longer affects the layer or the
composited image. You will need to apply the layer mask if you wish
to use some filters or effects from the Image options in the Image
Window menus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224f580.0x2340990"></a>A Quick Look At Filters</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP is designed around the concept of external programs
which handle much of the detailed work of the application, such as
file I/O and image processing. The latter are commonly referred to
as image filters since they filter the pixels in an image to
produce an interesting effect.</p><p>To access the filters you use the Image Window's pop-down
menu. The top level of this menu holds the Filters submenu. Under
this submenu you will find an array of options including such
categories as Artistic, Blur, Edge Detect, Render and many others.
Each category has one or more filters associated with it.</p><p>Filters can operate on an image without any further user
input, but most require the setting of variable parameters. When
the filter is selected the GIMP launches the external program and
opens a communications path to it. The plug-in filter then requests
a dialog box with any number of buttons, menus, sliders or other
window features. Each of the configurable items in the dialog has a
default value so the user can simply accept the defaults and have
the filter process the image. Many of the filters provide preview
windows to give the user an idea of how the image will look after
the filter is applied based on the configuration the user has
selected. Since some processing can potentially take quite a bit of
time to complete, some filters allow the preview to be turned
off.</p><p>It is impossible to discuss the breadth and detail of the
available filters in this one article. I plan on writing some tips
for using these filters in the future, either to be presented in
the &ldquo;Graphics Muse&rdquo; column in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Gazette</em></span> or on my GIMP web pages. In the meantime, I'll
just mention a few of my favorites.</p><p>The IFS Compose plug-in is a nifty little tool for creating
fractal images. Fractals have been around for some time and many
people have grown a little tired of the same old Mandelbrot sets,
but this is different. The fractals are actually a set of three
Serpinski triangles that can be rotated, scaled, stretched and
colored. The transformation of each of these can, when done
properly, create some very realistic looking foliage or very
artistic backdrops. A nice feature of this plug-in is that it keeps
track of its settings between invocations.</p><p>The Cubism and Mosaic Plug-Ins
(&ldquo;Filters<b  >-&gt;</b>Artistic<b  >-&gt;</b>Cubism&rdquo;
and
&ldquo;Filters<b  >-&gt;</b>Artistic<b  >-&gt;</b>Mosaic&rdquo;)
offer some unusual effects. The Mosaic plug-in can produce images
that appear as though they have been tiled using square and
randomly edged 3D tiles. Cubism applies rectangular patches using
the colors of the current layer and user-defined sizes and
distributions. You can think of Cubism as &ldquo;applying rectangular
order&rdquo; to a layer. Use of Cubism will cause a layer to be changed
drastically so you might wish to duplicate a layer before applying
this filter.</p><p>The Whirl and Pinch Filter
(&ldquo;Filters<b  >-&gt;</b>Distorts<b  >-&gt;</b>Whirl
and Pinch&rdquo;) creates swirled patterns on the selected area or
layer, much like having the image as the surface of a liquid in
which you swirl your finger. The amount of swirl or pinch can be
user defined, and a preview of the effect is available from the
filters dialog window.</p><p>The SuperNova Filter

creates a bright sun-like section in the current layer. The Sun has
spokes extending out from the center. The color and radius of the
sun, the number of spokes, and the position of the sun within the

Toolbox in its entirety, explaining what each icon is and how it is
