of the Open Group's Common Desktop Environment (CDE). CDE provides
a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the X Window System. As such,
it shares some of the functionality offered by other window
managers such as Feeble Virtual Window Manger (FVWM). A key
difference between CDE and the others is that many of the leading
Unix vendors provide a CDE package for their own native platform
(AIX, Solaris, et al.) This means that users in a heterogeneous
Unix environment need learn only one GUI, regardless of the
underlying platform.</p><p>CDE's GUI is centered around a movable toolbar, which sits at
the bottom of each of four workspaces. A workspace occupies one
full screen and you can navigate between workspaces by clicking on
a workspace panner, which is located in the center of the toolbar.
CDE also features drag and drop functionality along with tear off
menus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d69d0"></a>What's Included?</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat's Client Edition comes with a short Install booklet,
a 300 page Advanced User's and System Administrator's Guide and a
CD-ROM. The CD-ROM contains both software and lots of additional
documentation. The User's Guide is well written with an elegance on
par with Kernighan and Ritchie's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The C Programming
Language</em></span>.</p><p>The Open Group bundles several new applications with CDE. Of
these new applications, I use
<span   class="bold"><b>dtterm</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dtpad</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>dtfile</b></span> the most.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>dtterm</b></span> is meant to replace
xterm and incorporates most of the functionality of xterm, adding a
handy menu bar that allows you to cut, paste and set options.
<span   class="bold"><b>dtpad</b></span> reminds me of Microsoft's
Notepad. It uses <b  >ctrl-c</b>,
<b  >ctrl-v</b> and <b  >Ctrl-x</b> as hot keys
to copy, paste and delete. If you spend any time using Windows, you
should feel comfortable using dtpad.
<span   class="bold"><b>dtfile</b></span> is a file manager that
supports drag and drop as well as the normal options found in most
file managers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d6ef8"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Running a simple script allowed me to perfectly install CDE
over Red Hat Linux. But, CDE balked after I tried to slam-dunk
(ignore all documentation, start the install script and press the
enter key at each prompt) it over Slackware Linux. I'll take the
blame for that failure, but it points out that you should carefully
read the installation booklet if you install on a platform other
than Red Hat.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d7000"></a>Room for Improvement</h2></div></div><p>In a CDE environment dtlogin replaces the command-line login.
You enter your user ID with a password, and away you go&mdash;unless you
are trying to login as root. In that case dtlogin denies the login.
(See below for a workaround.) Red Hat needs to improve their
install script to create a proper environment for root
logins.</p><p>One other tiny improvement that Red Hat could make is to glue
the User's Guide CD-ROM holder right side up. Somebody glued mine
in upside-down.</p><p>The Open Group provides a generic login script, which causes
some confusion in the Linux community. CDE sources a file named
$HOME/.dtprofile to set up its environment. A comment at the bottom
of .dtprofile implies that you can also source $HOME/.profile by
setting <b  >DTSOURCEPROFILE=true</b>, but that only
works if you happen to use sh or csh as your shell. Unfortunately,
most Linux distributions use bash, a shell that also sources
$HOME/.profile.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d7210"></a>Workaround for the root dtlogin Problem</h2></div></div><p>The easiest way to handle this problem, especially on a
stand-alone system, is to use Linux's virtual console. Most Linux
distributions create four or more virtual consoles during the
install process.</p><p>The only trick to using virtual consoles is knowing how to
jump to them. To jump to the first virtual console, you press
<b  >alt-F1</b>. To jump to the second you press
<b  >alt-F2</b> and so on. <b  >alt &lt;-</b>
or <b  >alt -&gt;</b> cycles you through all of the
consoles and displays, so to return to the CDE display you need to
keep pressing one of those two combinations. With high resolution
monitors, CDE requires a few seconds after you jump to it before it
fires up. As you cycle through the screens, you can detect the CDE
display because it's the only one that's blank&mdash;the remaining
screens display a command-line prompt.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d74d0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>If you administer a heterogeneous Unix environment, it's a
good bet that CDE can make your life easier by standardizing an X
environment across all platforms. CDE also helps programmers
develop and deploy cross-platform X applications with a minimum of
fuss.</p><p>As a developer, CDE's four workspaces help me reduce clutter
on my display. During a typical development session I'll open a
terminal process in one workspace, use Netscape Navigator in a
second workspace, use <span   class="bold"><b>ghostview</b></span> in
a third and use <span   class="bold"><b>xxgdb</b></span> in the
fourth.</p><p>I am very happy with my purchase. Red Hat delivers a solid
product with good documentation that is well worth the purchase
price of $79.95US plus shipping. Red Hat also sells a Developer's
Edition for $199.00US. If you enjoy a nice GUI, you too will like
CDE. CDE lends a lot of credibility to Linux as a production
environment.</p></div></div>
