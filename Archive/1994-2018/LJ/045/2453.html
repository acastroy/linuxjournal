    This article describes the SESAME Security Architecture and
    how it can be used to secure your networked applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208b920"></a></h2></div></div><p>Security is becoming increasingly
important for Intranet and Internet applications. We hear almost
daily of new security incidents on the Internet, sites being
penetrated or sensitive data being captured by attackers. There are
a number of solutions that together can secure your network.
</p><p>The first is a firewall with the aim being to control access
between networks. Typically they are used at a site's Internet
connection to control who can get in and out between the site's
internal network and the Internet. In some intranets, firewalls are
also used to control access within the network.</p><p>However, firewalls are not the end of the solution. Firewalls
do not protect applications behind the firewall from internal
attack or secure applications that need to communicate through the
firewall. We require a method to secure applications; the client
and server portions of an application need to verify each other's
identity (authentication), and data being transferred across
networks must be protected from unauthorised viewing
(confidentiality protected) or modification (integrity
protected).</p><p>We have recently ported SESAME to Linux, and it provides a
wonderful tool for anyone who needs to secure their applications on
Linux. SESAME is also available on a range of other Unix platforms,
so your Linux systems will be able to work with these, too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208bb30"></a>Kerberos</h2></div></div><p>The SESAME Security Architecture is an extension of Kerberos,
arguably the most famous and most successful architecture to date
for securing networks (http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/index.html).
Kerberos was developed at MIT, starting around 1985 as part of
project Athena. Kerberos was designed to be a network
authentication service. It also provides confidentiality and
integrity services to data during transit.</p><p>Kerberos works using a trusted third-party model. That is,
somewhere on the network a Kerberos Authentication Server exists
which can verify the identity of the client and server and provide
proof to the other party of that authentication. Authentication is
actually achieved by the client (acting on behalf of a user) and
the server providing proof to the Kerberos Authentication Server
that they know a DES cryptographic key (the user and server share
their DES cryptographic key with the Kerberos Authentication
Server).</p><p>Kerberos is very successful if industry acceptance is any
guide. It is now being used widely for securing networks, although
in many cases you may not realize you are actually using it. For
example, Kerberos is built into a number of operating systems
providing security to the rtools and NFS on Linux and Solaris, and
it is being used as the basis of the cryptographic library on
Windows NT. It is also part of a number of firewall
implementations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208bce8"></a>So What's Wrong With Kerberos?</h2></div></div><p>Kerberos was designed for a closed Intranet environment,
where the users and applications are managed by one administration.
Although Kerberos is a good security architecture for such an
isolated network, it has problems scaling to a large
inter-networked environment (e.g., the Internet). Kerberos has two
main problems that limit its scalability: the use of DES
cryptographic keys for authentication and the lack of a user
privileges (authorization) service.</p><p>The lack of scalability through the use of DES cryptographic
keys for authentication is known as a key management problem. For
authentication to be possible between client or server and the
Kerberos Authentication Server in such an arrangement, the system
administrator needs to generate a DES cryptographic key and share
it securely with the two parties involved. In a small network with
a single group of system administrators it is a feasible solution,
but in a large inter-network, securely sharing keys is
difficult.</p><p>Kerberos also lacks an authorization service. When a client
application working on behalf of a user connects to the server, the
server needs to know the privileges of the user. Kerberos depends
on the fact that the user's privileges are already stored on the
server computer. For example, the user has an account on the
server, or the user's privileges are known to the server
application. This arrangement is not scalable, because in a large
inter-network it is certainly not possible for every server
computer to be configured with every possible user's privileges. We
require another method for the server to gather the user's
privileges.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208bea0"></a>SESAME</h2></div></div><p>SESAME is the Secure European System For Applications in a
Multi-Vendor Environment
(http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/cosic/sesame.html). Some people
call it the European equivalent of Kerberos, but in reality it is a
much improved security architecture. SESAME provides the complete
authentication service of Kerberos, including confidentiality and
integrity during transit, and adds to it an authorization service
and public key cryptography. Both additions allow SESAME to be much
more scalable to a large networked environment than Kerberos. It
also adds an excellent auditing system and provides a privilege
delegation scheme.</p><p>SESAME was also designed to be completely platform
independent. It uses a role-based, access-control model that allows
SESAME to easily interoperate with many operating systems.</p><p>SESAME development began around 1990 by ICL, Bull and Siemens
Nixdorf, with the current release SESAME Version 4 (which is the
version we have made available for Linux).</p><p>SESAME has an Authentication Server similar to Kerberos, but
adds to it a Privilege Attribute Server. The idea here is that a
user can not only be authenticated, but also provided with
privileges, which can be presented to the server when required.
This allows a user to access a server that has no knowledge of a
user but is able to verify the privileges provided. SESAME also
allows authentication based on public key technologies (as well as
the standard Kerberos DES cryptographic key method).</p><p>SESAME is also gaining industry acceptance. The ICL Access
Manager (http://www.icl.co.uk/access/) and ISM Access Master
(http://www.ism.bull.net/) are commercial products based on SESAME.
These products are being used to secure large Internet wide
networks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208c108"></a>Securing Applications With SESAME</h2></div></div><p>SESAME provides the Generic Security Services Application
Programmer Interface (GSSAPI), which is a library of security
routines. The aim of the library is to provide a standard method to
secure client/server networked applications, and the GSSAPI is now
an Internet Standard (RFC1508). Our experience with the GSSAPI is
that it is small enough to be easily understood (only about 20
routines), although it takes some time to understand all of the
possibilities of each routine. The GSSAPI is becoming increasingly
popular for securing applications, and the SESAME version of the
GSSAPI provides the full implementation.</p><p>Figure 1 shows some segments of GSSAPI code. In the code
segment, the client is authenticated to the server and data is
protected during transit. The segment highlights the fact that it
only takes a dozen or so extra lines of code in your client and
server application to secure them (other than variable
declarations). In the code segment only the client is
authenticated, although with a few extra lines of code the server
could also be authenticated to the client.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2453f1.large.jpg"><img src="2453f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. GSSAPI Code Representation
</p></div></div><p>To secure your client/server applications, you insert the
GSSAPI library calls at the appropriate points in your code and
then rebuild the application. In a very short time it may be
possible to convert an insecure application into a secure one,
depending on how well structured your application is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208c478"></a>SESAME and Linux</h2></div></div><p>SESAME is already available on a range of platforms: AIX 3.2
on Bull DPX 20, SINIX (Unix SVR4) on SNI MX300i, Unix SVR4 on ICL
DRS6000 and AIX 3.2 on IBM RS6000. We have spent around 12 months
porting SESAME to Linux. The main problems were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The SESAME source made numerous assumptions about
the Unix environment on which it was being built. These include
absolute paths in scripts for Unix programs, assuming that the root
home directory was / (in our case it was /root) and so on.</p></li><li><p>The documentation was quite extensive but still did
not make it easy to build and configure the system. The order of
information was not always logical, and in some sections was far
too brief.</p></li><li><p>The code had a number of memory bugs. These include
over-running array bounds and memory leakages.</p></li></ul></div><p>After securing a number of applications, we are happy with
the stability of our Linux version of SESAME. It is already being
used here in Australia, in Europe and in North America. We have
written comprehensive building, installation and configuration
guides and have a number of reports available to help you get
SESAME working on your networks
(http://www.fit.qut.edu.au/~ashley/sesame.html).</p><p>To get SESAME working, you first download the source from the
European web site (listed in the beginning of the SESAME section)
and then download our Linux patches to modify the source and build
SESAME for you (we have automated it down to a one line execution).
After this you follow our installation and configuration guides,
which describe how to start the SESAME Security Servers, how to
setup accounts for users and how to create the cryptographic keys
that will be used for your security. New administrators of SESAME
will probably take about two days to get SESAME working and
understand what they are doing.</p><p>We are also working on building a library of SESAMIZED
applications for Linux. In cooperation with other SESAME
developers, we have concentrated on producing a SESAMIZED TELNET,
FTP, rtools and NFS. This development is ongoing with the aim of
providing a comprehensive suite of applications for Linux
networks.</p><p>We have concentrated on Red Hat Linux for our port. There was
no particular reason for using this version of Linux other than we
are using it for related work. The first version of the port was
completed on Red Hat Version 3.0.3, although lately we have it
working on Red Hat Version 4.1. We have also tried SESAME on
Slackware Linux and it worked without any modification.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208c948"></a>To Sum Up</h2></div></div><p>SESAME is an advanced, scalable network security
architecture. SESAME's GSSAPI allows you to quickly secure your
client/server applications. It provides all of the services of
Kerberos, with the added advantage of being scalable as your
network grows. SESAME is now available for Linux, together with
comprehensive documentation, and a comprehensive suite of SESAMIZED
applications for Linux is under development.</p><p><a href="2453s1.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f93580.0x208cb00"></a>Special Thanks</h2></div></div><p>We would like to thank Shaw Innes and Mark Rutherford for
their considerable efforts in chasing and fixing problems in the
Linux port.</p></div></div>
