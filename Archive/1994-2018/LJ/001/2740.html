    In this initial column, I'll explore porting programs from other Un*x
    versions to Linux. Porting Un*x applications to Linux is best done,
    as a general rule, by porting the application to some standard which
    Linux follows. This way, not only will Linux users benefit from your
    port, but so will users of other operating systems which follow the
    same standards. As always, there are some exceptions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212f580.0x22272f0"></a>Broad Hints</h2></div></div><p>When you write a new application, trying to make as much of
the application as possible follow the POSIX standard will
generally provide the highest level of portability. If an
application &ldquo;tracks,&rdquo; or follows the rules of, POSIX, it will
compile without changes on almost every known version and clone of
Un*x, and on Windows NT, OS/2 2.x, and recent versions of VMS, as
well. If some system-dependent code must be written, it can be
isolated and clearly marked, making it possible for the next person
who ports the application to a new platform to port it much more
easily. And programmers on non-POSIX-compliant platforms will
probably know their platforms limitations, and know what to do to
port your application to their platform.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current version of the POSIX standard is
showing its age a little. To make a sufficiently powerful
application, you generally need to use a more powerful standard, on
which defines facilities missing in POSIX. In general, if your
program compiles under System V (often referred to as SYSV) or BSD
systems, it will probably compile without change under Linux.
System V compatibility is enabled default in Linux, and I will show
later in this article how to enable BSD compatibility. In general,
the Linux libraries, combined with GCC, provide one of the easiest
platforms available to port to. In fact, the greatest challenge in
writing applications on Linux is to not use all the facilities
available on Linux. To do so would make it difficult to port the
application to other platforms, even though it would make the
application easier to write originally for Linux, because many of
these rich facilities are not available on other platforms. Some
say that Linux is a better platform to port to than to port
from.</p><p>For the future, a specification called &ldquo;Spec 1170&rdquo; is being
written, and all operating systems will have to follow it to be
called &ldquo;UNIXtm&rdquo;. It is more powerful that most previous un*x
specifications&mdash;powerful enough that common applications will not
have to violate it to get real work done and will be widely
followed, as most Un*x vendors have already pledged to support it.
Spec1170 is being developed by X/Open, developers of the current
XPG3 specification. Linux will eventually comply with most, if not
all, of Spec 1170, but the developers will not commit to it without
seeing the final standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212f580.0x22274a8"></a>Specific Issues</h2></div></div><p>There are essentially three areas in Linux which cause
problems porting, two of which are not avoidable, and the other of
which it would be undesirable to avoid.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212f580.0x22275b0"></a>Conflicting standards</h2></div></div><p>In most cases, it has been possible to make library functions
compatible with both SYSV and BSD, but in some cases, standards
simply conflict. When this happens, the POSIX behavior is chosen,
if POSIX defines it. (If POSIX does not define it, the most
reasonable behavior is chosen, or some other standard behavior is
used.) For instance, the behavior of signals has changed from one
version of unix to another.</p><p>Signals in early versions of un*x were unreliable. Whenever a
signal was called, the signal handler was uninstalled, and so the
first thing that most signal handlers did was reinstall themselves,
leading to code like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void sigfoo_handler(int foo) {
    signal(SIGFOO, sigfoo_handler); /* Rest of signal handler */
}
</pre><p>However, if another <b  >SIGFOO</b> signal was
received after the signal handler had been scheduled to run, and
before <b  >signal()</b> had been called, the default
behavior for the signal would happen (perhaps it was just ignored,
or perhaps the program was terminated, depending on the signal), or
if the new signal was received before the signal handler has
returned, the signal could be lost completely. Later, reliable
signals were introduced to solve these problems, but SYSV and BSD
took different routes.</p><p>BSD introduced a <b  >sigaction()</b> function to
replace the old <b  >signal()</b> function, and then
re-implemented <b  >signal()</b> in terms of
<b  >sigaction()</b>, but changed the semantics of
<b  >signal()</b> so that a signal handler installed with
the <b  >signal()</b> function stays installed. SYSV kept
the old version of signal() which uninstalls itself, and introduced
a whole mess of different functions for dealing with reliable
signals. POSIX uses sigaction(). Linux follows POSIX, but can
provide BSD signals if the BSD environment is selected, as
described below.</p><p>Terminal handling also varies, and BSD terminal handling is
significantly different from SYSV and POSIX, although SYSV and
POSIX terminal handling are similar enough that both interfaces are
easily provided by Linux by using the same mechanism in the kernel.
The SYSV scheme is known as <b  >termio</b>, and the
POSIX scheme is known as <b  >termio</b>. The older BSD
scheme is known as <b  >sgtty</b>. When porting a BSD
application, you may notice compiler warnings and errors referring
to sgtty.h, <b  >TIOCGETP</b>,
<b  >TIOCSETP</b>, <b  >TIOCFLUSH</b>,
<b  >RAW</b>, and other similar things.</p><p>To compile applications written specifically for the BSD
platform, simply compile with the
<b  >-I/usr/include/bsd</b> flag, and link the
application with the <b  >-lbsd</b> flag. This makes BSD
terminal handling <b  >ioctl()</b>'s work, and makes
<b  >signal()</b> install the reliable signals that
&ldquo;recent&rdquo; BSD code expects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212f580.0x2227f50"></a>System Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>Some code simply requires functionality that isn't defined by
any standard, or at least any sufficiently popular one, and is
therefore written separately for each operating system. An example
of this is finding the current load average or other indication of
system load. For most implementations of Un*x, this requires that a
process have superuser powers, and that it go looking in special
places in kernel memory for magic numbers. Exactly where to look in
the kernel memory (usually <b  >/dev/kmem</b>) is
determined by the derivation of the source code&mdash;SYSV code looks in
one place, and BSD code looks in another. On other operating
systems, many various methods are used.</p><p>In Linux, the load average can be obtained by any process by
simply reading the file <b  >/proc/loadavg</b>--you can
see it yourself at the command line by typing <b  >cat
/proc/loadavg</b>. Fortunately, this and many other special
features like it are standard across all installations of Linux and
fairly easy to use.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a few problems you may run into that
are not quite as tractable. The formats of some files, such as
/etc/utmp, are not all well-defined under Linux. That is to say,
standards do exist, but they appear to be interpreted differently
on different platforms. This situation will hopefully improve over
time, but right now, it appears to be difficult to write code which
works on all Linux installations.</p><p>For now, I recommend having a reasonably standard Linux
distribution yourself, and making your software work on your own
computer, and then ask that users who have problems using your
software contact you. Work it out for each individual case when
they do, perhaps using <b  >#ifdef</b>'s, so that when
you release a new copy of your software, it will work on more Linux
installations. It will also allow your software to work on more
non-Linux platforms. I also suggest getting the Linux Documentation
Project man pages, which include man pages defining these formats
if they did not come with your Linux distribution. Follow them in
the best way you can, pointing out to the authors where and why
they are not clear, and help re-write them if necessary to clarify
them. With your help, these small problems can be resolved, in
time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212f580.0x22282c0"></a>Non-Broken Behavior</h2></div></div><p>In some cases, source code written on other operating systems
makes assumptions that are true on the original operating system,
but which are not true under Linux because some functionality has
been fixed. An example is <b  >select()</b>. When
<b  >select()</b> was first introduced, it was pointed
out in the man page that the <span   class="emphasis"><em>time</em></span> parameter,
which was passed to select by reference (&amp;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>time</em></span>), was not currently modified, but that in
the future it might be modified to return the time remaining in the
select. Programmers either never noticed or completely ignored this
advice, and now that several operating systems, including Linux, do
modify the time parameter, programs which depended on it not being
modified are breaking.</p><p>As a result, at regular intervals (about once a month, I
think), someone posts to the newsgroup
<b  >comp.os.linux.misc</b>, saying: &ldquo;The Linux
<b  >select()</b> call is broken!&rdquo; even though the Linux
manual pages and the Linux GCC FAQ carefully explain the situation.
Operating systems keep being improved, but one thing never changes:
some people will alway refuse to read the documentation.....</p><p>Some code blindly assumes that signals like SIGBUS and SIGEMT
are defined, even though there is no guarantee (under POSIX) that
these signals will exist on a platform. This type of code is easily
fixed&mdash;simply wrap code referring to the offending signal in
<b  >#ifdef SIGNAME</b>, so that it is only included on
operating systems that define that signal. Alternately, you can
re-define the signals to <b  >SIGUNUSED</b>, by adding
<b  >-DSIGFOO=SIGUNUSED</b> to the CFLAGS line in the
Makefile.</p><p>Many programmers have ignored warnings not to make any
assumptions about the FILE structure, and have dereferenced members
of the FILE structure at will. Ignoring for the moment the argument
that the original standard I/O should have included macros or
functions to access those members, this causes problems under
Linux, because standard I/O under Linux is based on C++ iostream
library, and therefore has completely different structure members.
As an example, while porting GNU Emacs 19.xx to Linux, I found that
emacs wants to know how many characters are left in the stdio
buffering, and the default behavior was to look at
<b  >(FILE)-&gt;_ptr - (FILE)-&lt;_base</b>, which don't
exist under Linux. Fortunately, this was done with a macro which is
defined in the Emacs source, called
<b  >PENDING\_OUTPUT\_COUNT</b>, which I was able to
define in the Linux-specific <b  >file linux.h</b> as
<b  >(FILE)-&gt;\_pptr - (FILE)-&gt;\_pbase</b>.</p><p>Also, it appears that the standard libraries of many
operating systems define a symbol called sys_siglist, but do not
declare it. Since it is declared in the Linux header files, you
simply need to comment out any extra declaration of
<b  >sys_siglist</b> in the source for the program. This
is true of several other features as well:
<b  >sys_siglistis</b> only an example.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212f580.0x2228a50"></a>A Case Study</h2></div></div><p>I thought that I would find a sample program to port as an
example for this column, but over a weekend, as I downloaded
program after program, I was just more and more impressed with the
Linux C library as program after program compiled with simple
tweaks like changing the Makefile to use gcc instead of cc and
changing paths to executables. I finally found a program that might
give some people problems porting, an editor called Freyja.</p><p>I copied the supplied makefile.unx to Makefile, and edited
the Makefile. I changed CFLAGS to -O2 to use the highest level of
optimization from GCC, and typed make at the command line. GCC
complained that <b  >TIOCGETP</b>,
<b  >TIOCSETP</b>, and <b  >RAW</b> were
undefined. This means that Freyja is written with BSD in mind.
There did not appear to be any #define's that I could make to
change Freyja's behavior to SYSV or POSIX, either.</p><p>So, following the steps in the GCC-FAQ, I added
<b  >-I/usr/include/bsd</b> to the CFLAGS line, and
<b  >-lbsd</b> to the link line (called FXLINK in Freyja
for some strange reason; it's usually called LDFLAGS), and ran make
again.</p><p>That was <span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span> that was
required to &ldquo;port&rdquo; this bsd-oriented program. I had to read the
documentation to find out that I needed to call it with the
arguments &ldquo;-kT -s29&rdquo; to tell it how to write to the screen and read
from the keyboard, or that I needed to compile an equivalent change
into the resource file that Freyja uses, but it was very
simple.</p><p>Freyja is written by Craig A. Finseth, and is available via
ftp from <b  >mail.unet.umn.edu</b>, or if you don't have
ftp access, via U.S. mail. Quoting the README:</p><p>Diskette: Send the author blank diskettes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>3 1/2" (1.44 MB), or</p></li><li><p>3 1/2" (720 KB)</p></li></ul></div><p>and a SASE or enough stamps to cover return postage plus a
dollar or so (so that I can buy a diskette mailer). Or you can just
send me about US\$5.00 in check, stamp, whatever and I will furnish
the diskette(s) and mailer. Non-US people can send me four 1.44 MB
3 1/2" diskettes in lieu of money. (More money is always nice, but
please don't feel obligated in any way.)
