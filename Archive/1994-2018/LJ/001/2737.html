    We continue to see database applications being developed in
    fourth generation languages (4GLs), and we continue to see
    more and more sophisticated (and expensive) 4GLs. Onyx is on
    the other end of the spectrum, offering a 4GL that takes
    advantage of the tools built into the operating environment
    under which it runs. This effort also shows that it is
    possible to earn a living working with free software.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1d580.0x1b153a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Onyx is a tool for rapid prototyping of
database applications. The theory behind Onyx is that any
application consists of the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Internal tables to store temporary data</p></li><li><p>Masks to view and edit the date</p></li><li><p>Transactions between the internal tables and the
rest of the world</p></li></ul></div><p>Transactions can be bound to a menu, an input field, a function key
or to the change of the current row of the cursor. So if the user
selects a menu item or leaves an input field by pressing return the
transaction will automatically be started.
</p><p>Unlike other 4GLs, Onyx doesn't hide your environment
(UNIX/Linux) but gives you the full functionality of the shell. For
example, this is how we could print letters using data in an Onyx
table combined with the capabilities of shell commands.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export table to pipe {
        awk | mailmerge | groff -Tps -mm | lpr -Pps; }
</pre><p>It is also possible to import a table using shell commands as
in the example below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
import table from pipe {
        tar xvf /dev/rmt0 | sed "s/ *-&gt; */-&gt;/" | sed "s/  */     /g"
        | sed "s/[^]*$/&amp;  &amp;/"; }
</pre><p>And, of course, it is possible to export or import to an SQL
statement.</p><p>Onyx needs a SQL database which is doing the real work. So
its possible to use a SQL anywhere in your Net. I'm normally using
Informix on a Sparc II or Ingres at home under Linux.</p><p>Databases are named as
<b  >database%engine@host.domain</b>. Supported engines
are currently GNU-Awk, Informix, Ingres and SHQL.</p><p>The last one (SHQL) is a genius shell-hack which is parsing
the SQL by the shell and doing the job by awk. Of course that's
really slow. It is included because that is where my idea for the
Onyx project came from. Also, you need SHQL because it is used to
manage the schema definition (create table, etc) for gawk.</p><p><a href="2737l1.html" target="_self">Current System</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1d580.0x1b15b30"></a>Why did I write Onyx?</h2></div></div><p>I started looking at Linux in late 91 and since MCC 95c+ I've
thown away Xenix and am using Linux at home. As TCP/IP got into
98p1 kernel I thought about using Linux as a client for
databases.</p><p>In winter 92 I began a project for the &rdquo;Wasserwirtschaftsamt
Bremen&ldquo; called &rdquo;Verwaltung von Anlagen mit Wassergefaehrdenden
Stoffen&ldquo;. They had a Siemens MX 500 which was so slow that it was
possible to roll a cigarette and smoke it to the end when somebody
wants to do a query.</p><p>I told them that &rdquo;Client/Server computing is the only
solution" and they installed my suggested hardware consisting of a
Sparc II and 8 PCs. Having Linux in mind I gave the PCs 8 MB of RAM
and a Tseng video card. This was the right idea as I saw
later.</p><p>Informix SE and NET for the Sparc were delivered together
with Informix for MS-DOS. The port of the old database and program
was only a job of character conversation between DIN to MS-DOS. (In
Germany we always have a umlaute problem.)</p><p>The hardware was installed as described above. It was fast
enough to do the querys in just a second. Unfortunately, the MS-DOS
systems were crashing nearly every hour! We didn't know if it's
MS-DOS, PC-NFS, or Informix that was causing the problem. But we
knew it was the time to look for a stable operating system. Of
course Linux was my choice!</p><p>As an interim measure, the MS-DOS systems were used as
terminals to telnet into the Sparc and jobs where run on the Sparc.
The query times grew to up to half a minute and and I started to
hack a better solution using Linux.</p><p>Two month later I installed the first version with Linux
99p6. It's now running 99p9. And I now have earned enough money
(6,000 DM) to live for the next two years and I'm now rewriting
this quick hack that I did in the first month. As there are some
more Wasserwirtschaftsaemter (administration of installations with
water endangering substances) for the Department of the Environment
of the State of Bremen having interest in the program, I will
continue the project earning more money and giving the Onyx-4GL to
the Internet community. Onyx a killer application for Linux? Large
databases are a place where the money is made. So let's talk about
money. As I saw it, MS-DOS is bad choice as a possible platform for
a database clients. I see two possible solutions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use a Mainframe for doing the job</p></li><li><p>Use Sparc or $CO Unix systems as clients</p></li></ul></div><p>Both are really expensive choices. With Linux you only need a
cheap PC to do the job in client/server computing and you don't
have to pay a lot of money to a Unix vendor for every
client.</p><p>Another possible scenario is needing to upsize an entry-level
database from an MS-DOS platform. Let's think about the following
configuration</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First a 486-bases system with Linux and
[university] Ingres as a server</p></li><li><p>If there are old 286 systems they can be used as
terminals</p></li><li><p>Newer 86 can be upgraded to run the client
locally</p></li><li><p>As the database is growing up you can use a faster
(commercial) SQL on a commercial Unix as a server without
trouble</p></li><li><p>DOS applications can be run by QuarterDeck
DeskView-X without the posibilty of crashing the database in an
xterm on any Linux box, if</p></li><li><p>DOS applications are really necessary</p></li></ul></div><p>Such a configuration can be sold to any company and it cost
less than a Novell Netware. And if the company has several
locations in perhaps different cities its possible to mirror the
transactions on normal modem lines which is impossible to do with a
traditional database over a remote Novell FS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1d580.0x1b16580"></a>Future Plans</h2></div></div><p>As I've written above I'm now rewriting the whole program,
and I hope to finish this in December. Look at the Usenet group
comp.os.linux.announce for my posting.</p><p>The new version will include the following features :</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Rewritten by using an Object Oriented Parser
Generator</p></li><li><p>Include awk &amp; ingres as local servers for
Linux</p></li><li><p>Backup store and forward as a model for distributed
transactions</p></li><li><p>Some example applications</p></li><li><p>Hopefully some documentation (Real programmers
don't write docs, they write programs. The code was hard to write
it should be hard to read.) But, I've expanded the parser generator
to produce manual pages for each parser it produces. That's a
start.</p></li><li><p>I'm considering adding a RFC on my transaction
monitor so I can find out what features should be added to the rd
version</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a1d580.0x1b16b58"></a>Where to get it?</h2></div></div><p>If you are in Germany, Onyx can be found on the ftp sites
wowbagger.pc-labor.uni-bremen.de or olis.north.de. Onyx has also
been posted to alt.sources on Usenet. Otherwise, your best bet is
to use archive to locate a copy.</p></div></div>
