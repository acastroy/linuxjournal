appears many of the preferred programs work optimally under a Unix
environment. Since most scientists lack a Sun SPARCstation at home
(some may), or even at work, it seems that Linux offers the ability
to easily bring that sort of computer power to the home. I've seen
that some of the molecular biology utilities have been ported to
Linux. Some of the examples are:
</p><p>ACaDB (A Caenorhabditis elegans Data Base) -nematode database
for this evolved:</p><p>AAtDB (An Arabidopsis thaliana Data Base) -Plant database and
other similar databases are evelving to serve as databases to
accumulate information on these model biological systems.</p><p>GDE (Genetic Design Environment) An X-windows based working
environment to run molecular-biology based applications. It allows
for the easy entry and visualization of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) or
amino acids (protein) sequences. It further allows analysis of
these sequences by programs such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>FASTA - sequence alignment algorithm to compare
sequences to a database</p></li><li><p>BLASTA - similar sequence analysis but by a
different algorithm</p></li></ul></div><p>If a local database (like GenBank) is not available on a
Linux system, GDE is designed to format an e-mail submission in the
proper format to one of the national databanks available on the
Internet.</p><p>PHYLIP - phylogeny analysis programs and others wihch may
easily be linked to GDE.</p><p>I'm not sure if many others have been ported to Linux, but it
seems quite feasible. I see new Unix versions of useful programs
being offered and often wonder if anyone has ported them to Linux.
The <i  >Linux Journal</i> should be able to facilitate learning of this
information. I feel Linux brings the most in easily obtainable
computing power to the scientific workbench.Gerard R. Lazo,Southern

DOS/Windows and OS/2, our programming tips column, our FSF column
and even our interview with Linus. Guess we are on the right
track.</b></span><span   class="bold"><b>Editor</b></span></p><p>Good day!</p><p>I'm highly enthusiastic about the existence of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
Since I started using Linux in February of 1993, I find my current
magazine subscription is becoming totally irrelevant, since the
editors are violent MS-DOS/Windows bigots.</p><p>About the software wanted column</p><p>This would be useful. What do people want for linux, in the
way of software, additional drivers, and so on. It should be
possible for a person's e-mail or actual address to be printed with
their suggestions so people can either point out possible software,
or ask about details so they can implement it.</p><p>About the New Linux-related products column</p><p>Definitely. For me, the major point of subscribing to a
magazine is for the reviews, and for tutorials. I also love opinion
pieces.</p><p>Andrew suggests the following additions to <i  >LJ</i></p><p>Alpha and beta software: Not reviews, but at least mentions
of it. &ldquo;Andrew Kuchling's FOOGOL compiler is currently in early
beta. Word-of-mouth says it's not bad, although some of FOOGOL's
more complex constructs produce buggy code at this point.&rdquo; This is
so people know what's on the way, and so corporate types can see
that Linux is alive and well.</p><p>Also, keep us up to date on what's going on in other software
areas, like the DOS/Windows and commercial Unix worlds. We don't
want a 6-page review of Windows 4.0, but simply mention new
programs that we should know about, and the reaction to them. (Was
it buggy? Is Windows finally usable? Can Wine be rewritten to run
4.0's programs?) The same applies to new Unix versions; have they
got any new ideas we can apply to Linux? Did they encounter any
pitfalls?</p><p>Another feature might be &ldquo;The Cutting Edge&rdquo;, on using Linux
in new and experimental ways. For example, to simulate a parallel
processing system in software; as a server for a database; running
it on a Pentium; using Linux as a cheap firewall system;
object-oriented databases for Linux; using a Linux network to test
networking hardware (according to Paul Tomblin, this is what
Gandalf does). This is to show that Linux makes inexpensive
PC-compatibles competitive with pricy workstations for demanding
Unix applications. <i  >LJ</i> should also show how Linux/X is better than
DOS/Windows, capable of running everyday applications like word
processors &amp; spreadsheets.</p><p><i  >LJ</i> should not exclusively discuss things from the viewpoint
of a beginning user. We also need more advanced articles on system
administration, and programming topics (not necessarily
Linux-specific ones). Some possibilities I'd personally like to see
are:</p><p>Optimizing: What does gcc do when optimization is turned on?
How can I write code that will optimize well?</p><p>Using PC-specific features in Unix: How can I play a
digitized sound in my own programs? Display VGA graphics? Play an
MPEG? Read a mouse?</p><p>Tweaking XF86 for better performance: How can I make it use
less memory? What graphics cards are really fast?</p><p>Backing up your system: How to do it onto floppies? What tape
devices are good?</p><p>Kernel patches: What's available? How well does it
work?</p><p>SCSI: How do I go about moving from IDE to SCSI? Which cards
and peripherals are good?</p><p>Adding your own system call to the kernel: What do you
do?</p><p>Texture mapping in graphics programming: This is not a
Linux-specific topic, but could be given with Linux-specific
examples.</p><p>Most of these topics are too big for one article, and some
partially duplicate FAQs. That's to be expected; articles should
never (well, almost never) say &ldquo;See the XYZ FAQ for the details&rdquo;.
If they're not giving the details, what's the point of the article?
(On the other hand, articles should be written for various levels
of expertise; some obscure details should be referred to FAQs,
then.)</p><p>A longer-term idea: It should be possible for writers to
include a demo program, possibly a complex one. For example, the
texture mapping author might provide an svgalib program that lets
the users change colours, and experiment with different noise
functions on the fly. The software could be available via mail
server or FTP; people without Internet access could order a
diskette with the software from <i  >LJ</i>. (This would be a large effort,
though, and so should be postponed; maybe you could politely tell
non-Internet readers that they're out of luck. :) ) This software
may not be significant enough for it to be put on tsx-11 or
sunsite, so <i  >LJ</i> should handle this itself. (Or convince tsx-11 to
add a <i  >LJ</i>/software directory.)</p><p>Also, it's _very_ important to have book reviews. A possible
yearly feature might be &ldquo;The Linux Bookshelf&rdquo;, a listing and
discussion of the best books for using and programming Linux (and
Unix, more generally); both reference books and tutorial books
should be covered, and both Linux Documentation Project efforts and
third-party publishers. It would also be valuable to review Linux
Doc. Project works as they're released (with allowances, when
they're in alpha).</p><p>It's very important to also print negative reviews (possibly
unsigned, to avoid chilling friendships). Some magazines (such as
Compute!) didn't print negative reviews, saying they'd rather use
the space to discuss a good program or book, but I think that's
wrong. Otherwise, if product X isn't reviewed, is it because the
reviewers hated it, or because the magazine has never seen it?
There's no need to be cruel, especially in reviewing free products.
(Our expectations are higher for commercial software, and people
often write free software in their spare time.) But we should know
that foo0.99 compiles out of the box and works wonderfully, while
bar0.99 requires lots of config hacking and seems a bit unstable
once it's running. Reviews are really the most important factor to
me; if <i  >LJ</i>'s reviews section is perfunctory, then the magazine's
usefulness is greatly impaired.</p><p>Another point: There's so much free software around, and it's
updated so quickly that reviewing it all would be an impossible
task. But a half page of 1-5 line mentions of especially notable or
dangerously unstable software would be nice...</p><p>admscr0.01.tgz: A system administration script with menus. Be
careful; the &ldquo;Clean Man Pages&rdquo; option may destroy man pages for
which you have no source. admscr0.50.tgz: A system administration
script with menus. Small, but it works nicely.</p><p>In short, be negative about things from time to time. Don't
hesitate to say &ldquo;This software is bad.&rdquo;, or &ldquo;386BSD is better than
Linux in the following areas...&rdquo; If we don't talk about what's
wrong, things will never get fixed.Andrew Kuchling
