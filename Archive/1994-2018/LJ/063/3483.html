yet another book for the newcomer to Linux. The layout of the book
is just like others in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Idiot's</em></span> series, so
if you have read one of the others, this one will seem familiar.
I've personally never understood why a company would choose to
insult their customers by calling them &ldquo;idiots&rdquo; or &ldquo;dummies&rdquo;,
but it seems to work&mdash;this is a popular series. I also found the
graphics a bit cutesy, but then again, whatever works. The book's
format makes for easy reading, and needed information is easy to
locate.
</p><p>This book takes a unique approach by covering the use of
Linux with a graphical desktop, namely KDE. This should make Linux
seem a bit more palatable to users migrating from Windows or
Macintosh environments. It is advertised as being for the beginning
to intermediate user&mdash;I'd say just the beginning user. The
information is good, but so basic the intermediate user will
already know it. An example of one such simplistic bit of
information is the statement &ldquo;icons are buttons too&rdquo;.</p><p>The distribution covered is Caldera OpenLinux v1.3, which is
on the CD-ROM included with the book. Installation is relegated to
Appendix A, so you read the Appendices first, then move on to Part
1, Chapter 1, which describes the KDE desktop. Installation, in
fact everything in the book, is given a step-by-step approach that
should be easy even for the complete computer beginner. Information
is comprehensive and presented in a clear, concise manner.</p><p>The author points out that while KDE looks much like MS
Windows and Macintosh desktops, quite a few differences exist. He
then goes on to describe KDE, letting you discover the differences
on your own. Using KDE certainly makes Linux more accessible to the
GUI aficionado. KDE looks good and works well. It provides
drop-down menus, buttons, tool bars, dialog boxes&mdash;all the things
one expects of a good graphical user interface. Reading through
Part 1, I kept asking myself, &ldquo;where's the prompt?&rdquo; I didn't find
out until Chapter 11.</p><p>Basic file organization and management through the GUI is
fully discussed. Changing file permissions and groups can be done
by clicking on a button&mdash;no more time spent figuring out the right
value to give the <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> command.
Instructions are also given for reading and writing files to floppy
disk.</p><p>Chapter 8 talks about accessing the network. Again, it is
done with step-by-step instructions for everything from configuring
the modem to setting up dial-up service to your ISP. All forms of
communication, e.g., web, e-mail and FTP, are discussed at their
most basic levels. After reading these chapters, you will know what
these services are and how to use them&mdash;exactly what you, as a
newbie, need to know.</p><p>In Part 2, I finally found my introduction to the shell.
Here, the most basic commands, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>, are discussed, along with
those options considered useful by the author. When discussing file
commands, the proper warning about running commands as root is
given. The text editors covered are
<span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Xemacs</b></span>.</p><p>Part 3 deals with necessary system tasks, including user
management and backups. Since the covered system is Caldera,
Chapter 21 deals with LISA, the Linux Installation and System
Administration utility. There are also chapters on installing
applications using the Red Hat Package Manager (jointly developed
with Caldera), customizing your kernel using LISA, and configuring
Apache. By the time you've learned how to do all the tasks
described in these final chapters, you can upgrade your standing
from newbie to intermediate.</p><p>Mr. Ricart has written a very good book for the newcomer to
Linux, giving the reader the basics without going deeply into
technical details. He has been working with UNIX for many years and
with Linux since 1996. He knows his stuff.</p></div></div>
