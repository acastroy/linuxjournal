    A description of an archaeology project making use of the
    freely available geographic information system GRASS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adfc38"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since the days of Heinrich Schliemann's
search for Troy, archaeologists have been confronted with the
dilemma of how to record the spatial characteristics of
archaeological data, and once recorded, how to analyze those data.
This spatial information has historically been recorded on paper
maps of varying accuracy and scales. When researchers wanted to
perform analyses of these data, they were required to spend hours,
if not days, transposing this information to new paper maps and
making arduous measurements by hand. This time-consuming process is
nearing its end as researchers have moved to take advantage of
geographic information systems (GIS) for spatial analysis. A GIS is
best thought of as a dynamic database for spatial data. Fortunately
for budget- and quality-conscious researchers, one of the oldest
and most robust GIS packages, GRASS, is available for free on
Linux.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2983f5.jpg"></div>

</p><p>In the late 1970s, the method of storing archaeological data
began to slowly change from paper to digital. As access to
affordable computers became more common, archaeologists could see
the advantages of digitally storing their spatial data for
analysis. During this era, several commercial vendors began to
develop primitive GIS systems in an attempt to meet the needs of
researchers for storing spatial data. Unfortunately, these products
worked only with vector data, completely ignoring the utility of
raster data for analysis. The Construction Engineering Research
Laboratory (CERL) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found this
oversight in the commercial packages too great and decided the
solution was to build their own UNIX-based GIS which would meld
vector and raster analysis capabilities. Because this code was
written with federal dollars, it was made freely available to the
public. From this project, the GIS package Geographical Resource
Analysis Support System, more commonly known by the acronym
&ldquo;GRASS&rdquo;, was born. From its beginnings in 1982, GRASS has grown
into a powerful GIS package that rivals expensive commercial
packages, yet remains free to the public.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1adfea0"></a>The Project</h2></div></div><p>The McGregor Guided Missile Range, located on Ft. Bliss in
western Texas and southern New Mexico, is just a bit smaller than
the state of Delaware. As part of the army's long-standing
commitment to effective management and research, Ft. Bliss hired
the Archaeological Research Center (ARC) at the University of
Texas-El Paso to do a 100% pedestrian survey of 180 square
kilometers of the McGregor Range. Principal Investigator Tim Church
and Ft. Bliss Lead Archaeologist Galen Burget realized that
utilizing old-fashioned survey methods, which are primarily
paper-based, would not be feasible for a survey of this size.
Furthermore, the research team was keenly interested in utilizing
spatial environmental and ecological information collected by other
scientists at the post for a landscape analysis.</p><p>Archaeologists/computer jockeys Trevor Kludt and R. Joe
Brandon were hired to help develop the most efficient method of
dealing with the anticipated high volume of data, and to insure
this data would be compatible with existing ecological data. R. Joe
also directed the archaeological field crew during the project to
monitor the feasibility of the data acquisition methodologies being
developed. This hands-on approach allowed Trevor and R. Joe to
tweak the methodology for collecting data so that all aspects of
the project were integrated seamlessly.</p><p>The research team decided from the outset that a flexible and
powerful GIS package was critical if we were to accomplish our
goals. Considering that virtually no money was in the budget for
additional hardware or software and the whole show would have to be
run on a single mid-level Pentium PC (Gateway P-133 with 2GB hard
disk and 32MB memory), we were in a bind. After considering a
number of commercial GIS packages, we determined that GRASS running
under Linux was the answer. GRASS offered the full suite of
sophisticated GIS functions this project demanded, while Linux
provided us with a wide range of tools to tackle the myriad
customizations we knew were inevitable. Once the decision was made,
we had Linux (Red Hat 4.0) up and running in no time, then
downloaded the compiled binaries of GRASS (v4.2). This was all done
for about what the field crews would spend on refreshments after a
day surveying in the desert heat.</p><p>Knowing from the outset that our field data were to be
integrated with raster (cell)-based environmental and ecological
data, the research team decided to develop a raster-based field
methodology for the survey. At first blush, this decision seemed
very practical. In practice, it turned out to be the biggest
challenge of the project. Traditional field methods focus primarily
on defining the boundaries of archaeological concentrations (sites)
and are therefore vector-based. The methods we were developing,
focusing on the distribution of materials within the grid units or
&ldquo;cells&rdquo;, were raster-based. How could we put these individual
raster units together to define our sites?</p><p>For speed, flexibility and consistency, we decided to develop
computer routines to do this monotonous work for us. As we needed
these routines quickly, initial prototyping was done using Qbasic
while Linux and GRASS were being set up. Eventually, we translated
these routines into a comprehensive Tcl script suite and a number
of Bash shell scripts. These scripts allowed us to automate the
importation of the field-collected data, dynamically define site
boundaries, provide reports on site inventories, import data into
GRASS, run a suite of spatial tests and comparisons, and output the
finished site and project maps. Without the power and stability of
Linux and the interoperability of GRASS, these tasks would have
taken a significant amount of time.</p><p><a href="2983f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Single Survey Unit Results</b></span></a></p><p>Fieldwork proceeded rapidly. Each of the 180 square kilometer
survey areas was divided into a grid of 16m2 &ldquo;cells&rdquo; which
matched the size of the analysis raster cells within GRASS. Figure
1 shows the results of a single km2 survey unit, displaying
artifact distribution, site boundaries and a 100-meter grid. The
site boundaries were created using the GRASS module
<span   class="bold"><b>r.to.vect</b></span>. The map output was
created in a script file that can be sent to the screen or the
printer. The size of the cells, 16m on a side, was a trade-off
between the desire for precision (smaller units) and efficiency
(larger units). Field crews would traverse these survey areas using
1:3,000-scale aerial photographs with the 16m2 grid superimposed on
the photo. The detail of these air photos allowed the crew chief to
navigate to near sub-meter precision quickly and consistently. As
the crews walked through the survey areas, crew members would call
out when they had spotted an artifact or feature, and the crew
chief would then call back the corresponding row and column number
for that &ldquo;cell&rdquo;. This information was then noted on a data
recording form. In the lab, this information was checked for
accuracy and errors, entered into a DOS-based data file (on a 386
with 40MB hard disk and 2MB memory salvaged from the scrap heap),
then migrated to the Linux environment.</p><p><a href="2983f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
GRASS-generated Results</b></span></a></p><p>As the project unfolded, it became clear that the sheer
volume of incoming data would give us no rest. Each day, the six
field crews were covering thousands of cells on the ground and
sending in mountains of data. Figure 2 shows the display results
generated by GRASS for a small portion of the study area. This
displays the variety of survey units, roads, site boundaries,
artifacts and features. The map output was created in a script file
that can be sent to the screen or the printer. Since development of
the data processing routines coincided with the start of fieldwork,
we quickly developed a backlog of data to process. And since each
of the 180 survey areas was treated the same, we counted on the
power of scripting redundant tasks to increase our efficiency in
keeping up with the data stream. Once our routines were tested,
debugged and on-line, we caught up quickly and were able to keep
pace with the field crews. In the end, we accomplished what had at
times seemed impossible. We are convinced the powerful scripting
and developmental tools available under Linux, coupled with the
sophisticated GIS routines available under GRASS, enabled us to
successfully tackle the difficult and interesting challenges
encountered during our project. Equally important, we were able to
complete this project on time and under budget while creating one
of the most dynamic spatial archaeological databases anywhere. In
retrospect, we realized that even with a greater budget, we could
not have fared better than we did utilizing the strengths of Linux
and GRASS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0420"></a>Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>Although we were able to automate many of the tasks
associated with survey work, we were never able to realize the full
potential of the Linux/GRASS combination to automate virtually all
of these tasks in concert with each other. We feel that a future
project could be designed building on the work completed so far.
This project could include equipping field crews with
differentially corrected GPS receivers and data loggers to record
and correct field data in real time. These data could then be
downloaded at the end of the day and fed into the Postgres database
engine which would provide seamless data entry and manipulation.
Text formatting packages such as nroff/troff or LaTeX would be used
to automate the production of site-specific reports and
documentation. GNUplot could be used to produce the necessary
graphs and charts. GRASS would be used for spatial display
analysis.</p><p>Linked via scripts, we envision a time when field data
collected in this manner could be downloaded, and within an hour,
fully formatted and detailed site reports and maps would begin to
pop out of the printer. Considering that with traditional methods
the time gap between the input of raw data and the finished
site-specific documentation is most often measured in weeks or
months, we feel that this next level of integration is not only
feasible, but advisable. By harnessing the tools Linux has made
freely available, we believe there is much to offer researchers in
this arena. We are glad to see development for both Linux and GRASS
is so actively promoted by their respective communities and look
forward to utilizing these tools to their fullest potential.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0580"></a>GRASS Applications for Other Researchers</h2></div></div><p>Although the project described above is of interest mainly to
other archaeologists, the availability of a powerful GIS package
for Linux is of interest to a larger segment of the Linux
community, notably geographers, geologists and other researchers
dealing with spatial data.</p><p>Development of GRASS languished for several years in the
mid-90's after funding for future development at CERL came to a
halt. There was concern among the international GIS community that
GRASS, the father of raster analytical GIS packages, might finally
be on its way to that great clippings bag in the sky. That fear was
ended in November 1997 when the &ldquo;GRASS Research Group&rdquo; was
established at Baylor University in Texas. This group pledged to
continue development of GRASS. Interested in the ongoing
maintenance and development of the GRASS GIS platform, they
received the copyright for GRASS from CERL.</p><p>Coinciding with this renewed support for GRASS was the
meteoric rise in the numbers of Linux GRASS users around the world,
coupled with the availability of CPUs with sufficient speed to
handle the volumes of data robust GIS package can deliver. The
authors feel it has been the growth of the international Linux
community that has been a major catalyst in giving GRASS a new
lease on life. As Baylor continues to blaze new trails, a large
audience of users eagerly awaits each update. Today, development is
actively continuing, much of it pushed forward by users in the
Linux community. Due to the stability, speed and power of Linux and
its ability to turn even a modest PC into a strong UNIX
workstation, GRASS has found a place in the Linux user
community.</p><p>Since 1998, Linux GRASS has been developed by Markus Neteler,
and the code is freely available at
<a href="http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass" target="_self">http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/</a>
and several mirror sites. Additional UNIX flavors of GRASS are
available from this site. Monthly updates of the GRASS 4.2.1
packages are published out of Hannover. Beside error corrections,
these updates include new modules from independent GRASS
programmers that have been collected from the international
community and integrated into the system package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae07e8"></a>A Great GUI for GRASS</h2></div></div><p>GRASS was the last major GIS package to be completely
command-line driven. A recent major improvement in GRASS has been
the creation of a platform-independent graphical user interface
based on the freely distributed Tcl/Tk libraries. The main work for
this undertaking has been by Jacques Bouchard in France. This
interface, TCLTKGRASS, gives users a clean GUI interface for GRASS
commands and modules, as well as access through the standard
command line. This GUI compliments the key strength of GRASS&mdash;it
operates at the system level, allowing users to utilize the full
suite of Linux utilities in conjunction with GRASS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae08f0"></a>Current Linux GRASS Version</h2></div></div><p><a href="2983f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Sub-Pixel Analysis Results</b></span></a></p><p>The current release of GRASS 4.2.1 now comes with more than
350 modules. In addition to standard GIS functions for raster,
vector and point data, it offers statistical and image processing
capabilities. Markus has recently written an algorithm, called
&ldquo;spectral mixture analysis&rdquo;, that performs sub-pixel analysis and
true coverage degrees in percent. Figure 3 shows the results from a
module for GRASS that allows the user to perform sub-pixel analysis
on vegetation and soil types with the spectral mixture analysis
module. The left map shows the covered soils in percent. The right
map shows the difference between a remotely sensed image and
ground-truthed imagery. Black indicates no difference, red
indicates high difference. Known field errors account for the red
in the middle. This module can be used for geological analysis as
well as detection of minerals based on their spectra. The vector
lines in this image were created using the module
<span   class="bold"><b>r.line</b></span> on the remotely sensed
image, which was much faster than digitizing. This figure was
created using <span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span>, a free drawing
tool with good map scale features.
<span   class="bold"><b>xfig</b></span> is supported in GRASS through
a vector and raster exporting module. GRASS users can also rectify
off-nadir aerial images taken with a hand-held camera from a small
plane and convert them into quasi-orthophotos usable for area or
distance calculations or mapping purposes. An overview of Linux
GRASS, the tutorials and sample data are also available from
Markus's University of Hannover, Germany, web site at
<a href="http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/welcome.html" target="_self">www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/welcome.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1ae0c60"></a>GRASS 5.0&mdash;The Next Generation</h2></div></div><p>On Feb. 1, 1999, Baylor and Hannover simultaneously released
the GRASS 5.0 beta. This was the first major upgrade to GRASS in a
number of years. The demand was so high that downloads at Baylor
accounted for 20% of the entire university Internet traffic. To
date, several thousand unique downloads of Linux GRASS have been
made from the Hannover site, which is currently transferring 5GB a
week. This volume is steadily increasing. A stable release of GRASS
5.0 is planned for early summer&mdash;by the time you read this.
Currently, bug reports are being collected and fixes applied to the
code. The code is also being modified to make GRASS 64-bit
compliant.</p><p><a href="2983f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. NVIZ,
a 3-D Visualization Tool</b></span></a></p><p>The most significant new features of GRASS 5.0 are
floating-point support in raster format and an improved sites
format. Because all raster modules have to be rewritten, this is a
major step in GRASS development. For the stable 5.0 version,
several other projects are on the list. The NVIZ tool, a robust
three-dimensional visualization tool, is currently being ported to
Linux and other UNIX systems from SGI to aid in viewing 3-D GRASS
data with raster/vector/sites overlaying features (Figure 4). This
tool allows users to display 3-D raster data as stacked layers,
with raster, vector and sites draped as overlays. It will be a very
useful (and much sought-after) tool for data visualization.</p><p>To encourage user development of GRASS routines, the GRASS
5.0 programmer's tutorial will be available very soon. In the near
future, the growth of GRASS will include introducing a new vector
format. This is part of the long-term plan to continue the
evolution of GRASS to a true 3-D/4-D GIS system. It will
incorporate an improved 3-D raster format and new 3-D vector
formats.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e7580.0x1debce0"></a>Linux GRASS is Spreading</h2></div></div><p>A friend recently summed up the future of GRASS and Linux
quite well. He was leaving a research position to go work for a
state agency using their expensive off-the-shelf GIS and
remote-sensing packages; however, he had also worked with GRASS on
a Sun box. Before he left, he sat down with me to get some
information on setting up a Linux box on his office Wintel machine.
As he said, &ldquo;I need to be able to get the real spatial work done
on a stable platform that is not going to crash; those commercial
packages on Wintels are just too buggy.&rdquo; When I sent him a copy of
this last paragraph now that he has been in the office for some
months, he responded, &ldquo;You can say that again and again and
again....&rdquo; One more sign that the Linux juggernaut continues on
its way into the workplace.</p></div></div>
