    Most companies&mdash;especially those in the technology world&mdash;are
    not interested in simple answers to simple questions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b22138"></a></h2></div></div><p>For most of my adult life I have been two
things: a journalist and a marketing expert. Frankly, I did the
latter mostly to sublimate the former. This made me a very
different kind of marketing expert&mdash;one who brought a writer's
skepticism to the marketer's job. At every meeting, I always seemed
to be asking the same two questions: what is this and what's the
story?
</p><p>Most companies&mdash;especially those in the technology world&mdash;are
not interested in simple answers to simple questions. They make
&ldquo;solutions&rdquo; rather than products and &ldquo;management inference
engines&rdquo; rather than spreadsheets. They also want their stories to
consist entirely of happy beginnings.</p><p>&ldquo;Reporters write stories,&rdquo; I would say, &ldquo;and stories don't
start with <span   class="emphasis"><em>happily ever after</em></span>. They start with
a character with a problem. The solution comes at the end, and you
never want to get there or the writer will find some other story to
tell.&rdquo;</p><p>I didn't get very far with this approach. What got me
somewhere was working on the character issue. I called this
&ldquo;positioning&rdquo; and I wasn't alone.</p><p>Hotbot finds 233,780 pages on the Web with the word
&ldquo;positioning&rdquo; in them. When I weed out GPS and other
non-marketing meanings, I get 26,940 pages, almost entirely by
marketing consultancies selling &ldquo;strategic distribution
analysis&rdquo;, &ldquo;rollout plan reviews&rdquo;, &ldquo;campaign launch programs&rdquo;,
&ldquo;performance impact studies&rdquo;, &ldquo;collateral market options&rdquo;,
&ldquo;market penetration analyses&rdquo;, &ldquo;outsourced staff deployments&rdquo;
and other such nonsense, all served up in euphemistically
delusional language.</p><p>No wonder Linux is a hit. It is a character with a story none
of those 27,000 agencies&mdash;including mine&mdash;could have thought up.
Who would seriously talk about &ldquo;world domination&rdquo; and &ldquo;software
that doesn't suck&rdquo; in the face of Microsoft, whose software runs
on every computer you see and whose market value exceeds the GNP of
the Southern Hemisphere? <span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;You see, there was this
Finnish guy, and something about a penguin...&rdquo;</em></span> I don't
think so.</p><p>Thus, what we have with Linux is more than the world's first
big-time open-source operating system. We have the world's first
marketing success that owes nothing to marketing. This warrants
further study.</p><p>I just did for Linux what I used to do for my clients. I took
a look at how the customers for Linux's message&mdash;the analysts,
reporters and editors of the world&mdash;are describing its character
and telling its story. I got on AltaVista
(http://www.altavista.com/) and looked up every page with the
phrase &ldquo;Linux is...&rdquo; and found over 27,000. Searching through
links to the first fifty, I came up with these answers, which I
sort into four ways of depicting Linux's character:</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a2a580.0x1b22558"></a>Descriptive (you've got to start

default story is about a fight between this Finnish dude and a
Schwarzenegger character and it isn't an act. Here's a look at six
different &ldquo;versus&rdquo; constructions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux vs. Microsoft: 57</p></li><li><p>Microsoft vs. Linux: 110</p></li><li><p>Linux vs. NT: 512</p></li><li><p>Linux vs. (Windows, Cisco, BeOS...) 1968</p></li><li><p>Microsoft vs. (DOJ, Justice, Netware...)
2721</p></li></ul></div><p>A big part of positioning is unconscious, yet revealed by who
you list first. Is it Yankees vs. Dodgers or Dodgers vs. Yankees?
We tend to list favorites first. So if I had to call a play-by-play
on the games here, I'd say Microsoft appears to be the favorite in
the company game, while Linux is the favorite in the OS game
(which, fortunately, is the one that truly matters).</p><p>Even when editors don't use the &ldquo;versus&rdquo; construction, they
still apply a rule I obtained recently from a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street
Journal</em></span> reporter: &ldquo;These days you can't write about
Microsoft without bringing up Linux.&rdquo; It's <span   class="emphasis"><em>pro
forma</em></span>. Even if they know nothing about Linux, they still
cast its character.</p><p>And what about Microsoft, really? Does this corporate
Terminator truly consider Linux to be a competitor? &ldquo;This much is
clear to them, right to the top of the company.&rdquo; One
cross-platform developer told me this morning, &ldquo;They can't win the
server war. There's no way they can lock it down like they did with
the desktop. Linux is now the server of choice. They know they have
to cope with that, and they're really not sure how to do
it.&rdquo;</p><p>Let's hope they start figuring out how. Microsoft is a
problem we don't want to lose.</p></div></div>
