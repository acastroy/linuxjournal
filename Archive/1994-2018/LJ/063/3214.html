    A look at CORBA implementations in Java to provide
    interoperability between platforms.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2d580.0xc25818"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the past couple of months we have
endeavored to present an overview of distributed application
development on Linux using CORBA. In the first article we dealt
with the question &ldquo;what is CORBA?&rdquo; and covered the basics of
using an ORB with a simple client and server. The second article
introduced two of the most common OMG (Object Management
Group)-supported services, the Naming Service and the Event
Service, and provided an example using both. In this, our third and
last article, we will be digging a little deeper into the
approaches used so far by providing an introduction to &ldquo;tie&rdquo;,
which is a delegatory method of binding to a remote object. To
date, all of our examples have been implemented in C++, but we must
remember that CORBA is designed around the concept of both platform
and language independence. In order to further demonstrate the
concepts of platform and language independence, this time we will
be presenting an example using two different operating system
platforms, one of which is Linux, and our implementation will be in
Java instead of C++.
</p><p>While we used a combination of Linux and Windows when writing
this article, our code should run on any combination of
Java-enabled platforms. That is to say, you should expect this code
to run equally well in a Linux+Solaris environment, or an HPUX+IRIX
environment. For part 3, we have chosen to implement our example
using one of the most popular Java-based ORBs, VisiBroker from
Inprise Corporation. Inprise kindly and officially sanctioned all
the research we conducted.</p><p>As we discussed in the second part, the OMG specification
describes how an ORB bootstraps itself in order to find the
location of the Common Object Services (COS) such as the Naming
Service, Trader Service or Implementation Repository. This
bootstrapping process is hidden within each vendor's implementation
of the <span   class="bold"><b>resolve_initial_references</b></span>
method. The real trick in achieving interoperability between ORBs
is to figure out how to bootstrap against another ORB. VisiBroker
provides a simple proprietary naming service in the form of a
binary executable called the
<span   class="bold"><b>osagent</b></span>. The osagent provides this
basic location service while at the same time supplying a measure
of fault tolerance and load balancing of objects. In the case of
VisiBroker, the implementation of resolve_initial_references has
the ability to locate an osagent and then ask it for direct
references to other COS services. Additionally, both VisiBroker's
Naming Service and Event Service will try to find an osagent when
started in order to register their IORs (interoperable object
references). In our example, the osagent will supply our sample
clients and servers with the references to VisiBroker's Naming and
Event Services and any dependent objects.</p><p>Unfortunately, the osagent is a platform-specific binary
application that has not yet been ported to Linux. The good news is
only one osagent needs to be running on a local network for a
single or group of VisiBroker-based applications to use. For our
examples, we'll be running osagent on an Inprise-supported
operating system. Quoting directly from VisiBroker's 3.4 release
notes, &ldquo;With the exception of the osagent,
<span   class="bold"><b>osfind</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>locserv</b></span> executables, the
VisiBroker for Java ORB is written entirely in Java and can run in
any Java 1.1- or Java 2-compatible environment.&rdquo; So we will run
osagent on a supported platform and do all our other work on Linux.
Since a simple ORB is also bundled with Java 2, be sure to read the
release notes before trying to run VisiBroker using Java 2. The
significant news is, according to James Ferguson, Senior Product
Manager for VisiBroker, &ldquo;Inprise has seen growing corporate demand
for VisiBroker on Linux. This is just another indication of the
rapid growth of Linux in corporations. To participate in this new
growth market, Inprise will be making significant announcements
regarding the availability of VisiBroker for Java and C++ on
Linux.&rdquo; If you'd like to register your support for that direction
or find out more information, Inprise suggests you direct feedback
to news://forums.inprise.com/inprise.public.visibroker.</p><p>The sample code in this article uses a popular OMG CORBA
concept called &ldquo;tie&rdquo;. In part one, our server-based object was
implemented by inheriting from the skeleton implementation
<b  >_sk_InterfaceName</b>, a class that was generated by
OmniORB's IDL (Interface Definition Language) to C++ compiler. By
inheriting from this base class, the developer can concentrate on
implementing only the interfaces that have been defined in the IDL
and not having to worry about all of the code that actually makes
the CORBA communication possible. Multiple inheritance is sometimes
used to allow for the inheritance of the skeleton provided by the
IDL compiler, sometimes called the BOA (basic object adapter)
implementation, as well as allowing the implementation to inherit
from some other parent class. When the implementation is written in
Java, which doesn't support multiple inheritance, this situation
becomes problematic. Without multiple inheritance, it becomes
impossible to inherit both a skeleton base class and another base
class, such as an application framework.</p><p>To address this, the OMG specification defines a delegate
class called the <b  >tie</b> class. The IDL compiler for
OmniORB generates an interface called
<b  >_tie_<i><tt>InterfaceName</tt></i></b> to
address this role, while VisiBroker's Java IDL compiler generates a
Java interface called
<b  ><i><tt>InterfaceName</tt></i>Operations</b>.
Rather than inheriting from the base implementation class, the
developer instead implements a generated interface called an
operations interface, which contains no methods, attributes or
properties other than those defined in the IDL. The operations
class is then passed in the constructor to a wrapper tie class
which implements each method in the interface by delegating to the
operations interface object. The tie class implements the orb
functionality supplied by the generated base implementation. The
tie object is then the component that is actually bound to the orb.
Since the implementation of our interface is no longer inheriting
from the base implementation, this frees up the developer to
inherit from another base class such as an application
framework.</p><p>In order to better understand how to implement a CORBA
solution in Java, let's compare a Java implementation to a C++
implementation, which readers of parts one and two should be
familiar with. There are several differences in the way a CORBA
application is implemented in Java versus C++. Concentrating on the
VisiBroker for Java implementation and the VisiBroker for C++
implementation, the difference can most obviously be seen in the
number of files generated by the Java
<span   class="bold"><b>idl2java</b></span> compiler and the C++
<span   class="bold"><b>idl2cpp</b></span> compiler. Basically, the
idl2java creates about twice as many files as the idl2cpp compiler.
The idl2java compiler even creates a new subdirectory to hold all
the new files it generates. Certain flags can help control the
number and types of files generated. When you run idl2cpp without
any flags on, this very simple IDL file (example.idl) is
generated:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
   interface SimpleInterface
   {
      void SimpleOperation(in short x);
   };
};
</pre><p>Also, the following files are created:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>example_c.hh: contains the class definitions for
SimpleInterface, along with supporting classes.</p></li><li><p>example_c.cc: contains stub code to be compiled and
linked with the client, which provides support functions (such as
_ptr and _var definitions).</p></li><li><p>example_s.hh: contains the definitions for the
<b  >_sk_Account</b> skeleton class for inheritance with
the <span   class="bold"><b>bind</b></span> method, along with the
tie classes for delegation in the
<span   class="bold"><b>tie</b></span> method.</p></li><li><p>example_s.cc: contains the internal skeleton's
marshaling code, etc.</p></li></ul></div>

The same IDL file will generate the following files when compiled
by the idl2java compiler (note these files would be contained in a
subdirectory called Example):
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SimpleInterface.java: provides a simple public
interface definition for the SimpleInterface declared in the IDL.
This interface simply mimics, in Java, the interface defined in the
IDL. The actual implementation of this Java interface is contained
in the <b  >_SimpleInterfaceImplBase</b> class
(supplemented by the actual implementation you will write).</p></li><li><p>SimpleInterfaceHelper.java: provides helper methods
for SimpleInterface clients. Among these helper methods are the
ever-important bind method overloads, as well as a
<span   class="bold"><b>narrow</b></span> function (for use in the
tie method).</p></li><li><p>SimpleInterfaceHolder.java: provides a Java class
that holds a public instance of a SimpleInterface object. It
provides a wrapper class for a SimpleInterface object, which is
necessary to allow the passing of SimpleInterface objects as
<b  >out</b> and <b  >inout</b> parameters in
function calls declared in an IDL interface.</p></li><li><p>SimpleInterfaceOperations.java: provides classes
that assist in the implementation of the tie method. (Not created
if the <b  >-no_tie</b> flag is given).</p></li><li><p>_SimpleInterfaceImplBase.java: provides an abstract
public Java class that implements the server-side skeleton for
SimpleInterface. This base class itself extends
org.omg.CORBA.protable.Skeleton, and implements
Example.SimpleInterface. Your implementation inherits from this
base when using the bind over the tie method.</p></li><li><p>_example_SimpleInterface.java: provides simple code
that you can fill in to implement the SimpleInterface object on the
server side.</p></li><li><p>_st_SimpleInterface.java: provides a Java class
that implements the client-side stub, which proxies the
SimpleInterface object on behalf of the client. The client makes
calls on this proxy.</p></li><li><p>_tie_SimpleInterface.java: provides the delegation
class used to implement the tie method on the server side.</p></li></ul></div>

Exactly twice as many files are generated by default by the
idl2java compiler as compared to the idl2cpp compiler. This is
partially because of language differences between the two
languages. Java has no user support for pointers (the language has
support only for pass-by-reference for objects), so holder classes
are needed to support <b  >out</b> and
<b  >inout</b> IDL parameter types. Every ORB-defined, as
well as every user-defined, type has an associated holder class
defined to support the IDL <b  >out</b> and
<b  >inout</b> semantics. You can think of holder classes
as pure wrapper classes containing a value that is an instance of
the actual fundamental class. Holder classes implement the
<span   class="bold"><b>org.omg.CORBA.portable.Streamable</b></span>
interface, which allows for the reading and writing of objects and
streams. Holder classes are named by simply taking the base class
name and appending &ldquo;Holder&rdquo; to it.
</p><p>The idl2java compiler also generates a helper class for every
interface. Helper classes offer a number of static methods which
provide clients with vital functionality. These include the bind
and narrow methods, which allow clients to connect to server-based
objects. They also provide read and write methods to assist the
Holder classes in translating between I/O streams and native object
types. They also supply type code information that is useful when
it comes to <b  >Any</b> types and the Dynamic Invocation
and Dynamic Skeleton interfaces. Type codes provide for runtime
detection of type mismatches, along with metadata support for
runtime type information. Since Java is primarily an interpreted
language, it must be careful of added memory constraints. Helper
classes help by off-loading several rarely used methods, such as
bind and narrow, so that the actual object implementations can
avoid loading these methods. You might call the
<span   class="bold"><b>calculate</b></span> method a hundred times a
second, but you'll usually call bind only once.</p><p>Beyond the generated helper classes, the Java and C++
implementations using CORBA look very similar. For example, the
only true difference between finding a naming context under C++ and
Java is the use of the helper class to do the narrow.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Mico C++:
CORBA::Object_var nsobj =
  orb-&gt;resolve_initial_references ("NameService");
CosNaming::NamingContext_var nc =
  CosNaming::NamingContext::_narrow (nsobj);
VisiBroker Java:
org.omg.CORBA.Object objRef =
  orb.resolve_initial_references("NameService");
org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContext rootContext =
  org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContextHelper.narrow
      (objRef);
</pre><p>Our example demonstrates a simple logging facility that makes
use of the VisiBroker for Java Naming and Event Service, as well as
demonstrates the use of the tie mechanism in Java. The example
offers a Log Service and two clients: one supplies events
(messages) to the Log Service, the other consumes (reads) those
messages or events.
</p><p>Our example for this article is a simple message delivery
service in the form of a logger, implemented using classes that
interact with the VisiBroker for Java Event Service. A Supplier
generates strings and then delivers them to a Log Service, a Java
class that extends the Push Supplier interface. The Log Service
publishes a function called <span   class="bold"><b>send</b></span>
which allows one of its clients (a Supplier) to publish events
(send messages) to the event queue. The send method forwards that
event by pushing it onto the event queue. The PullConsumer, another
client in the scene, binds to the event channel, then proceeds to
pull the events issued by the Supplier from the queue. The example
demonstrates both the use of the Naming and Event Services in
VisiBroker for Java as well as the tie mechanism. (The LogService
is implemented using the tie method.) The example has been kept
simple in order to easily communicate the issues involved. Error
handling, for example, has been kept to an absolute minimum so as
to not obscure the foundational elements. Thus, the path a string
travels through the system is as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Supplier creates string.</p></li><li><p>Calls send on Log Service.</p></li><li><p>Log Service forwards string to Event Channel via
<span   class="bold"><b>push</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>Event Channel buffers the string for
Consumer.</p></li><li><p>Consumer polls the Event Channel for a new
string.</p></li><li><p>Consumer retrieves the string from the Event
Channel.</p></li></ol></div><p><a href="3214l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. EventCannel.idl</a>
</p><p>The IDL for our logging facility is extremely simple (see
Listing 1). It defines a module called logging and a single
interface named LogService that implements a single function,
called send, that accepts a single string parameter. This string is
passed to the Log Service, which is then placed on the Event
Channel, where it awaits being read by the Consumer. The Consumer
polls the Event Channel periodically, checking to see if a new
event (String message) has been delivered. If it has, it pulls that
String from the Event Channel and prints it to STDOUT.</p><p>IDL modules are mapped, in CORBA's Java mapping, to Java
packages. Therefore, the logging module in the IDL is mapped to a
logging package that, by default in Java, is a subdirectory under
the directory which contains the IDL file. It is the logging
package (directory) that contains all the files generated by the
idl2java compiler. When built, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>logging</em></span>
directory contains eight Java files, generated by the idl2java
compiler. The directory contains class definitions for the
LogService interface, Helper and Holder classes which we mentioned
above, and the tie and ImplBase classes for delegation and
binding.</p><p><a href="3214l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. LJEventChannel.java</a></p><p>Listing 2 shows the
<span   class="bold"><b>LJEventChannel.java</b></span> source, which
defines two classes. LogServiceImpl and LJEventChannel. The
LogServiceImpl class extends the _PushSupplierImplBase base class,
and implements LogServiceOperations. The LogServiceOperations class
has the capabilities necessary for the tie mechanism, which we will
use to connect to the <b  >LogServiceImpl</b> object. The
LogServiceImpl class provides the core functionality for binding to
the proper VisiBroker Event Service channel. Since LogServiceImpl
extends _PushSupplierImplBase, it is able to function in the role
of a Push Supplier vis-&agrave;-vis the Event Service (for more
information, see last month's article).</p><p>The meat of the LogServiceImpl class is in its constructor.
When a new <b  >LogServiceImpl</b> object is created, the
constructor first binds to the ORB via an
<span   class="bold"><b>org.omg.CORBA.ORB.init</b></span> call. Then,
it connects to a particular event channel, &ldquo;channel_server&rdquo;, in
order to pass strings via the Push Consumer proxy it creates. The
actual process of connecting to the Event Channel was covered in
detail last month; however, we will summarize the steps here
briefly.</p><p>First, the bind method is called on the EventChannelHelper
class that is part of VisiBroker's Event Service. The Naming
service is not necessary to connect to the Event Service, because
the osagent facilitates the binding by using its own simple naming
service.</p><p>Once an EventChannel is bound, a Push Consumer proxy is
obtained from the Event Channel, and then our LogServiceImpl object
is connected to the proxy. This allows us to make calls on the
proxy. From this point on, any supplier who calls the send method
on our <b  >LogServiceImpl</b> object will cause our
implementation to call the push method on its Push Consumer proxy.
This is done with the line
<b  >_pushConsumer.push(message)</b>. Notice that, as
usual, we've packaged our string to be sent in an
<b  >Any</b> type, which the Event Service requires for
transmission.</p><p>Class LJEventChannel consists of a single
<span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span> method which, after binding
to the ORB and initializing the Basic Object Adapter for our
object, creates a new <b  >LogServiceImpl</b> object
described above. The tie method is used in the binding process,
which means we will be using delegation instead of inheritance in
our communication with the object's implementation. After we have
tied to our new LogServiceImpl delegate named &ldquo;new_service&rdquo;, we
then bind that service object to the Naming Service under the
component path
<b  >Linux&nbsp;Journal:LJEventChannel</b>. This allows
any client object on any machine in the visible network to connect
to our new_service object via this naming convention, without
having to know the name or IP address of the hosting
machine.</p><p>Once the new_service delegate has been bound to the Naming
Service, the BOA is advised that the object is ready and available
and the implementation of the server is complete.</p><p>At this point, an implementation of the LogService interface
defined in the IDL has been created and published and is now
available for calls from clients wishing to use its send method to
post messages to the Event Channel.</p><p><a href="3214l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
PushSupplier.java</a></p><p>Listing 3 shows PushSupplier.java, the supplier in our
application. Class PushSupplier consists entirely of a single main
method, which after initializing the orb with
org.mg.CORBA.ORB.init, stores the name of the supplier which was
optionally entered on the command line when the supplier was
started. This arbitrary name allows you to name your suppliers
Supplier1, Supplier2, etc., so that you will know, on the consumer
side, which supplier's string was obtained. After initializing the
ORB, a LogService reference named <b  >logger</b> is
created. Then we enter a try block, which seeks to bind to the
<b  >LogServiceImpl</b> object already created using the
Naming Service. The supplier calls the resolve_initial_references
method on the orb object, obtains a root context, creates the
appropriate name components, and calls
<span   class="bold"><b>resolve</b></span> on the root context using
the created name component array. The generic object reference
returned is then narrowed by a call to narrow using the
<b  >LogServiceHelper</b> object.</p><p>Assuming the <b  >logger</b> object is not null, we
then enter a loop that continually sends a string to the
LogServiceImpl object via its send method. This continues until the
user interrupts the supplier with <b  >ctrl-C</b>.</p><p><a href="3214l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
PullConsumer.java</a></p><p>Listing 4 shows the PullConsumer class, which extends the
_PullConsumerImplBase base class of the VisiBroker Event Service.
After initializing the ORB and BOA, the PullConsumer object
attempts to bind to the Event Channel by calling the bind method on
the EventChannelHelper object. Then a new PullConsumer object is
created, which implements the
<span   class="bold"><b>disconnect_pull_consumer</b></span> method
required by a PullConsumer. The reason a new PullConsumer must be
created is because we need an object reference to pass to the BOA's
<span   class="bold"><b>obj_is_ready</b></span> and the proxy Pull
Supplier's <span   class="bold"><b>connect_pull_consumer</b></span>
method. Since we are in the main method which is static, no
&ldquo;implicit this&rdquo; reference is available to us. Therefore, we need
to create a <span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> object in order to obtain a
reference to pass. Once a new PullConsumer object is created, the
BOA is advised that the object is ready. After this, a Pull
Supplier proxy is created via a call to the bound channel's
<span   class="bold"><b>obtain_pull_supplier</b></span> method. Once
the proxy is created, the PullConsumer object is connected to the
proxy by calling connect_pull_consumer on the proxy, passing it the
PullConsumer object.</p><p>At this point, a <b  >while</b> loop is entered,
and the consumer continually calls
<span   class="bold"><b>try_pull</b></span> on the Pull Supplier
proxy. If the proxy finds an event, then that event is returned,
the PullConsumer object prints that message to standard output and
the loop restarts.</p><p>You can try out this application by first running a single
PushSupplier and PullConsumer locally on the same Linux box. (See
the README.install and README.run instructions that accompany the
code for details on the setup, building and launching of the
applications.) Then you might want to launch another PushSupplier
and notice that the PullConsumer automatically begins to process
events from the new PushSupplier as well. (You might want to name
the PushSuppliers as they are launched&mdash;see the README.run
instructions on how to do this.) Then launch a new PullConsumer
over on the Windows (or other OS) box, and watch how events from
the two suppliers are conveyed to the two consumers, one of which
is now running on the Windows machine. Finally, launch another
PushSupplier on the Windows machine and watch how two consumers
process strings created and delivered to the same event channel by
three separate suppliers. Even though the code is simple, the
project implemented here is quite capable and has some broad
implications which you should explore.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb2d580.0x1020718"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In these three articles, we have attempted to introduce you
