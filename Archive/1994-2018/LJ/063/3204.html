    This month Mr. Sissom shows us how to set up and use a
    Sybase client written in Perl through examples.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x140b580.0x15032f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we installed a Sybase
database server. This month, we will install a client to access our
server. First, we need to understand how the Sybase network
interface works.
</p><p>A Sybase client must create a network connection to a
database server when it needs to access resources in the database
(see Figure 1). Sybase has created a protocol to communicate over
the network. This protocol is called the Tabular Data Stream (TDS)
protocol. It operates on top of other networking protocols such as
TCP/IP on UNIX systems or IPX/SPX on Novell networks. TDS is a
proprietary protocol and not documented by Sybase. Fortunately,
Sybase has created client libraries which can be used to
communicate with the server. A group of people have tried to
reverse-engineer the TDS protocol. Look at
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/freetds" target="_self">http://sunsite.unc.edu/freetds/</a>
for more information.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3204f1.large.jpg"><img src="3204f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. TDS Protocol
</p></div></div><p>Sybase supports two interfaces to the database. DB-Library is
an API that has been used for quite awhile in Sybase products. I
believe it is supported for backwards compatibility, and may not be
supported in a future version of the product. CT-Library is the API
Sybase created for version 10 and higher products. It supports
advanced features such as cursors and asynchronous query
processing. You don't need to understand these features to do basic
processing with your database server. We will use CT-Library to
communicate with our server.</p><p>We could write our client using C or C++. The libraries
required to do this are included with the server. Look for examples
in the sample directory under the server directory. There is a
subdirectory for DB-Library and one for CT-Library. We don't have
to use C or C++, however. An extension to the Perl language called
<span   class="bold"><b>sybperl</b></span> enables the use of Perl to
write clients to access the database.</p><p>Most Linux distributions come with the Perl language. On my
system, I have installed Red Hat 5.1 which includes Perl version 5
by default. Fortunately, it is possible to install sybperl without
recompiling Perl. Using this method precludes the use of the
DB-Library, which is why we have chosen to use CT-Library.</p><p>If Perl is not installed on your system, install it now. If
your distribution does not provide perl, you can download the
source from CPAN
(<a href="http://www.cpan.org" target="_self">http://www.cpan.org/</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x140b580.0x1503870"></a>Install sybperl</h2></div></div><p>First, we must download sybperl from
<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Michael_Peppler" target="_self">http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Michael_Peppler/</a></p><p>The newest version available at the time of this writing is
version 2.09_05 in the file sybperl-2.09_05.tar.gz (148KB). Change
directories to the location of the sybperl tar file, and issue the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL
</pre><p>Change to the sybperl directory just created, and edit the
CONFIG file. In the line <b  >DBLIBVS=1000</b>, change
the 1000 to 0. Make sure the line
<b  >SYBASE=/opt/sybase</b> contains the correct
directory for the Sybase server. The line
<b  >EXTRA_LIBS=-ltli</b> must be changed to
<b  >EXTRA_LIBS=-linsck</b>.
</p><p>We will build sybperl to work with CT-library. Most Linux
distributions come with the Berkeley DB library. If Perl is
configured to use this library, a conflict arises when using
DB-library at the same time, since both use the call
<span   class="bold"><b>open_database</b></span>. If you recompile
Perl to leave out the Berkeley DB library, you can leave the line
<b  >DBLIBVS=1000</b> in the CONFIG file and use
DB-library.</p><p>Save the changes to the CONFIG file, then issue this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL
</pre><p>This will create a file that will build the software. It
looks for the Perl installation in your path. If Perl isn't in your
path, you'll need to change your path to include it. Now issue the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command to build the
software; it will take a few minutes to run.
<span   class="bold"><b>sybperl</b></span> has tests that can be run
to ensure it is built properly. To run these tests, edit the PWD
file to put your <b  >sa</b> password and the name of
your Sybase server on the proper lines. If you installed the server
following the directions in the last issue, the name of the server
is linux_dev. Save the file, then type the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
make test
</pre>


This command will run a series of tests. If everything is working
properly, the message &ldquo;All tests successful&rdquo; will be printed.
</p><p>Now, let's install sybperl. If your Perl installation is in a
directory that requires root access to modify, change to root using
<span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span>. Run the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre><p>Perl and sybperl are now installed, so it is time to write
some programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x140b580.0x1504108"></a>Writing a sybperl Program</h2></div></div><p>All of the programs here are available for download. If you
type in these programs, be sure to use
<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> to make them
executable.</p><p><a href="3204l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Writing a sybperl program is quite simple. Listing 1 is our
first example program. This will list the names of all the
databases in the server. Here is a line-by-line explanation of the
program.</p><p>Line 1 tells Linux which program to use to run this script.
This must be the new version of Perl you just installed. Make sure
you change this line to point to the correct version of Perl on
your system.</p><p>Line 3 tells Perl to use the CT-library interface to Sybase.
It should be at the beginning of all Perl scripts you write that
access a Sybase server.</p><p>Line 5 attaches to the correct Sybase server. The first
parameter is the user name, the second is the password and the
third is the name of the server.</p><p>Line 7 is the SQL to run.</p><p>Lines 9-10 are commands that run the query on the server and
return a reference to an array of rows, <b  >@rows</b>.
Note this command loads the entire result set into memory. This is
fine for small result sets, but if you are expecting a large result
set, you shouldn't use <span   class="bold"><b>ct_sql</b></span>.
Later, I will give you an alternative method for executing commands
and receiving large result sets.</p><p>Lines 12-14 will print all rows that were returned.</p><p><a href="3204l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Listing 2 is an example of a sybperl program that updates
data. In Line 7, we use the same ct_sql command to send the SQL to
the database, except this time a set of rows is not returned. The
<span   class="bold"><b>insert</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>delete</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span> SQL commands also do not
return rows. The SQL command <b  >use pubs2</b> tells
Sybase to make the pubs2 database the default database for the rest
of this session. In Line 10, we again use the ct_sql command to run
the SQL. This time, we add a row to the discounts table. You can
use the <span   class="bold"><b>isql</b></span> program to run an
<b  >SQL SELECT</b> command to verify that the row was
added.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x140b580.0x1504948"></a>Writing a Perl CGI Client Program</h2></div></div><p>Linux is mostly used as a web server, and Perl is primarily
used to write web applications. So, we will create a Perl program
to access the Sybase database.</p><p><a href="3204l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Writing a CGI program to access Sybase is quite simple.
Listing 3 is the complete code of a CGI program to let you know
who's logged in to your Sybase server. Place this program in your
web server's cgi-bin directory. On a default Red Hat system, the
directory is /home/httpd/cgi-bin/. For this example, name the
program listing3.pl.</p><p>In lines 5 and 6, we set two environment variables. The
Sybase DB-Library and CT-Library must find these environment
variables, or an error will occur. When you run a CGI program, very
few environment variables are passed to your program. These two
environment variables must be set in each CGI program that needs to
access Sybase. If you have many CGI programs, place these commands
in a file included in all your CGI programs.</p><p>The <b  >SYBASE</b> environment variable contains
the directory of the Sybase software. The
<b  >DSQUERY</b> variable contains the name of the
default server.</p><p>The only other difference between this example and the others
is it outputs HTML to a browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x140b580.0x14fb5a0"></a>Other Considerations</h2></div></div><p>These example programs show the basics of accessing a Sybase
database server. In production programs, a few more things must be
taken care of in your programs.</p><p>Errors from the server must be handled properly. If you
ignore them, your program will stop when it encounters a server
error.</p><p>In all our example programs, ct_sql was used to run queries.
It works fine for SQL commands and stored procedures which don't
return result sets, but would have severe problems for queries
returning large result sets.</p><p><a href="3204l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Listing 4 shows how to handle errors and demonstrate a
replacement for the ct_sql command. In lines 3 and 4, we establish
both a client and a server message call-back routine. These
routines will be called when the server or client generates an
informational or error message.</p><p>In lines 7-20, we handle a single SQL statement. Sybase
allows a single statement to return multiple result sets. Lines
8-10 will process each result set. Lines 17-19 will handle each row
in a result set. Lines 11-16 will look at the result set and print
the names and types of each column. A Sybase result set contains
more than just data&mdash;it also includes column definition
information.</p><p>Lines 23-50 are the two call-back routines. These routines
are called each time there is a message from the server or client.
An example of a client message is the one returned if you can't log
in to the server. An example of a server message is the one
returned if you have an error in your SQL.</p><p>All this information can be found within the sybperl and the
Sybase documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x140b580.0x14fb968"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The Sybase database server is a powerful piece of software.
Unfortunately, all that power comes with a price. Setting up and
supporting a Sybase server isn't as easy as using Postgres or
MySQL, but if you need a heavy-duty, high-performance database,
Sybase is your best bet.</p><p>Next month, we'll discuss application development using
Sybase on Linux. This article will appear in the &ldquo;Strictly
On-line&rdquo; section.</p></div></div>
