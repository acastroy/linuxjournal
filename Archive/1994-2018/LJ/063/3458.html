many PCs are too many for one consultant?&rdquo; I regularly work with
Windows, Linux and SCO operating systems and usually need to test
interaction between different systems. I counted five PCs,
including the company web server sitting on my desk. Coming up with
the magic number four was fairly simple, since my keyboard switcher
had enough slots for only four systems, and I didn't feel like
springing for another box. I tossed the web server under the desk
without a monitor or keyboard. This solution results in loading
different operating systems when I'm working on different
projects&mdash;certainly not very efficient. Finally, I found the
solution&mdash;VMware Virtual Platform from VMware, Inc.
</p><p>In mid-February, a colleague sent me an e-mail message
describing a virtual machine for PCs. This sparked my
interest&mdash;could it be real? With a virtual machine such as the one
my friend described, the possibilities seemed endless. Virtual
machines ran on old IBM mainframes; surely you would need special
hardware and not just your average &ldquo;run of the mill&rdquo; PC sold
today. A few clicks of the mouse took me to the VMware web site,
where mention was made of an upcoming beta program. I signed up and
waited patiently for the beta release date of March 15.</p><p><a href="3458f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
VMware Bios Screen</b></span></a></p><p>According to the web site, VMware for Linux allows your PC to
act as a host operating system for virtual machines which I call
VMs. The virtual machine presents a complete image of a standard PC
to the guest operating system. The VM also has its own BIOS (see
Figure 1) that can be adjusted just like your real computer. Many
components are virtualized, such as the network card, sound card,
hard drive and mouse. However, the processor is not; it is more
like a serial multiplexer where instructions are multiplexed from
the different VMs and host OS. This gives the user much better
performance, since the instructions are executed without any
translation.</p><p>Unfortunately, this fantastic performance does come at a
cost&mdash;you can't step through a program and you can't test SMP
(symmetrical multi-processing) applications on your VMs. The
stepping problem should be fixed by the time this article is
published, but the SMP issue will take longer. SMP systems are
supported in the host OS, so you can actually have multiple VMs
running on different processors. Virtualization of the hard drive
also adds a wonderful feature for developers&mdash;rollbacks. A VM hard
drive can be configured read-only to allow the guest OS to make
changes in a log file. If something goes wrong, just restart the VM
and everything is back to its original state. Imagine how easy this
makes testing install scripts.</p><p>Finally, the day arrived when I was able to download the beta
to test whether it was all it was cracked up to be. On the morning
of the beta release, the web site received so many hits the company
was forced to quickly put up mirror sites. I was pleased with the
amount of documentation available, including ample information on
the errors you might get and how to fix them.</p><p>I rebooted my primary machine from Windows to Linux and
followed the installation instructions. VMware installed easily and
seemed a perfect fit with Red Hat 5.2 and the 2.0.36 kernel. I then
installed the license file received via e-mail. I started VMware
and went through the configuration wizard, which made it easy to
set up a ready-to-use configuration for Windows 98 (see Figure 2).
Next, I popped in my Windows OEM preboot floppy and clicked the
&ldquo;power&rdquo; button. In the window, a normal BIOS screen appeared with
the VMware logo on the right. Fifteen minutes later, I was done.
Just like a regular PC installation, the new virtual disk was
partitioned and formatted following a virtual reboot and
installation of the OS. There was absolutely no difference between
my test installation and a normal Windows 9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
OEM system load.</p><p><a href="3458f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Windows 98 Startup</b></span></a></p><p>Next, I loaded Caldera, SuSE, Windows 95 and even Windows NT
Terminal Server. All of these operating systems loaded without any
problem, and I used the wonderful documentation to get the virtual
sound and network cards working. Finally, I moved my installations
over to a better-equipped PC, a dual Celeron 300a clocked at 450MHz
with 256MB of RAM and a 13GB hard drive. Since the VMs appear the
same on all hosts, I was able to copy my previous installs over to
the bigger PC. With the addition of power and memory, I was able to
run most of these operating systems simultaneously with ample
performance in each (which was good, since Windows NT Terminal
Server is a resource hog). Probably the best example of performance
was when I started compiling the 2.2.5 Linux kernel on my host PC,
started another kernel compile on a VM running SuSE, and viewed a
RealVideo clip playing in Windows 95 on a VM. The sound and video
never skipped a beat.</p><p><a href="3458f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.

Hat 5.2 Running the GIMP</b></span></a></p><p>Now those four PCs on my desk have become many more. Support
for FreeBSD, Solaris and Windows 2000 Beta are currently underway
and should be available by the time you read this. However, some
operating systems are not on the immediate horizon: SCO OpenServer,
UNIXware and NetBSD are not planned as supported platforms for the
official 1.0 release. VMware allows me to test many versions of
Windows and Linux workstations all at the same time. I am hoping to
learn more about FreeBSD and Solaris once they are supported.
Thanks to the virtualization of the network card, I can assign each
VM its own IP address and actually test how multiple workstations
will interact with each other from one PC. I have found it is even
possible to have a VM respond to a DHCP server when your host OS
does not have an address on the LAN.</p><p>How much does an incredible application like this cost?
Considering the cost of a decent PC today is at least $1000 or
more, I think $999 would be a fantastic price, since it will save
you so much space. The folks at VMware think differently
though&mdash;for just $299 US, you can give your computer a multiple PC
disorder. A student discount of 67%, i.e., to $99, is available.
While I wouldn't recommend this to all the gamers, if you're
developing applications for Linux or Windows this is truly a tool
you should not be without. VMware is also great for testing the new
distributions of Linux with their many new features.</p></div></div>
