<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a book about UNIX. It is about three UNIX
utilities, <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>, each on their own, one after
the other. Now, I learned these tools and others from the classic
text, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The UNIX Programming Environment</em></span> by
Kernighan and Pike. Although dated in parts, the treatment there
crams a good deal of information into a short space and never loses
sight of the fact that AWK, sed and similar tools are designed to
be used in a UNIX environment, working with the shell and other
UNIX tools. Ripping them out of context causes them to seem much
less useful than they are. In this book, there is hardly a pipeline
in sight. Not only that, we don't even see sed and AWK working
together through temporary files. Each tool is considered in
complete isolation. There is little point in learning about AWK and
sed on their own. If one is really determined to do everything
without the shell and other utilities, Perl is a proper superset of
the two. AWK and sed come into their own only when considered as
part of a toolset.
</p><p>This book has too much padding. I don't know how many times
we are told where the web site associated with the book is, but
once would have been enough. I personally hate those little icons
popular in books of this sort today. Each time our intrepid author
mentions the web, we have a picture of a spider's web (I'm not
making this up), each aside or technical tip (I don't really know
what to call them&mdash;the only clue is the little icon beside each
one) has a top hat affixed to it, and so on. I don't know whether
this is all IDG's fault, but it was in their &ldquo;For Dummies&rdquo; series
where I first encountered this style. There, while still
objectionable to my mind (and don't get me started on said company
referring to customers as &ldquo;Dummies&rdquo;!), it is at least
well-thought-out and integrated into the book; here, it's just
pointless. If I want pictures, I'll go read a comic book.</p><p>No mention is made of <span   class="emphasis"><em>which</em></span> AWK or sed
or grep. For instance, one might be using GNU awk (gawk), nawk,
mawk, MKS awk or any one of several vendor implementations,
although hardly the original awk. These things matter. Are we
talking strict POSIX sed and AWK here? We are not told. This topic
needs to be addressed, however briefly, in any book dealing with
these tools.</p><p>Is there anything I like about his book? Well, the exercises
and self-review questions are frequent and, although often simple,
do have the merit of being connected to the preceding subject
matter, covering what you are supposed to have learned. They've
been given consideration and aren't just tacked on as an
afterthought.</p><p>This book might be useful for those who find the treatment in
Kernighan &amp; Pike too concise; but it needs to be supplemented,
if not replaced, by a book which discusses these tools in their
proper context. Personally, I find the right thing is just such a
dual approach. Rely on a good learner's book, but have at hand a
reference work which goes into much greater detail and can be
consulted when problems or questions arise. Unfortunately, this
book is neither. For instance, there is an &ldquo;Awk, sed and grep&rdquo;
reference listed as an appendix. Turning to the appendices, we find
a rather sparse reference for AWK only, with no mention of the
other two.</p><p>It isn't that this is a bad book for what it does. However,
what it does isn't enough and is aimed at the wrong market. The
cover proclaims, &ldquo;Perfect for first-time and intermediate UNIX
programmers alike&rdquo;. Very little is contained here for either
first-time or intermediate UNIX programmers or users. It would be
better suited to a Windows user who has the Cygnus Win32 toolkit
and wants to know what to do with it. Even then, some coverage of
the shell is almost essential. Realistically, the people who want a
Win32 environment to look like UNIX are going to be people with
UNIX experience, and this book is not for them. So what is the
market? Well, that's the biggest problem with this book. Within its
rather narrow remit, it does things well; but it doesn't have a
well-defined audience. If you need to learn about sed and AWK, then
the best resources remain Kernighan &amp; Pike and O'Reilly's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span>.</p><p>I find it hard to recommend this book to anyone. It might
possibly be useful, if supplemented by a general work on using the
shell, for those who need a slow and easy introduction to sed and
AWK.</p></div></div>
