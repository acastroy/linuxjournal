    Is MP3 the wave of the future? Mr. Knudsen describes this
    new technology and what it will mean to the listener.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1923580.0x1a1b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>MP3 (Motion Picture Experts Group audio
layer 3) is an audio file format capable of storing near CD-quality
audio in relatively small files (as little as 1/10 the size of
comparable WAV files). A four-minute audio track recorded at 44KHz
requires about 4MB in MP3 format, while the same audio track
recorded in WAV format can occupy over 40MB. MP3 has received a
great deal of attention lately. According to searchterms.com, a
site that ranks the most frequently used search terms, &ldquo;mp3&rdquo; is
number one. That's right&mdash;it's even ahead of &ldquo;sex&rdquo;, which is
number two.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1923580.0x1a1b3f8"></a>MP3 as a Threat</h2></div></div><p>The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) is
concerned that MP3 will make it difficult to sell music on-line, as
MP3 has no mechanism for preventing illegal copying. In December,
RIAA announced its Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) to
encourage technology companies to create a new specification for
on-line music. RIAA also sued Diamond Multimedia in October,
attempting to prevent the sale of Diamond's RIO PMP300 portable MP3
player. Fortunately for Diamond and MP3 fans, RIAA lost the
suit.</p><p>In February, Lycos and FAST launched a search site for MP3
files on the Internet. The site contains a database of over half a
million links to MP3 files. While the site is a great resource for
finding MP3 files, it immediately caused concern about illegal MP3
files. Search for one of your favorite artists, and you may find
links to illegal MP3 files. In March, the International Federation
of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) began legal action against FAST
for its role in the MP3 search site. IFPI members include BMG, EMI,
Sony Music, Universal Music International and Warner Music. In a
statement on their home page, IFPI Director of Operations Mike
Edwards said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The Lycos/FAST search engine should be promoting
opportunities for the many start-up businesses that are pioneering
legitimate electronic delivery of music over the Internet. Instead,
however, this search engine is doing the opposite: it is providing
a service where virtually no authorized files can be found. This is
a threat to the companies who want to build a flourishing legal
electronic marketplace.</p></blockquote></div><p>IBM has introduced its Madison project to allow cable modem
users to purchase music on-line, download it and save it onto
CD-ROM (provided they have a CD-R or CD-RW drive). The CD can then
be played on any CD player. IBM claims the technology will prevent
users from making illegal copies. The project has the backing of
IFPI.
</p><p>Sony has also proposed another way to distribute
copyright-protected music. This system includes MusicGate for
recording and playback and OpenMG for use on computers. OpenMG
would require hardware installed on the computer's serial port to
prevent illegal copying.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1923580.0x1a1b6b8"></a>MP3 Meets Linux</h2></div></div><p>Quite a few MP3 players are already available for Linux. The
console-based <span   class="bold"><b>mpg123</b></span> is popular.
You can use it from either the command line or one of the many
applications that use mpg123 as the MP3 decoder, and have a nice
GUI for song playlist management. GQmpeg is an excellent MP3 player
with a customizable GUI using &ldquo;skins&rdquo;. You can also try one of
the many MP3-capable GUI-based applications that don't use mpg123
as the MP3 decoding engine, such as FreeAmp or X11Amp. Some of the
MP3 players also support streaming MP3 (called Shoutcast), similar
to Real Audio.</p><p>MP3 players are not particularly useful without some MP3
files. MP3.com has a wide variety available for download. Many
users are creating their own MP3 files from their personal CDs.
This is legal for personal use only. You cannot redistribute audio
tracks you copy from one of your CDs. The process of copying the
audio data from a CD is typically called &ldquo;ripping&rdquo;; applications
that do the work are &ldquo;CD rippers&rdquo;. A good tool for this on Linux
is <span   class="bold"><b>cdparanoia</b></span>, which will read
from both SCSI and ATAPI CD-ROMs. The CD rippers typically save
data in WAV format, which must then be converted to MP3 with
another tool such as <span   class="bold"><b>mp3encode</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>bladeenc</b></span>. An increasing number of
console and GUI tools are available to automate this process by
looking up the track names on the Internet with CDDB and then using
external rippers and encoders to do the work. You put the CD in
your CD-ROM, select the tracks to encode and wait.</p><p>Some issues must be considered before converting all your CDs
to MP3. The process can be quite time-consuming for both CD ripping
and encoding. The reading of an audio CD is handled much
differently than a data CD, and the process can take hours. This is
especially true if the CD has scratches on it. Encoding the WAV
files into MP3 can also take hours. This process is best done when
you're not otherwise using your machine. In fact, many
Windows-based encoders have options to power down your machine when
finished. Once your MP3 files are ready, there is still one last
issue to consider. Playing MP3 files can use up a good deal of your
system's CPU cycles. It is typical for MP3 players to use 20% or
more of your CPU cycles on a 200MHz Pentium. That's not a big deal
if you're browsing the Web or using a word processor, but it
certainly is if you're recompiling the kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1923580.0x1a1b9d0"></a>MP3 on the Move</h2></div></div><p>Diamond Multimedia was early to market with the Rio portable
MP3 player. Weighing in at only 2.4 ounces and selling for around
$200, Rio can hold 40 minutes of music and play for 12 hours on a
single AA battery. Because the Rio has no moving parts, the player
won't skip like a CD player when subjected to movement. The music
is stored in 32MB of flash memory, and you can purchase an
additional 16 or 32MB of flash memory. MP3 files are transferred
from your computer via the parallel port at a rate of ten seconds
per megabyte. The software provided with Rio is for use on Windows
95/98, but a few different Linux applications are under development
which can be used to manage Rio's files (see Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1923580.0x1a1bad8"></a>Linux and MP3 in Your Car: Empeg</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3420f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Installed Empeg Player
</p></div></div><p>Empeg is at the cutting edge of MP3 technology with their car
audio player. The unit uses a 220MHz Digital/Intel StrongARM
processor with 8MB of memory and runs Linux 2.2. The player can
handle all types of MP3 files and includes an FM radio (but no AM
due to interference problems). Additionally, you can connect any
standard CD player, tape deck or radio to the player as long as it
has line-level outputs.</p><p>Like Diamond's Rio player, you manage all the files on your
Empeg player from your computer. The Empeg player slides out of the
docking bay in your car so you can connect it to your computer (or
to your home stereo via RCA jacks). The standard interface will be
a Windows 98 application that helps manage your audio tracks via
the USB port. For those without USB (or Windows 98), a version will
be available for Windows 95 and NT that uses RS-232 rather than
USB. Linux tools will also be included and available as source
code. You can expect a group of enthusiasts to help further develop
and improve the Linux tools. The user interface is written in
Python and should allow developers to change the UI.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3420f2.large.jpg"><img src="3420f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Empeg Player
</p></div></div><p>The Empeg player is not something you can build at home.
&ldquo;It's a 100% custom hardware and software effort: there aren't any
off-the-shelf parts in there (there simply isn't room),&rdquo; said
Empeg's Hugo Fiennes. Asked why Linux was chosen, Hugo
replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We needed a powerful, flexible OS to support our
applications: the Empeg does much more than just play tunes&mdash;it has
an integrated database, and uses glibc threads and IPC
(interprocess communication) quite heavily. As the Empeg is hugely
overpowered for its current task, we wanted an OS that would allow
hackers to add their own code to the system.</p></blockquote></div><p>Pricing starts at $999US with a 2.1GB disk capacity that can
store approximately 37 hours of music. A 28GB version will also be
available. The unit should be shipping any time now, and will
initially be available only directly from Empeg
(http://www.empeg.com/). Distribution sales will be considered
after satisfying their backlog of 6000 interested parties.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1923580.0x1a1c108"></a>Down the Road</h2></div></div><p>Much of the interest in MP3 is not a result of the specific
file format, but in what it allows one to do. Why else would people
be excited about something that produces lower-quality sound than
CDs 15 years after CDs were introduced? MP3 returns some of the
power back to the music enthusiasts, who can now listen to a custom
selection of their favorite singles. With the help of a computer,
MP3 allows people to create their own personal commercial-free
radio station.</p><p>It can also be said that MP3 is forcing the recording
industry into the on-line music business. The industry giants seem
content with their current business model. With full-length CDs
accounting for 74.8% of music sales according to RIAA's 1998
Consumer Profile, they're making a lot of money. The future of
on-line music sales is not in selling CDs from an on-line music
store. It will involve selling digital audio and delivering it over
the Internet. Users will be able to buy only the music they want,
not forced to pay $10 or $15 to get the one or two songs they like.
Even if something other than MP3 takes us there, it will still be a
good thing.</p><p><a href="3420s2.html" target="_self">Hugo Fiennes
