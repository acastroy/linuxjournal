    A look at an automatic circuit analysis program through
    engineering-based examples.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>SCEPTRE is an automatic circuit analysis
program capable of determining initial condition, transient,
frequency and steady-state response of electrical networks and
dynamic systems. It is considered a general-purpose tool for
engineers and can be used to assist in the design and analysis of
various circuits. The problem of interest is described in a
free-format, easy-to-learn, engineer-oriented language. The basic
set of network elements consists of linear and nonlinear resistors,
capacitors, inductors, voltage and current sources, and mutual
inductances.
</p><p>In addition, SCEPTRE has a &ldquo;Defined Parameter&rdquo; mode
allowing it to solve state equations, which might be written to
describe non-electrical systems. This outstanding feature allows
the user to couple electrical networks with differential equation
systems giving a great deal of versatility, especially for
interdisciplinary problems like mechatronics.</p><p>If the problem of interest cannot be described by the
built-in functions, the user can describe his problem as an ultima
ratio via a FORTRAN program. The program uses the state variable
method. Other highlights are the model library, reruns with
automatic varied network quantities, extended DC options
(sensitivity, worst-case, Monte Carlo, optimization), and several
integration routines for accurate and fast solution of even
&ldquo;stiff&rdquo; problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262e608"></a>Example Problem</h2></div></div><p>To give the uninitiated some idea of the input data required
to accommodate a simple but practical problem, consider the
electrical schematic of the Darlington pair in Figure 1. The
SCEPTRE version of the circuit appears in Figure 2 with the
assumption that a transistor equivalent circuit named 2N706A has
been stored in the model library at some previous time.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3008f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. SCEPTRE Form of Darlington Pair
</p></div></div><p>The problem is to determine the output voltages across R3 and
R4 and the power requirements of this circuit under nominal
conditions and after the current gain of the first-stage transistor
has been degraded to various levels. Defined Parameters will be
used to calculate the power consumption (PEC, PEIN). The rerun
feature accommodates the additional runs required for the degraded
alpha version (P1T1). The SCEPTRE input is shown in Listing
1.</p><p><a href="3008l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. SCEPTRE
Input</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x262eb88"></a>SCEPTRE Use</h2></div></div><p>This section describes the preparation of circuits and the
basics of the circuit description language for better understanding
of the examples.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Circuit Preparation</b></span></p><p>Assuming the user wants to analyse an electric circuit, the
following steps should be considered:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Draw an equivalent circuit consisting of resistors,
capacitors, inductors, mutual inductances, voltage sources, current
sources or models containing these elements. All of these elements
may be linear or nonlinear.</p></li><li><p>Assign to each node an arbitrary alphanumeric
name.</p></li><li><p>Give each element in the circuit a unique name,
where the first character classifies the component according to
Table 1.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="3008t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Choose a consistent set of parameter units. SCEPTRE
assumes no set of units for the element values. It operates
directly on the numbers supplied by the user. For numerical
reasons, users should select a set of units so that the voltage and
current responses expected in the solution are as close to unity as
possible. A consistent set of units is one which satisfies the
following equations simultaneously: U = I R, t = R C = L/R.</p></li><li><p>Choose an arbitrary current flow in each passive
circuit element, indicate the direction of positive current flow in
each current source and voltage source.</p></li></ul></div><p>SCEPTRE statements are entered under major headings and
subheadings. The most important headings used are the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MODEL DESCRIPTION
CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
  ELEMENTS
  DEFINED PARAMETERS
  OUTPUTS
  FUNCTIONS
RERUN DESCRIPTION
END
</pre><p>The actual problem is described under the major heading
<b  >CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION</b>. For the temporary
definition or permanent storage of models, the corresponding input
data go under the heading <b  >MODEL DESCRIPTION</b>. The
<b  >RERUN DESCRIPTION</b> heading is always used
whenever the rerun feature is exercised. All changes to the master
network must appear under this heading.</p><p>The network topology of a circuit must be written under the
subheading <b  >ELEMENTS</b> in the general form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>element</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>fromnode</em></span> - <span   class="emphasis"><em>tonode</em></span> = <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>
</pre><p>in case of mutual inductances:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>M</em></span>..., <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lname1</em></span> - <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lname2</em></span> = <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> may be a number, defined parameter,
reference to a table, mathematical expression using any intrinsic
FORTRAN function, reference to a statement function or user-defined
FORTRAN function.</p><p>Controlled sources (<b  >E</b>...,
<b  >J</b>...) may depend on any circuit quantity
(linearly dependent sources). Mainly for the analysis of
semiconductor devices, current sources may depend on diode tables
or built-in diode equations (primary dependent current sources) or
even on other primary dependent current sources (secondary
dependent current sources). In this way, the simulation is carried
out in a cost-effective manner. SCEPTRE determines the correct
sequence for the circuit calculation to avoid computational delays
normally introduced by these nonlinearities. The controlled sources
will run in an AC analysis without modification.</p><p>For the Monte Carlo, worst-case and optimization
calculations, resistors and sources may be provided by
bounds.</p><p>Mathematical expressions are entered in two ways. The direct
way has the general form</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>mathematical_definition</em></span>)
</pre><p>and is preferred when handling an equation, which is used
only by a single reference. Using the mathematical sequence for
several purposes, the equation form</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Q <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>par1</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>par2</em></span>, ... ) = ( ... )
</pre><p>is the more efficient way. It serves as a statement function and
must be entered under the subheading <b  >FUNCTIONS</b>.
</p><p>The same subheading holds the table entries. Data are entered
as point pairs with the independent variable in increasing
algebraic order. To produce step functions, it is permissible to
supply two consecutive independent-variable values that are equal
but have different dependent-variable values.</p><p>Reference to an element voltage and element current is
accomplished by prefixing the element name with the single
character <b  >V</b> and <b  >I</b>,
respectively. These references may be used as output variables
under the subheading <b  >OUTPUTS</b>, expressions,
equations, tables and defined parameters. One of the most powerful
features in SCEPTRE is the user-defined parameters under the
subheading <b  >DEFINED PARAMETERS</b>. The general form
is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
P <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> = <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>
</pre><p>where value denotes the possible entries mentioned before. If
the user specifies the time derivative</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DP <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>  = <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span>
</pre><p>SCEPTRE calculates the integral:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
P <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> = &ograve; DP <span   class="emphasis"><em>name  dt</em></span>
</pre><p>This allows the solution of simultaneous differential equations,
which need not be coupled to any network quantity. By canonical
substitution, transfer functions to any order can be evaluated.
Thus, the subheading <b  >ELEMENTS</b> is not mandatory.
For the AC analysis, the defined parameters may be complex-valued.</p><p>A variety of run controls can be entered under the subheading
<b  >RUN CONTROLS</b> and used to control the simulation
to a fine degree.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Simulation</b></span></p><p>The simulation is carried out in two phases. In the first
phase, SCEPTRE analyses the input data and, if the input statements
are free of errors, generates the appropriate FORTRAN subroutines
which solve the network equations. In the second phase, these
subroutines are compiled and linked with modules from the SCEPTRE
library and eventually with user-defined routines. Finally, the
binary to be executed contains only those modules needed by the
actual problem. Moreover, the working buffers are dimensioned
accordingly.</p><p>During execution, the actual simulation time (or frequency in
the AC analysis) with the requested output quantities is monitored
(no graphics), but may be suppressed to considerably speed up the
simulation. The results are written into a direct access
file.</p><p>A postprocessor called NGP is available, which reads the
direct access file and enables the user to select the requested
quantities. NGP then calls GNUPLOT for the final graphical
representation.</p><p>Despite its apparent complexity, to get full use of SCEPTRE,
only a text editor is needed along with two system commands to
start the simulation and the postprocessing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Program Organization</b></span></p><p>It was the intention of the author to keep the organization
of SCEPTRE as simple as possible without losing its power. The
shell scripts for SCEPTRE and NGP, which control the flow of all
actions, are kept simple, allowing the user to modify them
according to his requirements. NGP comes with the source code.
Thus, it is possible to adapt NGP to graphic software other than
GNUPLOT. Moreover, the monitoring interface routine, which is
called after each time or frequency step, is also available as
source and may be modified for on-line graphics.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Requirements and Availability</b></span></p><p>The version of SCEPTRE now available runs under any Linux
kernel. It needs a FORTRAN compiler and GNUPLOT. The X11 Window
System is not required. The binaries of SCEPTRE, including
libraries, NGP (source), auxiliary routines (source), English and
German documentation and a set of examples are available at
ftp://novilux.fh-friedberg.de/pub/sceptre_linux. The archive also
contains a suitable GNUPLOT version and a FORTRAN compiler.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28c70"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>SCEPTRE was originally developed by IBM Federal Systems
Division, Owego, New York, for the Air Force Weapons Laboratory,
Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, in 1966 (see Resources 1-5). The
development was assumed by GTE Sylvania, Waltham, Mass., in 1972.
The program could be obtained from AFWL for certain
mainframes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2536580.0x2a28d78"></a>Examples</h2></div></div><p>Typical applications for the use of SCEPTRE are circuits with
semiconductor devices. Equivalent circuits for these devices are
available with any desired complexity (see Resources 5-8).</p><p>To demonstrate the wide range of SCEPTRE applications, I will
present two examples from different areas. Other examples are
included with the listings in the file
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue63/3008.tgz.</p><p>1. High Voltage Impulse Generator</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3008f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Schematic of a Two-stage Marx-Surge Generator
</p></div></div><p>Voltage pulses of large amplitude are generated when
capacitors initially charged in parallel are series-connected with
the aid of spark gaps. Such a Marx-surge generator is illustrated
in Figure 3. For testing high voltage equipment, e.g., a power
transformer, the shape of the generated impulse must meet certain
requirements (rise and breakdown time). The shape is influenced
mainly by the resistors <b  >RE</b> and
<b  >RD</b>. To save computing time, the capacitors
<b  >CS</b> in stages 1 and 2 are initially charged via
<b  >INITIAL CONDITIONS</b> to the voltage of
<b  >EH</b> (making <b  >EH</b>
superfluous).</p><p>As the stages are identical, the <b  >MODEL
DESCRIPTION</b> is used and each stage is included with a
simple statement in the <b  >CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION</b>. To
avoid ambiguity of the element names in the main circuit, SCEPTRE
includes the model designation as a suffix (here S1 and S2) to the
component names. For simplicity, the spark is replaced by a
constant resistance <b  >RF</b>, but any other nonlinear
function may be applied. For this example, the set of units chosen
were <b  >kV, A, k omega</b>, nF, mH and
<b  >mu</b>s. The voltage at the capacitor
<b  >CB</b> is referred to as <b  >VCB</b> and
is shown in Figure 4. The SCEPTRE input is shown in Listing
2.</p><p><a href="3008l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Marx-Surge Generator

Figure 5. Rotating System with Two Degrees of Freedom, Electrical

freedom. Two bearings with polar moments of inertia
<b  >J_1</b> and <b  >J_2</b> and viscous
frictions <b  >c_1</b> and <b  >c_2</b> are
coupled through a shaft with a spring constant
<b  >k</b>. A driving torque <b  >M</b> is
applied to the left bearing. It is desirable to find the angular
velocities <b  >omega</b><b  >_1</b> and
<b  >omega</b><b  >_2</b> of the bearings and
the torque M_w on the shaft.</p><p>One approach is to derive directly the mechanical
relationship, which yields in the following differential equations
(see Resources 3):</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3008e1.jpg"></div><p>with the substitutions</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3008e2.jpg"></div><p>This set of equations can be entered directly under
<b  >DEFINED PARAMETERS</b>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3008t2.large.jpg"><img src="3008t2.jpg"></a></div><p>Another method for solving this problem is converting the
non-electrical system to its electrical analog as shown in Figure
5. The corresponding mechanical and electrical analogs for this
problem are shown in Table 2.</p><p><a href="3008l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Rotating System Input to

absolute error between the equivalent quantities

time for these quantities are shown in Figure 6. The absolute error

problems in a wide range of applications and is not limited to
electrical engineering. It produces solutions without requiring the

programming overhead, the problem to be solved is limited only by
the ingenuity and experience of the user.</p><p><a href="3008s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
