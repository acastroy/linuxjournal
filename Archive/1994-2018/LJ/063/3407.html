O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc., marks the third installment in an
emerging series by my favorite publisher. The CD-ROM contains a
complete copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX in a Nutshell: System V
Edition</em></span>; <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools, 2nd
Edition</em></span>; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the vi Editor</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>5th Edition</em></span>; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the UNIX
Operating System</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>4th Edition</em></span>;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sed and awk</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>2nd Edition</em></span>;
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Korn Shell</em></span>. These electronic
files are laid out in HTML format on the CD-ROM, making them easy
to read, navigate, share across local area networks and travel.
O'Reilly has also included all the software from <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX
Power Tools</em></span>, i.e., many useful utilities, shell scripts
and software.
</p><p>For those not familiar with these books, a brief summary
follows.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX in a Nutshell</em></span> is a
desktop quick reference outlining the fundamentals of many core
UNIX commands while touching on such topics as shell scripting,
pattern matching and text processing and editing.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span> is a
collection of articles containing tips and tricks for effective
UNIX usage. Organized into more than fifty topics,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UPT</em></span> also includes useful scripts and oodles of
pre-compiled open-source software.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the vi Editor</em></span> covers
the ins and outs of this popular editor and its pattern matching
and text replacement functions.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the UNIX Operating
System</em></span> provides a swift introduction to the art of UNIX
and includes tutorials on basic command use, redirection and
process management.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>sed and awk</em></span> focuses on the
usage of these two powerful text processing utilities and provides
practical examples of their use.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Korn Shell</em></span>
introduces the fundamentals of the Korn shell as both a user
environment and a scripting language, while expanding on many UNIX
basics.</p></li></ul></div><p>While the static pages of these books are exceedingly
valuable, the true power of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Bookshelf</em></span> is
unleashed with the included search facility, which makes every book
searchable, allowing users to quickly mine information from some of
O'Reilly's top titles. Want to know how to copy files using
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>? Merely enter
<b  >tar</b> and <b  >copy</b> into the
convenient index page, and the article &ldquo;Copying Directory Trees
with tar&rdquo; from <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span> pops up.
</p><p>The included Java-powered search engine requires installation
of the Java run-time environment (JRE), which is conveniently
located on the CD. I did notice some minor glitches while using the
Java search facility. The Java searcher proved unreliable in
searching individual books, but worked flawlessly when milling
through the collective titles. Buyers might also find it a tad
frustrating that book titles are not returned as part of the
results when searching the entire set, making it harder to quickly
decide which article will be most relevant to the problem at
hand.</p><p>The setup of the JRE is straightforward and should be
workable by even a UNIX novice. If you cannot make heads or tails
of the README file included with the tar archive file or the
hassle-free install script, an HTML page (included on the CD and
linked from the main index page) includes help for those who need a
little push. JRE binaries are included for Linux (libc5 and glibc),
Solaris (x86 and Intel), FreeBSD, SunOS and HP/UX. A polite note on
the help pages indicates that AIX, Digital UNIX and SCO UNIX
binaries could not be included because of licensing issues, but a
working link to more information on getting the JRE for any of
these architectures, and many others, is provided. Power users
might consider using an alternate method to search through the
electronic texts. I was able to easily index the lot with
<span   class="bold"><b>htdig</b></span>. Similar effects could be
produced with many other free packages, making the Java annoyances
no excuse for passing over this formidable ensemble.</p><p>As if the collective texts of these invaluable books coupled
with a search facility was not enough, a print copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX in a Nutshell</em></span> is also included.
Unfortunately, it has not been revised for this release, other than
some changes to its artwork and layout. While the included 1994
edition is still wonderfully helpful as a reference book, a more
up-to-date revision would have been welcome. This will undoubtedly
make many Linux users go running for man pages or a copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> instead. It would also
have been nice to include the 6th edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the
vi Editor</em></span>, rather than the outdated 5th edition which
does not include any of the long-awaited chapters on vi clones.
GNU/Emacs users might also find it a tad offensive that they have
been usurped here.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The UNIX CD Bookshelf</em></span> is a must for any
UNIX beginner who hasn't been previously exposed to the usefulness
of these wonderful books. It makes for a verbose yet portable UNIX
desk reference that will surely save UNIX users hours of time. At
$69.95, it is also a bargain compared to the aggregate price of the
individual titles. Expert users who own most of these titles might
want to think twice before shelling out the cash for this bundle,
although it would make a serious asset to any consultant on the
road. The power of searching through these UNIX titles can save
even veterans from many headaches. Looking down the &ldquo;CD
Bookshelf&rdquo; road with future releases including <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Networking CD Bookshelf</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Perl CD
Bookshelf</em></span>, I wonder when we'll see an O'Reilly
compendium on DVD-ROM.</p></div></div>
