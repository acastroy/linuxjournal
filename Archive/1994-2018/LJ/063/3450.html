    The average Joe wants something for nothing, and Mr. Hughes
    wants to give it to him.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd10580.0xe084a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I paid for my university education, in
that I paid an institution for access to its faculty and for use of
its facilities. The knowledge was free; all I had to do was take
advantage of the fact that it was there for the learning. I've told
many people about things I learned in school. I didn't need to pay
a license fee to tell other people about Hamiltonian mechanics or
G&ouml;del incompleteness. The academics who created this body of
knowledge published papers and gave away their knowledge. As far as
I'm concerned, I got something for nothing from them.
</p><p>Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction and
thereby paved the way for the electricity and electronics industry.
The value he captured from this development was nowhere near all
the value he created for everyone else. Such was his station in
life. He made the choice to freely give his time to the advancement
of science. Many others have followed his example, but nowhere near
a majority. Yet this tiny fraction of people has exerted a
significant, disproportional change on the world. Such is the fate
of certain knowledge workers. Get used to it.</p><p>On first blush, software appears to follow this academic
pathway. Yet software has users, who must find the software useful
to keep it. Researchers do not have to make their output useful,
just accurate, novel and potentially useful. To wit, researchers
don't have to do market research. Clearly, software developers
don't think they have to understand their users. Developers need to
understand their users only when they expect to have users.</p><p>The distribution of software clearly follows the model of
academic knowledge&mdash;create it once for free, then make the user pay
for its distribution. Yet the creation of software does not mirror
the creation of knowledge quite so accurately. The principle of
&ldquo;academic freedom&rdquo; is about as antithetical to the principle of
&ldquo;attaining user benefit&rdquo; as possible. The two just don't fit and
can't. The university never had a monopoly on creating
knowledge&mdash;or on developing free software&mdash;and it never will. The
university, however, does embody the understanding that some
development requires nurturing that cannot be easily obtained
elsewhere. Software development has no such analogous institutions,
and it needs one that is not the university.</p><p>This new institution should be a non-profit, tax-exempt
corporation especially created to pay for the design, construction
and delivery of public software. Let's be obvious about this:
giving away software for free is about as close as possible to the
center of the charitable purpose requirement of a tax-exempt
company. Like the university, the staff&mdash;no, let us call them the
talent&mdash;the talent working at this institution are not motivated by
dreams of entrepreneurial riches, but by the advancement of the
craft. The talent needs to come from a wide variety of disciplines,
essentially all that are present at a for-profit software company.
This new institution will always be in competition with commercial
interests for talent, so it will have to pay for talent
accordingly. Talent gets paid, the institution creates some
well-needed feeling of solidity, and regular folks get free
software.</p><p>&ldquo;Public software&rdquo; is any software that people can obtain
and use without any entanglement with intellectual property issues.
Public software also denotes the ubiquity of the software and the
corresponding expectation that people encounter it frequently. Some
open-source software is public software, some is not. Public
software is a concept rooted in the nature of its end use, not in
the means of creating it. All the wrangling over license terms for
derivative works has obscured the obvious point that the license is
in service of some goal; if you don't name your goal, you can't
possibly attain it. I know what my goal is&mdash;it is free beer.</p><p>I still can't figure out how the claim that the GNU Public
License encourages free speech is not utterly disingenuous. The GPL
is the opposite of free speech; it's a highly detailed copyright
agreement with the purpose of restricting the expression of
derivative works. If I can't keep an expression to myself, I am
restricted. All license agreements begin from the starting point of
complete restriction, that is, total prohibition against use, and
then work forward from that point. The summit of free speech is
public domain expression&mdash;if you want to speak it again, go ahead,
and for whatever purpose you care to seek. As much as I am an
advocate of free speech and all other civil rights, my purpose with
public software is not free speech&mdash;it's free beer.</p><p>The crucial reason the GPL has achieved such limited success
in scope is that its purpose is to benefit programmers who want
access to code, not to benefit outside customers. Whatever benefit
an outside customer gains is ancillary to the benefit to
programmers. This observation also explains why most GPL code is in
development tools and environments. To be blunt, the GPL is a
selfish contract for selfish purposes which cannot possibly be
generalized.</p><p>The open-source model, by contrast, is a technique in search
of goals. Open Source encompasses the goals of the GPL, and indeed
found some of its initial inspiration there. Yet Open Source also
encompasses other disparate goals, such as those for Mozilla. I
want to promote Open Source, but as part of my desire to promote
public software. My goal is compatible with Open Source, but I seek
Open Source not to promulgate its own merits, but as an enabler of
public software. Indeed, I fear sometimes that the Open Source
movement may fall to the hazard that is the core selfishness of the
GPL. In an attempt to seek openness, its promoters may forget that,
whatever benefit they derive from access to code, they must place
benefits to users first. By avoiding that hazard, I am confident
good results will come from the hubbub of activity surrounding Open
Source. I wish them well, but their effort is not identical to
mine. My effort is toward public software.</p><p>The natural venue for the release of public software is the
new institution. The value of any software derives in large part
from the solidity and gravity of the organization that creates it.
Ferreting out those expectations about the future which affect the
net present use value of software is another essay. Let me observe,
without justification, that people overwhelmingly prefer code that
is stable, architecture that is well-designed, products that can be
repaired and upgraded, and companies that will endure. Most people
lack the means to evaluate technical merit in software. Even more
people prefer to do things other than evaluate software. For almost
everybody, one's expectations about the institution stand in as a
proxy for all that thinking. Since I want public software to become
ubiquitous, I want the new institution to ship product.</p><p>I have not yet mentioned sustainability of the new
institution, because concerns about sustainability are concerns
about means, not about goals. A coherent and organizing focus on
what needs to be accomplished has been lacking; instead, we have
had endless fretting about how to do it&mdash;whatever this &ldquo;it&rdquo; is.
For all of its faults, at least Richard Stallman elucidated a clear
goal for the GPL: &ldquo;Make all source code everywhere usable by me
personally.&rdquo; A selfish goal, but at least it roused the mutually
self-interested to action. I cannot name another general goal that
has inspired more coherent effort in this area. There has been much
agreement about techniques, but I have seen no successor&mdash;in
goals&mdash;to the free software manifesto and the GPL.</p><p>Nor do I want a single successor. I want to see many
inspirations for creative technical work. Some may overlap; some
may conflict&mdash;this is of no matter. I want to see manifestos that
exult in the clarity of their vision. I want to see new approaches
conceived in the understanding of the obstacles to victory. Here,
for example, is one such possible goal for Linux:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I want Linux to be the only conceivable choice
for every commercial and personal use of operating systems. I want
universal device support, instant installation, zero administration
and a completely correct implementation.</p></blockquote></div><p>We will know we have succeeded when Microsoft's market
capitalization suddenly drops to exactly its cash balance.
</p><p>No institution can survive on a single goal, for when that
goal is accomplished, the purpose of the institution fades. The
life spring of an institution, that whence all material support
arises, is the stream of specific purposes that passes through it.
Universities achieve this with tenure and academic freedom. The new
institution, for its existence and its continuation, requires this
same kind of stream of purposes. I want software for nothing; thus
I require cooperation with others.</p><p>Given my goal of just-use-it-ware, I propose the means of a
new institution. As a means to a means, we now have to examine the
grungy underbelly of institutional sustainability. Or, to wit, who
pays? If you grant the desirability of the goal (no-fee software)
and the usefulness of the means (the new institution), then we need
not become spooked when we discover sustainability is hard. Once we
know our goal, we may persevere in seeking it and not be distracted
by less attractive or undesirable goals.</p><p>The first, almost too-obvious place to look for resources is
the existing network of public and government money that funds such
non-profit endeavors as public broadcasting and particle
accelerators. No one can do this alone. Who would give a few
million dollars to a hastily organized bunch of technical guys who
look suspiciously like the &ldquo;Hacker Development Environment
League&rdquo;? If the point of the institution is software that benefits
the public directly as a whole (and not indirectly, with
compilers), then we need representatives on the board who are
believable and legitimate to the various constituencies who might
provide funding. That means people outside the computer
industry.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, the university takes one-third of each
grant to support the institution. This is simply the necessary
overhead to have an institution and not just a group of
researchers. Rather than worrying about the shibboleth of
&ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; of the grant allocation, accept that the very
existence of the institution is of separate efficacy. The
institution creates value&mdash;value in solidity, value in stability,
value in longevity&mdash;that individuals and informal groups can never
provide. The total value of software is far more than the actual
running code. Software of uncertain provenance and indeterminate
future is mostly worthless. If you disbelieve this, go look at
market share estimates. Put an institution behind that same code
and it suddenly becomes valuable. To be generous, maybe one-quarter
of the total value of software comes from the product. We can get
the other three-quarters value from an institution and pay for the
institution with only half the money we spend directly on talent.
Still worried about efficiency? Three times the value for half the
money, and institutional maintenance is looking six times more
productive than the talent.</p><p>It's not that the developers are unproductive. The mythos of
the hacker community rests in the power of a small number of
programmers to change the world. When put this way, the effort is
discrete and the change is instantaneous. In other words, the
formulation is one of magic, not of economics. Extensive change
comes only from sustained effort by numerous people with aligned
goals. Unless there are people who nurture the project without
interruption, these efforts at change wither and become of no
consequence. Those who have set their lives around the mythos of
the magical coder urgently need assistance in completing their
work. I believe in this mythos. I do not identify it as magical in
order to kill it, but rather to feed it. The new institution I
advocate herein is a completion of the creative spark at the heart
of all good software.</p><p>The activity here is not merely inventing such mechanisms and
analyzing them, but also mounting experiments. The institution
needs fiscal solidity in order to have the confidence to attempt
new forms of support.</p><p>A first, concrete funding goal would be to build an endowment
fund. Rather than endowing a chair in which a single researcher
sits, I want to endow a table around which a release committee
shall meet. Here's a specific beginning goal for such a new
institution: a $25 million endowment for the Linux Release Table.
The residual investment income would be adequate for five members
of the table, two paid interns and two administrative staff
members, all full-time positions. This table would not do any
technical work, but would coordinate planning, architecture,
development and release. Now this table could not possibly
encompass the breadth of activity generated from a ubiquitous,
dominant Linux; clearly, more people and more money and more
structures would be necessary. Yet this first endowment could be
the seed of a full set of institutional structures surrounding
Linux.</p><p>The focus on endowed tables for release is one of the lessons
learned from the open-source world and from Java. Namely,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>who</em></span> matters more than
<span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span>--the party who releases new versions of a
product matters more than how the license terms read. The new
institution needs to focus strategically on branding and
compatibility as keystones to generating value for users. No matter
what the licenses for intellectual property are, the association of
the institution with the product is the critical element in
delivering the value of the institution. Branding is the
manifestation of this association and is the initial point of its
delivery. Compatibility prevents pollution of the brand and thereby
ensures its longevity. Trademark licensing enables control of the
brand and subsequent control over compatibility. Sun has
masterfully demonstrated with Java how to pull off this trick. How
much better if one of the new institutions had pulled it off
instead!</p><p>I have suggested a new institution; I also suggest a new idea
for an institution. A mature field of public software creation
could not subsist on a single organization of this new type. No
initial efforts in creating these new institutions should be taken
as an excuse to defer one's own effort away from building a
&ldquo;competing&rdquo; institution. The principle of the new institution is
public and cooperative, not singular and nepotistic. I should hope
for jockeying for position between institutions, only as a
convivial process of mutual betterment.</p><p>The average Joe wants something for nothing. With knowledge
and information, we can come as close as possible to this ideal.
Let the scarcity economists haggle over flesh. We won't appreciably
change GDP figures. The new institution is an exercise in abundance
economics. Free knowledge and information add untold real wealth to
the world. Let our revenge upon scarcity be that its limitation
upon wealth become miniscule.</p></div></div>
