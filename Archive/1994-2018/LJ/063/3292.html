    Farming is not a place one would expect to fine Linux, but
    there it is. Mr. Haverland tells us how Linux is used in
    this unusual area.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a732f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ideally, precision farming is a process
where one manages the production of a crop on a plant-by-plant
basis. Practically speaking, we are not yet at that level of
resolution, but we are beyond treating an entire field as one
homogeneous unit.
</p><p>Modern electronics, global positioning satellites, signal
processing and a host of other technologies make precision farming
possible. The driving forces for development and acceptance are the
possibility of increased profitability and the realization of
improved stewardship of the land (less pollution, optimal use of
chemical inputs, etc.).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a73450"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Precision farming is evolving around three technologies:
global positioning (GPS), geostatistics (GIS) and remote sensing.
Other developed technologies such as sampling, soil analysis and
others are also playing a role.</p><p>Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has been in
the Precision Farming business since 1993. We work with selected
farmers across the province who grow a variety of crops: wheat,
barley, canola, peas, potatoes, etc. Our objectives are the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Help develop a workable system that interested
farmers can implement on their farms.</p></li><li><p>Transfer this technology to private
industry.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Global Positioning</b></span>
</p><p>Global positioning satellites and receivers were the
technologies that started this revolution in agriculture (see
Resources). Before then, positioning via radio was possible, but
not very accessible to the researcher, or ultimately the
farmer.</p><p>Two families of global positioning satellites are in orbit
around the earth: Navstar (U.S. system) and Glonass (Russian). The
Navstar system is capable of better positioning than the Glonass
system. However, the US military uses something called &ldquo;selective
availability&rdquo; to decrease precision to something on the order of
100 meters (unless one is using military GPS receivers).
Agricultural applications require positioning at sub-meter
precisions, most often in real time.</p><p>Some enterprising person realized if a GPS receiver were put
over some known position, a correction to the position as
determined by GPS could be calculated. This correction factor could
then be applied to nearby (in space and time) GPS positions. How
good the correction is depends on how close the roving receiver is
to the fixed known station, and how long ago the correction was
calculated. The best precision I am familiar with is typically on
the order of 10cm. However, due to the changing &ldquo;constellation&rdquo;
of GPS satellites, we can't always get precision this good.</p><p>For most people, it is not practical to own two GPS receivers
plus radio-modems to gather positioning information. For 20cm
precision, this type of setup costs on the order of $20,000 US.
Fortunately, it is possible for many people to obtain usable
differential corrections without going to the trouble of owning a
differential base station. There are a number of sources of
differential corrections and means of receiving them. Some
corrections are broadcast over FM radio, some on other frequencies
and some from satellite. The Coast Guard has a number of DGPS
(differential GPS) beacons along navigable waterways and
coastlines. This includes locations such as the Mississippi and
Missouri River basins and the Great Lakes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Geostatistics</b></span></p><p>One of the most important factors in precision farming, is
the ability to store, display and manipulate geo-referenced
information. On a local scale, geostatistical packages can look
something like a spreadsheet (raster) or a CAD (vector) package.
Some types of information access work better in the raster model,
some in the vector model.</p><p>Agriculture is one of the smaller users of GIS packages;
therefore, it is necessary to bend the analytical techniques to
methods developed for other applications. The unavailability of
theoretical models also affects what can be done with an
analysis.</p><p>A couple of &ldquo;free&rdquo; GIS packages are available, but by far
the most comprehensive is the Geographical Resources Analysis
Support System (GRASS)
(<a href="http://www.baylor.edu/grass" target="_self">http://www.baylor.edu/grass/</a>).
This package was originally developed by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) and
extended by other government and university researchers and users
over the years. Active support by CERL has been abandoned, but was
recently taken up by Baylor University.</p><p>GRASS is now advertised as an &ldquo;Open GIS&rdquo;. Among the new
developments is an interface based on Tcl. An OpenGIS Consortium
(<a href="http://www.OpenGIS.org" target="_self">http://www.OpenGIS.org/</a>)
also exists.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Remote Sensing</b></span></p><p>Commercial satellite remote sensing (see Resources) typically
has a resolution on the order of 10m, each pixel covering an area
on the order of 100m (far worse than the (rumored?) 10cm resolution
the CIA has with some of its satellites). In order to statistically
detect some change in an image, many pixels in close proximity must
be significantly different than expected. With 10m pixels, this
means that many hundreds of square meters of land must be affected
before the change can be detected from space. For things like
disease or pests, this is not very useful, but it is acceptable for
crop maturity. To detect disease or pests, aircraft-based remote
sensing is presently required. In the near future, high-resolution
satellite imagery is expected to become commonplace.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a73d40"></a>Adventures in Analysis</h2></div></div><p>Precision farming is filled with analytical adventure.
Conventionally, precision farming starts with a map of crop yield
from the field. To acquire this map, we put a DGPS receiver on some
known location on the combine harvester, and a yield monitor
somewhere in the path grain takes from entering the header to the
clean grain tank. (The closer this is to the threshing part of the
combine, the shorter the throughput delay time.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Position Information</b></span></p><p>The DGPS antenna is fixed on some point on the combine
harvester, usually the cab roof. The grain is removed from the
field along the leading edge of the header, i.e., a line segment
remote from the point where the GPS antenna is. If we are
interested in only coarse resolutions, the difference between the
GPS receiver location on the leading edge of the combine header is
not important. At fine resolutions, we do need to make this
correction, and in order to make it, we need to know the
orientation of the vehicle in 3-D space. This information is not
currently collected&mdash;it must be calculated later.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Velocity Information</b></span></p><p>Combine harvesters typically move at about two meters per
second. With high accuracy DGPS equipment, errors are typically on
the order of 10cm. This results in velocities having errors on the
order of 10%. GPS position errors are highly correlated in time.
Events called &ldquo;blunders&rdquo; can occur, which result in relatively
huge position errors. Once a blunder has occurred, its presence may
live on for several seconds. This results in two huge velocity
errors on either end of a &ldquo;short&rdquo; track of biased position
estimates.</p><p>Combine harvesters usually operate under the conditions of
constant mass and wheel power traveling in straight lines. (This
means the position as a function of time must be twice continuously
differentiable. The only places where third and higher order
derivatives can exist are on corners. This information can be used
to help smooth the position information.) Therefore, we should be
able to use low-order polynomials or splines to smooth the position
as a function of time data.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)</b></span></p><p>If one assumes the vehicle is always traveling in a forward
direction and there is no side slip of the wheels, it is possible
to calculate the orientation of the vehicle in space. However, if
one has an available model of the elevation as a function of
position in the field, they can obtain a much better estimate of
the surface normal to the ground.</p><p>Stereo photography is one way to obtain a DEM. Another is to
start from GPS position information and correct it for the GPS
receiver mounting position and the vehicle's geometry and
orientation in space.</p><p>The DEM is quite useful, as landscape is one of the
contributing factors in crop yields. For example, during a wet
year, low-lying concave parts of the field are typically too wet to
produce good crops. Another example is lower yields on
high-elevation convex hilltops during dry years. The DEM is most
useful when it is interpreted with terrain analysis and combined
with crop yield and other data sets in a GIS. Sometimes (more often
than desired) precision farming requires new and specialized
procedures.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Yield Time Lags</b></span></p><p>Basically, the time it takes for the crop to travel from the
leading edge of the combine header to the yield sensor is not a
single, unique value. Some of the crop takes a relatively short
time, and some takes longer. This process smears and averages crop
yield over a period which is typically 25 seconds long.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a74370"></a>Linux and Open Source Software</h2></div></div><p>Linux is a good platform for doing this research-oriented
work. Much of the analysis can be translated into such mainstream
topics as signal processing or multi-dimensional statistics. Some
of the best software for exploring software in these topics is the
product of government and university research and is &ldquo;free&rdquo;--an
important quality in tight budgets. GRASS, xldlas and Santis are
three packages which have helped in precision farming.</p><p>Perl has also proven itself to be quite useful. Our
participation in precision farming has lasted six years now.
Several kinds of GPS equipment and yield monitors have been used,
even updates of individual systems. Of course, everybody has to
have his own &ldquo;standard&rdquo; data format. Our method of analyzing the
data evolves, which for us means re-analyzing the previous year's
data with the current best method. This results in many format
changes in data&mdash;an area where Perl excels. The ability to use
pseudo-ttys in Perl has been useful when it was necessary to change
coordinate systems on thousands of data points using GRASS
programs.</p><p>One area which has not seen a lot of development is the safe
storage of data. A farmer does not want to discover that the data
is not &ldquo;on the card&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> he has harvested
a crop&mdash;this has been known to happen. Using radio modems to
transmit the data to a home computer would be one way of avoiding
this situation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a74580"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Precision farming is here to stay. However, the data storage
and analysis needs of precision farming are beyond the resources of
most farmers. Procedures and analytical processes are not always
available in &ldquo;canned&rdquo; packages (certainly not in any one
package), so a powerful, open development environment is
needed.</p><p>If you are a person who understands the philosophy of
statistics and are academically inclined, precision farming might
be a very interesting topic/career in which to get involved.</p><p><a href="3292s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
