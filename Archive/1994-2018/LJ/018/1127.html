lot of documentation is required, not only for newcomers, but for
all users. Just think of all the FAQs, HOWTOs, manual pages, and
books everyone needs for their daily work. Some people want to read
these documents as plain ASCII text, while others want to read them
over the World Wide Web or print them on their PostScript printer.
It is possible to make an HTML version of an ASCII document for the
Web and a nicely-formated PostScript version for people to print,
but all the different formats have to be maintained separately.
This is theoretically possible, but doesn't happen in real life.
</p><p>We need a documentation system that can produce different
formats from a single source. The Linux Documentation Project faced
this exact dilemma when the HOWTO project was started, so Matt
Welsh wrote the Linuxdoc-SGML package to solve it. With this
package, all documentation is formatted in a similar way. But SGML
is very flexible, so you can use the system to write many different
kinds of documentation; as an example, the XFree86 project uses
Linuxdoc-SGML for all of its documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16a9580.0x17a1608"></a>A Linuxdoc-SGML Example</h2></div></div><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;article&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The Very Short Story
&lt;author&gt;A. Author
&lt;date&gt;1 Jan 1970
&lt;p&gt;
Once upon a time, they lived happily ever after.
&lt;article&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see here, the Linuxdoc-SGML syntax is very simple.
Commands are written in angle brackets:
<b  >&lt;command&gt;</b>. When they apply to a block of
the text they appear in a pair surrounding that block, so
<b  >&lt;/article&gt;</b> before the block is balanced by
<b  >&lt;/article&gt;</b> after the block. There is also
an abbreviation for the latter case if the block is short:
<b  >&lt;tt/typewriter font/</b>.</p><p>The first line of the document specifies the document type.
Here you will always specify <b  >linuxdoc system</b>,
since this refers to the main macros of the Linuxdoc-SGML package.
Then you start your document with the
<b  >&lt;article&gt;</b> command and close it at the end
with the corresponding &ldquo;article off&rdquo; command
<b  >&lt;/article&gt;</b>. The article itself starts with
the title, the author, and the date (which is optional). After that
you can start writing the body text. The
<b  >&lt;p&gt;</b> command indicates the beginning of the
first paragraph. You don't have to worry about spaces or line
breaks when writing the text, since multiple spaces between words
are ignored and line breaks are automatically inserted at the
appropriate positions. To begin a new paragraph, insert a blank
line, which is a &ldquo;synonym&rdquo; for <b  >&lt;p&gt;</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16a9580.0x17a1ad8"></a>Running Linuxdoc-SGML</h2></div></div><p>Linuxdoc-SGML is actually a collection of programs that work
together to provide the final output. You need to know how to use
each of them; several examples will help. The
<span   class="bold"><b>format</b></span> program creates files
designed for LaTeX, groff, or makeinfo, and is part of the process
of creating HTML files, which is explained more fully below. The
<b  >-T</b> argument tells
<span   class="bold"><b>format</b></span> which program it is writing
files for.</p><p>There is one utility for running each of the formatting
programs (groff, etc). Each has a name starting with &ldquo;q&rdquo;, like
&ldquo;qtex&rdquo;.</p><p>To get a PostScript file via LaTeX, just type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
format -T latex example.sgml &gt; example.tex
qtex example
</pre><p>and Linuxdoc-SGML will create a LaTeX-format file, use LaTeX
to process that file, then use
<span   class="bold"><b>dvips</b></span> to turn that into the
PostScript file example.ps. Note that you need to have LaTeX and
dvips installed, along with Linuxdoc-SGML, for this to work.</p><p>If you prefer a DVI file, you may use a <b  >-d</b>
switch with <b  >qtex</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
format -T latex example.sgml | qtex -d &gt; example.dvi
</pre><p>The plain ASCII output is created with a similar procedure.
Just run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
format -T nroff example.sgml | qroff &gt; example.txt
</pre><p>To get texinfo output that can be read with the GNU info
program, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
format -T info example.sgml
</pre><p>This will create the necessary files in the current directory
automatically. Of course, you need the GNU texinfo package
installed on your system to make texinfo files.</p><p>The HTML output needs a little bit more care, since two
compilation stages are necessary to get all cross references built.
First, you have to have the <b  >LINUXDOC</b> environment
variable set up correctly; you will want to put a line such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export LINUXDOC=~/linuxdoc-sgml-1.2
</pre><p>in your bash startup file, or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv LINUXDOC=~/linuxdoc-sgml-1.2
</pre><p>in your csh or tcsh startup file.</p><p>Once that is working, you have to run several commands to get
finished HTML:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
format -T html example.sgml | prehtml | \
   fixref &gt; tmp.html
format -T html example.sgml | prehtml &gt;&gt; tmp.html
cat tmp.html | html2html example &gt; example.html
rm tmp.html
</pre><p>It's a good idea to put these commands in a shell script
since you will call these commands often. Here's a simple version
you can use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bin/bash
bin/bash
# sgml2html
[ -z -$1- ] &amp;&amp; { echo -What file?-; exit 1 }
BASE=`basename $1 .sgml'
[ ! -f $BASE.sgml ] &amp;&amp; { echo -No file $BASE.sgml-; exit 2 }
TMP=$$tmp.html
format -T html $1 | prehtml | fixref &gt; $TMP
format -T html $1 | prehtml &gt;&gt; $TMP
cat $TMP | html2html $BASE &gt; $BASE.html
rm $TMP
</pre><p>This script requires that your input file has the extension
<b  >.sgml</b>.</p><p>This script must be given the full file name, and it requires
that the file have the extension <b  >.sgml</b> to work
correctly.</p><p>All of this is documented more completely in the excellent,
short manual provided with Linuxdoc-SGML.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16a9580.0x17a26e0"></a>The Details</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have explained the necessary &ldquo;overhead&rdquo;, we can
start writing larger documents. Therefore, you will probably want
to create sections and subsections, start the document with an
abstract, and insert a table of contents. You can just add the
following lines after the <b  >date</b> line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;abstract&gt;
Here is the abstract.
&lt;abstract&gt;
&lt;toc&gt;
&lt;sect&gt;The First Section
&lt;sect1&gt;The First Subsection
</pre><p>Depending on the output format you want to create, the table
of contents will have different styles: in a LaTeX document you get
a standard table of contents, and in an HTML file you will get a
list of cross references for the different sections and
subsections.</p><p>As you can see from our example, the
<b  >&lt;sect&gt;</b> command creates a new section and
the <b  >&lt;sect1&gt;</b> command a new subsection. You
can access five different levels simply by increasing the number in
the command name. Note that you will still have to insert the
<b  >&lt;p&gt;</b> command to start the first paragraph
after an sectioning command. For technical documentation it is
often necessary to include &ldquo;verbatim&rdquo; text&mdash;text that is passed
through without interpretation by the SGML parser. You can do this
with the <b  >&lt;verb&gt;</b> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;verb&gt;This text is not interpreted &lt;verb&gt;
</pre><p>However, some very special characters do need some additional
handling even when they appear inside a verbatim environment. For
example, the sequence of an opening angle bracket and a slash
(<b  >&lt;/</b>) has to be written as
<b  >&amp;ero;etago;</b>. The manual that comes with the
Linuxdoc-SGML package includes a list of all special characters and
the commands used to enter them as literal characters.</p><p>The Linuxdoc-SGML package supports three different font
styles beside the normal font: boldface, italics, and typewriter.
To select a font insert the command <b  >bf</b>,
<b  >em</b>, or <b  >tt</b>, respectively. To
switch back to the default font just use the corresponding
&ldquo;slashed&rdquo; command, as in the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
This &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt; is written in italics!
</pre><p>An abbreviated version of each of these is sometimes
useful:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
This &lt;em/text/ is written in italics!
</pre><p>Now let's take a look at different list types that are
supported:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b  >itemize</b> for bulleted
lists</p></li><li><p><b  >enum</b> for numbered lists,
and</p></li><li><p><b  >descrip</b> for description lists,
as demonstrated in this list.</p></li></ol></div><p>You just start the list &ldquo;environment&rdquo; with the
<b  >&lt;list&gt;</b> command and close it with
<b  >&lt;/list&gt;</b>. To produce a new item (either a
bullet or a number) you can use the <b  >&lt;item&gt;</b>
command. In the description environment, you have to use the
<b  >&lt;tag&gt;</b> command with an argument that
contains the &ldquo;keyword&rdquo;, as in the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;descrip&gt;
&lt;tag/First./ This is the first point.
&lt;tag&gt;Second.&lt;/tag&gt; And this is the second.
&lt;/descrip&gt;
</pre><p>If you want to create WWW pages with this package, you may
want to create cross references to other WWW pages. This is done
with the <b  >&lt;url&gt;</b> command, as in the
following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;url url=-http://gnus.com/pub/text.html- name=-Text
document-&gt;
</pre><p>This creates a link to the WWW page
<b  >text.html</b> on the specified host and displays
<b  >Text document</b> as the title of the link. When you
create non-HTML documents, both the name and the URL are shown, so
that the reader can still find the document.</p></div></div>
