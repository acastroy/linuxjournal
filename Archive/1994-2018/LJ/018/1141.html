Wide Web get is that much net information feels very
do-it-yourself. Is that good or bad? Some argue that all this
volunteer information erodes the difference between the work of
casual amateurs and the truly authoritative. Others contend that
making this judgement has always been the responsibility of the
reader, regardless of the medium, and the explosion of content on
the Internet just makes more voices available to choose among. The
Internet's detractors seem to be in the minority (although that
doesn't diminish their arguments), and they can't stop Web serving
from being a ton of fun. So we find many books on the market these
days to help us do-it-yourself publishers. I recently had the
pleasure of working with three.</p><p>Of these books, Morris's <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML for Fun and
Profit</em></span> is the only one that gives evidence of having
been rushed to press (and it still missed its intended publication
date by several weeks). The book has many distracting typos as well
as a few truly embarrassing errors&mdash;for example, it's regrettable
that Garrison Keillor has not read <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML for Fun and
Profit</em></span>, because it alleges that gopher originated at the
University of Michigan. He should be able to get a good monologue
out of that, on the topic of &ldquo;Yet More Indignities Minnesota
Suffers&mdash;Stoically, of Course.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML for Fun and Profit</em></span> has the feel of
a reference manual, with all the pros and cons that might suggest.
It has many tables, and you probably won't come away from the book
with the feeling that you're missing raw data.... Most of what Web
authors and managers use most of the time is covered, with the
exception of post-HTML 2.0 extensions. On the other hand, the prose
is wooden, which makes for slow reading, and the onslaught of
detail after detail creates a trees-obscuring-the-forest effect.
Morris's book is the only one of the three that comes with a
CD-ROM, which in this case offers 500MB of the same stuff over and
over again. The disc's top-level directory structure offers &ldquo;mac&rdquo;,
&ldquo;WINNT&rdquo;, &ldquo;sol1&rdquo;, &ldquo;sol2&rdquo;, and disappointingly slim &ldquo;docs&rdquo; and &ldquo;src&rdquo;
directories. The directories named after architectures contain
binaries for the platforms and all the examples from the book,
mostly identical among the various architectures. (&ldquo;sol1&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sol2&rdquo; are SunOS and Solaris 2, respectively.) Can ISO 9660 CD-ROMs
have hard links? This one doesn't, and they might have made some
room for the things we'd like to see on a Web CD-ROM, like maybe
giftrans, which the text itself spends more than one page
documenting. So what's here for Linux users? Well, all the text
examples are here, though most are pretty trivial; source code for
the CERN and NCSA servers is here; and there's source for Perl 4.
No selection of Web browsers, no pbmplus, no xv, no giftrans. I was
disappointed with the CD-ROM, as well as the book as a whole.
Neither really connects the reader with the day-to-day experience
of running a Web site.</p><p>By contrast, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web Site</em></span> is
pervaded by experience. You sense on every page that you are being
addressed by people who have worked long and hard with what they
are discussing. For example, all the books mention that it is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>faux pas</em></span> to use &ldquo;click here&rdquo; as a hyperlink,
but only this book bothers to give credible reasons why. Only in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web Site</em></span> will you find the magic
incantation <b  >telnet <i><tt>hostname</tt></i>
80</b>, the canonical way to test whether your Web server is
happy. And only <span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web Site</em></span> explains why
you should care about your server logs.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web Site</em></span> includes the
specifications for HTTP, HTML, and URLs, which the cynical might
assume were included so that the book would take up more shelf
space than its competitors at Bookstar. But the authors have taken
pains to insert cross-references into the specs, a nice gesture,
and I found myself using the specs regularly.</p><p>One odd omission from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web Site</em></span>
is server-parsed HTML, a topic covered very nicely in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
HTML Sourcebook</em></span>. This book's focus is narrower than the
others'; its intent is primarily to describe the world of Web
authoring. It contains a section on Web servers, many of which are
non-Unix, but the presentation is broad rather than deep.
Interestingly enough, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sourcebook</em></span> displays
a simple C program that pretends to be a Web server and displays
what a client is sending. The program feels out of place, but it's
useful nevertheless.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sourcebook</em></span> also contains voluminous
lists of tools, all with URLs for getting them. Since any paper
guide to the Internet is going to be out of date the moment it hits
the stands, these locations must be taken with a grain of salt, but
you can at least use the locations as hints for archie use. Perhaps
knowing this, the author included a section on how to use
archie&mdash;although he assumes that you will be willing and able to
install an archie client rather than telnetting to an archie server
directly.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The HTML Sourcebook</em></span> is the only book of
the three to emphasize that the Web's native character set is ISO
Latin-1, not ASCII. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web Site</em></span> ignores
the issue (except in the included HTML spec), and <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML
for Fun and Profit</em></span> makes a muddle of the whole issue.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The HTML Sourcebook</em></span> is also the only one that
mentions Linux.</p><p>Another strength of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sourcebook</em></span> is
that it demonstrates by example the importance of previewing your
Web content with a range of browsers, and the book includes the
archive locations of many. Web authors often forget to do this test
before releasing their material, so it's nice to see the word
getting out; I wish Graham had been even more explicit. In fact, my
favorite single page in any of these books is in <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML for
Fun and Profit</em></span>: it shows a Web home page whose authors
neglected the possibility that visitors might have chosen to delay
the loading of inline images. It's a train wreck, of course, and
all the more satisfying because the page belongs to Sun.</p><p>Of these books, I recommend <span   class="emphasis"><em>Build a Web
Site</em></span> for Linux audiences, possibly supplemented by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The HTML Sourcebook</em></span> for finding resources.
Perhaps <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML for Fun and Profit</em></span> will be
improved in future editions. I also recommend that anyone
contemplating Web work learn perl, perhaps before reading these
books.</p></div></div>
