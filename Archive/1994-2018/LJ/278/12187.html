Jetico's BestCrypt Container Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
Cyber-attacks are now constant, threats to privacy are increasing, and more rigid
regulations are looming worldwide. To help IT folks relax in the face of these
challenges, Jetico updated its BestCrypt Container Encryption solution to include
Container Guard. This unique feature of Jetico's Linux file encryption
protects container files from unauthorized or accidental commands&mdash;like copying,
modification, moving, deletion and re-encryption&mdash;resulting in bolstered
security and more peace of mind. Only users with the admin password can disable
Container Guard, increasing the security of sensitive files. The BestCrypt update
also adds the Resident feature, an automatic password prompt for mounting
containers at startup. That same feature will dismount containers after a time
period of inactivity as set by the user. While user-friendly and time-saving,
these added features also provide an extra layer of protection when working on
shared computers. On endpoints or in the cloud, data encrypted with BestCrypt can
be accessed via Linux, Android, Windows and Mac devices.

BlueCat DNS Edge</h2></div></div><p>
Migration to the cloud, the flexibility of network virtualization and the promise
of IoT involve IT transformations that have placed incredible strain on enterprise
security. To identify, assess and block threats proactively in this milieu,
BlueCat has developed BlueCat DNS Edge, a first-of-its-kind solution that uniquely
leverages DNS data to enhance enterprise security. By driving policy down to DNS
control points inside the network, BlueCat DNS Edge leverages the ubiquity of DNS
to gain enterprise-wide visibility into the actions of every device on a network,
including non-traditional devices, such as wireless security cameras, point-of-sale
systems, ATMs and IoT devices. Deployed inside the network, DNS Edge control
points identify suspicious internal behavior, patterns and threats, regardless of
whether the device is communicating inside or outside the network. BlueCat DNS
Edge is promoted as the first DNS security solution with the flexibility to deploy
anywhere businesses need it&mdash;on premises, in the cloud and as a core part of
IoT architectures. BlueCat DNS Edge's simple, cloud-managed deployment model
leverages existing DNS infrastructure, enabling organizations to deploy with no
impact to existing infrastructure while driving resilience and reducing latency.
Delivered as a service, BlueCat DNS Edge dynamically scales to meet anticipated
and unanticipated spikes in network activity, such as seasonal activity or a
sudden attack against enterprise infrastructure.

ONF/ON.Lab's ONOS Project</h2></div></div><p>
Networks have become indispensable infrastructure in modern society. The danger is
that these networks tend to be closed, proprietary, complex, operationally
expensive and inflexible, all of which impede innovation and progress rather than
enabling them. Presenting an alternative vision&mdash;that networking can serve the
public interest&mdash;is the Open Network Operating Sytem, or ONOS Project. ONOS is an
open-source, software-defined networking (SDN) OS for service providers that has
scalability, high availability, high performance and abstractions to simplify
creation of apps and services. The platform is based on a solid architecture and
quickly has matured to be feature-rich and production-ready. Recently ONF/ON.Lab
announced availability of a new ONOS release that broadens the ability to bring
SDN and NFV agility to mission-critical networks. By adding support for
&ldquo;incremental SDN&rdquo; alongside the &ldquo;disruptive SDN&rdquo; capabilities for
which it long has been known, ONOS now can address an ever-wider array of
deployment scenarios. Additional enhancements include an improved whitebox
leaf-spine fabric solution to support IPv6 routing, vLAN tagged external
interfaces and AAA endpoint authentication, as well as an enhanced GUI v2.0 that
improves usability on large-scale networks by providing regional topology views
with drill-down, context-sensitive help and global search, among others.

Linux Lite</h2></div></div><p>
Linux Lite is a beginner-friendly Linux distribution that is based on the
well known Ubuntu LTS and targeted at Windows users. Its mission is to provide a
complete set of applications to support users' everyday computing needs,
including a complete office suite, media players and other essential applications.
The new version, Linux Lite 3.4, simplifies scheduling of software updates,
installing third-party drivers and creating a restore point for the OS. Meanwhile,
the new Lite Updates Notify application informs the user of all available updates.
Users can set update reminders anywhere from once every hour to every three weeks. The
updated Lite Welcome has a fresh new look and reminds users to install updates and
drivers and sets a restore point after a fresh install of Linux Lite. Other new
features in Lite Tweaks include Hibernate &amp; Suspend, Login &amp; Logout options,
Manage Saved Sessions and zRam. zRam is a compressed RAM block device for faster
I/O and is perfect for older computers.

SUSE CaaS Platform</h2></div></div><p>
There are a lot of decisions to be made before enterprises are ready for
production and deployment of container apps, asserts SUSE. To help enterprises derive
full value from containerized apps and not &ldquo;re-create the wheel&rdquo;, the SUSE
engineering team is busy creating the next-generation application development and
hosting platform for container applications and services. The novel SUSE Container
as a Service (CaaS) Platform is an application development and hosting platform
for container applications and services that lets users provision, manage and
scale container-based applications and services, letting them focus on development
of container applications to meet business goals faster while reducing costs in
developing and maintaining container infrastructure. SUSE CaaS Platform comes with
the following ingredients: a tasty new flavor of SUSE Linux Enterprise&mdash;container host OS called SLE MicroOS, a good dose of Kubernetes, a pinch of Salt
and more special ingredients.

J. and K. Fidler's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cut the Cord, Ditch the Dish, and Take Back Control of
Your TV</em></span> (Iron Violin Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Prospective TV cable-cutters, even those with technical abilities, often
are flummoxed in the face of choosing between all of the content options and new
technologies available. Reliable sources of complete and neutral information in
this space are hard to find, and the fun evaporates rapidly when you're faced
with hours of stumbling through forums and strings of searches. A quicker route to
TV nirvana is to read J. and K. Fidler's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cut the Cord,
Ditch the Dish, and Take Back Control of Your TV</em></span> from Iron Violin Press. Subtitled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Fun, Tried-and-Tested, and Absolutely Legit Ways to Customize, Control and
Change How You Watch TV</em></span>, the Fidler team's book is a &ldquo;time-saving,
easily understood, roadmap for readers of all technical levels to be able to have
fun, save money, and get the content and TV experience they want&rdquo;. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cut
the Cord</em></span> provides &ldquo;been-there-done-that&rdquo; tips and explores the new
technologies now available to cord-cutters. The nearly 400-page ebook gives basic
information needed to get started, then builds on this knowledge to document a
variety of simple to advanced DIY projects. One of those projects includes
creating a DIY Linux OS-based DVR using MythTV and an Intel NUC.

eCosCentric Limited's eCosPro</h2></div></div><p>
In contrast to general-purpose operating systems for the Raspberry Pi, the new
eCosPro from eCosCentric Limited is a lightweight, multithreaded,
industrial-strength RTOS delivering reduced latency with bounded response times.
eCosPro's resource requirements are a fraction of those demanded by a general-purpose OS and maximize the RAM resources available to applications. The RTOS
environment is ideal for time-critical control systems, and by leveraging the
ultra-low-cost Raspberry Pi range of single-board computers, eCosPro provides
cost-effective, full-featured performance ideal for IoT and M2M applications.
Direct boot from an SD card provides an &ldquo;instant-on&rdquo; capability, enabling
embedded applications to be responsive within milliseconds. eCos is portable
across a wide range of embedded architectures and microcontrollers, such that
applications prototyped using eCosPro on Raspberry Pi can be readily ported to
other targets. eCosPro delivers deterministic, real-time performance on the
Raspberry Pi 3, Pi 2, Pi 1, Pi Zero and Pi Zero Wireless boards, as well as the Pi
Compute Modules 1 and 3.
