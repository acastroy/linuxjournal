Use Gophish to evaluate phishing risks in your organization.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae7580.0xbdf250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Phishing is one of the most dangerous threats to modern
computing. Phishing attacks have evolved from sloppily written mass email
blasts to targeted attacks designed to fool even the most cautious 
users. No defense is bulletproof, and most experts agree education and
common sense are the best tools to combat the problem. The question
is how can you safely test your users to determine their response? The
answer in most cases is a phishing campaign&mdash;an ongoing attempt to test
your own users on these types of risks. 
</p><p>
In this article, I examine an
open-source tool called Gophish (<a href="http://www.getgophish.com" target="_self">www.getgophish.com</a>)
that fits the bill for most businesses. I describe how to perform multiple phishing campaigns with Gophish
and create a foundation for ongoing testing. For the example campaigns, I have
selected three popular types of phishing threats: malicious links within
the body of an email that redirect to unwanted sites, links to phony
sites that can capture credentials and, finally, attachment-borne malware.
</p><p>
Before proceedng, I feel the need to insert a few disclaimers. One, do
not perform this work at your business, or any business for that matter,
without the express written approval from that company's management. Two,
make sure to define the scope of your campaign. What types of attacks
will you use? Who do you want to target? What is the time frame for
your campaigns? Answer as many of these questions as thoroughly as you
can. Three, don't diverge from your scope. Limit your testing only to
defined areas. Follow these disclaimers, and if you do encounter any
issues arising from your campaigns, always use caution and consult with
the same management that signed off on them.
</p><p>
Installing Gophish is a snap. You can install it on Linux or Windows. I
chose to use a CentOS 7 distribution for my Gophish server. To install
the program, simply download and extract the install file provided on
the project's site. In my case, I extracted it to the /etc folder. Use
the <tt  >chmod</tt> command to allow the Gophish executable to run.</p><p>
To start the
program, run <tt  >gophish</tt> from a terminal window. This launches a script
that starts the various components of the Gophish program. Once the
script has completed, you are notified that an admin page is running on
http://127.0.0.1:3333 (Figure 1). Open a browser on the local machine and
log in with the default credentials of &ldquo;admin/gophish&rdquo;. Upon logging in,
you are presented with a minimalist interface from which you can start 
working (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Gophish Interface
</p></div></div><p>
Before proceeding to the first campaign, you need to complete some
preliminary work that will be re-used throughout your testing. The first
item is to create a test domain and email address to use with your
campaigns. It's generally a good idea to use a different email/domain
combination for each campaign, but you're going to re-use this information
between the campaigns to conserve space here. 
</p><p>
As it is a known haven of
phishing attacks, I have chosen to use an unused Russian domain for these
purposes. This obviously will not work well if you send or receive a lot
of email from Russia. 
</p><p>
Once you have chosen your domain or domains,
create a DNS zone in your environment and create a host record for
&ldquo;tlbank&rdquo;. This host will come into play during your second
campaign.
</p><p>
I
landed on the e-mail address of somzvanets@fakerussiandomain (use an
actual domain) as the testing address. Make sure to mark your domain as
safe and/or whitelist it on any spam-filtering software or agents you
have deployed in your environment. This also includes anti-virus, as many
products combine protection into one agent.
</p><p>
Let me add one more thing. You have the tools and the ability to get
really creative and successfully deceive your users. However, I believe the goal
is not to dupe users completely, but to give them clues to trigger
the critical thinking centers of their brains. It is specifically those
skills that you want to test and measure, as they are the most valuable
in combatting phishing attacks. Leave breadcrumbs that can assist users
in the threat identification process&mdash;things like misspelled words,
poor grammar, strange phrasing and so on. You have to give your users a hand
through the process. Otherwise, you aren't really testing your users,
you're
simply testing your ability to deceive them. Now, on to the first campaign.
</p><p>
Campaigns in Gophish are made up of several components. The first
is a Sending Profile. This is the phony address from which you will send
mail.
You can have multiple sending profiles on your Gophish server,
but you can use only one at a time per campaign. Click on the Sending
Profile link and fill in the fields displayed (Figure 3). Enter your fake
address in the From field and enter an internal SMTP host. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12162f3.large.jpg"><img src="12162f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Sending Profile
</p></div></div><p>
Note, I strongly recommend using only internal resources available
to you in your testing. Some paid phishing services are web- or cloud-based and may require additional network configuration. I like keeping
everything inside so I absolutely know what is taking place when and on
what hardware. It also will help keep your company's mail servers off
internet blacklists. If your internal SMTP host requires a login,
enter that as well. When your Profile information is complete, use the
Send Test Mail button to confirm that your settings work. When you are
comfortable with your settings, click Save Profile.
</p><p>
The next component to configure is a Landing Page. A landing page is
where the link in your phishing message will send users if they click
the link you provide. Click the Landing Page link on the left. On
the new window, name the page &ldquo;Blank Page&rdquo;. For the first
campaign, 
let's use a simple redirect page. Click the Source button and
enter the following code in the space (enter a site your users commonly
use in the url= section):

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; 
 &#8618;url=http://somewebsite/" /&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Click Save.
</p><p>
Next, you'll create your first Email Template. Templates are the email
messages used in the campaign. Click the Email Templates link on the
left, then click New Template at the top of the page. Give your template
the name of &ldquo;Malicious Link&rdquo; as an identifier for this campaign. On the
New Template screen, you have the option of creating your own template
or importing a custom email. Here you'll use a simple message with
a link to your Blank Page with the redirect code. 
</p><p>
If you choose to use
a custom email tailored after a real-world phishing message, do not
directly use anything from the web. You can scrub those messages with a
fine-tooth comb, but the last thing you want is to miss something that
inadvertently brings malware onto your network. My advice is to transcribe
any examples you want to use. Never copy and paste. Transcribing is the
only sure-fire way to avoid accidentally using any malicious code in
your testing. Thoroughly scan any images you want to download and use. Be
cautious in using images that are not your own. 
</p><p>
It is not necessarily a
bad idea to create a template that resembles a well-known company or, let's
say, financial institution, but be aware there is a chance your users
may actually use services from that company/financial institution. This
becomes a double-edged sword. On the one hand, users actually may have
a connection/account with the company you are impersonating, which could
lead them to click on something they are not sure of. On the other hand,
you want your users to view every message with a critical eye, even the
ones that may affect them.
</p><p>
You can see the text of the message I've created in Figure 4. I have set
the Subject to &ldquo;Delinquent Account&rdquo; as it is both generic and something
that may still catch users' eyes. When creating the link in the
message, use Link Type = URL and set the URL to {{.URL}} (Figure 5). This
sends users who click the link to a unique URL on the Landing Page
you just set up, which the Gophish server uses to track data for the
campaign. Click on Save Template to save and close the template.

Figure 5. Adding the Landing Page URL 
</p></div></div><p>
Click the Users &amp; Groups link. Give the group a descriptive name, and
add users either one at a time using the provided fields or 
bulk import a .csv file. Divide your users into groups as you feel
necessary. You could divide them by geography or site, by job title
or by internal groups. Use whatever strategy best matches your testing
goals. I have simply named mine &ldquo;Test Group&rdquo;.
</p><p>
With all the necessary components in place, click the Campaigns link,
and fill out the fields using the items you created earlier to match
Figure 6. In the URL field, enter the IP address or host name of your Gophish
server. If you don't want the campaign to kick off right away, click
the Schedule button. You can see the test message as delivered
to the test group in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Test Message 
</p></div></div><p>
With the campaign underway, you can view the results on either the Dashboard
or Campaigns link (Figure 8). Leave your campaigns in place for as long as
you feel necessary. A few days normally should suffice, as users have
short memories. When you are ready, you can complete your campaign by
using the Complete button. You should see a Timeline displaying when
the emails were sent and (if successful) when the link was clicked. If
you scroll down, you'll see the results listed by the users in your
group. Any success represents legitimate opportunities for a user to be
lured to a malicious site using a phishing message.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12162f8.large.jpg"><img src="12162f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Viewing the Results
</p></div></div><p>
The next campaign is centered around a phony web site that captures
credentials. Because you're re-using the same Sending Profile for each
campaign, you can move on to the Landing Page. This will be a simple page
with a form input for a user name/password combo. On the new Landing Page
window, enter the &ldquo;Capture Credentials&rdquo;. You are free to use my basic
HTML code below and customize it to your needs, but my suggestion is
to use the Import Site feature to clone a real-world site that would
require a login. I personally have received phishing email messages of this
sort&mdash;claiming to be from a well-known bank with which I have an account,
a data provider I use or popular streaming service to which I subscribe. You
may get better results by mimicking a real site than an obvious fake site
like this one. To use my page, copy the code below in the source view
of the Landing Page window. When you click the submit button, it'll
redirect the user to whatever page you like. I have removed some of the
style tags to keep the code short:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The Totally Legitimate Bank&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$$$$$ The Totally Legitimate Bank 
 &#8618;$$$$$&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
     &lt;em&gt;Your Trusted (wink, wink) Hometown Bank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User ID:&lt;input type="text" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Password:&lt;input type="password" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input onclick="document.location.href 
 &#8618;='http://tlbank.tresk.ru'" type="button" 
 &#8618;value="Click to Login" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Member FDIP&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;trade;2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
You may notice the option to Capture Submitted Data under the code
box. I wouldn't use this option unless management or the decision-makers
explicitly agree to it in your scope. A phishing campaign can be paired
with other kinds of security testing where it may be relevant to capture
this data, but that's not what the goal is here.
</p><p>
For this new Email Template, as you may have guessed, you'll be
impersonating the Totally Legitimate Bank. I have crafted the email shown
in 
Figure 9 to entice users to visit the site. As before, use {{.URL}} for
your
link code in the body. When crafting phishing email that also uses a
complementary site, it's important to match the branding (either real or
fake). Users rarely fall for a site that doesn't match up visually or
otherwise in these scenarios.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12162f9.large.jpg"><img src="12162f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Impersonating the Totally Legitimate Bank
</p></div></div><p>
Click the Campaigns link and open a new campaign. Set the options
to match Figure 10. The URL I've entered is the FQDN of the host (tlbank)
created earlier. If your DNS server has records for the zone and host,
a valid URL will show in the user's browser. This is important, as you
don't want any savvy users familiar with your IP scheme to catch on just
by looking at the URL. Click Launch Campaign when ready. When you
monitor this campaign, you will see the &ldquo;Event: Clicked Link&rdquo;, and if the
user entered data into the fake site, you will see a second red dot with
the &ldquo;Event: Submitted Data&rdquo; indicating a user submitted information in
the form. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12162f10.large.jpg"><img src="12162f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Creating Another New Campaign
</p></div></div><p>
It's possible that users could have left the fields blank and
clicked on the button, and there are two ways to deal with that if you want
to be sure. One, code your form to check and make sure the fields are
filled in before the submit occurs or capture the credentials, which
I don't recommend. When you are satisfied with the results, complete
the campaign. If you have a number of the second &ldquo;Event: Submitted
Data&rdquo;
messages in your results, you should be particularly concerned about your
users'
unknowingly submitting their credentials to an unknown party.
</p><p>
The third and last campaign involves sending users a malicious
attachment. This is a very popular way to install ransomware. The two most
currently used applications that infect users this way are Adobe Acrobat and
Microsoft Word. Unfortunately, Gophish does not currently possess all
of the tools needed to test this, so you'll need to set up additional
resources for this campaign. 
</p><p>
Like the previous &ldquo;Totally Legitimate&rdquo; web
page, you'll use the quick-and-dirty method to get what you need. There
is so much more you can do with this type of test, especially with tools
like Metasploit, but that is beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
Start by downloading a LAMP appliance from
<a href="https://www.turnkeylinux.org/lampstack" target="_self">https://www.turnkeylinux.org/lampstack</a>. I had mine up and running in
less than five minutes. Create a web page called verify.php right off 
the root site using the code below:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php                                                                           
session_start();                                                                $_SESSION['ip'] = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];                                      $counter_name = "/var/www/counter/counter.txt";                                 $iplog_name = "/var/www/counter/ip.txt";                                        

// Check if a text file exists. If not create 
// one and initialize it to zero.   
if (!file_exists($counter_name)) {                                                $f = fopen($counter_name, "w");                                                 fwrite($f,"0");                                                                 fclose($f);                                                                   }                                                                               

// Read the current value of our counter file                                   $f = fopen($counter_name,"r");                                                  $counterVal = fread($f, filesize($counter_name));                               fclose($f);                                                                     

// Has visitor been counted in this session?                                    // If not, increase counter value by one and append ip.txt file                 if(!isset($_SESSION['hasVisited'])){
  $_SESSION['hasVisited']="yes";                                                  $counterVal++;
  $f = fopen($counter_name, "w");
  fwrite($f, $counterVal);
  fclose($f);
  $file = fopen($iplog_name,"a");
  $ip=$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
  echo fwrite($file,$ip);
  echo fwrite($file, "\n");
  fclose ($file);
  header('Location:  http://somewebsite');
}
header('Location:  http://somewebsite');

</pre>
</p><p>
This simple page will count the users as visiting, note their IP address
in a text file and then redirect them to some external site.
</p><p>
Now, let's create the malicious attachment. Assuming you have Microsoft
Word, open the program and a blank document, and press Alt-F11 to open
the VB editor. Create a new module, and use the following code where
http://somewebsite is the name of your LAMP web server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Sub AutoOpen()
myURL = http://mylampserver/verify.php
ShellExecute 0, "OPEN", myURL, "", "", 0
End Sub
</pre>
</p><p>
Save the document as type .docm, and close out of Word.
</p><p>
Back on the Gophish server, create a new Email Template named &ldquo;Malicious
Attachment&rdquo;, and use the document file you created as an attachment by
clicking on the Add Files button. See Figure 11 for the wording of the
template. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12162f11.large.jpg"><img src="12162f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Malicious Attachment Template
</p></div></div><p>
In this example, you are claiming that the user has an unpaid
invoice. You don't need a landing page, so set it as &ldquo;Blank
Page&rdquo; like
in the first campaign. Match the rest of the settings to Figure 12 and Launch
the campaign. You can use a hostname in the URL field, but since you're
not using Gophish to track the campaign, you can just use the the Gophish
server's IP.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12162f12.large.jpg"><img src="12162f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Campaign Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Unlike the previous campaigns, you'll have to track your results using
the text files created with the verify.php page. One note to this
campaign&mdash;most current word processors possess some form of macro
protection, usually a warning prompt. Users will have to bypass those
or enable macros to open the attachment, which means they really wanted
to open it. If you have a lot of hits showing up in the text files on
the LAMP server, you may want to think about increasing the intensity
of scanning inbound attachments, disabling macros if you can, and
as always, educating the affected users of the possible outcomes from
opening suspicious attachments.
</p><p>
With the testing complete, take stock of the successes that you
discovered and address them with either technical or educational
resources. Use these results and push for regular testing if you can
do it. This shouldn't be a one-time test. You should keep your users
sharp, and like with any other skill, you have to exercise regularly to stay
effective. There is an old adage in computer security &ldquo;The bad guys only
have to be right once.&rdquo; Make sure your users are prepared. With turnover,
promotions and responsibility changes, the last thing on many users' minds
is email security. Consistent reinforcement of good security practices
and regular testing to validate your training approach is crucial to
avoiding catastrophe.
