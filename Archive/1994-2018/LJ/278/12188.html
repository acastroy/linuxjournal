Some <span   class="bold"><b>PCI</b></span> devices include their own RAM, and
<span   class="bold"><b>Logan Gunthorpe</b></span> wanted to
make it available to the system as general-purpose memory. He
understood that there could be a slowdown when using RAM from those
devices relative to the RAM chips on the motherboard, but he figured
that in cases of heavy load, it could be worth it. Sometimes what you
really need is every last drop of memory, regardless of any other
consideration.
</p><p>
He posted a patch to implement <span   class="bold"><b>p2pmem</b></span>, a peer-to-peer memory driver
for PCI devices. But to avoid too much slowdown, he constrained his
code to linking memory only from devices that all sat behind the same
PCI switch.
</p><p>
But, <span   class="bold"><b>Sinan Kaya</b></span> didn't like this, saying it wasn't a portable solution.
He wanted Logan to remove any such restrictions and let users
decide for themselves if the performance hit was too terrible or if
the code wouldn't work at all with a given device. That way, Logan's
patch would work the same on all architectures.
</p><p>
They went back and forth about this. Logan felt it was important to
ensure good performance, which required the code to include a certain
amount of understanding of the hardware it controlled. The simplest
approach was to support PCI devices that were all behind the same
switch; anything more generic than that, he said, risked exploding the
complexity of the code, as well as the need to list tons of specific
devices and their compatibility issues.
</p><p>
But ultimately, Sinan made the point that Logan's code simply could be
generic and allow users to shoot themselves in the foot if they so
desired. Logan's patch would be off by default anyway, so there was no
harm in letting users make the final call based on their own
knowledge of the hardware on their systems.
</p><p>
This actually had been Logan's inclination from the start, but he'd
received push-back from the <span   class="bold"><b>LSF</b></span> (load sharing facility) folks, who
preferred things to be simple and functional. But with Sinan's
argument about portability, Logan said it made more sense to remove
the requirement that all shared memory devices be behind the same PCI
switch and just let users make the decision themselves.
</p><p>
The discussion ended there, but presumably, the LSF folks will have
their own objections, and the whole patch will have to go through
several more iterations before everyone is fully satisfied, especially
the kernel maintainers themselves.
</p><p>
Sometimes it's useful to have a whole separate thread running a
particular kernel operation. If something is complicated and can take
an arbitrary amount of time, giving it its own thread can fix latency
issues by adding it to the normal process rotation in the scheduler.
Then it can take however long it wants, without inconveniencing other
parts of the kernel.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>printk()</b></span> function is a good example of something that would
benefit from having its own <span   class="bold"><b>kthread</b></span>. The printk() function sends
messages to the console, to keep users informed of any problems
with the system. Unfortunately, printk() works only in certain
contexts and can take an arbitrary amount of time to execute. For
people writing code in any given part of the kernel, it can be
annoying to keep track of where and how to call printk() such that it
will work. Putting printk() in its own kernel thread would greatly
simplify that whole question.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sergey Senozhatsky</b></span> recently posted some code to do
this, but although it
did receive some initial interest, folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Peter
Zijlstra</b></span> objected.
</p><p>
The problem with putting something into its own kernel thread is that
each thread is a permanent drain on overall performance. The scheduler
must cycle through every single thread, many times per second. As the
number of threads on a system goes up, the system performance can
become choppier and choppier. As a result, any new feature that
requires a new kernel thread typically must have something really
stupendous to offer. Maybe it resolves a security issue or makes
people's lives much easier than they were before, or maybe it's
something that just naturally belongs in a separate thread.
</p><p>
The printk() function may turn out to have a valid need for its own
thread. But since printk() works fairly well as currently implemented,
there are bound to be plenty of other folks like Peter who need to be
convinced.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>AVR32 Architecture</b></span> is being removed from the kernel. It's an old
system-on-a-chip that came out of <span   class="bold"><b>Atmel</b></span>
corporation. But Atmel hasn't
supported it in quite some time, and it has become a drag on other
architectures that share drivers with it, such as the <span   class="bold"><b>Atmel
ARM SoC</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Hans-Christian Noren Egtvedt</b></span> posted a patch to get rid of it, and a
bunch of people cheered out loud. Various folks also suggested
additional parts of the kernel source that could be included in the
AVR32 wipeout.
</p><p>
In some ways, it's sad to lose an architecture like this. Sometimes
it's fun to think about running a modern version of Linux on an old
<span   class="bold"><b>TRS-80</b></span> color computer or whatnot. But, the kernel is a living project.
And it's somewhat uplifting to remember that, aside from its
mysterious absence from desktop systems, Linux does indeed essentially
run the entire internet&mdash;everything connected to it and everything
not connected to it. So I guess we can do without the AVR32
architecture.
</p><p>
Some things we don't like and we can fix. Other things we don't like,
but the fix is worse. Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Hellwig</b></span> railed against the
fact that system calls would accept any input flag at all and just
ignore the ones that weren't supported. The reason the kernel does
this is so that user code can run on older kernels without making the
system calls choke on unknown input.
</p><p>
The bad part, unfortunately, is that it makes it impossible for user
code to probe a system call to see whether a given feature is supported.
And it turns out that some user code really would benefit from
being able to do things like that&mdash;for example, atomic input/output.
</p><p>
One problem with fixing the system calls to reject unsupported input
flags is that it would break existing binaries running in the world.
All such binaries would need to be recompiled, which would be a
problem if the binaries are very old and the source code is no longer
available, which is actually a significant possibility in some cases.
</p><p>
Breaking existing binaries is called an <span   class="bold"><b>ABI</b></span> (application binary
interface) change, and it's allowed only under very extreme
circumstances&mdash;for example, if it's the only way to plug a given
security hole.
</p><p>
But, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> didn't like Christoph's idea for another reason
entirely. He said, &ldquo;probing for flags is why we *could* add things
like O_NOATIME etc - exactly because it 'just worked' with old
kernels, and people could just use the new flags knowing that it was a
no-op on old kernels.&rdquo;
</p><p>
So even though some users would benefit from being able to probe for
features, even more users benefit from not having to worry about a
given feature failing to do anything at all.
