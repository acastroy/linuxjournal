I love classic Volkswagen Beetles. In fact, I own more than one. (It only
makes sense to have one convertible and one sedan!) One of the best things
about owning classic Volkswagens is that fixing and maintaining them
is really simple. Kyle Rankin would agree with me on that, because he's
also a Volkswagen fan, although his VW of choice is a Ghia. Nevertheless,
when it comes to maintenance, those old rear-engine vehicles are simple
and fun. Linux is a bit like that. It's not the sort of OS everyone uses;
there are many friendly people online willing to help you fix things,
and everyone who sees you use it will be jealous!

This month, Reuven M. Lerner starts things off by talking about Data
Science. Technology and computers have become such an integral part of
our lives, that data itself has become invaluable. Reuven explains what
Data Science is all about, how it affects our world and provides many
resources to help you learn more about it. 
</p><p>
Dave Taylor
follows up with a nifty article on extracting information about song
lyrics using scripts. In true Dave Taylor fashion, he teaches how to
pull data from an online source and analyze the data while having fun
along the way. Even if you're not interested in statistical information
about 1960s artists' lyrics, you'll want to read his column this issue
for the scripting tricks.

Kyle Rankin talks about the Jira ticketing system again this month,
but rather than learning about the system itself, Kyle describes how
to interact with the system via the command line. A GUI is nice, but
if you're trying to update tickets while you're knee deep in terminal
windows, it's nice to make a change without opening a web browser. 
</p><p>
I go
the opposite way in my column this month and explain how I stream my bird feeder
cam to YouTube in order to provide a live stream that doesn't stress
my bandwidth. I've talked about most of the tools separately, but in this
article, I explain how to
automate the live stream.
</p><p>
We pick up where we left off last month with Nathan R. Vance, Michael
L. Poublon and William F. Polik teaching how to create your own computer
cluster. Their last article covered setting up the hardware, 
and this month, they describe how to automate the installation process for
individual nodes. Making the
process fully automated requires a bit of work up front, but the authors
walk through the process here step by step.

Last but not least, Jeremiah Bowling has a fascinating article on
phishing your own users. No, he doesn't teach you how to steal your users'
credit-card numbers, but rather he explains how to use the open-source
Gophish package to test your users. Obviously, the process
must be coupled with education in order for it to work, but coming up
with phishing scenarios that are both safe and effective for testing
is hard! I didn't know such a thing existed, but sure enough, it does,
and Jeremiah explains how to use it.

We also have new product announcements, tech tips, cool apps and all
the usual things you've come to expect in every issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. So
whether you're a fan of maintaining your Linux machines or just want
to try the latest and greatest toys, we've got you covered. This is a fun
issue, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we enjoyed putting it together!
