    How the GPL has been sorely defamed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29a4580.0x2a9c500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Defamation is the &ldquo;communication to
third parties of false statements about a person that injure the
reputation of, or deter others from associating with, that
person.&rdquo;
</p><p>Unfortunately, under the law, you can't be sued for defaming
a software license. If I could, I'd sue Microsoft for what it has
said about the GPL. Their statements are false and are obviously
intended to deter companies from associating with GPL-licensed
software&mdash;specifically Linux.</p><p>The latest onslaught from Redmond came in the &ldquo;Royalty-Free
CIFS Technical Reference License Agreement&rdquo;, under which Microsoft
offers to license its CIFS technical specifications, along with
certain of its patents necessary to implement those specifications,
on a royalty-free basis. (Read it yourself at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnkerb/html/Finalcifs_LicenseAgrmnt_032802.asp" target="_self">msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnkerb/html/Finalcifs_LicenseAgrmnt_032802.asp</a>.)</p><p>At first I was thrilled to see that Microsoft was willing to
license its patents on a royalty-free basis. Members of the Open
Source community have long insisted on royalty-free patent licenses
for any technology needed for interworking or other standard
implementations. But there are so many exclusions and limitations
to the CIFS license that this license is useless for anything
except Microsoft's propaganda purposes; I can't imagine anyone who
will want the CIFS technical specifications under those
terms.</p><p>For example, the license is limited to implementations on
&ldquo;Non-Microsoft Platforms&rdquo;. Whoopee! That's how Microsoft stops
direct competition at the doorstep so that nobody can write better
software to replace any of Microsoft's own software.</p><p>It was the insult in the CIFS license that really caught my
eye. The CIFS technical specifications and patents are not
available for use with software that is distributed under an &ldquo;IPR
Impairing License&rdquo;. This term is defined as:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>...the GNU General Public License, the GNU
Lesser/Library General Public License, and any license that
requires in any instance that other software distributed with
software subject to such license (a) be disclosed and distributed
in source code form; (b) be licensed for purposes of making
derivative works; or (c) be redistributable at no charge.</p></blockquote></div><p>So Microsoft again reveals that the only real competition it
fears is from Linux and other open-source software.
</p><p>The term IPR Impairing stands for intellectual property
rights impairing. In Microsoft's confused lexicon, the GPL impairs
intellectual property rights. Whose? How? Is the impairment good or
bad?</p><p>There is nothing in the GPL that impairs anyone's
intellectual property rights, and it is outrageous for Microsoft to
assert otherwise. Anyone can use GPL-licensed software without any
effect at all on his or her own intellectual property. For example,
you don't have to publish your source code merely by running your
software under Linux. You can even modify GPL-licensed
code&mdash;including Linux&mdash;and as long as you don't distribute your
modifications you incur no obligation whatsoever to distribute the
source code to your modifications. (By way of contrast, don't you
dare to reverse-engineer, much less modify, Microsoft code!)</p><p>You are not forced to license your software under the GPL and
to distribute your source code&mdash;except in one rare situation: if
you take GPL-licensed software, modify it and distribute your
modified version, you must license your modified software under the
GPL.</p><p>This reciprocity provision is based upon a legitimate
bargain. In essence, the licensor is giving you broad rights to his
or her software, including the right to create and distribute
modifications, but only if you agree to reciprocate by returning
your distributed modifications to the commons. You must pay for the
right to create and distribute modified software, but the currency
for your payment is not money&mdash;it is your improved software
itself.</p><p>How does that differ in principle from the obligation to pay
the asking price for Microsoft software?</p><p>The owner of GPL-licensed intellectual property is
establishing a price for a license to his or her property. You are
always free to decide not to make and distribute modifications to
GPL-licensed software, but if you elect to do so, you must pay the
price set by the owner of the original software. You received a
benefit from the free software you modified to create your own
software, and the price for that benefit is reciprocity.</p><p>That is simply capitalism at its finest. The GPL is not,
despite Bill Gates' protestations to the contrary, the end of
capitalism as we know it.</p><p>What can be far more serious challenges to capitalism are the
monopolistic practices that Microsoft continues to engage in. That
company pretends it is offering a royalty-free license to CIFS, but
the license doesn't apply to implementations on either the
Microsoft platform or on the major challenger to that platform,
Linux.</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft's white elephant sale. I suggest you
don't buy.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
