beer bottle among the pages of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
for a chance at some auto accoutrements is a worthy way to spend
what little free time you have. Jon maddog Hall even sent in a
correct answer (albeit too late to qualify for the prize), telling
us &ldquo;You can't hide beer from maddog&rdquo;, as if we didn't
know.</p><p>Many hundreds of readers were sharp enough to find the beer
bottle on the table on page 93 in the &ldquo;Crystal Space&rdquo; article.
Some even picked up on the hint by way of the 3-D glasses
suggestion. Others should spend more time looking for beer (or
better yet&mdash;a job) and less time drinking it, for they &ldquo;found&rdquo;
beer in the most remarkable places in the magazine's pages. For
these folks we're offering another chance. To make the new start
fresh, this time you'll be looking for something completely
different&mdash;a mug of beer&mdash;and no, it's not the one pictured here.
This one is an <span   class="emphasis"><em>example</em></span>. For this month's prize
we'll be letting you help us clean out our warehouse by accepting
some pristine vintage <i  >Linux Journal</i> XL
T-shirts. This time, correct responders numbered 200-300 will
win.</p><p>Send your mailing address with your answer to

Convenience</h2></div></div><p>I have a very real need for programs to treat other programs
as data because I do a lot of work in program-writing programs, or
&ldquo;metaprogramming&rdquo;, for CAD applications. I've done this sort of
programming in Python and in C++, but I'm increasingly finding the
Lisp family of languages to be the power tool I have always wanted.
Recently, I was very pleasantly surprised with the power and
features of MIT Scheme Release 7.7.0, released in March
2002.</p><p>Scheme is now more than 20 years old but is very robust,
containing numerous concepts only now being seen in late-modern
languages, such as C++ and Java. For instance, Scheme has
continuations, where the state of a computation becomes in essence
a controllable object. This powerful and general facility is useful
for concurrency, modeling, multithreading and arbitrary control
flows.</p><p>MIT Scheme's library, SLIB, contains support for working with
getopt, HTML, relational databases and other functionality similar
to the Python or Perl libraries. There is a very powerful Scheme
Object System OOP library, which has features similar to the Common
Lisp Object System (CLOS).</p><p>Scheme seems to have a close kinship with Common Lisp.
However, MIT Scheme is not only GPLed, but feels more approachable,
with a simpler syntax than Common Lisp. For my work, Scheme's
scoping model and use of namespace are somewhat better than Common
Lisp programs.</p><p>To get started with MIT Scheme, see the project home page:

Heat</h2></div></div><p>It was law professor and author Lawrence Lessig who first
described the battle for control of the Net as a kind of civil war
between Northern and Southern California: between Silicon Valley
and Hollywood.</p><p>The North, he says, &ldquo;believes in a free exchange of ideas&rdquo;.
The modern South wants to protect intellectual property the way the
old South wanted to protect its privileged plantation system. If
you want to traffic in any of its copyrighted material, you have to
visit &ldquo;their plantation and seek permission from the master&rdquo;.
And, &ldquo;if you develop technology that interferes with their right
of perfect control, you will be punished.&rdquo;</p><p>In this civil war, everyone who wants to protect the Net's
wide-open frontiers is a Siliconian, and everyone who wants to
maintain absolute control over the distribution and use of
&ldquo;content&rdquo; is a Hollywoodian.</p><p>The latter would include Jamie Kellner, the chairman and CEO
of Turner Broadcasting, who was installed by AOL's Bob Pittman in
the wake of the AOL/Time Warner merger. In an April 2002 interview
with Cableworld, Kellner said, &ldquo;I'm a big believer we have to make
television more convenient or we will drive the penetration of PVRs
and things like that, which I'm not sure is good for the cable
industry or the broadcast industry or the networks.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked to explain why, he continued:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Because of the ad skips....It's theft. Your
contract with the network when you get the show is you're going to
watch the spots. Otherwise you couldn't get the show on an
ad-supported basis. Any time you skip a commercial or watch the
button you're actually stealing the programming.</p></blockquote></div><p>PVRs are Personal Video Recorders. The most popular PVR is
the Linux-powered TiVo. Its main competition comes from ReplayTV,
which sells under the Panasonic and SonicBlue brand names. ReplayTV
PVRs have the power not only to record TV programs, but to share
them over the Net. To Hollywood, sharing is theft. In testimony
before Congress, Jack Valenti, chairman and CEO of the Motion
Picture Association of America (MPAA), said, &ldquo;The potential
undoing of America's greatest export trade prize...is the theft of
movies in both the analog and digital formats.&rdquo; In that same
testimony, he outlined a three-prong attack on &ldquo;piracy&rdquo; that
began this way:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>First, we have taken on the task of protecting
copyright laws in the courts....We have to insist that copyright
laws cannot be casually regarded, for if those laws are shrunk or
loosened, the entire fabric of costly creative works is in deep
trouble.</p></blockquote></div>

So, as I write this (on May 2, 2002), ReplayTV finds itself the
subject of a lawsuit brought by a raft of TV and film studios. In
the course of discovery, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking
ReplayTV to turn over precise customer usage records. Cory
Doctorow, outreach director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
describes what happened next:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As we understand it, the Court ordered ReplayTV
to change its software to include spyware that will capture its
customers' clickstream&mdash;every commercial skipped, every show
watched, every recording shared over the network. The plaintiffs&mdash;a
cabal of Hollywood studios and TV networks&mdash;asked for this
information as part of the pretrial discovery process, and when
ReplayTV responded that it did not have the data or the means to
collect it, the judge ordered them to change the software to
collect the information within 60 days. When ReplayTV tried to
safeguard its customers privacy by making the mandated spyware an
opt-in process, the judge denied the request.</p></blockquote></div>

By the way, TiVo does not collect individual data&mdash;only aggregate
statistics&mdash;and all data gathering is opt-out for customers. But
the precedent here puts TiVo no less at risk than ReplayTV.
Valenti's legal attack strategy is sure to send a message to the
legal departments of the world's TiVos.
</p><p>In a recent interview with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Business 2.0</em></span>,
Lessig explained the strategic context:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The problem today is that the words
&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; have become captured by people like my
friend Jack Valenti, who goes around talking about intellectual
property not as a balance but as an extreme; not as something that
we're supposed to be constantly restriking as technologies change
to make sure it doesn't stifle innovation, but as a tool that the
dinosaurs can use to make sure there are no mammals in the
future.</p></blockquote></div><p>Cory Doctorow puts it another way, &ldquo;The role of the
technology industry is to blaze new trails that create new
opportunities for Hollywood. The role of Hollywood is to seek
injunctive relief from those opportunities.&rdquo;
</p><p>But Silicon Valley has some friends whose jobs cross the
boundaries. Mark Cuban, most familiar these days as the
high-profile owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA basketball team, is
also chairman of HDNet, the first all-HD (high definition) TV
network. At a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters,
Cuban called on the broadcasting industry to &ldquo;just completely
ignore&rdquo; Hollywood in the fight over copyright and intellectual
property, calling the litigious studios a &ldquo;chicken little
environment&rdquo;.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2010580.0x2503718"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>I would point out that linked lists, mark-and-copy garbage
collection, and the Tab key are all patented too. Somebody who
always carefully checked first for software patents would never
write anything at all.</p><p>&mdash;Martin Pool, in the rsync FAQ</p><p>VANTEC does offer a limited warranty but as a practical
matter that warranty is seldom applicable to competitive and
particularly destructive robot contests.</p><p>&mdash;Vantec.com web site</p><p>The public interest in public-domain intellectual property
freezes dead with the humble birth of a cartoon mouse on a tabletop
in Kansas City. The Mouse is flash-frozen in legal ice. He's
unrotting. He's undying. He's cryogenically preserved....In ancient
Rome, folks thought it was pretty decadent when the Emperor
Caligula made his horse a Senator. But in the modern US Senate,
there's a Senator who's a cartoon mouse!</p><p>&mdash;Bruce Sterling</p><p>Don't be fooled. The BPDG standard is not about stopping
&ldquo;piracy&rdquo;. It's about Hollywood regaining some measure of control
over what you can and can't do with television. It's about cramming
the VCR genie back in the bottle and giving Hollywood the power to
bring new technologies to heel before they can deliver new
capabilities to consumers.</p><p>&mdash;Fred von Lohmann</p><p>If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of
servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from
us in peace. We ask not your counsel nor your arms. Crouch down and
lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains rest lightly upon you
and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen.</p><p>&mdash;Samuel Adams</p><p>We're moving towards a &ldquo;Creole&rdquo; of technological concepts.
The idea comes from language theory, specifically Steven Pinker's
work where adults come together in an area with lots of different
languages and end up coming up with a broken, lumpy language that
is put together as a pidgin language. When the next generation
comes along, however, it becomes more sophisticated and develops
into a real language, then called a Creole. You only have to watch
kids today using technology to realize the similarities, and that
we adults are very much the pidgins.</p><p>&mdash;Douglas Adams</p></div></div>
