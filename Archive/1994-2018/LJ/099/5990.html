    Ericsson Research is developing a new secure architecture
    for telecom applications on Linux clusters.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ad580.0x25a53f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The interest in clustering from the
telecommunications industry originates with the fact that clusters
address carrier-class characteristics, such as guaranteed service
availability, reliability and scaled performance, using
cost-effective hardware and software. These carrier-class
requirements now include advanced levels of security. There are few
efforts, however, to build a coherent distributed framework to
provide advanced security levels in clustered systems.
</p><p>At Ericsson Research, our work targets soft real-time
distributed applications running on large-scale Linux carrier-class
clusters. These clusters must operate nonstop and must allow
operators to upgrade hardware and software during operation,
without disturbing the applications that run on them. In such
clusters, communications between the nodes inside the cluster and
to external computers are restricted.</p><p>In this article, we present the rationale behind developing a
new secure architecture, the DSI (Distributed Security
Infrastructure). DSI supports different security mechanisms to
address the needs of telecom applications running on carrier-class
Linux clusters. DSI provides these telecom applications with
distributed mechanisms for access control, authentication, auditing
and integrity of communications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ad580.0x25a55b0"></a>The Need for a New Security Approach</h2></div></div><p>Many security solutions exist for clustered servers, but no
solution is dedicated to clusters.</p><p>The most commonly used security approach is to package
several existing solutions. Nevertheless, the integration and
management of these different packages is complex and often results
in the absence of interoperability between different security
mechanisms. Additional difficulties also are raised when
integrating many packages, issues like ease of system maintenance
and upgrade, and difficulty keeping up with numerous security
patches.</p><p>Carrier-class clusters have very tight restrictions on
performance and response time, making the design of security
solutions difficult. In fact, many security solutions cannot be
used due to their high-resource consumption.</p><p>Currently implemented security mechanisms are based on user
privileges and do not support authentication and authorization
checks for interactions between two processes belonging to the same
system on different processors. However, for telecom applications,
only a few users run the same application for a long period without
any interruption.</p><p>Applying the above concept will grant the same security
privileges to all processes created on different nodes. This would
lead to no security checks for many actions through the distributed
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ad580.0x25a5818"></a>DSI Characteristics</h2></div></div><p>As part of a carrier-class Linux cluster, DSI must comply
with the carrier-class requirements of reliability, scalability and
high availability. Furthermore, DSI supports the following
requirements: 1) Coherent framework: security must be coherent
across different layers of heterogeneous hardware, applications,
middleware, operating systems and networking technologies. All
mechanisms must fit together to prevent any exploitable security
gap in the system. 2) Process-level approach: DSI is based on a
fine-grained basic entity, the process. 3) Minimal performance
impact: the introduction of security features must not impose
high-performance penalties. Performance can be expected to degrade
slightly during the initial establishment of a security context;
however, the impact on subsequent accesses must be negligible. 4)
Preemptive security: changes in the security context will be
reflected immediately on the running security services. Whenever
the security context of a subject changes, the system will
re-evaluate its current use of resources against this new security
context. 5) Dynamic security policy: it must be possible to support
runtime changes in the distributed security policy. Carrier-class
server nodes must provide continuous and long-term availability;
thus, it is impossible to interrupt the service to enforce a new
security policy. 6) Transparent key management: cryptographic keys
are generated in order to secure connections. This results in
numerous keys that must be stored and managed securely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ad580.0x25a5920"></a>DSI Architecture</h2></div></div><p>DSI has two types of components: management and service. DSI
management components define a thin layer that includes a security
server, security managers and a security communication channel
(Figure 1). The service components define a flexible layer that can
be modified or updated by adding, replacing or removing services
according to the needs.</p><p>The security server is the central point of management in
DSI, the entry point for secure operation and management and
intrusion detection systems. It also defines the dynamic security
environment of the whole cluster by broadcasting changes in the
distributed policy to all security managers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5990f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Distributed Architecture of DSI
</p></div></div><p>Security managers enforce security at each node of the
cluster. They are responsible for locally enforcing changes in the
security environment. Security managers only exchange security
information with the security server.</p><p>The secure communication channel provides encrypted and
authenticated communications between security agents. All
communications between the security server and the world outside of
the cluster take place through the secure communication channel.
Two nodes (to avoid a single point of failure) host the security
server and different security service providers, such as the
certification authority.</p><p>The security mechanisms are based on widely known, proved and
tested algorithms. Users must not be able to bypass these
mechanisms; therefore, the best place to enforce security is at the
kernel level. All security decisions, when necessary, are
implemented at the kernel level, the same as for the main security
manager component, which has stubs into the kernel. These stubs are
implemented through load modules.</p><p>The DSI architecture at each node is based on a set of
loosely coupled services. Each service, upon its creation, sends a
presence announcement to the local security manager, which
registers these services and provides their access mechanisms to
the internal modules. Two types of services, security services
(access control, authentication, integration, auditing) and
security service providers (for example, secure key management),
run at user level and provide services to security managers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ad580.0x25a5d98"></a>Current Results</h2></div></div><p>So far, a secure boot mechanism for diskless Linux servers
has been implemented. Using secure boot with digital signatures, a
distributed trusted computing base (DTCB) will be available at the
boot of the cluster nodes. The kernel at secure boot is small
enough to be thoroughly tested for vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
the use of digital signatures for binaries and a local
certification authority will prevent malicious modifications to the
DTCB.</p><p>We also implemented a security module based on the Linux
Security Module (LSM), which enforces the security policy as part
of the DSI access control service. This module is integrated with
SCC to implement distributed access control mechanisms. DSI
currently supports preemptive and dynamic security policy at the
process level throughout the whole cluster.</p><p>To ease administration and maintenance of the distributed
security policy, we are completing a study to devise methods of
reusing information already contained in package management systems
(such as RPM) in order to generate part of the security policy or
to push such information to the package (if that is where it would
be best specified). This effort also aims to use the policy to
provide clearly different privileges during software installation,
configuration, activation and execution. Specification of the exact
language used to express the policy and of the compilation and
loading mechanisms remain to be completed.</p><p>We have partly implemented a secure communication channel
based on OmniORB, an open-source implementation of CORBA. SCC
logics are implemented on top of a portability layer, making the
implementation independent of any communication middleware used.
The choice of CORBA as communication middleware for SCC was
motivated by many factors, such as the support for distributed
real-time and embedded systems and interoperability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ad580.0x25a5fa8"></a>DSI as an Open-Source Project</h2></div></div><p>Our goal for DSI is to make the framework open source and to
get people from different organizations and open-source initiatives
involved in the design and development of the various
components.</p><p>Figure 2 presents the various components of DSI. All
components with a question mark are open to design and development
contribution. Currently at Ericsson Research we are working toward
implementing the core DSI, which includes the following: secure
communication channel, security server, security manager, access
control service (including LSM), security policy generation,
security session manager and distributed tracing of events (as part
of the auditing service).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5990f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Ottawa Linux Symposium for three allocated presentations on DSI. We
will also be available at the IEEE Cluster Conference 2002 in
Chicago. In addition, Ericsson Research will be hosting the annual
Open Cluster Group meetings June 24-25, in Montr&eacute;al, which
will give us the opportunity to address the members of the group
and get them involved with the DSI Project.</p><p>A web site for the project is available as of June 2002. It
provides DSI technical reports, presentations, source code and
links to web sites of other contributors. Due to space limitations,
we were not able to go into the details of DSI in this article.
However, feel free to contact any of the DSI team members (listed
below) to receive detailed papers on the DSI architecture, strategy
and source code or to discuss collaboration opportunities.
