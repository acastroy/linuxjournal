If it doesn't, chances are Sytek, Corvus, Bridge and Excelan are
just as mysterious. Yet there was a time, back in the early- to
mid-eighties, when these were big names in networking. If you read
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Data Communications</em></span> back then, or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Communications Week</em></span>, you would have seen a lot
of stories about (and advertising by) those companies, alongside
more durable names like 3Com, IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and
Wang.
</p><p>In those days the arguments were mostly about &ldquo;pipes and
protocols&rdquo;. IBM pushed Token Ring (IEEE 802.5), which ran on
special IBM wiring. DEC had a breed of Ethernet (802.3) that ran on
its own coaxial cable. Corvus had Omninet, an Ethernet variant that
ran on twisted pair. Wang had Wangnet, which ran on...something, I
forget what. Same with AT&amp;T's ISN (Information Systems
Network). Everybody had their own arcane implementation of one
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; datalink protocol or another. Each required their own
special topology, of course, as well as their own transmission
methods. You couldn't get away from articles comparing broadband
against baseband and star vs. bus vs. ring topologies.</p><p>Around 1987 or so I did a bunch of work for Ungermann-Bass,
which specialized in big networking jobs for big companies. U-B was
naturally attracted to MAP, the Manufacturing Automation Protocol
developed by General Motors in 1982 to standardize networking
within the company's many factories and manufacturing facilities.
MAP came to be known as MAP/TOP after it was mooshed together with
Boeing's Technical Office Protocol. MAP/TOP was conceived around
IEEE 802.4, which required a bus topology, although it distributed
data with a token in the manner of IBM's Token Ring networks. This
was supposed to be a more robust and noise-immune approach than the
more popular Ethernet alternatives.</p><p>U-B's efforts were well meaning and highly regarded by the
press but were undermined by Ethernet's success, even on factory
floors. Not only was Ethernet relatively cheap, but it integrated
nicely with networked PCs, which by default used Ethernet as
well&mdash;thanks to the successful efforts of companies like 3Com,
which made Ethernet interface cards by the millions.</p><p>All due credit to U-B, there was no way to know MAP wouldn't
catch on, or even that the combined industrial heft of General
Motors and Boeing couldn't lever the market to 802.4. Even though
they cost hundreds of dollars apiece, 3Com's Ethernet cards were
cheap and ubiquitous. As for higher-level transport and
internetworking protocols, there was even less reason to believe
that TCP/IP would ultimately define the most universal network ever
created: the Internet.</p><p>What's amazing to me now, looking back over the years, is how
long it takes to establish a given protocol, and how so many huge
companies bet and lost their ranches on protocols that markets
never ratified.</p><p>Today we're accustomed to thinking of &ldquo;internet time&rdquo; as
something that moves very fast. We credit Moore's Law with
improving new computers while obsoleting old ones in less time than
it takes to grow a crop of asparagus. Yet protocols mature in about
the time it takes an apple seed to become a fruit-bearing tree.
Craig Burton, CEO of JanusLogix, says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The time it takes to invent, create, develop and
standardize on a protocol for any given service is way out of
alignment with what is happening in the marketplace. Take LDAP.
LDAP v3 was introduced some six years ago at this point. You think
the Linux kernel takes a long time to move, it is lightning fast
compared to how fast a protocol moves.</p></blockquote></div><p>I just checked and it's now closer to seven years. The same
thing seems to be happening, by the way, with IPv6. Any bets on how
long it's going to take before it becomes a de facto standard?
</p><p>So the protocol problem is a big reason why the Internet is
so successful yet so limited.</p><p>Look at the core protocols that enable the Net's basic
services: HTTP, FTP, LDAP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP and SNMP, to name
seven. In effect, these are the Net's true infrastructure because
they govern the few services the Net can universally support. The
Net grew around this set of protocols precisely because they were
simple, unencumbered by corporate ownership and easily ubiquitized.
The X.400 standard defined a rich set of e-mail functionalities,
but it was a pain in the butt to implement. SMTP and POP3 were free
and easy, so those protocols came to serve as the universal
infrastructure for e-mail service.</p><p>Yet even today no internet protocols support the rich and
complex file, print and directory services that come standard with,
say, Novell's NetWare.</p><p>Many internet services remain undeployed (or underdeployed)
for lack of enabling protocols. Instant messaging (IM) is one
example. The fact that any of us can download an IM client from AOL
or Microsoft doesn't mean that the Net itself possesses any kind of
IM standard. AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo! and Lotus all have IM systems
that use arcane, proprietary and closed protocols, each restricting
their own clients to their own servers. Thus, AOL's AIM clients are
like browsers that can only visit one web site. Without the IM
equivalent of an HTTP or an SMTP, there is no IM equivalent of
Apache or Sendmail. The only serious candidate at this point is
Jabber's protocol
(<a href="http://www.jabber.org" target="_self">www.jabber.org</a>), but
it's still new&mdash;more shrub than seed, but far from a fruit-bearing
tree. Meanwhile, the Net has no IM infrastructure.</p><p>Security is another one. Computing has been around for 50
years or more, and we still think about security largely in terms
of firewalls. (I got an e-mail this morning from a guy who can't
see one of our web pages here at <i  >Linux Journal</i>
because his Fortune 500 company's firewall excludes pages that
contain the word &ldquo;suck&rdquo;.)</p><p>Firewalls are a medieval solution to a 21st-century problem.
Their models are forts and castles, moats and drawbridges. The
result is what Craig Burton calls</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Web noir&mdash;a technological Dark Age obscured by
the apparent brilliance of the Internet, as we know it. The
dark&mdash;that noir&mdash;is what we don't see, what we don't know because
it doesn't yet exist.</p></blockquote></div><p>(See
<a href="http://www.craigburton.com/stories/storyReader$19" target="_self">www.craigburton.com/stories/storyReader$19</a>.)
</p><p>The first bright hope for a renaissance, Burton says, is XML
(eXtensible Markup Language). With the recent development of SOAP,
WSDL, WSIL, UDDI and WSIL, XML makes web services possible. Some of
these services look so promising that Microsoft, IBM and Sun are
pushing their own web service frameworks: .NET, J2EE and SunOne, to
name three.</p><p>Yet for all their inclusivities (especially in promotional
rhetoric) frameworks have an exclusive effect. They lock in
customers and lock out competitors. If the Net has proven anything,
it is that exclusive architectures, frameworks and environments all
fail as universal infrastructure. Yet they have their appeal, even
to people who ought to know better. Take Mark Forman, the White
House technology czar. In April 2002, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seattle
Times</em></span> reported that Forman was operating on the
erroneous assumption that Microsoft's Passport technology might
serve as a kind of national identity infrastructure.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seattle Times</em></span> wrote,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Forget about a national ID card. Instead, the
federal government might use Microsoft's Passport technology to
verify the on-line identity of America's citizens, federal
employees and businesses, according to the White House technology
czar.
</p><p>On Sept. 30, the government plans to begin testing web sites
where businesses can pay taxes and citizens can learn about
benefits and social services. It's also exploring how to verify the
identity of users so the sites can share private
information.</p></blockquote></div><p>(See
<a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134438173_passport18.html" target="_self">seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134438173_passport18.html</a>.)
</p><p>Passport will fail that mission for the same reason AOL's and
Microsoft's instant-messaging systems will ultimately fail as
universal standards, no matter how popular they are today: they are
owned by people with vested interests in keeping their properties
closed and exclusive.</p><p>Identity should be another of those fundamental web services.
Your self, your car and a drill press on a factory floor should all
have unique identities that make sense in the universal context of
the Net&mdash;someday. But how will that happen? Will it depend on yet
another protocol or some new set of protocols? By what
decade?</p><p>So let's raise a question: if we can't speed the evolution of
protocols, can we at least find a way to reduce or eliminate their
role as a gating factor for progress? Can we eliminate this drag on
Moore's Law, as well as our own sense of possibilities?</p><p>When we find the answer, Burton says, &ldquo;the result will be as
transformative as the discovery of calculus, which accelerated
scientific revolutions and helped bring on the
Renaissance.&rdquo;</p></div></div>
