What would you say the strongest improvements to Icarus were in the
last year?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> Oh, my&mdash;there were
so many. I think the most significant improvement has been the
simulation engine. By removing the C++ compiler from the Verilog
compilation process, I've improved compiler performance several
orders of magnitude. I've also made the compiler far more portable.
The past year has also seen new compatibility with de facto
standards such as library formats and command files. This makes the
compiler accessible to more people.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> Icarus seems a lot
stronger now. In particular, for simulation use Icarus seems to be
starting to challenge commercial tools. Could you comment on how
you see the quality of results for Icarus so far?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> I never expected to
be able to honestly challenge commercial tools, but here I am all
the same. Commercial quality is the benchmark I use for judging my
progress on Icarus Verilog, and I've made progress in that
direction. Most of the feedback I've received in the past has been
from people already using commercial tools who notice that Icarus
Verilog does something wrong compared to the commercial tool, and
that naturally leads to bug fixes that address limitations compared
to the commercial tool.However, with the 0.6 release, the user
demographics seem to have shifted a bit. I'm getting more and more
feedback from users who do not have other tools. Who knows where
this will lead. Comparisons with the big commercial tools are
becoming less significant, though.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> What improvements
for synthesis can we expect from Icarus in the coming year?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> I keep hoping to
make real progress on synthesis. However, no one wants to tell
anybody how it is done, which leaves me to figure it out for
myself. Fortunately, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> figured out most
of what I need to know to infer logic for almost anything you can
express in Verilog. Getting all the technical details worked out
will be a lot of work, though.I'm hoping this coming year to get
the combinational half of the synthesis all worked out. Quite a lot
can be done in this case, and combinational synthesis may be the
bigger half. Synchronous logic is a little harder but requires the
information needed for combinational synthesis, plus some
more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> Today there are many
more commercial EDA tools that are supported in the Linux
environment. Has this situation affected users of open-source tools
like Icarus?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> So far, it appears
not to have had a big impact. The set of commercial tools available
in the Linux environment is still not complete and varied enough.
Having a simulator for Linux is of limited use if your synthesizer
and place-and-route tools are still Windows-only. I see that the
coming year may bring some positive changes, with some recent
announcements of Linux support promising some real change.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> IEEE Std 1365-2001,
the Verilog 2001 language, still seems pretty new in CAD tools.
Have there been issues between the 2001 and 1995 standards that you
had to resolve?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> The 2001 standard
has resolved a few minor issues of the 1995 standard, but mostly
what it has done is standardize, and put into writing, features
that many compiler writers were already implementing. Some of the
real tricky open issues of the language, including event
scheduling, declaration scope and a few others, have not been
addressed. The new features of the 2001 standard don't seem to be
broken, and I've implemented some of them without any trouble.On
the other hand, more complex new features, such as generate
statements and configuration files, will likely be slow to be
adopted. I know it will take awhile for me to get around to
them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> CAD tools often have
external utilities to supplement them. You have supported some
interesting external formats for open-source graphics tools, like
GTKwave. How much work extra work was this?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> Actually, GTKwave is
a tool, and the format is VCD (value change dump). In this
particular case it was very little work for me because the actual
dumper code was submitted by volunteers. Most Verilog programmers
consider waveform output fundamentally important; having a standard
for the format and off-the-shelf tools to support that format helps
very much.This is one of the advantages of standards. A standard
that works allows for disparate vendors to produce bits that use
the standard to interoperate with other bits. There are so many
standards that don't work, we are surprised when we see one that
actually accomplishes this goal.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> A year ago,
compiling speed was an issue. Has the level of quality for the
constituent GNU tools since then helped with improving the
performance of Icarus?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> No, they have not.
The problem was not unique to the GNU tools, though. Compilation
with Compaq and Microsoft compilers was at least as slow. The
simple truth is that large C++ files as an intermediate form was a
really bad idea.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> Do you have in mind
potentially alternative forms of interoperability in Icarus? For
instance, support for Verilog-A or other input formats?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> I have learned to
set realistic goals and remain focused. It allows me to make
consistent, steady progress for years. The target moves, but it is
always just a few steps beyond arm's reach. That means completing
coverage of the Verilog standard proper is still the major goal.I
have tried to design the interfaces to the core compiler and
simulation engine such that related tasks can be done by others,
though. As is the UNIX philosophy, I shall endeavor to improve the
quality of the interfaces, so I can leave practical extensions to
others.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Michael</b></span> What factors do you
feel have most contributed to the success of Icarus?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Stephen</b></span> I've been lucky
enough to have a combination of skills that allowed me to actually
understand what I was doing. Once it succeeded past a minimal
threshold, Icarus Verilog started to take on a life, and feedback
became increasingly more common and useful. Many people seemed to
want this, and encouraged me.Over the years, various people put
concentrated effort into making patches and giving other forms of
feedback. It's hard for folks to keep it up because no one (in EDA)
is paid to work on free software, and free time is scarce and
precious, so I managed and dovetailed the feedback the best I
could.Surprisingly, I think the high price of commercial EDA tools
probably has <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> been terribly significant.
Much (but certainly not all) of the effective feedback I received
came from people who have and use commercial tools. They know best
when I've screwed up. Fortunately for those of us who can't afford
those tools, that feedback is forthcoming and we all
benefit.</p></div></div>
