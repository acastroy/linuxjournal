right on your desktop.</p><p>by Marcel Gagn&eacute;</p><p>
Dare I say, Fran&ccedil;ois, that this 1999 C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie
is transcendent? Sipping a fine wine like this, I am transported to
new planes of existence. Of course not really, Fran&ccedil;ois, it
is only an expression. It is a compliment that I pay the vintner
for such a fine wine. Am I not still here with you in this very
restaurant, looking at the menu for this month's engineering focus
issue?</p><p>Reality and perception are uniquely personal experiences,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, experiences all Linux users may
explore if they wish. One of the great joys of the Linux
environment is the freedom it provides to talented programmers the
world over to create alternative ways of working and playing. Those
of us who merely use, prepare and serve their creations can then
share in those visions as well.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, where are you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>?
Your attention seems drawn elsewhere. Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>! Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. I did
not realize you were already here. Fran&ccedil;ois,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>! Fetch more of this wonderful wine for
our guests <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>. Please sit,
everyone. Be comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois will return momentarily
with more of the 1999 C&ocirc;te-R&ocirc;tie I was just sampling,
er, I mean, subjecting to quality control, of course. It may seem
strange, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but Fran&ccedil;ois and I
were just discussing the nature of reality and perception.</p><p>I have never truly gotten over my first view of a great
fractal landscape. The breathtakingly real mountainous panorama,
with its snowcapped mountains and nestled lakes, made me understand
the sheer beauty of mathematics. If something as complex as a
landscape or a fern or a galaxy could be reduced to a series of
mathematical symbols replayed over and over again, there is
definitely something starkly beautiful at the heart of the
universe.</p><p>Using a little program called xmountains, you can recreate
those dreamlike landscapes for yourself. Go to author Stephen
Booth's web site
(<a href="http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~spb/xmountains" target="_self">www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~spb/xmountains</a>)
and get yourself the latest version of his program. Engineer a
little reality, manipulate it and dress up your desktop.</p><p>With that, it is time to extract and build the source. Notice
that I have created a temporary directory into which the source can
be extracted. The files are, unfortunately, not saved within their
own directory. Building xmountains consists of these simple
steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir temp_dir
cd temp_dir
tar -xzvf xmountains_2.6.tar.gz
xmkmf
make
</pre><p>Then you can copy the resulting binary (called xmountains) to
wherever you see fit (perhaps /usr/local/bin). There are many ways
to tweak the program's output with command-line switches, but in
its simplest form you can just type <b  >xmountains
&amp;</b> and watch the show. A full-screen window will open
up with a randomly generated landscape. Every ten seconds the
landscape will scroll a little bit to the left with newly generated
terrain. To see the available options, use the -h option. Have a
look at Figure 1 for a sample of xmountains' output.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6014f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Mountainous Virtual Reality
</p></div></div>


</p><p>Depending on the window manager you are using, it is possible
to modify xmountains to write directly to the root window, thus
providing a constantly changing fractal landscape. By default, the
code does not allow for this, and the effect doesn't work well on
all window managers. Consequently, the author did not make this
option a default for the program. I decided to go ahead and make
the changes. Perhaps, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, you will try
it as well. The change is an easy one. Modify your Makefile and
look for the line that reads <b  >PROJECT_DEFINES =</b>,
and change it to look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PROJECT_DEFINES = -DVROOT
</pre><p>Now do a <b  >make clean</b> followed by a
<b  >make</b> and rerun the program with the -b switch.
The resulting pixmap will be written to your desktop's root window.
The results under KDE weren't great, but everything worked
beautifully under Window Maker. As they say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, the mileage, it varies, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
</p><p>Creating virtual landscapes is just one of the many
applications of creating art with fractals. If you would rather
just get in there and start generating a little eye candy, you may
not need to install any software whatsoever. Most Linux
distributions come with a package called xscreensaver that includes
a collection of, well, screensavers. What you may not know is that
each screensaver is a program unto itself with its own
capabilities. For instance, drift is a program for drawing
recursive fractal flames. It can be called from the xscreensaver
program or directly, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/lib/xscreensaver/drift -background "Wheat"
</pre><p>This will open a window with drift endlessly generating
fractal flames on a wheat-colored background. The default is black
but you can play with the colors. If you would like a larger
window, (for instance, 800 &times; 600) try adding the -geometry
800x600 flag. Remember that talk about the root window when we
discussed xmountains? As far as window managers go, the same rule
applies here, but you certainly can launch the program to generate
dynamic art on your desktop with the -root flag:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/lib/xscreensaver/drift -root
</pre>


Do you long for the call of nature? A little joke, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. Perhaps mountains are not your thing but, rather,
the untamed beauty of the forest. Maybe a little window in the
corner of your desktop is in order&mdash;try forest from the same
package. The path to the executable will vary depending on your
installation. On my test system, these all live under
/usr/X11R6/lib/xscreensaver.
<pre     class="programlisting">
forest -geometry 300x200
</pre>


When you are tired of this, try hopalong and experiment with
fractal planes. You might also call up julia for some animated
julia set fractals. What is that, you ask? Well, according to the
documentation, the program &ldquo;uses ifs {w0 = sqrt(x-c), w1 =
-sqrt(x-c)} with random iteration to plot the julia set, and
sinusoidally varied parameters for the set, and plots parameters
with a circle.&rdquo; (Aren't you glad you asked?) To round out the
xscreensaver offerings for today, consider one of my personal
favorites, imsmap. Figure 2 offers a view of my rather busy desktop
with many of these programs running simultaneously.

</p></div></div>


</p><p>Your Linux system is a treasure trove of programs when it
comes to creating virtual landscapes of surrealistic art. Another
package that was likely installed as part of your distribution is
netpbm or netpbm-progs. As part of that package, you'll find a
program called pgmcrater that will create a cratered terrain using
fractals, so that you end up with a virtual lunar landscape (as in
Figure 3). Try this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pgmcrater -x 800 -y 600 &gt; crater.out
convert crater.out crater.jpg
</pre><p>The second command is part of the ImageMagick toolset. The
pgmcrater program generates images in a raw portable graphics
format that gets dumped to a temporary file. I then convert the raw
image into a JPEG, a format I can use to set a background image for
my desktop. Incidentally, we could make those two commands into one
with the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pgmcrater -x 800 -y 600 | convert - crater.jpg
&lt;center&gt;
</pre>

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6014f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
      Figure 3. Is it the moon or pgmcrater
</p></div></div>




Before we move away from netpbm-progs, let's look at one more
program, and one I am particularly fond of, ppmforge. This program
generates &ldquo;fractal forgeries&rdquo; (a term coined by Richard F. Voss)
of planets, starry skies and clouds. The images are incredibly
realistic (as real as a computer-generated planet can be) and make
for beautiful artwork. The program allows you to specify the amount
of glacial formation (based on terrain altitude), the angle of tilt
for your planet (in relation to the planet's star), the amount of
polar ice and the time of day (which changes the position of the
day/night meridian). Here's a sample:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ppmforge -hour 10.5 -glaciers .5 -tilt 23.5 -ice .5
-width 800 -height 600 -stars 70 | display -
&lt;center&gt;
</pre>

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6014f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
      Figure 4. Strange, new worlds are yours to create!
</p></div></div>





Figure 4 is a snapshot of one of my generated worlds. The resulting
image is being piped through to ImageMagick's display program
rather than converting it to a fixed image each time. I can then
right click on the image and choose to save it in whatever format I
desire.
</p><p>For those of you who are fans of backgrounds comprised of
blue sky dotted with clouds, ppmforge does the trick as well. Try
this version of the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ppmforge -clouds -width 800 -height 600 | display -
</pre><p>As you can see, inspiration is as close as your desktop.
Fran&ccedil;ois, our guests are thirsty. Please, more wine.
</p><p>One of your humble chef's favorite movies is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bladerunner</em></span>, based on Philip K. Dick's novel
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em></span>, a
fascinating picture of reality if ever there was one. Dick's novel
is the inspiration for our next encounter with alternative reality,
Scott Drave's electric sheep. When you are lost for inspiration,
pull your hands away from the keyboard, wait for this fascinating
screensaver to kick in and prepare for a little electronic
dreaming.</p><p>Here is the premise: when the screensaver starts, your screen
will blank for a moment as the program connects to the server.
Then, an animated &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; will appear. This sheep is actually an
animated fractal frame created by the collaborative processing
efforts of networked clients. New sheep (the resulting animation)
are created every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. It's hard to say that
this is as useful as the Seti@HOME Project (another part of
electric sheep's inspiration), but it is certainly very cool,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>The nature of the high-resolution animations generated pretty
much demands some kind of high-speed internet connection; a 56K
modem may not be sufficient. If you are hungry to try it, may I
recommend that you begin with a visit to
<a href="http://electricsheep.org" target="_self">electricsheep.org</a> for
your copy. Then, extract and build it like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf electricsheep-2.1.tar.gz.html
cd electricsheep-2.1
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre><p>You can start the program and test it without going into
screensaver mode by simply typing <b  >electricsheep</b>.
In this mode, it will occupy the root window background, so you may
have to minimize your active windows. You can also pass the --help
flag for a list of options. To use it as a screensaver with the
xscreensaver package, modify (or create) your .xscreensaver file
with electric sheep listed as one of the programs. In the following
example, I have also set my screensaver timeout to two minutes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
timeout:           0:02:00
lock:                True
lockTimeout:    0:02:00
programs: \
   electricsheep --nick "ChefMarcel"   \n
</pre>


Then, start up xscreensaver with the command <b  >xscreensaver
-nosplah &amp;</b> and wait. Figure 5 shows off one of the
many sheep that appeared on your humble chef's screen.

grows late and we must soon close the restaurant. In order to help
