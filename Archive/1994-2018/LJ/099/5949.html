    These tools have saved us from the drudger of writing tens
    of thousands of lines of repetitive code&mdash;we hope you find
    them useful.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b1ad8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Moving data from one source to another is
not all that difficult in the scheme of things. If your source data
is a tab-delimited file, for example, and you need it in an SQL
relational database, you might write a little SQL definition, then
churn out a C program to read the data from the source file and
write it out to the database. But when you're dealing with a big
project, or in our case, really big, and you find yourself working
with dozens of sources giving you gigabytes of data, writing all
that code gets old fast.
</p><p>To solve this problem, here are two tools to do the job.
Together, they generate database definitions for SQL, write C
header files with your data definitions and function prototypes,
write C code to get data to and from C structures and generate C
code for an XML parser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b1c38"></a>The Human Genome Browser</h2></div></div><p>The human genome is the instruction manual that is encoded in
our DNA. It is made up of three billion pairs of chemical letters,
commonly known by the initials G, C, A and T. The genome data is 24
long strands of these letters&mdash;not exactly light reading. The Human
Genome Browser is a web site at the University of California, Santa
Cruz that gives scientists around the world a visual representation
of this mountain of data. The browser combines the sequence data
itself with higher-level annotations of the function of particular
regions of the genome. Users can locate and zoom in on genes they
are interested in, link to research conducted on that section of
the genome and compare the genomic data with that of other species.
The browser stacks particular types of annotations as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>tracks</em></span> beneath genome coordinate
positions.</p><p>The Genome Browser has an HTML/CGI front end that lets the
user view and (with the help of dynamically generated image maps)
click on genome tracks. Form fields give the user a way to set zoom
level and control the data density of the tracks. The CGI source
code is C, and the genome data is stored in an SQL database.</p><p>There is a lot of data. The browser source code has to deal
with data formats for gene prediction and for similarities between
the human genome and the genomes of other species. Complicating
matters is the fact that we collaborate with at least a dozen
external sources that each have data in their own format. Even if
we don't want to use their data formats internally, we still need
to write a parser to read them in and convert them to our own
format. Probably half of our use of the code generators is to make
it easier to import files from other groups.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b1e48"></a>Enter autoSql</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>autoSql</b></span> generates SQL and C
code for saving and loading data to a database. By using autoSql,
we don't need to write the tedious data definition, which involves
reading and writing code. For example, the browser has around 30
public tracks and 30 experimental tracks. Each track is associated
with a table in a relational database. All of the modules that load
a track table into memory are generated by autoSql.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b1fa8"></a>The XML Connection</h2></div></div><p>Later in the project, we started using XML to collaborate
with a research group in Japan. XML is also useful to exchange data
with other public sites via DAS (the Distributed Annotation System,
a protocol for transferring genomic data over the Internet).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>autoXml</b></span> generates C code for
an XML parser given an XML DTD file. Since XML I/O is even more
code intensive than SQL I/O, autoXml has already proven to be
useful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b2160"></a>Worth Their Weight in Coding</h2></div></div><p>Together, autoSql and autoXml have proved to be invaluable
time-savers. <span   class="bold"><b>autoSql</b></span> has been a
critical workhorse to the browser project. At 1,200 lines, it has
generated fully half the browser program, tens of thousands of
lines of code.</p><p>Although we don't use XML as much as SQL, we've already
broken even with autoXml. In a single project to import data from
the Riken mouse genome annotation project in Japan, autoXml
generated approximately 1,500 lines of code. (It's only 1,200 lines
itself.)</p><p>You can download the binaries for autoSql and autoXml from

automatically generates an SQL table creation script and C code for
saving and loading data to a database based on an object
specification. (See Figure 1 for an overview of this
process.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5949f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Running a Definition File through autoSql
</p></div></div><p>The specification language is a bit quirky, but it has proven
effective for many jobs. We originally developed autoSql for use
with a relational database; it turns out that it generates code
that can load from many flat formats as well, as long as they are
in a text format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x13b2790"></a>A Simple Example</h2></div></div><p>Imagine a simple address book that just stores name, street
address, zip code and state. The autoSql specification for this
would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
table addressBook
"A simple address book"
   (
   string name;
     "Name - first, last, both, we don't care"
   lstring address;  "Street address"
   string city;  "City"
   uint zipCode; "A zip code
     is always positive, so can be unsigned"
   char[2] state;
     "Just store the abbreviation for the state"
   )
</pre><p>If this looks like a bit of a hybrid between a C structure
and an SQL table definition, it's because Jim was switching between
C and SQL when he made the autoSql language.
</p><p>When you run the address book template through autoSql, the
program produces the SQL table definition:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   #A simple address book
   CREATE TABLE addressBook (
   name varchar(255) not null,    # Name -
       first, last, both, we don't care
   address longblob not null,     # Street address
   city varchar(255) not null,    # City
   zipCode int unsigned not null, # A zip code is
       always positive, so can be unsigned
   state char(2) not null,        # Just store
       the abbreviation for the state
                  #Indices
   PRIMARY KEY(name)
    );
</pre><p>and the following C structure definition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
struct addressBook
/* A simple address book */
    {
    struct addressBook *next;
      /* Next in singly linked list. */
    char *name;
      /* Name - first, last, both, we don't care */
    char *address;    /* Street address */
    char *city;       /* City */
    unsigned zipCode; /* A zip code is always
      positive, so can be unsigned */
    char state[3];    /* Just store
      the abbreviation for the state */
    };
</pre>


Typically in C you access a single row of an SQL database at a
time. The row is returned as an array of strings. It is up to the C
program to convert the ASCII representation of numbers to binary
numbers. This is not hard work, but after you've typed in 20 or 30
lines that look something like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   point-&gt;x = atoi(row[1]);
   point-&gt;y = atoi(row[2]);
</pre>


you'll appreciate the following two routines that autoSql generates
for you:
<pre     class="programlisting">
    void addressBookStaticLoad(char **row,
          struct addressBook *ret);
    /* Load a row from addressBook table into ret. */
    /* The contents of ret will be replaced at the */
    /* next call to this function. */
    struct addressBook *addressBookLoad(char **row);
    /* Load a addressBook from row fetched with */
    /* select * from addressBook from database.*/
    /* Dispose of this with addressBookFree(). */
</pre>


The first routine typically is used when you just want to process
one item at a time. It doesn't allocate any dynamic memory, and so
it's quite fast. The second routine saves the structure to dynamic
memory. Since the C structure always includes a &ldquo;next&rdquo; field, you
easily use this routine to build a list of address book entries.
</p><p>The only problem with using dynamic memory is that you have
to remember to free it. While autoSql can't remember to free things
for you, it can generate routines to free a single dynamically
allocated structure, or a list of dynamically allocated structures.
That's what the next two routines do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    void addressBookFree(struct addressBook **pEl);
    /* Free a single dynamically allocated
     * addressBook such as created with
     * addressBookLoad(). */
    void addressBookFreeList(
       struct addressBook **pList);
    /* Free a list of dynamically
     * allocated addressBook's */
</pre><p>Reading structures without having to write code to load them
up a field at a time is nice, but sometimes you need to write
structures, too. <span   class="bold"><b>autoSql</b></span> assumes
that you'll either want to save the structure in a tab-delimited or
in a comma-delimited format. It generates a routine that can do
either:
<pre     class="programlisting">
    void addressBookOutput(struct addressBook *el,
       FILE *f, char sep, char lastSep);
    /* Print out addressBook. Separate fields with
     * sep. Follow last field with lastSep. */
</pre>


and macros that make it convenient to do commas or tabs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
    #define addressBookTabOut(el,f)
      addressBookOutput(el,f,'\t','\\n');
    /* Print out addressBook as a line in a
     * tab-separated file. */
    #define addressBookCommaOut(el,f)
      addressBookOutput(el,f,',',',');
    /* Print out addressBook as a comma
     * separated list including final comma. */
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>autoSql</b></span> generates a routine to
read comma-separated lists. While you are unlikely to call this
routine directly yourself, fields more complicated than simple
strings or integers get saved in the database as comma-separated
lists. This routine allows autoSql to have objects that contain
other objects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x17ab010"></a>Types of Objects</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>autoSql</b></span> has three types of
objects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Simple: objects that contain no variable-sized
arrays.</p></li><li><p>Object: objects that can contain variable-sized
arrays. A next pointer is automatically inserted as the first field
in the C structure corresponding to an object.</p></li><li><p>Table: like objects, but the program generates an
SQL as well as a C definition.</p></li></ul></div><p>Simple objects differ from other objects in how the program
treats array declarations. In the field declaration:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
simple point[3] triangle;  "A three sided figure"
</pre><p>the three points are stored in memory as a C array. If this
were declared instead as
<pre     class="programlisting">
object point[3] triangle;  "A three sided figure"
</pre>


the three points would be stored in memory as a singly linked list.

an XML parser given an XML DTD file. It will generate a structure
for each &ldquo;element&rdquo; in the DTD and populate the structure with
fields for each attribute of the structure. By default, it will
generate a parser that ignores elements and attributes not in the
DTD, but otherwise is a validating parser. If you use the -picky
flag, it will be fully validating.</p><p>The autoXml parser will load the entire file into memory. If
this is a problem you'll have to resort to the lower-level xap
parser, which is much like the commonly used expat parser, but a
bit faster.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x17ac3a8"></a>A Short XML and DTD Tutorial</h2></div></div><p>If you find yourself befuddled by all the acronyms so far,
you're probably new to XML (eXtensible Markup Language). It has a
tag-based format, and a simple example of an XML doc might
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
   &lt;POLYGON id="square"&gt;
      &lt;DESCRIPTION&gt;
         This is soooo square man
      &lt;/DESCRIPTION&gt;
      &lt;POINT x="0" y="0" -&gt;
      &lt;POINT x="0" y="1" -&gt;
      &lt;POINT x="1" y="1" -&gt;
      &lt;POINT x="1" y="0" -&gt;
   &lt;/POLYGON&gt;
</pre><p>Everything in XML lives between &lt;TAG&gt;&lt;/TAG&gt;
pairs. A tag may have associated text, attributes and subtags. In
the example above, POLYGON has the subtags DESCRIPTION and POINT,
the attribute id and no text. DESCRIPTION has the text &ldquo;This is
soooo square man&rdquo; and no subtags or attributes. POINT has the
attributes x and y. POINT also illustrates a little XML shortcut:
tags containing only attributes can be written &lt;TAG
att=&ldquo;something&rdquo; -&gt; as a shortcut for &lt;TAG
att=&ldquo;something&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/TAG&gt;.
</p><p>XML is much like HTML but has significant differences. All
attributes must be enclosed in quotes in XML, while quotes are
optional in HTML. Tags must strictly nest in XML, while HTML allows
tags to be opened but not closed. The tags in HTML are predefined.
In XML the definition of tags is up to you.</p><p>Tags can be defined two ways in XML: by a DTD file or by an
XML schema. There are pros and cons for each method. DTD files are
relatively simple and are recognized by a wide variety of parsers
and XML browsers. On the other hand, DTD files can't express that a
certain attribute has to be numerical. XML schemas are more
complex. They are themselves written in a type of XML, which is
nice in some ways. They are not as widely supported yet. Currently
autoXml only works with DTD files with some modest
extensions.</p><p>Here is a DTD file that would describe the POLYGON format
above:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!ELEMENT POLYGON (DESCRIPTION? POINT+)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST POLYGON id CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT DESCRIPTION (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT POINT&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST POINT x CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST POINT y CDATA #REQUIRED&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST POINT z CDATA "0"&gt;
</pre><p>The DTD has two major types of definitions: ELEMENTs and
ATTLISTs (or attributes). An element definition includes the name
of the element and an optional parenthesized list of sub-elements.
The sub-elements must be defined elsewhere in the DTD with the
exception of the #PCDATA sub-element, which is used to indicate
that the element can have text between its tags. Each sub-element
may be followed by one of the following characters:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>?: the sub-element is optional.</p></li><li><p>+: the sub-element occurs at least once.</p></li><li><p>*: the sub-element occurs 0 or more times.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>If there is no following character the sub-element occurs
exactly once.</p><p>The ATTLIST defines an attribute and associates it with an
element. It is good style to keep ATTLISTs together with their
ELEMENT. Here are the fields in an ATTLIST:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>element: name of element this is associated
with.</p></li><li><p>name: name of this attribute.</p></li><li><p>type: generally CDATA. Can be a reference or date,
but these are not supported by autoXml.</p></li><li><p>default: this contains a default value to be used
if the attribute is not present. The keyword #REQUIRED in this
field means that the attribute must be present. The keyword
#IMPLIED means that it's okay for this attribute to be missing (in
which case it will have a NULL or zero value after it is read by
autoXml).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12b9580.0x17acd48"></a>autoXml Extensions and Limits</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>autoXml</b></span> extends the type
field of ATTLIST to include INT or FLOAT for numerical rather than
string values. Similarly you can use #INT or #FLOAT in place of
#PCDATA to put a numerical type in the text field. If you include
these extensions, please use the .dtdx rather than .dtd suffix on
your DTD file.</p><p>Currently autoXml only copes with DTD comments if they start
on a line by themselves. <span   class="bold"><b>autoXml</b></span>
expects all ELEMENTS and ATTLIST declarations to fit on a single
line. It doesn't handle reference data types beyond saving the
reference ID as a string.</p><p><a href="5949l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. autoXml Code
Generation</a></p><p>Refer to Listing 3 for a complete example of the source code
autoXml generates. In addition to the .h file shown in Listing 3,
autoXml generates a corresponding .c file as well. Each XML file
has to have a root object. In this case the root object is POLYGON
(our DTD as is won't let us have more than one polygon per file).
You can read an XML file that respects this DTD using the
polyPolygonLoad() function, and save it back out using the
polyPolygonSave.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>autoSql</b></span> and autoXml work
well on a range of data, as you've seen, anywhere from an address
book to gene tracks. We hope you'll find these tools useful on your
