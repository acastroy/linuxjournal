<i  >Linux Journal</i> [see
<a href="../082/4428.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4428</a>],
we reviewed the state of open source in electronic design
automation (EDA) with an interview that focused on Stephen
Williams, the author of a leading open-source EDA project, the
Icarus Verilog compiler [see page 80 of this issue for a new
interview with Stephen Williams].
</p><p>We can look back and forward to the benefits that open-source
development methods bring to projects like Icarus Verilog. This
article offers more technical details on design with Verilog, as
well as explores some of the technical basis for the Icarus Verilog
compiler. Also, at the end of this article, we list some excellent
reference books on Verilog, as well as web site addresses where you
can find information on numerous alternative open-source EDA
projects.</p><p>Icarus Verilog is a command-line tool that compiles the
source design, written in Verilog, to the target format. Normally,
the target format is the input to the vvp simulation engine, but
there are other target formats that can be selected at the command
line.</p><p>The obvious first example is the ubiquitous &ldquo;Hello, World.&rdquo;
program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
module test;
initial $display("Hello, World.");
endmodule
</pre><p>This compiles and executes trivially with the command
sequence:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% iverilog -oa.vvp hello.v
% vvp a.vvp
Hello, World
</pre>


The hardware engineer quickly wants to move on to more interesting
examples that reflect the problems of hardware design. A simple
example that tests a model for a counter is typical (see Listing
1). In both the hello.v and counter1.v examples, the compiler is
given a source file that it compiles to a vvp-format output file,
and the vvp program executes the generated file.
</p><p><a href="6001l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. counter1.v
Example</a></p><p>In Verilog programs, modules are the object types that are
created by the designer to model a hardware device. Modules
instantiate other modules and include code of their own to describe
the device being modeled. The designer then instantiates root
modules to represent the entire device being modeled.</p><p>Verilog compilers typically infer which modules in a design
are root modules by noting in the programmer-supplied source which
modules are not instantiated anywhere else. In the hello.v example,
there was only the module &ldquo;test&rdquo;, which was made the root. In the
counter1.v program, the module &ldquo;counter&rdquo; was instantiated by
test, and only test is not otherwise instantiated, so test is the
root.</p><p>With Icarus Verilog, programmers can either allow this
heuristic to guess the root modules or can use -s flags to list
root modules explicitly.</p><p>As programs get larger, programmers need the ability to
create multifile programs and libraries. Libraries are also useful
as vendor-supplied models for commercially available devices.
Icarus Verilog supports automatic libraries in a portable
manner.</p><p>An automatic library format is an industry standard. It is a
directory of Verilog source files, each containing a module per
file with the file named after the module that it contains. For
example, counter.v contains the counter module. The location of the
library is given to the Icarus Verilog compiler with the -y flag on
the command line or in a command file.</p><p>Using automatic libraries, our counter1.v example can be
broken into two parts: the library modules and the main program. In
this example, it makes sense to move the counter module into
lib/counter.v and keep the test module in our counter2.v program.
See Listing 2 for how to use counter2.v in a two-part
manner.</p><p><a href="6001l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. counter2.v
Example</a></p><p>Icarus Verilog first tries to compile the counter2.v program.
When it gets to the instantiation of the counter module, it notes
that it does not have a counter module definition, searches the
libraries it knows about (from -y flags) and finds the
lib/counter.v file. It parses this new Verilog source, saves the
module definitions it finds and continues to compile the original
source. Library lookups recurse, so library modules may instantiate
other library modules, with the compiler accumulating module
definitions until the program is complete.</p><p>Icarus Verilog has the further convenience of supporting
command files. Command files are text files that contain filenames,
path declarations and other compilation directives. We can create
for our counter2.v example a command file that looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
counter2.txt:
  # this is a private library
  -y lib
  # project source files for this configuration
  counter2.v
</pre><p>And run the program like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% iverilog -c counter2.txt -o a.vvp
% vvp a.vvp
</pre>


For this small program the command file is not much use, but as
designs get larger (hundreds of source files is not unusual) the
command file becomes indispensable.
</p><p>Icarus Verilog also includes a unique feature not available
to other Verilog compilers: the loadable target API. This is a C
API for loadable modules that the compiler can invoke to generate
output in new formats. The vvp code generator is itself a loadable
target module that is invoked when vvp simulation is requested (the
default). There are also the null code generator and the fpga code
generator.</p><p>The loadable target API is available to C programmers through
the ivl_target.h header file included with and installed by Icarus
Verilog packages. This API allows C programmers to write new output
code generators for the Icarus Verilog compiler.</p><p>The vvp runtime also supports a subset of the standard
Verilog VPI interface. This is a runtime C API that allows
programmers to write new system tasks that the Verilog source can
call. Existing examples of system tasks are the $stop and $monitor
statements in the counter2.v example source file. All the standard
core system tasks are written in Icarus Verilog using the VPI
API.</p><p><a href="6001s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
