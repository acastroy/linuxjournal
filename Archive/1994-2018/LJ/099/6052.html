consolidates the embedded Linux arena into three basic categories:
telecommunications infrastructure, handheld mobile devices and
internet-edge devices (this includes server/gateway/firewall-type
devices as well as digital set-top boxes). With the exception of
the desktop, this includes just about everywhere one might expect
to find Linux.
</p><p>Rick has been tracking the progress of Linux in these areas
for the last couple of years, reporting on tradeshows and devices
that, exceptionally, ran Linux. However, that has changed very
quickly, and now the trend that is impossible to ignore in Rick's
columns is that the computing world is increasingly embedded, and
embedded is increasingly Linux.</p><p>As Doc Searls has been saying often of late, &ldquo;Linux has
won.&rdquo; Consequently, the success stories that were so compelling
two or three years ago about some company switching their servers
to Linux have long since ceased to be news. This doesn't mean that
there aren't fights to be fought and progress to be made, but it
does mean that Linux and the open-source development model have
certainly been proven as viable for every level of
computing.</p><p>An indication of the success of Linux was the Open Source
Development Lab's announcement at LinuxWorld, New York earlier this
year of the Carrier-Grade Linux Working Group initiative&mdash;also
discussed by Rick (<i  >LJ</i>, May 2002). The group's
goal is to aid in the creation of any component necessary to make
Linux the best choice for carrier-grade applications.</p><p>In a related event, Ibrahim Haddad, whom many readers will
recognize as a fairly regular contributor to
<i  >LJ</i>, e-mailed me recently to let me know that,
after three years of hard labor, Ericsson is taking some of his
group's work to the Open Source community. Ibrahim works as a
researcher at the Ericsson Corporate Unit of Research in
Montr&eacute;al, Canada. The most important part of the work that
is being open-sourced is an architecture for security on
telecom-grade Linux clusters. It is called DSI (Distributed
Security Infrastructure). Ericsson will be sponsoring its
development and is looking to the Open Source community for help.
They have officially joined the OSDL to work with other members of
the Carrier-Grade Linux Working Group.</p><p>The DSI team has authored an article in this issue explaining
the project (see page 92). The project's web site is not yet up,
but anyone interested in contributing to it may contact any of the
team members listed at the end of the article.</p></div></div>
