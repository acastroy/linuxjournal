Turn your PS3 into a dual-boot game machine and Linux box.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2260580.0x2358348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Can we get the hottest video game system from Christmas 2006 and
turn it into a Linux box? You bet!
</p><p>
If you're still thinking about video game systems as being just a wee
bit more technologically advanced than an old Coleco or Atari 800, you've
got quite a surprise coming the first time you crack open the proverbial
hood. Although the new Nintendo Wii (pronounced &ldquo;we&rdquo;, oddly
enough) has some
slick hardware, as does the Microsoft Xbox 360 device, the real winner
in the technology race is the rather amazing Sony PlayStation 3 system.
</p><p>
Built around an IBM Cell Broadband Engine processor, the PS3 includes
a high-def Blu-ray drive, four USB 2.0 ports, an NVIDIA graphics
processor with 256MB of separate video RAM, support for CompactFlash,
SD and memory stick devices, Ethernet, built-in 802.11b and g, Bluetooth,
an HDMI port and support for all the video resolutions you can imagine,
including 480i, 480p, 720p, 1080i and the holy grail, 1080p. Sounds like
a computer, not a video game system, doesn't it?
</p><p>
The Blu-ray optical drive system boasts support for most of the older
disc
formats too, including CD-ROM, CDR+W, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R and DVD+R. If
you're not familiar with the battlefield of HD video, Blu-ray can support
up to 54GB of data per disk, which is pretty amazing if you're still
using a CD burner! The other HD disk format is HD-DVD, but that's not
supported. On the other hand, Blu-ray already has more than a hundred
movies
in retail channels, so the PS3 is also quite a capable HD video player.
</p><p>
The Cell processor itself is a pretty amazing piece of hardware,
sufficiently so that Terra Soft Solutions (Loveland, Colorado) has worked
with
Sony to create a PS3-based supercomputer center. Imagine, hundreds of
rackmounted PS3 devices running complex weather simulations rather than
WWII games. The Cell processor runs at speeds greater than 4GHz
and can
handle 256 billion calculations per second, with 2.5MB of memory on the
chip itself, squeezed in with a processor design that uses 234 million
transistors (<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell" target="_self">www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell</a>).
</p><p>
One more important spec: with a 60GB hard drive included, the PS3 will
run you about $599 US at most retail outlets, if they even have PS3 units
in stock. And games? Well, there are a few dozen available at this point
with an average price of about $60 US, and the standard game rental
channels
(GameFly, Hollywood Video and so on) should have PS3 games available for
rent
by the time you read this article.
</p><p>
Okay, so it's a darn cool computer with some terrific capabilities
hiding in a sleek black shell, but is it really just useful for playing
video games or can you do something else with it&mdash;can you turn it
into
a Linux system?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2260580.0x2358768"></a>
I Admit, I Liked WebTV</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the most obvious question to ask is why bother? I mean, if you
buy a PlayStation 3, you're going to be investing in the fastest
next-generation gaming console on the planet. Why the heck would you
want to boot in to a sterile Linux environment instead?
</p><p>
Well, the answer isn't because the PS3 replaces your regular Linux box if
you're a geek. To me, the question of running Linux on the PS3 revolves
much more around whether you can essentially add functionality to the
PS3 for households that don't have a computer. What if you could run all
the PS3 games, watch Blu-ray HD movies and gain full interactivity with
the Internet too?
</p><p>
It's the 21st-century answer to the late, underappreciated WebTV device.
Tech geeks never quite got the point that a lightweight device with a
wireless
keyboard that hooked up to a regular TV was never intended to compete
with a $5,000 Alienware Gaming PC. But WebTV still had great utility to
those
people who didn't want&mdash;or couldn't figure out&mdash;a personal
computer,
be it a Mac or PC. Simple, simple, simple. WebTV offered a Web browser
and
e-mail system and not much else, and for many people, that was just fine.
</p><p>
Think along these lines, and Linux on the PS3 suddenly seems like
something
that's worth doing, because the PS3 hardware is so darn powerful and
capable. The
target audience isn't people who could easily run Windows Vista, Mac OS X
Leopard or Linux on a separate computer, but those people who would find
the
lightweight solution just fine. As a result, my primary testing for this
solution are those two killer apps: Firefox for Web surfing and
Thunderbird for
e-mail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2260580.0x23589d0"></a>
First, Configuration Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
Sony actually contracted with Terra Soft
Solutions to produce a version of
its Yellow Dog Linux (henceforth YDL) for the PlayStation 3, a smart move
considering that Linux people were going to cobble together a solution
anyway. Terra Soft initially produced YDL for the IBM-chip-based
Mac
PowerPC systems, offering up a quite capable Linux alternative to Mac
OS X.
</p><p>
The PS3 doesn't include any useful input devices (other than a game
controller), so you need to buy a USB keyboard and mouse or, perhaps,
just dig one out of your closet like I did. You'll also want a USB
Flash drive for a temporary boot drive. Fortunately, I have a 2GB
SanDisk Flash drive that worked just fine. They're about $70 US at your
local computer shop. Ironically, my Flash disk came from Microsoft,
with Vista promotional materials pre-installed&mdash;not anymore!
</p><p>
Start by partitioning the hard disk in your PS3 so you
have space to install Linux. This is pretty easy. Boot up the PS3, then
go to Settings&rarr;System Settings&rarr;Format Utility, choose Format
Hard
Disk, say yes to the questions about reformatting the entire disk, and
then eventually you'll be able to choose a Custom partition.
Choose the Allot 10GB to the Other OS, which still gives you 50GB in
the bigger unit or 20GB in the smaller unit (the 30GB model of the PS3)
for games and other PS3 stuff. We've come a long way from Pong,
somehow....
</p><p>
Now, it's time to turn to your removable drive, whether you're going to
use a
Flash drive like I did or try a CompactFlash, SD card or
similar. You need to create a directory ps3, and then a subdirectory
therein
called otheros, and download two files, one from the Sony Web site
(<a href="http://www.playstation.com/ps3-openplatform" target="_self">www.playstation.com/ps3-openplatform</a>, save it as
otheros.self) and one
from Terra Soft Solutions
(<a href="http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/support/installation/ps3/otheros.bld" target="_self">www.terrasoftsolutions.com/support/installation/ps3/otheros.bld</a>,
save it as otheros.bld).
</p><p>
Armed with both of these files (total size is about 8MB, by the way,
so my 2GB drive is vast overkill), eject your drive from your PC or Mac
and insert it into one of the USB ports on the PS3 itself. You'll also
want to burn a full YDL DVD installation disk based on the OS you can
download for free from the Terra Soft Solutions site, or you can just buy
an installation package that includes both an install and source DVD
disk,
installation guide and lots of additional goodies, including six months
of support, for $99 US.
</p><p>
Now, it's time to install Linux. Let's hope it doesn't mess up my
fancy $600 video game system, eh?
</p><p>
To install, go to Settings&rarr;System Settings&rarr;Install Other OS,
and
the bootloader should be found automatically and be selectable. As always
with the PS3, the X button on the controller selects the specified
choice and lets you proceed.
</p><p>
Uh oh, I hit my first snag, with the bootloader complaining &ldquo;No
appricable [sic] install data was found&rdquo; (yes, they didn't fix the
spelling error). Because the file from Terra Soft initially unpacked
with the filename exoboot, I tried renaming it thusly to see what
happens. Nope, somehow that meant that the PS3 didn't find any possible
external bootloader. Ah, perhaps it's a Mac versus PC problem, because I
downloaded and copied the files onto the USB device with my Mac. Okay,
I reformatted the thumbdrive, redownloaded and re-installed the two
files onto the USB drive with my trusty Windows XP device.
</p><p>
That was the problem&mdash;most confusing, because on the Mac I saw a
download of otheros.bld.gz that unzipped to a file called exoboot,
which I simply renamed to otheros.bld. It was corrupted somehow,
because when I downloaded the two files onto the thumbdrive from the
PC and then tried to install the OS, it worked like a charm!
</p><p>
Now, it's time to tell the PS3 that you want to boot in to the new system,
rather than the default PS3 operating system. This is done by going to
Settings&rarr;System Settings&rarr;Default System and selecting Other OS.
Before you
reboot, however, install the YDL install DVD and hook up
your USB keyboard and mouse.
</p><p>
Flip the power switch to reboot the PlayStation 3, and after a few
seconds,
it'll read the install DVD and pop up with the familiar penguin and a
long stream of boot messages, just as us Linux folks are used to by this
point in time. You'll then get a prompt kboot: at which point you can
simply press Return to boot YDL or type in
<tt  >boot-game-os</tt> to get back to
the world of the PS3.
</p><p>
Tip: you also can reboot into the Game OS by holding down the power
button
for five seconds when you power on. It'll ignore the Linux partition
from then on, however, until you go into the System Settings and choose
Default System&rarr;Other OS again.
</p><p>
After a minute or two of streaming text, you'll get to the YDL Version
5.0 install screen in Anaconda, where you can now start clicking on
Next until your mouse button gets tired. Actually, just a few clicks in
you'll find that the system complains that &ldquo;The partition table on
device
sda was unreadable&rdquo; and asks if you want it to initialize the
drive,
erasing all data. You do want to do that, and as always, I recommend
you choose automatic partitioning.

</p></div></div><p>
The rest of the installation is pretty typical of a Linux system,
with root passwords and so on. All told, it took about an hour to install
everything onto the PlayStation 3 from the YDL install DVD&mdash;perfect
time
to check your e-mail or grab a cup of tea!
</p><p>
Finally, finally, a Reboot button lets me restart the PS3 with its
newly installed other OS. Compared to the
beautiful PlayStation 3 user
interface, I have to say that a Linux reboot sequence is sure
ugly!
</p><p>
Again, as with a typical Linux install, I now see a series of first boot
configuration options, including setting the date and time, specifying
an initial nonroot user and, unlike many Linux installations in
my experience, the YDL for PS3 installation correctly recognizes and
configures the system for the PS3 soundcard.
</p><p>
One login later, and I'm running the X Window System with Enlightenment
as the theme
and find that Firefox is already conveniently installed. Even better,
the system has by default correctly found my DHCP server and configured
itself so that I'm on-line and ready to go.

Surf the Net in PlayStation 3 Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Now, I can start to analyze whether the YDL installation is actually a
configuration that addresses my earlier stated needs for a software
solution
that makes the PS3 a useful Internet machine, and a quick visit to
<a href="http://linuxjournal.com" target="_self">linuxjournal.com</a> confirms that, yes, it works fine,
it's darn fast and
eminently usable. Nice!
</p><p>
One of the sites I use as a test is Google's Gmail service. It's complex
behind the scenes and quite powerful, so the question is always whether
it works and renders properly on a new system. YDL came through like a
champ, working just fine and letting me navigate through my e-mail
securely
through Firefox. Thunderbird is also pre-installed and ready to
go,
and configuring a POP3-based e-mail account is pretty straightforward for
most Linux users, so there are at least two good avenues for accessing
your e-mail.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9597f5.large.jpg"><img src="9597f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Testing Google's Gmail with YDL
</p></div></div><p>
That means, of course, that YDL does indeed meet my primary criteria for
usability, letting me surf the Web and interact with my e-mail, all from
the
comfort of my easy chair and with a simple USB keyboard added onto my
slick
PlayStation 3 device.
</p><p>
But, Linux offers a lot more capability, and as an experiment, I launched
Rhythmbox and quickly concluded that I have had my expectations of
music players really screwed up by using iTunes for so many years. It's
astonishing to me that I can choose &ldquo;Internet radio
stations&rdquo; and not
get a list of available stations, but instead have to figure out the
URL of the station I desire so I can &ldquo;tune in&rdquo; to it.
Unfortunately,
all these years into the Linux evolution, and there are still too many apps
that are rough around the edges like this.
</p><p>
I went to Firefox, searched for &ldquo;internet radio station
jazz&rdquo;, found one
through the popular Live365 site, selected the channel, had it try to
download a streaming file that caused the launch of the Helix player,
only to find that it doesn't have the capability of playing back that
type of content. Next stop: AccuRadio, but it wanted me to install a
new plugin. Yech. New Orleans Jazz channel WWOZ offered up a URL, so I
pasted that into Rhythmbox just to find it didn't work either. To heck
with it! How is someone like my Mom supposed to survive so much
hassle to get audio in YDL?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2260580.0x27521c8"></a>
At the End of the Day, It's a Linux System</h2></div></div><p>
As I expected, it may be slick and fast running on the Sony PlayStation
3 with its powerful Cell processor system, but it's still the same Linux
that we've gotten used to with no exciting new capabilities, no easier
way to work with the various media on the Web, and the same rough edges
I've been bothered by for over a decade now.
</p><p>
Unlike most Linux systems, however, YDL on PS3 at least lets you reboot
and go back into the world of the PlayStation, where you can easily
run photo slideshows, upload and enjoy your music library, watch DVD
and Blu-ray HD video and, of course, play some of the amazing games
available for the PlayStation.
</p><p>
Really, it's one heck of a combination, and if you know someone who
would like to have access to all the power and capabilities of the Cell
processor through Terra Soft Solution's YDL system, along with the fun
and
power of the PlayStation 3, it's really one heck of a combination. Even
if you just want to hack, it's cool to have a foreign OS on the system
as an option at boot time too.
