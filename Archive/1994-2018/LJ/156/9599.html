Step one toward a shell script for Web-based image management.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f5580.0x27ed3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Most of the time when I write shell scripts, it's to solve what I consider
a lightweight problem. Yes, I admit it, if you need to forecast weather,
geomap 50,000 data points or create an on-line shopping cart,
a shell script is probably not the optimal tool!
</p><p>
Nonetheless, when I encounter problems or opportunities for simplification
in my daily work, the first tool out of the box is a shell script. For
some of you, it might be Perl or some fancy PHP coding, but because
anyone who can type commands on the Linux command line is ready to
start scripting, I have to say I still believe shell scripts are a good
starting point.
</p><p>
What's surprising is just how much you can accomplish in a short segment,
and this month I share a script I cobbled together to address
what might be a common problem on your Web server too&mdash;a huge
&ldquo;Images&rdquo;
directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f5580.0x27ed608"></a>
Apache Directory Listings</h2></div></div><p>
To be perfectly candid, the directory listings that are generated by
Apache and other Web servers stink. They're basically
<tt  >ls -l</tt> with no
additional information, no previews, nothing. Most of the time it doesn't
really matter, because most of your site is probably seamless, and people
aren't exposed to the back end.
</p><p>
But, the directory where you might collect all the images, graphics
and photos on your site is most likely a different story. Whether it's
called &ldquo;Images&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Graphics&rdquo;, &ldquo;Photos&rdquo;, &ldquo;Art&rdquo; or what have you, odds are that your directory
is like my own: 1,400 graphics files.
</p><p>
A text-based listing capability is useful if the files have highly
mnemonic names, but wouldn't it be far more useful to have thumbnails of
all the images shown along with their names, rather than only file size
and last-modified dates?
</p><p>
That's what this script does, and like all scripts that are actually
working as CGI scripts, it has to start out by pushing the appropriate
header information immediately:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

echo "Content-type: text/html"
echo ""
</pre><p>
Now that that's out of the way, the rest of the content can be generated in a
loop. In fact, the first skeletal version of the script just duplicates
the file listing capability already in your Web server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

for name in *
do
  echo "$name &lt;br&gt;"
done

</pre><p>
Of course, this output isn't all that interesting. At a minimum, we can
change it so that the filenames are clickable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

echo "&lt;a href=$name&gt;$name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;"

</pre><p>
But, even that's not particularly interesting. Let's add some conditional
code so that images are displayed while everything else just garners
a link. Rather than testing the filename though, let's do something
more interesting and use the unsung command file.
</p><p>
When just run against the contents of a typical image directory, here's
the kind of output you can expect:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ file *
aol-safety-menu.png:       PNG image data, 161 x 230,
 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
apple-ipod-enter-code.png: PNG image data,
 268 x 202, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
archos-av700.png:          PNG image data,
 567 x 294, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
empty.jpg: empty
hentai-manga-example.gif:  GIF image data,
 version 89a, 358 x 313,
index.cgi:                 Bourne shell script
 text executable
teamgeist.jpg:             JPEG image data,
 JFIF standard 1.02, aspect ratio, 100 x 100
</pre><p>
Nice command, eh? It includes the type of the image, dimensions,
depth and any other characteristics it can ascertain.
</p><p>
Most important, notice that &ldquo;XX image data&rdquo; appears consistently with
these images, whether they're PNG, JPG or GIF images. By using this,
we can avoid all the hassles with JPG vs. JPEG, JPG vs. jpg,
Gif vs. GIF and on and on.
</p><p>
Now, the little loop looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

for name in *
do
  if [ ! -z "$(file $name | grep 'image data')" ] ; then
    echo "$name &lt;br&gt;"
  fi
done

</pre><p>
This is enough so that the files that aren't images, even empty.jpg, which
is a zero-byte file, are skipped automatically:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

$ sh index.cgi
Content-type: text/html

aol-safety-menu.png &lt;br&gt;
apple-ipod-enter-code.png &lt;br&gt;
archos-av700.png &lt;br&gt;
hentai-manga-example.gif &lt;br&gt;
teamgeist.jpg &lt;br&gt;

</pre><p>
Finally, we're getting somewhere, because now we can differentiate between
the files that actually are images, and the files that are other
sorts of data.
</p><p>
One last refinement before I wrap this up: instead of just showing the
links as clickable, let's actually output clickable links for non-images,
and make the images themselves clickable. This can be done as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">

for name in *
do
  if [ ! -z "$(file $name | grep 'image data')" ] ; then
    echo "&lt;a href=$name&gt;&lt;img "
    echo "src=$name&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;$name&lt;hr&gt;"
  else
    echo "&lt;a href=$name&gt;$name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;hr&gt;"
  fi
done

</pre>
</p><p>
If the images aren't too large, this starts to look pretty nice, as you
can see in Figure 1. If they are big images, however, it doesn't
work quite as well. So, next month I'll show you some refinements to this
script, including how we can have more than one image appear on a line.
