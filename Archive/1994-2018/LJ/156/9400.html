A new cryptographic filesystem in the Linux kernel uses stacking
technology.

The media has been delivering a seemingly endless stream of reports of
lost or stolen laptops, backup tapes, hard drives and servers from
government and corporate facilities. These devices often contain
medical, financial and other sensitive data. When the storage devices
fall into the wrong hands, attackers can access the data directly,
completely bypassing the access control mechanisms in place in the
organization's network. Reports indicate that millions of people
already have been affected by such compromises. As a result, customers and
citizens are at an increasing risk of identify fraud and loss of
privacy.
</p><p>
Although the cryptographic technology to protect data confidentiality has
existed for decades, many organizations have failed to integrate this
technology into their processes for handling sensitive data. In cases
where cryptography is included in that process, it is frequently obtrusive,
costly and complicated. Organizations sometimes neglect to establish
data encryption policies, and employees often ignore such policies
once they are in place.
</p><p>
In cases where employees attempt to utilize cryptography, they often
use it ineffectively. For instance, they often select weak keys, and
it is easy to save or transfer data inadvertently in unencrypted form
through insecure media (such as Web e-mail or a USB Flash drive).
Security strategies that depend on individual applications performing
their own encryption often fail when the user copies and pastes
sensitive information to other applications that do not have
cryptographic capability.
</p><p>
Data encryption needs to be made ubiquitous, transparent, flexible,
easily deployable, integrated into the data handling process and, of
course, secure enough to counter sophisticated attacks. These
properties need to be in effect regardless of the particular
applications accessing the data. To make encryption services
application-agnostic, the operating system kernel itself should
provide a system-wide data encryption service for sensitive
information written to secondary storage.

Popular Cryptographic Filesystem Solutions</h2></div></div><p>
Several options exist for filesystem encryption under Linux, all
with various advantages and disadvantages. Device mapper crypt
(dm-crypt) ships with the Linux kernel and provides block device layer
encryption. Loop-AES and TrueCrypt, which must be obtained
separately from the official Linux kernel, also provide encryption at
the block device layer. With block device layer encryption, the user
creates the filesystem on the block device, and the encryption layer
transparently encrypts the data before writing it to the actual lower
block device.
</p><p>
The main advantage of block device layer encryption is that it is
simple in concept and implementation. Another advantage of block
device layer encryption is that attackers learn nothing about the
filesystem unless they have the key; for instance, attackers will not
even know the type of filesystem or the directory structure. Sparse
files can be securely and efficiently supported in filesystems on
encrypted block devices.
</p><p>
Block device encryption can have disadvantages that stem from the lack
of integration with the filesystem itself:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A fixed region of storage must be pre-allocated for the entire
filesystem. Resizing the partition later is often an inconvenient
process.
</p></li><li><p>
It can be difficult to change encryption keys or ciphers.
</p></li><li><p>
There is no flexibility for the block device encryption mechanism to
encrypt different files with different keys or ciphers.
</p></li><li><p>
Applications such as incremental backup utilities need access to the
unencrypted data.
</p></li><li><p>
All content in the filesystem incurs the overhead of encryption and
decryption, including data that does not require secrecy.
</p></li><li><p>
Files must be re-encrypted with a user-space application before they
are transmitted through another medium.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
EncFS is a user-space cryptographic filesystem that operates via FUSE.
User-space filesystems are easier to implement than kernel-native
filesystems, and they have the advantage of being able to
utilize user-space libraries easily. This makes it simple to implement
feature-rich filesystems with less time and effort on the part of the
developer. Unlike block device encryption solutions, EncFS operates as
an actual filesystem. EncFS encrypts and decrypts individual
files. Disadvantages of user-space filesystems based on FUSE include
performance overhead from frequent kernel/user-space context switches
and a current lack of support for shared writable memory mappings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1db2580.0x1eaab88"></a>
eCryptfs</h2></div></div><p>
eCryptfs is a kernel-native stacked cryptographic filesystem for
Linux. Stacked filesystems layer on top of existing mounted
filesystems that are referred to as lower filesystems. eCryptfs is
a stacked filesystem that encrypts and decrypts the files as they are
written to or read from the lower filesystem.
</p><p>
Applications in user space make filesystem system calls that go
through the kernel Virtual Filesystem (VFS). Both eCryptfs and the
lower filesystem (for example, ext3, JFS, NFS and so on) are registered in the
kernel VFS. The operations under the eCryptfs mountpoint first go to
eCryptfs. eCryptfs retrieves key material from the user session
key ring and uses the kernel cryptographic API to perform encryption
and decryption of file contents. eCryptfs may make key management
requests with the user-space eCryptfs d&aelig;mon (ecryptfsd). eCryptfs reads and writes encrypted content stored in
files in the lower filesystem (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9400f1.large.jpg"><img src="9400f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Application file operations go through eCryptfs.
</p></div></div><p>
Application file operations go through eCryptfs, which
communicates with the kernel crypto API, the kernel key ring and the
user-space eCryptfs d&aelig;mon to perform encryption and decryption.
eCryptfs manipulates files in lower filesystems, such as JFS or ext3.
</p><p>
eCryptfs aims to provide the flexibility of a Pretty Good Privacy
(PGP) application as a transparent kernel service. For that reason,
the OpenPGP (RFC 2440) specification inspires the basic key handling
techniques in eCryptfs. This includes the common procedure of using a
hierarchy of keys when performing cryptographic operations (Figure
2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9400f2.large.jpg"><img src="9400f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. eCryptfs encrypts and decrypts individual data extents.
</p></div></div><p>
eCryptfs encrypts and decrypts individual data extents in
each file using a unique randomly generated File Encryption Key (FEK).
The FEK is encrypted with the File Encryption Key Encryption Key
(FEKEK), and the resulting Encrypted File Encryption Key (EFEK) is
stored in the header of each lower file.
</p><p>
The cryptographic metadata is in the header region of the encrypted
lower file. Users can transmit the lower file as is to other
users, and the recipients can access the decrypted contents of the file
through eCryptfs, so long as they have the proper key. This provides a
high degree of flexibility in how the files can be handled while
maintaining strong security.

Using eCryptfs</h2></div></div><p>
eCryptfs requires a kernel component and a user-space component. The
kernel component ships in the current mainline Linux kernel. See
Listing 1 for the minimum kernel options necessary to enable eCryptfs.
By default, eCryptfs uses the AES cipher. eCryptfs can use other
ciphers available in the kernel if you build them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1db2580.0x1eab2c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
Newer versions of the Linux kernel contain more feature-rich versions
of eCryptfs. For instance, Linux kernel version 2.6.19 is the first
official kernel version that contains eCryptfs, and only passphrase
mode of operation is available in that kernel. At the time of this
writing,
the development kernel branch version 2.6.20-mm contains
public key support, so that feature may be now available in more
recent mainline kernel versions. You can determine the features
available in your kernel by loading the ecryptfs
module and viewing the contents of
fs/ecryptfs/version_str under your sysfs
mountpoint.
</p><p>
Popular Linux distributions carry the eCryptfs user-space packages;
follow the software package installation procedure for your
distribution to install the ecryptfs-utils
package. If the eCryptfs user-space tools are not yet available from
your distribution, you can download, build and install the
source tarball. You can obtain the user-space components from the
eCryptfs SourceForge site (<a href="http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ecryptfs.sourceforge.net</a>).
</p><p>
If eCryptfs is built as a kernel module, you need to load
the module:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# modprobe ecryptfs
</pre><p>
At this point, you can begin using eCryptfs with whatever filesystem
you are currently using. To mount eCryptfs, specify the lower
directory for the encrypted files and the eCryptfs mountpoint for the
decrypted view of the files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mount -t ecryptfs /secret /secret
</pre><p>
The first path is the lower directory, and the second path is the
eCryptfs mountpoint. Note that the lower directory and the mountpoint have the same path in this example. These paths can be
different, but I recommend doing a layover mount in order to help
ensure that only eCryptfs has access to the files in the lower
filesystem. This command transforms the given path from the lower
directory into the eCryptfs mountpoint for the duration of the mount.
</p><p>
When performing a mount, the eCryptfs mount helper first attempts
to read in options from the .ecryptfsrc file in the current user home
directory, and then it reads options provided via the command
line. The mount helper interactively prompts for any mandatory
options that are not specified in the .ecryptfsrc file or the command
line. For instance, you may be asked to choose a passphrase and a
cipher.
</p><p>
Once the mount has completed successfully, files written to the
/secret mountpoint will be
encrypted transparently and written to the /secret
directory in the lower filesystem. Encrypted files that exist in the
lower /secret directory and that are able to
be decrypted with the key specified at the time of the mount will be
accessible in their unencrypted form when read from the
/secret eCryptfs mountpoint.
</p><p>
When you unmount eCryptfs and look in /secret, you will see the encrypted lower files. You may first notice
that the lower files are larger than the files viewed under the
eCryptfs mountpoint. The exact size of the lower files depends on
the page size of your host and on the amount of data written. In
general, the minimum lower file size is either 12KB or your host page
size plus 4KB, whichever is larger. This helps ensure page alignment
between the eCryptfs file and the lower file, which helps
performance. The lower file then grows in 4KB increments as data
spills into new 4KB data extents.
</p><p>
The extra space at the front of each lower file contains cryptographic
metadata about the file, such as attribute flags and an encrypted file
encryption key. Having this information in the file contents makes it
convenient to transfer or back up the files while preserving all the
information necessary to access the files later. However, the headers
can take up a disproportionally large amount of space if there are
many small files. Newer releases of eCryptfs can store the data in the
extended attribute region instead, reducing the size of the lower
encrypted files; refer to the eCryptfs on-line documentation at
<a href="http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ecryptfs.sourceforge.net</a> for more information on using this
feature.
</p><p>
If your kernel has public key support, you can utilize one of the
eCryptfs key modules to manage your key. You can check for support in
the version of eCryptfs in your kernel by viewing the contents of
fs/ecryptfs/version_str under your sysfs
mountpoint. If there is support, you will see pubkey listed as
one of the supported features.
</p><p>
Key modules can be selected and parameterized via mount options. If
you want to use the OpenSSL key module, you first need to generate a
public/private key pair to use in eCryptfs. To generate a key pair, do the
following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Run <tt  >ecryptfs-manager</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Select menu option 3.
</p></li><li><p>
Select the openssl key module.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You also need to run the eCryptfs d&aelig;mon in order to manage
kernel-user-space communications; the d&aelig;mon can be started simply
by running the executable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ecryptfsd
</pre><p>
Note that running the d&aelig;mon is not necessary if you are using
only the passphrase mode of operation. Then, assuming you created your key
in /usb-drive/mykey.pem, you would mount with
the following options:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mount -t ecryptfs \
  -o key=openssl:keyfile=/usb-drive/mykey.pem \
  /secret /secret
</pre><p>
Given these options, the eCryptfs mount helper prompts you for a
passphrase that protects the private key contained in the key file.
</p><p>
You can mount the same lower directory with many different
combinations of keys and ciphers (known as a mount context), and that
particular context will apply to any new files created under the mountpoint. For current versions of eCryptfs, files created under any given
mount context will be accessible only when the mount is performed with
that same context.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1db2580.0x22a4170"></a>
Notes on Security</h2></div></div><p>
As with any filesystem, you should make regular backups of your data
when using eCryptfs. This is done easily and securely by unmounting
eCryptfs and reading the lower encrypted files.
</p><p>
eCryptfs protects only the confidentiality of data at rest that is
outside the control of the trusted host environment. You should
use access control mechanisms properly, such as SELinux on the trusted
host in order to regulate access to the decrypted files.
</p><p>
eCryptfs will, by default, preserve all of the information necessary
to access the decrypted contents of the files in the contents of the
lower files themselves. All that is required is the key used to create
the files in the first place. You should take measures to protect this
key. If applications, such as incremental backup utilities, are
configured to read only the lower encrypted files, these
utilities do not need to apply any further encryption to the files in
order to ensure data confidentiality.
</p><p>
If you are using a passphrase, follow common best practices in
selecting and protecting your passphrase (for instance, see
<a href="http://www.iusmentis.com/security/passphrasefaq" target="_self">www.iusmentis.com/security/passphrasefaq</a>). I recommend using
the public key mode of operation instead of passphrase mode whenever
possible. When using a public key module, make a backup copy of your
key file and store it in a physically secure location. Should you lose
your key, nobody will be able to retrieve your data. Do not store
unprotected copies of your passphrase or your public key file on the
same media as your encrypted data.
</p><p>
You are free to choose among the symmetric encryption ciphers that are
available through the Linux kernel cryptographic API. eCryptfs
recommends AES-128 as the default cipher. If you have hardware
acceleration available on your machine, and if it is supported by the
selected cipher in the kernel cryptographic API, eCryptfs
encryption and decryption operations will be hardware-accelerated automatically.
</p><p>
You should take measures to ensure that sensitive data is not written
to secondary storage in unencrypted form. Applications that write out
sensitive temporary data should be configured so that they write
only under an eCryptfs mountpoint. You also should use dm-crypt to encrypt
the swap space with a random key. The details are beyond the scope of
this article, but commands to set it up take the following form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-plain -d /dev/random create \
  swap /dev/SWAPDEV
# mkswap /dev/mapper/swap
# swapon -p 1 /dev/mapper/swap
</pre><p>
SWAPDEV is the swap block device on your
machine (refer to your /etc/fstab file if you
are not sure which device currently is used for swap). You can create
simple boot scripts to set up the encrypted swap space automatically,
run ecryptfsd and perform eCryptfs mounts.
Consult your distribution's documentation for more details on writing
boot scripts and using dm-crypt with a random key to encrypt your swap
space.
</p><p>
Note that current releases of eCryptfs encrypt only the file contents.
Metadata about the file&mdash;for instance, the size, the name,
permissions and extended attributes&mdash;are all readable by anyone
with access to the lower encrypted file. Future work on eCryptfs will
include encryption or obfuscation of some of this metadata.
</p><p>
Using block device encryption together with eCryptfs can combine the
security provided by both mechanisms while offering the flexibility of
having seamless access to individual encrypted lower files, although
this roughly doubles the processing overhead of encrypting and
decrypting the data. If only the contents of the files on secondary
storage require confidentiality, eCryptfs by itself is, in most
cases, sufficient.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1db2580.0x22a45e8"></a>
Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
eCryptfs was designed to support a host of advanced key management and
policy features. The development road map for eCryptfs includes
multiple keys per file, different keys and ciphers for different files
depending on the application creating the file and the location where
the file is being written, integrity enforcement and more extensive
interoperability with existing key infrastructures and key management
devices. These features will become available as they are implemented
in future versions of the Linux kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1db2580.0x22a46f0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
eCryptfs is a flexible kernel-native solution that cryptographically
enforces data confidentiality on secondary storage devices. eCryptfs
can be deployed on existing filesystems with minimal effort. The
individual encrypted files can be transferred to other hosts running
eCryptfs and accessed transparently using the proper key. The eCryptfs
key management mechanism is highly extensible. eCryptfs is suitable to
use as a strong and convenient data-confidentiality enforcement
component to help secure data managed in Linux environments.
