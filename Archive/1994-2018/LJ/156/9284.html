Part II of our series on time-zone processing with Asterisk.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x220f2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I wrote about a system for handling telephone calls with
Asterisk that automatically handled the call depending on the time of day at
a remote location. Use of the system, however, depended on the user
performing the critical task of setting up the remote location's time
with a telephone call. Rather than rely on the user to initiate
the telephone call manually, it would be easier if the call occurred automatically.
</p><p>
If the setup call occurs automatically, the user won't
forget to do it. The initial SIP registration may occur at a very strange hour
in the home location, but the SIP registration occurs because a user has
plugged something in. Therefore, we know the user is awake and can
take a short call. Asterisk provides a management interface that reports
when SIP registrations occur and can be used to take action based on
it.
With a bit of additional processing, a script talking to the manager
can initiate calls only when the SIP registration is &ldquo;new&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x220f4a8"></a>
Introduction to the Asterisk Manager</h2></div></div><p>
The Asterisk Manager reports events processed by Asterisk and accepts
commands over the interface. The form of the interface is a text-based
protocol that separates event reports and commands into clusters of lines
with a key: value format. For example, the registration of extension
300 using the SIP protocol looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Event: PeerStatus
PeerStatus: Registered
Peer: SIP/300
</pre><p>
Before gaining access to the Asterisk manager, clients must
authenticate against the list of administrative users stored in
/etc/asterisk/manager.conf. Once logged in, a client can issue commands
or query the value of variables with a set of lines that starts with a
first line of Action:, followed by a command. Responses to commands
typically start with Response: Success.
</p><p>
Because the protocol is text-based, it can be scripted in a language
like Expect. A component is also available for the Perl Object
Environment (POE), a framework that builds event-driven programs in Perl.
The freely available component provides the base-level response parsing
that would need to be written in Expect, so it is a much more extensible
foundation for programs controlling the Asterisk manager.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x220f6b8"></a>
The Program Core and Inline States</h2></div></div><p>
The main code for the program is simple. POE sets up a system where
state handlers are called in response to program states. A state can be
defined by the programmer or by an external event. The typical flow
through the program is to notice a SIP registration, check to see
whether it has an active time-zone registration and if not, to initiate a
configuration call.
</p><p>
To execute code in response to an event, the POE framework uses a hash
called CallBacks. Every entry in CallBacks defines a state based on
the event received from the manager. When an event matches a callback,
the handler defined for the state is triggered. To set up a trigger
with the CallBacks clause, identify every line in the event and set up
a hash so that the left-hand side of each line of the event is the key
value for a line of the hash. As an example, consider the callback
definition for the SIP registration event earlier:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Event: PeerStatus      register =&gt; { 'Event' =&gt; 'PeerStatus',
PeerStatus: Registered               'PeerStatus' =&gt; 'Registered', }
Peer: SIP/300
</pre><p>
To link the callback to a handler, the inline_states hash has a list of
states and references to the corresponding code to call. Although it is
possible to inline event-handler code, for readability I have separated
the code out into external procedures. Code called in response to a
CallBack cannot be passed arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

123456789*123456789*123456789*123456789*123456789*12
inline_states =&gt; {
     register =&gt; \&amp;register_state_handler,
   },

</pre><p>
Based on the flow of the program, three events are of interest.
First, SIP registration events are used to start the entire process.
SIP registrations typically occur hourly, so it is important to
initiate the call only when a registration is the &ldquo;first&rdquo; registration.
To prevent duplicate telephone calls from being initiated, the program
will request data from both the Asterisk internal database AstDB as well
as the SIP peer information. The second and third events will handle
responses to commands and database queries, respectively. A fourth
event will handle initiating the telephone call after receiving data
back from the queries. The code I am currently using also has a state
defined for unregister events, though it is a stub for an event that I
am not currently using.
</p><p>
The core of the program is only 35 lines, most of which defines the
program event states and shows what code will be used in response to
those states. Note that the state of call is defined by the program
and not by a callback, so the call state can be entered only by the
program itself and not in response to an event from the manager. (A
full listing of the program is available on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> FTP site; see Resources.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">

POE::Component::Client::Asterisk::Manager-&gt;new(
   Alias           =&gt; 'monitor',
   RemoteHost      =&gt; 'localhost',
   RemotePort      =&gt; 5038,
   Username        =&gt; 'autotzcaller',
   Password        =&gt; 'secretpassword',
   CallBacks  =&gt; {
        input    =&gt; ':all',
        response =&gt; {
                'Response' =&gt; 'Success',
        },
        dbresponse =&gt; {
                'Event' =&gt; 'DBGetResponse',
        },
        register =&gt; {
                'Event' =&gt; 'PeerStatus',
                'PeerStatus' =&gt; 'Registered',
        },
        unregister =&gt; {
                'Event' =&gt; 'PeerStatus',
                'PeerStatus' =&gt; 'Unregistered',
        },
   },
   inline_states =&gt; {
        input      =&gt; \&amp;input_state_handler,
        response   =&gt; \&amp;response_state_handler,
        dbresponse =&gt; \&amp;db_response_state_handler,
        register   =&gt; \&amp;register_state_handler,
        call       =&gt; \&amp;call_state_handler,
        unregister =&gt; \&amp;unregister_state_handler,
   },
);

POE::Kernel-&gt;run();
exit(0);

</pre><p>
Two of the state handlers are only stubs. The input state handler
prints out whatever it gets if a debug flag is set, and it is there
for development purposes. It catches any unrecognized events that
come from the manager, and it can be useful when testing that callbacks are
catching the important events. The unregister state handler currently
doesn't do anything, but it is there as a hook to expand if I choose in
the future to take any action based on that.
</p><p>
With the core of the program in place, let's look at each of the states
in the order they will be called through a typical program execution flow.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x220fb88"></a>
Registration Event Handling</h2></div></div><p>
The register state handler is called whenever a SIP registration event
is received from a new extension. Its main purpose is to get the data
required for setting up the configuration telephone call when a new
extension pops up. Whether a call is made depends on the state
of the extension as far as time-zone processing, so this routine requests
information to determine whether the extension is registered, its IP address
and other components. To get the extension, we have to take the channel
name, which is prefaced with the technology and a slash (for example SIP/)
and strip the leading part away.
</p><p>
One wrinkle of the event handler is that POE handlers run to completion.
There is no way to interrupt a handler when it is running. The
sub-procedure getTZChannelVars will request information on the time-zone
offset and IP address, but that information will not become available
until the registration handler completes and the responses return via
the manager. At the end of the procedure, the registration handler
uses the delay_set POE method to queue up the call state for a delay
in the future so that the requests will have returned their information
by that point. The delay is set by a global variable in the program.
I have found that one second is more than adequate for a single-user
PBX with only one outstanding extension requiring setup, but the delay
is set to three seconds for safety.
</p><p>
Communication between state handlers is a bit different from that in
a procedure-driven program. POE state handlers pass references to
the POE kernel, which is used in scheduling, as well as the POE heap,
which is needed to issue commands to the Asterisk Manager. POE defines
constants so the heap and kernel are easily accessible to event handlers
as $_[HEAP] and $_[KERNEL]. Any other information available is
located at $_[ARG0], which is a constant defined in such a way that it
is the first argument.
</p><p>
Any lines in the event that defines the state will be passed as the hash
$_[ARG0] and are accessible by asking for the hash key that appears on
the left-hand side of the desired line. In the registration response, it
is possible to get at the peer extension by referring to
<tt  >$_[ARG0]-&gt;{Peer}</tt>,
which returns <tt  >SIP/300</tt>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Event: PeerStatus
PeerStatus: Registered
Peer: SIP/300
</pre><p>
On SIP registration, the program needs to identify the extension, request
information about it and then set up further processing of the extension
data after a delay. When an event is called through the delay_set method,
it is possible to pass an extension to the state handler, such as the
extension number used here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub register_state_handler {
  my $kernel = $_[KERNEL];
  # Split peer extension off from technology
  my $peer = $_[ARG0]-&gt;{Peer};
  debug_print("\tExtension is $peer; ");
  my @exten_parts = split('/',$peer);
  my $ext = @exten_parts[1];
  debug_print("extension number is $ext\n");

  getTZChannelVars($_[HEAP], $ext);

  debug_print("Queuing call event for ");
  debug_print("$REG_CALL_DELAY seconds\n");
  $kernel-&gt;delay_set("call", $REG_CALL_DELAY, $ext);

} # register_state_handler
</pre><p>
As part of the extension registration process, we collect variables about
the state of the channel in the getTZChannelVars procedure. The POE heap,
which is passed as the first argument, can be used to issue commands to
the manager. For example, the put argument to the server can be used
to issue commands. To get the SIP peer data, which includes the current
IP address of the peer, the command looks like this:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$heap-&gt;{server}-&gt;put({'Action' =&gt; 'SIPShowPeer',
                      'Peer' =&gt; $ext });
</pre><p>
To get a database variable, the action in the put command is a DBGet.
The time-zone data is stored as keys in the tz family, so it is necessary
to specify both the family and assemble the correct key name, which is
of the form 300-TIMESKEW or similar:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$heap-&gt;{server}-&gt;put({'Action' =&gt; 'DBGet',
                      'Family' =&gt; 'tz',
                      'Key' =&gt; $ext . '-TIMESKEW'});
</pre><p>
Four database requests and the SIP peer data are requested by
getTZChannelVars. Because this function is called by an event handler,
it also is not interruptible. Therefore, it sends four database
query events to the manager, but it does not process responses directly.
(Complete code for the five requests within the full procedure is
available on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> FTP site.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x2210160"></a>
Command and Database Responses</h2></div></div><p>
In the gap between issuing requests and the time the call state is
scheduled, responses flow in from the SIP data request and the
database queries. From the SIP data request, we need to pick out the
peer IP address, which appears on a line in the manager response
reading <tt  >Address-IP: 192.168.1.5</tt>. Conveniently, the POE module
parses out the lines in the response, so all we need to do is look for the
Address-IP line by getting the value of the Address-IP hash element in
one of the arguments passed to the handler. The POE heap is accessible
across events, so adding the value of the SIP peer IP address to the
heap makes it accessible to other event handlers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub response_state_handler {
  my $peer_ip = $_[ARG0]-&gt;{'Address-IP'};
  if (defined($peer_ip)) {
    debug_print("SIP context found; Peer IP address"
    debug_print("is $peer_ip\n");
    $_[HEAP]-&gt;{'SIP-Peer-IP'}=$peer_ip;
  }
} # response_state_handler
</pre><p>
After the SIP data response comes back, the four database queries should
return responses. Responses to the queries look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DBGetResponse: Success
Family: tz
Key: 300-TIMESKEW
Val: -8
</pre><p>
The callback handler is triggered whenever there is a <tt  >DBGetResponse:
Success</tt> event from the manager, with an argument of a hash that has each
of the lines in the packet. Our interest is in the key and value lines,
which can be retrieved from the arguments passed to the state handler.
As with the previous handler, responses are stored in the POE task heap
to make it available to other handlers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub db_response_state_handler {
  my $family = $_[ARG0]-&gt;{'Family'};
  my $key = $_[ARG0]-&gt;{'Key'};
  my $value = $_[ARG0]-&gt;{'Val'};

  if (defined($family)) {
     debug_print("Key $key in DB family $family");
     debug_print("has value = $value\n");
     # Store in heap
     $_[HEAP]-&gt;{$key} = $value;
  }
} # db_response_state_handler
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2117580.0x22104d0"></a>
Making the Call</h2></div></div><p>
Every registration event triggers a &ldquo;call&rdquo; event to happen after
a delay. The delay is used to collect information used to determine
whether to initiate a call. The setup telephone call should
be triggered only if the time-zone setup has expired or the SIP device has
changed its IP address and the record is no longer valid.
</p><p>
Because the call state handler is placed in the queue for execution by
the registration handler, it does have one argument, the extension number
of the call in question. The extension can be retrieved as $_[ARG0].
All the data we have added to the heap by processing the database
responses and SIP data request is also readily available:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub call_state_handler {

  # Get extension out of arguments to function
  my $exten = $_[ARG0];

  my $hp = $_[HEAP];
  # Variables we use to determine if the call is required
  my $skew = $hp-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW'};
  my $skew_addr = $hp-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW_ADDR'};
  my $skew_start = $hp-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW_START'};
  my $skew_end = $hp-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW_END'};
  my $sip_peer_ip = $hp-&gt;{'SIP-Peer-IP'};
  my $now = time();
</pre><p>
To determine whether the call is required, the handler compares the current
time with the expiration of the time-zone offset record and the IP
address of the SIP device against the IP address stored in the time-zone offset record. If the IP addresses match and the offset has not
expired, no call is required. Otherwise, a call is needed and made with
the makeTZSetupCall function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

 if ($now &gt; $skew_end) {
   debug_print("Make call - offset has expired.\n");
   makeTZSetupCall($_[HEAP], $exten);
 } elsif (!($skew_addr eq $sip_peer_ip)) {
   debug_print("Make call - SIP IP addr changed\n");
   makeTZSetupCall($_[HEAP], $exten);
 } else {
   debug_print("No call -- record OK &amp; same IP\n");
 }

</pre><p>
As a final step, the handler needs to remove the variables placed on
the heap. The heap is used only to pass variables between state handlers,
and the variables are not needed once that function is complete. Each of
the variables can be undefined with the undef function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  # Need to clean up heap
  undef $_[HEAP]-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW'};
  undef $_[HEAP]-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW_ADDR'};
  undef $_[HEAP]-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW_START'};
  undef $_[HEAP]-&gt;{$exten.'-TIMESKEW_END'};
  undef $_[HEAP]-&gt;{'SIP-Peer-IP'};

} # call_state_handler
</pre><p>
Making the setup call uses the Asterisk Manager's Originate command, but
it is protected by one final check. I've defined a set of extensions
as the remote channel list. Only extensions on the remote channel
list will have time-zone setup calls made to them. Initially, the list
consists of my softphone and an analog telephone adapter, but I may need
to add more in the future. Before originating the call, I ensure that the
number is on a remote channel list, which is defined in the global array
REMOTE_CHANNEL_LIST. The Originate command can take several arguments
as well. The extension, priority and context must refer to where the
setup menu is defined. In my case, these values are extension *89 (for
*-T-Z), priority 1 and the context from-internal. I also can supply
the caller-ID text of &ldquo;Time Zone Setup&rdquo; to the phone I am
calling:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub makeTZSetupCall {
  my $heap = $_[0];
  my $exten = $_[1];
  my $callOK = 0;

  # Check that extension to call is a remote channel
  foreach $number (@REMOTE_CHANNEL_LIST) {
    if ($number == $exten) {
      $callOK = 1;
    }
  }

  if ($callOK) {
    $heap-&gt;{server}-&gt;put({
                        'Action' =&gt; 'Originate',
                        'Channel' =&gt; 'SIP/'.$exten,
                        'Context' =&gt; $TZ_CONTEXT,
                        'Exten' =&gt; $TZ_EXTEN,
                        'Priority' =&gt; $TZ_PRIORITY,
                        'Callerid' =&gt; $CALLERID,
                        });
  }

} # makeTZSetupCall
</pre><p>
If the Originate command is triggered, the newly registered telephone
rings, and I go through the voice menu described in last month's article.
