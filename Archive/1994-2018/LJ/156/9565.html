Countless pieces of software, protocols and complex
interdependencies together form a system for which it is difficult to
guarantee any particular property&mdash;particularly security. Even software
specifically designed to enhance security can, at the behest of clever
individuals armed with detailed knowledge, work to its detriment.
Vulnerabilities have been discovered in all sorts of security software from
firewalls to implementations of the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol. For example,
OpenSSH is developed by some of the most security-conscious developers in the
world, and yet it occasionally contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability.
This is an important fact to note because it seems to indicate that security
is hard to achieve and, therefore, bolsters the case for a defense-in-depth
approach. This article explores the concept of Single Packet Authorization
(SPA) as a next-generation passive authentication technology beyond port
knocking.
</p><p>
When an attacker is on the prowl in an attempt to exploit a vulnerability
in server software (as opposed to client software), the first step is
reconnaissance; the attacker needs to locate a target. This process has been
brilliantly automated by Nmap, so it is easy to construct a list of target
systems that may be ripe for compromise. If the attacker has found a zero-day
vulnerability in server software that you happen to be running, you don't want
to appear in this list of targets! Both port knocking and Single Packet
Authorization use a packet filter configured in a default-drop stance and
simultaneously provide service only to those IP addresses that can prove their
identity via a passive mechanism. No TCP/IP stack access is required to
authenticate remote IP addresses via this passive means. Nmap cannot even tell
that a server is running when protected in this way, and it does not matter
even if the attacker has a zero-day exploit.
</p><p>
This article is the first of a two-part series on Single Packet
Authorization, and it lays the theoretical foundation for Single Packet
Authorization and why it is a next-generation passive authorization
technology beyond port knocking. The next article will provide a hands-on
look at using fwknop to provide Single Packet Authorization protection
for your SSH d&aelig;mon.

Introduction to Port Knocking</h2></div></div><p>
Port knocking is a first-generation technology that uses the port
fields within TCP and UDP packet headers to communicate information.
Normally, these protocols are used to encapsulate application layer data, but
port knocking encodes information in sequences of packets to various ports by
using the port numbers themselves as fields to transmit data. These packets
are typically either monitored out of a firewall log or via a packet capture
mechanism, such as libpcap. Typically, there is a port knocking client and a
port knocking server. The terms client and server, in this case (and
throughout the remainder of this article unless otherwise noted), refer to the
software components that send and monitor packets, respectively. The client is
responsible for generating the port sequences, and the server is responsible
for passively collecting the sequences and reconfiguring the packet filter to
allow connections to protected services upon receipt of a valid sequence.
</p><p>
The typical port knocking scenario is for a port knocking server to
configure a packet filter to block all access to a service, such as SSH, until a
specific port knock sequence is sent by a port knocking client. For example,
the server could require the client to send TCP SYN packets to the following
ports in order:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
23400
</p></li><li><p>
1001
</p></li><li><p>
2003
</p></li><li><p>
65501
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If the server monitors this knock sequence, the packet filter
reconfigures to allow an SSH connection from the IP address that sent it. By
making use of a connection tracking mechanism provided by the packet filter
(such as the conntrack system in Netfilter), an SSH session can remain
established after the initial rule created by the knock server is removed
after a timeout. Port knock sequences can be encrypted, and there are many
implementations listed at <a href="http://www.portknocking.org" target="_self">www.portknocking.org</a>. For a graphical
representation of port knocking in action, see Figure 1.

Port Knocking Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
Port knocking offers some real benefits for limiting access to services,
but where do the limitations lurk? First, it is clear that encrypting knock
sequences is important, and this in turn implies that several bytes of
information must be transmitted. For symmetric crypto systems, the encrypted
data will be at least as large as the block size (128 bits for the Rijndael
symmetric block cipher chosen for the Advanced Encryption Standard). For
asymmetric crypto systems, the encrypted data will be substantially larger.
</p><p>
For instance, the raw ElGamal algorithm used by GnuPG doubles the plain-text
size when encrypting data. Even
though GnuPG also utilizes compression
(which can sometimes reduce the size of the cipher text to below the original
size of the plain text), the typically large key size of GnuPG keys implies
that the cipher text for even the smallest messages will be in the hundreds of
bytes.
</p><p>
This has important implications for port knocking. Each packet within
a port knock sequence can send only two bytes of information due to the
16-bit-wide port fields in the TCP and UDP headers. (This assumes that other
fields within packet headers are not also used to
transmit data. However, even if other fields are used, this still cannot
result in nearly as much data transmission as using packet payloads.)
Hence, for a block cipher,
an encrypted sequence must contain at least B/(2*8) packets, where B is the
block size in bits. This by itself would not be so bad when considering the
general speed and reliability of today's networks, but the real issue is
out-of-order delivery.
</p><p>
Decrypting garbled data results in garbled data, and
because there is no notion of a &ldquo;connection&rdquo; (in the TCP sense) between the
port knock client and server, the server has no ability to re-order
out-of-order packets.
</p><p>
Packets may take different routing paths, some of which may
be slow. Hence, the client must resort to an artificial mechanism to try
to
reduce the potential for out-of-order delivery: time. By introducing a time
delay between each packet in a knock sequence, say on the order of a half
second, packet order usually can be maintained by the time the packets
reach the server. Now, for a block size of 128 bits, the corresponding port
knock sequence is 128/(2*8) = 8 packets. By factoring in the half-second
delay, it takes four seconds just to transmit the sequence. For a much larger
message, such as those that would be generated by an asymmetric cipher, this
data transmission rate is simply not practical.
</p><p>
Having a limited ability to transmit data introduces another limitation in
port knocking schemes. It is difficult to guard against a replay
attack effectively. Anyone who can monitor a knock sequence as it is sent from the client
to the server is free to replay the sequence against the server in an effort
to gain the same access. This is an especially important issue if the sequence
is sent through a NAT device, and the source IP that is allowed through the
packet filter at the server side is the external NAT address. For example, if
the port knock client is on an RFC 1918 subnet, say 10.10.1.0/24, and the port
knock server is on a remote network that is accessible only over the open
Internet, the server must allow access to the NAT IP address. Anyone on
the same subnet who can replay the sequence will be granted the same level of
access. Also, anyone on the same subnet has the same level of access once a
rule is instantiated to accept connections from the NAT address as long as the
rule exists (no sequence replay is required in this case, and this remains true
for SPA as well).
</p><p>
There have been variations made on traditional port
knocking to try to provide a solution for the replay problem, such as making
time a significant factor, using S/Key-style hash function iteration and even
simply changing the encryption key after each use. However, each of these
methods requires some state to be maintained by both the port knock client and
server and does not scale very well when multiple users become involved.
</p><p>
An additional port knocking limitation is that it is extremely easy for a
malicious third party to bust a knock sequence just by spoofing an additional
packet into the port sequence as it is sent over the wire by the
client. The
attacker would simply set the source address on the packet to be the same as
that of the real client and choose the same port number as the last packet
sent by the client. This extra packet would break the knock sequence, so
the server would not allow the legitimate client any additional access.
Although the chances that people would actually do this are relatively small
(they still need to be able to monitor packets emanating from the client), the
main issue is that such an attack is so trivially easy to perform. A single
packet is all that is required, and the attacker doesn't even need to be
inline to the original packet data path.
</p><p>
Finally, knock sequences are easily detectable as port scans by any
intrusion detection system (IDS) that is able to monitor traffic between the
client and server. This is particularly true for encrypted knock sequences,
which tend to be longer than simple shared sequences. To an IDS, port
knocking looks just like a series of probes to various ports from a single IP
address within a relatively short period of time, and this fits the
definition of a port scan quite nicely.

Single Packet Authorization</h2></div></div><p>
The end result of the above discussion is that port knocking provides some
real benefits that enhance security, but some serious
limitations also need to be addressed. Single Packet Authorization is a
relatively new protocol that retains all of the benefits of port knocking, but
fixes the limitations discussed above. The first publicly available SPA
implementation was released in May 2005 as a piece of software called
fwknop (<a href="http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop" target="_self">www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop</a>). fwknop was originally
created in 2004 as the first port knocking implementation to combine
passive OS fingerprinting and port knocking (this made it possible to
do things like &ldquo;accept knock sequences only from Linux-2.4
systems&rdquo;),
but the SPA method is now the most popular (and default) authentication
method offered by fwknop. Note that fwknop provides both
authentication and
authorization services, but a full discussion of the difference between
the
two is beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
Single Packet Authorization mandates a similar architecture to port
knocking. Both have client and server components, the server
maintains control of a default-drop packet filter, and the server monitors
packets passively. However, this is where the architectural similarities
between port knocking and SPA diverge.
</p><p>
Single Packet Authorization moves the data transmission to where it
belongs&mdash;in the application layer. This implies that instead of being
able to send only two bytes of data per packet, as in the case of port
knocking, SPA is able to send up to the minimum MTU worth of data (1,500
bytes on Ethernet networks) between the client and the server in each
packet. This far outstrips the data transmission rate possible with port
knocking, and having easy access to this amount of packet data opens
up a huge range of possibilities. The remainder of this article
discusses Single Packet Authorization as implemented by fwknop.
</p><p>
fwknop defines the following packet format at the application layer:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
16 bytes of random data
</p></li><li><p>
Client username
</p></li><li><p>
Client timestamp
</p></li><li><p>
fwknop version
</p></li><li><p>
Mode (access or command)
</p></li><li><p>
Access (or command string)
</p></li><li><p>
MD5 sum
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Many of the fields in the SPA packet format have a variable length, but are
separated by a : character (fields are base64-encoded, so embedded colons
cannot break this syntax). Once the fwknop client builds the packet format
above, the entire packet is encrypted using one of two encryption algorithms:
the Rijndael symmetric block cipher with a 128-bit shared key or the
asymmetric ElGamal algorithm with up to a 2,048-bit public/private key pair
generated by GnuPG. By default, the fwknop client sends SPA packets over UDP
port 62201, but this easily can be changed from the command line; see the
--Server-port argument. (fwknop offers many configuration
options&mdash;see Resources for a link to the documentation and man
pages.) For a graphical representation of SPA in action,
see Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9565f2.large.jpg"><img src="9565f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. SPA in Action
</p></div></div><p>
So, what are all the fields for? First, the 16 bytes of random data
allows one of the highest priority limitations in port knocking to be
solved&mdash;the
replay problem. Every SPA packet is prepended with 16 bytes of random data
before being encrypted, and then upon a successful decrypt by the fwknop
server, the MD5 sum of the entire packet is cached. The random data allows
every SPA packet to be different (even when the same access directive is
sent), so the MD5 sum of every packet also has a high probability of being
different. If the MD5 sum of any new packet matches the sum of a previous
packet, the fwknop server takes no action and writes a warning message to
syslog. Hence, any SPA packet that is intercepted by a third party cannot be
replayed on the network in an effort to get access through the default-drop
packet filter.
</p><p>
The client username and timestamp are placed within the packet by fwknop
and the username is used to maintain different authorization levels for remote
users by the fwknop server. fwknop can be installed on a multiuser system,
and each user can be authorized to connect to different services by a
remote fwknop server. The fwknop version field is used to maintain backward
compatibility. Fields can be added or deleted in new releases of fwknop, but
by using the version number, the fwknop server can remain compatible with
the manner in which older clients build SPA packets. The mode field tells the
fwknop server whether the client wants to access a service or execute a
command (with the specific access control directive or command in the next
field). For example, to gain access to TCP port 22, the Access field would
contain the string <tt  >&lt;IP&gt;,tcp/22</tt> where &lt;IP&gt; is whatever IP address the client
chose to put in the packet. Finally, the MD5 sum field contains the MD5 sum
of the unencrypted packet before the client transmits it. This is used by the
server to verify message integrity after decryption.
</p><p>
We already have seen how the increased amount of data that can be
transmitted via an SPA packet has solved the replay problem and the extremely
low data transmission rate in port knocking schemes. We have two remaining
limitations in port knocking that need to be addressed. First, the single
packet nature of the SPA protocol means that a malicious third party cannot
break the authentication scheme just by spoofing a packet to the same port
over which a monitored SPA packet is sent. Finally, because the SPA protocol
requires only a single packet, it does not appear to any intermediate IDS like
a port scan. All that any IDS can see is an unintelligible blob of data
seemingly spuriously sent to some IP address.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Single Packet Authorization provides similar security benefits to port
knocking in terms of protecting services with a packet filter that is
configured in a default-drop stance. Anyone scanning for a target service
that is protected in this way will be unable to detect such a service is
listening, and this makes even the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities
much more difficult. SPA offers elegant solutions to many limitations in port
knocking implementations. These allow SPA to solve the replay problem,
achieve a data transmission rate that makes the use of asymmetric encryption
possible, thwart simple spoofing attacks and remain under the radar of
intrusion detection systems that are monitoring networks for port scans.
