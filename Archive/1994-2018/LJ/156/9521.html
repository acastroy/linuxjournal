Building a firewall is something that easily can be done using a
Linux machine.
This article describes the basic steps involved in developing a firewall
from scratch, using tools in Linux. It is intended for newbies
interested in learning about (Linux) firewalls. More important,
this article is for all new administrators who would like to dirty their
hands and get a firewall up and running as soon as possible, but
without missing the important concepts en route. My experience in
working on a Linux-based firewall at the DON (Distributed and Optical
Networking) lab, in the department of Computer Science and
Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, is the
most motivating factor behind writing this article.
</p><p>
In this article, we examine developing a firewall that will
sit on the edge, separating your private network from the rest of the
world; therefore, the firewall also will act as a gateway.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9521f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
First of all, why do you need such a firewall? Most
important, you need to restrict access to machines in your
network, a network that might consist of various servers. One
of them might be a mail server, and another might be a DNS server, but only
those particular services (provided by these servers) need to be
accessed, not anything and everything on the network. Putting it simply,
firewalls are used to protect a private network from the rest
of the world&mdash;call it a public network (which is the Internet in
most scenarios).
</p><p>
One less obvious reason for having a firewall is
that it is necessary to block all unwanted traffic flowing into
or through your network, which might otherwise throttle the bandwidth.
Such traffic should ideally stop at the gate (gateway or firewall).
One good example is when there are many subnetworks, such as at a college
or university campus. One of the machines in such a subnetwork could
become
infected with a virus and might flood or broadcast ARP packets.
Similarly, some Windows PCs from outside the private network might be
broadcasting netbios (netbios-ns/netbios-dgm) packets, which are
meaningless to your network and, therefore, should be blocked by the
firewall.
</p><p>
But, some of the ARP packets might be legitimate requests for
machines in your network (or subnet). If you block such legitimate ARP
broadcast requests, no packet (good or bad) will reach your
network, as machines outside the private network will not be able to
obtain the Ethernet address corresponding to the IP address of the
machine in your network. To solve this problem, you should configure
your firewall to act as a proxy for ARP requests&mdash;that is, your
firewall should reply to the ARP requests.
</p><p>
Now, let's get into the
implementation details. Assume your private network is 192.168.9.0/24.
Your firewall, which is also a gateway, must have two interfaces: one
pointing to your network (eth0) and the other
connecting to the public network (eth1).
</p><p>
First, configure the IPs for both interfaces. This can be done
using the network configuration tool or with the ifconfig command.
Ideally, it is better to use the system network configuration tool
(system-config-network in Fedora Core 2&ndash;5) or edit the
configuration files (at /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts in FC
2&ndash;5), so that the configurations are retained even when the
network is started (as part of the boot process) or restarted
(manually). You also can configure the IP by appending the
ifconfig command at the end of /etc/rc.d/rc.local (as this file is
executed at the end of the boot process). If you do this, however, ensure
that these commands are executed when the network is restarted manually.
</p><p>
We use ifconfig to be distribution-independent (for lack of a
better term).
</p><p>
There is no hard and fast rule on the IP addresses to be used for the
interfaces, but generally, the last two IP addresses in the subnet are
used for such purposes. Now, assign 192.168.9.253 to eth0 and
192.168.9.254 to eth1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Configuring eth0"
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 192.168.9.253 up

echo "Configuring eth1"
/sbin/ifconfig eth1 192.168.9.254 up
</pre><p>
The most important function of a firewall that takes the role of a
gateway is to forward packets. This is how we do it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Enabling IP forwarding"
echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre><p>
Earlier, we said the firewall also should act as a proxy for ARP
requests. This means the firewall will reply
to the ARP requests querying for the Ethernet address of any
machines in your network (192.168.9.0/24). Will the firewall send the
MAC address of the machine for which the query was broadcasted (say
192.168.9.8)? No. Instead, it will send its own MAC address, and later,
when it receives a packet for 192.168.9.8, it will forward the packet
to 192.168.9.8 (of course, only if the rules allow the packet to pass
through). Enabling proxy ARP is quite easy in new distributions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Enabling Proxy ARP"
echo "1" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/proxy_arp
</pre><p>
Next, set up the routing entries in the firewall. The private network
is reachable through eth0, although packets to the public network should go
through eth1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Route to 192.168.9.0/24 is through eth0"
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.9.0/24 eth0

echo "The default gateway is eth1"
/sbin/route add default eth1
</pre><p>
Similarly, you have to tell all machines in your network to use
192.168.9.253 as the default gateway (because you have to go through
the gateway to access any machine outside your network). LAN
machines can be accessed directly. Do the following on all machines
(except the firewall, obviously) in your network:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Add default route through the gateway"
/sbin/route add default gw 192.168.9.253 eth0

echo "192.168.9.0/24 is directly reachable"
/sbin/route add -net 192.168.9.0/24 eth0
</pre><p>
Next comes the firewall rules&mdash;rules that protect a network. Rules
are written using the iptables tool. This is a very useful tool,
although a bit complex, with a detailed man page on the various options.
The iptables Netfilter uses three different built-in chains: INPUT,
FORWARD and OUTPUT. Packets traverse through the chains, and therefore,
the rules are written for specific chains. With respect to your
firewall, any packet destined to your firewall (192.168.9.253 or
192.168.9.254) goes to the INPUT chain. If the packet is meant to be
forwarded (that is, it is not for your firewall, and there is a route in
your firewall to the destination), it goes through the FORWARD chain.
Any packet generated by your firewall will go out from the box
through the OUTPUT chain. (This brief explanation is applicable to any
Linux box.)
</p><p>
Although you would never want the firewall to forward every packet
passing through it, you might want to test whether the functionality of the
gateway is working with the above configuration. To do this, make the
default policy of the FORWARD chain as ACCEPT (using the -P
option)&mdash;that is, any packet going through the forward chain is
accepted:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
</pre><p>
A ping request from any machine in the network 192.168.9.0/24 (save,
the firewall) to any (live) machine outside the network will now
return with the ICMP echo reply packet. If the external machine is not
reachable, there may be some problem with the cable or network
card, or you might have misconfigured something.
</p><p>
Now, let's build the &ldquo;wall&rdquo;. The easiest way of setting up a firewall
is by rejecting (DROP) every kind of packet, and then writing rules to
allow (ACCEPT) those packets that you want to see go through. So,
let's make the default policy in each of the chains to drop packets.
Before doing that, clear all the existing rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Flush existing rules"
/sbin/iptables -F

echo "Set the default policy to drop packets"
/sbin/iptables -P INPUT DROP
/sbin/iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
/sbin/iptables -P FORWARD DROP
</pre><p>
By now, you might have noticed that a rule basically specifies some
conditions that the packet must possess. If these conditions are
matched, the action specified in the rule is taken, or else the
next rule in the chain is checked, and this continues until a rule is
matched. If none of the rules in the chain is matched, the default
action or policy (here, DROP) is taken.
</p><p>
Let's write our first rule&mdash;a rule to allow outgoing SSH packets
from the private network:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Allow outgoing SSH"
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p TCP -i eth0 \
       -s 192.168.9.0/24 -d 0/0 --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
This rule is self-explanatory&mdash;well, almost. The option -A
specifies the chain to which the rule is to be appended, and -p
specifies the protocol (UDP, TCP, ICMP and so on). The option -i
names the interface through which the packets will be received.
Because the packets are coming from the 192.168.9.0/24 network (the -s
specifies the source address) for outgoing SSH packets, it will come
through eth0 of the firewall. The destination port (--dport) is 22
for SSH traffic. The destination address is indicated with the -d option,
and
0/0 means any address. Finally, the action for such packets that are
matched is ACCEPT (specified with the -j option), which means allow the
matched packets to go through.
</p><p>
Now, we have written a rule to allow SSH traffic from 192.168.9.0/24
to go anywhere. But, will this work? Will you be able to do an SSH logon
from your private network to a machine in the public network? Where
have we allowed packets to come from the SSH server (in the public
network) back to the client (in the private network)? The following
rule achieves that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p TCP -i eth1 -s 0/0 \
       --sport 22 -d 192.168.9.0/24 -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
This looks fine, but then we need to write such a rule for every
service. Worse, the above rule does more than what is required.
It allows any machine to connect to the private network using the source
port 22. What we should do instead is append a rule that allows only
those packets from the public network that are part of the SSH
connections initiated by machines in the 192.168.9.0/24 network.
</p><p>
iptables maintains state
information to do such connection tracking. The four states
maintained are NEW, ESTABLISHED, RELATED and INVALID. We
won't discuss these states in detail here. For the time being, keep in mind
that state NEW indicates the packet is part of a new connection.
When a response packet is seen in the reverse direction, the
connection becomes ESTABLISHED. Note that this has
nothing to do with the states in the TCP connection establishment process.
An ICMP or UDP reply for the corresponding requests also will mark the
connection as ESTABLISHED. Refer to <a href="http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial.html#STATEMACHINE" target="_self">iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial.html#STATEMACHINE</a>
to learn exactly how the
connection tracking mechanism works. Now (after removing the above
rule), to forward all those packets forming part of the ESTABLISHED
connection, we write the following rule:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Allowing ESTABLISHED connections"
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state \
       ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
This rule ensures that only packets part of an ESTABLISHED connection
will be accepted; a new connection request to 192.168.9.0/24 will
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
be accepted. Ideally, to access any services (such as HTTP or FTP), we
need to allow only NEW and ESTABLISHED connections to go out (NEW will
allow the first packet, ESTABLISHED will allow all following packets
of the same connection), and only ESTABLISHED connections to come into
the private network. Similarly, if you have a DNS server in your
network, which has to be permitted access (queried) from the outside, the
following rule does that (assuming that 198.168.9.1 is the DNS server):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Allowing incoming DNS requests"
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p TCP -i eth1 \
       -d 198.168.9.1 --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
Note that the interface used here is eth1, as the packets from
the public network will be received at eth1. (We have not used -s 0/0,
as it is added by default.) Also, keep in mind that DNS lookup will
succeed only because we already have appended the rule for allowing
ESTABLISHED connections to the FORWARD list (yes, UDP traffic also has
an associated ESTABLISHED state).
</p><p>
So far, we have blocked every protocol except SSH and DNS. It is a
common practice for a new system administrator to block ICMP packets.
This is not a good idea, as ICMP packets are useful for many purposes,
such as for learning the routes between different interconnected
networks in a large LAN, to see if a machine is up, for Path MTU
discovery and so on. So, assuming we are sensible administrators, let's
allow ICMP packets through the firewall:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Allowing ICMP packets"
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p ICMP -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
Earlier, we had blocked any packet to and from the firewall box
(using INPUT and OUTPUT chains). For diagnostic purposes, we can allow
ICMP packets through both chains&mdash;that is, allow ICMP packets to and from
the firewall:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Allowing ICMP packets to the firewall"
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p ICMP -j ACCEPT

echo "Allowing ICMP packets from the firewall"
/sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -p ICMP -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
The ICMP packets also can be rate-limited (as a precaution against
ICMP-based attacks):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Limit ICMP requests to 5 per second"
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -p icmp --icmp-type \
       echo-request -m limit --limit 5/s -j ACCEPT
</pre><p>
We also might choose to ignore ping broadcasts&mdash;that is, ICMP packets to
broadcast addresses, such as ping 192.168.9.255 (ICMP broadcast requests
are used in Smurf attacks):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Ignoring ICMP broadcast requests"
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
</pre><p>
All these rules (commands) will be lost once the system is rebooted;
however, iptables has options for saving and restoring these rules. But, a better
approach is to save the rules in a file (say, firewall.sh), give it
executable permission and append the script name to the end of
/etc/rc.d/rc.local. This way, you always can edit and make
modifications to the firewall script.
