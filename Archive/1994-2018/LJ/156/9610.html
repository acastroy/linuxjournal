How to Make Your USB/MIDI Connection Work with Your Custom-Compiled Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Many of us like to compile our own kernels. In my case, I compile my own
kernels for two reasons. First, stock kernels include initrd images that
tend to discover my SCSI devices in the wrong order. You can fix the
initrd to discover devices properly (I explained how to do that with
Ubuntu/Kubuntu in a previous installment of Tech Tips). But, I prefer
to avoid the problem by compiling the drivers into the kernel rather
than loading them as modules. Second, I just like to run the latest stable
kernel available.
</p><p>
I've been playing with synthesizers with a USB/MIDI connection. Much
to my dismay, I couldn't seem to make the USB/MIDI connection work with
my own compiled kernel. I couldn't find any information on the Web that
would point me to the problem, but I eventually stumbled on the answer
quite by accident.
</p><p>
The solution turns out to be quite simple and obvious once you look
through enough of the kernel configuration options. One problem is that
the kernel drivers are organized in such a way that it wasn't obvious
(at least it wasn't obvious to me) which drivers to include to make this
work. I picked all the MIDI sequencer drivers, so why wasn't it working?
The USB driver you need actually resides within the tree for sound
drivers, not USB drivers. Select the following from &ldquo;make
menuconfig&rdquo;
(or whichever method you prefer for kernel configuration):
Device Drivers&rarr;Sound&rarr;Advanced Linux Sound Architecture&rarr;USB
Devices&rarr;USB Audio/MIDI driver.
</p><p>
Although, as I said, I generally compile my drivers directly into
the kernel, I recommend that you compile this particular one as a module,
instead. There's no point in having the module loaded during those times
when you're not using the synthesizer keyboard.
</p><p>
Select the above driver as a module, and it creates a module called
snd-usb-audio. The module name was the source of my confusion. I found
the snd-usb-audio module when I tried to track down what made the
stock kernel work, but I dismissed this module as a possible candidate
for fixing this problem due to its name. It didn't occur to me that
snd-usb-audio had anything to do with MIDI until I stumbled across the
label &ldquo;USB Audio/MIDI&rdquo; in the kernel configuration. The module name
itself makes it seem like the module is meant for an external sound
source, not an external MIDI source.
</p><p>
By the way, I was inspired to set this up after getting my daughter
a Korg X50, a very affordable and excellent synthesizer keyboard. The
latest Korg keyboards don't seem to require any special configuration
in order to connect the USB/MIDI port. However, I later discovered that
the Yamaha keyboards aren't quite as friendly. You have to change
some MIDI settings on the Yamaha Motif ES keyboards to make the keyboard
work with the computer via the USB port.
</p><p>
This may seem self-evident, but the trick is to follow the instructions
in the Yamaha Motif ES manual for connecting the USB/MIDI to the computer.
Well, duh, right? RTFM, or more politely, read the fine manual. But when
you encounter problems, it's sometimes tempting to look for tips on the Web
to make the keyboard work. Be warned that you should
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> follow many of
the instructions you'll find on the Web. These instructions are generally
for Windows and the Mac, and they'll tell you how to configure the Yamaha
keyboard to send the MIDI signals through the computer and echo them back
to the keyboard. It's probably possible to set up the Linux driver and/or
patch d&aelig;mons (such as jackd) to make Linux applications work with this
configuration, but that's not how Linux behaves by default. So, this is
definitely a case where you should avoid the Web and RTFM instead.

Turn Your Computer into a High-Quality Synthesizer</h2></div></div><p>
Maybe you can't afford even the Korg X50, but you want to try your hand
at composing music or even just playing MIDI files. The problem is
most soundcards that work with Linux do not come with a very impressive
collection of MIDI sounds (such collections are usually referred to as
soundfonts). Free soundfonts are available, but they don't sound as
professional as some of the ones you can purchase. For example, SONiVOX
MI sells a fantastic General MIDI (GM) soundfont, and it's available for
just under $100 US. If you want to use a keyboard to record MIDI sequences,
you can purchase one of many cheap MIDI keyboards that do nothing but send
MIDI signals (they have no synthesizer included). These keyboards sell for
well under $100 US depending on the quality that you'll find satisfactory.
</p><p>
Here's how to use the SONiVOX soundfont. First, purchase the font from
the URL listed below. It has been too long since I've purchased my
copy for me to recall whether the file you download is a ZIP file or
a Windows executable. Even if it's a Windows EXE file, you should be
able to unpack it with Wine.
</p><p>
Now, download and install fluidsynth and the Qsynth front end (it's
as simple as an <tt  >apt-get install fluidsynth qsynth</tt> from Debian and
many Debian-based distros). You may have to load the ALSA sequencer
drivers manually or specify the module in a file like /etc/modules.
The module you want to load is snd-seq, and the command to load it is
<tt  >modprobe snd-seq</tt>.
</p><p>
Start up Qsynth, and you'll see a window like the one shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. The Qsynth Front End to fluidsynth
</p></div></div><p>
Press the Setup button. You may have to configure Qsynth with the MIDI
and Audio tabs depending on the distribution and setup you use.
</p><p>
Now, click on the Soundfonts tab (Figure 2), and click the Open
button to navigate to the SONiVOX soundfont you downloaded and installed.
Click the Open button in the file picker, and you're done. Click OK on
the window, and you should be ready to go.

Run Multiple X Sessions Simultaneously</h2></div></div><p>
On most PCs, you can start more than one X session and switch between
them with Ctrl-Alt-F7 and Ctrl-Alt-F8, for example. Why would you do
this? Well, some X applications don't really need a full-blown window
manager gobbling up your precious RAM and CPU. For example, VMware
Workstation and Stellarium are two applications that I use (rarely
simultaneously, by the way) that don't need anything but a display. I don't
need cut and paste with Stellarium, and VMware is basically a display
manager in itself. In addition, just playing with X in this way makes
you understand the interrelationships between X, your window manager and
your applications.
</p><p>
Start your X engine (aka implicit xinit).
You probably just use startx, and it reads your .xinitrc file and, doing
what it's told, thereby launches X on the first available console, complete
with window manager. This is probably display :0.
</p><p>
Start your X2 engine (aka explicit xinit).
From a terminal, you can launch another X server on your machine:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xinit /opt/vmware/workstation/bin/vmware
 &#8618;-display :1 -- :1 &amp;
</pre><p>
The first argument taken by xinit is the path for the client that will
be launched. It must be an absolute path starting at /. Everything after the
-- is passed to the X server. Read the xinit(1) man page a bit for more fine
examples.

Don't Do Things the Hard Way; Run Remote Applications Using the
Power of X</h2></div></div><p>
It's often extremely frustrating or time consuming to run an xterm on
a remote host just to fork your programs from that remote machine. Why not
simply run your window manager there, even though you're not on its console?
The window manager is just another X application after all, isn't it?
</p><p>
Fire off your local X server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

xinit /usr/bin/xterm -- :1 &amp;

</pre><p>
This yields a vanilla X session with merely an xterm running&mdash;no window manager.
Now, you need to add permissions to this window session for the remote host.
You can tunnel the connection through SSH if your network is insecure, but
there's a distinct performance hit. If your network is secure, you can
simply do
<tt  >xhost +remotehost</tt> and spray directly to your X
server.
</p><p>
For tunneled SSH:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -fY remotehost /usr/bin/wmaker
</pre><p>
For spray directly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xhost +remotehost
ssh -f remotehost /usr/bin/wmaker
 &#8618;-display localmachine:1
</pre><p>
The first option, if your remote SSH server supports it, uses a
locally defined DISPLAY that then gets tunneled to your local side over
SSH. The second option allows remotehost to send X data directly to your
local display, then runs Window Maker there but displays it locally. Now,
all your desktop actions are done on the remote machine, not locally.
