Software developers should know that even geeks sometimes want
to be treated like Mom &amp; Pop.

Many programs often are written that work great 99.999% of the
time that people use them. Or, they work great for 95% of the people
who want to use them. But, for those features or those people on
the
&ldquo;Outer Banks&rdquo;, there is just not enough attention paid nor
documentation
written to satisfy their needs.
</p><p>
In sea lore, the Outer Banks always have held a bit of mystery and
adventure. Usually the farthest piece of land or fishing area, they are
the ones hardest to achieve and offer the most challenges, but they often
have the greatest payback. A definition I like from the Internet calls
the Outer Banks &ldquo;ever-changing&rdquo;, &ldquo;subject to the
whims of the seas&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;demanding environment&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Sometimes it feels like software is that way.
</p><p>
A business proposition I am involved with is based on using a
distribution that is different from the one I had been using for the
past four years, so I decided to switch to the new (for me)
distribution. I have a philosophy that mandates if you cannot
use your own products, you should not coerce others to use them.
</p><p>
I had to do a bit of due diligence in the effort of migration. I ran
the new distribution as a live CD on my notebook, and all of the
devices were found and configured correctly. Unlike my other
distribution, I did not have to go find the wireless network card
driver, and various other aspects of it were set up more or less the way
I wanted them. Initially, I was very impressed.
</p><p>
Also unlike my former distribution, this one had taken a philosophy of
presenting a smaller number of applications to end users in its
menus. The distribution's developers had done analysis and made decisions based on what they
used and what they thought their customers might use. Understanding
this philosophy, I made a decision to use their default mail interface,
which was more integrated and Windows-like than the one I had been
using for 15 years. I should say that nothing was wrong
with the other program I had been using, but it was not as mainstream
as the one I moved to, so therefore, it did not integrate in with the other
applications as nicely. I also wanted to honor the above-mentioned
philosophy of &ldquo;as ye sow, so shall ye reap&rdquo;.
</p><p>
For the most part, I like the new mail interface. It does things
differently in comparison to my old one, but it does have various nice features. It
is well organized, responsive and supports a lot of nested
folders&mdash;something I needed due to my habit of keeping all of my e-mail
history on my notebook so I can work off-line at any time.
(Yes, I do backups frequently.)
</p><p>
Fortunately for me, the new e-mail interface had the capability of
migrating my old e-mail storage into the new format. I had seen this in
the e-mail installation documentation, and I was very happy that my e-mail
could be &ldquo;converted over&rdquo; to the new format easily.
Unfortunately, when
the time came to do this crucial step, the conversion program did not
work. This brings me to the theme of this month's article.
</p><p>
I have relatively simple <span   class="emphasis"><em>needs</em></span> when it comes to
writing an e-mail message, and
I am sure this new interface will satisfy most of those needs when I become
used to it. But, the thing I really needed from the very beginning
was for the import mechanism actually to work. And, not only did this mechanism
not work, but it also did not work in a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>spectacular</em></span> way&mdash;in a way
that made me wonder if the programmers had tried it out even one time
before listing it proudly as a &ldquo;feature&rdquo;. Or, perhaps they tried it out
so long ago that over time (when it stopped working), they didn't
notice it had stopped working.
</p><p>
Of course, importing old e-mail is typically something users
(unless they are system administrators) do one time. After users
have incorporated their e-mail, they go on and &ldquo;just use it&rdquo;. For
programmers to do regression testing of incorporating old e-mail takes
time and effort in setting up a test bed or a methodology for
testing those older systems to make sure the system still
works in the future. Or, they continually have to find people
willing to test the incorporation of their e-mail into the new system.
Or, they have to wait until it fails for someone, and then try to get it
working.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, this last strategy often gives the software overall a bad
name. People who should be using the software never use it, because the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very first thing that should have worked</em></span> did not work. Most people
would not be as stubborn as I am in getting something to work. They
just stop using it.
</p><p>
Fortunately, I am not &ldquo;Mom &amp; Pop&rdquo;. I could look beyond the fact that the
e-mail incorporation did not work properly and quickly formed a
workaround for the problem. Now, I am using the new e-mail interface and
will continue using it, and I will turn in a bug report about the
incorporation problem.
</p><p>
I purposely have not mentioned either the old or the new interfaces that
I am using in this article. The people who know me are aware of the
e-mail interface I have been using for about 15 years. And, those
people who see me using my computer will guess at the new one. But,
enough projects and software exist that work 95% of the
time to make this article applicable to many of them, and it is not fair
to make examples of only these two.
</p><p>
The new interface still has some issues, and I miss
some things from the old one. I intend on working with the developers of the
integrated interface to incorporate the items that make sense in the
&ldquo;Mom &amp; Pop&rdquo; world and document how to do those things that do not make
sense for the majority of the people, but that might be handy in the Outer
Banks. I know I will see some of you in the &ldquo;ever-changing and
demanding environment&rdquo;.
