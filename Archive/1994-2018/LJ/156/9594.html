<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #156, April 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The kernel may soon support a <span   class="bold"><b>larger compiled
binary size</b></span>, if a few
remaining problems can be sorted out. <span   class="bold"><b>Eric
Biederman</b></span> has had some patches to
accomplish this floating around for a while, and <span   class="bold"><b>Vivek Goyal</b></span> at <span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span> has been
testing them out. According to Vivek, the time is now ripe to give Eric's
patches (with modifications and Vivek's own fixes) to a wider audience
and include them in <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>'s -mm tree. A lot of folks seem happy to
see these patches, and much additional work is going into them from
various kernel people. Some of that work is in the form of cleanups, but
some folks also are
working on the tricky interactions between this code and the <span   class="bold"><b>swsusp
software suspend code</b></span>. It does seem as though these patches, sooner or
later, will be complete and accepted into the official tree.
</p><p>
The open-source <span   class="bold"><b>ar5k wireless driver</b></span> has been cleared of any copyright
problems, at least according to the <span   class="bold"><b>Software
Freedom Law Center</b></span> (SFLC). The driver,
developed for OpenBSD, primarily by <span   class="bold"><b>Reyk
Floeter</b></span>, had lived under a cloud of
suspicion by <span   class="bold"><b>Atheros</b></span>, the maker of the wireless chipsets it supported.
And,
although nothing was ever proven against the ar5k developers, the
&ldquo;scandal&rdquo; was
enough to prevent Linux folks from incorporating the driver into the Linux
kernel. With the SFLC opinion, the worst objections have been set aside, if
not entirely eliminated, and now the biggest complaint from kernel folks is
that the ar5k driver may just be badly written or take the wrong approach.
Currently, some folks support incorporating ar5k into the
kernel in its current form or with slight modifications, and some think
the whole driver should be scrapped and just used as a hardware reference
for an entirely new driver. Whichever way that debate falls, it's clear that
Atheros wireless chipsets will soon have a free alternative to Atheros' own
freely available though proprietary MadWifi driver.
</p><p>
A lot of patches have come along to remove broken or unmaintained parts of
the kernel or to schedule their removal after a period of depreciation.
Andrew Morton has scheduled <span   class="bold"><b>FUTEX_FD</b></span> for removal in June 2007, saying the
code has &ldquo;unfixable races&rdquo;&mdash;exactly the charge leveled against DevFS in the
old days. <span   class="bold"><b>Rusty Russell</b></span>, who originally wrote the patch, has no interest in
fighting to keep the code. Moreover, he says that once it's removed, the
futex code could be made a lot simpler. With friends like these, FUTEX_FD
needs no enemies, and it is doubtful the code will last even as long as
Andrew has given it.
</p><p>
At the same time, <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> has posted patches to remove a bunch of old
drivers that have been marked as broken for several years. These include the
<span   class="bold"><b>VIDEO_ZR36120</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>SKMC</b></span> drivers; and the <span   class="bold"><b>MAC89x0</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>ATARI_BIONET</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ATARI_PAMSNET</b></span> drivers. Of these latter,
<span   class="bold"><b>Geert Uytterhoeven</b></span> may
have a patch, by <span   class="bold"><b>Matthias Urlichs</b></span>, to fix the MAC89x0 driver. But the patch
still needs to be tested and signed off on. Meanwhile, Adrian has posted more
patches to remove the <span   class="bold"><b>FB_CYBER FB_VIRGE</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>FB_RETINAZ3</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>FB_ATARI</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>FB_SUN3</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>FB_PM3</b></span> drivers, but it looks as
though <span   class="bold"><b>James Simmons</b></span> might take over
maintainership of those, and Geert may already have a patch to fix the
FB_ATARI driver. So, those framebuffer drivers may not be taken out after
all.
</p><p>
At the same time, the <span   class="bold"><b>sysctl code</b></span>, which to all appearances was on the
chopping block for real, seems to have found a reprieve. Eric Biederman,
who had scheduled the code for removal, found some legitimate sysctl users.
As a result, not only is the code no longer marked as depreciated, but it
also
will be compiled into all kernels by default for the near future. Eric will
work with the various distributions to eliminate the sysctl uses
gradually
and, in perhaps a year or two, will once again consider removing the code.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Sparse C code parser</b></span> never had an official release under its original
maintainer, so it becomes one of a very small group of projects to have an
initial release only after changing hands. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> originally created
the tool in 2003 for his own use to help spot bugs in kernel patches.
And,
he made the tool available for download without ever giving it a version
number or doing any kind of organized release. When users started asking for
features that Linus didn't himself desire, he suggested that someone else
might take over the project. <span   class="bold"><b>Josh
Triplett</b></span> stepped up, officially releasing
Sparse version 0.1 with several feature enhancements. A version 0.2 followed
closely after that, this time mainly adding bug fixes. Is the project old,
having begun in 2003, or new, having just put out its first release? You
decide.

If you're looking to put together combinations of small low-cost
computing systems, it's hard to overlook the goods coming from e-Way, an
American-run Taipei-based company. e-Way specializes in hardware that
sells&mdash;in single units or in quantities&mdash;at prices you could cover
with the average ATM withdrawal. They have a variety of tiny CPU boards
and boxes ranging from $90&ndash;$189 US, plus screens and other
components at prices as low as $8 US. At the Consumer Electronics Show, e-Way
President Steve Freiberger even ran a slideshow off an extremely
compact desktop Linux. The distro and 50 apps&mdash;including the
slideshow software&mdash;all fit inside a 128Mb CompactFlash memory card. Check

<h2 class="title">Governments Vote for Linux Security</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Daniel Frye</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #156, April 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux is the fastest growing operating system in the world, in large part
because customers in every industry are demanding highly secure
information technology environments, particularly those customers in the
public sector.
</p><p>
Worldwide, more than 225 IBM government customers are embracing Linux to
lower the total cost of computing, consolidate workloads, increase
efficiency and enact e-government transformation. But, it's the inherent
higher level of security that is providing government agencies the
confidence to expand Linux beyond edge-of-network applications into the
heart of the enterprise to run mission-critical applications.
</p><p>
Today, thousands of developers and members of the open community
worldwide work on Linux, constantly making it better and more secure.
IBM, for instance, supports the growth of Linux through the work of
IBM's Linux Technology Center, made up of more than 600 engineers in 40
locations worldwide, of whom more than 300 work full-time on Linux as
part of the Open Source community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The inherent Linux security advantage is the added layer of community
approval, which closed systems are unable to provide as they rely
completely on internal teams to avert security breaches. Only after
close examination and approval by a body of peers does a Linux solution
reach a customer. This same talent pool quickly addresses emerging
security concerns, plugging holes and releasing patches before a
company's infrastructure is ever compromised. With other operating
systems, bug fixes and security patches are more likely to be lumped
together and released based on specific timelines that accommodate the
vendor, not the users.
</p><p>
But as e-citizen applications become the norm, the users rule the roost.
Citizens are becoming more accustomed to self-service applications, such
as renewing a driving license on-line or paying a citation.
As the number of citizens accessing information on-line grows, so does
the incidence of cyber crimes. Crackers, phreakers and identity thieves
keep abreast of technology advances, increasing their sophistication.
</p><p>
This now poses significant new threats to governments where the chief
concern includes safeguarding national security and information privacy.
As citizens share sensitive information, including names, date of birth,
addresses and social security numbers with e-government systems, there
needs to be a check in place to ensure this information is guarded by
the highest levels of security.
</p><p>
As a result, advances in Linux security continue to improve, especially
in the affordability of implementing higher-level security
architectures. Open-source software provides more transparency and
user control, allowing users to identify and fix security
vulnerabilities as and when they happen, as compared to waiting for
vendors to fix the security flaws.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many government agencies worldwide require IT vendors to adhere to
Common Criteria security certification standards. The Common Criteria is
recognized internationally by IT professionals as the ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 15408) used by the United States government and other
organizations to assess security and assurance of technology products.
The world's largest Linux enterprise server distribution vendors, Novell
and Red Hat, for instance, have achieved high levels of security
certification that enable Linux to be adopted by governments and
government agencies running on multiple IBM software and hardware
platforms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Advances in security continue to improve, especially in the
affordability of implementing higher-level security architectures. For
use within governments, one resource has been the use of Security-Enhanced (SE) Linux. The Mandatory Access Control provides access to
information on a need-to-know basis, protecting governments better
from potential cracker and virus threats.
</p><p>
IBM has been a key enabler, consistently supporting the growth of SELinux
while simultaneously ensuring that security within the platform is
hardened, maintained and enhanced without compromising access and
ease of use. IBM recently worked with the UK Cabinet Office and partners
Tresys and Belmin Group on the first pilot for Mandatory Access Control
through Security-Enhanced Linux in an e-procurement application at a
National Health Service hospital trust in England. Through the use of
this technology, any organization will have the ability to contain
crackers, provide the necessary confinement for its applications and
minimize damage to the enterprise.
</p><p>
For years, customers have demanded secure, open, interoperable platforms
that are easier to manage and more flexible in running different
workloads in a heterogeneous architecture that often comprises disparate
products from multiple IT vendors. This trend is particularly pervasive
in emerging markets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
India has been a shining star for open-source Linux software, with
growth rates for sales doubling in the past year alone. The government
and defense sectors have been one of the key drivers for Linux adoption
in India, which combined accounted for 38% of the Linux market
during 2005&ndash;2006 according to Dataquest. In India, customers are
flocking to Linux because it provides a low-cost, highly secure and
customizable alternative to closed systems and vendor lock-in.
</p><p>
Just this month (January 2007), it was reported that Tamil Nadu, one of the largest and
most industrialized states in India with a population the size of the
UK, is moving away from a closed system in favor of open source. They
also are training 30,000 government officials on Linux, a key move
because technical skills have been one of the barriers to further
adoption of open-source software. Recently, the state of Kerala, which
boasts a 100% literacy rate, announced it was migrating to Linux
as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
With the growth of on-line government services, citizens are benefiting
from new open-source software security initiatives that are aimed at
helping protect their personal information. IBM, Harvard Law School's
Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Novell and Parity Communications
are working on an open-source initiative, code-named Higgins, that
will spawn a new generation of security software, giving people more
control over personal on-line identity information.
</p><p>
The Higgins initiative is developing software for user-centric
identity management, an emerging trend in security software.
User-centric identity management enables individuals to manage
and control their on-line personal information actively, such as bank account
numbers, medical records, telephone numbers and credit-card
numbers&mdash;rather than institutions managing that information as they do today.
People will decide what information they want shared with trusted on-line
Web sites that use the software.
</p><p>
The user will play a key role in the future in helping enterprises and
institutions comply with various e-governance regulations. As users
have more and more access to e-citizen services, user-centric management
will help in identifying the information individuals want to share,
for instance to their healthcare provider. A healthcare provider does
not necessarily need to know the user's personal information and will
have access to information relevant to the patient's medical history,
thus limiting the exposure to data loss.
</p><p>
The Higgins initiative moves on-line security to the next stage by
creating an open, highly secure and flexible software platform that
essentially puts the user in the center of the identity management
cosmos.
</p><p>
Linux is continuing to become an unstoppable force in the public sector,
helping provide government agencies and the citizens they serve
worldwide a computer operating system both can trust.

<h2 class="title">Widening the Analog Hole</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #156, April 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The entertainment industry embraced the digital revolution by making
digital goods behave like analog ones&mdash;that is, scarce and hard to
reproduce. It narrowed reproducibility of its &ldquo;content&rdquo; until all that
remained was what it ironically called &ldquo;the analog hole&rdquo;. Only through
the analog hole could scarcified digital goods still be moved with
relative ease, and without being stopped by the DRM police. The moved
goods would not be of identical digital quality, but they risked looking
and sounding good enough to please the user.
</p><p>
Naturally, user demand has turned the analog hole into a marketplace.
Front and center are the products by Chicago-based Neuros, which loves
Linux and works to bring the free and open Linux value system to the
world of media production and reproduction.
</p><p>
The Neuros Recorder 2 is an MPEG-4 recorder that &ldquo;works like a
mini-digital VCR&rdquo;. It connects to sources over RCA cables and records in real
time on standard removable Flash memory cards. Content can be transferred
to other devices manually or over a USB 2.0 connection.
</p><p>
The company's latest product is the Neuros OSD, &ldquo;the first open-source
Linux-based embedded media center&rdquo;. It lets you record from cable,
satellite TV, DVD, TiVo/DVR, camcorder or VCR over RCA or S-Video
cables, and to distribute or play back recordings over LAN
(Ethernet), memory card, USB or RCA cables. The architecture is wide
open, and it's constantly improved by Neuros and a growing community of
developers and users. The price is $229 US.

<h2 class="title">Just Say No to OpenXML</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Marco Fioretti</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #156, April 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A couple of months ago, Microsoft and another software company, Novell,
signed a technical cooperation agreement. A part of this agreement may
turn out as highly dangerous for almost all citizens, but it is not
the one that the majority of critics addressed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
With this agreement, Microsoft commits not to sue, for patent
infringement and other &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; violations, the users of
the specific version of Linux packaged and distributed by Novell. One
second after the announcement, Linux and Free Software supporters
worldwide started to explain to each other how absurd and
laughable it would be to believe, even for a single moment, that such
violations actually exist or that any court could ever sentence Linux
end users for them. This week, a handful of public statements (not
even from Microsoft) quickly showed how little such arguments matter
in the real, nongeek world. Wal-Mart's Chief Technology Officer
announced that the company finally will be able to use Linux to
expand its global Web presence, because &ldquo;questions over
intellectual property are a 'huge problem'&rdquo;, but &ldquo;the intellectual
property protections in the Novell deal give Wal-Mart more confidence
in using Linux more broadly&rdquo;. After such a confirmation from
Wal-Mart, which business owner (or Wal-Mart supplier) is going to
listen to <span   class="emphasis"><em>geeks</em></span> swearing that Linux has no hidden legal bombs?
</p><p>
Regardless of Wal-Mart, the worst, most dangerous part of this deal
may not be the patent suits part, but something else with an even
bigger impact on the culture, economy and ownership of public documents.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Interoperability is enormously important in the computer world. If the
documents produced with a computer program are not completely and surely
readable with any other program of the same category, those documents
cannot be exchanged, become unusable after only a few years or remain
available only by paying much more than would be fair to the producer of
the original software.
</p><p>
In order to avoid this, it is necessary to store and exchange documents in a
nonproprietary file format. As explained in &ldquo;Everybody's Guide to
OpenDocument&rdquo;, &ldquo;if computer programs are pens, then think of file
formats as alphabets. There is nothing wrong in selling overpriced
pens, as long as cheap models also exist. But the whole thing is
contingent on everybody using the same alphabet, without needing to
pay fees or learn special secrets.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Today, two file formats are competing for all our office files. One
is the nonproprietary, completely open by design, internationally
ratified standard called OpenDocument. The other is OpenXML,
the format used in the next version of Microsoft Office, which aims to
reach the same status but already has been defined by several experts as
something explicitly created to be usable only in Microsoft Office.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In spite of all this, the file format part of the agreement
explicitly says that it is &ldquo;designed to ensure that customers using
OpenOffice.org will continue to be able to read and write documents
using future Microsoft Office file formats...[Novell will] ensure
that file formats used by future versions of Microsoft Office are well
specified and available to all to implement.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Can you see the problem now? First, the agreement lasts five
years&mdash;it cannot ensure anything after 2011. Next, it is officially
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> meant to make OpenDocument usable in Microsoft
Office. Instead, it is going to make sure that OpenOffice.org users can continue to be
slaves to a proprietary format that is very hard to support
completely in other software programs.
</p><p>
99% of existing office files are Microsoft-locked, and almost all
current desktops are Microsoft. The agreement will actively work to
preserve this situation, practically making OpenDocument (and the very
concept of nonproprietary formats) irrelevant and unused in any large
organization, no matter what its technical and openness merits and
certifications are.
</p><p>
Think of all the large companies and public administrations where most of
the existing partners, customers or suppliers use Microsoft Office
formats. Laziness and the wish to ignore what software is are very
powerful. In such a scenario, the first time a manager sends an
OpenDocument file from an employee or supplier back with an &ldquo;I can't
open this&rdquo; note, the sender will set the default file format of
OpenOffice.org to OpenXML and never go back. Why compromise a career or a
sale annoying people in this way, especially if &ldquo;I can still use this
cool free software, can't I?&rdquo; Sure&mdash;until the agreement expires and
the next version of OpenXML breaks compatibility.
</p><p>
This is the real danger; there won't be any need to sue
anybody for using Linux, because millions of business and public files
will remain in a one-way format, made to order for Microsoft
Office.
</p><p>
This is not interoperability. OpenDocument is interoperability.
Working on OpenXML support in OpenOffice.org also makes it look like multiple
applications <span   class="emphasis"><em>are going</em></span> to support this format. It is a
prerequisite to ISO standardization&mdash;that is, for government
acceptance. Government pressure to require/migrate to OpenDocument
also would be much easier to fight or ignore: &ldquo;Why spend public money
on training, software migration and so on, now that our (current)
format is an ISO standard and even Linux can open the
formats of 99.999% of the existing office files successfully? See how good we were
to encourage competition and give you choice?&rdquo; All this could
sensibly delay the adoption of OpenDocument (not forever, don't worry:
just four or five years). It wouldn't be the first time that
something goes into limbo because Microsoft says that it will support it
in some way and then drops it because &ldquo;there is no market
demand&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Even if you don't care at all about computers, OpenDocument is an
occasion too important to miss&mdash;to save tax money if
for nothing else. Please refuse to distribute or accept office files in
OpenXML formats. It's too risky. Use whatever software you like best,
but just say no to OpenXML, and ask your friends, coworkers and
government to do the same. This is going to be immensely easier to do
than in the past. A plugin to read and save OpenDocument files in
Microsoft Office and a cross-platform viewer (similar to an
Acrobat Reader for OpenDocument) are being actively developed. Very
soon, there won't be any valid excuse not to use OpenDocument.
Don't miss this opportunity.

<h2 class="title">The Market Aperture Opens</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #156, April 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Cinema-grade 35mm film cameras always have been brutally expensive, and
the same goes for their digital counterparts. One reason is just that
they're complex and expensive to produce. Another is that the
manufacturers always have maintained a distance between castes of
customers. Professional gear not only has features and abilities far
beyond those of &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; gear, but it is far more expensive as well.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9594redf1.jpg"></div><p>
This is starting to change with video gear. The RED digital camera
(<a href="http://red.com" target="_self">red.com</a>) is the first professional video camera that makes 35mm-grade
cinematography available in digital form at prices independent producers
can afford. It shoots with a 4,520 x 2,540 resolution (2,540 progressive)
at 60 frames per second RAW, using a 12-megapixel Mysterium CMOS sensor.
It's flexible, format-agnostic and costs $17,500. For something this
good, that's cheap.
</p><p>
Linux has become the platform of choice for much of Hollywood's cinema
production. Does the availability of cameras like RED's beg for more
Linux in the rest of the cine production world? We'll see.

Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and
probably will themselves not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in
hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded
will not die.

Most embedded device vendors don't release any source. Then someone from
the community nags the vendor's legal department for six months and
eventually gets a partial source tree that doesn't compile.
</p><p>
My impression is that companies treat legal compliance not as a hard
requirement but as a risk management exercise; if (cost of GPL lawsuit)
* (probability of GPL lawsuit) &lt; (cost of VxWorks license) * (number of
units), use Linux.

Open sourcing is the most important decision we've made in seven years
of Second Life development. While it is clearly a bold step for us to
proactively decide to open source our code, it is entirely in keeping
with the community-creation approach of Second Life.
