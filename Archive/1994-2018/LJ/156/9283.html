A way to create platform-independent dynamic forms and reports.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb8298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I work for a health-care company developing application software. My
colleagues and I are responsible for writing software to process health-care claims, manage work flow and make the company as efficient as
possible. We recently decided to replace a piece of third-party software
that took health-care claim data and overlaid it on standard HIPAA
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) claim forms. The
software would take the data and transpose it into PDF files that we
stored on a large file server. Each PDF contained one claim on its
proper form. We made the decision to replace the software because we
needed something more agile. We wanted something that would
create the claim image dynamically and not consume space on our servers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9283f1.large.jpg"><img src="9283f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Health Insurance HCFA 1500 Claim Form
</p></div></div><p>
Health-care claims are very intricate (Figure 1). Many boxes and boilerplate text have to be
drawn. The conventional way to do this with a software application is
to draw a series of lines using coordinates and lengths, and then lay the
static and dynamic content on top of the newly drawn lines. The process
of programming an application like this is long and tedious, not to
mention error-prone. We
wanted something that was easier to create and maintain. Our
requirements were as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
We must be able to print high-quality versions of the claims.
</p></li><li><p>
Claims must be accessible from a Web browser.
</p></li><li><p>
The solution has to be programming language-independent. We use Python,
PHP, Perl and Java. The images need to be created using any of these
languages.
</p></li><li><p>
We must be able to convert the claim data and form into several different
file formats, specifically PDF and PNG.
</p></li><li><p>
The entire solution must be platform-independent.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
After reviewing the requirements, we looked at several different open- and
closed-source options. None of them met all of our requirements, so we
turned to creating our own solution. We tried scanning a blank claim form
and using ImageMagick to put the claim data on it. This almost gave us
what we wanted. The problem was that it was going to be tedious and redundant
to create the solution in all of the required languages. Next, we turned
to FOP (Formatting Objects Processor). This solution was closer to what
we wanted. However, it would take too long create the claim forms. Plus,
the solution was not really language-independent either (FOP is a
Java library). We could have written wrappers for the FOP command-line
interface, but we were convinced that there was still a better solution.
</p><p>
While exploring the FOP solution, we had the idea of using Scalable Vector
Graphics (SVGs). Basically, we would take an SVG image of the claim form
and make it into an XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation),
because the SVG format is a special XML format. Then, we would pull the
claim data from our database and convert it into an XML string. Using
any of our languages, we could then take the XSLT and the XML and create
an SVG image of the claim. This solution met all of our requirements. It
was language- and platform-independent. We could print the SVG images
and embed them into Web pages. Furthermore, SVG images can be
converted into different file formats easily. Another nice feature of this
solution is the small file size of the SVG images. If we wanted to
archive the images, they would take a fraction of the space the old
solution did. Because SVG images are text, not compressed binary, the files
can be compressed and save even more space.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb8a28"></a>
Creating the Master SVG</h2></div></div><p>
One of the things that made the SVG solution so appealing was how
easy it would be to create and maintain the master SVG image of the
form. To do this, we would use Inkscape. Inkscape is an SVG-authoring
tool that works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and other UNIX-like
operating systems. Other SVG-authoring tools are available, but we
chose Inkscape because it is open, and it is in the package manager for
most Linux distributions.
</p><p>
The first thing we did to create the master SVG was open Inkscape and
create a new US Letter size document. To keep things organized, we created
four layers in the new document: scan, overlay, boilerplate and dynamic
text. Using the scan layer, we imported a scan of a claim. Doing this
allowed us to line up everything on the Inkscape stage without having to
measure anything. After importing the image, we locked the layer so that
it could not be modified accidentally. Actually, after we were finished with
each layer on the SVG, we would lock it to ensure it was not tampered with.
</p><p>
Next, we used the overlay layer to trace all the lines and boxes
from the original claim that we imported. This step was a little
tricky. When the image we scanned was originally created, the lines
were not spaced evenly for one reason or another. We decided to line up
things correctly on our version. Fortunately, Inkscape has tools to
do this automatically. By selecting all of the objects that needed to be
spaced out (Shift-left-click) and using the Align and Distribute dialog
(Object&rarr;Align and Distribute in the menu), Inkscape fixed the spacing
issues. When finished, we had something that looked like Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9283f2.large.jpg"><img src="9283f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Trace of the Lines and Boxes from the Claim Form
</p></div></div><p>
After drawing all of the lines, it was time to add all the boilerplate
text. For this, we used the aptly named boilerplate layer. Before we
got started, we decided to remove the scan layer completely, because we
no longer needed it. To align the text properly, we used the Guides in
Inkscape. Guides are exactly what the name suggests&mdash;guide lines
that exist only inside of Inkscape for the purpose of aligning objects. To
use a guide line, simply click the top or left-hand margin and drag the line
into place. To get the most out of the guide lines, we enabled the Snap
points to guides feature (File&rarr;Document Preferences&rarr;Guides). Doing
this allowed us to place all of the text exactly in alignment.
Figure 3 shows what the SVG looked like after this step.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9283f3.large.jpg"><img src="9283f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Blank Claim Form Completed
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, we switched to the dynamic text layer and added placeholders
where the claim data would be located. Again, we used the guides to align
everything. For the text place holders, we used a single $ for each
block of text. Then, to make life easier down the road, we renamed each
of the dynamic text objects to something relevant. We did this by
left-clicking on the object and going to Object&rarr;Object Properties in
the menu. Figure 4 shows the final master SVG with the guide lines.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9283f4.large.jpg"><img src="9283f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Final Master with Dynamic Text Layer
</p></div></div><p>
Creating the master SVG took about four full hours of work. I would
venture to guess that it would have taken several days to do this
programmatically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb9210"></a>
Converting the SVG to an XSLT</h2></div></div><p>
Once we had the master SVG finished, it was time to convert it into an
XSLT. Because SVG images are just XML files, we added all of the XSLT markup
with a text editor. Converting the SVG was a rather simple matter. To
make it a true XSLT, only a few lines are required in
the header. Listing 1 shows a few lines of the SVG before we modified
it. Listing 2 shows the same set of lines with the XSLT markup.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb9318"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. A Few Lines of the SVG before Modifying</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;!-- Created with Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) --&gt;
&lt;svg
...
&lt;/svg&gt;

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb94d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. The Same Set of Lines with the XSLT Markup</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;!-- Created with Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) --&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
 &#8618;&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="/claim"&gt;
&lt;svg
...
&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</pre></div><p>
As you can see, there are four new lines. The first new line declares this
file an XSLT. The second new line contains an XPath (XML Path Language)
expression that matches the root element in our claim data XML. This line
tells the XML transform engine where to start reading the XML to do
the conversion. The last two new lines simply close the open xsl tags.
</p><p>
At this point, the XSLT can be used in conjunction with our claim data
XML to produce an SVG. However, the resulting SVG would look just like
the SVG did before we modified it. To make it actually show the claim
data, we had to go into the XSLT and add all of the XPath expressions to
populate the SVG. Because we divided the SVG objects into layers, we
had to modify only the dynamic text layer. In the SVG XML, the dynamic text
layer is nothing more than a series of text tags. Listing 3 shows the
text tag for the Patient's City box on our claim form.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb9738"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Text Tag for the Patient's City Box on the Claim Form</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;text
    xml:space="preserve"
    style="..."
    x="33.237278"
    y="231.77995"
    id="textPatientCity"
    sodipodi:linespacing="125.00000%"
    inkscape:label="#text7272"&gt;
        &lt;tspan
            sodipodi:role="line"
            id="tspan7274"
            x="33.237278"
            y="231.77995"&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of
 select="patient/address/city"/&gt;&lt;/tspan&gt;&lt;/text&gt;

</pre></div><p>
When the XSLT is applied to the claim data XML, the value of
/claim/patient/address/city will be substituted here. We went through
the entire XSLT and added the appropriate XPath expressions where they
belonged. In special cases, we also added XPath conditional logic and
formatting rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb9948"></a>
The Claim Data XML</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned previously, all of our claim data was in a database&mdash;a Postgres
database to be more specific. As we wanted a solution that was not
language-specific, we had to devise a way to get the claim data out
of the database and into an XML format without depending on a specific
programming language. One of my fellow developers had the idea to write a
series of PL/pgSQL functions to return a single XML string that contained
the XML data. His solution was brilliant and fit the bill perfectly. All
we needed to do to get the claim data was run one small query with the
ID of the claim (Listing 4). The result was well-formatted XML that
we used to make claim images.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb9a50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 4. Query with ID of the Claim</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT xe2_claim('09152006A5226');
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb9c08"></a>
Displaying the Final SVG in a Browser</h2></div></div><p>
At first, the primary point of creating this solution was to display claims
in our Web interface. All of our Web applications are written in PHP5
and run in an Apache/mod_php environment. To do the XSLT transformation,
we used the XSL functions in PHP. This set of functions comes as an
extension to PHP. The extension is a front end to the libxslt C library.
</p><p>
The XSLT extension makes doing the transition easy. Listing 5 shows a
portion of a PHP script that transforms the claim XML into an SVG and
displays it in the browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb05f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 5. A Portion of the PHP Script That Transforms the Claim
XML into an SVG and Displays It in a Browser</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
// import the SVG XSLT
$xsl = new XSLTProcessor();
$xsl-&gt;importStyleSheet(DOMDocument::load("svg_xslt.xsl"));

// load the claim data XML
// $claim is the database result from Listing 4
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc-&gt;loadXML($claim);

// tell the browser this is an SVG document
header("Content-Type: image/svg+xml");

// print the SVG to the browser
echo $xsl-&gt;transformToXML($doc);
</pre></div><p>
Listing 5 is a simplified version of our solution. In our solution, there
is the possibility of having multiple pages for a single claim. To fix
this, we had to do multiple transformations, one for each page. To get the
multiple-page claims to display in the same browser window, we had to embed
them. This can be done using the embed and object HTML tags. Note
that there are several issues with browser compatibility when using these
tags. To solve the compatibility issues, we wrote a script that checks the
user's browser and decides which tag to use. Then, we set the target object
data/embedded source to a script similar to the one in Listing 5. This
allowed the Web browser to display multiple SVG images in the same window.
</p><p>
Other considerations must be made when using SVG images
in a Web browser environment. Internet Explorer does not have native
support for SVG images. The user is forced to use a third-party plugin to
display the images. Adobe provides one of these for free. Mozilla Firefox
has built-in support for SVG images starting with version 1.5. However,
Firefox does not support several aspects of SVG images,
such as scaling and grouped objects. Fortunately for us, all of our
users use an up-to-date version of Firefox.
</p><p>
That is all there is to it. Figure 5 shows a claim image with all of
the data filled in.

Printing and Archiving the SVG Images</h2></div></div><p>
Once we finished the Web end of our solution, we turned our sights toward
the rest of our integration. This meant we had to print the SVG
images and find a way to archive them. Some clients request that we send
them copies of the claims printed and/or electronically. Because all of
our back-end software is written in Python, it also meant we had to
do the XML transformation in a different language. To do all of the XML
work, we used the 4Suite XML API.
</p><p>
To print the images, we again turned to Inkscape, because our PostScript
printer drivers would not print the SVG images. Inkscape has a handful
of command-line options that tell Inkscape to run in command-line mode,
thus suppressing the graphical interface. The one we used to print is the
-p option. This, combined with the lpr command, allowed us to print our
images without any user interaction. Listing 6 shows how we did the same
transform we did in Listing 5, except now in Python. The example
also shows how we called Inkscape to print our claim images.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb0bd0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 6. Same Transform as Shown in Listing 5, Except Using
Python</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
from Ft.Xml.Xslt import Processor
from Ft.Xml import InputSource
from Ft.Xml.Domlette import NonvalidatingReader

// load the claim data XML
// claim is the database result from Listing 4
doc = NonvalidatingReader.parseString(claim, "http://spam.com/doc.xml")

// load and process the XSLT
xsl = InputSource.DefaultFactory.fromUri("file://svg_xslt.xsl")
processor = Processor.Processor()
processor.appendStylesheet(xsl)

// do the transformation
result = processor.runNode(doc, "http://spam.com/doc.xml")

// write the SVG to a file
f = open("/tmp/"+ claim +".svg", "w")
f.write(result)
f.close()

// print the image on the default printer
os.system("inkscape /tmp/"+ claim  +".svg -p | lpr")
</pre></div><p>
Earlier, I mentioned we often have multiple pages per claim. When
printing, this was not an issue; we simply would send each page to the
printer as a separate job. When it came to archiving, we had to do
something different. As with the Web interface, we had to group the pages,
this time into a file, not a Web browser. When archiving, we had to store the
files in PDF format, because that is what our clients wanted. To get the
images into a PDF and combine the multiple page claims, we used Inkscape
and Ghostscript.
</p><p>
As with printing, Inkscape has an option to export a file into PostScript
format. Instead of using -p, we use -P and pass Inkscape the desired
output filename. After all of the pages of a claim have been written
to files, we use the following Ghostscript command to put the pages into
a single PDF and archive them:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gs -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -q -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=out.pdf
/tmp/foo1.ps
/tmp/foo2.ps
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb0e90"></a>
Maintaining the Forms</h2></div></div><p>
Shortly after we finished the project, we were faced with making two
rounds of changes to the layout of the form. The first round of changes
dealt with the positioning of text objects. The second round was
far more extensive&mdash;we had to draw a series of new boxes on the form to
accommodate a new identification system. Because we could not open the
modified SVG in Inkscape, we had to make our changes to the master SVG
and then apply them manually to the XSLT version.
</p><p>
At first, we thought making the changes would be hard and tedious, but
it turned out that the process was simple. For the first round, we simply
made the changes in the master using Inkscape, careful to keep a note of
the objects we changed. Then, using a text editor, we replaced the old
portions of XML with the new ones in the XSLT. Because the second batch
of changes was additions only, we decided simply to make another layer in
the master to which to add the boxes. When we finished adding the new
boxes,
we simply copied the new layer into the XSLT using a text editor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc0580.0xcb0ff0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
From start to finish, our project took a little more than a month to design,
build, test and publish. Our solution has made all of our applications more
agile and effective. We also have saved terabytes' worth of storage space
on our servers.
</p><p>
Currently, the SVG adaptation rate is rather slow. We are looking forward
to seeing what other tools will be built that utilize the versatile SVG
file format.
