The nitty-gritty details as to what OpenSSH is and why it is ubiquitous.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21bc580.0x22b4298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Is there a program more commonly used in day-to-day Linux computing than
SSH? I doubt it. Not only is it rock-solid, secure and versatile,
but it also is extremely simple to use and feature-rich. Because its algorithms
and protocols are both state of the art and their implementation is open for
peer review, we can rest assured on the cryptographic integrity of SSH.
SSH does have weaknesses, however; although most of them stem from
social engineering, and working around broken protocols, such as X11, pose a
big challenge.
</p><p>
SSH can do wonders in only a few lines of C code&mdash;thanks to the UNIX
philosophy of stringing together powerful tools in generic ways.
</p><p>
SSH acts as a secure channel, and it makes a remote system appear
local, and a local one
appear at the remote side. It can be used either for remote command
execution, with or without a pty, and it can be used for multiplexing
several TCP and X11 sessions. It also can be used for tunneling insecure
protocols, such as POP3 or SMTP, through secure SSH tunnels. In addition, it can be
used with some limitations to tunnel FTP securely.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21bc580.0x22b44a8"></a>
The OpenSSH Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
Let's begin with the overall scheme of things.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9566f1.large.jpg"><img src="9566f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. OpenSSH Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
As shown in Figure 1, OpenSSH is composed of three key
layers. The bottom layer, ssh-transport, is the most critical component
involved in all the crypto operations, such as key exchange, re-keying at
intervals, protecting against attacks in various ways and so on.
</p><p>
The layer on top of that, ssh-userauth, is responsible for authenticating
end users to the sshd d&aelig;mon that runs at the server end. Remember that
SSH authenticates both ways. The client SSH program authenticates the
sshd server d&aelig;mon using the ssh-transport protocol. After
authentication, key exchange is completed, and a secure connection is
established. Subsequent to that, user authentication takes place in the
ssh-userauth layer.
</p><p>
ssh-userauth provides a lot of flexibility, because users can authenticate to
the server in various ways&mdash;from a private key on a smart card to simple
user name/password authentication. Once it goes through, the
ssh-connection layer establishes a secure channel, either for executing a
remote command or to obtain an interactive login shell.
</p><p>
The ssh-connection layer is capable of multiplexing any number of
simultaneous independent secure sessions over a single
ssh-userauth layer with the transport stack layer below it, as shown in Figure
1. All of SSH's magic&mdash;forwarding
arbitrary TCP ports from local to remote and remote to local,
acting as a SOCKS proxy, forwarding X11 connections, establishing
VPN tunnels, executing remote commands with and without a pty&mdash;is done with the ssh-connection layer.
</p><p>
SSH has flow control built in to the protocol. Each secure
channel has a separate window size allocated. Because SSH operates above a
reliable TCP layer, this does not have much of a role. At least, it is
not as critical as the TCP windowing mechanism. Most of the critical
channel open/close messages and other termination messages don't consume
any window space.
</p><p>
Because all messages are encrypted and integrity-protected, nobody can
interpret the messages. There is a special SSH_MSG_IGNORE message type
that can be used for defeating traffic analysis attacks. These are the
kinds of attacks that figure out when data is going over the wire and how
much data is being transferred.
</p><p>
SSH, of course, comes with many other niceties for sending secure
KEEPALIVE messages, redirecting stdin to /dev/null for specialized X
window applications and many more.
</p><p>
Now, let's take a look at a sample SSH session and
typical message exchanges (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9566f2.large.jpg"><img src="9566f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. OpenSSH Protocol Flow Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
Here is a typical unencrypted SSH packet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
byte      SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
uint32    recipient channel
string    "pty-req"
boolean   want_reply
string    TERM environment variable value (e.g., vt100)
uint32    terminal width, characters (e.g., 80)
uint32    terminal height, rows (e.g., 24)
uint32    terminal width, pixels (e.g., 640)
uint32    terminal height, pixels (e.g., 480)
string    encoded terminal modes
</pre><p>
Most fields are self-explanatory. The top two fields are always present
in all messages. The payload packets (what the user types and the responses
from the server) are all carried with the SSH_MSG_DATA message type.
</p><p>
Every packet has a header that describes the contents of the
payload (message type) and the channel for which it is destined.
</p><p>
Some of the messages do not need a response from the other side, as the
underlying layer is not only reliable but also tamper-resistant. But,
most requests from the client have a corresponding response from the server.
</p><p>
Now, let's get to the gory details of the SSH key exchange protocol,
because
that is the most critical component that accounts for the security and
popularity of SSH.
</p><p>
Figure 3 shows the data manipulations that are necessary
to encrypt, compress and integrity-protect. Of course, we need to
protect ourselves against replay attacks as well. For that, there is an
implicit sequence number for each packet, and it starts at 0 and goes
to 2<sup  >32</sup> before wrapping around. Because the sequence number is hashed,
it can be sequential, and attackers never can guess what input will lead
to what hash.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9566f3.large.jpg"><img src="9566f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. OpenSSH Packet Processing
</p></div></div><p>
The key components of OpenSSH keys are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Hash: H.
</p></li><li><p>
Shared secret: K.
</p></li><li><p>
Session ID: session_id.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
SSH uses the above components to derive the following encryption vectors
and keys:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Client to server initialization vector.
</p></li><li><p>
Server to client initialization vector.
</p></li><li><p>
Client to server encryption key.
</p></li><li><p>
Server to client encryption key.
</p></li><li><p>
Client to server MAC key.
</p></li><li><p>
Server to client MAC key.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The equations used for deriving the above vectors and keys are taken from
RFC 4253. In the following, the || symbol stands for concatenation, K is
encoded as mpint, &ldquo;A&rdquo; as byte and session_id as raw data.
Any letter, such as the &ldquo;A&rdquo; (in quotation marks) means the
single character A, or ASCII 65.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Initial IV client to server: HASH(K || H || &ldquo;A&rdquo; || session_id).
</p></li><li><p>
Initial IV server to client: HASH(K || H || &ldquo;B&rdquo; || session_id).
</p></li><li><p>
Encryption key client to server: HASH(K || H || &ldquo;C&rdquo; || session_id).
</p></li><li><p>
Encryption key server to client: HASH(K || H || &ldquo;D&rdquo; || session_id).
</p></li><li><p>
Integrity key client to server: HASH(K || H || &ldquo;E&rdquo; || session_id).
</p></li><li><p>
Integrity key server to client: HASH(K || H || &ldquo;F&rdquo; || session_id).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Simple, right?
</p><p>
What is not simple, however, is figuring out the K and H parameters.
</p><p>
HASH is usually an SHA1 hash mechanism, but it can be something else as
well.
</p><p>
The typical cipher algorithm used is AES or DES3 in CBC mode. The MAC is
a combination of MD5 or the SHA1 hash algorithm with a secret key. There are four
choices here:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
hmac-sha1
</p></li><li><p>
hmac-md5
</p></li><li><p>
hmac-sha1-96
</p></li><li><p>
hmac-md5-96
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Actually, sha1 is a little weak in today's world, because collision attacks are
possible. The zeitgeist in hashing today is sha512, but with proper
re-keying and other smarts built in, it should not be a problem.
</p><p>
Remember that hashes are of a constant length, so hmac-sha1 is 20
bytes long, hmac-md5 is 16 bytes, and the other two have a fixed
length of 12 bytes each.
</p><p>
Okay, now for some mathematical and crypto gymnastics of the kex stage.
</p><p>
We know how to compute the individual encryption and MAC keys provided
that we derive the basic parameters using the simple equation above.
But, how do we get the parameters to begin with, in a secure,
authenticated manner?
</p><p>
Now, we need to look at how OpenSSH uses diffie-hellman-group14
and diffie-hellman-group1 fields to derive the DH generator and DH moduli
for an anonymous key agreement.
However, this leaves us open to several man-in-the-middle and other active
attacks. To thwart this, we use a known and trusted server public key to
authenticate key exchanges. Authentication of key exchange data is
nothing more than signing with a private key.
And, OpenSSH typically uses ssh-dsa or ssh-rsa keys for this purpose.
</p><p>
In other words, a combination of DH and RSA/DSS keys are used for
authentication and to derive the secret parameters K, H and session_id.
session_id is simply the hash of the first key exchange.
A 16-byte random cookie also is used to protect against replay and
other man-in-the-middle attacks.
</p><p>
Here is the equation for deriving H:
</p><p>
H = hash(V_C || V_S || I_C || I_S || K_S || e || f || K)
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
hash is usually the SHA1 hash algorithm.
</p></li><li><p>
V_C and V_S are the client and server identification strings.
</p></li><li><p>
I_C and I_S are the client and server SSH_MSG_KEXINIT messages just
exchanged.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now, we are left with computing e, f and K;
e and f are the DH parameters used for exponentiation:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
e = g<sup  >x</sup> modulo p
</p></li><li><p>
f = g<sup  >y</sup> modulo p
</p></li><li><p>
K = e<sup  >y</sup> modulo p
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Here, p is a prime number from the DH generator field. And, x and y are
chosen arbitrarily by client and server. Remember that DH works using
the simple mathematical principle that
a<sup  >b<sup>c</sup></sup> =
a<sup  >c<sup>b</sup></sup> =
a<sup  >bc</sup>.
</p><p>
Now, we have everything required for computing the secret keys.
</p><p>
The nice thing about all of these cryptographic
parameters is that they are thrown away after every session. The only reused parameter is
the server RSA/DSA key, but because we add a random cookie in our
calculations, it's difficult for attackers to break SSH
cryptographically.

Description of Each Component</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a look at the OpenSSH family before we proceed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9566f4.large.jpg"><img src="9566f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Stars in the OpenSSH Galaxy
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see in Figure 4, there are many executables and players in the grand
scheme of things. However, the interplay is not a complex one. Everything
I discussed above is actually implemented by SSH and sshd
components (client and server, respectively).
The other components are used rarely for key generation, agent forwarding and so
on.
</p><p>
sftp-server is the subsystem for SSH. This is an FTP-like protocol,
but it is highly secure and efficient, unlike the broken FTP protocol.
</p><p>
scp is a marvelously popular and convenient file transfer mechanism
built on top of the SSH infrastructure. Because integrity protection is
built in to the SSH wire protocol, file integrity is guaranteed.
However, it does not have a resume feature for broken transfers, so you
have to use it with rsync to get that facility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21bc580.0x26af3a8"></a>
Security Analysis and Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's look at the kind of attacks and threat models SSH
helps us guard against.
</p><p>
One of the most critical components of any cryptographic protocol is the
quality of the random number generator. Because computers are
deterministic devices, obtaining truly random data is a challenge.
Common sources of entropy include disk access, keyboard and mouse input,
process lifetimes and so forth. An incredibly large number of traditional UNIX
programs have relied on the gettimeofday(2) system call. SSH also uses sound
mechanisms to check the randomness of the pool of data.
</p><p>
One interesting attack specific to SSH is using control character
sequences to terminate sessions and interfere with pty interactions, so
we have to filter out suspicious character sequences.
</p><p>
The most critical and, unfortunately, the weakest point of SSH is server/host authentication. Reality and typical user negligence proves that we
just say yes whenever a new host key is added to our trusted list.
Efforts are underway to make this more secure and easier. If this is not
ensured, different types of man-in-the-middle attacks are possible.
