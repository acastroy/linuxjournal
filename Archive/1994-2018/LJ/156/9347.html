Use Python to demystify Open Document Format files.

The Open Document Format (ODF) Alliance is designed for sharing
information between different word processing applications. This article
highlights the basic structure of ODF files, some internals of
the underlying XML files and shows how to use Python to read the contents to
perform a simple search for keywords. The code also can be the basis for
more-advanced operations. In the spirit of openness, we use open-source
software to read the ODF files, which in this case are Python and the
OpenOffice.org package.
</p><p>
If you are running a recent version of Linux or OS X, you already
should have Python and OpenOffice.org installed on your machine. If you need the
latest versions, Python is available for free from <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">www.python.org</a> for both
the Windows and Linux platforms. The OpenOffice.org package also is available
for free from <a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_self">www.openoffice.org</a>. Installing
OpenOffice.org on
an XP desktop is relatively painless. Download the packages from their
respective
sites and run the installer. Once installed, simply run the application
from the desktop with a click on the installed icons.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1f580.0x1d174a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Tip:</b></p><p>
Most folks do have Microsoft Office installed.
If that's the case, the solution is to use a plugin for Microsoft Word
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter</a>). You can install both
the OpenOffice.org and Microsoft packages on the same machine without causing
any conflicts.
</p><p>
Please read the Bugs section on the SourceForge site for any incompatibilities
before you install the plugin. I used the OpenOffice.org suite to save
the files for this article, because it was easier.
</p></div><p>
Once you have confirmed that you have the prerequisites, you can create
an ODF file. Open up the Writer, type some text in a document and
save it. You can read in a file and save it as an .odt file.
</p><p>
A quick look at extensions in the Save dialog reveals a lot. An
ODF file can have many extensions, which provide a clue as to the
type of information stored in it and the application that stored it. See
Table 1.

So, what's in an ODF file? An ODF file is basically a zipped archive with
several XML files. The actual files and directories in a file will vary
depending on the type of information and the system on which the document
was created.
</p><p>
The first step in picking out the names of the files in an ODF file
requires unzipping the file itself. Fortunately, Python has built-in
support for dealing with this endeavor with the zipfile module. Type
<tt  >python</tt>
on the command line to run an interactive shell. Running a shell allows
you to examine the contents of objects returned from the modules. Because
you'll probably be doing this only once per type of data, there is
really no need to write and execute a script at this time. If you want
to preserve the work for future use, it's better to write a script
in a text editor or use the IDLE editor that comes with Python and save
the script. See Listing 1 on how to show the member functions
in a class or module.

&gt;&gt;&gt; import zipfile
&gt;&gt;&gt; myfile = zipfile.ZipFile
&#8618;('E:/articles/odf/theArticle.odt')
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(myfile)
['NameToInfo', '_GetContents', '_RealGetContents',

&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div><p>
The infolist() command from the Python documentation returns a list the
objects of a zipped archive. Run the dir() command on the first object
from this list to get more information stored for each zipped file
(Listing 2). This nice feature of looking at members in an object is
called introspection.
</p><p>
An iteration on the list of objects displays relevant information about
each file, such as when it was created, its extracted size, its compressed size
 and so on. It's better at this point to write a Python script and run it rather
than work at the command line of an interactive Python shell. This way,
you can preserve the script for later use. So, open up a text editor
and type in the script.

import sys, zipfile
myfile = zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1])
listoffiles = myfile.infolist()
for s in listoffiles:    print s.orig_filename
</pre></div><p>
The import statement allows you to use the sys module for getting a
command-line argument of the file, and the zipfile module loads in the
functionality for reading and unzipping files. As you saw from the
Python shell, the infolist() method on the zipfile archive lists the files
in it. So iterating over the items from the infolist() and then calling
an orig_filename member function gives you a list of all files in
the archive.
</p><p>
For more detailed information, try something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print s.orig_filename, s.date_time, s.filename,
 &#8618;s.file_size, s.compress_size

You will receive more information about the file, quite similar to this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mimetype (2006, 9, 9, 7, 50, 10) mimetype 39 39
Configurations2/statusbar/ (2006, 9, 9, 7, 50, 10)

Configurations2/floater/ (2006, 9, 9, 7, 50, 10)
Configurations2/floater/ 0 0
...SNIPPED FOR BREVITY...
</pre><p>
A typical ODF text file (with the .odt extension) will have some of the following
files when unzipped. Here's the output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mimetype
Configurations2/statusbar/
Configurations2/accelerator/current.xml
Configurations2/floater/
Configurations2/popupmenu/
Configurations2/progressbar/
Configurations2/menubar/
Configurations2/toolbar/
Configurations2/images/Bitmaps/
layout-cache
content.xml
styles.xml
meta.xml
Thumbnails/thumbnail.png
settings.xml
META-INF/manifest.xml
</pre><p>
The most important file in the archive is the content.xml file, because it
contains the data for the document itself. I discuss this file here;
however, for detailed information on each tag and so on, take a look at the
specification in the 2,000+-page PDF file from the OASIS Web site (see
Resources).
</p><p>
Basically, the content.xml file looks like a DHTML file with tags for all
the contents. The tag I was concerned with most for my search operation
was the &lt;text:p&gt; tag and its closing tag &lt;/text:p&gt;, which wraps paragraphs
in a document. I'll show you how to get this tag from a content file
later in this article.
</p><p>
Other files of interest in the archive are the META-INF/manifest.xml,
mimetype, meta.xml and styles.xml. Other files simply contain data
for configurations for the word processors reading and displaying the
contents file.
</p><p>
The manifest is simply an XML file with a listing of all the files in the
zipped archive. The mimetype file is a single line containing the mimetype
of the content file. The meta.xml contains information about the author,
creation date and so on. The styles file contains all the formatting styles
for displaying the file.
</p><p>
You can extract any of these files from the ODF file with the read()
method on the zip object to get it as a very long string. Once read, you
can modify, view and write the whole string to disk as an independent
file. Listing 3 shows how to extract the manifest.xml file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1f580.0x1d0fa70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

import sys, zipfile
if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
    print "Usage: extract odf-filename outputfilename
    sys.exit(0)

myfile = zipfile.ZipFile(sys.argv[1])
listoffiles = myfile.infolist()
for s in listoffiles:
    if s.orig_filename == 'META-INF/manifest.xml':
            fd = open(sys.argv[2],'w')
            bh = myfile.read(s.orig_filename)
            fd.write(bh)
            fd.close()

</pre></div><p>
For more than one file, you can use a list instead of the if clause:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if s.orig_filename in ['content.xml', 'styles.xml']:
</pre><p>
This way, you can extract whatever files you need to look at simply
by reading in their contents and either manipulating them or writing
them off to disk.
</p><p>
The contents of an XML file are best suited for manipulation as a tree
structure. Use the XML parsing capabilities in Python to get a tree of
all the nodes within an XML file. Once you have the tree in a content file,
you easily can get to the &lt;text:p&gt; nodes. You don't really have to extract
the file to disk, because you also can run an XML parser on the string just
as well as reading from a file.
</p><p>
There are two types of XML parsers, SAX and DOM. The SAX
parser is faster but less memory-intensive, because it reads and parses
an input file one tag at a time. You have only one tag at a time to
work with and must track data yourself. In contrast, the DOM parser reads
the entire file into memory and therefore provides better options for
navigating and manipulating the XML nodes.
</p><p>
Let's look at examples of using both SAX and DOM, so you can see which
one suits your purpose. The SAX example shows how to extract
unique node names from an XML file. The DOM example illustrates how
to read values from within specific nodes once the file has been read
completely into memory.
</p><p>
First, let's use the SAX parser to see what nodes are available in the
content.xml file. The code simply prints the name of each type node
found in the file. Note that for different types of files you may get
different node names (Listing 4).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c1f580.0x1d0fe90"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

import sys
from xml.sax import parse, ContentHandler

class tagHandler(ContentHandler):
    def __init__(self, tagName = None):
        self.tag = tagName
        self.uniq = {}

    def startElement(self,name,attr):
        if self.tag == None:
            self.uniq[name] = 1;
        elif self.tag == name:
            self.uniq[name] = name
        # ignore attributes for now

    def getNames(self):
        return self.uniq.keys()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    myTagHandler = tagHandler()
    parse(sys.argv[1], myTagHandler)
    myNames = [str(x) for x in myTagHandler.getNames()]
    myNames.sort()
    for x in myNames: print x
</pre></div><p>
A SAX program requires a class derived from ContentHandler and overriding
functions to handle the start, middle and end of each node. The tagHandler
class shown in Listing 4 is used primarily to track the start of each node
and ignores the contents. Use the names found in the listing as keys in
a dictionary. Then, use the keys() method to list the names into a list
that you also can sort(). I use this technique quite often to
get a sorting of unique members quickly, because the hashing functions in Python
dictionaries are very fast. Here's the output from the program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
office:automatic-styles
office:body
office:document-content
office:font-face-decls
office:forms
office:scripts
office:text
style:font-face
style:list-level-properties
style:paragraph-properties
style:style
style:text-properties
text:a
text:line-break
text:list
text:list-item
text:list-level-style-bullet
text:list-style
text:p
text:s
text:sequence-decl
text:sequence-decls
text:span
</pre><p>
I sorted the list of keys and printed only the types of tags found. You
will have many tags, and the order of the listed tags is not the way
they are found in the XML file. The tag you most likely will be
concerned with is &lt;text:p&gt;, which has the text in each paragraph. In
this example, I want to search for keywords in the text for one or more
paragraphs in a document.
</p><p>
Although I can use the SAX version of the program to search for the text,
I use the DOM libraries, because the code will be a little easier
to write (and subsequently, easier to maintain), and I promised
an example of this earlier.
</p><p>
The xml.dom and xml.dom.minidom packages in Python allow for reading
in XML files as DOM trees. Both packages come with a standard Python
installation. Use the minidom package as it has a smaller footprint
and is easier to use than the dom package. The minidom package is
sufficient for almost all my XML work, and I have never really needed the
heavyweight xml.dom package. See Resources for more information.
</p><p>
Use the minidom packages to read the elements of an XML file into a
tree-like structure. The nodes of the tree are objects based on the Node
class in Python. The output from Listing 4 provides the names
of nodes.
</p><p>
Up to this point, you have been using simple programs to list and extract data
from the archive. Now, the next example runs a search operation on
the file you've just read in. Look at the program in Listing 5.

        myodf.showManifest()        # Tell me what files

        myodf.findIt(phrase)        # find the phrase ...
</pre></div><p>
The program is designed to work as a class that reads and searches
for text in an ODF file. Declaring a class for the ODF reader helps in
organizing the code for searching text within a node. The showManifest()
member function simply tells me what files exist in the ODF file. In
this particular program, I collect all the text as a list of paragraphs,
and
then I search for the keywords passed in from the command line. If the
searched word matches, the paragraph is printed out.
</p><p>
The text found in each &lt;text:p&gt; is Unicode text. You
have to convert this to normal text in order to print correctly and/or
use in a widget. The encode() command translates the Unicode to a
printable string.
</p><p>
Unicode provides a unique number for every character, regardless of the
platform, program and language being used. The ability to work seamlessly
with the same text across multiple platforms is a great feature for
Unicode-enabled applications. Such features do come with a price
for some legacy operations. Each Unicode character can have flags as
bits set for special printing and so on, which causes a normal print statement
to interpret each character as a number instead of text. In Python,
the encode() member function of a Unicode string returns a printable
version of the string. Here is an example code snippet for that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
def findIt(self,name):
    for s in self.text_in_paras:
        if name in s:
            print s.encode('utf-8')
</pre><p>
The code in Listing 5 is not limited to an ODT file. You
can modify the code presented here to work with spreadsheet files with
an .ods file. Run the program in Listing 3 to get the contents.xml file
out, and then run the second program (shown in Listing 4) to list the types
of nodes. Below is a sample .ods file; note that
this file also has paragraphs in addition to the table tags:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
office:automatic-styles
office:body
office:document-content
office:font-face-decls
office:scripts
office:spreadsheet
style:font-face
style:style
style:table-column-properties
style:table-properties
style:table-row-properties
table:table
table:table-cell
table:table-column
table:table-row
text:p
</pre><p>
Use the program in Listing 5 to extract and search text from paragraphs as
before. A simple modification of changing the text:p to table:table-cell
searches for text within cells instead of paragraphs.
</p><p>
To summarize, an ODF file is a zipped archive of several XML files. One of
these files contains contents in known tags. Each type of ODF file can
have different tags based on stored information. By using introspection
and the XML parsing capabilities in Python, you can list the types of
nodes in a file and read them into a tree structure. Once read, you
can extract data only from those nodes in the tree that are of interest
to you.
