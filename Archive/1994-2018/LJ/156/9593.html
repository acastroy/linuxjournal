I'm writing this in the aftermath of the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show.
I attend CES every year, because it's always a treasure trove of
interesting Linux stories and use cases (a few of which appear in the UpFront
section of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> this month), and also because it's always fun to see what's happening
with a large old industry that's changing a lot more slowly than the annual
hype suggests.
</p><p>
Many consumer electronics &ldquo;revolutions&rdquo; aren't. Such will likely be case
this year with the arrival of Apple's new iPhone. I don't know if
scheduling MacWorld and CES for the same week happened by accident or
intent, but the effect was predictable: Steve Jobs' customarily
charismatic and news-packed opening keynote at MacWorld upstaged all of
CES&mdash;a tradeshow exceeded in size only by Europe's CeBIT.
</p><p>
The biggest news in Steve Jobs' speech was the iPhone. He called it
&ldquo;a
revolutionary product...that changes everything&rdquo;. He said it would
cause a revolution on the scale of the Macintosh in 1984 and the iPod in
2001. He even said the iPhone qualified as not one but &ldquo;three
revolutionary products&rdquo;. These were 1) &ldquo;a wide-screen iPod with touch
controls&rdquo;, 2) &ldquo;a revolutionary mobile phone&rdquo; and 3)
&ldquo;a breakthrough
Internet communications device&rdquo;. He contrasted it with
&ldquo;smartphones&rdquo;,
such as the Trio, Blackberry, Nokia E62 and Moto Q, all of
which feature keyboards that &ldquo;are there whether you want them or
not&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The iPhone is faced with a large, sharp color screen and a patented
pointing system called MultiTouch that lets you use multiple fingers to
do all kinds of stuff. (Except, of course, punching phone numbers
without looking at them, because all the numbers are displayed behind a
layer of clear tactile camouflage.) In the Apple tradition, controls are
minimal; there's a single button on the front and few others elsewhere.
</p><p>
At the top of techie conversation at CES was news that the phone would
run on Apple's BSD-based OS X and support &ldquo;desktop class&rdquo; applications.
That claim, and the one about iPhone being a &ldquo;revolutionary Internet
communications device&rdquo;, fueled hope that Apple would help break
the cell-phone industry out of the phone-maker/carrier silos that have trapped
customers inside and kept independent developers outside for the
duration. In a post on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Web site, I
wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Knock what's closed about the iPhone all you want; it's still a
computer with a mike, a screen, a speaker and a pile of other input
and output openings that invite developments of many kinds. That's
why I think iPhone is going make the cell-phone market a lot bigger.
It will encourage participation by developers and customers that
have until now been forced to cope with far less than they've wanted
from the cell-phone industry. And that includes all the legacy cell-phone players with which Apple now partners or competes.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I should have known better. In fact, I did, but ignored my inner cynic.
</p><p>
Back in 1997, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple after a long
hiatus, one of his first moves was to kill off clones of the company's
hardware. In the midst of the outcry that followed, I wrote this
to
Dave Winer, who published it on his own site (<a href="http://www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html" target="_self">www.scripting.com/davenet/stories/DocSearlsonSteveJobs.html</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
So Steve Jobs just shot the cloners in the head, indirectly doing
the same to the growing percentage of Mac users who preferred cloned
Mac systems to Apple's own. So his message to everybody was no
different than it was at Day One: all I want from the rest of you is
your money and your appreciation for my Art.
</p><p>
It was a nasty move, but bless his ass: Steve's Art has always been
first class, and priced accordingly. There was nothing ordinary
about it. The Mac &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; Steve talks about is one that rises
from that Art, not from market demand or other more obvious forces.
And that Art has no more to do with developers, customers and users
than Van Gogh's has to do with Sotheby's, Christie's and art collectors.
</p><p>
See, Steve is an elitist and an innovator, and damn good at both.
His greatest achievements are novel works of beauty and style. The
Apple I and II were Works of Woz; but Lisa, Macintosh, NeXT and
Pixar were all Works of Jobs. Regardless of their market impact
(which in the cases of Lisa and NeXT were disappointing), all four
were remarkable artistic achievements. They were also inventions
intended to mother necessity&mdash;and reasonably so. That's how all
radical innovations work. (Less forward marketers, including Bill
Gates, wait for necessity to mother invention, and the best of those
invent and implement beautifully, even though that beauty is rarely
appreciated.)
</p><p>
To Steve, clones are the drag of the ordinary on the innovative. All
that crap about cloners not sharing the cost of R&amp;D is just
rationalization. Steve puts enormous value on the engines of
innovation. Killing off the cloners just eliminates a drag on his
own R&amp;D, as well as a way to reposition Apple as something closer to
what he would have made the company if he had been in charge through
the intervening years.
</p><p>
The simple fact is that Apple always was Steve's company, even when
he wasn't there. The force that allowed Apple to survive more than a
decade of bad leadership, cluelessness and constant mistakes was the
legacy of Steve's original Art. That legacy was not just an OS that
was ten years ahead of the rest of the world, but a Cause that
induced a righteousness of purpose centered around a will to
innovate&mdash;to perpetuate the original artistic achievements. And in
Steve's absence, Apple did some righteous innovation too. Eventually,
though, the flywheels lost mass and the engine wore out.
</p><p>
In the end, by when too many of the innovative spirits first animated
by Steve had moved on to WebTV and Microsoft, all that remained was
that righteousness, and Apple looked and worked like what it was: a
church wracked by petty politics and a pointless yet deeply felt
spirituality.
</p><p>
Now Steve is back, and gradually renovating his old company. He'll
do it his way, and it will once again express his Art.
</p><p>
These things I can guarantee about whatever Apple makes from this
point forward:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
It will be original.
</p></li><li><p>
It will be innovative.
</p></li><li><p>
It will be exclusive.
</p></li><li><p>
It will be expensive.
</p></li><li><p>
Its aesthetics will be impeccable.
</p></li><li><p>
The influence of developers, even influential developers like
you, will be minimal. The influence of customers and users
will be held in even higher contempt.
</p></li><li><p>
The influence of fellow business artisans, such as Larry
Ellison (and even Larry's nemesis, Bill Gates), will be
significant, though secondary at best to Steve's own muse.
</p></li></ol></div></blockquote></div><p>
Ten years later, I can look back on that as one of the most prophetic
pieces I've ever written.
</p><p>
Steven Levy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Newsweek</em></span> (and the author of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hackers</em></span> and many other
books) reported this about his conversation with Jobs after the iPhone
announcement:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
But it's not like the walled garden has gone away. &ldquo;You don't want
your phone to be an open platform&rdquo;, meaning that anyone can write
applications for it and potentially gum up the provider's network,
says Jobs. &ldquo;You need it to work when you need it to work. Cingular
doesn't want to see its West Coast network go down because some
application messed up.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Hmm...I have a Trio here that's full of third-party apps that don't
bring down Verizon's network. Other Trios run third-party apps that
don't bring down Cingular's network either. Still, whether or not Jobs
is bogus on the subject of apps and networks, he clearly wants to keep
the iPhone closed from outside developers.
</p><p>
This makes sense. In spite of Apple's support for open source and open
standards (and its contributions are not trivial), the company
always has played closed games with customers and developers. The original
Macintosh was so closed to customers that opening it required a
long-shaft torx screwdriver and a special case spreader. And, developers
have rarely had much choice other than to work exclusively in Apple's
development environments.
</p><p>
Now, in the case of the iPhone, there won't be a development
environment. Apparently. I do know a number of people who think Apple is
just stalling at this point, because the phone isn't due out until June,
and it isn't in a position yet to produce an SDK. But, even if that's the
case, the facts on the face of this thing make one thing very clear:
Apple isn't going to bust any phone-maker/carrier silos. On the
contrary, it's going to build a new silo of its own with Cingular&mdash;the
carrier with which it signed an exclusive partnership deal. So, it's just
another jail with a prettier lock.
</p><p>
Now, what to do?
</p><p>
A hint came in the form of a story in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York
Times</em></span>, about how
passengers in Japan use cell phones to speed check-in at airports. The
airline ANA is using a system called skip in Japan and is working with
Star Alliance partners (which include United, Lufthansa and British
Airways) on extending the service, which does away with paper boarding
passes. What's interesting about this isn't the system, but the fact
that airlines use it for relating directly to customers, regardless of
phone-maker or cell system carrier. In other words, it's not about a
deal between ANA and Nokia/Verizon or Motorola/Sprint. It's a way for ANA
to relate directly with customers.
</p><p>
This hint encourages development of apps that disintermediate
phone-makers and pipe-controllers by putting customers and vendors into
direct contact, for the good of everybody involved.
</p><p>
Cell phones are much more personal than computers. In fact, they may be
the most personal technology ever created&mdash;as well as the most social.
Why should the market benefits of cell phones' personal and social
powers be restricted to phone-maker/carrier silo partners? In the long
run, they can't. There are simply too many benefits for too many
businesses&mdash;as well as customers&mdash;once these silos open up.
</p><p>
Can we get a sense of how many more market categories there can be,
and how much more business will grow around cell phones, once the silos
open up?
</p><p>
Yes&mdash;by looking at vertical market examples. A good one is the
university-student cell-phone market. Here, a company called Rave
Wireless (disclosure: I consult them) works with universities to replace
their once-lucrative but now-dead wireline phone business with their own
cell systems. The phones might be made by Nokia (or anybody) and the
carrier might be Cingular (or anybody), but the system is independent of
both. Instead, it exists for the purpose of serving relationships within
the university community&mdash;between teachers and students, students and
each other, students and local businesses, sports teams and fans. Rave
not only provides a raft of handy (even essential) applications for its
phone users, but it also provides a platform where students (or anybody using
Rave phones) can write their own applications.
</p><p>
Students can form &ldquo;entourages&rdquo; of groups around classes, fraternities,
dorm floors or whatever social collections they like. Teachers can text students
with schedule changes. Students can text local businesses to see, for
example, which pizza parlor can set a table for nine right after a game
is over. They can check bus schedules or use built-in GPS monitoring
when sending an emergency message to campus police. The list of
applications developed by both Rave and students is long and growing.
This is made possible not only by Rave's entrepreneurial smarts, but by
freedom from restrictions imposed by the customary phone-maker/carrier
silo agreements as well.
</p><p>
Rave can drive system-opening deals with both phone-makers and carriers,
because it comes to both with a large base of ready customers. It turns out
that phone-makers will make a custom phone if the order is big enough.
And, it also turns out
that carriers will open their systems for the same reason. Both still
make money&mdash;but not just with each other and their co-captive
customers. Instead, they open a whole new market ecosystem that gets
bigger for everybody.
</p><p>
I normally avoid writing about companies I consult, but the example Rave
Wireless provides is too important to overlook. And, I'm not hustling
them. Instead, I'm hustling something Rave's example encourages us to
think about: an open-phone marketplace, populated by rapidly evolving
and differentiating phone gear&mdash;with a proliferation of applications
to run on it and services to support it. In the long run, that's where
we're headed anyway. I'd like us to shorten the distance.
</p><p>
Where can we start? One place is with phones. I'm familiar with two open
Linux-based phone platforms: Trolltech's Greenphone and the OpenMoko
(profiled in the February 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>). There can be many
more, including gear from the familiar makers.
</p><p>
But, let's go beyond that. Let's find whole communities that already
relate and could relate much better with cell phones equipped with
community- and commerce-supporting applications. These could be
localities (towns, for example), professions (engineers, educators,
health-care or service workers) or organizations (professional or
lifestyle associations, unions, political parties). Or, hey, how about
Free Software and Open Source Development communities? Why not?
</p><p>
We not only have strength in numbers, we have the power to produce a
plethora of useful applications. (Try saying that fast.)
</p><p>
Again, it's going to happen anyway. Won't it be a lot more fun to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span>
it happen? And, isn't that what we're about?
