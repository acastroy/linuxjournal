Digium's Asterisk-Based Solutions</h2></div></div><p>
By the time you read this, Digium will have three new Asterisk-based
solutions for your telephony-based enjoyment. The first of these is
Digium's TDM800P, an eight-port analog telephony interface card with
Digium's
VoiceBus technology, which is built on a single PCI bracket for universal
PCI compatibility. Together with Digium's Asterisk software and a standard
PC or server, users can create an inexpensive and scalable telephony
solution comparable to a high-end PBX platform. The second item is
the TE120P, a single span, selectable T1 (24-channel), E1 (32-channel),
or J1 (24-channel) card that routes voice and data simultaneously,
eliminating the need for an external router. The TE120P also delivers
PBX and IVR services including voice mail, call conferencing, three-way
calling and VoIP gateways. Last but not least is the software-based,
G.168-compliant High Performance Echo Canceller (HPEC) for 32-bit
and 64-bit Linux platforms. The HPEC provides echo cancellation for
configurable tail lengths of 16ms (128 taps), 32ms (256 taps), 64ms

John Brosnan and Kyle Copeland's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning TiVo
Programming</em></span> (Wrox Press)</h2></div></div><p>
To the delight of hackers far and near, TiVo made it possible to create
applications for its popular digital video recorder (DVR) product.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning TiVo Programming</em></span> by John Brosnan and Kyle
Copeland is targeted at programmers who want to gain a &ldquo;complete
understanding of all the pieces that make up a TiVo application&rdquo;.
The book uses real-life code examples to guide the reader through
the steps needed to implement an application. The team of Brosnan and
Copeland designed its own application for HME, which is the code name for
TiVo's powerful new open platform for applications. The latest SDK for
HME can be found at
<a href="http://tivohme.sourceforge.net" target="_self">tivohme.sourceforge.net</a>.

3Com's Open Services Networking Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Doc Searls' and the Linux Community's call for open architectures all
over is gaining nice momentum. A case in point is 3Com's Open Services
Networking (OSN) Platform, the firm's strategy to base its network
solutions on an open, interoperable, multivendor architecture. The idea
is to &ldquo;let organizations, rather than their networking vendors, select
the applications that best match business requirements and implement
them with timeliness and efficiency&rdquo;, say the 3Com-ers. Lucky for us,
a key component of OSN is the Open Source Service Monitoring bundle,
which leverages a number of pretested and supported open-source-based
network and service management applications, such as MRTG, NTOP, TShark
and Nagios. The open-source bundle is currently available for download
from 3Com's Web site.

Fluendo's Media Codecs for Open Source Systems</h2></div></div><p>
The mellifluously named firm Fluendo of Spain recently released
proprietary codecs for Windows Media Player (audio, video, MMS streaming
protocol), MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 for the Linux and Solaris desktop and server
platforms. Fluendo says that &ldquo;agreements with Microsoft and MPEG
LA&rdquo; take
the solution out of the legal limbo in which other codecs are entangled.
Fluendo's codecs are closely integrated with the GStreamer multimedia
framework, supporting applications such as Totem, Elisa, Jokosher,
Rhythmbox and Banshee. Fluendo will release further codecs during 2007;
existing codecs are available for purchase from Fluendo's Web site.

Levanta's Intrepid X Linux Management Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
The Levanta folks recently launched a new Linux management appliance,
called Intrepid X. Targeted at &ldquo;large Linux departments and data centers
with high scalability and mission criticality requirements&rdquo;, Intrepid X
offers &ldquo;on-demand functionality, disaster recovery, system portability,
complete change control, unattended active/passive fail-over and
interoperability with iSCSI or Fibre-Channel SANs for RPM-based Linux
environments&rdquo;. Levanta says that customers who already preside over
virtual storage and want to leverage their SANs to get the increased
speed, portability, manageability and disaster recovery advantages found
in Linux will benefit. The Intrepid X can be paired with different
types of SAN storage, including products from EMC, HDS, IBM and others.
In addition, one can manage Linux running in VMware virtual machines,
as well as both physical and virtual environments from one interface.

The KDevelopment Team's KDevelop</h2></div></div><p>
The ambitious KDevelopment Team has released version 3.4 of KDevelop,
a powerful, language-independent, user-friendly integrated development
environment&mdash;that's not just for programming KDE apps. Version 3.4
is the first new release in more than a year, closing more than 500 bugs and
adding several new features. New features include improved Qt 4 support,
new debugging capabilities, an enhanced default user interface layout,
improvements for C++, and Ruby and PHP support. Official KDevelop
packages are available for Kubuntu and OpenSUSE; unofficial builds
also are available for other distros. One of our fellow Linux media
outlets recently called KDevelop one of the top &ldquo;killer apps&rdquo; on the
Linux platform.

Although many Web hosting companies let you choose whether to host your Web
site on Linux or Windows, Netfirms says it's the first to unite the two
platforms under the umbrella of a single account. With its Business
and Enterprise lines of hosting accounts, Netfirms has Windows-based
applications executed natively on a Windows Server 2003 grid and
Linux-based applications natively on a Linux server grid. &ldquo;The two
platforms are unified through proprietary clustered technology&rdquo;, says
Netfirms, &ldquo;allowing customers to manage both transparently through a
single account&rdquo;. The Netfirms multiplatform server technology offers
Windows-based functionality via the Microsoft Hosting Partner Program,
including ASP.NET, Classic ASP and Microsoft SQL Server. On the Linux
side, the full LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) is available.
The two lines encompass a wide range of hosting options depending on
the client's needs.
