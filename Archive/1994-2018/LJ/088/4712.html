    Using freeVSD enables self-sufficient systems and can save software
    headaches.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x21b73a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I work in an environment where software
developers and system administrators with varying capabilities
aggressively and routinely use Linux. We frequently explore new
applications but sometimes hesitate to actually initiate an
installation because we lack confidence in the software. Our
concern is that rogue software might disrupt essential services on
production servers. In extreme cases, it is even possible that a
poorly written installer might corrupt a workstation's operating
system installation.
</p><p>Typically, implementing even a slightly complicated
application that interacts with the web server requires installing
the application, adding a new user (for suid operation), adding
lines to httpd.conf, restarting the web server and creating and
manipulating files in root-owned places like /etc or /usr/local/.
All of this has to be undone if we later decide not to put the
system into production use. While uninstall scripts can assist in
this, these scripts could fail, leaving the system in an
indeterminate state.</p><p>freeVSD is a GPL product initially conceived to enable an ISP
to provide virtual server hosting. It can also transform a stock
Red Hat installation into a powerful, low-cost testing environment.
freeVSD works by simulating up to 250 full-featured private
servers. Hard links to system files facilitate compact and
homogeneous environments for each virtual server. Logins to the
virtual servers are restricted via the native
<span   class="bold"><b>chroot</b></span> facility, effectively
creating a secure sandbox.</p><p>Now, we can experiment recklessly, hand the keys over to
inexperienced juniors or casually grant root privileges to
strangers, with little concern for negative consequences.</p><p>From the system administrator's standpoint, freeVSD enables
you to create multiple self-sufficient systems, each with its own
administrative account and the ability to manage user accounts, as
well as the ability to configure their own web services, mail
services, database server&mdash;a &ldquo;Lite&rdquo; version of Linux, if you
will.</p><p>freeVSD was originally developed for an ISP in the United
Kingdom and has been under development for three years. Based on
mailing list archives, freeVSD seems popular and well supported.
Questions are answered quickly, either by users or the
developers.</p><p>Many significant functions of each virtual server can be
administered by a rootlike account named Admin. For example, the
Admin account can add users, manipulate their privileges, make
changes to httpd.conf, restart various aspects of the server and so
on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x21b7710"></a>Installing freeVSD</h2></div></div><p>Installing freeVSD can be a bit tricky. You need to be
especially careful if you intend to restore the hostsystem back to
its original configuration. As always, it is imperative to back up
anything you are not comfortable with catastrophically losing.
According to the web site, support for Debian, Mandrake and
Slackware is forthcoming, but so far only Red Hat 6.x and 7.x. are
officially supported. Version 1.4.6 introduces support for Red Hat
7.0, but Red Hat 6.2 seems to have more of the kinks worked
out.</p><p>It is recommended that freeVSD be installed on a nearly
pristine system. Start with a freshly installed Red Hat 6.2. Then
decide whether you want any special server software available, such
as MySQL, Postgres or PHP. Apply patches. Ideally, all applications
should be installed before configuring freeVSD. Note that freeVSD
works quite well under VMware, which might prevent a bit of stress
during the first few installs. You'll probably need around 800MB of
free disk space to accommodate the filesystem skeleton.</p><p>I assume you have or can obtain a FQDN or dedicated IP number
for your first virtual host (freeVSD uses IP aliases). Of course,
you need to be sure to obtain permission from whomever is in charge
of your network before engaging in behavior that might be
considered aggressive.</p><p>Then choose a name for your first virtual host. A good idea
might be the hostname, (e.g., &ldquo;myhost&rdquo; if your FQDN is
myhost.mydomain.com) or the domain name (mydomain), if you are
providing hosting for multiple domains.</p><p>Here's an overview of the freeVSD install process, described
in detail by the file /usr/doc/freevsd-x.y.z/user-guide.txt.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Install main RPM (e.g.,
freevsd-1.4.6-2.i386.rpm).</p></li><li><p>Install pkgs RPM (e.g.,
freevsd-pkgs-1.4.6-1.i386.rpm).</p></li><li><p>Run
<b  >/usr/sbin/vsd-install.pl</b>.</p></li><li><p>Run <b  >/usr/sbin/vsd-genskel.pl</b>
(several hundred megabytes will be copied during this process, so
be patient). It is simple to customize this installation process.
The file /etc/freevsd.conf provides several customization
opportunities to specify files to include and exclude during
skeleton generation. Red Hat 7.x users may need to tweak
/etc/xinetd.conf and/or restart xinetd at this point.</p></li><li><p>Create first virtual host with a command such as
<b  >/usr/sbin/vsdadm vs_create localhost
<i><tt>name-of-virtual-server IP-of-Virtual-Server
FQDN-of-virtual-server</tt></i> 200 0</b>.</p></li><li><p>Execute batch by running
<b  >/usr/sbin/vsd-vsbatch.pl</b>.</p></li><li><p>Start the virtual server(s) with <b  >vsboot
--start</b>.</p></li><li><p>Try out the virtual shell with
<b  >/usr/bin/bevs -r [<i><tt>name of
virtual</tt></i>]</b> (become the virtual shell).</p></li><li><p>Set the administrative password with
<b  >passwd -u admin</b>.</p></li><li><p>Exit the virtual shell by typing
<b  >exit</b>.</p></li></ol></div><p>At this point, assuming nothing went wrong, you will have a
functioning virtual server to which you may connect via Telnet or
FTP.
</p><p>To uninstall, stop all virtual servers with
<b  >/usr/sbin/vsboot --stop</b>. Next, optionally delete
existing virtual hosts with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/vsdadm vs_delete localhost myhost
</pre><p>Then, run <b  >/usr/sbin/vsd-uninstall.pl</b> to
restore configurations and optionally delete files. Take care to
answer these questions correctly the first time as you won't get a
second chance, and you will have to restore configurations
manually. Finally, remove the pkgs and main RPMs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x21b8630"></a>Under the Hood</h2></div></div><p>The /usr/sbin/vsd-genskel.pl installation script copies
system files from the host into a directory referred to as the
skeleton. This process is controlled by entries in
/etc/freevsd.conf, which specifies files to include and delete. The
copies are placed in /home/vsd/skel/ by default:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /home/vsd/skel
bin  dev etc  home  lib  proc sbin  tmp  usr
</pre><p>The root filesystem of each virtual server relies on hard
links to corresponding binaries in this skeleton. A hard link is an
additional directory entry pointing to a particular file. Note that
hard links differ from symbolic links in that every hard link must
be deleted before the file is removed from the system; if the file
that a symbolic link points to is removed, the symlinked file
becomes unresolvable. Since each server shares the same copies of
files that comprise most of the default filesystem, relying on hard
links creates a tremendous savings of disk usage.
</p><p>As far as ps and top are concerned, the freeVSD user
processes seem to run as root; however, they don't start with root
privileges. By default, UIDS start at 1,000 and increment by 200
for each subsequent virtual machine (i.e., the first vm starts at
1,000, the next at 1,200, etc.). This behavior can be modified by
changes to the configuration file, /etc/vsd.conf.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the host machine assumes multiple IP
addresses using IP aliasing. A d&aelig;mon, /usr/sbin/virtuald,
works with <span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> (or
<span   class="bold"><b>xinetd</b></span>, which replaces inetd in
Red Hat 7.0) to intercept client connections to services such as
Telnet or FTP. The incoming connection is handed to the appropriate
d&aelig;mon in the virtual environment by using chroot to the
host's filesystem, by default a directory located in
/home/vsd/vs/.</p><p>Because of potential security exploits, the virtual web
server does not run directly on port 80. Instead, a host server
process called <span   class="bold"><b>vsredirect</b></span> forwards
traffic from port 80 to port 8080 and moves https traffic on port
443 to port 8443. The file documentation file security.txt details
how a malicious user could gain root access without this safeguard
in place. Redirection is recommended for all privileged ports below
1000.</p><p>Within the freeVSD filesystem, several common commands such
as <span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span> have been modified slightly
so that the Admin account has the additional privileges required to
administer accounts on the virtual server. This includes the
ability to establish user accounts and manage their files.</p><p>Separate d&aelig;mon processes (httpd, pro-ftpd, sendmail and
so on) are created for each virtual host. A suid script allows the
Admin of the virtual host to start and stop the d&aelig;mons via
the /usr/sbin/rebootvs command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x21b8bb0"></a>The Admin Experience</h2></div></div><p>The Admin account has simulated root privileges, enabling the
Admin user to perform various administrative tasks without
seriously compromising the host. The Admin is not a diluted root
account; rather, it is an enhanced user account with the limited
ability to manage files and accounts on a particular virtual
server.</p><p>Upon logging in, whoami reports admin and your home directory
is /root. Examination of the root (/) directory reveals that Admin
owns /root, /home and /tmp. Other Admin-owned files can be
determined by running</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name admin -print
</pre><p>You are really running Linux, and it really is the bash
shell. It's not a watered-down experience. You can run Python or
Perl or even compile new apps with
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>. You are in a standard Linux
shell environment, and it appears to be your own system.
</p><p>In /home/httpd/docs one can find the DocumentRoot for the
default web server, and /home/web/log contains the log files. The
httpd.conf file is located in /etc/httpd/conf/ and may be modified
by Admin. As mentioned earlier, /usr/sbin/rebootvs will effectively
restart the virtual server by restarting its processes.</p><p>Examining /etc/passwd shows the regular system accounts and
the admin account; note that this file is read-only. However,
<b  >/usr/sbin/useradd
&lt;<i><tt>newuser</tt></i>&gt;</b> works as
expected, including the addition of the new user to the /etc/passwd
file.</p><p>The file /etc/vsd/priv has a format similar to /etc/groups.
It controls which users have privileges such as login, Telnet and
FTP access, as well as whether they are allowed to run Perl or gcc.
The /usr/bin/listrights command will show the rights granted to a
named user. The /usr/sbin/setrights command is a utility to manage
this file; however, from a review of the source code (setrights.c),
it doesn't appear that the login privilege may be granted with this
utility. It is possible to edit /etc/vsd/priv manually and grant
this privilege; since Admin doesn't have write privileges in /etc/,
the login privilege can only be granted by root.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x25b1220"></a>Administering freeVSD from the Host</h2></div></div><p>The freeVSD d&aelig;mon follows the Sysvinit startup
conventions and can be controlled via:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/vsd start
/etc/rc.d/init.d/vsd stop
/etc/rc.d/init.d/vsd restart
/etc/rc.d/init.d/vsd status
</pre><p>(though this may not yield accurate results).
</p><p>Several options are configurable through the file
/etc/vsd.conf. You may also start or restart a given virtual server
with the /usr/sbin/vsboot command.</p><p>The /usr/sbin/vsdadm command, introduced during the
installation process, can be used to create and delete virtual
machines and to manage user accounts. It works by issuing commands
to the vsd d&aelig;mon that runs on port 1725. This approach
enables alternative front ends to manage freeVSD. This includes the
administration suite, which consist of tools developed by Idaya,
Ltd., some of which run in a web browser or under Microsoft
Windows.</p><p>The program /usr/bin/bevs (become a virtual server) allows a
user on the host to quickly assume the role of root on the virtual
machine, without Telneting or otherwise connecting to the virtual
machine. Most notably useful is the ability to set the Admin
password initially or manage files not owned by Admin or a virtual
user.</p><p>The following scripts, while useful during install, may
become liabilities afterward. You may wish to issue the command
<b  >chmod a-x</b> on them to avoid inadvertently
executing them again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/vsd-genskel.pl
/usr/sbin/vsd-install.pl
</pre><p>The program
/usr/sbin/<span   class="bold"><b>vsd-refreshskel.pl</b></span> will
update the freeVSD skeleton and then relink files in the root
filesystems on each virtual machine. This enables you to add,
remove or update applications available to the virtual servers. Be
sure to read the documentation or scan the source code before
trying this command. Packages you wish to make available to the
virtuals, but not to the host, may be installed with the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh --force --root=/home/vsd/skel/ file.rpm
</pre>


Similarly, you may use
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh --force --root=/home/vsd/vs/some-vs file.rpm
</pre>


to install an RPM into a single virtual server. Unfortunately,
since the bulk of the skeleton is created by copying files and not
from RPM installations, the RPM database will not accurately
reflect the installed packages, so the force option is necessary.
</p><p>Since /usr/sbin/vsd-refreshskel.pl will refresh the skeleton,
it's useful to propagate upgrades to system software on every
virtual machine. Please note that this utility seems to be broken
for Red Hat 7.x in freeVSD version 1.4.6.</p><p>The /usr/share/doc/freevsd-1.4.6/ directory contains
documentation and is made available to each virtual machine by
default. Finally, /usr/share/freevsd/ contains scripts useful for
site customization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x25b17f8"></a>Informal Security Analysis and
Discussion</h2></div></div><p>Giving superuser capabilities to regular users is serious
business. We frequently see root exploits via shell accounts, so
one must wonder if these problems could be compounded in the chroot
environment provided by freeVSD.</p><p>On the other hand, one operating system patch can instantly
improve security for up to 250 web site administrators. Further,
having dedicated httpd processes prevents many of the problems
usually present in a typical shell environment, where one user's
actions could inadvertently disrupt another user's service.</p><p>An ordinary user on the host can see the processes of every
user on every virtual machine. Further, using the bevs -r command,
they can become root on any of the virtual servers by default! The
bevs command is suid root, so apparently this is intentional. I
recommend changing the permissions in order to disable this (e.g.,
<b  >chmod o-xr /usr/bin/bevs</b> will do the trick),
while still enabling members of the root group to run bevs.</p><p>The virtual server administrative d&aelig;mon /usr/sbin/vsd
listens on port 1725. Out of the box, it is a trivial task to query
a virtual server for user lists, change user privileges&mdash;in effect,
fully control the vsd d&aelig;mon remotely, with no authentication.
As suggested in the file security.txt, it is imperative that you
control this with commands on the host, such as these (which should
be placed in rc.local):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipchains -A input -p tcp -s W.X.Y.Z
&lt;@cont_arrow&gt;&aring;&lt;@$P&gt;--dport 1725 -j ACCEPT
ipchains -A input -p tcp -s 0/0 --dport 1725 -j REJECT
</pre><p>Because of the complexity of propagating operating system
updates to the virtual machines, it is prudent to run a stable
distribution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x25b1b10"></a>Alternatives: Application Testing without
freeVSD</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps the simplest way to test out a new application is to
keep a spare machine around on which you can safely format the
drive and re-install it. While reinstallation can be a good
experience builder, continually installing and tweaking becomes a
nuisance.</p><p>Another option is to create disk images. After you have
freshly installed the operating system and have it configured to
your satisfaction, a command such as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/tmp/image
</pre><p>can create an image file that can be used to restore the
operating system at a later date. Beware of the 2GB file size
limitation if using this strategy&mdash;the
<span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span> utility will be helpful.
</p><p>The commercial application, VMware, fully simulates an x86
PC, right down to a full-featured Phoenix BIOS. For maximum
performance, VMware directly utilizes the host processor to execute
most instructions, instead of emulating the CPU. The VMware
approach is not particularly efficient from a disk utilization
standpoint: each session must have the operating system completely
installed. VMware can create virtual disks from files, so multiple
drives are not necessary. In addition to being disk-intensive,
memory must be dedicated to each running virtual. However, with
VMware, you are not limited to a single Linux distribution or even
to the Linux operating system. It offers a more complete virtual
server environment but is more resource-intensive, including the
need to administer and update each operating system separately.
Note that Plex86
(<a href="http://www.plex86.org" target="_self">http://www.plex86.org/</a>)
is a free alternative to VMware under development.</p><p>User Mode Linux offers yet another means. In short, the Linux
kernel has been ported to another architecture&mdash;a process running
inside a regular Linux kernel. Full details are available at
<a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20bf580.0x25b1ed8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>freeVSD is a promising product. The technique of running
multiple server processes for each virtual server results in a
robust and reasonably efficient solution. The illusion that the
virtual server is a dedicated machine is fairly convincing, but the
lack of full control over the virtual's filesystem can be
occasionally frustrating. Plus the Admin user's inability to
install RPMs is somewhat limiting. But for moderate development,
especially where the primary tools you need are already installed
and compatible with freeVSD, this is one of the quickest ways to
create a fresh Linux system. The chances of inadvertently goofing
up the host from a virtual server are negligible.</p></div></div>
