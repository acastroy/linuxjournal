Released on-line on April 19, 2001, Mandrake 8.0 adds kernel 2.4.3,
XFree86 4.0.3, KDE 2.1.1, GCC 2.96 and miscellaneous other upgrades
to 7.2 (the previous release). Mandrake is advertised primarily as
a workstation and desktop-oriented distribution, so I will be
evaluating it with these applications in mind. Supremely important
in a desktop distribution are ease of setup, ease of configuration,
ease of operation, quality of the software bundle and ease of
installing new software; I will focus primarily on these criteria.
My test machine for this review is a PIII 560 with 384MB of RAM, a
6GB hard disk and a Matrox G400.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb40580.0xc38b88"></a>Setup and First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>Mandrake 8.0 comes on two (download edition) or four (retail
version) CD-ROMs; the first two of which will be necessary for most
installations. As with nearly all modern distributions, loading the
first CD and rebooting is all that is necessary to start the
installation. Mandrake 8.0's graphical installer closely resembles
the installer used in the 7.x releases and is really about as
user-friendly as an OS installer should be. Once the installer
loads, it prompts the user for information such as how the computer
will be used and what broad categories of packages to install. Many
of the decisions that users new to computers or new to Linux (e.g.,
converting from Windows, more about this below) won't necessarily
know how to answer, such as sizing and placement of partitions, are
handled by the installer's defaults. As with the 7.x releases, you
can go back to any previous part of the install by clicking on the
button next to the appropriate step on the left side of the screen.
Even X configuration&mdash;the area where I most often run into
trouble&mdash;went without a hitch. This appears to be at least in part
due to the move to XFree86 4.0.3, a significant improvement despite
lacking solid support for certain graphics chipsets (notably
several by Chips and Technologies common in older notebooks). One
option to pay special attention to is the option to log on a user
at boot automatically. Once you have answered all of the
configuration questions, the installer will install and configure
the requested packages, meanwhile displaying annoying &ldquo;hints&rdquo;
&agrave; la the Windows 98 installer. The install took a little
less than 15 minutes from the first reboot (to start from the
installation CD) to a KDE user desktop.</p><p>If you get the retail version of Mandrake 8.0 (this is
discussed later), the startup process is completely graphical. The
boot-loader menu is a text list with an abstract design in the
background, and the Linux startup process with its status icons
resembles a Mac OS boot more than anything else. While most
<i  >Linux Journal</i> readers likely will disable this
feature in favor of actually seeing what's going on during the boot
process, I can see it being highly beneficial to users who wouldn't
know UNIX from eunuchs and think bash is a verb. When the desktop
finally loads (startup could take a minute or two on slower
hardware) the user is presented with a very Windows-esque
interface. Good or bad, that's what it is (see the next section).
At first examination this represents a fairly well set up desktop,
with icons for documentation, connection to the Internet, etc.,
right on the desktop and the most useful applications and utilities
already in the KDE menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb40580.0xc38d40"></a>Desktop Usability</h2></div></div><p>Mandrake 8.0 is definitely a step forward in terms of desktop
usability. Between the KDE 2 desktop and the pre-installed
productivity applications, MandrakeSoft has managed to put together
a very usable desktop environment suitable for many users' needs.
The default install by no means caters to the advanced user or the
server market; unlike the 7.x series of releases, Mandrake 8.0
doesn't include any alternative window managers nor does it install
(by default) many popular services such as SSH and NFS. This is
clearly a very desktop-oriented distro. While Mandrake doesn't
really add much to the functionality of user applications&mdash;KDE 2
and bundled applications take care of most of that&mdash;it does bring a
marked improvement to system configuration. The graphical
configuration utilities included (Mandrake Control Center, User
Manager, etc.) are a distinct improvement over the utilities
included with most other distros including previous releases of
Mandrake. Where users once had to guess at cryptic names not
obvious without documentation, now there are obvious names and
easy-to-operate utilities like Mandrake Control Center to ease the
process. This is definitely a step forward.</p><p>That said, there are still significant problems. First and
foremost for desktop users is the presence of GNOME and other
non-KDE applications in a (by default) KDE environment. While this
isn't a problem on its own, the fact that the GTK toolkit produces
a significantly different look and a new set of widgets makes for a
less consistent interface. For new users this shouldn't present
much of a problem (you can just train them on both) nor should it
present much of a problem for many Windows users (many Windows
applications have bizarre nonstandard interfaces), but it may be an
issue if you are a migrating Mac OS user who is used to software
written by highly interface-conscious developers sporting carefully
designed interfaces and consistent UI elements throughout. This too
can be worked through, nonetheless it is something to be planned
for if migrating users from one of these platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb40580.0xc38ea0"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>Subjective performance is very good. I attribute this largely
to the move from the XFree86 3.x series of releases to 4.0.3. The
move to KDE 2.1.1 may also contribute&mdash;most of the review is
conducted under KDE except where noted. Performance on SMP systems
should also be markedly improved due to improved SMP support in
kernel 2.4. One issue that anyone intending to install Mandrake 8.0
should be aware of is that the default configuration (XFree86 4 and
KDE 2) needs quite a bit of RAM. I would strongly recommend 128 or
256MB of RAM. I would also recommend installing a graphics card
with good 2-D acceleration under Linux, such as a Matrox G200 or
ATI RAGE PRO (note: these are two inexpensive cards I have
personally found to work well, but there are many others out
there), as this will improve the subjective performance of X
applications greatly. Between the video card and RAM you should be
able to get Mandrake running acceptably without much
trouble.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb40580.0xc38fa8"></a>Other Notes</h2></div></div><p>Mandrake 8.0 has a few technology updates and niceties that
made my life significantly easier. One is fairly good support for
USB. While it still doesn't allow transparent hot-plugging of USB
devices, Kudzu did detect my USB mouse at boot without problems,
and even the scroll wheel&mdash;extremely useful to those of us who are
on the Web a lot&mdash;worked without any user configuration. While
hot-plugging still isn't supported (as noted above) and USB and
PS/2 mice sporadically cannot operate simultaneously, support is
good enough for a desktop system. I looked specifically at support
for the 2.4 series of kernels, especially with respect to issues
with building and installing modules. I had no issues save one
involving the menu entry for the correct USB controller not
appearing in menuconfig, and I believe that this is fixed in kernel
2.4.5. Overall, the move to 2.4 appears to be a good thing.</p><p>I also appreciated the inclusion of Galeon&mdash;one of the better
browsers available for Linux&mdash;along with the usual Konqueror,
Netscape Communicator and Mozilla. Overall Mandrake is becoming a
complete system suitable for everyday desktop use.</p><p>There are, however, a few gotchas associated with the version
upgrades. Be sure that your graphics card is well supported under
XFree86 4 because this is potentially the cause of all manner of
apparent application instability and general glitching. At one
point I had problems getting my graphics card to switch to 1024
&times; 768, but manually editing my X config took care of this. I
expect the X configuration issue to be fixed in an update to
Mandrake Control Center. Another thing to be aware of is that the
downloadable version of Mandrake 8.0 is not exactly the same as the
retail version. There is the obvious difference that the download
edition comes with two CDs rather than the four that the retail
version includes (it omits the commercial packages), but I noticed
that the download version did not have the graphical overlay to the
kernel boot process enabled. While I didn't notice any other
concerns, it is possible that there are more hidden differences
lurking in the details of some package's configuration. Overall,
though, I found no problems that make Mandrake 8.0 any less usable
than the previous release.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb40580.0xc39160"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Mandrake 8.0 is certainly worth consideration for workstation
and desktop use, especially when deploying to users who are not
already trained in using Linux systems. It may be a highly useful
tool for migrating users to Linux from other popular platforms;
version 8.0 appears geared toward minimizing retraining costs for
migrating users. The real downside to Mandrake 8.0 is its resource
usage; if you are already running a number of Linux workstations on
low-end hardware&mdash;perhaps 233MHz machines with 64MB of RAM, a
likely configuration for an older network&mdash;you will probably need
hardware upgrades to get reasonable performance out of your
machine. To put it shortly, Mandrake 8.0 is best as a desktop
environment and is definitely a top candidate when a user-friendly
interface is high on your list of priorities.</p><p><a href="4801s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
