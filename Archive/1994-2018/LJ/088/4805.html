have to say that I love it. I have friends that say that there
isn't enough flash to it (maybe a little glitter would help), but I
say that there really isn't anything that I would change. I love
the inventor/hacker spirit. There is this feeling that there is
always something cool to do with Linux that no one else tried on a
Mac or Wintel machine. I mean from using wireless communication in
Africa to running your can opener in your house from a workstation
in Borneo. Okay, maybe not the latter, but I am waiting for it or
the in-dash Linux MP3 player. Now that is some rockin' good stuff.
I say keep up the good work.</p><p>&mdash;Matthew James</p><p>See Don Marti's interview with Hugo Fiennes and
Marc Merlin in the July/August 2001 issue of our sister
publication <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i> for information on
the Rio Car, an in-dash Linux MP3 player.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9d348"></a>Crash Free</h2></div></div><p>A few years ago, you sent out Linux bumper stickers to some
of us subscribers, for some reason, I forget why. I thought you'd
like to know that my car hasn't crashed since I put Linux on
it.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Blackwell</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9d4a8"></a>Agree with Review (Mandrake 7.2 March
2001)</h2></div></div><p>I currently use Mandrake 7.2. I upgraded from a previous
Mandrake version. I noticed the May 2001 letter (&ldquo;Mandrake 7.2
Review&rdquo;) and feel I must speak up in defense of the review.</p><p>Overall, I am pleased enough with the product (obviously,
since I am still using it). However, I must admit the March 2001
<i  >LJ</i> review's overall tone agreed with my
opinion of the product.</p><p>I could go on about many things, but I'll just bring up a
few. Their graphical installation is not anywhere close to robust.
After I finally got the install done on my laptop, I responded in
e-mail with a list of bugs, gotchas, etc., but did not get a reply.
Many of the DrakConf programs have more than their share of bugs.
For example, I have gotten into the habit of starting printer
configuration (PrinterDrake) to do just one thing at a time. I exit
the entire program before starting it up again to do another thing
with it. I abandoned RpmDrake. It was very promising but simply
didn't work.</p><p>I manually upgraded many RPMs in January from one of their
mirror sites. Most of these upgrades were security related and
didn't fix problems like these.</p><p>In short, I would prefer honest reviews over the watered-down
&ldquo;you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours&rdquo; kind.</p><p>&mdash;Harry Rockefeller</p><p>See our review of Mandrake 8.0 on page 78.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9d870"></a>Searching for Meaning</h2></div></div><p>I just received the June 2001 issue of the <i  >Linux Journal</i> today. The front cover shows a small ship (looks
like a cross between a steamer and a cruise ship) circling the
globe. Is this a (subtle) advertisement for the Linux Lunacy Geek
Cruises, or is there a deeper meaning to it?</p><p>&mdash;Vivek Bhatiavivekb@cs.ucf.edu</p><p>It's as deep as the answer to &ldquo;How many surrealists does it
take to screw in a lightbulb?&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9dad8"></a>Offensively Offended</h2></div></div><p>I am surprised and offended that your fine publication has
seen fit to sneak in religious references (Matthew 9:17) in the
June 2001 Best of Technical Support, page 96. Perhaps one of your
staff members has a religious agenda that he wishes to impose on
others. It has no place in a technical publication.</p><p>&mdash;Noel Moss</p><p>The reference is not religious but literary. The passage
alone contains nothing religious and makes a good metaphor for the
question answered.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19a5580.0x1a9dce8"></a>It Wasn't Me</h2></div></div><p>As the founder and project leader of the Linux Terminal
Server Project (LTSP), I'd like to tell you how excited I was to
see the LTSP article in the June 2001 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>It seems like the project is really becoming a mainstream
feature of Linux. I'd also like to point out that while I think
that Jorge did a great job in writing the article, I think it may
give some people the impression that we have written our own
bootroms. The bootrom images that we have had on our web site are
entirely the works of Etherboot Project
(<a href="http://Etherboot.sourceforge.net" target="_self">Etherboot.sourceforge.net</a>),
which is led by Ken Yap. We had them available for download, just
as a courtesy to people who want to get started quickly. We now
refer people to the ROM-o-matic.net site. Marty Connor has done an
excellent job of setting up that site, where you can select options
on the screen and have a bootrom image generated within seconds,
which you can then download and write to a floppy disk for
testing.</p><p>I've always tried to make it clear that we, at the LTSP,
didn't really invent anything new here, we just pulled together
several technologies that have existed for years and made it easier
for the average sysadmin to deploy.</p><p>If we've been successful at that, it is only because we are
standing on the shoulders of giants (to quote Isaac Newton and
Linus Torvalds).</p><p>Thank you for a wonderful magazine as always.</p><p>&mdash;Jim McQuillanLinux Terminal Server
