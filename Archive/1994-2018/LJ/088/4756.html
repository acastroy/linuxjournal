    Adjusting assembly language routines for higher performance from
    Alpha processors.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0500"></a></h2></div></div><p>API NetWorks is a leading developer of
high-performance, high-density servers. As such, we (and our
customers) are acutely sensitive to system performance issues. With
the majority of our customers running Linux on Alpha-based systems,
we pay close attention to key open-source components and packages
to ensure we don't inadvertently leave performance &ldquo;on the
table&rdquo;.
</p><p>In the proprietary world, improvements unearthed after
software product releases are saved for the next version. In the
world of open-source software, the time between improvements can be
measured in hours or days. In addition, tuning techniques are
shared quickly for the enhancement of the communal knowledge base.
With this in mind, we examined the assembly language routines in
the Linux kernel, with an eye toward taking advantage of the
micro-architectural features of the latest Alpha 21264 (also known
as ev6) processor.</p><p>We discovered that by rewriting a handful of routines in the
architecture-specific portion of the Linux kernel to take advantage
of the features of the 21264, we could attain significant speed
improvements, amounting to a 40% reduction in overhead for some
workloads. This article describes how and why these optimizations
work, so that others may be able to use these techniques to boost
their Alpha applications performance. For an e-mail server running
on a 21264-based Alpha, for example, applying these tuning tips
will enable it to scale to higher loads, extending performance
beyond where it would normally tend to taper off. End users will
feel as though their system is running faster; systems managers
will be pleased because they won't have to buy another system as
soon to handle increased traffic.</p><p>In the case of the Linux kernel, the performance-critical
routines are carefully (and conveniently) separated by architecture
and mostly implemented in assembly language. While there is a large
body of developers continually working to improve the algorithmic
performance of the kernel, there are only a handful of developers
with the requisite interests, skills and knowledge to enable them
to tune these assembly routines to extract the maximum performance
from a processor. Most of these developers are tuning code for x86
systems; the relevant Alpha code base had been dormant for quite
some time prior to our tuning.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence and previous measurements suggest a
disproportionately large amount of time was spent inside the
Linux/Alpha kernel when running various web and networking servers.
Given that the number of known performance-critical routines in the
Linux kernel is relatively small (20-30 assembly language
routines), it made sense to sort through them to make sure the code
was written with the 21264 in mind. A quick reading of these
routines revealed they had been carefully hand-scheduled for the
previous generation of Alpha CPUs, the 21164 (also called
ev5).</p><p>While the difference may seem minor, the 21264 differs
significantly from the 21164 at the micro-architectural (chip
implementation) level, having features that result in roughly
double the performance of the 21164 at the same clock speed.</p><p>Before detailing the performance improvements, it is useful
to note some of the differences between the 21164 and 21264
processors (see Table 1).</p><p><a href="4756t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Comparison of Alpha 21164
and 21264 Processors</a></p><p>After realizing a careful rewrite could yield significant
performance gains, we undertook the tuning of the Alpha assembly
language routines in the Linux kernel. (There have been attempts to
solve dynamically and automatically the problem of efficiently
running binaries compiled for older versions of Alpha CPUs on new
Alpha CPUs1, but that is beyond the scope of this article.)
Specifically, it was clear that about 20 routines in
linux/arch/alpha/lib and four to six routines in
linux/include/asm-alpha needed to be rewritten to take full
advantage of the features of the 21264.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0920"></a>Improvement Sources</h2></div></div><p>From an internal perspective, the 21264 is a significantly
more complex and powerful CPU than the older 21164. Because of
these differences, the nature of the performance improvements can
come from transformations (discussed below) involving the
rescheduling of the code in order to keep the processor from
stalling on fetch, avoid branch and branch target penalties, avoid
replay traps from occurring where possible, use the instruction
latencies and scheduling rules of the 21264, use instructions
available in the 21164 and 21264 that had not been used, use
instructions newly available in the 21264 and not use some
instructions if possible on the 21264.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0a28"></a>Preventing Fetch Stalling</h2></div></div><p>When writing code to avoid fetch stalling, one must ensure
the instructions dynamically encountered in a fetch block do not
result in one or more of the functional units being
over-subscribed. On the 21264 it is also important to ensure that
branch targets are aligned on a fetch block boundary. Given that it
fetches four instructions at a time, branch targets should have an
alignment of 0mod4 instructions, equivalent to an address alignment
of 0mod16.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0b30"></a>Avoiding Branch Penalties</h2></div></div><p>It is particularly important to avoid branch penalties on the
21264. Sophisticated, trainable branch prediction logic is built in
and works effectively if only one control flow change instruction
is in a fetch block (a &ldquo;quad-pack&rdquo;). In the 21164-tuned kernel
assembly language routines, there are a number of places where
multiple control-flow change instructions occur within a quad-pack.
Additionally, branch targets were aligned to 8mod16 addresses,
which often resulted in branch target labels appearing in the
middle of a quad-pack. While these sequences run quite well on a
21164, they run relatively slow on a 21264.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0c38"></a>Avoiding Replay Traps</h2></div></div><p>Replay traps occur when the processor must roll back the
state of memory to force accesses to a particular memory location
in order to be sequential, or when there are different-sized
accesses to the same memory location. But the code context in the
modified routines was such that replay traps were not an issue, so
rewriting sequences to avoid replay traps was unnecessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0d40"></a>Instruction Latencies of the 21264</h2></div></div><p>The instruction scheduling and slotting rules for the 21264
are too complex to list here, but for those interested in the
details, the 21264 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Compiler Writer's Guide</em></span> is
an excellent reference.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b0ea0"></a>Available but Unused Instructions</h2></div></div><p>Byte- and word-sized loads and stores were introduced in the
21164A (ev56) processor, but they were not used in the original
versions of the assembly language routines. Prior experience (in
the context of static binary translation of applications) has shown
performance can be typically improved 10% to 20% by utilizing these
instructions. This is particularly true for the stw (store word)
and stb (store byte) instructions, as it eliminates memory traffic
in a way guaranteed to cause replay traps on the 21264. In the
context of the tuned-up kernel routines, these instructions were
helpful, but it was typically localized to the tail code of large
region copies, while the bulk of the data movement used eight-byte
granularity load and store instructions.</p><p>The Alpha architecture also features various forms of
pre-fetch instructions. Pre-fetch instructions are hints to the
memory subsystem to fetch a block of memory to the data cache for
future consumption. These do not normally appear in compiled code,
as few compilers have enough context available to permit their
generation; Compaq's compilers do generate pre-fetch instructions.
In the context of moving large amounts of data, it is possible (and
desirable) for the assembly language programmer to utilize
pre-fetches. The __asm__() feature of gcc enables programmers to
insert relevant pre-fetch instructions at key points in routines
when rewriting entire routines in assembly language is undesirable.
Because they can minimize or prevent data-cache stalls, using these
instructions can significantly boost performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b1000"></a>New Available Instructions</h2></div></div><p>The 21264 is the first Alpha implementation to include
support for three instructions useful for boosting performance:
CTLZ, CTTZ and WH64.</p><p>The CTLZ and CTTZ instructions count the number of
leading/trailing zeros in a 64-bit register and are handy for
string manipulation. When a program performs string operations
involving pattern matching (strlen() matches on NULL), it is often
the case that the byte-number index of the pattern match in an
eight-byte value in a register is needed. Without CTTZ, it takes
about ten instructions involving multiple CMOVxx (conditional move)
instructions to determine this index. The result is a reduction in
code size (always useful), as well as a decrease in the number of
cycles needed to perform string operations. Also, there are some
filesystem primitives involving finding holes in a bitfield where
these instructions are useful.</p><p>WH64 (write hint for 64-bytes) is a memory subsystem hint
that a specified 64-byte region is going to be written to in the
near future. The processor can pass this information to the memory
subsystem, which can invalidate the target contents and avoid some
number of memory system cycles to keep the memory state coherent.
Since a process context switch entails moving large amounts of
information in memory from one place to another, any improvement in
copying performance between kernel-space memory and user-space
memory is good news. Meanwhile, program load time is another place
in the operating system that depends upon doing a lot of
memory-to-memory traffic. The program bits all have to get mapped,
and all of the zeroed memory (.bss in executables) must have zeros
written to it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b11b8"></a>Instructions to Avoid</h2></div></div><p>The CMOVxx conditional move instructions on the 21264 have
been implemented in the hardware by decomposing them into two
separate instructions inside the processor. The result of the
latency of a CMOVxx instruction is a minimum of two cycles, and can
take up to five cycles, depending upon the number of CMOVs in a
given fetch block. In some situations, replacing CMOV instructions
with highly predictable conditional branches can result in a
performance gain on the 21264. Overall, a good rule of thumb is to
try to minimize the number of CMOV instructions if possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b12c0"></a>Data Collection and Test Methodology</h2></div></div><p>The data was collected from an API NetWorks' CS20 server,
which has dual 833MHz processors with 4MB DDR cache, 1GB of SDRAM
and Ultra-160 SCSI disks. Two load-generation tests were run: five
builds of the 2.2.18 kernel and five builds of gcc-2.95.3. The
average system time (as reported by /usr/bin/time -p) was recorded,
using various levels of parallelism with
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> (see Tables 2 and 3).</p><p><a href="4756t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Load-Generation Test
Results of the 2.2.18 Kernel</a></p><p><a href="4756t3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Load-Generation Test
Results of gcc-2.95.3 Kernel</a></p><p>A similar version of the experiment was run using the 2.4.2
kernel in default mode (all of the performance patches exist). The
results were compared to an unpatched 2.4.2 kernel with most (but
not all) of the performance changes reverted.</p><p><a href="4756t4.html" target="_self">Table 4. Load-Generation Test
Results of Default 2.4.2 Kernel</a></p><p><a href="4756t5.html" target="_self">Table 5. Load-Generation Test
Results of gcc-2.4.2 Kernel</a></p><p>This experiment was initially performed on an API NetWorks'
UP1000 motherboard system, which has a 700MHz processor with 4MB
cache, 128MB SDRAM and IDE disks. Again, five builds of the kernel
and gcc were run, and the average times were recorded. The kernel
used was 2.4.0-test6, with and without the patches.</p><p><a href="4756t6.html" target="_self">Table 6. Test Results of UP1000
System Running 2.4.0 Kernel</a></p><p><a href="4756t7.html" target="_self">Table 7. Test Results of UP1000
System Running gcc-2.4.0 Kernel</a></p><p>On a modestly configured 21664 system (the UP1000), the
performance increase is significant in terms of reducing the amount
of time spent in the kernel, with improvements in the 40% range for
some activities (kernel builds). On a more generously configured
CS20, we consistently attained speed increases of 14-15% for the
measured loads.</p><p>We attribute the differences between the UP1000 and CS20
systems to be related to their memory: the UP1000 has an 800MB/sec,
64-bit bus, while the CS20 has a 2.65GB/sec, 256-bit bus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22b8580.0x23b19a0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>All of the rewritten routines have appeared in one form or
another (some have undergone subsequent rewriting) as part of the
2.4.2 kernel. Additionally, we have put together a patch for 2.2.17
of the kernel and made it available on our corporate web site,
<a href="http://www.api-networks.com/products/downloads/developer_support" target="_self">http://www.api-networks.com/products/downloads/developer_support/</a>
under &ldquo;Performance&rdquo;. Through additional efforts, these
improvements have also migrated into glibc and will eventually help
improve application performance of user-mode code.</p></div></div>
