uses these kinds of applications out of sheer necessity, not
because they're within an arm's reach of &ldquo;exciting&rdquo;. If databases
themselves don't bore new users into out-of-mind experiences, the
books that come with them usually do. Usually, the books assume
knowledge users don't have, speak above/below the user's
comprehension level or leave out all the useful pieces of
information.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL: Introduction and Concepts</em></span>
(Addison-Wesley, 2000) is an excellent introduction, not only to
PostgreSQL in particular, but to databases in general. It takes the
novice database user through all the steps of the TEST database and
does so without obfuscation or confusion. For the seasoned database
designer/maintainer, it offers a wonderful reference to programming
interfaces (including PHP, Embedded C and Python),
<span   class="bold"><b>pgsql</b></span> commands and other features
unique to PostgreSQL.</p><p>As of this writing, the book is in its second printing,
having sold a massive 2,155 copies in the first month after its
release last November. Given the increasing number of people making
the transition to open-source software, and the number of people
who need a good reference manual for database servers, the need for
a book such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL</em></span> is evident.</p><p>Momjian, a founding member of the PostgreSQL Global
Development Team, has included a wide range of information on
topics ranging from basic database setup to more senior
administrative subjects, such as host/hostssl connections, backing
up/restoring databases and internationalization. The average user
will learn to run <span   class="bold"><b>psql</b></span> to access
her/his database, enter data, view existing tables and make
queries.</p><p>This is not, however, merely a glorified HOWTO: numerous
features in <span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL</em></span> are useful to
programmers, webmasters/mistresses, as well as DBAs. There are a
fair number of programming interfaces for PostgreSQL, broadening
its potential uses among computer professionals. This book
certainly unlocks much of that potential in its discussion of the
languages PostgreSQL can interface with, complete with sample
programs illustrating the process.</p><p>The book is just as informative about what can be done with
this database software as it is about how to do it. From this
perspective, it is a success. It is not, however, perfect.</p><p>Some organization is present&mdash;a good thing to be sure in a
book about databases. The trouble is, it's apparent that Momjian
hasn't been around database newbies for a while. Were &ldquo;Appendix B:
Installation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chapter 2: Issuing Database Commands&rdquo; and the
first portion of &ldquo;Chapter 20: Administration&rdquo; all put together,
the new PostgrSQL user would have an easier time setting things up.
As it is, one wanders around those three sections for a while,
trying to get the hang of things. Momjian has included a fair
amount of information about database setup and user creation in
&ldquo;Administration&rdquo;, which makes sense if he assumes the user will
be on a network that is administered by a seasoned DBA. It is
inappropriate, however, for an individual who wants to create and
maintain a database on a single-user system. Get ready for a lot of
flipping back and forth if you fall into the latter
category.</p><p>I believe every technical book should have three qualities:
good indices, clear writing and wise use of appendices.
Regrettably, Momjian has included appendices to the tune of 50% of
the book, which tends to detract from his work and gives the reader
a sense of the book being padded. Certainly an appendix with
additional resources is moderately helpful, but a reader shouldn't
need a FAQ listing for software that is on the Internet. Such
information is best left on-line. The reference manual, included in
Appendix D, is helpful but large enough (nearly 200 pages!) to
warrant its own cover or reference (with its URL) as an additional
resource in Appendix A.</p><p>That said, the remainder of the book is well thought out, and
the content of chapters is in accord with their titles.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c8058"></a>Technical Glitches</h2></div></div><p>There are some commands that, according to the book, should
work but don't. To be fair, this could be a discrepancy between the
version used to test the book's commands and the version in current
use. The most recent release is 7.0.3; testing of some of the
commands was done with 6.5.3. (If you're using the 6.5.3 release,
it would be best to update it; if you're involved in the release of
a Linux distribution, you'll want to clamor for the inclusion of a
more recent version of PostgreSQL.) When I tried CREATE USER I
got:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sjb=&gt; CREATE USER paa;
CREATE USER
sjb=&gt; CREATE GROUP alteregos WITH USER sjb, paa;
ERROR: parser: parse error at or near "group"
</pre><p>Several variations of this were attempted with the same
results. An associate attempted the same commands using the same
release of the software, with the same results. Such situations
are, alas, not addressed in the book.
</p><p>NULL/NOT NULL values also represent problems with this
version of the software, at least on the Red Hat 6.2 and Storm
2.0.6 systems that were used. While the author of the book isn't
necessarily responsible for these errors, it would have been
helpful if possible workarounds were included in the book. There is
no recognition that PostgreSQL has its &ldquo;moments&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c8268"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Aside from some relatively minor problems as mentioned above,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>PostgreSQL</em></span> is a solid reference for
constructing, manipulating and managing a database. As the software
grows, so will its audience. As to whether it's worth the purchase
price, one of the best things about this book is its availability
on-line. If you are a PostgreSQL guru and need only an occasional
reference, you might well forego purchasing the book and use the
on-line version. Otherwise, it's a remarkably good
investment.</p></div></div>
