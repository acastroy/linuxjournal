for program development for the Linux operating system. Borland is
creating a commercial market for Linux that has been poorly
represented until now. Borland is embracing the Linux community by
making certain Kylix components open source and releasing an open
edition of Kylix at no cost (expected sometime in the summer of
2001).</p><p>Kylix is an integrated development environment (IDE) for the
creation of software. More importantly, it is a rapid application
development (RAD) tool that provides components for quick
development of database connectivity, internet content and
graphical user interfaces (GUIs, see Figure 1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4781f1.large.jpg"><img src="4781f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Kylix</p></div></div>
</p><p>Kylix took two years to create, which in my experience is a
short development time for a product so diverse and complex. I had
heard of it for the first time one year into its development and
have been waiting eagerly to use it ever since. Borland brings back
memories of my first commercial programming language Pascal, and I
was interested to see how things have progressed over the years. In
addition, my copy arrived taped to the bottom of a Borland
skateboard&mdash;Borland is tapping into those good old memories.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x1667df0"></a>First Test&mdash;Dive Straight in</h2></div></div><p>My first test was to try to create a GUI front end to my
MySQL database. I was unsuccessful, even though it looked really
easy at the Borland demo. Unfortunately, you must read the tutorial
book before using Kylix. In a sense, the fault is mine as my
experience is developing applications on UNIX platforms using
products like KDevelop, whereas Kylix essentially is based on the
Windows mindset. The differences are subtle but enough to force you
to read the manual.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x1667ef8"></a>What Does It Offer?</h2></div></div><p>The Kylix editor is definitely one of the most capable
editors I have ever seen for Linux. Apart from color highlighting
program sections while you type, it attempts to predetermine what
you are typing (including programming constructs) and assists you
with function parameters and class elements (see Figure 2). This
feature also analyzes a class declaration and automatically creates
functions with default content. Emacs fans can rejoice, as the
editor can be set to handle Emacs key mappings.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4781f2.large.jpg"><img src="4781f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Code Insight</p></div></div>
</p><p>Okay, there is something really sneaky about the
compiler&mdash;it's just too fast. When I created my first program in
Kylix, I pressed the compile button and nothing happened. So I
pressed it again. I only then realized the program compiled so
quickly that the compiler had finished its job while my clicking
finger was still coming to a rest. The compiler is available as a
command-line program, <span   class="bold"><b>dcc</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>dcc</b></span> also incorporates the linker.
This is particularly useful for batch builds and development
without the IDE for those die-hard
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> power users or text terminal
development.</p><p>Debugging is the standard useful fare. It is a good
implementation but nothing extraordinary (like changing the code
while debugging and carrying on execution without restarting the
program). I was extremely pleased to discover that GDB supports the
Kylix-generated binaries. Unfortunately, I could only use GDB to
debug at machine code level as the symbol table failed to load. I
either was using an incorrect version of GDB or did not have a
correct compilation flag set. The Kylix debugger and GDB provide a
win-win situation for beginner and advanced users alike (see Figure
3).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4781f3.large.jpg"><img src="4781f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Debugger</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Kylix GUI builder is a good commercial front-end builder
(see Figure 4). Kylix extends what is usually expected from GUI
builders (as RAD components), such as database connectivity and web
server tools (which have nothing really to do with the GUI), by
actually representing them via the GUI. This use of nonvisual RAD
programming components in the GUI allows for easy access to
associated GUI front ends.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4781f4.large.jpg"><img src="4781f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Form Designer</p></div></div>
</p><p>The one thing I did expect, but did not find, was a graphical
way of setting up relationships between GUI components, for
example, connecting a button via a line to a dialog box to
establish a relationship between the button and the dialog box
(such as a button click to close the dialog). This sort of
graphical-relationship building is available in several other
products, most notably Trolltech's Qt Designer for the Qt Widget
set. As a side note, Kylix uses the Qt Widget set as a base for its
cross-platform components (CLX).</p><p>Since I was using the Server version of Kylix, I had access
to all the components that are available from Borland (see Figure
5). There are some excellent web server utilities for development
with Apache. The database components are part of a collection
called dbExpress. The dbExpress philosophy retains the live data in
the computer's memory, and only when an update is initiated or
needed is the data sent to the actual database. This approach
apparently prevents extended locks on the database and cuts down
unnecessary network traffic.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4781f5.large.jpg"><img src="4781f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Components
</p></div></div><p>I was disappointed that there was no OpenGL component.
Granted, Kylix is aimed primarily at business users, but a little
3-D in an application is always a welcome sight.</p><p>As far as project maintenance, Kylix provides a to-do list
that can be shared amongst a development team. The Code Explorer
allows quick perusal of the code structure. An object repository
allows project members to share sections of work. Although Borland
assured me source control products, such as CVS, could be
integrated with Kylix, a third-party interface product needs to be
developed to support it.</p><p>Another problem is that the documentation is inadequate. For
a $2,000 product, I expect several good books included in the
package. All that is included is a well-written tutorial book that
covers only the basics and really needs to be expanded to provide a
good springboard for new Kylix developers. The program reference
guide is sufficient but is obviously not a substitute for the
on-line documentation. Fortunately, the on-line documentation
provides good coverage and includes many examples. What is really
missing is a guide for C/C++ programmers for Kylix and the Object
Pascal programming language or some sort of computer-based training
(CBT) introduction. Most Linux application programmers are C/C++
programmers, and a guide like this would have been a nod to the
Linux platform. I strongly recommend that new Kylix developers read
the whitepapers on Borland's web site, particularly when coming to
grips with the database and web components.</p><p>There are three editions of Kylix: Open, which is available
for free (downloadable) for noncommercial GPL development (or $99
US for a hard copy version); Developer, for commercial use with a
limited number of features and components ($999); and Server, with
all of the features and components ($1,999).</p><p>I was really hoping that the $99 version would be a
stripped-down version that would allow you to create personal or
small commercial products. The Open edition is available on the
condition that any code that is produced with it using CLX must be
released under the GPL. This implies that the source code of these
programs is to be made publicly available. Although this has great
open-source merits, it does effectively prevent a majority of
commercial development. It looks like the $999 Developer version is
the cheapest commercial-quality one and that there does not seem to
be a cheap commercial version that matches the Delphi standard
edition for Windows.</p><p>However, the Borland community is undoubtedly strong and
helpful. The on-line documents and newsgroups are an excellent and
necessary source of information. Most of my difficult problems were
answered by reading the Borland newsgroup messages. In addition,
several Borland folks have an active and helpful presence on the
newsgroups
(<a href="http://www.borland.com/newsgroups" target="_self">http://www.borland.com/newsgroups/</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165f5a0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>I tried to install Kylix on several Linux distributions.
Unfortunately, the supported Mandrake 7.2 did not install cleanly,
and I had to use Borland's libc to circumvent the installation
problem. A Linux system, which I have hacked together from various
bits and pieces, had no problem installing and running Kylix. To
assist potential Kylix developers, Borland has made a Kylix
pre-test tool to check if your Linux installation has all the
required components. You can download the Kylix pre-test tool from
<a href="http://www.borland.com/devsupport/kylix/downloads" target="_self">http://www.borland.com/devsupport/kylix/downloads/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165f700"></a>Programming</h2></div></div><p>The initial version of Kylix supports the Object Pascal
programming language, which is a merger of Pascal, Modula 2 and
object-oriented concepts. The language is probably easier to learn
for absolute programming beginners as it is closer to the English
language, very much like a scripting language. My major gripe was
getting used to the := symbols for assigning variable values. While
programming, I appreciated the Kylix editor that helps you to
program and use the components.</p><p>The Borland component library for cross platforms (CLX) is a
strange beast, particularly for a seasoned Motif/Qt/Java
programmer. Its API names and relationship logic have a Windows
flavor and take some time to get used to and understand what
function or class will do what you want. Borland has also released
CLX as open source on the sourceforge.net site at
<a href="http://freeclx.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://freeclx.sourceforge.net/</a>.
CLX covers all the core elements needed to build a graphical
application.</p><p>Regarding databases, although Kylix supports MySQL, it has a
major problem at the time of this writing for it only supports the
MySQL with the library libmysqlclient.so.6.0.0. Please note that
any other version, later or earlier of libmysqlclient.so, will
cause your application to crash. This caused me a lot of hassles,
and I was not alone; a quick look at the newgroups showed others
with a similar problem. However, once you get past the setup
difficulties, creating database applications for Linux has never
been easier. Due to the nature of the Borland's database approach,
it is actually possible to have a database that resides in memory
only and then dump it as a binary or XML file on your local system.
Borland provides components to connect to several of the major
databases, particularly Oracle. It is possible to create your own
database support as well.</p><p>Although an OpenGL interface is provided on a second CD and
is downloadable from
<a href="http://www.delphi-jedi.org/DelphiGraphics/index.htm" target="_self">www.delphi-jedi.org/DelphiGraphics/index.htm</a>,
it was fairly clear that it had not been tested extensively (also
indicated by the lack of comprehensive examples). I had enormous
trouble getting the GLUT toolkit for OpenGL to work and eventually
abandoned the effort.</p><p>One thing the Kylix team might have overlooked is that Linux
programmers may want to develop a command-line program to do some
background task. For these kinds of applications, one generally
uses the C/C++ argc/argv parameters to obtain the command-line
arguments. Although there are several possible ways of doing it
inside Kylix, none of them seemed to work. I had to search the
Internet before I found a fairly obscure way of copying memory to
obtain the argc/argv data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fa18"></a>Portability</h2></div></div><p>One of the major attractions of Kylix is the ability to
develop applications on Linux and then port them to Windows using
Delphi. Granted there are several restrictions, but if you stick to
using the Kylix API set, CLX, you are on a clean porting
path.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fb20"></a>Third-Party Extensions and Tools</h2></div></div><p>To make Kylix even more attractive to developers, several
third-party extensions and tools are available, ranging from UML
support to code profiling. A companion CD shipped with Kylix makes
many of these available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fc28"></a>The Linux Competition</h2></div></div><p>Kylix not only faces competition from proprietary Linux IDEs,
such as SNIFF+, SlickEdit and CodeWarrior, but also from the
open-source projects, mainly KDevelop, Qt Designer, KDE Studio and
several others. However, none of these provides the number of
components and scope of Kylix. In this area Kylix is the definite
winner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fd30"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Although Kylix is an exciting product, it does cater to a
certain audience: existing Delphi programmers and development teams
aiming for portability of an enterprise/business application to
Linux and Windows. The main problem, of course, is the Object
Pascal programming language itself. It might not be enough to
convince C/C++ programming shops to swap over to Kylix yet.</p><p>Borland is hoping to release a Kylix version that supports
C++ at the end of this year. It may be actually possible to compile
the Linux kernel with this version of Kylix (or so I have heard).
Now, this is really a product to be excited about&mdash;a possible GCC
killer?</p><p>Another enhancement that Borland might address in the future
is support of architectures other than Intel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fee8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Kylix is an extensive development product and delivers more
than any other commercial equivalent for Linux through its
business-oriented components. Borland is serious about being part
of the Linux community and has shown this by releasing the Open
edition for no cost to download and $99 for physical media, as well
as making the CLX components available as open source. If the
Object Pascal programming language is not an issue, Kylix is the
development tool for commercial Linux development. The Open edition
serves the Open Source community. Although there are one or two
hiccups, Borland has bravely paved the way for commercial
development on Linux.</p><p><a href="4781s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
