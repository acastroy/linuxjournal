    Everywhere I look, I see (and install) more and more Linux desktops.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f83f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Well, it looks like all the big boys (Red
Hat, Caldera, Mandrake, etc.) have thrown in their hats and said,
&ldquo;Linux is not ready for the desktop.&rdquo; At least that's the
message. Hey, Microsoft, you won without a fight! I don't know what
the CEOs of these companies are smoking, but it must be very strong
stuff. Everywhere I look, I see (and install) more and more Linux
desktops. And you know what? The folks for whom I do the installs
don't understand why they couldn't have a desktop before that was
this robust, this good, this inexpensive. But these now publicly
held companies I mentioned above are talking about 1) raising the
price and 2) charging a per-CPU license. As far as they're
concerned, the free ride is over. Time to pay the Linux
distributors. If I didn't find Debian's GNU politics so annoying,
I'd start using it. Maybe it's time to start my own distro? Or at
least one for my clients? At least that would eliminate the
unpleasant surprises that accompany each new release, and I could
decide what's best for my clients rather than using a distribution
whose creators seem increasingly out of touch with what's happening
with their VARs and customers.

</p><p>Now this is nice (and convenient).
<span   class="bold"><b>webCDwriter</b></span> lets you surf over to
your web server/CD burner and burn a CD of files on your local
machine across the network. This is truly convenient, and any user
can do it. In fact, its simplicity and ease of use may be its
biggest drawback. You may find your CD burner is suddenly running
overtime burning CDs from all over your network. No more excuses
for not having a burned copy of important files and directories
because the CD burner is on a remote system, and it's inconvenient
transferring the files. Guess I'll have to invent yet another
excuse. Requires: Java, cdrecord, mkisofs, web server, web browser
w/ Java support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f8710"></a><span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes</em></span>:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://heroes.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://heroes.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p><p>This particular game is a cross between
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Snakes</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Nibbles</em></span>, based
on the old DOS <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes</em></span> game. The graphics are
quite good, and game play is fast. The complete
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes</em></span> code includes a large number of
soundtracks, more levels than most normal gamers can play in a
night and several game modes. Requires: libm, libmikmod,
libpthread, libdl, libSDL, libartsc, libX11, libXext, glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f8a80"></a>Port Scan Attack Detector:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad" target="_self">http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad/</a>
</p><p>This Perl utility takes advantage of
<span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span> logging and uses the
logged information to determine whether the system is under attack.
The parameters are highly configurable.
<span   class="bold"><b>psad</b></span> can send an e-mail to the
administrator when it sees a scan. The e-mail will include custom
whois information. This is a fairly simple but effective tool
(along the lines of <span   class="bold"><b>courtney</b></span>), but
it doesn't put your Ethernet card in promiscuous mode and will
watch only those ports you have logging on. Requires: Perl, Perl
modules: Socket, Getopt::Long, File::Stat, and Data::Dumper.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f8d98"></a>iptrap:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.jedi.claranet.fr" target="_self">http://www.jedi.claranet.fr/</a>
</p><p>If you are very paranoid or just under attack often (as my
servers are), you can block offending IPs quickly and easily with
this tool. I tested it on my local system that does not run mail.
Telling it to block any host hitting port 25, I Telnet to another
system, then Telnet back to the local system on port 25.
Instantaneously, I had a rule inserted in the input chain. I had
told it to REJECT rather than use the default DROP, and the
resulting iptables rule showed a reject with port-unreachable.
Nice. This will be put to good use. Can also run external scripts
that e-mail you the output from a `dig -x &lt;offending IP&gt;`.
Requires: glibc and iptables (or ipchains).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f8f50"></a>Password Expiration Agent:</h2></div></div><p>download only:
<a href="http://frida.fri.utc.sk/~behan/devel/passwd_exp" target="_self">http://frida.fri.utc.sk/~behan/devel/passwd_exp/</a>
</p><p>This script, run daily, will look through your /etc/shadow
file and send an e-mail to any user whose account is about to
expire or be disabled. Personally, as an administrator, I like to
get the list and send out notifications where appropriate myself.
But if you have a lot of accounts or just don't want to bother,
this is the way to do it. Requires: Perl, Perl modules provided by
author (RcRecord.pm, spent.pm).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f9108"></a>Linux Terminal Server Project:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.ltsp.org/index.php" target="_self">www.ltsp.org/index.php</a>
</p><p>I don't know if any of you have had the need to set up a
diskless workstation on a system served from another Linux system
via TFTP. I remember the ordeal well. The HOWTO was woefully
inadequate in many parts. So, I decided to repeat the experiment
using <span   class="bold"><b>ltsp</b></span>. In just about 30
minutes, it was up and running. Okay, so I had a head start having
done it once before. Drawback: unless you're running Red Hat,
Debian or Caldera, be prepared to do it by hand or hack the install
scripts. (That's what I had to do on my Caldera system because it
didn't understand Caldera 3.1, only 2.4.) Requires: installed and
running XDM, KDM or similar, DHCP server, TFTP. Workstation capable
of a network boot or floppy boot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f9318"></a>gTaxEstimator:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://www.gtx.seul.org" target="_self">http://www.gtx.seul.org/</a>
</p><p>Tax time is past, but it's coming around again fast. And
while gTaxEstimator isn't yet ready for prime time, it could be by
next tax season. Personally, I'm hoping for support for Schedule
2555 soon. The interface is simple and clean. This is probably the
most promising piece of software I've seen in a while. Let's face
it, if you live in the US (or even if you don't but are a US
citizen), there's no escaping the Internal Revenue Service.
Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libm, libz, glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2000580.0x20f94d0"></a>Make CD-ROM Recovery Utility:</h2></div></div><p><a href="http://mkcdrec.ota.be" target="_self">http://mkcdrec.ota.be/</a>
</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>mkCDrec</b></span> utilities allow
you to do several different things. They allow you to make an
el-torito bootable CD for system rescue. They also allow you to
back up your entire system to multiple CDs. You'll also need the
mkCDrec utilities if you want to do system restores. You can backup
systems that don't have burners, either by creating the iso
image(s) and transferring them for later burning or using NFS to
write the ISO image(s) to the system with the burner and burn
later. Either way, this utility is convenient. Requires: Running
system w/ mkisofs gzip, access to a system with cdrecord, mkisofs,
gzip.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
