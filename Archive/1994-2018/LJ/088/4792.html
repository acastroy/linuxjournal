trouble staying focused on this menu. My mind, it keeps wandering.
Eh? Well, you see, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, the topic of this
month's issue is platforms. I keep thinking about launch pads. You
know, <span   class="emphasis"><em>la navette</em></span>, the space shuttle,
catapults, all sorts of launchers. Even when I try to get my head
out of the clouds and try to focus on our Linux systems, I think
application launchers. I think my brain, it is stuck on this whole
launch pad business.
</p><p>What? But Fran&ccedil;ois, surely you know what I mean by
application launchers. The big foot in the bottom left-hand corner
of that GNOME desktop at table eleven is an example, just like the
big K on the KDE desktop at table six. Then, of course, there are
the little buttons on KDE's kicker or GNOME's panel. Nevertheless,
people have been experimenting with other ways of launching
applications for a long time. For instance...ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bienvenue</em></span>! Welcome to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois and I were just
discussing application launchers, and I was about to give him some
examples. Please sit down and be comfortable.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, what are you doing just sitting there?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Du vin, mon ami</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>!
The 1989 Alsace Riesling is drinking wonderfully. It is time to let
our guests sample its grandeur, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois.</p><p>I was showing Fran&ccedil;ois the program launchers in KDE
and GNOME, but there are other desktops out there, and besides, we
still put icons on our desktops for easy access. For those of you
who, like me, enjoy a little Window Maker from time to time, let me
start you off with a single-button dock application that is really
quite good despite its name. Written by Alexandre Beraud and
Emmanuel Sunyer, WMbad is a good little program launcher with some
slick features such as theme support and scroll or fade effects
between applications. Just click the arrow and watch the little
pixmaps slide from one to the other.</p><p>Why would you do such a thing? That is a good question. Well,
I don't know about you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, but my
desktop is at times a little, shall we say, crowded. A small launch
application that requires little room does not seem like such a bad
idea. Have a look at Figure 1 for a picture of WMbad in
action.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4792f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Not much space. Not bad for WMbad.
</p></div></div><p>You will of course want to build this yourself,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Start by picking up the source tarball at
<a href="http://perso.mnet.fr/esunyer/wmbadeng.html" target="_self">perso.mnet.fr/esunyer/wmbadeng.html</a>.
The installation is easy but with a few more steps than we are used
to. There is a theme and pixmap directory that need to be copied
into your home directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf wmbad-0.3.0.tar.gz
cd wmbad-0.3.0
make
make install
mkdir $HOME/.bad
cp config.bad $HOME/.bad
cp alpha.xpm $HOME/.bad
cp -R pics $HOME/.bad
cp -R themes $HOME/.bad
</pre><p>Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci</em></span>. Please, pour
for our guests. I promise you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, you
will love this wine. Meanwhile, the compile, as you can see, is
done. You can now start the application by typing <b  >wmbad
&amp;</b>. Everything you need to customize WMbad is
available from the application itself. Need a quick xterm? Just
click the little bar on the left-hand side. Click on the little
round button on the right-hand side and an editor session pops up
allowing you to update the config file. You will find the format
extremely easy to work with, see the following sample. Note the
line that reads &ldquo;Commands number&rdquo;. If you add commands, you need
to increment that. For instance, in the following example, I have
seven scrolling commands defined (the default file has four):
<pre     class="programlisting">
[Theme pixmap]
default.xpm
[NONE/SCROLL/STORE]
SCROLL
[Commands number]
7
[Com 1]
emacs
editor.xpm
</pre>


Now, I happen to know that some of you are running AfterStep. The
next item on our menu is for you. Actually, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, this can be for everyone since I have run it from
my KDE and Window Maker desktops. The application is called
<span   class="bold"><b>asbutton</b></span> and comes to us from Ryan
Lathouwers. You can get the latest copy at
<a href="http://home.pacbell.net/ryanlath/asbutton.html" target="_self">home.pacbell.net/ryanlath/asbutton.html</a>.
</p><p>Next, unpack the source and build your launcher:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf asbutton-0.3.tar.gz
cd asbutton-0.3
make
make install
cp .asbuttonrc $HOME
</pre><p>The final command copies the default configuration file to
your home directory. The format of the file is simple and well
documented so adding additional commands should be very easy. If
you are eager to see the program in action with its default batch
of commands, then launch the asbutton program launcher (ahem) by
typing <b  >asbutton &amp;</b>.
</p><p>If you should wish to run a nine-button configuration, as
opposed to the four-button default, use the -n 9 flag. In order to
make the space used by this tiny launcher as productive as
possible, each button can launch multiple applications. Click the
left button and the <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program
starts. Use your right mouse button instead and you launch
<span   class="bold"><b>xosview</b></span>. Do that with nine buttons
and you have one-click access to 18 programs while taking up a
meager 64 &times; 64 pixels (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4792f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. asbutton Program
</p></div></div><p>If you do wish to have this startup attached to your
AfterStep wharf, then add the following line to your wharf
configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*Wharf asbutton - Swallow "asbutton" asbutton  &amp;
</pre><p>If you are having trouble locating it, the wharf config file
should be located at $HOME/GNUstep/Library/AfterStep/wharf.
</p><p>Another such launcher I would like you to look at is
attractive because of its name. Would you believe
<span   class="bold"><b>minibar</b></span>? Upon looking at Michael
Eddington's minibar, I was at first disappointed to find it
completely empty of even a humble table wine. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Le
truc</em></span>, in this case, was to remind myself that this is
software and not a real minibar. This is a small, vertical program
launcher that takes up virtually no room on your desktop. The icons
are tiny, providing single-click access to whatever commands you
see fit. For starters, pick up your copy at
<a href="http://www.phed.org/miniProject" target="_self">http://www.phed.org/miniProject/</a>.</p><p>A little word of warning here, and no, I do not mean that you
should be careful not to overindulge in the souffl&eacute;. Indulge
all you like, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois, more
wine! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non</em></span>, what I am talking about is this.
There is a precompiled binary included with the distribution, but I
ran into runtime library problems. The simplest way to deal with
the problem is to extract the software, remove the old binary, then
build anew:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf minibar-0.05.tar.gz
cd minibar-0.05
make clean
make
make install
cp minibarrc $HOME/.minibarrc
</pre><p>As you can see, the last step involves copying a
configuration file into your home directory. Once again, this is a
simple file to work with. Each button (and command) is defined
simply (see Figure 3). For instance, if I wanted to add a button
that started a copy of the GIMP, I would add these lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/include/X11/pixmaps/mini-palette.xpm
The GIMP
gimp
</pre>


<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4792f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. minibar
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The first line is the path to one of your mini-icons (the
installation copies a handful into your /usr/include/X11/pixmaps
directory), but you can use other mini-pixmaps on your system or
create your own. In the following example, I had a 48 &times; 48
PNG image for the GIMP that I wanted to convert to a 16 &times; 16
size and then save as an xpm file. A little ImageMagick and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
convert -geometry 16x16! gnome-gimp.png gimp.xpm
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>convert</b></span> program is part
of the ImageMagick suite of tools and is likely already installed
on your Linux system. Other interesting commands you may wish to
explore include <span   class="bold"><b>mogrify</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>identify</b></span>. If, perchance, you do
not have ImageMagick installed, check your installation CD-ROM or
visit
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org" target="_self">http://www.imagemagick.org/</a>.
</p><p>The truth, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, is that application
launchers like these are simple menus with a little flash. Since
the core is still simplicity, I thought I would add one final item
on today's menu, one that is more closely related to the other type
of launch pad. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oui</em></span>, it is time to launch our
ships into space and protect our fair planet from invading alien
hordes. In keeping with our theme of simplicity, allow me to
present you David Slimp's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl Defense
Blaster</em></span>. This is an arcade-style game written entirely
in Perl that runs on an ASCII screen with very simple graphics. It
is also strangely addictive. Get your copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl
Defense Blaster</em></span> at
<a href="http://perlblaster.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://perlblaster.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p><p>You may also need to visit CPAN
(<a href="http://www.cpan.org" target="_self">http://www.cpan.org/</a>) to
pick up a couple of modules: Curses.pm and TermReadKey.pm. You can
also get these via FTP at the following addresses:
<a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Curses" target="_self">ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Curses</a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Term" target="_self">ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/Term</a>.</p><p>It is true that I have covered the process for installing
Perl modules before, but nevertheless, here is a quick reminder. We
will use the Curses.pm module as an example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/temp_dir
tar -xzvf Curses-1.05.tar.gz
cd Curses-1.05
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
</pre><p>Because <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl Defense Blaster</em></span> is just a
script (and consequently another excellent opportunity for
experimenting with Perl code, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?), all you
have to do is extract the source and run it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf perlblaster-0.1.0.tar.gz
cd perlblaster-0.1.0
./perlblaster &amp;
</pre>


Use the &ldquo;4&rdquo; and the &ldquo;6&rdquo; on your numeric keypad to move side to
side and the &ldquo;5&rdquo; to fire. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bonne chance</em></span>! The
fate of our world depends on your skill and lightning reflexes,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? For a peek at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl Defense
Blaster</em></span> in action, have a look at Figure 4.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4792f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Perl Defense Blaster</em></span>
</p></div></div>

</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Et bien, mes amis</em></span>, the time has come
once again for us to raise our glasses one final time.
Fran&ccedil;ois will happily refill your glasses once more before
you leave us. I hope that you have enjoyed today's menu and that
you will join us again next time. Thank you once again for coming.
Until next time, please join us here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
