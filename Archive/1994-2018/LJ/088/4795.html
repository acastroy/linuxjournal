    As predicted, 2001 shapes up as &ldquo;The Year of Linux in
    Devices&rdquo;.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28f8580.0x29f06b8"></a></h2></div></div><p> Last year, I said 2001 would be the year
embedded Linux starts popping up in all kinds of &ldquo;smart devices&rdquo;,
consumer-oriented and otherwise. It looks as though my prediction
is materializing on schedule, despite the popping of the
dot-com/Linux bubble and the ensuing economic downturn.
</p><p>In this month's column, we take a take a brief look at three
recently announced consumer products that have Linux embedded
inside: an Internet/TV from Sylvania, a personal server from Memora
and a Mobile Multimedia Communicator from Galleo.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28f8580.0x29f0818"></a>The Sylvania Internet/TV</h2></div></div><p>This summer, Sylvania Computer Products is expected to
introduce a new 27-inch digital TV that combines the functions of a
TV with those of an internet appliance. The device, which owes its
internal intelligence to a single-chip PC running an embedded Linux
operating system, marks a key milestone in the television industry
by being one of the first consumer TVs to include a built-in
internet appliance. Call it the dawn of the Internet/TV.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4795f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Sylvania's new SPC2700iHD marks the dawn of the Internet/TV.
</p></div></div><p>Sylvania's new Internet/TV, designated to be Model
SPC2700iHD, includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A high-resolution HDTV-ready monitor with a
built-in conventional TV tuner.</p></li><li><p>An embedded internet appliance computer that
supports dial-up (56K) and broadband (Ethernet) internet
access.</p></li><li><p>Linux-based operating system with an easy-to-use
graphical user interface that unifies TV watching and internet
viewing.</p></li><li><p>A combination remote/keyboard/mouse to simplify
system operation.</p></li><li><p>Internet-based control and database
services.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Internet/TV receives broadcast and cable TV signals via
its built-in TV tuner, but it is also usable as a high-resolution
display for external video sources, including VCRs, DVD players,
DSS, cable boxes and computers (up to 800 &times; 600 SVGA
resolution).
</p><p>The system's internal CPU is a 266MHz National Semiconductor
Geode, equipped with 64MB of RAM and a 16MB nonvolatile Flash disk.
Its long list of input/output ports includes an IR receiver for
interfacing with its remote/keyboard/mouse device, an IR blaster
for sending data to external devices, two USB ports, a 100Mb
Ethernet port, a 56K phone line modem, composite video
inputs/outputs with L/R audio, S-video input with L/R audio and
high-resolution RGB video input for either HDTV or
computer-generated SVGA input.</p><p>The real power of the Sylvania Internet/TV comes from a
combination of internal software and on-line services created by
Ch.1, Inc.
(<a href="http://www.ch1.com" target="_self">http://www.ch1.com/</a>). Ch.1
licensed hardware and software technology for the device to
Sylvania and also serves as an Internet/TV service provider. The
unit's so-called Ch.1-enabled functions are used to watch TV,
browse the Internet, create web and TV favorites, view a customized
programming guide, access preprogrammed category portals, send
e-mail, chat, shop and listen to MP3s. You can even watch a TV
program while simultaneously interacting with its associated web
site using the set's Picture-in-Portal technology, or you can
direct your VCR (or HDR) to record through Ch.1's web-based control
screen. On-screen buttons give you easy access to the Internet/TV's
user manual, product or accessory upgrades, customer service and
technical support.</p><p>Notably, unlike solutions based on adding an Internet access
settop box to a conventional TV, the Sylvania Internet/TV lets you
browse the Web with full 800 &times; 600 SVGA resolution. And if
you want the comfort of typing with a full-size keyboard, you can
easily add one as an optional accessory. So, this device may be the
ticket to internet access for the roughly 50% of consumers that
don't already own a PC. And best of all, they'll all be
(unknowingly) Linux users!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28f8580.0x29f10b0"></a>The Servio Personal Server</h2></div></div><p>New England startup Memora Corporation
(http://www.memora.com/) hopes to establish a new product category,
the &ldquo;personal server&rdquo;, with its Linux-based Servio, an
easy-to-use appliance-like device that integrates a combination of
services increasingly in demand in today's &ldquo;well-connected&rdquo;
homes: gateway, firewall, wired/wireless network server, e-mail
hosting and shared storage of multimedia and other files. Besides
offering these capabilities within the home, the device also offers
secure external access (via the Internet) to e-mail, web pages and
designated files. According to Memora, the personal server
functions as &ldquo;a single point of presence for organizing,
accessing, and sharing [users'] digital information when, where,
and with whomever they choose&rdquo;.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4795f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Memora's Personal Server lets users organize, access and share
their digital information when, where and with whomever they
choose.
</p></div></div><p>The Servio Personal Server is essentially a small (and unique
looking) Linux-based computer system, not too different from an
ordinary desktop PC, that requires no keyboard or display to
operate. Inside there's a 600MHz (or faster) Intel Celeron
processor with 128MB of memory and a 30GB hard disk. External
input/output connections consist of two fast Ethernet (10/100
Mb/sec) ports and two USB ports. One Ethernet port typically
connects to a DSL modem, while the other goes to an in-home LAN.
The USB ports let you connect the device to wireless LANs and other
supported external interfaces.</p><p>The Servio's internal software consists of Linux, some other
open-source programs (including the Apache web server, MySQL and
the Exim mail server) and a set of Memora-written programs that
control the configuration and operation of the device. The latter
are browser-based applications that, among other things, integrate
e-mail, database and web services.</p><p>The system comes preconfigured for plug-and-run operation by
nontechnical users. You simply hook it up between a broadband
connection (DSL or cable) and a local (wired or wireless) network
inside your home. Next, you turn on the power and let the system's
auto-configuration program discover your network's settings.
Finally, using any PC browser, you enter your name and a public
name for the device. If everything goes as expected, you're now
ready to set up accounts for friends, associates and family
members, and begin sharing photos, video clips, music, files and
take advantage of the other services provided by the device.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28f8580.0x29f1478"></a>The Galleo Mobile Multimedia
Communicator</h2></div></div><p>Galleo (http://www.galleo.com/) [see the July/August 2001
issue of our sister publication, <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>, for further details on the Galleo] recently
announced a Linux-based Mobile Multimedia Communicator. Like
several other newly-announced handheld computers with wireless
connectivity, the device combines the functions of a PDA, web
appliance and cellular phone. Galleo's device comes with software
that supports cellular phone communication, internet access, web
browsing, PIM applications, multimedia (MP3 player, streaming
video), games and personalized content, plus IPSec-compliant VPN
network security.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4795f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Galleo's Mobile Multimedia Communicator combines the functions of a
PDA, web appliance and cellular phone.
</p></div></div><p>According to Galleo product manager Yovav Meydad,
patent-pending cellular communication technology delivers an
&ldquo;always on, always connected&rdquo; data communication capability that
represents &ldquo;a credible alternative to WAP&rdquo; and &ldquo;gives the end
user the same [web browsing] experience [as on a desktop PC] while
he is on the move&rdquo;. &ldquo;Fit-to-page&rdquo; software with zoom/pan
functions allows viewing standard web pages on the unit's
landscape-mode quarter VGA display. Another aid to using unmodified
on-line content and services is an included Java Virtual
Machine.</p><p>A full-featured web browser supports HTTP 1.1, HTML 4.0, XML
1.0, JavaScript, SSL, TLS, RSA, VPN, Personal Java 1.2 JVM and
display of PNG, GIF and JPEG images. MP3 player, media player and
video-streaming functions are also included, as are a full PIM
suite including functions for e-mail, calendar, tasks, contacts,
notes and data synchronization.</p><p>The user interface supports pen and touch input using a
stylus with software that provides handwriting recognition and an
on-screen keyboard, plus a few hard keys. A built-in joystick is
intended to support gaming and simplify web site navigation.</p><p>Inside there's a 206MHz Intel StrongARM SA-1110
system-on-chip processor equipped with 32MB system RAM and 16MB of
nonvolatile Flash disk. Its display is a bright, full-color, 320
&times; 240 pixel TFT LCD. The unit provides input/output
interfaces for RS-232 serial, USB, infrared (IrDA) and stereo audio
(for headphones/MP3 connection). There is also a pair of expansion
slots for additional memory and secure data cards. A built-in
cellular telephone module supports dualband GSM, GPRS, TriCodec and
fax/data transmission at 14.4 kbps. Galleo plans to support CDPD
for the North American market but plans to introduce the device
first in Europe, where GSM and GPRS are making their initial
appearance.</p></div></div>
