The Linux kernel, the core of any Linux distribution, constantly is
evolving to incorporate new technologies and to improve performance,
scalability and usability. Every new kernel release adds support for
new hardware, but major version upgrades of the kernel, such as the
2.6 Linux kernel, go beyond incremental improvements by introducing
fundamental changes in kernel internals. Many of the changes to the
internals of the 2.6 Linux kernel have a significant impact on the
overall performance of Linux systems across the board, independent of
hardware improvements. The 2.6 kernel provides substantial
improvements in system responsiveness, a significant reduction in
process- and thread-related kernel overhead and a commensurate
reduction in the time between when a task is scheduled and when it
begins execution.
</p><p>
Released in late 2003, the 2.6 kernel now is the core of
Linux distributions from almost every major Linux vendor in the
enterprise, desktop and embedded arenas. Kernel and system
performance are critical to focused markets such as embedded
computing, where high-priority tasks often must execute and complete
in real time, without being interrupted by the system. However, system
performance and throughput in general equally are important to the
increasing adoption of Linux on the desktop and the continuing success
of Linux in the enterprise server market.
</p><p>
This article discusses the nature of real-time and system parameters
that affect performance and highlights the core improvements in
performance and responsiveness provided by the 2.6 kernel. Performance
and responsiveness remain active development areas, and this article
discusses several current approaches to improving Linux system
performance and responsiveness as well as to achieving real-time behavior. Kernel
and task execution performance for various Linux kernels and projects
is illustrated by graphed benchmark results that show the behavior of
different kernel versions under equivalent loads.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd01580.0xdf9450"></a>
Latency, Preemptibility and Performance</h2></div></div><p>
Higher performance often can be realized by using more and better
hardware resources, such as faster processors, larger amounts of
memory and so on. Although this may be an adequate solution in the data
center, it certainly is not the right approach for many
environments. Embedded Linux projects, in particular, are
sensitive to the cost of the underlying hardware. Similarly, throwing
faster hardware and additional memory at performance and execution
problems only masks the problems until software requirements grow to
exceed the current resources, at which time the problems resurface.
</p><p>
It therefore is important to achieve high performance in Linux systems
through improvements to the core operating system, in a hardware-agnostic
fashion. This article focuses on such intrinsic Linux performance
measurements.
</p><p>
A real-time system is one in which the correctness of the system
depends not only on performing a desired function but also on meeting
a set of associated timing constraints. There are two basic classes of
real-time systems, soft and hard. Hard real-time systems are those in
which critical tasks must execute within a specific time frame or the
entire system fails. A classic example of this is a
computer-controlled automotive ignition system&mdash;if your cylinders
don't fire at exactly the right times, your car isn't going to
work. Soft real-time systems are those in which timing deadlines can
be missed without necessarily causing system failure; the system can
recover from a temporary lack of responsiveness.
</p><p>
In both of these cases, a real-time operating system executes
high-priority tasks first, within known, predictable time frames. This means
that the operating system cannot impose undue overhead in task
scheduling, execution and management. If the overhead of tasks
increases substantially as the number of tasks grows, overall system
performance degrades as additional time is required for task
scheduling, switching and rescheduling. Predictability therefore is
a key concept in a real-time operating system. If you cannot predict
the overall performance of a system at any given time, you cannot
guarantee that tasks will start or resume with predictable latencies
when you need them or that they will finish within a mandatory
time frame.
</p><p>
The 2.6 Linux kernel introduced a new task scheduler whose execution
time is not affected by the number of tasks being scheduled.
This is known as an O(1) scheduler in big-O algorithmic notation,
where O stands for order and the number in parentheses gives the
upper bound of worst-case performance based on the number of elements
involved in the algorithm. O(N) would mean that the efficiency of the
algorithm is dependent on the number of items involved, and O(1)
means that the behavior of the algorithm and therefore the scheduler,
in this case, is the same in every case and is independent of the
number of items scheduled.
</p><p>
The time between the point at which the system is asked to execute a
task and the time when that task actually begins execution is known as
latency. Task execution obviously is dependent on the priority of a
given task, but assuming equal priorities, the amount of time that an
operating system requires in order to schedule and begin executing a
task is determined both by the overhead of the system's task scheduler
and by what else the system is doing. When you schedule a task to be
executed by putting it on the system's run queue, the system checks to
see if the priority of that task is higher than that of the task
currently running. If so, the kernel interrupts the current task
and switches context to the new task. Interrupting a current task
within the kernel and switching to a new task is known as kernel
preemption.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the kernel cannot always be preempted. An operating
system kernel often requires exclusive access to resources and
internal data structures in order to maintain their consistency. In
older versions of the Linux kernel, guaranteeing exclusive access to
resources often was done through spin-locks. This meant the
kernel would enter a tight loop until a specific resource was
available or while it was being accessed, increasing the latency of
any other task while the kernel did its work.
</p><p>
The granularity of kernel preemption has been improving steadily in
the last few major kernel versions. For example, the GPL 2.4 Linux
kernel from TimeSys, an embedded Linux and tools vendor, provided both
an earlier low-latency scheduler and a fully preemptible
kernel. During the 2.4 Linux kernel series, Robert Love of
Novell/Ximian fame released a well-known kernel patch that enabled
higher preemption and that could be applied to the standard Linux
kernel source. Other patches, such as a low-latency patch from Ingo
Molnar, a core Linux kernel contributor since 1995, further extended
the capabilities of this patch by reducing latency throughout the
kernel. A key concept for the TimeSys products and these patches was
to replace spin-locks with mutexes (mutual exclusion mechanisms)
whenever possible. These provide the resource security and integrity
required by the kernel without causing the kernel to block and wait.
The core concepts pioneered by these patches now are integral parts of
the 2.6 Linux kernel.

Approaches to Real-Time under Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Three projects for real-time support under Linux currently are active:
the dual-kernel approach used by the RTAI Project and by products
from embedded Linux vendors such as FSMLabs; a real-time Linux
project hosted by MontaVista, an embedded Linux vendor; and freely
available preemptibility and real-time work being done by Ingo
Molnar and others, which is discussed openly on the Linux Kernel
mailing list and which the MontaVista Project depends upon. In
addition to these core kernel projects, other supporting
projects, such as robust mutexes and high-resolution timers, add
specific enhancements that contribute to a complete solution for
real-time applications under Linux.
</p><p>
The dual-kernel approach to real time is an interesting approach to
real-time applications under Linux. In this approach, the system
actually runs a small real-time kernel that is not Linux, but which
runs Linux as its lowest-priority process. Real-time applications
specifically written for the non-Linux kernel using an associated
real-time application interface execute within that kernel
at a higher priority than Linux or any Linux application, but they can
exchange data with Linux applications. Although this is a technically
interesting approach to running real-time applications while using a
Linux system, it avoids the question of general Linux kernel
preemption and performance improvements. Therefore, it is not all that
interesting from a core Linux development perspective.
</p><p>
MontaVista's Project to further real-time Linux leverages much of the
existing work being done by Ingo Molar and other Linux kernel
contributors, but it includes some additional prototype patches
available only on the MontaVista Web site. The current patches
available there are for a release candidate for the 2.6.9 Linux kernel
(rc4). Therefore, they did not apply cleanly against official drops of
the Linux kernel, which is moving toward 2.6.11 at the time of this
writing. As such, the results from this project could not
be included in this article.
</p><p>
The real-time, scheduling and preemptibility work being done by Ingo
Molnar, the author of the O(1) Linux scheduler, and others has a
significant amount of momentum, enhances the core Linux kernel and
provides up-to-date patches designed to improve system scheduling,
minimize latency and further increase preemptibility.
</p><p>
These patches have an enthusiastic following in the Linux community and
include contributions from developers at many different groups and
organizations, including Raytheon; embedded Linux vendors such as
TimeSys; and from the Linux audio community. These patches provide
capabilities such as heightening system responsiveness and minimizing
the impact of interrupts by dividing interrupt handling into two
parts, an immediate hardware response and a schedulable interrupt
processing component. As the name suggests, interrupts are requests
that require immediate system attention. Schedulable interrupt
handling, more commonly known as soft IRQs, minimizes the impact of
interrupts on general system responsiveness and performance.
</p><p>
The illustrations in the next section focus on comparing benchmark
results from various vanilla Linux kernels against those obtained by
applying the real-time, scheduling and preemptibility patches
done by Ingo Molnar and others. These patches are up to date and
provide complete, core Linux kernel enhancements that can provide
direct benefits to Linux users who want to incorporate them into
their projects and products.

The Sample Benchmark</h2></div></div><p>
In 2002, the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site published an article titled &ldquo;Realfeel Test of
the Preemptible Kernel Patch&rdquo;, written by Andrew Webber. This article used an
open benchmark called Realfeel, written by Mark Hahn, to compare
preemption and responsiveness between the standard Linux 2.4 kernel
and a kernel against which Robert Love's preemption patch had been
applied. Realfeel issues periodic interrupts and compares the time
needed for the computer to respond to these interrupts and the
projected optimal response time of the system. The difference between
the time when an interrupt request is issued and when it is handled is
an example of latency, and the difference between predicted and actual
latency is known as jitter. Jitter commonly is used as a way of
measuring and comparing system responsiveness.
</p><p>
This article uses the same benchmark application as Webber's article
but imposes substantially more load on the system when measuring results.
This is a technique commonly applied when benchmarking real-time operating
systems, because even non-real-time operating systems may exhibit low
latencies in unloaded or lightly loaded situations. The graphics in the
next sections also present the results differently to make it easier to
visualize and compare the differences between latency on various Linux
kernels.

Benchmark Results</h2></div></div><p>
The results in this section were compiled using a medium-strength
Pentium-class system with a single 1.7GHz AMD Athlon processor and
512MB of system memory. The system was running the GNOME desktop
environment and the system processes associated with the Fedora Core 3
Linux distribution, with up-to-date patches as of Feb 10, 2004. The
system kernels tested were a vanilla 2.6.10 Linux kernel, the
2.6.10-1.760_FC3 kernel available as a Fedora Core 3 update, a vanilla
2.6.11-rc3 kernel and a 2.6.11-rc3 kernel with Ingo Molnar's current
real-time and preemption patch. All of these kernels were compiled
against the same kernel configuration file, modulo new configuration
options introduced in the newer kernel sources.
</p><p>
In multiprocessing operating systems such as Linux, the system
never is dormant. System processes such as the scheduler always are
running. If you are using a graphical user interface (GUI), interfaces
such as KDE, GNOME or standard X Window system window managers always
are waiting for input events and so on. In order to examine true
preemptibility and real-time performance, additional load was imposed
on the system by starting various processes while each set of
benchmark results were being collected. As mentioned previously, the
system was running GNOME with four xterms open&mdash;one to run the
realfeel benchmark, another to run a script that constantly ran
recursive find and ls processes on the system's root partition and
two in which 2.6.x Linux kernels, with separate source directories,
were being compiled from a clean state.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows a plot of the results of the Realfeel benchmark run on
a stock Fedora Core system for a period of one minute. The system was
running kernel version 2.6.10-1.760_FC3, which is a 2.6.10 kernel with
various patches and enhancements applied by Red Hat. Each dot in the
figure represents the jitter between an interrupt request and its
handling. The X axis is the sample time in 1/60 of a second. Negative
jitter numbers are displayed when the system responded to the
interrupt faster than the projected standard time. As you can see
from the figure, a fair number of these interrupt requests were
handled exactly as expected, resulting in a visibly dark line along
the 0 value of the Y axis.

Figure 2 shows a plot of the results of the Realfeel benchmark run on
the same system with a vanilla 2.6.11rc3 kernel, which is release
candidate 3 of the upcoming 2.6.11 kernel. These results also were
collected over a period of one minute. As you can see from these
results, the 2.6.11-rc3 kernel provides improved results from the FC3
kernel, with many more instances where the jitter between an interrupt
request and its handling was zero.

Figure 3 shows a plot of the results of the Realfeel benchmark run on
the same system with a 2.6.11rc3 kernel to which Info Molnar's
real-time/preemption patches have been applied. These results
also were collected over a period of one minute, with the same load
generators as before. As you can see from these results, the
real-time/preemption patch provides impressively better jitter
results, with relatively few departures from handling interrupts
within the expected period of time. On the target system, these
improvements translate into a much more responsive system, on which
expectations about program execution are much more predictable than
they are when running the vanilla FC3 or stock 2.6.11-rc3 kernels.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
The improved scheduling, SMP and scalability improvements in the 2.6
Linux kernel provide higher performance Linux systems than ever
before, enabling them to make better use of system resources and more
predictably execute kernel and user tasks as requested by the
system. Further improvements are available but currently are
available only by patching your system manually or by obtaining a Linux
distribution from a vendor such as TimeSys, which already incorporates
and tests these high-performance patches.
</p><p>
The very existence of GNU/Linux as a free, open-source kernel and
robust execution environment is something of a marvel. The
contributions of individuals and, more recently, corporations to
improving its performance will lead to an even brighter
future. These and other improvements to Linux argue for and help
guarantee the adoption of Linux as the preferred operating system for
embedded, server and desktop applications.
