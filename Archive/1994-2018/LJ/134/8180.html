Sometimes the best lessons come from stories where almost nothing
goes wrong.
</p><p>
&ldquo;All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in
its own
way. All was confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had found out
that the husband was having an affair with their former French governess,
and had announced to the husband that she could not live in the same
house with him.&rdquo;&mdash;Leo Tolstoy, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Anna
Karenina</em></span>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ff580.0x22f7450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Stories are about problems. That's what makes them stories. They don't
start with &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo;. Properly equipped with interesting
causes for unhappiness, they tease us toward a resolution that arrives
after dozens or hundreds of pages. That's how the Oblonsky family made
great literature.
</p><p>
The Saugus Union School District is no Oblonsky family. It's too
happy. Sure, they had problems or they wouldn't have migrated to
Linux. But they did it fast and with hardly a hitch. Not great material
for Tolstoy, but perhaps a useful example for similar organizations
planning the same move.
</p><p>
Being both an educational and (after the migration) an open-source
institution, Saugus Union is eager to share those lessons with their
communities. So, after I asked in a recent column for migration stories,
the first person to respond was Jim Klein, Director of Information
Services and Technology at Saugus Union. And here I am, playing Tolstoy
for the School District. That's a little lesson in PR for the rest
of y'all.
</p><p>
The Saugus Union School District is a good-sized
public school system, containing a total of 15
schools and office sites serving 11,000
students in the southern California towns of Saugus,
Santa Clarita, Canyon Country and Valencia. Although
the district is regarded as an exemplary public
school system, it's also bucking for leadership as an
exemplar of resourceful and independent IT deployment
and operations. That's why the top item on its Web
site is &ldquo;Open Source Migration&rdquo;, a series of essays
explaining the project and passing along wisdom for other
schools.
</p><p>
Old-timers can guess what the district was migrating away from
when Jim Klein talks about moving from one NOS&mdash;network operating
system&mdash;to another. The NOS label was invented by Novell back in the
1980s. It was a positioning statement, against Microsoft's personal
operating systems.
</p><p>
Jim writes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When we first decided to use Novell solutions for our primary NOS, it
was really a no-brainer. Microsoft's Windows NT was the
only real alternative (sorry to those of you who were LANtastic fans),
and it didn't scale well for our 13 (at the time) locations (I
won't even go into the reliability issue, because I'm sure most of us
remember the days of weekly, scheduled reboots). Over the years, we have
continued to upgrade and stay current with Novell solutions, all the
while giggling as we read of the pain and suffering in Redmond's world.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
They kept up with what was happening in Redmond, of course, because
they used Microsoft Windows on plenty of desktops, even if they kept it off
the servers. Also, Jim adds, &ldquo;Let's face it, Novell wasn't winning any
popularity contests.&rdquo; This is when they were learning about what happens
when you're stuck inside a vendor's slowly depopulating silo.
</p><p>
Jim adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Then a funny thing happened&mdash;Novell
acquired SUSE in January 2004 and announced shortly
thereafter that it would be moving all of its
services to Linux. We had taken only a casual glance
at Linux up until that point and were seriously
considering Apple's Mac OS X server as a possible
migration option for some of our services. With
Novell throwing its weight behind Linux, especially
as an enterprise server platform (instead of an
application-specific server, as Linux is so often
relegated to in the media), we decided to take a more
serious look.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Because they wanted what they were accustomed to getting from
Novell&mdash;training, a choice of applications, documentation and support&mdash;they
quickly narrowed their choices to SUSE and Red Hat. Jim continues:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Because of our Novell background, our first choice was to look at
SUSE. Novell was more than happy to provide us with CDs, and although
we knew little of SUSE short of vague references, we went forward with
our evaluation. After running the installer several times (before we
got it to take), we looked at the basic functionality of the system. We
really didn't like the &ldquo;jello-like&rdquo; interface very much and had many
issues getting some of the most basic functions to work. So it was off
to the bookstore.
</p><p>
We knew from our research that SUSE was the number-two Linux
distribution on the market, so we were quite surprised to find zero,
that's right, zero books on SUSE Linux. The best we could find were
vague references in more generalized Linux documentation. Red Hat
documentation, on the other hand, was in abundance and on a variety
of topics of interest. So we bought a Red Hat book, which had a free
Fedora DVD in it&mdash;Red Hat: 1, SUSE: 0. Fedora installed on the first
try, and with the help of some good documentation, we were able to get
basic services working&mdash;Red Hat: 2, SUSE: 0. We explored more advanced
functionality, both desktop and server-oriented, and found that most
Web resources were, once again, Red Hat-oriented. We were able to get
Fedora to do just about anything we wanted&mdash;Red Hat: 3, SUSE: 0.
</p><p>
But we hadn't given up on SUSE yet. Armed with a
laptop, loaded with both SUSE and Fedora, we headed
off to Novell's Brainshare 2004 conference in early
April. Here we talked to everyone about every topic
of concern. We gleaned all we could about Linux in
the enterprise, spoke to techs about our concerns,
looked at Novell's solutions and so on. We spoke to
HP about our servers, explaining our concern over
Linux compatibility with our older machines. They
recommended Red Hat. We looked at Novell Nterprise
Linux Services and discovered nothing unique about the
implementations, other than that they were standard
open-source apps installed in strange locations. We
heard promises of real training programs somewhere
down the road and that documentation would be coming
soon. By the end of the conference, Novell had
convinced us of two things: 1) Linux is, in fact,
ready for the enterprise, and 2) that we didn't
need them any more. (Okay, that's a little harsh&mdash;we
are still using Novell GroupWise&mdash;on our Red Hat
servers.)
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The next step was what Jim calls &ldquo;trial by fire&rdquo;: installing Linux on all
the staff laptops and running &ldquo;solutions for everything we do on a
day-to-day basis&rdquo;. After a month of &ldquo;self-induced pain and
frustration&rdquo;, they
were well-conditioned for off-site RHCE (Red Hat Certified Engineer)
&ldquo;boot camp&rdquo; training. They also accumulated piles of books and other
documentation and set to work evaluating open-source replacements
for the applications they had been running on NetWare. Jim adds, &ldquo;Our
goals rapidly evolved from potentially using Linux for some services
to definitely using it for several services to 'can we use it for
everything?' to 'wow, I think we can use it for everything we
do.'&rdquo;
</p><p>
Jim's advice:
&ldquo;...it is important to establish, well in advance, which services you need
to provide, and what solution will provide said services. In some cases,
options may be a little sparse, while in others, myriad. In either case,
good documentation and research are critical to any
implementation.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Jim's use of the term services may seem innocuous,
but it originates in Novell's intentional shift of
the network paradigm in the 1980s. Before that shift,
every network was a silo of proprietary offerings
standing on a platform of &ldquo;pipes and protocols&rdquo; with
names like DECnet, WangNet, OmniNet, Sytek, 3Com,
Ungermann-Bass, Corvus and IBM's Token Ring. With
NetWare, Novell provided the first network operating
system that would run on anybody's pipes
and protocols and also on anybody's hardware. As
a platform, NetWare hosted a variety of network
services, starting with file and print. Craig Burton,
who led Novell's NOS strategy, called the new paradigm
the &ldquo;network services model&rdquo;. Services included
file, print, management, messaging and directory,
among others, eventually including Web. This is the
conceptual model by which we still understand networks
today. It's also one in which Linux makes a great deal
of sense&mdash;and why NetWare isn't too hard to replace.
</p><p>
The main services Jim and his crew wanted to support&mdash;directory, file,
print, Web, messaging (e-mail), DNS/DHCP and backup&mdash;had Novell offerings
that easily were replaced by OpenLDAP, Samba, Netatalk, Apache, BIND 9,
dhcpd, Squid and Bacula (&ldquo;dumb name, great solution&rdquo;, Jim writes). The
only remaining exception was Novell GroupWise 6.5, which lives on as a
proprietary application running on Linux.
</p><p>
They deployed gradually, starting with nonessential edge servers and
working their way to core servers and services:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We updated a Web server at the district office first and gradually added
services to it for testing purposes. Then, we updated the Web, proxy and
DHCP servers at two school sites. We added Samba to the servers so that
Webmasters could update their sites. Then we convinced an administrator
to let us install Linux on 30 laptops in a wireless cart. We learned
a great deal by starting small and building up to more and more services,
and the laptops taught us how to &ldquo;script&rdquo; the installation and rapidly
deploy through the use of Red Hat's Kickstart utility. Finally, it was
summer, and it was time for the bold step&mdash;full migration of 14
sites totaling 42 servers in six weeks.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
They deployed everything at the server end, including automated backups
for multiple PC platforms, in four weeks. Then they went out to the mass
of clients throughout the school district:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When the office staff returned and were given their passwords (we had
to change them as we are now on a completely different authentication
system), they went right to work. We proceeded busily to remove the Novell
software (except GroupWise) and join the new Windows domains (on the
Samba servers) on our 3,000 or so Windows machines in our school
classrooms and to update aliases and so forth on about 1,000 Macs....
</p><p>
When all that was said and done, we were pleasantly surprised by how
smoothly the transition went. While our 800 or so users (and
11,000 students) may know that we are running Linux, it is
relatively transparent to them. The Linux servers offer no indication
that they are running Linux. To the Windows machines, they look like
Windows servers. The Macs think they are Apple servers. Everything just
works. Sure, we were in a continual state of tweaking for a while, which
was understandable under the circumstances, but we did not (and have not)
had a single &ldquo;show-stopper&rdquo; of a problem.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The dollar savings weren't small, especially for a school system. Nearly
$54,000 US in licensing fees to Novell, plus $50&ndash;$200 per desktop
workstation. Less measurable but even more gratifying are the ongoing
time and hassle savings:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We are now able to install software, even if it has a GUI installer,
remotely, which has saved us a tremendous amount of time. Software
management and configuration is not only consistent, but accessible and
easily modified, as opposed to being hidden away somewhere in an obscure
directory object, registry entry or other mysterious location. In
addition, the myriad of management and configuration tools that were
required to manage the servers has been reduced, for all intents and
purposes, to one. And, thanks to the Red Hat Network, we now know, in
an instant, the status of all of our machines and what patches are needed
and are able to schedule automated updates district-wide at the click
of a mouse.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most interesting benefit we have enjoyed has been our newfound
ability to modify solutions to meet our needs....We have, on numerous
occasions, changed the way a script works or added functionality to a
software package. For example, we use the idealx-smbldap Perl scripts to
add, modify and delete Samba accounts from the LDAP directory. These
scripts, however, did not offer the ability to add such attributes
as a user's first name or title, which we needed for some of the Web
applications we are using. So, with absolutely no Perl experience
(although reasonable scripting/programming experience), we were able to
add this functionality to the scripts and enjoy the new functionality
immediately.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I was surprised that they deployed first on laptops, which are notoriously
less &ldquo;white-box-like&rdquo; than desktops. Sleep, for example, has always been
an issue.
</p><p>
Jim said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We used HP NX5000s mostly, quite a long time before
they started shipping SUSE on them, however. We also
used NC4000s and NC6000s. We put Fedora Core on all
of them, and do our installs via Kickstart. The big
benefit of Fedora is that we can host a local yum
repository and mirror Fedora updates (as well as other
sites), which makes it easy (and fast) to distribute
software and updates, through Red Hat's up2date. We
don't like SUSE very much, because of the way it
litters all the files all over the filesystem. It
adds an extra step when you are trying to find help,
as you first have to figure out what SUSE did with
all of the pieces.
</p><p>
Sleep still doesn't work right. There are some nice kernel patches to
make them hibernate, but they are a bit of work to install. We couldn't
get built-in 2.6 hibernate functions to work either. This is, by far,
our biggest headache with laptops. We have two batteries in all of ours,
though, so we can keep them running for the day with relative ease.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the laptops running Linux are working great. And we've
had no problems getting users to adjust. In fact, the only instruction
we've offered is, &ldquo;The little red hat in the start bar is the same as the
Start button on Windows&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Firefox is your Internet
browser.&rdquo; They've
been fine with all the rest. In fact, even trainers we've brought in
from outside have had no problem adjusting to the machines and completing
their tasks.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Craig Burton says &ldquo;There are always two kinds of problems, technical
and political. And the technical problems are usually easiest to
solve.&rdquo; Jim told me, &ldquo;The biggest help we got from Novell was political,
as they added credibility to open source through their name and industry
recognition.&rdquo; But, he added, &ldquo;We encountered no political problems (and)
almost no resistance because we came in fully informed, with all the
right answers.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I asked where he went for help during the
migration. Jim replied, &ldquo;Actually, Red Hat and
the Web were our sources. RHCE boot camp got me up
on the enterprise side of things and the Web worked for
everything else. I was surprised at how much help I got
from SourceForge forums and the like&mdash;even from the
programmers themselves. I put my techs through Linux
Professional Institute boot camp. One will attend
RHCE in the Spring.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I told Jim I often hear that, at large companies, migration is a trade
of licensing costs for personnel time. Was this also the case here?
&ldquo;I
suppose first year, you could say that&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;If I consider cost
in terms of our salaries and the amount of time we put into learning
and doing, training fees and support fees, you could say we broke
even. But then, we consider learning and research part of our job
description. Outside of salaries and time, actual cash outlays were only
$6,700, and savings are $50K+ per year, so I'd say we came out
ahead.&rdquo;
Today, the district is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 AS on 31 servers, and Fedora Core 1 on 11 older
servers that don't meet the minimum hardware requirements for the Enterprise product.
</p><p>
What were the licensing fees for exactly, I asked. Jim replied, &ldquo;We
were a Novell shop, so it's almost all Novell fees. Generally, it's $3
a kid for Novell ed licenses&mdash;we have 11,000 students. The rest would
be Veritas Backup Exec maintenance, Surf Control and so on.&rdquo;
</p><p>
When I asked about remaining problem areas, for higher-level application
migration, he said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The problem with that move is compatibility with
some of the multiuser educational software we use. Quarter Mile Math,
Follett Library Automation, Renaissance's Accelerated Reader, Scholastic's
Reading Counts and Orchard Software don't have Linux clients. We have
pretty healthy investments there. We have experimented with Follett
under Wine, and found that we can make the classroom portion work,
but have not, as yet, looked at the others.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I asked about adoption prospects at the desktop level. &ldquo;Several site
administrators have expressed an interest in Linux desktops as an
avenue for acquiring more machines for the same money, that is, to pay
less Microsoft tax&rdquo;, Jim said. &ldquo;Most of the immediate impact has been
an increased awareness of what's out there in open source. They use
the Linux laptops for training and learn that they can use the same
applications on their existing machines for free as well. Right now we
have multiple sites experimenting with open source on Windows and Mac
OS X, via OpenOffice.org, The Gimp and so on.&rdquo;
</p><p>
As for commercial educational software vendors, Jim adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We've seen
a fair amount of interest. For example, Follett server already runs on
Linux, and we helped Quarter Mile get its Java-based server to run on
Linux as well. I believe Scholastic is using a Java-based client now,
which would require minimal tweaking. Better support will probably
require pressure from a few good-sized districts. As we see upgrades
coming, we try to force the issue a bit.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Finally, I asked him if his experience offered
lessons for business enterprises. He replied:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I
think the biggest thing is that Linux can be done
successfully, on a multisite enterprise scale, and
that Linux truly is enterprise-ready. Most of what
they hear from the Microsoft camp is simply inaccurate
or incomplete analysis. We've already recouped our
costs, and more, and are thrilled with performance,
reliability and security. Add the fact that &ldquo;patch
management&rdquo; doesn't have to take up an entire salary,
and you'll find that there's more time for innovating
and less required for maintaining. I've rebooted my
servers once since last September, and it was because
I wanted them to reboot, not because they needed to or did it spontaneously on their own.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
If you want to know more, I'm sure Jim will keep reports current at the
Saugus Union School District Web site (<a href="http://www.saugus.k12.ca.us" target="_self">www.saugus.k12.ca.us</a>). The
story might not be worthy of Tolstoy, but it might be worth a lot for
the thousands of other school systems and mid-sized enterprises planning
similar moves.
