How do you put together a stable Linux distribution better and faster? Get

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c61298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Wow, time sure flies when you are having fun!
Seems like only yesterday I was sitting here writing
&ldquo;Constructing Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.3&rdquo; (see
the on-line Resources). Hard to believe that 16 months have flown
by so quickly, resulting in the launch of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux v.4 in February 2005. The last article
on v.3 provided a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the
challenges we face here at Red Hat in order to deliver
a robust enterprise-caliber Linux distribution.
Although we still face many of the same challenges
with the new release, there were many changes in how
we conduct business. In this article, I cover
the new challenges we faced and how we adapted to
address them.
</p><p>
Out of practical necessity, I cover
only a small fraction of the hundreds of features
and issues we address in a new Red Hat release.
Also for this reason, I am unable to identify
all of the literally hundreds of contributors, both
internal and external. Allow me to apologize up
front to my Red Hat friends who escape mention here
(it's not that you too aren't awesome).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c61450"></a>
The Stakes Get Higher</h2></div></div><p>
Truly the most remarkable trend in the computing
industry is the dramatic rise in Linux adoption.
Seemingly, every day, there are media alerts, on-line
articles, notifications from our peers in local
Linux User Groups (LUGs) and sales announcements
reporting large new user communities migrating to
Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
For example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Entire country governments, government agencies and departments.
</p></li><li><p>
Public school systems, from grade schools to universities.
</p></li><li><p>
Huge corporations increasingly are making Red Hat Enterprise Linux their
primary software development platform and engineering design
workstations.
</p></li><li><p>
Call centers and desktops.
</p></li><li><p>
Scientific research, public and private.
</p></li><li><p>
Telco and increasing usage in embedded appliances.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It is an immensely gratifying phenomenon to have
the work you do benefit a huge and swiftly climbing
user community. The collective user base of both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the Fedora community
version is well above a million users. In fact,
due to the proliferation of our software, it is
impossible to derive exact numbers to characterize
the popularity.
Given this
scope, all our developers have a strong sense
that their contributions truly have impact. There is
a betterment of humanity aspect that is inherent
with the spread of open-source software.
</p><p>
Given the great diversity of our user base, it becomes increasingly
challenging to meet its needs with a finite set of internal developers
and testers. In order to keep pace with the growing user base, we needed
to find a better way to scale our effectiveness. To accomplish this, we
had to look no further than the open-source model that is the core of
Red Hat's philosophy. That is, to involve a broader community of participants
in an inclusive &ldquo;early and often&rdquo; approach. This was the genesis of Fedora.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c61ad8"></a>
Fedora</h2></div></div><p>
Fedora is one of the main differences in the Red Hat Enterprise
Linux v.4 development as compared to Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.3.
There are several objectives of the Fedora
Project, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Providing a freely downloadable Linux distribution for interested
contributors. By aggregating the latest available versions of a great
diversity of packages, Fedora is an ideal incubator for new technology.
</p></li><li><p>
Providing a forum for external contribution and participation.
</p></li><li><p>
Forming a proving ground for new technologies that later may appear in an
upcoming Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The experiences gleaned from Fedora are invaluable
in the productisation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
The Fedora community consists of tens of thousands
of users. This volume is larger than the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux beta-testing audience. Through the
experiences of Fedora, we are able to get a solid
understanding of which package revisions and new
technologies are mature enough for inclusion in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux. The Fedora community members
were involved actively in many aspects of development.
</p><p>
A perfect example of community involvement in Fedora development consisted
of an external contributor developing an awesome Java application that
output diagrams illustrating where time was spent in the boot process.
This highlighted slow-starting system services. One such offending
service identified by this application subsequently had its starting
time corrected to take half a second rather than 20 seconds.
</p><p>
Portions of Fedora are even developed and
maintained entirely outside of Red Hat. A key example of this is the yum
package delivery and update technology. This shows how Fedora is free
to grow in many dimensions, unrestricted from Red Hat's agenda.
</p><p>
For those who demand the latest bleeding-edge
technology, Fedora is a perfect, free distribution.
For those who demand a more stable supported product,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the right choice.
The Fedora Project has moved ahead in the new
technology curve from Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4.
In this manner, it forms a glimpse of promising new
features that may appear in future Red Hat Enterprise
Linux releases.
</p><p>
The success of the Fedora Project truly has been win-win. Community
contributors and users receive a free vehicle to mature open-source
technology. Enterprise customers benefit from an increasingly feature-rich and mature product after completion of the stabilization phase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c62000"></a>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4 Requirements Planning</h2></div></div><p>
With this increasingly diverse user base comes a correspondingly large set
of requirements. Example requirements include bug-fix requests, software
feature addition and hardware enablement. By far, our biggest challenge
is to strive to prioritize customer bugs and feature
requests to identify the set that yields broadest general usefulness.
</p><p>
In the initial planning phases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4, we
carefully reviewed more than 500 feature requests. This was
accomplished in numerous marathon sessions of feature reviews interspersed
with countless hours of follow-up scoping of the viability and developer
time required to deliver. Below are some of the main themes we tried to
focus on in Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Security.
</p></li><li><p>
2.6 kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
Storage management.
</p></li><li><p>
Ease of use, particularly in the desktop.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Highlights of each of these main themes appear in upcoming sections.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c624d0"></a>
On-Site Partners </h2></div></div><p>
In addition to an increased user base since the
introduction of Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.3, we also
have fostered closer working relationships with
a growing set of hardware and software partners.
We recognize that the operating system itself is
only one layer in an overall solution stack that end
customers need in order to make Linux practical for
them in solving their computing needs. For this reason,
we work closely with our partners in terms of
identifying our priorities, aligning schedules and
addressing issues critical in enabling their hardware
and software.
</p><p>
Our hardware and software partners increasingly are seeing value in
working closely with Red Hat. Historically, it has been highly challenging
for us to accommodate the insatiable and diverse requirements from our
partners. As much as we would like to satisfy everyone, ultimately we
do have a finite staff and time frame in which to do this work.
In response, we have invited many of our partners to join us inside Red
Hat to work along side our developers to augment our staff to
achieve mutually beneficial objectives. For example, we currently have
multiple on-site staff members from IBM, Intel,
SGI, HP, Fujitsu and NEC. Here are some of the benefits:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Increased delivery of feature enhancements and bug fixes.
</p></li><li><p>
Better communication at the engineering level.
</p></li><li><p>
Faster turnaround time to address problems. When it comes to the short
time windows involved in new platform support, these efficiencies have
yielded support that otherwise would have been deferred to the
next update cycle.
</p></li><li><p>
Partners get an inside view into how the Open Source community
functions and how to become effective community participants.
</p></li><li><p>
Fostering friendships from people around the world.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The on-site partner contribution benefits the product set beyond
the parochial interests of the sponsoring company. For example, although
the SGI team's primary mission was support of their large CPU count
Altix platform, a side effect was overall improvement in scalability
in generic layers, which benefits all architectures. Another example
is the work the Fujitsu team accomplished by adding diskdump support.
Other hardware partners have augmented this support in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux to yield improved problem analysis capability by our collective
support organizations.
</p><p>
Numerous on-site partners are here from Japan.
We invited them to join us at Boulder Morty's
indoor rock climbing gym. It's amazing how much trust
it fosters to be hung 40 feet up on a rope with your
new-found friends. Given that English isn't their
primary language, I often wonder how much of the
introductory rock climbing instruction they understood
before we gave them the &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; thumbs up. Figure 1
shows the Red Hat and partner crew out for our weekly climbing session.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8074f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c62cb8"></a>
Security</h2></div></div><p>
One of the major themes of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
v.4 was security. Security considerations prevail
throughout the entire distribution. For example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Increased compile time checking for buffer
overflows, stack overflows, bounds checking,
initialization and correctness checks have been added
to the compiler. We have defensively incorporated
these checks into our internal build processes. Having
core GCC compiler developers on staff enables them
to provide such constructive recommendations for
defensive programming.
</p></li><li><p>
Increased kernel and runtime loader provisions to
prevent execution of malicious code and blocking of
common stack overflow techniques.
This has resulted in Red
Hat Enterprise Linux v.4 not being vulnerable to a
large class of exploits (see Resources).
</p></li><li><p>
Participation and monitoring of several industry
consortiums whose missions are to share security
exploit information and work on common resolutions.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c598b8"></a>
SELinux</h2></div></div><p>
SELinux refers to Security Enhanced Linux. Details of SELinux have been
presented in prior <i  >Linux Journal</i> articles (see Resources).
</p><p>
At its core, SELinux consists of a set of low-level primitives that
provide fine-grained access control. Prior to the advent of SELinux,
the Linux security model has been a rather all-or-nothing approach,
in that the two common cases were general unprivileged user applications
and privileged applications. The privileged applications typically
consisted of system services such as bind, Apache, MySQL, Postgres,
ntpd, syslogd, snmpd and squid. The historical down-side to having
all-powerful system services is that if they were compromised by a virus
attack or other exploit, the entire system could then become compromised.
</p><p>
SELinux provides a means of tightly restricting the
capabilities of user applications and system services
to a strict need-to-know authorization. For example,
it sets access control on the Apache Web server
 (httpd) to limit the set of files and
directories it is able to modify. Additionally,
Apache is strictly limited to what other applications
it is capable of executing. In this manner, if Apache
is attacked, the set of damage that can
occur is well contained. In fact, SELinux is so well
contained that one of Red Hat's developers, Russell
Coker has set up a Fedora system where he provides
the root password and invites anyone to see if they
can inflict damage to the system.
</p><p>
What is most monumental about Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4's SELinux
implementation is that it is the first widely adopted commercial
operating system to provide such fine-grained security integrated in
the newest release. Historically, it has been the case that such fully
featured secure operating systems have been relegated to obscure forks
of mainstream products, which typically have lagged a year
or two behind the respective new releases.
</p><p>
The implementation of SELinux got its tentacles into virtually all areas
of the distribution. This included:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Implementation of policies for the core system services.
</p></li><li><p>
Providing default policies for all RPM packages we provide.
</p></li><li><p>
Installer and system management utilities to enable end users to define
access domains of their own.
</p></li><li><p>
Kernel support throughout a range of subsystems.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There were many challenges in the implementation of SELinux. On the
kernel front, the core SELinux primitives were highly at risk of being
accepted into the upstream 2.6 Linux kernel.
James Morris valiantly completed the implementation and garnered
the required upstream consensus. On the user-level package front,
the introduction of SELinux required a specific or default policy
to be constructed for each package. Naturally, this at times was a
bumpy process as we sorted out which files should be writable and
other details.
</p><p>
Minor implementation glitches would wreak havoc across the entire
distribution. However, it also resulted in SELinux being the initial
scapegoat for virtually all problems. Dan Walsh was a true workhorse
in pouring through this onslaught of issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c59f40"></a>
2.6 Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Upstream, Upstream, Upstream&rdquo;&mdash;this became the
mantra among our kernel team throughout the entire
duration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4 construction.
The reason for this is that every change in which
Red Hat's kernel diverges from the upstream Linux
community kernel.org becomes a liability for the
following reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Peer review&mdash;all patches incorporated upstream undergo a rigorous peer
review process.
</p></li><li><p>
Testing&mdash;there are thousands of users worldwide from hundreds of companies
who routinely access upstream kernels.
</p></li><li><p>
Maintenance burden&mdash;the closer we are to upstream kernels, the more
efficient we can be about pulling fixes back into the maintenance
streams for shipping products.
</p></li><li><p>
Next release&mdash;getting fixes and features into upstream means that we
don't have to re-add the feature manually into future releases.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These principles are core to the value of true
community open-source development. As testament
to Red Hat's active participation in the upstream
Linux kernel community, through the course of 2.6
development more patches were accepted from Red Hat
kernel developers than from any other company. During
the past year, more than 4,100 patches
from Red Hat employees were integrated into the upstream
2.6 kernel. In contrast, other companies boast
that their offering contains the most patches on top
of the community kernel. An interesting statistic
is that currently, more than 80% of all kernel patches
originate from kernel developers employed explicitly
to do such development. The kernel has become mostly
a professional employment endeavor, not a hobbyist
project.
</p><p>
Red Hat's developers were highly active in upstream 2.6 development. Some
of the areas of involvement included:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Filesystem.
</p></li><li><p>
Virtual Memory (VM) management.
</p></li><li><p>
SELinux and other security features.
</p></li><li><p>
Networking.
</p></li><li><p>
IDE and USB.
</p></li><li><p>
Serial ATA.
</p></li><li><p>
Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
</p></li><li><p>
Graphics.
</p></li><li><p>
Hardware and driver support.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Arjan van de Ven and Dave Jones, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux v.4 kernel pool maintainers, integrated kernel
contributions from our collective internal kernel
development team.
</p><p>
They frequently rebased our trees against the latest upstream kernels as
well as integrated additional bug fixes, performance tunings, hardware
platform support and feature additions. This is truly a monumental effort
given that we simultaneously support seven different architectures (x86,
x86_64&mdash;AMD64 and Intel(r) EM64T, Itanium2, IBM Power (31- and 64-bit),
mainframe in 31- and 64-bit variants) from a single codebase.
</p><p>
Initially, it was painful for Arjan to be beating everyone over the head
to ensure that all patches were accepted upstream prior to incorporating
them into our pool. Through his vigilance, the entire team became
conditioned to working upstream first. In the short term, it involves
more effort on the part of the developer to work both internal to Red
Hat as well as upstream. However, in the long term, as described above,
the benefits are considerable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c5abf8"></a>
Storage Management</h2></div></div><p>
A large class of new Linux deployments consists of
proprietary UNIX migrations. These users represent
a set of enterprise customers who have high
expectations (a euphemism for highly demanding).
Traditional functionality gaps in Linux consist
of robust software volume management capabilities.
In response to these needs, over the course of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux v.4, Red Hat acquired a strong team
of storage-centric experts when Red Hat purchased
Sistina. In this manner, Red Hat now employs the
major upstream developers of the Logical Volume
Manager (LVM) technology.
</p><p>
Overall ease of use has been improved in the
installer, where it now enables the user to create
LVM volumes. Through the use of a graphical interface in
Disk Druid, usage of LVM is much more approachable
to the end user. Another example of ease-of-use
improvements are the capabilities to grow both LVM
volumes and ext3 filesystems that are on-line. This
obviates the need to unmount the filesystem, back up,
grow the volume, reformat the filesystem and restore
the data.
</p><p>
We also wanted to take open-source storage management to the next
level to provide a cluster filesystem. The industry trends have been
toward distributed computing among large sets of commodity computers.
Although that yields cost savings in hardware, it increases costs of
managing storage and filesystems among a distributed pool of servers.
To address this need, Red Hat has augmented the LVM layer to operate in
a clustered environment by layering a robust cluster filesystem called GFS.
</p><p>
In keeping with Red Hat's core values of being an open-source player,
the complete source code base for LVM and GFS is now freely available to
the Linux community at large. Ongoing development has rekindled industry-wide contributions. Cluster Suite is the name of the productised version
of GFS and LVM, which is layered on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c5ae08"></a>
Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
One of Red Hat's largest areas of increased investment
is in what we refer to as the desktop space. Under
the guidance of Havoc Pennington, we have formed an
extensive close-knit team of developers. The primary
mantra of the desktop team has been ease of use.
If you look closely at the new adoptions of Linux
you will see an increasing trend of usage in less
computer-savvy scenarios. Examples include kiosks,
call centers, government agencies and earlier grade-school levels.
</p><p>
The desktop team worked with our application developers to identify
the most useful application set. Although there are more than 80,000 projects
on Sourceforge.net, for example, it is impractical to include all of them
in our distribution. One of our main roles as a system integrator
is selecting and organizing the most useful applications. In v.4 we
have reorganized how the applications are listed in the menus so as to be
grouped logically by function.
</p><p>
Inside the walls of Red Hat, we take the open-source model to an extreme, where product decisions
are debated by anyone who has a nearby soapbox.
Given that everyone is a self-proclaimed authority on
&ldquo;what the users want&rdquo; and what &ldquo;usability&rdquo; means,
this provided ample fodder for highly emotionally
charged debates. This all came to a head in the
selection of the default browser. The main contenders
were Firefox and Epiphany. The on-line e-mail debates
raged on. In the end, Havoc pulled all interested
parties together for a raucous conference call to
hash things out. The result was the selection of
Firefox. Given the huge amount of attention that
Firefox has been garnering, both in the media and
practical deployments, we think we made the right choice.
</p><p>
These debates are a core part of being at Red Hat.
They become so volatile because the crew sincerely
cares about what they are doing. Most people here
feel part of something bigger than a small company.
This high level of energy, creativity and enthusiasm
found at Red Hat makes it extremely challenging to be
a manager. Sometimes it seems like I'm a referee to
a crew of prize fighters, who in addition to sparing
with each other, often share a punch to the head with
me too. Perhaps I should have strived to find a more
constructive example. It's really not combative here,
just highly stimulating and challenging. After living
in this world for 3.5 years now, I can't imagine
what its like to work at a place that would be
&ldquo;just a job&rdquo;.
</p><p>
One of the key usability technologies that our
developers (including Havoc Pennington and John
Palmieri) were involved with is D-BUS (see Resources).
D-BUS is a communication
and event mechanism that enables a range of desktop applications to
compliment each other in a coordinated manner. For example, the insertion
of a CD results in launching of a corresponding application depending on
media format type. Similarly, D-BUS is used for USB device hot plug,
for example, to initiate configuration and startup of network services
or mounting filesystems from USB pendrives.
</p><p>
Ease of use was further enhanced through the bundled collection of third-party proprietary
applications. This is done for the
convenience of the end user, so that it doesn't become an egg hunt for
them to find commonly used applications. This resulted in the bundling
of RealPlayer, Helix Player, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Citrix, Macromedia Flash
and a Java runtime environment (JRE).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b69580.0x1c5b1d0"></a>
Worldwide Development</h2></div></div><p>
In April 2004, Red Hat conducted a global company meeting in
Raleigh, North Carolina. The entire company was invited.
One of the strongest impressions I took from this meeting was how truly
worldwide Red Hat is. It seemed as though there were as many non-US team
members as US members. In addition to the US, development is conducted in
Australia, Canada, Germany, Czech Republic, UK, Japan, India and Brazil.
</p><p>
Not all development is conducted within the offices of Red Hat.
Through the worldwide legions of contributors to Fedora we invite
broader participation. We actively contribute and draw from a great
diversity of community open-source projects. Again, this substantially
broadens the circle of participation. In many ways, this inclusive
process makes Red Hat feel like a trusted steward of the community,
forming a distribution representing the best and brightest technology.
This is a privilege we do not take for granted as we know it needs to
be continuously earned every day. This makes both Red Hat Enterprise
Linux and Fedora truly distributions &ldquo;by the people, for the
people&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4 is supported in 15 different languages.
These translations are all performed as an integral part of the
development cycle. Consequently, the translation process doesn't lag the
release or introduce forks in the development trees. We have a team of
&ldquo;translation elves&rdquo; located in Australia who magically do their work
at an opposite phase of the clock from headquarters. This
results in a nearly real-time translation that tracks development changes.
Additionally, there are many contributors to Fedora who are actively
involved in internationalization activities.

Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>
There are several ways in which Red Hat has improved upon our
development methodology over the course of Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4's
construction. Interestingly, the main theme of these improvements has
been to stick to core proven Linux open-source development practices.
Although we did subscribe to these practices previously, we paid increased
focus this time around to the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Upstream&mdash;doing all our development in an open community manner.
We don't sit on our technology for competitive advantage, only to spring
it on the world as late as possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Customer/user involvement&mdash;through a combination of Fedora and
increased &ldquo;early and often&rdquo; releasing of beta versions through the
development cycle, we are able to get huge volumes of invaluable feedback
(both good and bad).
</p></li><li><p>
Partner involvement&mdash;on-site partner developers have augmented our
ability to address features, bugs and incremental testing.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoiding feature creep&mdash;putting a clamp on the introduction of

We are all extremely grateful for the steady guiding influences of
Donald Fischer who did an outstanding job as overall product manager and
release manager. He was at once a diplomat, innovator, book-keeper and
go-to guy. Hats off to &ldquo;the Donald&rdquo;.

Red Hat is truly a restless place to be. It seems that no sooner have
we shipped one release, than we are already behind on the next one.
This is due to the fact that in addition to new release development,
we also support prior releases for a seven-year interval. So, for example,
here's the list of releases concurrently in development now:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Fedora Core 4 (FC4).
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.2.1 Update 7.
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.3 Update 5.
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.4 Update 1.
</p></li><li><p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.5.
</p></li><li><p>
Numerous new technologies in prerelease
stages, targeted at various upstream and internal release delivery vehicles.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Never a dull moment, and we wouldn't have it any other way!
