The final step in this new, more secure wireless network
project includes hooking up some non-Linux clients to
the new standard.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222d3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the previous two Paranoid Penguin columns, I described how Wi-Fi
protected access (WPA) can protect wireless LANs (WLANs) from unauthorized
access and eavesdropping. I also began explaining how to use FreeRADIUS to
implement WPA on your own WLAN. So far, we covered installing FreeRADIUS,
creating a certificate authority (CA) and generating and signing digital
certificates for WPA use. This month, I show you where to put those
certificates, how to configure FreeRADIUS and how to configure your wireless
access point and clients. With this information, you should be off to a
good start in securing your WLAN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222d4a8"></a>
A Brief Review</h2></div></div><p>
In case you're new to this series of articles or simply need
some reminders about precisely what we're trying to achieve, let's
briefly review our purpose and scope. WPA adds powerful authentication
functionality to the older, cryptographically broken WEP protocol in the
form of the 802.1x protocol and its subprotocols, such as EAP, PEAP and
EAP-TLS. WPA also adds dynamic session key negotiation and automatic key
regeneration, by way of the TKIP protocol. If your wireless client software
supports WPA&mdash;that is, if it includes a WPA supplicant&mdash;and your wireless
access point supports WPA, you're two-thirds of the way there already.
But if
you want to take full advantage of 802.1x, you need a back-end RADIUS
server, which is where FreeRADIUS comes in.
</p><p>
In the example scenario I established last time, we're configuring a
FreeRADIUS server to authenticate Windows XP wireless clients connecting
to any WPA-compatible wireless access point. Our 802.1x method is
EAP-TLS. EAP-TLS, you might recall, uses the TLS protocol to authenticate
wireless supplicants (clients) and your access point to one another by
using X.509 digital certificates.
</p><p>
The tasks at hand in this column are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To install the server and CA certificates we created
last time onto our FreeRADIUS server.
</p></li><li><p>
To configure FreeRADIUS to use these certificates
with EAP-TLS to authenticate users for our access
point.
</p></li><li><p>
To configure our access point to redirect
authentication to our FreeRADIUS server.
</p></li><li><p>
To install the client and CA certificates we created
last time onto a Windows XP client and configure it
to use WPA when connecting to the WLAN.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222d978"></a>
Preparing the FreeRADIUS Server</h2></div></div><p>
In Part II of this WPA series, we created three
X.509 digital certificates: a certificate authority certificate,
called cacert.pem; one server certificate, called server_keycert.pem;
and a client certificate, called client_cert.p12. The server and client
files contain both a certificate and its private key, so each of
these must be handled carefully. The CA certificate, however, is
stored separately from its key, so you can distribute cacert.pem freely.
</p><p>
FreeRADIUS stores its configuration files in either /etc/raddb/ or
/usr/local/etc/raddb/, depending on your distribution. This directory
contains a subdirectory, certs/&mdash;this, naturally,
is where you need to copy your CA certificate and your server
certificate/key. Make sure that cacert.pem is owned by the user root
and that its permissions are set to <tt  >-r--r--r--</tt>. server_keycert.pem, on
the other hand, should be owned by the user nobody and its permissions
set to <tt  >-r--------</tt>. Listing 1 shows the long directory
listings for these two files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222db88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Ownerships and Permissions for Certificates in
raddb/certs</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
-r--r--r--  1 root   users 1294 2005-02-10 01:05 cacert.pem
-r--------  1 nobody users 1894 2005-02-10 01:00 server_keycert.pem
</pre></div><p>
As long as you're attending to file ownerships, you also should
make sure that the file /var/log/radius/radius.log
and the directory /var/run/radiusd/ are writable by
nobody. If you compiled FreeRADIUS from source, these
paths instead may be /usr/local/var/log/radius/radius.log and
/usr/local/var/run/radiusd/. Both radius.log and radiusd/ may be owned by
nobody.
</p><p>
Before we dive into FreeRADIUS' configuration files, we need to create
two files that FreeRADIUS must have in order to use TLS. The first
is a Diffie-Hellman parameters file, or dh file, which is used for
negotiating TLS session keys. To create a dh file, change your working
directory to FreeRADIUS' raddb/certs/ directory and issue this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# openssl dhparam -check -text -5 512 -out dh
</pre>
</p><p>
The second file you need is a data file that contains a random
bitstream that also is used in TLS operations. <span   class="bold"><b>Do not</b></span> simply
stick the current timestamp or any other similarly
nonrandom string into a file called random, as is
suggested in at least one WPA procedure I've seen on
the Internet. Rather, use the kernel's high-quality
random number generator. From within raddb/certs, run this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=random count=2
</pre>
</p><p>
Both of these files need to be readable by the user nobody, but they
should not be writable by anybody.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222dfa8"></a>
Configuring FreeRADIUS</h2></div></div><p>
We're finally ready to configure FreeRADIUS. You may be
intimidated when you see the long list of files in etc/raddb, but don't
be. For WPA with EAP-TLS, we need to edit only three files:
radiusd.conf, eap.conf and clients.conf.
</p><p>
In radiusd.conf, all we need to do is set the user and group accounts
that the radiusd process runs as. By default these are inherited from
whatever user starts the d&aelig;mon. If you run radiusd from a startup
script, this is root; however, you definitely do not want to
run radiusd as root. Therefore, you should set the user and group
parameters in radiusd.conf, both set to nobody, as shown in Listing 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222e108"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Two Parameters to Set in radiusd.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
user = nobody
group = nobody
</pre></div><p>
Naturally you can choose different nonprivileged user and group accounts
instead of nobody and nobody, but if you do so, you need to adjust
the ownerships and permissions on the certificate files we tweaked
earlier. Regardless, make sure your nonprivileged user's entry in
/etc/password sets the user's shell to a non-shell, such as /bin/false
or /bin/true&mdash;this account should not be usable for SSH, telnet or
similar programs. For that matter, make sure both the user and group
accounts exist
in the first place, and create them if they don't.
</p><p>
Other parameters may be set in radiusd.conf, but these really
are the only two whose default settings need to be changed. See the
radiusd.conf(5) man page or Jonathan Hassell's book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>RADIUS</em></span> for
more information.
</p><p>
The next file we need to edit is eap.conf; here's where the real
heavy lifting occurs. Listing 3 shows the lines you need to edit in
eap.conf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222e420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. Changes in eap.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

eap {
  # There are several generic EAP parameters you can
  # set here, but the important one for our purposes
  # is default_eap_type:

  default_eap_type = tls

  # Next come parameters for specific EAP types. Since
  # we're going to use EAP-TLS, the tls{} section is
  # the one we care about:

  tls {
    # The following parameters tell radiusd where to
    # find its certs and keys, plus dh &amp; random files:

    private_key_password = keYpasSphraSE_GOES_h3r3
    private_key_file = ${raddbdir}/certs/bt_keycert.pem
    certificate_file = ${raddbdir}/certs/bt_keycert.pem
    CA_file = ${raddbdir}/certs/cacert.pem
    dh_file = ${raddbdir}/certs/dh
    random_file = ${raddbdir}/certs/random
    }
  }

</pre></div><p>
In Listing 3, I've specified a server-key passphrase with the
private_key_password parameter. This actually should be empty if
you created your server certificate and key with OpenSSL's -nodes
option. Unfortunately, I told you to use this option in last month's
column, and I'm retracting that advice now: it is poor practice to
use passphrase-free X.509 keys, even when that key is stored in a
clear-text configuration file such as eap.conf. Yes, if the FreeRADIUS
server gets rooted&mdash;hacked into with root privileges&mdash;even
a passphrase-protected certificate still can be compromised, thanks
to eap.conf. But if the certificate/key file is eavesdropped in
transit&mdash;when, for example, you transfer it from your CA host
to your FreeRADIUS server&mdash;it is useless to the attacker if it's
passphrase-protected.
</p><p>
Either way, make sure that eap.conf is owned and readable only by
root and not by the unprivileged user account you configured in
radiusd.conf. This may seem paradoxical&mdash;doesn't nobody need to be
able to read configuration files? But, if you start radiusd
as root, it reads its configuration files, including radiusd.conf,
eap.conf and clients.conf, before demoting itself to nobody.
</p><p>
Finally, you need to create an entry for your access point in
clients.conf. Listing 4 shows such an entry.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222e6e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. Access Point Entry in clients.conf
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
client 10.1.2.3/32 {
      secret          = 1sUpErpASSw0rD
      shortname       = wiremonkeys_AP
}
</pre></div><p>
In Listing 4, the client statement specifies the access point's IP
address. Its secret parameter specifies a string that your access
point uses as an encryption key for all queries it sends to your
FreeRADIUS server. shortname simply is an alias for your access point to
be used in log entries and so on.
</p><p>
You now can start radiusd by using the rc.radiusd script, for
example, <tt  >rc.radiusd start</tt>. You also could restart
it with <tt  >rc.radiusd restart</tt>. If radiusd starts
without errors, you're ready to go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222e9f8"></a>
Configuring the Access Point</h2></div></div><p>
The next step is the easiest part of this entire process: configure
your wireless access point to use WPA and to point to your FreeRADIUS
server. This requires only two pieces of information, the RADIUS secret
you entered in your FreeRADIUS server's clients.conf file and the IP
address of your FreeRADIUS server.
</p><p>
How you present those two pieces of information to your access point
depends on your particular hardware and software. My own access point is
an Actiontec DSL router with WLAN functionality. From its Web interface
I clicked Setup&rarr;Advanced Setup&rarr;Wireless Settings and set
Security to WPA. I then configured it to use 802.1x rather than a
pre-shared key. I also provided it with a Server IP Address of 10.1.2.3,
my FreeRADIUS server's IP and a Secret of 1sUpErpASSw0rD, as shown in
Listing 4. I left the value for Port to its default of 1812.
</p><p>
Speaking of which, if your access point and RADIUS server are separated
by a firewall, you need to allow the access point to reach the RADIUS
server on UDP ports 1812 and 1813. Doing so also allows the RADIUS server
to send packets back from those ports.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x222ebb0"></a>
Configuring Windows XP Clients</h2></div></div><p>
And that brings us to configuring a Windows XP wireless client to use
your newly WPA-enabled access point. This being a Linux magazine, I'm
not going to describe this process in painstaking detail&mdash;for that you
can see section 4.3 of Ken Roser's HOWTO, listed in the on-line Resources. In
summary, you need to:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Run the command <tt  >mmc</tt> from Start&rarr;Run....
</p></li><li><p>
In Microsoft Management Console, select File&rarr;Add/Remove Snap-in,
add the Certificates snap-in and set it to manage certificates for
My user account and, on the next screen, only for the Local computer.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy your CA (cacert.pem) certificate to your Windows system's hard
drive, for example, to C:\cacert.pem.
</p></li><li><p>
From within MMC, expand Console Root and Certificates - Current
User and right-click on Trusted Root Certification Authorities. In
the pop-up menu, select All Tasks&rarr;Import. Tell the subsequent
wizard to import the file C:\cacert.pem and to store it in
Trusted Root Certification Authorities.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy your client certificate/key file to your Windows system, for
example, to C:\client_cert.p12.
</p></li><li><p>
From within MMC&rarr;Console Root&rarr;Certificates, expand Personal
and right-click on Certificates. In the pop-up menu, select All
Tasks&rarr;Import. Tell the subsequent wizard to import the file
C:\client_cert.p12.
</p></li><li><p>
The certificate-import wizard then prompts you for the certificate's
passphrase. In the same dialog, it offers the option to enable strong
private key protection. Unfortunately, enabling this breaks WPA,
so be sure to leave this option unchecked. Also, leave the option to
mark this key as exportable unchecked&mdash;you're better off backing up
the password-protected file you just imported rather than allowing the
imported nonprotected version to be exportable.
</p></li><li><p>
In the subsequent screen, let the wizard Automatically select the
certificate store.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Now your Windows XP system is ready to go&mdash;all that remains is
to create a wireless network profile. This, however, varies depending on
your wireless card's drivers and which Windows XP Service Pack you're
running. On my Windows XP SP1 system, using a Centrino chipset and XP's native WPA
supplicant, I created a wireless network profile specifying my WLAN's
SSID. I set Network Authentication to WPA, Data encryption to
TKIP and EAP type to Smart Card or other Certificate. Windows
automatically determined which client certificate I used&mdash;this is
because we took pains to create a client certificate that references
Windows XP's extended attributes (see my previous column).
</p><p>
After you configure your wireless network profile, your Windows system
should connect automatically to your access point and negotiate a WPA
connection. If this succeeds, Network Connections should show a status of
Authentication succeeded for your Wireless Network Connection entry.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2135580.0x2225c28"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope you've gotten this far successfully and are off to a good start
with WPA. WPA isn't perfect&mdash;the world needs WPA supplicants that
can handle passphrase-protected client certificates without storing
passphrases in clear text. But, wireless networking is, it seems,
finally headed in a secure direction.
