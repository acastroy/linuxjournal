Want to remind your Web site's users about upcoming events or
get the whole company synced on a common calendar?
Get started creating iCalendar files with Python.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1354580.0x144c3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last column, we looked at Sunbird, a standalone application from the
Mozilla Foundation for tracking calendars. As we saw, Sunbird is able
to work with calendars in the iCalendar format. These calendars may
be on the local filesystem or retrieved by HTTP from a
remote server. We also saw how easy Sunbird makes it to
use a calendar that a remote server has made available. We simply enter the
URL into a dialog box, and after waiting for Sunbird to retrieve the
iCalendar file, the new events are added to our calendar display.
</p><p>
A variety of remote calendars already exist on the Internet in
iCalendar format, and you can find and subscribe to them without too
much trouble. But doing so is helpful only if you want to subscribe to a
calendar that already exists or is available publicly. What if
your organization wants to standardize on iCalendar for exchanging
event information? How can you create and distribute iCalendar files,
such that others can keep track of the events they must attend?
</p><p>
This month, we look at the server side of iCalendar files
and create calendars designed to be retrieved by calendar applications,
such as Sunbird, within an organization.

iCalendar Files</h2></div></div><p>
If two computers are going to exchange calendars,
we obviously need to have a standard that defines
how those calendars should be formatted. The protocol
over which they are exchanged is not defined,
although both standards and daily use seem to
indicate that HTTP is the overwhelming favorite for
such transactions. The format for calendar exchange, defined in RFC 2445,
reflects its age. Whereas a new calendar format would
undoubtedly be defined to use XML, this RFC, dated
November 1998, uses a set of name-value pairs, with
some primitive nesting of elements within a hierarchy.
For example, here is the the iCalendar file that we examined last
month, when we first looked at Sunbird:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
VERSION
 :2.0
PRODID
 :-//Mozilla.org/NONSGML Mozilla Calendar V1.0//EN
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID
 :05e55cc2-1dd2-11b2-8818-f578cbb4b77d
SUMMARY
 :LJ deadline
STATUS
 :TENTATIVE
CLASS
 :PRIVATE
X-MOZILLA-ALARM-DEFAULT-LENGTH
 :0
DTSTART
 :20050211T140000
DTEND
 :20050211T150000
DTSTAMP
 :20050209T132231Z
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the file begins and ends with BEGIN:VCALENDAR and
END:VCALENDAR tags. There is some calendar-wide data at the top of
the file, VERSION and PRODID, but then the first and only event is
defined, bracketed by BEGIN:VEVENT and END:VEVENT entries. You can
imagine how a file could have many more entries than this single one.
</p><p>
iCalendar makes it possible for an event to recur at regular
intervals. You thus could have a single VEVENT entry reminding you about
the weekly Monday-afternoon meeting or reminding you to put out the trash every
Tuesday and Friday morning. Each event also has a beginning and
ending time, DTSTART and DTEND, allowing for different lengths.
</p><p>
Although it is not obvious from the above example, iCalendar also
allows us to make exceptions to recurring events. So, if your
Monday-afternoon meeting is not going to take place during a holiday
week, you can insert an EXDATE entry. The application that displays
your calendar then ignores the recurring event on that date.

Publishing iCalendar Files</h2></div></div><p>
Assuming that we already have an iCalendar file on our system, making
it available on the Web is quite easy. Listing 1 contains a simple
CGI program that I wrote in Python; it looks for an iCalendar file in
a particular directory and returns the contents of that file to the
requesting calendar application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1354580.0x144c920"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. static-calendar.py, a simple CGI program in Python to
open an iCalendar file and send it by HTTP.
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python

# Grab the CGI module
import cgi

# Log any problems that we might have
import cgitb
cgitb.enable(display=0, logdir="/tmp")

# Where is our calendar file?
calendar_directory = '/usr/local/apache2/calendars/'
calendar_file = calendar_directory + 'test.ics'

# Send a content-type header to the user's browser
print "Content-type: text/calendar\n\n"

# Send the contents of the file  to the browser
calendar_filehandle = open(calendar_file, "rb")
print calendar_filehandle.read()
calendar_filehandle.close()
</pre></div><p>
If you haven't written a CGI program in Python before, this
example should demonstrate how straightforward it is. Load the
CGI module for some basic CGI functionality. Then, load the
cgitb, for CGI traceback, module, which allows us to put debugging
information in a file, if and when a problem occurs.
</p><p>
We then send a text/calendar Content-type header.
It's probably safe to assume that most content on
the Web is sent with a Content-type of text/html
(for HTML-formatted text), text/plain (for plain-text
files), with many of types image/jpeg, image/png and
image/gif thrown in for good measure. The iCalendar
standard indicates that the appropriate Content-type
to associate with calendar files is text/calendar,
even if programs such as Sunbird are forgiving
enough to accept the text/plain format as well.
Finally, we end the program by sending the contents
of the calendar file, which we read from the local
filesystem.
</p><p>
If you have been doing Web programming for any length of time, this
example should be raising all sorts of red flags. The idea that we
would use a program to return a static file seems somewhat silly,
although this does have the slight advantage of letting us hide the
true location of the calendar file from outside users. There are
undoubtedly better ways to accomplish this, however, including the
Apache Alias directive. We could improve this program somewhat by
passing the calendar's filename as a parameter, but that still would
require that we have a set of statically generated files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1354580.0x144cbe0"></a>
Creating an iCalendar</h2></div></div><p>
The real solution, and one that makes life more interesting, is to
create the iCalendar file dynamically when the user requests it. That
is, our CGI program does not return the contents of an existing
iCalendar file; instead, it creates an iCalendar file programmatically,
returning it to the user's calendar client program.
</p><p>
At first glance, this might seem to be a simple task. After all, the
iCalendar file format appears to be straightforward, so maybe we can
code something together ourselves. But upon closer examination,
we discover that creating an iCalendar file is easier said
than done, particularly if we want to include recurring events.
</p><p>
Given the increasing popularity of the iCalendar
standard and the plethora of open-source projects,
I was surprised to discover the relative lack
of attention that iCalendar has received from the
biggest open-source programming communities. Part of
my surprise was because iCalendar has been around
for several years, is used by many companies and is
supported by many calendar programs, from Novell's
Evolution to Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook.
This combination usually is a recipe for several
different options, in several different programming
languages.
</p><p>
I first looked at Perl, whose CPAN archive is renowned for its many
modules, including many for Internet standards of various sorts.
Although several Perl modules are available that parse iCalendar files, no
up-to-date module exists for building them. Net::ICal::Libical was
going to be a wrapper around the C-language libical library but was
last released in a pre-alpha version, several years ago. Net::ICal
was part of a project called ReefKnot, which also appears to have been
abandoned.
</p><p>
Luckily, the Danish developer Max M (see the on-line Resources)
recently decided to fill this gap and wrote a Python
package that makes it easy to create an iCalendar
file. I downloaded and installed the package on
my computer without any trouble, and I found that it
is quite straightforward to create a calendar with
this package. Combined with our simple CGI program
from before, we should be able to create and publish
a calendar without any trouble.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1354580.0x144ce48"></a>
Creating a Dynamic Calendar</h2></div></div><p>
I downloaded and installed the iCalendar package from the maxm.dk
site. Unlike many modern Python packages, it doesn't install
automatically. You must copy it manually to your system's
site-packages directory, which on my Fedora Core 3 system is located at
/usr/lib/python-2.3/site-packages.
</p><p>
As you can see in Listing 2, I was able to use this newly
installed iCalendar package to create new objects of type Calendar and
Event. The first thing I had to do was import the appropriate
packages into the current namespace:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from iCalendar import Calendar, Event
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1354580.0x144d000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. dynamic-calendar.py, a program that generates a calendar
in iCalendar format.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/python

# Grab the CGI module
import cgi
from iCalendar import Calendar, Event
from datetime import datetime
from iCalendar import UTC # timezone

# Log any problems that we might have
import cgitb
cgitb.enable(display=0, logdir="/tmp")

# Send a content-type header to the user's browser
print "Content-type: text/calendar\n\n"

# Create a calendar object
cal = Calendar()

# What product created the calendar?
cal.add('prodid',
        '-//Python iCalendar 0.9.3//mxm.dk//')

# Version 2.0 corresponds to RFC 2445
cal.add('version', '2.0')

# Create one event
event = Event()
event.add('summary', 'ATF deadline')
event.add('dtstart',
          datetime(2005,3,11,8,0,0,tzinfo=UTC()))
event.add('dtend',
          datetime(2005,3,11,10,0,0,tzinfo=UTC()))
event.add('dtstamp',
          datetime(2005,3,11,0,10,0,tzinfo=UTC()))
event['uid'] = 'ATF20050311A@lerner.co.il'

# Give this very high priority!
event.add('priority', 5)

# Add the event to the calendar
cal.add_component(event)

# Ask the calendar to render itself as an iCalendar
# file, and return that file in an HTTP response!
print cal.as_string()

</pre></div><p>
The Calendar and Event modules inside of the iCalendar package
correspond to the entire iCalendar file and one event in that file,
respectively. We thus create a single instance of the Calendar
object and one Event object for each event that we might want to
create.
</p><p>
We then can create the calendar object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cal = Calendar()
cal.add('prodid',
        '-//Python iCalendar 0.9.3//mxm.dk//')
cal.add('version', '2.0')
</pre>
</p><p>
The second and third lines here, in which we invoke cal.add(), allow
us to add identifying data to our iCalendar file. The first of these
allows us to tell the client software which program generated the
iCalendar file. This is useful for debugging; if we consistently get
corrupt iCalendar files from a particular software package, we can
contact the author or publisher and report a bug. The second line,
in which we add a version identifier, indicates which version of the
iCalendar specification we are following. RFC 2445 indicates that we
should give this field a value of 2.0 if we are going to follow that
specification.
</p><p>
Now that we have created a calendar, let's create an event and give
it a summary line to be displayed in the calendar program of
anyone subscribing to this iCalendar file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
event = Event()
event.add('summary', 'ATF deadline')
</pre>
</p><p>
Every event, as we have already seen in the file we examined, has
three date/time fields associated with it: the starting date and time,
dtstart; the ending date and time, dtend; and an indication of when
this entry was added to the calendar, dtstamp. The iCalendar
standard uses a strange if useful format for its dates and times,
but the Event object knows how to work with those if we give it a
datetime object from the standard datetime Python package. So, we can
say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
event.add('dtstart',
          datetime(2005,3,11,14,0,0,tzinfo=UTC()))
event.add('dtend',
          datetime(2005,3,11,16,0,0,tzinfo=UTC()))
event.add('dtstamp',
          datetime(2005,3,11,0,10,0,tzinfo=UTC()))
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the above three lines used UTC as the time zone. When the
iCalendar file is displayed inside of a client Calendar application,
it is shown with the user's local time zone, as opposed to UTC.
</p><p>
Once we have created the event, we need to give it a unique ID. When
I say unique, I mean that the ID should be truly unique, across all
calendars and computers in the world. This sounds trickier than it
actually is. You can use a number of different strategies, including
using a combination of the creation timestamp, IP
address of the computer on which the event was created and a large
random number. I decided to create a simple UID, but if you are
creating an application to be shared across multiple computers,
you probably should think about what sort of UIDs you want to
create and then standardize on them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
event['uid'] = 'ATF20050311A@lerner.co.il'
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we must give our event a priority, in the range of 0 through
9. An event with priority 5 is considered to be normal or
average; urgent items get higher numbers and less-urgent items get
lower ones:

<pre     class="programlisting">
event.add('priority', 5)
</pre>
</p><p>
Once we have created our event, we attach it to the calendar object,
which has been waiting for us to do something with it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cal.add_component(event)
</pre>
</p><p>
If we are so interested, we then could to add more events to the
calendar. So long as each has a unique UID field, there won't be
any problems.
</p><p>
Finally, we turn our Calendar object into an iCalendar file, using the
as_string() method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
print cal.as_string()
</pre>
</p><p>
Because print writes to standard output by default, and because CGI
programs send their standard output back to the HTTP client, this has
the effect of sending an iCalendar file back to whoever made the HTTP
request. And because we have defined the MIME type to be of type
text/calendar, the HTTP client knows to interpret this as a
calendar and display it appropriately. If we look at the output
ourselves, we see that it is indeed in iCalendar format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
PRODID:-//Python iCalendar 0.9.3//mxm.dk//
VERSION:2.0
BEGIN:VEVENT
DTEND:20050311T160000Z
DTSTAMP:20050311T001000Z
DTSTART:20050311T140000Z
PRIORITY:5
SUMMARY:ATF deadline
UID:ATF20050311A@lerner.co.il
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, I must admit that this example is almost as contrived as the
previous one. True, we have exploited the fact that we can
generate a calendar dynamically, but this event was hard-coded into
the program, making it impossible for a nonprogrammer to add, modify
or delete the event. That said, we have taken an additional step
toward the programmatic calculation of events and dates. The next
step is to store the dates in a file or even in a relational
database and to use our program to convert the information on the
fly.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we looked at the creation of a dynamic calendar using the
iCalendar module for Python wrapped inside of a simple CGI program.
At the same time, we saw the limitations of having a calendar whose
entries need to be on disk. A better solution would be to put that
event information in a relational database, which has built-in support
for dates, as well as security mechanisms for user and group access.
Next month, we will extend our calendar program so that it retrieves
information from a database, turning PostgreSQL tables into iCalendar
files.
