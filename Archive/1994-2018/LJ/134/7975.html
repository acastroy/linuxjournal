E-books are a disappointing flurry of vendor-specific
formats. Get them converted to HTML to view on your choice of
device.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Books in digital format, also known as e-books, can be read
on devices lacking the power and screen space
to afford a regular Web browser. Several publishers, not to mention
projects such as Project Gutenberg, have provided thousands of new and
classic titles in digital format. The problem is both the
hardware&mdash;be it generic PDAs or dedicated devices&mdash;and the
whole e-book publishing industry are much more
fragmented than are PCs and Web browsers. Therefore,
it is probable that the e-book you recently bought will not be readable
ten years from now&mdash;nor tomorrow, should you decide to use a laptop
or change PDAs. To help combat this fragmentation, this article
discusses some existing command-line tools that can convert the most
popular e-book formats to ASCII or HTML.
</p><p>
Practically no tools exist now to export e-book formats
to PDF or OpenDocument, the new OASIS standard used
in OpenOffice.org, but this is not necessarily a big
deal. Once text is in ASCII or HTML format, it easily can
be moved to plain-text or PDF format by using a text
browser such as w3m or programs such as html2ps. If you go this route
for conversion, you are able to do it today, and because it's an open
format, 20 years from now too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x19783f8"></a>
PalmDoc</h2></div></div><p>
On PalmOS, the original and most common e-book format
is PalmDoc, also called AportisDoc or simply Doc,
even though it has nothing to do with Microsoft Word's .doc
format. Doc, recognizable by the extensions .pdb (Palm
Database) or .prc (Palm Resource Code), basically is
a PalmPilot database composed of records strung
together. This standard has spun off several variants, including
MobiPocket, which adds embedded HTML markup tags
to the basic format.
</p><p>
Each Palm e-book is divided into three sections:
the header, a series of text records and a series of
bookmark records. Normally, the header is 16 bytes
wide. Some Doc readers may extend the width at run time
to hold additional custom information. By default,
the header contains data such as the total length of the
uncompressed text, the position currently viewed
in the document and an array of two-byte unsigned
integers giving the uncompressed size of each text
record. Usually, the maximum size for this kind
of records is 4,096 bytes, and each one of them is
compressed individually.
</p><p>
The bookmark records are composed of a 16-byte name and a 4-byte offset
from the beginning of text. Because bookmarks are optional, many
Doc e-books don't contain them, and most Doc readers support
alternative&mdash;that is, non-portable&mdash;methods to specify them. Other
reader-specific extensions might include category, version numbers and
links between e-books. Almost always, this information is
stored outside the .pdb or .rc file. Therefore, you should not expect
to preserve this kind of data when converting your e-books.
</p><p>
Pyrite Publisher, formerly Doc Toolkit, is a set of content
conversion tools for the Palm platform. Currently, only some text
formats can be converted, but functionality can be extended to support
new ones by way of Python plugins. Pyrite Publisher can download the
documents to convert directly from the Web; it also can download set bookmarks
directly to the output database. The package, which requires Python
2.1 or greater, can be used from the command line or through a
wxWindows-based GUI. The software is available for Linux and Windows
in both source and binary format. Should you choose the latter option,
remember that compiled versions expect Python to be in /usr. The
Linux version can install converted files straight to the PDA using
JPilot or pilot-link.
</p><p>
Pyrite installed and ran flawlessly on Fedora Core 2. Unlike the
other command-line converters presented below, however, Pyrite can save
only in ASCII format, not in HTML. The name of the executable is pyrpub.
The exact command for converting .pdb files uses this syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">

pyrpub -P TextOutput -o don_quixote.txt \
Don_Quixote.pdb

</pre>
</p><p>
Pyrite can be enough if all you want to do is quickly index
a digital library. On the other hand, it is almost trivial to reformat
the result to make it more readable in a browser. The snippet
of Perl code in Listing 1, albeit ugly, was all it took to produce the version of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Don Quixote</em></span> shown in Figure 1.

&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
END_HTML

</p></div></div><p>
The script loads the whole ASCII text previously generated with
Publisher, and every time it finds two new lines in a row, it replaces
them with HTML paragraph markers. The result then is printed to
standard output and properly formatted as basic HTML. To change
justification, fonts and colors, you simply need to paste your
favourite stylesheet right after the
<tt  >&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;</tt> line.
</p><p>
OpenOffice.org 2.0, expected to be released in spring 2005, will be
able to save text in .pdb format. If it also is able to read such
files, its mass conversion feature (File&rarr;AutoPilot&rarr;Document
Converter) would solve the problem nicely. I have tried to do this
with the 1.9.m65 preview, but all I got was a <tt  >General input/output
error</tt> pop-up message. Hopefully, this functionality will be
added to future versions.

The P5 Perl Package</h2></div></div><p>
Pyrite Publisher is designed mainly to go from normal HTML or text
files to the Palm platform, not the other way around. The procedure
discussed above is not really scalable to scenarios such as converting a
great quantity of Palm e-books to customized HTML, with hyperlinks and
metadata included. In such cases, the best solution might be a Perl script
combining the standard XML or HTML modules for this language with the
P5-Palm bundle; these are available from the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(see the on-line Resources). The P5-Palm set of modules includes classes for reading, processing
and writing the .pdb and .prc database files used by PalmOS devices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978d40"></a>
Rocket Ebook and MobiPocket</h2></div></div><p>
RocketBook e-books have several interesting characteristics, including
support for compressed HTML files and indexes containing a summary of
paragraph formatting and the position of the anchor names. These
and many more details on .rb file internals are explained in the RB
format page listed in the on-line Resources. Rbmake Rocket Ebook and
Mobipocket files can be disassembled with a set of command-line tools
called Rbmake. Its home page offers source code, binary packages, a
mailing list and contact information to report bugs. To use rbmake,
you need libxml2, version 2.3.1 or higher; the pcre
(Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions) library; and zlib, to handle
compression. To compile from source&mdash;at least on Fedora Core
2&mdash;it also is necessary to install separately the pcre-devel
package.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x1978e48"></a>
The Rbmake Library</h2></div></div><p>
A nice feature of Rbmake is the source code is
structured in a modular manner. An entire library of
object-oriented C routines can be compiled and linked
independently from the rest of the package from any other program
dealing with .rb files. In this way, should you want to write your own
super-customized Rocket Ebook converter or simply index all of your e-books
into a database, you would need to use only the piece that actually knows how to
read and write the .rb format, the RbFile class. This chunk of
code opens the file, returns a list of the sections composing the book
and uncompresses on the fly only the ones actually required by the
main program. Should you need them, the library also includes
functions to match and replace parts of the content through
Perl-compatible regular expressions.
</p><p>
The Rbmake tools should compile quickly and without problems on any
modern GNU/Linux distribution. Exhaustive HTML documentation also
is included in the source tarball. The binary file able to
generate HTML files is called rbburst. It extracts all
the components&mdash;text, images and an info file&mdash;present in the original
.rb container. Figure 2 shows, in two separate Mozilla Windows, the
cover page and the table of contents of the file generated by
rbburst when run on <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Invisible Man</em></span> by H. G. Wells.

Microsoft Reader</h2></div></div><p>
Microsoft's Reader files, recognizable by the .lit
extension, have many of the characteristics of
traditional books, including pagination, highlighting
and notes. They also support keyword searching and
hyperlinks, but they are locked in to one reader platform.
</p><p>
The tool for converting these files is called, simply,
Convert Lit. Running the program with the -help
option lists, according to UNIX tradition, all the
available command-line options. This program
has three modes of operation: explosion,
downconversion and inscribing. Explosion is the
one needed to convert an existing .lit file to an
OEBPS-compliant package. OEBPS (Open eBook Publication
Structure) is covered later in the article.
</p><p>
Figure 3 shows a version of Shakespeare's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Midsummer's
Night Dream</em></span> obtained by using explosion from the Convert Lit
program. Downconversion is the opposite process; it generates a .lit
file for use by a Microsoft Reader-compliant
device. Inscribing is when the downconversion attaches a user-defined
label to the .lit file. The exact syntax is explained on the program's
home page (see Resources).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7975f3.large.jpg"><img src="7975f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Convert Lit creates a readable HTML file with a hyperlinked
table of contents.
</p></div></div><p>
We already mentioned that Convert Lit creates an OEBPS package made of
different files. Here is the complete list for the example above:
Contents.htm, copyright.html, ~cov0024.htm, cover.jpg,
MidSummerNightDream.opf, MobMids.html, PCcover.jpg, PCthumb.jpg,
stylesheet.css and thumb.jpg. HTML, CSS and JPG files were to be
expected, but what is the .opf file? It is an XML container describing
the structure and several portions of the original book's metadata. The
extension OPF stands for open electronic book package format. The OPF file
contains references to the other pieces of the e-book, as well as descriptions of
their attributes. To have a clearer idea of its role, a short excerpt of
MidSummerNightDream.opf is shown in Listing 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x19795d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. OPF is an XML-based format for book attributes.
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;dc:Title&gt;A Midsummer-Night's Dream&lt;/dc:Title&gt;
&lt;dc:Creator role="aut"
    file-as="Shakespeare, William, 1564-1616"&gt;
        William Shakespeare, 1564-1616
&lt;/dc:Creator&gt;
&lt;dc:Description&gt;fiction, poetry&lt;/dc:Description&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The practical consequence of this is Convert Lit could be useful even
if you wanted to leave all of your collection in a
proprietary format. You still could run the program on
all your .lit e-books and delete everything but the .opf files. Then, any
quick script or full-blown XML parsing utility could scan them and
index everything into the database of your choice.
</p><p>
Convert Lit also removes digital rights management
(DRM) infections from e-book files using the older
DRM1 version. And if you have Microsoft Reader
e-books, you likely have a Microsoft Windows system
and a licensed copy of Microsoft Reader. According
to the Convert Lit Web site, you can build and run
Convert Lit on Windows to first convert new DRM5 e-books to
DRM1, using the Windows DRM library.

Mass Conversion</h2></div></div><p>
In general, we have discussed only command-line processing in this
article. If, however, you have a whole collection of e-books in
different formats, you can convert them all at one time with a simple
shell script. As we already have shown, once the text is in ASCII or HTML
format, the sky is the limit. You can add one or two lines to the loop
to index with <tt  >glimpse</tt> or
<tt  >ht::dig</tt>, print
everything in one single PostScript book and much more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1880580.0x19799f8"></a>
OEBPS</h2></div></div><p>
A solution for putting e-books, at least the ones you will be able to get in
the near future, into an open format is in the works. It is the Open eBook Publication
Structure (OEBPS). Its goal is to provide an XML-based
specification, based on existing open standards, for providing
content to multiple e-book platforms. OEBPS,
which has reached version 1.2, is maintained by
the Open eBook Forum, a group of over 85 organizations&mdash;hardware and software companies, publishers,
authors and users&mdash;involved in electronic publishing.
OEBPS itself does not directly address DRM. However,
an OeBF Rights and Rules Working Group is
studying these issues &ldquo;to provide the electronic
publishing community with a consistent and mutually
supporting set of specifications&rdquo;. Time will tell
what will come from this.
</p><p>
In any case, the open standards on which OEBPS is built
already are well established. Besides XML, Unicode,
XHTML and selected parts of the CSS1 and CSS2
specifications are represented. Unicode is a family of encodings that
enables computers to handle without ambiguity tens
of thousands of characters. XHTML is the reformulation
of HTML 4 as XML. In a nutshell, OEBPS could be
described as nothing more than an e-book optimized
extension of XHTML&mdash;something that won't go
away when some company goes out of business. Graphics
can be in PNG or JPEG formats. Metadata, including author,
title, ISBN and so on, will be managed through the
Dublin Core vocabulary.
</p><p>
OEBPS has the potential to preserve all your e-books
and make sure that the ones you download or buy will
not vanish if any hardware or software company goes
the way of the dodo. However, DRM schemes applied
on top of these &ldquo;open&rdquo; e-books still could lock
your content in to one vendor. As long as you can
obtain OEBPS e-books without DRM, OEBPS is the best
way to guarantee that even if all current e-book hardware
disappeared, your collection would remain usable.
