How a large development project on a tight release schedule and a
tight budget can use open source to tackle the problems of version
control and release management.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13af580.0x14a7348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Say you have a large piece of software, a complicated Web site or a whole
bunch of little ones. You also have a gaggle of coders and a farm of machines
on which to deploy the end product. Worst of all, the client insists on
a short turnaround time for critical changes. Proprietary products
that may provide you with a systematic, unified development, testing
and deployment process typically are expensive and offer limited
deployment options. They often require new hardware resources and software
licenses simply to support installation of the system itself. Such a
solution can be difficult to sell to managers who are concerned about
cost and to developers who are concerned about learning a new and
complicated process.
</p><p>
However, managing the development process from
end to end on a tight schedule without such a unified approach can
lead to serious inefficiencies, schedule slippage and, in general,
big headaches. If you're the administrator of such a project, chances
are you're spending a lot of time dealing with the management of code
releases. On the other hand, you already may be using an expensive piece
of proprietary software that solves all of your problems today, but the
higher-ups are balking at the ever-increasing license renewal fees. You
need to present them with an alternative. It's also possible that you
release code only once a year and have more free time than you know
what to do with, but you happen to be an automation junkie. If any
of these scenarios seem familiar to you, read on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13af580.0x14a74a8"></a>
The Solution</h2></div></div><p>
Various open-source products can be adapted to minimize costs and developer
frustration while taming your out-of-control release process by serving
as the glue between existing toolsets. Maybe you even can start making
it home in time to play a round or two of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> before bedtime.
</p><p>
I base the examples presented in this article on a few assumptions that
hopefully are common or generic enough that the principles can be
extrapolated easily to fit with the particulars of a real environment. Our developers
probably already use a bug-tracking system (BTS), such as Bugzilla,
ClearQuest or Mantis, or an in-house database solution to track change
requests and bugs. They also may be using a version control system
(VCS), such as Arch, CVS or Subversion, to manage the actual code changes
called for in various BTS entries.
</p><p>
If they're not using a BTS and a VCS for a large project, these
developers probably have either superhuman organization skills or a high
level of tolerance for emotional trauma. Which BTS and VCS we use is not essential to
this discussion, and any exploration of the pros and cons between one
system and another requires much more text than I am allotted here. In
short, they all should support the building blocks needed for
the type of process we'd like to employ. Namely, most any BTS can:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Assign a unique ID to all issues or bugs in its database.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow you to use the unique ID to track the state of an issue and
store and retrieve a listing of any source files it effects.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Any VCS worth its salt (sorry VSS fans) can:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Allow some form of branching and merging of a central code hierarchy.
</p></li><li><p>
Allow a command-line client process to connect over a secure network
connection in order to perform updates.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
We use a Subversion (SVN) repository with the
SVN+SSH access method enabled as our VCS and a
generic MySQL database table as the BTS. We use
Python, which tends to be quite readable even for
the novice programmer, as our scripting language of
choice. Chances are your distribution has
packages for all of these products readily available;
configuring them will be left as an exercise for
the reader. The target machines are generic Web
servers, all of which support SSH connections as well as
the VCS client tools.
</p><p>
Here's the 10,000-foot overview of the example end-to-end process
we are likely to be starting out with:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
An issue is generated in the BTS and is assigned an ID of 001 and an
initial status of &ldquo;new&rdquo;. It includes, or will include, a listing of file
paths that represent new or changed files within the VCS repository and
is assigned to the appropriate developer.
</p></li><li><p>
The assignee developer makes changes to his local copy of the source
code, checks these changes into the VCS repository and updates the
status of BTS ID# 001 to &ldquo;in testing&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
The testing server is updated with the new changes.
</p></li><li><p>
A QA tester charged with reviewing all BTS items with a status of
&ldquo;in testing&rdquo; verifies that the changes to the code are what
is desired and updates the status of BTS ID 001 to &ldquo;ready for production&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
A release manager then packages all changes affected by BTS ID# 001
into a release and updates the status of BTS ID# 001 to &ldquo;in
production&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
The live server is updated with the changes.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
For the most part, we're managing to fix bugs and add new features to the
code base without bugging the system administrator for much, aside from
the occasional password reset or RAM upgrade. But steps 3 and 6 require
us somehow to get the code out of the VCS and onto a live system. We
could cut and paste files from the VCS into a folder on our hard drive,
zip it up, send it to the sysadmin and ask him to unzip it on the
live system. Or, we could take advantage of the structure of our VCS
and its utilities to do the work for us and completely avoid having a
conversation with the administrator, whose time tends to be a hot commodity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13af580.0x14a81b8"></a>
The Nuts and Bolts</h2></div></div><p>
If we structured our VCS to encompass a branching scheme that mirrors
our various statuses in the BTS, we likely would end up with a BRANCH to
which developers add new, untested changes and a TRUNK that includes
only code that is &ldquo;in production&rdquo;, although it easily could be the other
way around. It then becomes a relatively simple matter of using the
branch merging capabilities of the VCS to move &ldquo;ready for
production&rdquo; code from the testing BRANCH to the stable TRUNK.
Because no development changes happen on our TRUNK, merging from BRANCH
to TRUNK is not likely to cause any conflicts. Managing the last step
of moving the code from the VCS to the live system becomes even easier,
because updating simply is a matter of using the VCS client utility to
pull down all changes that occurred on the TRUNK of the repository.
</p><p>
So now all the pieces are there to allow quick and accurate
code deployment, but we still need to ask
our sysadmin to run the VCS client tools on the live
system. We further can minimize our demands
on the sysadmin's time, however, if he or she is willing to give
our release manager an SSH login with permission to
run the VCS client on the live system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13af580.0x14a83c8"></a>
Expanding the Model to Enable Automated Releases</h2></div></div><p>
Once we've got the infrastructure in place to support performing content
updates by way of our VCS, the next logical step is to remove further the need
for manual intervention at release time. It now is possible for us
to create a script that can use the VCS client tools to pull code updates
to a live system. This method increases its usefulness as the number
of machines we need to update increases. If our script has access to a
list of all the target machines that need to be updated, we can hit them
all in one fell swoop.
</p><p>
This piece of the puzzle, like the example, can
be a simple script that the release manager runs from the command line
of his workstation. Or, it can be a fancy Web-based GUI that a team of
release managers can use to update any number of machines from any Web
browser with a mouse click. In either case, it is useful to create
a user ID on the client machines that has permissions to connect back
to the VCS system without being prompted for login information. This
may require configuring the user account on the client machines with
SSH keys that allow it to connect back to the VCS server.

Listing 1. vcs_update.py

#!/usr/bin/env python

import os, sys

clientList = ['host1', 'host2', 'host3']
sandbox = "/usr/local/www"

def updateClient(client, sandbox):
    # ssh to client machines and update sandbox
    command_line = "ssh %s svn update %s"%(client,
                                           sandbox)
    output = os.popen4(command_line)[1].readlines()
    for line in output:
        print line

if __name__=="__main__":
    for client in clientList:
        updateCLient(client, sandbox)
</pre></div><p>
With this script in place on the client machines, we can update client
copies of VCS files from a central location over an encrypted SSH
connection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13af580.0x14a8738"></a>
Spreading the Love</h2></div></div><p>
Now we have a reasonably efficient process that piggybacks almost
seamlessly onto a process that our developers were, for the most part,
already using. It also allows content updates with the click of a
button. So what's stopping us from scripting the updates to the testing
servers so that they happen automatically at regular intervals, allowing
developers the chance to see their changes show up on a live test system without
asking for an update? All we need to do is run the client script on
the testing servers as a cron job.
</p><p>
Also, as long as we're asking crazy questions, why not take advantage of
the power of our BTS's database back end to drive the whole process and
really cut down on process management bottlenecks? To do so, our script
generates a list of files that need to be merged between branches
by running a query for all IDs with a status of &ldquo;ready for
production&rdquo;. The script uses the resulting lists as input for
functions that perform the merge commands and update the BTS ID statuses
to &ldquo;in production&rdquo; automatically.

Let's look at our amended 10,000-foot overview now that we've got all
the bells and whistles incorporated:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
An issue is generated in the BTS and assigned to the appropriate
developer.
</p></li><li><p>
The assignee developer makes changes to his local copy of the source
code, checks these changes into the TEST branch of the VCS repository
and updates the status in the BTS.
</p></li><li><p>
The testing server content is updated automatically by a cron job.
</p></li><li><p>
A QA tester verifies that the changes to the code are correct and updates the
status in the BTS.
</p></li><li><p>
A release manager presses a button to launch our merge script, which
merges all changes into the stable TRUNK and updates the BTS.
</p></li><li><p>
One last click by the release manager, and the production systems are
updated to the latest code by way of our VCS client script.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Steps 5 and 6 easily could be combined too, thereby halving the
amount of work our release manager needs to perform.
</p><p>
Chances are at some point we'll want to add a staging branch to our
VCS repository and enable our content update system to pull updates
from this intermediate branch onto a staging server. QA then could see
all the changes on a live system before the client does. Or, the client
could be given access in order to provide final approval. Once
staging has been given the thumbs up, moving updates to a production
system is as easy as performing the already automated steps of merging
from the staging branch to the stable TRUNK and running the content
update script against the production servers.
</p><p>
Although these examples represent something of an oversimplification of the
issues involved&mdash;for example, we haven't addressed the potential need for
database structure updates&mdash;we have covered some core concepts that can
be expanded on to build a truly functional, tailor-made system. In fact,
we well may be approaching development process nirvana, and we still
haven't spent dollar one on software licenses. Rather, we've simply written
a few basic scripts to glue together our bug-tracking and version control
systems. As a result, management now has more money in the reserve fund and fewer
heart palpitations. Our sysadmins have more time to devote to removing
spyware from desktops. Best of all, we've made it home for that round
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> with time to spare. That's the power of open source for you.
