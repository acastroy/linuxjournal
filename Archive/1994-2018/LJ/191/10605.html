How to implement a Nagios-to-SMS service.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0xd1b250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm a big fan of the Nagios network monitoring system and rely on it to
tell me if something goes wrong with the systems for which I am responsible.
I have made a large investment in time configuring Nagios to monitor
exactly what I am interested in, and this effort would be wasted if
Nagios detected a problem, but failed to communicate that problem to me.
To make Nagios more robust, I wanted to make sure that its alerting mechanism
did not depend on connections to the Internet&mdash;this would include the physical connection
itself and internal and external services, such as e-mail, routing and DNS.
</p><p>
I have relied on e-mail-based systems in the past to deliver alerts;
however,
my dilemma was that if I was not getting e-mail, I did not know if this
meant everything was okay or if there was some problem preventing
me from getting the e-mail alerts, such as a down Internet connection or
another kind of e-mail failure. I found that I became uneasy after long
periods of silence and felt compelled to &ldquo;poll&rdquo; the system to make sure
everything was okay.
</p><p>
On the other hand, I felt that if my alerting system was robust
and I could trust it, my thinking would become &ldquo;no news is good
news&rdquo;,
and the absence of alerts would mean everything was fine.
</p><p>
I've found that the Short Message Service
(SMS) text service available on GSM cellular networks meets my requirements
for a trusted alerting server. It is generally available and is unlikely to go down.
A major disaster certainly could take down or overwhelm the cellular service,
but I figure I would be aware of such an event and probably would have bigger and more
pressing concerns than network management at that point.
</p><p>
There are several different ways to implement a Nagios-to-SMS service,
and I certainly have not explored them all. This article describes
the system I am using, which is the MultiTech Systems MultiModem iSMS
Intelligent SMS server (Figure 1)
in combination with a public domain Perl script running on a Linux-based Nagios server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10605f1.large.jpg"><img src="10605f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MultiTech Systems MultiModem iSMS Intelligent SMS Server
</p></div></div><p>
I selected this hardware and software combination for the following
reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Another company had done all the required work to integrate the iSMS
device with Nagios, clearly documented the process and made this freely
available on the Web, including the Perl script described in
this article.
</p></li><li><p>
A major feature of the Perl script is the ability to &ldquo;ACK&rdquo; or acknowledge
a Nagios alert. This means you don't have to have any kind of IP
connection to your Nagios server to perform acknowledgements. The ability
to acknowledge alerts is helpful when you are off the IP network, as it
stops any future alerts and can prevent the alerts from going to others
if you have configured Nagios to do this. The script also can force a
service or host back to an &ldquo;OK&rdquo; state if desired.
</p></li><li><p>
The iSMS device is a standalone &ldquo;appliance&rdquo; and does not depend on any
infrastructure other than a (local) Ethernet connection, GSM cellular service
and electrical power. Most other products in this area are similar to
traditional analog modems in that they have serial connections hard-wired
to a specific host. As the iSMS is connected via Ethernet, it can be
accessed and shared by multiple hosts. The particular model I used
has a single GSM modem, but four- or eight-modem versions are also available.
</p></li><li><p>
Other Nagios users are using conventional mobile phone handsets in this
role, but I feel that consumer-level power supplies and some
kind of jury-rigged mounting of a phone in a machine room would undermine
the reliability I want. The iSMS has a robust metal case and
can be attached securely to a rack. The power plug is threaded to the
chassis to prevent accidental unplugging.
</p></li><li><p>
The iSMS has a Web-based administration interface and supports multiple
methods of communication, including a &ldquo;Telnet&rdquo; interface to connect
directly to the GSM modem for use of &ldquo;AT&rdquo; commands and multiple APIs.
These include both TCP and HTTP APIs for sending and receiving SMS
messages or querying the status of queued messages.
Certainly, you could use Web-based or e-mail-based tools to create a similar alerting
functionality, but SMS is somewhat unique in that it does not require
an IP connection and is generally available wherever a modern cellular
infrastructure exists.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As you can see in Figure 1, the iSMS is packaged in a sturdy
metal enclosure. I used large plastic wire ties to mount the
iSMS to a horizontal rack post, but it also can be mounted with screws.
The antenna is visible on the top, and there is a little hatch on the
bottom where the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card is plugged in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0xd1be58"></a>
Ordering the iSMS</h2></div></div><p>
The product is generally available, and I simply used a price comparison site
to find the cheapest one, as I didn't feel I needed support from
the vendor. MultiTech made several changes to its product while I was
in the midst of writing this article. These changes included renaming the
product, updating the firmware version and lowering the price. The iSMS
previously was named SMSFinder, and you will see this reflected in the
name of the Perl script and in other places. The firmware update required
some changes in the Perl code. The original product was priced around
$700, but it's now available in the $400 range. This article describes
the more recent version of the iSMS and Perl script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0xd1bf60"></a>
Ordering SMS Service</h2></div></div><p>
I did not shop around between the different carriers for SMS service,
as my company already had a corporate account with AT&amp;T. I initially tried to walk
into an AT&amp;T retail store to buy service for the iSMS, but I was unable
to purchase a service package that did not include voice. I ended up
doing all the ordering and setup over the phone with AT&amp;T corporate.
I was able to get the SIM card at the retail store, which saved me from
having to wait for the card to be mailed to my location. AT&amp;T calls
its text-only SMS service telemetry. It may make the ordering process
easier if you use this terminology with your carrier. 
</p><p>
Once you reach
the correct ordering department, all you should need to do is read them
two numbers: the first identifies the iSMS, and the second identifies
the SIM card. The number for the iSMS is the International Mobile
Equipment Identity (IMEI) number printed on the iSMS chassis label.
The second number, the Integrated Circuit Card ID (ICC-ID) is printed on the SIM card.
Once I had communicated these numbers to the carrier, I was able to
establish the service and send a test message within a few minutes.
Make sure you make note of the subscriber number given to you, as this
will be the source of SMS alerts and the destination for your
&ldquo;ACK&rdquo;
and &ldquo;OK&rdquo; responses. It is handy to associate a contact name with
this number for caller-ID purposes on your mobile phone (for example,
&ldquo;Nagios&rdquo;). With the service I purchased, the one-time setup fee was
$18, and the monthly charge is about $9, depending on usage.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0xd1c1c8"></a>
Physical Location of iSMS</h2></div></div><p>
I wanted the iSMS and the Nagios server to be able to send messages for
as long as possible if there were a problem with network connectivity or
power. In my situation, this meant locating the iSMS, the Nagios server
and their shared Ethernet switch all in the same computer room and plugged
in to the same redundant UPS. Of course, I could eliminate the switch
from this configuration by using an Ethernet crossover cable to 
link the iSMS and the Nagios server directly, but that would limit communication
to the one server. It also would eliminate most of the advantages
over the hard-wired GSM modems that I was trying to improve upon.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0xd1c328"></a>
The smsfinder Perl Script</h2></div></div><p>
The Perl script can be found on the MonitoringExchange site
(<a href="http://www.monitoringexchange.org" target="_self">www.monitoringexchange.org</a>) or the Nagios Wiki
(<a href="http://www.nagioswiki.org" target="_self">www.nagioswiki.org</a>).
Searching for &ldquo;smsfinder&rdquo; should get you to the correct place.
The documentation for the script includes installation instructions,
example Nagios configuration files and screenshots of the iSMS Web
user interface. The author used an interesting approach to create a
single script that serves three different purposes. The script checks
to see which filename was used to call the script and then performs
a completely different function depending on which name was used.
The script has three names:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
smssend.pl: a Nagios &ldquo;command&rdquo; used to send messages about hosts
and services via SMS.
</p></li><li><p>
smsack.cgi: a CGI script used by the iSMS to acknowledge alerts it
has received via an SMS message sent by a mobile phone.
</p></li><li><p>
check_smsfinder.pl: a typical Nagios &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; or
&ldquo;check&rdquo; script
invoked by Nagios on a scheduled basis to monitor the health of the iSMS
device itself.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0xd1c8a8"></a>
Script Installation</h2></div></div><p>
I stored the actual script as /usr/local/nagios/smsack/smsack.cgi
and made two symbolic links to it with the following names/paths:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
/usr/local/nagios/smsack/sendsms.pl
</p></li><li><p>
/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_smsfinder.pl
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Apache will want to execute an actual file as a CGI,
while Nagios will not care about the symbolic links.
Figure 2 provides an overview of how the script interacts
with the other components of the system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10605f2.large.jpg"><img src="10605f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. SMSFinder Method of Operation
</p></div></div><p>
The least complex use of the script is when it is called
check_smsfinder.pl. Nagios runs this check script at scheduled
intervals, and the script queries a status page on the iSMS via HTTP to
make sure it is running okay. The script returns the exit status back
to Nagios. The performance data includes the signal level for the GSM
modem, the model number and the firmware version.
</p><p>
The next use of the script is when it is called as sendsms.pl by Nagios.
In this form, it is used to send host and service alerts and acknowledgements to the
iSMS for delivery to mobile users. The script uses the &ldquo;HTTP Send
API&rdquo; to
request that it transmit the SMS message. The iSMS queues the request and
returns a message ID. The end user can query the iSMS with the message
ID to find out if the SMS message was sent successfully or failed for
some reason. When invoked as sendsms.pl, the script has a --noma option,
which will query the iSMS after queuing the message to get its status.
This takes slightly longer to execute, as the script has to wait for
confirmation that the message actually was sent (or failed).
The documentation refers to &ldquo;NoMa&rdquo; but does not explain why the option
was named that way.
</p><p>
The most complicated use of the script is when it runs as the smsack.cgi
CGI script under Apache. The recipient of an SMS alert can send the entire
message back to the iSMS with the string &ldquo;ACK&rdquo; or
&ldquo;OK&rdquo; prepended to
the message text. When this SMS message is received by the iSMS, it
uses the &ldquo;HTTP Receive API&rdquo; to call the smsack.cgi CGI script with
the ACK message. The smsack.cgi CGI script parses the message text,
determines whether it is a host or service being acknowledged, verifies
that the sender's phone number is in the Nagios object cache and then uses
the Nagios &ldquo;external command&rdquo; interface to signal Nagios. Nagios then
tries to match the host or service name with one it knows about, and if
this match is successful, it acknowledges the problem. The script also
creates a note on the host or service page indicating that the problem
was acknowledged by the sender's mobile number.
</p><p>
The acknowledge feature expects the entire SMS alert message to be sent
back to the iSMS with the &ldquo;ACK&rdquo; text prepended. I found the best way
to do this on both older text-based and newer graphical mobile phones was
to &ldquo;forward&rdquo; the entire message received from Nagios back to the Nagios
phone number and then insert the ACK text at the beginning of the message.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10605f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Apple iPhone Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 3 shows a screenshot from an Apple iPhone. The initial
&ldquo;PROBLEM&rdquo; alert
received from the iSMS is at the top (shown in gray). The message
forwarded back to the iSMS with the prepended &ldquo;ACK&rdquo; is in the middle
(shown in green), and the receipt of the acknowledgment sent from the iSMS is at the
bottom (shown in gray). This entire transaction can be accomplished in
less than a minute.

Debugging Installation and Runtime Problems</h2></div></div><p>
I was able to get everything running in a day or two, but I did have to
resolve several issues as part of the installation. I also discovered
several problems that required changes to the Perl script.
Therefore, it's important to test the scripts.
</p><p>
You can run the check_smsfinder.pl and sendsms.pl scripts on the
command line to view their output directly. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
% /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_smsfinder.pl \
     -H 192.168.1.50 -u nagios -p secret
OK: GSM signal strength is 100.0% - \
    model: SF100-G - \
    firmware: 1.31|loginID=1607132337 strength=100.0%;40;20;;

% /usr/local/nagios/smsack/sendsms.pl \
     --noma -H 192.168.1.50 -u nagios -p secret \
     -n 14155551212 -m 'this is a SMS from nagios'
"this%20is%20a%20SMS%20from%20nagios" to 14155551212 \
     via 192.168.1.50 send successfully. MessageID: 37
</pre>
</p><p>
The smsack.cgi script is a little harder to debug than the command-line
scripts, but the usual Apache log files access_log and error_log are
useful in that they will contain the HTTP response codes when the CGI is
invoked by the iSMS. You also can use the method described below under
&ldquo;Network Capture&rdquo; to look for problems with the CGI script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0x1115968"></a>
Logging</h2></div></div><p>
In many places within Nagios, the Perl script and the
iSMS device contain debugging information.
Knowing where those are will help you with your installation.
</p><p>
The iSMS can send helpful debugging messages to a
remote host via syslog.
The Nagios server would be an ideal destination for the messages,
as all logging can be consolidated in once place.
The remote syslog host is specified in the iSMS Web GUI.
The iSMS syslog messages use the LOG_LOCAL0 facility.
I added a <tt  >local0.*  /var/log/isms</tt> entry to my /etc/syslog.conf file
to capture all messages. The log file will record all SMS messages
sent and received by the iSMS, for example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Nov 23 09:27:59 smsgw MultiModemiSMS modem: sentlog:
    [SENT TO] : 14155551212 : [MSG] : this is a SMS from Nagios
</pre>
</p><p>
The log also contains any authentication failures. This is useful because
the check_smsfinder.pl and sendsms.pl scripts authenticate themselves
to the iSMS every time they run.
</p><p>
The iSMS has a concept of an &ldquo;Inbox&rdquo; for SMS messages received from mobile
users and an &ldquo;Outbox&rdquo; for SMS messages being sent out from the iSMS.
You can examine these boxes via the iSMS Web interface to find out whether
a message actually was received or transmitted.
</p><p>
Nagios logs to the file nagios.log, which is typically found in the
/usr/local/nagios/var directory. You can use this log to verify that
Nagios is generating an alert for a problem and that a command has been
used to send an SMS (notify-host-by-sms):


<pre     class="programlisting">
[1258664139] HOST NOTIFICATION:
    epearce-sms;mailserv2;DOWN;notify-host-by-sms;CRITICAL -
    Host Unreachable (192.168.1.250)
</pre>
</p><p>
The Nagios log also will show the results of smsack.cgi running after
getting the &ldquo;ACK&rdquo; back from a mobile user:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[1258500602] EXTERNAL COMMAND:
    ACKNOWLEDGE_HOST_PROBLEM;mailserv2;1;1;1;14155551212;
    Acknowledged by 14155551212 at 09/11/17 15:29:57
    ACK PROBLEM mailserv2&gt; is DOWN /11-17-2009 15:28:21/ CRITICAL -
    Host Unreachable(192.168.1.250)
</pre>
</p><p>
The smsfinder scripts log to smsfinder.log (also in the Nagios
var directory). This file will contain debugging information for the
sendsms.pl and smsack.cgi uses of the script. The lines containing
&ldquo;SMSsend&rdquo; show the status of sendsms.pl when it is being run by Nagios.
For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
2009/11/19 12:55:39 SMSsend:
    "PROBLEM...mailserv...is...DOWN...CRITICAL..."
    to 14155551212 via 192.168.1.250 queued successfully.
    MessageID: 14
</pre>
</p><p>
Lines containing &ldquo;SMSreceived&rdquo; and &ldquo;SMSverify&rdquo; will show the progress
in parsing any acknowledgement SMS messages received by the smsack.cgi
script:


<pre     class="programlisting">

2009/11/12 09:15:41 SMSreceived:
    username=nagios&amp;password=secret&amp;XMLDATA=
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;

      &lt;/Message&gt;
      &lt;Date&gt;09/11/12&lt;/Date&gt;
      &lt;Time&gt;09:15:36&lt;/Time&gt;
    &lt;/Message Notification&gt;

    MSG="ACK PROBLEM ... Host Unreachable (192.168.1.250)"

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0x1116308"></a>
Apache</h2></div></div><p>
I initially had multiple overlapping &ldquo;Directory&rdquo; statements in the
Nagios section of the Apache configuration file. The net effect was a
&ldquo;Permission denied&rdquo; when the CGI was being run. I figured this out by
using the method described below and by looking at the Apache access_log
and error_log files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0x11164c0"></a>
Network Capture</h2></div></div><p>
If you think there is some communication problem with the script,
you can monitor the traffic between Nagios, Apache and the iSMS by
listening on the network. I used tcpdump to capture the HTTP traffic
and see error messages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% tcpdump -v -s 0 -w /tmp/cap host 192.168.1.50
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I used the <tt  >-v</tt> option for verbose
output, the <tt  >-s 0</tt>
option to capture as much of the packet as possible and the
<tt  >-w</tt> option
to write the captured traffic to the /tmp/cap file. The &ldquo;host&rdquo; keyword
indicates that I want all traffic to and from the IP address of the iSMS
(192.168.1.50). I ran this command on the machine hosting both Nagios
and Apache, so it should see all communication between these services
and the iSMS. I then generated some SMS messages traffic by causing
Nagios to send out a &ldquo;PROBLEM&rdquo; message, which I then acknowledged via
my mobile phone. You should see the number following &ldquo;Got&rdquo; incrementing
as packets are being captured:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet),
          capture size 65535 bytes
Got 22
</pre>
</p><p>
I then interrupted the capture and converted the captured data to
plain text:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% tcpdump -A -r /tmp/cap &gt; /tmp/txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-A</tt> option writes out ASCII text, and the
<tt  >-r</tt> option reads capture
data from a file. Examining the /tmp/txt file allows you to see the
entire HTTP transaction between Nagios, the iSMS and the CGI script:


<pre     class="programlisting">

12:50:09.434851 IP nagios.46058 &gt; smsgw.http:
    P 1:266(265) ack 1 win 46
    &lt;nop,nop,timestamp 2801435752 1987587011&gt;

GET /sendmsg?user=nagios&amp;passwd=secret...text=ACKNOWLEDGEMENT...

12:50:09.501524 IP smsgw.http &gt; nagios.46058:
    P 1:29(28) ack 266 win 6432
    &lt;nop,nop,timestamp 1987587017 2801435752&gt;

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
ID: 2078

</pre>
</p><p>
In this capture, you can see that the sendsms.pl script invoked by
Nagios (hostname nagios) has sent an HTTP GET to the iSMS (hostname
smsgw) containing the Nagios &ldquo;ACKNOWLEDGEMENT&rdquo; message. The
&ldquo;ID:
2078&rdquo; response from the iSMS back to Nagios indicates that the message
has been queued for sending and that the ID for this SMS message is 2078.
You also might note that the user name and password for the iSMS
&ldquo;nagios&rdquo; account is
being sent in the clear&mdash;not perfect, but I think this is a pretty low security risk,
as this transaction is internal to the company network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc23580.0x1116d00"></a>
Firmware Version of iSMS</h2></div></div><p>
My original iSMS came with version 1.20 firmware. This worked fine with
the original Perl script, but it had a problem in that it was somewhat
&ldquo;single user&rdquo;. For example, if you happened to be logged in to the iSMS
Web user interface while the check_smsfinder.pl script ran, it would
return a bad status, and Nagios would create an alert for the device.
Upgrading to the newer firmware fixed this problem, but broke the
check_smsfinder.pl script. The Perl script has been updated, but the
version of the script now is tied to the firmware version running on
the iSMS.
</p><p>
Because this is a Perl script, it can be modified easily.
If you do not like the format of the
message being sent out by Nagios, you can change this in the Nagios
&ldquo;command&rdquo; definition&mdash;for example,
&ldquo;notify-host-by-sms&rdquo; and also change
the Perl script to parse whatever format of a message you want to send back
from your phone. The script authors have changed their message format
over time to make it easier to parse, as problems were discovered with
whitespace in service names and host alerts that would change format
depending on whether the host definition contained an IP address
(such as in the case of DHCP clients).

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I am very pleased with how this alerting service has worked out. The iSMS has been
solid since the moment I installed it, and the associated script has worked
perfectly once I tweaked my Nagios setup to match it. I have high
confidence that I will get alerts regardless of the nature of the problem.
