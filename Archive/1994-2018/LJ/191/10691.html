A look at Screw.Unit, a framework for JavaScript
testing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc76580.0xd6e358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In mid-November 2009, at a meeting of my research group in Chicago, I
proudly unveiled the most recent beta of the software I'm writing
for my PhD dissertation, a Web application (written in Ruby on Rails)
that promotes collaboration among students and scientists. I was
pretty confident the testing would not reveal too many technical
problems, in part because I had used Cucumber and rcov to ensure a
high degree of test coverage. True, my application uses some AJAX,
which means there are certain things Cucumber cannot test.
But, given how localized such functions are, and the fact that I used
and tested them myself on a day-to-day basis, how much did it matter?
</p><p>
The good news is that for the most part, the beta test went quite
well. There were a few problems to fix, and I started to come up with
a plan to get to them. What bothered me most was not that
bugs existed, but rather that the bugs were all related to
JavaScript and AJAX. In other words, the high level of test coverage
that I had achieved was good, but it was not sufficient, because it
looked only at my Ruby code and not at the equally important
JavaScript code in my application.
</p><p>
This was not the first time I had encountered issues with JavaScript
testing. A project I worked on through much of 2009 used a great
deal of JavaScript, and we tried to test it in a number of ways, none
of which were particularly satisfactory.
</p><p>
So, I was pleasantly surprised to discover I'm not the only Web
developer who has been trying to improve test coverage for Web
applications that include a great deal of JavaScript. Indeed, 
currently a number of frameworks and libraries are available for JavaScript
testing&mdash;some of which are specific to a particular JavaScript
framework, some of which are plugins for Ruby on Rails (or other Web
application frameworks) and still others that are fairly flexible
and agnostic.
</p><p>
This month, I look at Screw.Unit, a framework for JavaScript
testing I have begun to use in my own work. Even if you don't
use Screw.Unit specifically, modern Web developers constantly
must consider ways to write testable code, not only in their
server-side language of choice, but also in JavaScript. JavaScript
plays a central role in modern Web applications, and failing to test
it thoroughly can lead to unforeseen problems, as I saw myself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc76580.0xd6e6c8"></a>
Downloading and Installing Screw.Unit</h2></div></div><p>
Screw.Unit originally was written by Nick Kallen (of Pivotal Labs) and
distributed as open source on GitHub. A number of forked
versions exist, and you might need to poke around to find one that
is sufficiently mainstream and modern for your needs. I have
been using Kallen's original version and rely on it for this
article's examples. GitHub provides a number of methods for downloading
software, but the easiest is just to &ldquo;clone&rdquo; the existing Git
repository, with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone git://github.com/nkallen/screw-unit.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Inside the screw-unit directory, you will find a number of
JavaScript libraries and CSS files, all of which are there to assist
you when running JavaScript tests.
</p><p>
The basic idea of Screw.Unit is that you introduce a set of related
tests with describe() and then each individual test with it(). The
second parameter to it() is a function that invokes one or more
assertions, using the defined expect() function.
</p><p>
Thus, let's assume you have a function defined that multiplies
its parameter by 3:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function triple(i) {
    return i * 3;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You can test it in Screw.Unit with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
describe("Triple should triple", function() {
    it("returns 6 for 2", function() {
        expect(triple(2)).to(equal, 6);
    });
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the three separate levels of functions that are involved here:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >describe</tt> introduces a block of common specifications.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >it</tt> describes and introduces a single specification.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >expect</tt> executes one test for that specification.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In order to run these tests, you need to wrap the entire
describe block inside an anonymous function, passed as the first
parameter to Screw.Unit():

<pre     class="programlisting">
Screw.Unit(function() {
    describe("Triple should triple", function() {
        it("returns 6 for 2", function() {
          expect(triple(2)).to(equal, 6);
        });
    });
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you need to pull in a bunch of JavaScript libraries that not
only define Screw.Unit, but also the objects and functions on which it relies.
The final version is shown in Listing 1, triple.html. Notice that
while you are testing JavaScript, Screw.Unit assumes you are doing
so within an HTML file. That allows you not only to load an
(unfortunately long) list of JavaScript libraries, but also the CSS
file that is used within Screw.Unit to display test results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc76580.0xd6ef60"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. triple.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/jquery-1.2.6.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/jquery.fn.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/jquery.print.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.builder.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.matchers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.events.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.behaviors.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/screw.css"&gt;

&lt;!-- Here is the function we define, to test --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     function triple(i) {
       return i * 3;
     }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Here is the test itself --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     Screw.Unit(function() {
       describe("Triple should triple", function() {
         it("returns 6 for 2", function() {
           expect(triple(2)).to(equal, 6);
         });
       });
     });
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The test is passed when Screw.Unit() is executed. If it works well,
the body of the HTML document is modified accordingly, using CSS
classes (defined in screw.css) that give the traditional green (for
passing) or red (for failing) report on the tests you performed.
</p><p>
I'm going to add two more tests, one that I know will pass, which
uses the not_equal test modifier. The other test will fail, so you can
examine what it looks like when one does. If all goes
well, you should see two green bars and one reddish-brown bar, the
last of which indicates failure. The test itself looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     Screw.Unit(function() {

       describe("Triple should triple", function() {
         it("returns 6 for 2", function() {
           expect(triple(2)).to(equal, 6);
         });

         it("does not return 100 for 2", function() {
           expect(triple(2)).to_not(equal, 100);
         });

         it("does return 100 for 2 -- fail!", function() {
           expect(triple(2)).to(equal, 100);
         });
       });
     });
&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, you can include as many it statements inside a
describe block as you need. Over time, you will see your spec grow to contain
more and more descriptions, it statements and expect statements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc76580.0xd6f328"></a>
Checking the DOM</h2></div></div><p>
Testing JavaScript functions is certainly a good thing to do.
However, one of the primary uses of JavaScript is to modify the DOM&mdash;the document object model that provides a handle onto the
contents of an HTML page. Using the DOM, you can view or modify the
page, both in its tags and in its content.
</p><p>
Thus, DOM manipulations are a primary target for JavaScript tests. You
want to be able to say that when a particular piece of HTML is clicked
on, another piece of HTML should appear.
</p><p>
Now, some of the documentation for Screw.Unit will tell you that you
can (and should) use a click() method to simulate clicking on an
element of your page. I not only found the click() method to be
unreliable, but also was persuaded by a posting on the Screw.Unit mailing
list to put my text-hiding code in a separate function, which can then
be called from within the click() handler for the paragraph and also
from the test within an it block. This not only worked, but
also encouraged a style that is more readable and easily workable, in my
opinion.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc76580.0xd6f590"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. clickview.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/jquery-1.2.6.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/jquery.fn.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/jquery.print.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.builder.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.matchers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.events.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="lib/screw.behaviors.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="lib/screw.css"&gt;

&lt;!-- Here is the function we define, to test --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
       function hide_paragraph() {
               $("#hideme").hide();
       }

       $(document).ready(function() {
           $('#hideme').click(function() {
               hide_paragraph();
           });
       });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- Here is the test itself --&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     Screw.Unit(function() {

       describe("Paragraph", function() {

         it("should be hidden when clicked", function() {
           hide_paragraph();
           expect($('#hideme').is(':hidden')).to(equal, true);

         });
       });
     });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p id="hideme"&gt;Click to hide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The full file, clickview.html, is in Listing 2. The idea is that the
document contains a paragraph:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p id="hideme"&gt;Click to hide&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You then attach a click() event handler to the paragraph, invoking a
function when the paragraph is clicked on:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function hide_paragraph() {
        $("#hideme").hide();
}

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#hideme').click(function() {
        hide_paragraph();
    });
});
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you set up a Screw.Unit() test block, as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Screw.Unit(function() {

  describe("Paragraph", function() {

    it("should be hidden when clicked", function() {
      hide_paragraph();
      expect($('#hideme').is(':hidden')).to(equal, true);

    });
  });
});
</pre>
</p><p>
When you load the page, Screw.Unit first invokes the function
hide_paragraph(), which has the same effect that clicking on it would
have. Then it checks to make sure, using a pseudo-class
(:hidden) to identify hidden text. If no text with the ID
&ldquo;hideme&rdquo; is
currently hidden, jQuery returns an empty list, and the assertion
fails.
</p><p>
The fact that everything in Screw.Unit, as in jQuery, is done using
CSS selectors makes it easy and fast to work with. It would seem that
there are people doing TDD (test-driven development) and BDD
(behavior-driven development) using Screw.Unit; although I don't count
myself among those, I do see myself using this sort of testing in the
future, if only to avoid egg on my face among my software users.
Besides, testing JavaScript in this way, at least to my mind, gives me
a feeling of working on serious software, rather than one or more
basic hacks.
</p><p>
I should note that the style in which I presented Screw.Unit in this
column is a concise, but not idiomatic way that most users will put it
into practice. Screw.Unit users typically separate tests into
multiple files, allowing them not only to define custom test matchers,
but also to have an entire library of tests, rather than just one
file. Once you get started with Screw.Unit, I'm sure you will
find a style that suits your needs, without running too much against
the grain of the system's expected use.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Screw.Unit is an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use framework for testing
your JavaScript code. It is not the only test system of its kind, but
the fact that its syntax is reminiscent of RSpec makes it easier for
people like me, who like and use RSpec, to start using it quickly.
RSpec advocates also will want me to point out that Screw.Unit offers
JavaScript developers the same sort of BDD that characterizes RSpec and Cucumber, focusing on the
results that the user sees, rather than the internal
workings.
</p><p>
If you have never tested your JavaScript before, there's no time like
the present to begin! If nothing else, you want to be sure that
clicking on various parts of your HTML page does not lead to errors.
