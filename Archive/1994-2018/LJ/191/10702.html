Opera Mobile</h2></div></div><p>
While the Opera Web browser has yet to conquer our readers' PCs,
the browser maker appears to have had more success on mobile devices.
Case in point is Opera Mobile, now in version 10, the cross-platform UI
framework for Android, BREW, Windows Mobile and Symbian/S60 smartphones.
Opera says that Mobile 10's raison d'&ecirc;tre is to open up the Opera browser
experience to more people, on more devices, allowing &ldquo;operators and
OEMs to implement the same user experience quickly and cost effectively
across their entire range of handsets&rdquo;. Other features include a
rich Web 2.0 experience optimized for mobile phones, Opera Turbo data
compression technology and the Opera Widgets standalone mini-Web apps.

Mandriva InstantOn</h2></div></div><p>
Following on the success of DeviceVM's Splashtop application, Mandriva
has introduced InstantOn, a Linux-based application that brings up a
usable interface on virtually any PC in a matter of seconds. Designed
to complement a base operating system (Linux or Windows), InstantOn
offers a choice of applications for near instant display&mdash;that is, less
than ten seconds and even less than that for hard drives with Flash memory.
Applications include Firefox, Rhythmbox, Pidgin, Skype and Thunderbird.
An OEM version will offer a customizable interface and 20,000 applications
from which to choose.

Kevlin Henney's <span   class="emphasis"><em>97 Things Every Programmer Should Know</em></span> (O'Reilly)</h2></div></div><p>
Editor Kevlin Henney has distilled essential wisdom from the programming
craft into one concise O'Reilly volume, titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>97 Things Every Programmer
Should Know: Collective Wisdom from the Experts</em></span>. The book contains 97
&ldquo;short and extremely useful programming tips&rdquo; from some of the most
experienced and respected practitioners in the industry, including Uncle
Bob Martin, Scott Meyers, Dan North, Linda Rising, Udi Dahan, Neal Ford
and many others. These veterans encourage programmers to push their
craft forward by learning new languages, looking at problems in new ways,
following specific practices, taking responsibility for their work and
becoming as good as possible at the entire art and science of programming.
The focus is on practical principles that apply to projects of all
types. One can read the book end to end or browse it to find topics of
particular interest.

Randall Hyde's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Assembly Language</em></span>, 2nd
Edition (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Now in its second edition, Randall Hyde's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Assembly
Language</em></span> from
No Starch Press has been updated thoroughly to reflect recent changes to
the High Level Assembler (HLA) language, the book's primary teaching tool.
The comprehensive, 800-page guide teaches programmers how to understand
assembly language and how to use it to write powerful, efficient code.
It further demonstrates how to leverage one's knowledge of high-level
programming languages to make it easier to grasp basic assembly
concepts quickly. All code from the book is portable to the Linux, Mac OS X,
FreeBSD and Windows operating systems.

Google Chrome for Linux and Mac OS</h2></div></div><p>
If you read our interview several months ago with the Google Chrome
team (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, October 2009), you know that the Linux and Mac
editions of Google Chrome were on their way. Well, now they've arrived,
are in beta (quite stable by Google's standards) and even offer a range
of more than 300 extensions (more advanced on Linux and Windows than Mac).
Chrome is built for speed and simplicity and is intended to leapfrog
other browsers that were built before the age of rich and complex Web
apps. The key innovation on all platforms is the V8 JavaScript engine.
Critical elements of the Linux variant are tight integration with native
GTK themes and updates that are managed via the standard system package
manager. It is reported that the Linux version came along faster than
expected due to the yammering of Google's engineers, most of whom
run&mdash;of course&mdash;Linux.

Black Duck Software's Enterprise Code Search Initiative</h2></div></div><p>
Continuing on its mission to improve open-source-based software
development, Black Duck Software recently released several new elements
in its Enterprise Code Search Initiative. The code search initiative
involves three phases: expansion of open-source code available at
Koders.com, release of Black Duck Code Sight Enterprise Edition and Free
Edition for enterprise code search and an open integration framework
initiative for community expansion of integrations with source code
management systems. Koders.com is Black Duck's free code search Web
site that has been expanded to access more than 2.5 billion lines of open-source code. Black Duck Code Sight is a tool offering enterprise-level
code search capability that can index and make software searchable
across multiple source code repositories for local or geographically
distributed development teams. Finally, the open integration framework
offers built-in integration for IBM Rational ClearCase, Subversion,
Git, Microsoft Team Foundation Server and other code management systems.

Gluster Storage Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The new Gluster Storage Platform combines the GlusterFS filesystem with
a new user interface and operating system layer for massively increased
performance and improved ease of use. Gluster says that its product allows
one to &ldquo;deploy petabyte-scale storage on industry-standard hardware in
just 15 minutes with centralized management and automated
maintenance&rdquo;.
It works by clustering together storage building blocks, aggregating disk
and memory resources and managing data in a single unified namespace.
Advantages include low storage cost, high scalability, no bottlenecks
(thanks to the lack of a metadata server) and virtual storage for virtual servers.
