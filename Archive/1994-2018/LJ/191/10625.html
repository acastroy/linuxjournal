Put your servers in the cloud with Amazon EC2 and Ubuntu.

Cloud services are all the rage today, although some of my fellow
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> staffers may scoff when they hear me say that. Cloud services is a
nebulous term that can mean anything from completely hosted services (like
Gmail) to virtualized, leased servers, such as those provided by Amazon's EC2
service. And, the latter is the subject of this article. Recently,
with the advent of Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala), Canonical has added support for
pre-baked Amazon EC2 images. This makes spinning up your own personal
cloud servers fast and easy&mdash;although not necessarily economical (see
the Amazon EC2 Economics sidebar for a quick cost breakdown of EC2).
</p><p>
The Ubuntu EC2 Starters Guide (see Resources) should be your first
stop. This document guides you through the process of creating your
own EC2 instance. Before you can do anything at all with EC2, you need
to set up an Amazon EC2 account. Go to the URL listed in the Resources section,
and either sign in with your existing Amazon account or create a new
one. Then, click on the EC2 link and sign up for the EC2 service. You
need to provide a credit card for billing purposes. Once you've done
that, select the Create an X.509 Certificate link that's presented
on the thank-you page. Select yes to create a new certificate, and then
download your certificate and private key to your hard disk. Finally,
make a note of your AWS account ID number, as you may need it later.
</p><p>
Now that you've got your Amazon account and are enrolled in the EC2
program, it's time to start installing the management tools on your
local system. If you're running Ubuntu, simply type <tt  >sudo apt-get
install ec2-api-tools</tt> to download the EC2 management tools.
You also need the Sun 1.6 JDK (installable via <tt  >sudo apt-get
install sun-java6-jdk</tt>). If you're using another distro or Mac
OS X, you can get the toolset by following the
link in the Resources section of this article. The
tools are nothing more than a .zip file full of Java binaries and shell
scripts, so they're fairly portable.
</p><p>
Now that you've got the tools, the next step is to edit your environment
variables. Simply adding the following lines to your ~/.bashrc file
will do the trick (make sure to edit the path and filename to suit your
own setup):


<pre     class="programlisting">

export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=$HOME/&lt;path-to-your-private-key&gt;/pk-XX.pem
export EC2_CERT=$HOME/&lt;path-to-your-certificate&gt;/cert-XX.pem
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre

</pre>
</p><p>
To test the tools, run the following from a new terminal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ec2-describe-images -o self -o amazon
</pre>
</p><p>
You should receive a list of all the publicly available
EC2 images published by Amazon.
</p><p>
Because the Ubuntu EC2 images are publicly available, you need to
generate an SSH key to access them. Do this on your local machine
by running the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ec2-add-keypair ec2-keypair &gt; ec2-keypair.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
Make sure the permissions on the file are read-write for your user,
with no access for anyone else (<tt  >chmod 600
ec2-keypair.pem</tt>).
</p><p>
Now that you've finished the groundwork, you're ready to start up your
first Ubuntu 9.10 instance in the cloud. The
<tt  >ec2-run-instances</tt> command
will start your instance for you, but you need to feed it an AMI ID and
your keypair. The AMI ID is nothing more than a unique identifier that
is associated with a published EC2 image. Because I want to instantiate the
&ldquo;small&rdquo; Ubuntu 9.10 EC2 image for this example, I use the
&ldquo;ami-52be5d3b&rdquo; AMI ID. The links to
publicly available Ubuntu 9.10 images and their AMI IDs are available in
the Resources section of this article. Once you run the
<tt  >ec2-run-instances</tt> command,
you will see output similar to the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ec2-run-instances ami-ab15f6c2 \
                    --key ec2-keypair --instance-type m1.small
RESERVATION  r-d8b376b0  748502897232  default
INSTANCE     i-bc9913d4  ami-ab15f6c2 \
                 pending     ec2-keypair  0 \
                 m1.small    2009-11-02T22:23:12+0000 \
                 us-east-1d  aki-76be5d1f  ari-4cbe5d25
</pre>
</p><p>
Instances may take a few minutes to start up (shown by the
&ldquo;pending&rdquo;
status in the output above), particularly if this is your first
one. To check on the status of your instance, you can run the
<tt  >ec2-describe-instances</tt> command. When your instance is running, you'll
see something similar to the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ec2-describe-instances
RESERVATION  r-d8b376b0  748502897232  default
INSTANCE     i-bc9913d4  ami-ab15f6c2 \
                 ec2-72-44-62-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com \
                 domU-12-31-39-00-ED-A3.compute-1.internal \
                 running     ec2-keypair  0 \
                 m1.small    2009-11-02T22:23:12+0000 \
                 us-east-1d  aki-76be5d1f    ari-4cbe5d25
</pre>
</p><p>
The &ldquo;running&rdquo; tag in the output denotes that the instance is up and
running. Also listed is the Internet-facing DNS name as well as the
internally facing Amazon DNS name. The default image has SSH running,
but the EC2 firewall rules deny inbound port 22 access. To enable SSH
access to the EC2 instance, you need to run <tt  >ec2-authorize default
-p 22</tt>. Once that is done, you can <tt  >ssh</tt> to your instance using the SSH
keys generated earlier:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ec2-authorize default -p 22
GROUP       default
PERMISSION  default  ALLOWS  tcp  22  22  FROM  CIDR  0.0.0.0/0

$ ssh -i ~/.ec2/ec2-keypair.pem \
         ubuntu@ec2-72-44-62-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Linux domU-12-31-39-00-ED-A3 2.6.31-300-ec2 #3-Ubuntu SMP \

At this point, your instance is ready for you to start configuring
whatever software you choose to run on it. Because it's essentially an Ubuntu machine,
administration and package management is done just like on the
systems you're used to (assuming you use Ubuntu). You simply can use apt-get! 
</p><p>
As an example, I'm
going to get a quick Apache server running. First, I update
the apt indexes on the instance by running <tt  >sudo apt-get
update</tt>. Next,
I install Apache on the instance by running <tt  >sudo apt-get install
apache2</tt>. Apache is installed and running using the default Ubuntu
configuration. However, I can't actually hit the Web server from my
desktop here, as port 80 and 443 are disallowed by the EC2 firewall.
I do a quick <tt  >ec2-authorize default -p 80</tt>, and now Firefox on my local machine
can hit the Web server I just installed on the EC2 instance, as shown in
Figure 1. It's not the most exciting of Web pages, but it's something!

Last but not least, you'll want to terminate or shut down your instances
when they're not in use to save money. That's done via the
<tt  >ec2-terminate-instances</tt> command. Simply run it with the ID number of
your instance (which can be determined via the
<tt  >ec2-describe-instances</tt>
command), and your instance will terminate:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ec2-describe-instances
RESERVATION  r-d8b376b0  748502897232  default
INSTANCE     i-bc9913d4  ami-52be5d3b \
                 ec2-72-44-62-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com \
                 domU-12-31-39-00-ED-A3.compute-1.internal \
                 running     ec2-keypair  0 \
                 m1.small    2009-11-02T22:23:12+0000 \
                 us-east-1d  aki-76be5d1f  ari-4cbe5d25

$ ec2-terminate-instances i-bc9913d4
INSTANCE        i-bc9913d4      running shutting-down
</pre>
</p><p>
There you have it. You can run your own servers &ldquo;in the cloud&rdquo;, thanks
to Canonical and Amazon. It's certainly a lot faster than installing your
own OS, and it requires no physical equipment nor the need to buy anything.
EC2
instances can be a great way to extend your own computing platform,
provide capacity on demand to a service or enable you to spin up
a replacement server. Whatever you use EC2 for, keep in mind the hourly
rate, or you run the risk of getting an unexpected bill at the end of
the month.

Amazon EC2 Economics</b></p><p>
Amazon's servers are priced on an hourly basis, for every hour the
instance is running. The baseline server, otherwise known as the
&ldquo;small&rdquo; configuration, is basically a Xen virtual machine with 1.7GB of
RAM, one core of CPU measuring one EC2 unit (approximately a 1.7GHz CPU) and
160GB of storage. The &ldquo;large&rdquo; configuration is 7.5GB of RAM,
two cores
with two EC2 units each and 850GB of storage. The small instance is
$0.085 per hour, and the large instance is $0.34 per hour. Amazon also
charges for data sent and received. Incoming data is billed at $0.10
per GB, and outgoing data is billed at $0.17 per GB. Larger
plans are available for more compute-intensive applications, but the cost
for those is even higher. This means that the average small instance
probably will run around $70 per month to operate, and the large
instance will run somewhere around $250 per month. Of course, this also
depends on the amount of bandwidth consumed. Although the monthly costs are a
little on the pricey side, there are no setup fees, equipment maintenance
costs or capital expenses needed to run this solution. EC2 isn't a
one-size-fits-all solution, but it may make sense for some applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f49580.0x2042900"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
How Can I Figure My Costs, Exactly?</b></p><p>
It's rather tough to nail down cost for an EC2 instance, as it
depends on things like bandwidth. However, there is a small dashboard-like application you can install that can help you track your costs. The
package byobu (formerly known as screen-profiles) can help. After
apt-getting byobu and running byobu, you'll get a screen session with
a small two-line dashboard at the bottom of your terminal window. To
add the EC2 information, press the F9 key to bring up the byobu menu,
select Toggle Status Notifications, then select the ec2_cost
notifier, and press Apply. Then you'll have a neat little running total of
the approximate cost for your EC2 instance, as shown in Figure 2. You can
see this particular run cost me 40 cents! Byobu has all kinds of other
useful little widgets too; check it out if you do a lot of management
via a terminal.
