Build a simple, secure VPN connection now!

Last month, I began a new series on how to build a Linux-based Virtual
Private Network (VPN) solution using OpenVPN. I described what VPNs are,
what they're used for, and I listed some popular ways of building VPNs
with Linux. That column ended with some pointers for obtaining
and installing OpenVPN.
</p><p>
This month, I continue with detailed instructions on how to build a quick-and-dirty single-user VPN connection that allows you to connect securely
from some untrusted remote site, like a coffee shop wireless hotspot,
back to your home network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb63580.0xc5b670"></a>
Quick Review</h2></div></div><p>
If you missed last month's column, here's a two-paragraph primer on
VPNs. First, they're generally used for two things: connecting different
networks together over the Internet and connecting mobile/remote
users to some corporate or home network from over the Internet. In the
first case, a VPN connection is usually &ldquo;nailed&rdquo;&mdash;that is, it stays
up regardless of whether individual users actually are sending traffic
over it. In the latter case, end users each create their own tunnels,
bringing them up only as needed.
</p><p>
Several protocols are in common use for VPNs. The two most important
of which are probably IPsec and SSL. IPsec is nearly always used to
create an &ldquo;encrypted route&rdquo; between two networks or between one system
and a network. In contrast, SSL, whether in the context of SSL-VPN
(which uses a Web browser as client software) or in other SSL-based
VPNs (like OpenVPN), can be used either to tunnel specific applications
or entire network streams.
</p><p>
IPsec and SSL-VPN are out of the scope of this series of articles,
which mainly concern OpenVPN. However, I will cover at least two
different remote-access usage scenarios: single-user and multiuser. A
later installment in this series may include site-to-site VPNs, which actually
are simpler than remote-access solutions and which use a lot of the same
building blocks. If I don't cover site-to-site VPNs, or if you need
to build one sooner than I get around to it here, you'll have little
trouble figuring it out yourself even after just this month's column!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb63580.0xc5b8d8"></a>
The Scenario</h2></div></div><p>
Let's get busy with a simple scenario: setting up a single tunnel to
reach your home network from the local coffee shop (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10693f1.large.jpg"><img src="10693f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Remote-Access Scenario
</p></div></div><p>
In this simple example, a laptop is connected to a wireless
hotspot in a coffee shop (Coffee Shop WLAN), which in turn is connected
to the Internet. The laptop has an OpenVPN established with a server on
the home network; all traffic between the laptop and the home network
is sent through the encrypted OpenVPN tunnel.
</p><p>
What, you may wonder, is the difference between the hardware and software
comprising the OpenVPN &ldquo;server&rdquo; versus that of the
&ldquo;client&rdquo;? As it
happens, the command <tt  >openvpn</tt> can serve as either a
server d&aelig;mon or
client d&aelig;mon, depending on how you configure and run it. What hardware
you run it on is totally up to you, although obviously if you're going
to terminate more than a few tunnels on one server, you'll want an
appropriately powerful hardware platform.
</p><p>
In fact, if you need to support a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of concurrent tunnels, you
may want to equip your server with one of the crypto-accelerator hardware
cards (&ldquo;engines&rdquo;) supported by OpenSSL (on which OpenVPN depends for
its cryptographic functions). To see which are supported by your local
OpenSSL installation, issue the command <tt  >openvpn
--show-engines</tt>. See
the documentation at <a href="http://www.openssl.org" target="_self">www.openssl.org</a> for more information on its
support for crypto engines.
</p><p>
For this simple example scenario, let's assume both client and server
systems are generic laptop or desktop PCs running current versions of some
flavor of Linux with their respective distributions' standard OpenVPN and
OpenSSL packages. The example OpenVPN configurations I'm about to walk
through, however, should work with little if any tweaking on any of
OpenVPN's supported platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X and so forth.
</p><p>
Although this scenario implies a single user connecting back to the
home server, the configurations I'm about to describe can just
as easily support many users by changing only one server-side setting
(max-clients) and by generating additional client certificates. Have I
mentioned certificates yet? You'll need to create a Certificate Authority
(CA) key, server certificate and at least one client certificate. But
have no fear, OpenVPN includes scripts that make it quick and easy to
create a homegrown Public Key Infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb63580.0xc5c010"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What about Static Keys?</b></p><p>
Conspicuously absent from my OpenVPN examples are static keys
(also known as pre-shared secret keys), which provide a method for
authenticating OpenVPN tunnels that is, arguably, simpler to use than
the RSA certificates described herein. Why?
</p><p>
An OpenVPN shared secret takes the form of a small file containing
cryptographically generated random data that is highly, highly infeasible
for an external attacker to guess via some sort of dictionary or
brute-force attack. However, unlike WPA or IPsec shared secrets, an
OpenVPN shared secret is used as a de facto session encryption key
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> instance of every tunnel that uses it; it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
used to generate other, temporary, session keys that change over time.
</p><p>
For this reason, if attackers were to collect encrypted OpenVPN packets
from, say, four different OpenVPN sessions between the same two endpoints
and were to later somehow obtain a copy of that tunnel's shared secret
file, they would be able to decrypt <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> packets
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>all
four</em></span> captured sessions.
</p><p>
In contrast, if you instead authenticate your OpenVPN tunnel with RSA
certificates, OpenVPN uses the certificates dynamically to re-key the
tunnel periodically&mdash;not just every time the tunnel is established,
but even during the course of a single tunnel session. Furthermore, even
if attackers somehow obtain <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> RSA certificates and keys used
to key that tunnel, they can't easily decrypt <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> prior captured
OpenVPN session (which would involve reconstructing the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> 
key negotiation process for <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> session key used in a given
session), although they easily can initiate new sessions themselves.
</p><p>
So in summary, although it is a modest hassle to set up a 
CA and generate RSA certificates, in my opinion, using
RSA certificates provides an increase in security that is much more
significant than the simplicity of using shared secrets.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb63580.0xc5c698"></a>
Configuring the Server</h2></div></div><p>
Let's get to work configuring the server. Here, I explain how to create a configuration
file that puts OpenVPN into &ldquo;server&rdquo; mode, authenticates a single client
by checking its RSA certificate for a valid CA
signature, transparently generates dynamic session keys, establishes the
tunnel, and then pushes settings back to the client that give the client
a route back to the home network. And, let's even force the client to use the
tunnel (and therefore the home network) as its default route back to
the outside world, which is a potent protection against DNS spoofing
and other attacks you otherwise might be vulnerable to when using an
untrusted network.
</p><p>
Configuring OpenVPN consists of creating a configuration file for each
OpenVPN listener you want to run and creating any additional files
(certificates and so forth) referenced by that file. Prior to OpenVPN
2.0, you needed one listener per tunnel. If ten people needed to connect
to your OpenVPN server concurrently, they'd each connect to a different
UDP or TCP port on the server.
</p><p>
OpenVPN as of version 2.0, however, is multithreaded, and running in
&ldquo;server&rdquo; mode, multiple clients can connect to the same TCP or UDP
port using the same tunnel profile (that is, you can't have some users
authenticate via TLS certificates and other users authenticate via shared
secret on the same port). You still need to designate different ports
for different tunnel configurations.
</p><p>
Even though the example scenario involves only one client, which would be
amply served by a &ldquo;peer-to-peer&rdquo; OpenVPN tunnel, it really isn't any
more complicated to use a &ldquo;server mode&rdquo; tunnel instead (that, again,
you can use to serve multiple clients after changing only one line). As
far as I can tell, using server mode for a single user doesn't seem to
have any noticeable performance cost either. In my testing, even the
relatively computationally intensive RSA public key routines involved
in establishing my tunnels completed very rapidly.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows a tunnel configuration file, server.ovpn, for our home
network's OpenVPN server.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb63580.0xc5cab8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
Let's walk through Listing 1's settings. <tt  >port</tt> obviously designates
this listener's port number. In this case, it's OpenVPN's default of
1194. <tt  >proto</tt> specifies that this tunnel will use fast, connectionless
UDP packets rather than slower but more reliable TCP packets (the other
allowable value being <tt  >tcp</tt>). Note that OpenVPN uses information in
its UDP data payloads to maintain tunnel state. Even though UDP is by
definition a &ldquo;stateless&rdquo; protocol, the OpenVPN process on either end of
an OpenVPN UDP tunnel can detect dropped packets and request the other
side to retransmit them.
</p><p>
<tt  >dev</tt> sets the listener to use the Linux kernel's /dev/tun
(<tt  >tun</tt>) special
device rather than /dev/tap (which would be specified by
<tt  >tap</tt>). Whereas
the tap device is used to encapsulate entire Ethernet frames, the tun
device encapsulates only IPv4 or IPv6 packets. In other words, the tap
device tunnels all network traffic regardless of protocol (IPX/SPX,
Appletalk, Netbios, IP). For this example, let's stick to the tun device;
this will be an IP-only tunnel.
</p><p>
Next, there is the RSA certificate information: <tt  >ca</tt>,
<tt  >cert</tt> and <tt  >key</tt>, which
specify the respective paths of a CA certificate, the
server's certificate and the server's private key. The CA certificate is
used to validate client certificates. If the certificate presented by a
client contains a valid signature corresponding to the CA certificate,
tunnel authentication succeeds. The server key is used during this
authentication transaction and also, subsequently, during key negotiation
transactions.
</p><p>
Note that certificate files are public information and as such don't need
highly restrictive file permissions, but key files must be kept secret
and should be root-readable only. Never transmit any key file over any
untrusted channel! Note also that all paths in this configuration file
are relative to the configuration file itself. If the file resides in
/etc/openvpn, then the ca path 2.0/keys/ca.cert actually expands to
/etc/openvpn/2.0/keys/ca.cert.
</p><p>
<tt  >dh</tt> specifies a file containing seed data for the Diffie-Hellman
session-key negotiation protocol. This data isn't particularly
secret. <tt  >tls-auth</tt>, however, specifies the path to a secret key file used
by both server and client d&aelig;mons to add an extra level of validation
to all tunnel packets (technically, &ldquo;authentication&rdquo;, as in
&ldquo;message
authentication&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;user authentication&rdquo;).
Although not necessary
for the tunnel to work, I like tls-auth because it helps prevent replay
attacks.
</p><p>
Before I go any further explaining Listing 1, let's generate the files I
just described. The first three, ca, cert and key, require
a PKI, but like I mentioned, OpenVPN includes scripts to simplify
PKI tasks. On my Ubuntu systems, these scripts are located in
/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0. Step one in creating a
PKI is to copy these files to /etc/openvpn, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ cd /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa
bash-$ su
bash-# cp -r 2.0 /etc/openvpn
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that contrary to preferred Ubuntu/Debian practice, I
&ldquo;su-ed&rdquo;
to root. This is needed to create a PKI, a necessarily privileged set
of tasks.
</p><p>
Step two is to customize the file vars, which specifies CA
variables. First, change your working directory to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>copy</em></span> of
easy-rsa you just created, and open the file vars in vi:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# cd /etc/openvpn/2.0
bash-# vi vars
</pre>
</p><p>
Here are the lines I changed in my own vars file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
export KEY_COUNTRY="US"
export KEY_PROVINCE="MN"
export KEY_CITY="Saint Paul"
export KEY_ORG="Wiremonkeys"
export KEY_EMAIL="mick@wiremonkeys.org"
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, initialize your new PKI environment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# source ./vars
bash-# ./clean-all
bash-# ./build-dh
</pre>
</p><p>
And now, finally, you can create some certificates. First, of course,
you need the CA certificate and key itself, which will be necessary to
sign subsequent keys:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# ./pkitool --initca
</pre>
</p><p>
The output of that command consists of the files keys/ca.crt and
keys/ca.key. By the way, if you want pkitool's output files to be
written somewhere besides the local directory keys, you can specify
a different directory in the file vars via the variable KEY_DIR.
</p><p>
Next, generate your OpenVPN server certificate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# ./pkitool --server server
</pre>
</p><p>
This results in two files: keys/server.crt and
keys/server.key. There's nothing magical about the last parameter in
the above command, which is simply the name of the server certificate;
to name it chuck (resulting in keys/chuck.crt and keys/chuck.key),
you'd use <tt  >./pkitool --server chuck</tt>.
</p><p>
Last comes the client certificate. Unlike the server certificate, whose
key may need to be used by some unattended d&aelig;mon process, we expect
client certificates to be used by human beings. Therefore, let's create
a client certificate with a password-protected (encrypted) key file,
like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# ./pkitool --pass minion
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll be prompted twice for the key file's passphrase, which will
be used to encrypt the file keys/minion.key (keys/minion.crt
also will be created by not password-protected). If minion.key falls
into the wrong hands, it won't be usable unless the thief also knows
its password. However, this also means that every time you use this
certificate, you'll be prompted for the key file's password, which I
think is a reasonable expectation for VPN clients.
</p><p>
Now that you've got a working PKI set up, all you'll need to do to
generate additional client certificates is repeat that last command,
but with different certificate names, for example <tt  >./pkitool --pass
minion102</tt>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Warning:</b></span> be careful about how you transmit client certificates and keys to
end users! Unencrypted e-mail is a poor choice for this task. You should
instead use <tt  >scp</tt>, <tt  >sftp</tt> or some other secure file-transfer protocol,
or even transport them manually with a USB drive. Once the client
certificate and key have been copied where they need to go (for example,
/etc/openvpn/keys on the client system), make sure the key file is
root-readable only! Erase any temporary copies of this file you may have
made in the process of transporting it&mdash;for example, on a USB drive.
</p><p>
The OpenVPN server does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need local copies of client certificate
or key files, though it may make sense to leave the &ldquo;original&rdquo; copies of
these in the server's /etc/openvpn/2.0/keys directory (in my examples) in
the event of users losing theirs due, for example, to a hard drive crash.
</p><p>
In the interest of full disclosure, I should note that contrary to my
examples, it is a PKI best practice <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to run a PKI (CA) on any
system that actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>uses</em></span> the PKI's certificates.
Technically, I
should be telling you to use a dedicated, non-networked system for this
purpose! Personally, I think if <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> you use this particular
PKI for is OpenVPN RSA certificates, if your OpenVPN server is
configured securely overall, and you keep all key files root-readable
only, you probably don't need to go that far.
</p><p>
Okay, we've got a working PKI and some certificates. That may have
been a lengthy explanation, but in my opinion, the process isn't too
difficult or unwieldy. It probably will take you less time to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span>
it than it just took you to <span   class="emphasis"><em>read</em></span> about it.
</p><p>
You've got two more files to generate before continuing working down
server.ovpn. To generate your Diffie-Hellman seed file (still working as
root within the directory /etc/openvpn/2.0), use this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# openssl dhparam -out keys/dh1024.pem 1024
</pre>
</p><p>
And, last of all the supplemental files, generate that
TLS-authentication file, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# openvpn --genkey --secret 2.0/keys/ta.key
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb63580.0x1056468"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, I've got good news and bad news. The good news is, you've
made it through the most complicated part of OpenVPN configuration:
creating a PKI and generating certificates and related files. The bad
news is, you've also reached the end of this month's column!
</p><p>
If you can't wait until next time to <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> these
certificates, to get OpenVPN running, you probably can figure
out how to do so yourself. See the openvpn(8) man page and the
sample configuration files server.conf.gz and client.conf under
/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files, upon which my
examples are based. Good luck!
