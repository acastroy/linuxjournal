<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #191, March 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sam Ravnbourg</b></span> has handed off <span   class="bold"><b>KBuild</b></span> maintainership to <span   class="bold"><b>Anibal Monsalve</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Michal Marek</b></span>. They hadn't planned it
this way&mdash;both of them just
volunteered to take over, and Michal suggested a co-maintainership. A
pile of big-time kernel folks thanked Sam for doing all the work
he did on it. He certainly is handing off a very robust and reliable
element of the kernel. We'll see what direction Anibal and Michal take
it now.
</p><p>
In spite of <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>' proclamation
that there was room only for
a single process scheduler in the kernel, that doesn't stop people
from wanting to roll their own and use it. <span   class="bold"><b>Pankaj
Parakh</b></span> is one of
these, and <span   class="bold"><b>Peter Williams</b></span> has been working
on reviving the <span   class="bold"><b>CPU plugin
scheduler project</b></span> on his own (to be renamed CPU_PISCH). In fact, the
two of them may now be working on that together. They're also each
naturally designing their own schedulers to plug in to the kernel, once
they get CPU_PISCH ready. There really are a lot of schedulers out
there, partly because it's a really cool, challenging programming
project, and partly because it's so fraught with deep magic that it
would be difficult for everyone to agree on the best ways for any
scheduler to behave.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LogFS</b></span>, after much struggle, is now headed for inclusion in the main
kernel. The main roadblock was that its on-disk format was in flux,
and including it in the kernel during that kind of change would create
support nightmares inside the kernel, because users of each fluctuation
of the disk format still would need to access their data, long after
LogFS had settled on a final format for itself. There were other
issues as well, but that was the main one. <span   class="bold"><b>J&ouml;rn
Engel</b></span> recently
submitted the updated LogFS to the Linux-Next tree, which typically
means something will be headed in a fairly standardized way up into
the official tree. Not that it's impossible for something to stall out
between Linux-Next and the official kernel, but it's not the usual
case.
</p><p>
A new development policy is in the works, allowing <span   class="bold"><b>subsystem
maintainers</b></span> to migrate drivers they don't like into the
<span   class="bold"><b>staging tree</b></span>.
The staging tree is just a relatively new directory in the official
kernel, where drivers that are not ready for true inclusion can hang
out and be available to users. It's a way to get lots of testing for
things that are still up and coming. Typically, the path is from
outside the kernel, to the staging tree, to a proper place in the
kernel sources. The proposal is to reverse that direction at the
discretion of the subsystem maintainers. There are plenty of pros and
cons, and the debate is fairly heated. Undoubtedly, the policy's
true algorithm will settle down over time, but something along those
lines does seem to have Linus Torvalds' support and the support of a
lot of other folks. It's definitely something that's going to be
worked out in the field, rather than made perfect beforehand. We can
look forward to angry complaints from driver maintainers, and probably
some users, until the kinks are worked out.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>John Hawley</b></span> took advantage of a momentary
lull on <span   class="bold"><b>master.kernel.org</b></span>,
due to it being nighttime in Japan during the kernel summit this past
year, and upgraded the operating system on that server. He reported
that the upgrade went fairly well, with a reboot and a six-hour
configuration effort. At the time he reported on it, there were only
a few remaining glitches left to iron out.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LTTng</b></span> (Linux Trace Toolkit Next Generation) version 0.164 will be
released under some additional licenses. It'll still have the GPL, but
now some of the code will also be released under the LGPL, and some
will be released under the BSD license. <span   class="bold"><b>Mathieu
Desnoyers</b></span> made the
announcement and also said he was still waiting for <span   class="bold"><b>IBM</b></span> to give its
permission to include its contributions in the relicensing effort.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael Cree</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Matt Turner</b></span> have joined forces in common
frustration at the large number (more than a dozen) of unimplemented system
calls on the <span   class="bold"><b>Alpha architecture</b></span>. They plan to work together to
implement them, once they can figure out some of the tricky technical
issues standing in the way.

<h2 class="title">Stupid tar Tricks</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #191, March 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the most common programs on Linux systems for packaging files
is the venerable tar. tar is short for tape archive, and originally,
it would archive your files to a tape device. Now, you're more likely
to use a file to make your archive. To use a tarfile, use
the command-line option <tt  >-f &lt;filename&gt;</tt>. To create a new tarfile, 
use the command-line option <tt  >-c</tt>. To extract files
from a tarfile, use the option <tt  >-x</tt>. You also can compress
the resulting tarfile via two methods. To use bzip2, use the
<tt  >-j</tt> option, or for gzip, use the
<tt  >-z</tt> option. 
</p><p>
Instead of using a tarfile,
you can output your tarfile to stdout or input your tarfile from stdin
by using a hyphen (-). With these options, you can tar up a directory and all
of its subdirectories by using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar cf archive.tar dir
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, extract it in another directory with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xf archive.tar
</pre>
</p><p>
When creating a tarfile, you can assign a volume name with the option
<tt  >-V
&lt;name&gt;</tt>. You can move an entire directory structure with tar by
executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar cf - dir1 | (cd dir2; tar xf -)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can go even farther and move an entire directory structure over the
network by executing:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tar cf - dir1 | ssh remote_host "( cd /path/to/dir2; tar xf - )"
</pre>
</p><p>
GNU tar includes an option that lets you skip the cd part, <tt  >-C
/path/to/dest</tt>. You also can interact with tarfiles over the network
by including a host part to the tarfile name. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tar cvf username@remotehost:/path/to/dest/archive.tar dir1
</pre>
</p><p>
This is done by using rsh as the communication mechanism. If you want
to use something else, like ssh, use the command-line option
<tt  >--rsh-command CMD</tt>. Sometimes, you also may need to give the path to
the rmt executable on the remote host. On some hosts, it won't be in
the default location /usr/sbin/rmt. So, all together, this would look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -c -v --rsh-command ssh --rmt-command /sbin/rmt 
 &#8618;-f username@host:/path/to/dest/archive.tar dir1
</pre>
</p><p>
Although tar originally used to write its archive to a tape drive, it can
be used to write to any device. For example, if you want to get a dump
of your current filesystem to a secondary hard drive, use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -cvzf /dev/hdd /
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you need to run the above command as root. If you are
writing your tarfile to a device that is too small, you can tell
tar to do a multivolume archive with the <tt  >-M</tt> option. For those of
you who are old enough to remember floppy disks, you can back up your home
directory to a series of floppy disks by executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -cvMf /dev/fd0 $HOME
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are doing backups, you may want to preserve the file
permissions. You can do this with the <tt  >-p</tt> option. If you have symlinked
files on your filesystem, you can dereference the symlinks
with the <tt  >-h</tt> option. This tells tar actually to dump the file that the
symlink points to, not just the symlink. 
</p><p>
Along the same lines, if you
have several filesystems mounted, you can tell tar to stick to only one
filesystem with the option <tt  >-l</tt>. Hopefully, this gives you lots of
ideas for ways to archive your files.

If you're the paranoid type and you're still stuck using
Windows, you need to get Eraser.
Eraser is an open-source security tool for Windows that makes sure
deleted files are erased and overwritten completely before they are deleted.
</p><p>
Many of us assume that when we delete a file, it's gone,
but that's rarely the case.
Most deletions merely mark the file as being deleted and
recycle that area of the disk, nothing is written to
it until the space is needed by a new file or by the
growth of an existing file.
</p><p>
Even after the area is overwritten, there are some among
us (and you know who you are) who believe by a careful
analysis of the magnetic fields on the disk surface, one
could reconstruct deleted data.
</p><p>
Even if you don't buy into the black helicopter scenario,
there's no doubt that, at least for a time, your deleted files
may still be accessible. That's where Eraser comes in.
It overwrites the file with other data before it deletes the file.
And, that's not all. Eraser not only overwrites the disk area used by the file,
it also actually gets out a knife and scrapes off that part of the disk surface
that contained the file (just kidding about that last part).
</p><p>
Eraser runs on all modern versions of Windows from Windows 95 on.
It includes its own user interface as well as Windows Explorer extensions.
The current version is 5.8.7 and is available from <a href="http://eraser.heidi.ie" target="_self">eraser.heidi.ie</a>.

If you're the type of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader who waits by your
mailbox every month, setting up a tent to sleep in and taking days off
work as you anxiously await the new issue, quite frankly, we want you

who
would like to hear about the issue as it rolls off the presses, but

<h2 class="title">IRC, Still the Best Support Around</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #191, March 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you haven't gotten our subtle hints during the past year or so, IRC
certainly is not dead. It really is the best way to get knowledgeable
support from the folks who know best. There are a few caveats, however,
that may not be obvious to people new to this old-school chat protocol.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Get a Good Client</b></span>
</p><p>
If you just want to stop into the #linuxjournal channel for some quick
banality, a Web-based client like the one at <a href="http://linuxjournal.com/irc" target="_self">linuxjournal.com/irc</a>
is fine. You can drop in, request a !coffee from JustinBot, and chitchat with fellow geeks. If you're looking for something a bit more
useful for the long haul, a native client makes more sense.
Many people (myself included) like X-Chat. There are plenty of other
options, like the command-line-only Irssi, but X-Chat offers a nice
balance between features and usability. 
</p><p>
If you look back at Kyle
Rankin's Hack and / articles from the past year or so, you'll find easy ways
to integrate your entire lifestyle into IRC. Kyle does everything from
chatting to twittering inside his terminal window, and he shows us all how
to do the same.
</p><p>
The opposite approach, which is actually what I do, is to add IRC as
another instant-messaging protocol on my IM client. Although Kopete and
Empathy may be slick-looking for instant messaging, none come close to
Pidgin's elegance with IRC. Check out my video tech tip on how to
set up IRC inside Pidgin if that makes more sense to the way you work
during the day: <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/irc-chats-pidgin" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/video/irc-chats-pidgin</a>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
IRC Etiquette</b></span>
</p><p>
Every channel you visit will have a different &ldquo;personality&rdquo; to it.
The #linuxjournal channel on Freenode, for example, is really a goofy,
easy-going channel full of geeks having fun. If you come visit us
and say &ldquo;Garble bargle, loopity loo&rdquo;, no one will find you odd.
In fact, you'll fit in quite nicely. On other channels, specifically
channels where developers hang out related to a specific application,
the atmosphere might be a bit more stuffy. My suggestion: hang out in a
room for a while before you post questions. There may be links in the
channel pointing to FAQs or information about how to conduct yourself
without making anyone angry.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Be Patient</b></span>
</p><p>
IRC is the sort of thing most geeks leave running but don't 
monitor constantly. If you pose a question, but don't get a response for a while,
just wait. If you have a question for a specific person, typing his or her
name in the channel often will alert the person (I have Pidgin set up to do
that, and many folks do the same with their IRC clients). And finally, don't
forget, it's a community. If you see a question you can answer, do it!

<h2 class="title">Sync Your Life</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #191, March 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For those of us lucky enough to use Linux on all of our computers,
Canonical's Ubuntu One is a great way to keep files in sync between
computers. Unfortunately, most of us are stuck using other
operating systems throughout the day. We all have our own ways of
managing such things, but I thought a glimpse into my &ldquo;world of
sync&rdquo;
might help others synchronize their lives.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Files</b></span>
</p><p>
At home, I have a centralized file server, and at work, I have the same
thing. But, sometimes I want to access documents 
regardless of my location&mdash;like from a coffee shop during lunch.
For my word processing and spreadsheet files, along with a
handful of other commonly used documents (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> digital PDFs come
to mind), I use Dropbox. It is a cross-platform, free program that allows
you to sync many computers in real time. The free version is limited
to a gig or two, but for basic documents, it's perfect (<a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_self">www.dropbox.com</a>).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bookmarks</b></span>
</p><p>
I use Firefox on every operating system, but even if you are forced to
use Internet Explorer, Safari or Google's Chrome browser,
Xmarks syncs your bookmarks quite nicely between different browsers
on different platforms. The service is free and works very well.
I can't imagine life without Xmarks (<a href="http://www.xmarks.com" target="_self">www.xmarks.com</a>).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Contacts and Calendars</b></span>
</p><p>
Love it or hate it, Google has infiltrated every operating system rather
effectively. I use a plethora of applications to keep my different
devices (laptops, desktops, phones, PDAs) in sync with contacts and
calendars, but they all are based on Google. My favorite feature is that
in a pinch, I can access everything from a Web browser. A quick search
for &ldquo;google sync&rdquo; brings up many options, most free, that should
get you a consistent contact and calendar base across any platform.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Voicemail</b></span>
</p><p>
This is starting to feel like a Google ad, so I'll stop with this one.
Google Voice is the way I consolidate all my phone numbers. I like having
a single number that I can give freely and then filter incoming calls
however I want. Again a free solution, Google Voice offers features I'd
likely pay for, although I'm certainly not complaining at the price.
</p><p>
So, there you have it. I currently have two cell phones, a Skype Wi-Fi phone,
Magic Jack, home landline, work landline, three Linux laptops, one Windows
laptop, one Apple laptop, three desktops at home, three desktops at work and
enough media-playing devices in my house to open a movie theater. If I
didn't sync some of my services, I'd go more insane than I already am!

full of such gems. One of my favorites from the vault is Shawn Powers' video tech

You never know when you'll happen upon a pirate in a dark alley and be very
glad you spent some time on LinuxJournal.com. Oh, it'll happen. Trust me.
