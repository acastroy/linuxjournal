Meet AlienVault OSSIM, a complex security system designed to make your life
simpler.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181b580.0x19132a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Security Information Management (SIM) systems have made many
security administrators' lives easier over the years. SIMs organize
an enterprise's security environment and provide a common interface to
manage that environment. Many SIM products are available today that
perform well in this role, but none are as ambitious as AlienVault's Open
Source Security Information Management (OSSIM). With OSSIM, AlienVault
has harnessed the capabilities of several popular security packages and created an
&ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; that translates,
analyzes and organizes the data in unique and customizable ways that
most SIMs cannot. It uses a process called correlation to 
make threat judgments dynamically and report in real time on the state of risk
in your environment. The end result is a design approach that makes
risk management an organized and observable process that security
administrators and
managers alike can appreciate.
</p><p>
In this article, I explain the installation of an all-in-one
OSSIM agent/server into a test network, add hosts, deploy a third-party
agent, set up a custom security directive and take a quick tour of the
built-in incident response system. In addition to the OSSIM server, I
have placed a CentOS-based Apache Web server and a Windows XP workstation
into the test network to observe OSSIM's interoperation with different
systems and other third-party agents.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181b580.0x1913568"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
To keep deployment time to a minimum, I deployed OSSIM on a VMware-based
virtual machine (VM). OSSIM is built on Debian, so you can deploy it to any
hardware that Debian supports. I used the downloadable installation media
from the AlienVault site in .iso form (version 2.1 at the time of this writing)
and booted my VM from the media. 
</p><p>
On bootup, you will see a rather busy
and slightly difficult-to-read install screen (Figure 1). The default option is
the text-based
install, but by pressing the down arrow, you will see a graphical install
option. Select the Text option and press Enter. If you've seen 
Debian install screens, the OSSIM installer will look very familiar. Set
your language preferences and partition your hard drive(s). Configure
your settings for Postfix if desired. Finally, set your root password, and
enter a static IP address for the server when prompted. The installer
will restart the machine to complete the configuration. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10649f1.large.jpg"><img src="10649f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A little tough to read, but this is where everything starts.
</p></div></div><p>
Open a
browser from a machine on the same network and enter the IP address of
the OSSIM server in the URL field (Figure 2). Enter &ldquo;admin&rdquo; as the user
and password to log in to the management site. Change
your password under the Configuration&rarr;Users section. After logging in,
the main dashboard view loads (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Main Dashboard
</p></div></div><p>
The next step is to add systems for the OSSIM server to monitor. 
Start by defining your local network and performing a cursory scan. On the
Networks tab under Policy, click Insert New Network. Enter your LAN
information in the fields provided. If you don't see a sensor listed,
insert a new one using the hostname and IP address of your all-in-one
OSSIM server. Leave the Nagios check box enabled, but the Nessus box
unchecked (Figure 4) to reduce the time needed for the first scan. After
the scan completes, several hosts should appear on the Hosts tab of the
Policies section. OSSIM installs and auto-configures Nagios and ntop
during installation, so you also can see basic network information by
visiting the Monitors section of the management page (Figure 5). Once
all hosts are found, find the CentOS Web server in the Hosts section
under Policies, and modify its priority from 1 to 5 (Figure 6). You will use
this later in the article when I discuss correlation.

Figure 6. Changing the Web Server's Asset Value
</p></div></div><p>
You now have an active OSSIM server using passive network monitors like
snort, Nagios and ntop to report on your test network's activity. Next,
let's add some client-based agents that feed data into the OSSIM server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181b580.0x19142d0"></a>
Installing the OSSEC Agent</h2></div></div><p>
Many client agents can communicate with OSSIM, but because
of space limitations, I am covering the one I believe is the most valuable to
security administrators: OSSEC. OSSEC is a freely available host intrusion detection
system (HIDS) maintained by Trend Micro that performs a multitude of
client security tasks, such as logging, alerting, integrity checking and
rootkit detection. Additionally, a large number of OSSIM plugins for
OSSEC already are installed with your server that can monitor virtually any
part of a UNIX/Linux/Windows system.
</p><p>
First, let's install OSSEC on the CentOS Web server. Download and
extract the client tar from the OSSEC Web site. If you have difficulty
finding the OSSEC agent, or any other agent, links to
OSSIM's supported third-party agents are available in the Tools/Downloads section of
the management page. Next, run the install.sh script from the unpacked
tar folder. Verify your machine information and select the agent install
option. Accept the default install directory. Enter the IP address of
the server (the OSSIM server). Run the integrity-check d&aelig;mon and enable
the rootkit-detect engine. When asked to enable active response, answer
&ldquo;no&rdquo;.
To start the agent, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, from the CentOS Web server, <tt  >ssh</tt> to the OSSIM server, and
run the following command to add your client agent to the OSSEC server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
</pre>
</p><p>
Select A to add an agent, and enter a unique name for it. Add
the IP address of your CentOS Web server and give the agent a unique
ID. The default ID usually is fine, unless you plan on implementing a
naming convention for your OSSEC clients. Enter Y to confirm adding the
agent. This returns you to the main menu. Select E to extract. Input
the client ID you want to extract (the ID you assigned to the CentOS
server). From another terminal window on the CentOS Web server, run the
local manage_agents command. Select I to import the unique key. Copy
and paste the unique key from the SSH window to the Web server's local
prompt. Enter Y to confirm the key, and select Q to quit. Close the SSH
connection, and from the local prompt, restart the agent by running the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
</pre>
</p><p>
On your XP client, download and install the OSSEC agent as well as the
Putty SSH client. When finished, run the Putty client to SSH to
the OSSIM server and repeat the same manage_agents command to generate
and extract the XP client's unique key from the server. Once extracted,
paste it into the XP client by opening the Manage Agent applet from the
start menu under the OSSEC program group.
</p><p>
Finally, to begin receiving OSSEC events in OSSIM, open the file
/etc/ossim/ossim_setup.conf on the OSSIM server and in the [sensor]
section add <tt  >ossec</tt> to the end of the line that begins with
the word detectors. Save and exit the config file, and restart your OSSIM server
using the <tt  >shutdown -r now</tt> command. Upon reboot, you should start to see
OSSEC events appear in OSSIM. To test this, restart the OSSEC agent on
the XP machine and look in the Events&rarr;SIM Events section of the OSSIM
management page. You should see messages related to the OSSEC agent
(Figure 7). As you now have an external feed coming into your OSSIM
server, let's look at how it digests and analyzes the data.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10649f7.large.jpg"><img src="10649f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Events, Alarms, Directives and Correlation</h2></div></div><p>
For OSSIM to decipher data from any source, it first must have a plugin. A
plugin is an XML-based configuration file that tells OSSIM how to
read information from a particular data source and when to register a
security event. According to the AlienVault site, more than 2,300
plugins currently are available (see the Popular OSSIM Plugins sidebar for a brief listing of
the leading ones). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181b580.0x1914ab8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
An event is any occurrence that a plugin's native
software deems important enough to log or warn on. Events in OSSIM should
be treated like log entries. They are not necessarily indicative of a
problem, but should be reviewed nonetheless. When multiple events take
place in such a way that an administrator has marked them as being
&ldquo;suspicious&rdquo;, OSSIM
throws an alarm. It is also possible for a plugin to set a single
event's settings high enough that it can throw an alarm when the single event
occurs. The criteria used to trigger an alarm from multiple different
events is known as a directive. The process of analyzing multiple events
within a directive is called correlation. Correlation is central to
OSSIM's operation. With correlation, administrators can take data from a
multitude of disparate security devices and tailor directives to reduce
false positives and extrapolate threat data in real time.
</p><p>
Take a typical IDS (Intrusion Detection System) device, for example. An improperly tuned IDS can record
a large number of false positives. However, with OSSIM, you can create a
directive that correlates your IDS events with known vulnerabilities in
Nessus. By doing so, you reduce false positives and refine questionable
data into a valuable security check. As another example, you could
correlate multiple port scans from Nmap with failed logins from syslog
(or OSSEC, as I explain later) to detect break-ins. A third example would
be to correlate aberrant network behavior using ntop with rootkit checks
from OSSEC or virus detections from Sophos, ClamAV or McAfee to monitor
for client-based threats. With the number of plugins available for OSSIM,
the possibilities for correlation are almost limitless.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x181b580.0x1d0dde0"></a>
Custom Directives, Risk and Incident Response</h2></div></div><p>
Let's create a simple directive so you can see correlation in action.
As an example, let's use a simple directive to monitor suspicious access
to the Web server using two different plugins. In order to do so, first
turn down the values for your OSSEC plugin. From the OSSIM management
page, go to the Plugins section under Configuration. Scroll through the
tables to find Plugin ID 7010, and click on the ID column to edit the
plugin's values. On the resulting page, change the reliability values
for the SIDs 5503 and 5716 from 5 to 1 (Figure 8). If you left these
values at 5, they would send an alarm before the rule is processed.
Because the goal is to observe correlation, you need to turn them down.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10649f8.large.jpg"><img src="10649f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Adjusting the Reliability of Our Plugin's SIDs
</p></div></div><p>
Click on the Directives link found under the Correlation section of the
navigation pane. From here, you get a brief description of how directives
are ordered and processed. Click on the Add Directive line in the top
left of the page. In the resulting fields, enter &ldquo;Unauthorized Access
to Web Server&rdquo; as the Name. In the blank field next to Id, enter 101,
which places your directive in the Generic directives group. Set
the Priority to 2 and click Save. On the next page (Figure 9), click on
the + symbol to add a rule to your new directive. In the Name field, type
&ldquo;NMAP Scan on Web Server from Foreign Host&rdquo;. Enter 1001 as the Plugin Id
(snort). In the Plugin Sid field, type &ldquo;2000537, 2000545&rdquo;, and under the
Network section in the To field, type in the IP address of your CentOS
server and the Port to List 22. In the Risk field, set Occurrence to 3,
Reliability to 1. Set the Sticky field to True and Sticky Different
to SRC_IP. Click the Save button at the bottom of the page. 
</p><p>
In theory,
you have a directive that will send an alarm when a host runs an Nmap
scan against port 22 on your Web server. However, you won't receive alerts
yet. In order for a directive to send an alarm, the risk of the directive
being tripped must be greater than 1. 
</p><p>
Although I have not talked much
about risk until now, it is integral to the function of correlation.
Risk is the primary factor used by the correlation engine to determine
when alarms are generated. It is calculated using a series of subjective
numerical values assigned by the agents and administrators. Expressed
in mathematical form, the formula for risk looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Risk = (priority x reliability x asset) / 25
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10649f9.large.jpg"><img src="10649f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. The First Rule of the Test Directive
</p></div></div><p>
Priority is the number OSSIM uses to prioritize rules. It is set at the
Directive level. Priority can have a value of 0&ndash;5. 0 means OSSIM should
ignore the alert. A value of 5 means OSSIM should treat this as a serious
threat. Reliability refers to how reliable a rule is based on the chance
that it's a false positive. It is set at the individual rule level and can be
cumulative if there is more than one rule in a directive. Possible values
for reliability are 1&ndash;10, and they equate to percentages, so 6 would mean a
rule is reliable 60% of the time. Asset is the value that represents
the importance of a host. You assigned the highest possible priority (5)
to your CentOS server in the Policies section earlier in the article.
</p><p>
At this point, you have one rule under your directive, but no correlation, so
you need to add another rule. Click on the + symbol on your directive. Give
the new rule a name of &ldquo;Too Many Auth Failures&rdquo;. Set the Plugin ID to 7010
(OSSEC), and set the From field to the IP address of your Web server as
the OSSEC agent will show the Web server as the source of the events. Set
Occurrence to 4 and Reliability to 0 for now. Click Save. After adding
the second rule, navigate to the row of the new rule and move the mouse
over the directional arrows that control how rules are treated inside the
directive. The up and down arrows are similar to AND statements, meaning
both rules must match, and the left and right arrows nest rules within
each other like nested IF statements. Move your second rule to
the right. Open the second rule back up and change the reliability to +2,
which will increase the reliability by 2 over the previously processed
rule (3 if the first rule is met). Now, if both rules are met, the risk
will be &gt; 1 and an alarm will be generated. Listing 1 shows the directive in
XML format.

   &lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/directive&gt;

</pre></div><p>
To generate an alarm, log on to the XP client and download Nmap. Run four
scans against the CentOS server using the zenmap GUI and the quick
scan option. Then, <tt  >ssh</tt> to the same server and attempt to log in as root,
but enter an incorrect password five times. You should see a new alarm in the
Unresolved Alarms link at the top of the page. Access this link and find
the alarm triggered by your test directive (Figure 10). Identify the row
with your test alarm and click on the icon resembling a sheet of paper in
the Action column to open a new Alarm Incident (Figure 11). A new window
will pop up and display basic information about the incident that will
be used to create a ticket. Click OK to confirm the information, and the
full ticket editor will load. Add a description and any other pertinent
information to this page, and click on the Add ticket button. You should
see a new Unresolved Ticket on the indicator at the top of the
page. To edit a ticket, navigate to the Tickets link in the Incidents
section of the navigation pane. From here you can add notes, attach files
and change the status of your tickets. A ticket will no longer show
in the list once its status is set to Closed. Although quite simple,
this built-in ticketing system contains the necessary functionality to
satisfy most enterprises' incident-response needs. OSSIM also contains
a knowledge base that you can use to link tickets and external documents
that adds another layer of depth to its incident response system.

The Sky's the Limit</h2></div></div><p>
This brief walk-through barely touches on the power of
OSSIM. Its correlation abilities and its multitude of plugins make
it an intriguing alternative to the traditional SIM. If you factor in
the ability to write your own plugins, you have a tool that is fully
customizable for any environment and whose value is limited only by your
creativity. The makers of OSSIM have given SIMs a new intelligence that
hopefully will drive innovation in the field and take security management
to the next level.
