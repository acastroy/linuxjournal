CountBeats&mdash;BPM Finder
(<a href="http://www.mellowood.ca/countbeats/index.html" target="_self">www.mellowood.ca/countbeats/index.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
This month, I'm covering projects I've wanted to showcase but have
held off on due to space constraints.
CountBeats is a cracker of a little
application&mdash;it's simple, yet it covers such a need for so many
musicians, so I'm proud to give it top billing here.
To quote the README file: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This is a simple little program designed to help you determine the
speed of a piece of music on the radio or on a CD.
</p><p>
To use it, just invoke the program from the command line. You'll
be presented with a screen describing the program, a time-bar, and a
few buttons. Most should be self-explanatory. Just start tapping the
spacebar in time to the music...the tempo bar will update and show how
many beats per second are being played.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10696f1.large.jpg"><img src="10696f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
CountBeats is an ingenious little program for determining the tempo of a song by
simply tapping away on the keyboard in time to the music.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
First, there is a library you probably won't
have installed: Tkinter. This was under the package name python-tk on
my system, but it's worth looking in your local package manager
for yours. The only other requirement seems to be a working version of
Python 2.x onward.
</p><p>
Otherwise, installing this thing is a walk in the park. Simply download
the 1K (!) tarball from the Web site, extract it, and open a terminal in
the new folder. From here, run CountBeats simply by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./countbeats
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The README file did a pretty good job of explaining how it all works,
but I can expand on it a little further. As soon as you have a song for
which you
want to find the BPM rate, start the program and press the spacebar
in time with the music. The more times you do this, the more accurate the rating
will be, so stick with it for a good minute or two. If you want to clear
away previous readings and start again (perhaps when another song comes
on), click Clear at the bottom-left corner.
</p><p>
Given the cumbersome nature of a spacebar, it's generally best if you
track a song's quarter notes, as eighths or sixteenths may track a bit
inaccurately. If you know your way around Python syntax (which I don't),
you may want to change the key to something like Ctrl for faster music.
</p><p>
That small niggle aside, this is an invaluable tool for musicians. Many
times I've been working on a project and forgotten to note what tempo a
song was in, making tracking a nightmare at times. DJ-remixing types
probably will use this most of all, as they can use it to gauge
the speed of whatever songs they're piecing together and work out which
samples will be compatible with each other. All in all,
this is a brilliant tool that is simple to use and install, and it probably
takes the prize for smallest file size of any project I've covered!

wxGuitar&mdash;Tuning Reference for Acoustic Guitars
(<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gguitar-01" target="_self">freshmeat.net/projects/gguitar-01</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you like minimalism and are chasing a tuning reference for
your acoustic guitar, this may well be the project for you.
I especially meant that minimalism part&mdash;the only info I could find
on the project's Freshmeat entry was the following:
&ldquo;wxGuitar is a useful application that will easily help the novice
guitarist to faster (and better) tune the guitar.&rdquo;
And, that's pretty much it&mdash;that's all the information I can find
anywhere on the Net. But, maybe I can illuminate things a little here.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10696f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
wxGuitar is a very simple reference tool for tuning an acoustic
guitar by ear. But an H string? An amusing typo!
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
I couldn't find an actual home page for wxGuitar, so you have
to make do with the files provided on the (brief) Freshmeat page. Source
is provided, along with Debian and Gentoo packages. As far as libraries
go, the INSTALL file says you'll need wxWidgets &gt;= 2.8.10 (I had to
install libwxbase2.8-dev), along with alsa-utils, including aplay. If
you're running with the source, once you have the needed libraries, grab
the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder.
Enter the following commands to compile wxGuitar:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro supports sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install 
</pre>
</p><p>
If not:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su 
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once wxGuitar is installed, you may have it in your system's menu,
or you can run it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ wxGuitar
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
When you're inside the main screen, I think you'll find it rather
straightforward. wxGuitar is very basic. Turn your speakers on and
press any of the buttons on the left to play the corresponding note. The
notes start from the highest note E string and go down to the lowest
note E string. The second button is curiously marked H, but unless
there's some kind of unique Eastern European scale I don't know about,
logic dictates that should be a B string.
</p><p>
Press the button on the left for each string's note, and play the
corresponding string on your own guitar as you fine-tune it. If you look
on the bottom-left corner, there's a repeat option that will be set to
every three seconds by default, which can be made longer or shorter if
you so desire.
</p><p>
That's pretty much all there is to it. wxGuitar may not be complex
(and if you're looking for a sophisticated tuning recognition program, you should
look elsewhere), but if you want a minimalist program to
tune by ear, this is probably for you.

Ding&mdash;German-to-English Reference
(<a href="http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding" target="_self">www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Are you a Rammstein fan trying to decipher those wacky
lyrics or a Porsche fan trying to figure out exactly what
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doppelkupplungsgetriebe</em></span> means? Are you chasing a German-English translator
that's simple to use and painless to install? This is probably the
best place to start, especially if you have to type such accents
as umlauts and the like (see what I mean further on).
According to Ding's Freshmeat entry:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Ding is a dictionary lookup program for the X Window System on
Linux/UNIX. It comes with a German-English dictionary with about
253,000 entries. It is based on Tk version &gt;= 8.3 and uses the agrep or
egrep tools for searching. In addition, Ding also can search in English
dictionaries using dict(1) and check spelling using ispell(1). It has many
configuration options, such as search preferences, interface language
(English or German) and colors. It has history and help functions and
comes with useful key and mouse bindings for quick and easy lookups.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10696f3.large.jpg"><img src="10696f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Ding is a simple yet powerful dictionary tool for translating between
German and English. Note the handy collapsing menus for derivations on
root words.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10696f4.large.jpg"><img src="10696f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
A particularly handy feature is quick access to Germanic characters&mdash;something most English-based OS installations won't be set up for.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing Ding is really easy. Head to the Web site, and you'll
find a number of different packages along with a tarball. As usual,
I'm running with the tarball for the sake of neutrality. Download the
tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder.
</p><p>
If your distro supports sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./install.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
If not, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# sudo ./install.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll want to install the German aspell files for certain
parts of program functionality. Once the installation has finished,
run the program with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ding 
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Although I haven't much space to cover Ding's usage,
the interface is pretty basic anyway. To start,
enter a word in German or English, and either click
Search or press Enter. At this point, any translated possibilities
and variants show up below, with Deutsch (German) on the left and
English on the right. You also may see a small cross icon next to each
translation. Click it, and variants are displayed in a collapsible
menu from the root word, such as plurals, example usage and so on.
</p><p>
It's well worth looking in the Preferences
menu and clicking the Show umlaut buttons option. This shows the
special Germanic characters most English editions of OSes won't
be set up for. Other features include a spell checker, as well as orthography,
but I'll let you explore things for yourself from here.
</p><p>
Although Ding may be rather gray and not pretty, it's nice and
minimalist and easy to install with a minimum of fuss. I'm sure that
90% of its users will be those English-speaking Rammstein fans trying
to work out what's being said, but why not?

<span   class="bold"><b>Gnaural</b></span> (<a href="http://gnaural.sourceforge.net" target="_self">gnaural.sourceforge.net</a>)
</p><p>
In the spirit of this month's &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; column, I'm taking a
look at recent developments in some of the coolest projects I've been
fortunate enough to cover here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> in the past. My favorite project
of all time is Gnaural. For those not in the know, Gnaural is an
application to generate Binaural Frequencies that can speed up or slow
down brainwaves for relaxation or alertness, using a basic PC and a
simple pair of headphones. A recent addition to the CVS code by a user
under the mysterious nickname of noname36 has added the extra functionality
of using Isochronic Tones instead of Binaural Frequencies, which brings
yet more application to an already amazing program.

</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span>, an authentic rebuild of the classic PC
platformer <span   class="emphasis"><em>Commander
Keen</em></span>, has continued to become more stable and has been ported to more
platforms. A separate project run by other fans also has started up,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Commander Genius</em></span> (aka
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeenPlus</em></span>), which includes things like OpenGL
2.0 support, new graphical effects and a Normal and Hard mode, among
other new features. Thankfully, <span   class="emphasis"><em>CloneKeen</em></span>'s creator Caitlin Shaw also
has joined the project.

</p><p>
This racing sim, aimed at the realistic racing crowd, has been
gaining more realism and features over
time. New features include car collision in Single Race mode, a much more
capable AI (along with a new difficulty slider) as well as improved
performance. But what really jumps out at me are tweaks to the actual
feel of the game. It previously felt very detached, often making
the process of driving more of an intellectual exercise than an intuitive
one. Small touches, like tyre-spin noise when off-road, and bigger ones,
such as a &ldquo;bouncy&rdquo; camera for hood view, should make for a game that is
much more playable with a solid feel. I look forward to the full release.
