If you're wondering when the command line will die, the answer
is simple: when we all decide to give up and use Windows.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e7580.0x14df250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Linux graphical desktop has improved vastly since its inception
some 18 years ago. Gone are the days in which system configuration
necessitated use of the command line. The Ubuntu generation has come
to age in a world where using the command line is optional. Although many
people still choose to hone their console skills, just as many do not.
</p><p>
The command line, however, is far from irrelevant. Whether you are
trying to get the most out of an older system or wanting to access your
applications from anywhere over SSH, the console still remains one of
the most powerful tools in the Linux user's toolbox. From traditional
system utilities to Web and multimedia applications, there are many
CLI (command-line interface) versions of our desktop staples. Here's a small selection of my
favorites that are still in popular use today.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e7580.0x14df4b8"></a>
Internet</h2></div></div><p>
A wide selection of Web applications run on the Linux shell. Dedicated
downloading and torrenting applications are a natural choice for
running at the command line. With the addition of a tool such as
screen or dtach, long downloads can be run remotely on an always-on
machine. Likewise, text-based browsers can be used for executing downloads
that are too deeply buried behind redirects for curl or wget. Console
browsers also are invaluable as tools for testing Web site accessibility
or avoiding noxious advertising&mdash;especially on machines with limited
resources.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>rTorrent</b></span> (<a href="http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no" target="_self">libtorrent.rakshasa.no</a>)
</p><p>
A popular text-based BitTorrent client, rTorrent boasts an impressive
feature set. It supports partial downloading of multifile torrents and
session saving, and it can be used with screen or dtach. rTorrent also
has a built-in XMLRPC interface with a number of third-party Web-based
front ends available. This combined with rTorrent's ability to watch a
specified directory for the appearance of torrent files&mdash;and when
found, execute them&mdash;allows users to create a powerful remote
torrenting tool with ease.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Wget</b></span> (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/wget</a>)
</p><p>
Of course, a torrenting server with a Web-based front end is
over-engineering the solution just a little if you need to download
only an ISO or two without interruption. Wget is a simple utility for
downloading files over HTTP, HTTPS and FTP. It is included in most
Linux distributions. Wget can be used to download individual files
or mirror entire Web sites. It supports downloading through proxies,
resuming partial downloads and various forms of authentication.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Curl</b></span> (<a href="http://curl.haxx.se" target="_self">curl.haxx.se</a>)
</p><p>
Another simple downloader, Curl is both a tool and a library for
transferring data over a range of protocols. Curl, of course, supports HTTP,
HTTPS and FTP, but it differs from Wget in also supporting LDAP, POP3 and DICT,
among others. Curl also supports downloading through proxies, resuming
partial downloads and various forms of authentication.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>w3m</b></span> (<a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net" target="_self">w3m.sourceforge.net</a>)
</p><p>
A pager like <tt  >less</tt> or <tt  >more</tt> for HTML files, w3m supports rendering both
local HTML files and remote URLs. It supports operating through a proxy,
cookies and SSL. As it is designed to act as a file pager or viewer,
w3m must be invoked either with a remote URL or a local file as an argument.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>ELinks</b></span> (<a href="http://elinks.or.cz" target="_self">elinks.or.cz</a>)
</p><p>
If you are looking for something with a little more functionality,
ELinks is an extremely feature-rich text-mode browser. It's capable
of displaying tables and frames, and as of version 0.10, ELinks can
render CSS and supports up to 256 colors. ELinks makes for a powerful
downloading tool. It's able to download multiple files at once and perform background
file transfers while you are browsing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10854f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e7580.0x14dff08"></a>
Instant Messaging/Chat</h2></div></div><p>
Running a client in a screen session still is extremely popular among IRC
users. Running IRC on a remote server accessed via SSH provides access
to IRC from restricted networks and allows for messages to be left with
your client for you to read on your return. Chat logs are kept in one
place, instead of being spread across every computer you use. And,
instant messaging can benefit from being run at the console for all of
the same reasons.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Irssi</b></span> (<a href="http://www.irssi.org" target="_self">www.irssi.org</a>)
</p><p>
Irssi is a very popular IRC client for the console. Features include
logging, custom formatting and themes, configurable key bindings and
many, many others. Irssi provides a powerful Perl scripting interface,
with many contributed scripts available from Irssi.org. Irssi uses
a windowing interface that allows for dozens of server connections,
channels and messaging windows to be open and accessible at once.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10854f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. IRSSI IRC Client
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Finch</b></span> (<a href="http://pidgin.im" target="_self">pidgin.im</a>)
</p><p>
If you've used Pidgin, you'll find Finch hauntingly familiar. Finch is
a CLI instant-messaging program that is part of the Pidgin codebase and
uses the libpurple instant-messaging libraries. Finch's user interface is
modeled as closely to Pidgin as ncurses will allow. They both will save
their configuration to the same directory (~/.libpurple), and if Pidgin
already is configured on your machine, Finch will pick up its settings
automatically. Finch supports chatting on all of the protocols included
with libpurple: AIM, MSN, Yahoo! and Jabber, just to name a few.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>naim</b></span> (<a href="http://naim.n.ml.org" target="_self">naim.n.ml.org</a>)
</p><p>
Supporting AIM, ICQ, Lily and IRC, naim is an elegantly designed
alternative to Finch if you don't need all of libpurple's
protocols. naim
uses a very simple command-driven interface. All text entered with
a preceding / is considered a command, and all other text is sent
as a message to the current active window. naim supports simultaneous
connections to multiple networks and IRC servers, with each &ldquo;window&rdquo;
displayed in a slide-out list that can be called up with the Tab key.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e7580.0x14e0698"></a>
Productivity</h2></div></div><p>
The cloud notwithstanding, a small but fervent minority still prefers to
access e-mail via the console. Whether it's the celebrated speed of
text-mode clients or the ability to access one's e-mail and calendar
over SSH, command-line productivity applications still have a surprisingly
strong following.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mutt</b></span> (<a href="http://www.mutt.org" target="_self">www.mutt.org</a>)
</p><p>
Mutt is an e-mail client that supports both reading local UNIX mail spools
and retrieving remote mail over POP or IMAP. It's capable of handling
everything one would expect from an e-mail client and more. Some notable
features include the ability to customize fully the information contained
in the mail header and the ability to store different configuration
settings depending on the current folder or e-mail recipient.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10854f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Mutt E-mail Client
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alpine</b></span> (<a href="http://www.washington.edu/alpine" target="_self">www.washington.edu/alpine</a>)
</p><p>
Alpine is a complete rewrite of the popular Pine e-mail client by the
original authors, the University of Washington. It adds support for
Unicode among other new features, and it's released under an open-source
instead of a freeware license. Alpine supports POP, IMAP, SMTP and
LDAP. Unlike Mutt, Alpine is configured using a menu-driven interface that
some may find easier to use. People who use Nano as their editor will have
a head start, as Nano is a port of the Pico editor, which was included
with Pine and has been re-implemented with Alpine. Of course, any other
UNIX editor can be set as the composing interface for Alpine.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>pal</b></span> (<a href="http://palcal.sourceforge.net" target="_self">palcal.sourceforge.net</a>)
</p><p>
pal is a powerful calendaring program. It makes full use of terminal
color support to highlight events. To-do-style events are supported,
and HTML and LaTeX generation allows you to create calendar files for
printing. A nifty tip suggested by the author is to add pal to the
shellrc file so that it displays every time you open a terminal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e7580.0x18d8fc8"></a>
Multimedia</h2></div></div><p>
Somewhat unintuitively, console-based multimedia players enjoy wide
popularity. Command-line music players can be used to take advantage
of better speakers on another machine or to provide the base of a large,
multisystem, distributed home-media solution. Even image editing at the
console is surprisingly full-featured with tools designed to manipulate
batches of images from scripts.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MOC</b></span> (<a href="http://moc.daper.net" target="_self">moc.daper.net</a>)
</p><p>
MOC (Music on Console) is a CLI music player that will have a familiar
interface to users of Midnight Commander. MOC supports, among others,
Ogg Vorbis, MP3 and FLAC. It outputs to ALSA, OSS or JACK and can create
and load M3U playlists. MOC utilizes a client/server architecture that
allows the user to detach MOC from its graphical interface to reclaim
its controlling terminal for other uses, while leaving the playlist
still running in the background.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10854f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>cdparanoia</b></span> (<a href="http://xiph.org/paranoia" target="_self">xiph.org/paranoia</a>)
</p><p>
cdparanoia is a CD-ripping tool that subscribes to the UNIX philosophy
of doing one task and doing it very well. Designed to be a high-quality
ripper that has excellent knowledge of CD hardware, cdparanoia and those
tools based on it have a reputation for succeeding where others have
failed. cdparanoia will read raw data from a music CD and output it as
WAV or 16-bit PCM to either a file or stdout. Encoding to a more usable
format and populating that format's metadata will need to be achieved with
a different tool. cdparanoia makes up for this minimalism by including
smilie characters meaningfully in its status output. So cute!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Music Player D&aelig;mon</b></span> (<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/mpd" target="_self">freshmeat.net/projects/mpd</a>)
</p><p>
Music Player D&aelig;mon (MPD) is a network-aware music server. It acts
as a back-end service for a range of clients to access locally or
over a network. It also can act as a music converter, able to utilize
various audio input plugins and output to a different output plugin. MPD
maintains a music database or library. Playback of local files not in
the database is supported only by local clients for reasons of security.

Editors</h2></div></div><p>
No command-line roundup would be complete without a look at traditional
UNIX text editors. Whether you're keeping notes, building a Web site,
editing system configuration files or writing Linux kernel patches,
there is a console editor fit for the task.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Vi/Vim</b></span> (<a href="http://www.vim.org" target="_self">www.vim.org</a>)
</p><p>
Voted as the favorite editor of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> users in the
2009 Readers'
Choice awards, the Vi family of editors has been around since the mid-1970s. Vim's design suits system administration tasks with a focus on
ease of moving around complex files and making small precise edits. Vim-specific enhancements turn the humble editor into a powerful programming
tool with support for context-sensitive completion, syntax highlighting
and comparison and merging features. Vi also serves as the core precept
of religion for many UNIX users, whose holy doctrine speaks of the coming
of the Vim-im-again, who will vanquish the false GNU-headed god, Emacs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10854f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Vim Editor
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GNU Emacs</b></span> (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/emacs</a>)
</p><p>
The Emacs family of editors also can claim a long heritage, and their
development also started in the 1970s. Although most users utilize
X11, Emacs is fully functional at the command line. Emacs is strongly
extensible, with a powerful recorded macro capability, and it includes an
interpreter for its own dialect of the Lisp programming language. Emacs
is not content to stop at being a capable programmer's editor with
plugins available to use Emacs for IRC, Web browsing, e-mail and news, 
just to name a few. Emacs has often been featured as a combatant in the holy
editor war against its arch nemesis Vi. Emacs users quite often
are bewildered by this, as most of them are prepared to admit that Vi is an
exceptional text editor, but that it should be just as clear to Vi users
that Emacs is the better operating system.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nano</b></span> (<a href="http://www.nano-editor.org" target="_self">www.nano-editor.org</a>)
</p><p>
Based on Pico, the editor included with the Pine e-mail client, Nano has
earned its wide popularity by being one of the most user-friendly console
editors around. Nano supports syntax highlighting for many languages,
customizable key bindings and a soothing display of the key bindings for
the most commonly used commands at the bottom of the screen. The only
way Nano could be any friendlier is if it displayed the
words &ldquo;Don't Panic&rdquo; in large, friendly letters on the top of the
screen.

Hopefully, I've inspired some purely GUI users to investigate the world
at the command line, and perhaps I've reminded the already-console-savvy about
applications they may have forgotten. Many other popular command-line
applications exist that haven't been included here. To get a listing of
other applications available for your distribution, try searching your
distribution's packaging system for &ldquo;console&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ncurses&rdquo; or &ldquo;cli&rdquo;.
