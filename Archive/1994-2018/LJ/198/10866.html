Robert Aiello and Leslie Sachs' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Configuration Management Best
Practices</em></span>
(Addison-Wesley)</h2></div></div><p>
The editorial duo of Robert Aiello and Leslie Sachs joined forces to pen
a new Addison-Wesley title, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Configuration Management Best Practices:
Practical Methods that Work in the Real World</em></span>. The book is a guide
to effective configuration management (CM)&mdash;that is, establishing and
maintaining consistency in the performance of a system, as well
as its functional and physical attributes throughout its lifetime.
The bulk of the book's content comes from lead author Bob Aiello's
25 years of experience implementing and supporting CM. The result is a
practical and actionable guide to best practices that will enable the
reader to implement CM effectively in realistic business, engineering
and government environments. The thorough coverage outlines six main
tenets of CM: source code management, build engineering, environment
configuration, change control, release engineering and deployment.

Anthony Minessale, Michael S. Collins and Darren Schreiber's <span   class="emphasis"><em>FreeSWITCH
1.0.6</em></span> (Packt
Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
The goal of the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>FreeSWITCH 1.0.6</em></span> by Anthony Minessale,
Michael S. Collins and Darren Schreiber is to get you up and running with
the FreeSWITCH telephony system quickly and easily. FreeSWITCH is an open-source telephony platform designed to facilitate the creation of voice
and chat-driven products, including everything from a soft phone to a PBX
to an enterprise-class soft-switch. The authors begin by introducing
the architecture and workings of FreeSWITCH before detailing how to plan
a telephone system and moving on to the installation, configuration
and management of a feature-packed PBX. They also cover
maintaining a user directory, XML dial plan and advanced dial plan
concepts, call routing, and the powerful Event Socket.

Userful Linux MultiSeat 2010</h2></div></div><p>
Linux and schools are natural allies, which is the rationale behind
Userful Corporation's new Linux MultiSeat 2010&mdash;a complete Linux-based
K&ndash;12 classroom software solution on a single install DVD. The product is
essentially a bundle of Userful's flagship product, Userful Multiplier,
which turns one computer into ten, and hundreds of free end-user and
education-specific applications. Schools can equip classrooms or computer
labs with a single computer while offering users their own monitor,
keyboard and mouse. Userful says that Linux MultiSeat 2010 provides
superior video performance to Microsoft Windows Multipoint Server
and calls it &ldquo;the lowest cost shared resource computing solution on
the market&rdquo;. The product is based on the Edubuntu distribution.

Skout Forensics' Data Collection Kit</h2></div></div><p>
Real-life CSI types will want to have paper and pencil (and browser)
ready to note details of Skout Forensics' Data Collection Kit, a solution
that allows one to acquire electronic data in a forensically sound manner
from any standard PC. The kit is targeted at companies, law firms,
governmental entities and individuals who need help with internal and
external investigations and court-ready reporting of digital evidence, as
well as electronic discovery, data recovery, preservation and analysis.
The approach involves the enumeration of all attached devices and
imaging them separately just as a trained examiner would. Furthermore,
the kit integrates all required forensic standards in a manner that can
be executed by anyone. It has the ability to collect data from
a computer seamlessly, both while powered on and while powered off. Skout Forensics
says that its innovative approach to computer forensics provides its
customers with faster, less intrusive and more cost-effective and
user-friendly electronic evidence collections and analysis than solutions
currently on the market.

Visualization Sciences Group's Open Inventor 3D Graphics Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>
Visualization Sciences Group (VSG) calls the new version 8.1 of its
popular object-oriented 3-D graphics development toolkit, Open Inventor,
an &ldquo;essential release&rdquo;. VSG says that v.8.1 brings &ldquo;even
greater performance, more high-quality graphics, more interactivity
and more robustness to interactive applications&rdquo;. Thanks to numerous
optimizations, generalized use of the latest OpenGL techniques and finely
tuned memory consumption, Open Inventor 8.1 delivers a display rate that
is now nearly equivalent to the peak performance of graphics hardware.
This new release also introduces a dynamic display resolution mechanism,
whereby advanced rendering effects are progressively applied during
interaction, refining image quality on the fly, without sacrificing
interactivity. Open Inventor 8.1 is now available for C++ and .NET,
on Linux and Windows 32- and 64-bit platforms.
