VirtualBox often is called a &ldquo;desktop&rdquo; virtualization
solution, but it's just as capable of being a server solution.
And contrary to what you may believe, no GUI is required; you
can manage it all from the command line.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d48580.0x1e40358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm just a command-line kind of guy. I prefer not to have a GUI
running on my servers taking up resources and potentially exposing
security issues, and fitting with that mindset of favoring simplicity
and economy, I'm also fairly frugal. I don't like to pay more than
necessary. I hear peers in the IT field discuss the complexity of
their environments and how much they pay for their virtualization
solutions, shaking their heads in mock sympathy for each other, while
bragging rights go to whomever has the biggest, most complex, most
expensive environment. Meanwhile, I listen politely until I
eventually chime in, &ldquo;I pay nothing for my virtualization solution
and manage it from the command line. Oh, and did I mention, our
startup just started turning a profit.&rdquo; Then come the blank stares.
</p><p>
Being a firm believer in the benefits of free, open-source software, I
prefer software that is either pure FOSS or at least has an open-source version available, even if some premium features are 
available only in paid versions. I believe that over time, this
produces superior software, and I have a safety net so that my fate is
not entirely in the hands of one commercial entity. For all of these
reasons, I use VirtualBox as the primary virtualization software in my
organization. That choice was made before Sun&mdash;who bought the
creators of VirtualBox, Innotek&mdash;was in turn bought by Oracle, who
also just bought another virtualization provider and had put years of
considerable effort into developing a Xen-based solution, throwing the
future of VirtualBox into limbo.
</p><p>
Many of the details on the direction Oracle/Sun will take with
virtualization are still up in the air, but things look promising.
Xen, while being elegant and providing performance with which other
methods of virtualization can't compete, has proven to be a bit of a
disappointment in terms of being able to support packaged solutions
and keeping up with the features of other solutions. Since the
purchase of Sun, there have been a number of 3.0.x maintenance
releases of VirtualBox, the beta release (3.1) was formalized into 3.2.0, and there
have been two maintenance releases since, getting us to 3.2.4 at the
time of this writing. I have it from one of the developers working on
the project that at 40,000 downloads a day, VirtualBox is still one of
the most popular pieces of software in the Oracle/Sun portfolio. See
Resources for a link to Oracle's VirtualBox Blog, where 
Oracle has officially announced
VirtualBox as an Oracle VM product. Indeed, it
wouldn't make sense to throw this valuable commodity in the trash, as
VirtualBox is much younger yet compares favorably in many respects to
the 800-pound gorilla of virtualization, VMware. VirtualBox is
performant, reliable and simple to manage. To get all the features in
the latest release of VirtualBox, you'd have to shell out some major
dough for VMware's top-of-the-line product.
</p><p>
Our two primary VirtualBox hosts have two four-core CPUs per host, 48 gigs of
RAM apiece, and ten SATA2 10K RPM drives each, in RAID 0+1, running the
x86_64 kernel. Based on initial testing, I expected that we would be
able to run about 10&ndash;15 virtual hosts each on this hardware, but to my
surprise, we currently are at 20 hosts apiece and counting, with
headroom. I give each virtual machine one CPU, which makes it stick
to one CPU core at a time, and as little memory as possible,
increasing those if performance demands it. Using this methodology,
we've achieved an environment where if you didn't know the machines
were virtual, you couldn't tell these machines weren't on dedicated
hardware. The load average on one host rarely tops 1.0 for a 15-minute
average and rarely tops 2.0 on the other, so we still have some
headroom. I'm now thinking we may be able to run 30 or more machines
per host with enough RAM, and possibly more.
</p><p>
I run VirtualBox on Ubuntu Server, which we standardized on for legacy
reasons. We currently are on the 3.0.x branch of VirtualBox and are testing upgrades
to 3.2. Unfortunately, there still isn't a &ldquo;non-GUI&rdquo; package for
VirtualBox on Ubuntu, so installing it without also installing Xorg
and Qt packages involves the use of the
<tt  >--force-depends</tt> option to
dpkg (or the equivalent on your system). The OSE (open-source
edition) version is available via apt-get in the standard
repositories, but I recommend downloading the latest version directly.
I'm showing you the install I did of the latest stable version at
the time I last upgraded the production systems, but to get all the
latest features, like teleportation of virtual machines to other hosts,
you'll need to go with the latest 3.2.x version:


<pre     class="programlisting">
loc=http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/3.0.14/
wget $loc/virtualbox-3.0_3.0.14-58977_Ubuntu_karmic_amd64.deb
# or appropriate package for your distro/architecture
dpkg -i --force-depends \
     virtualbox-3.0_3.0.14-58977_Ubuntu_karmic_amd64.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
dpkg will complain about missing dependencies. You can ignore most of
them, but you will need to satisfy the non-GUI dependencies to have
full functionality. Subsequent to this, you will find that when you
need to install or upgrade packages via the apt utility, it will
complain about broken dependencies and refuse to do anything until you
resolve the problem. I get around this by taking down all
the virtual machines on a host, bringing up the essential ones on another
host, uninstalling the virtualbox package, performing my upgrades or
installs, and then re-installing. It's an extra step and takes a few
minutes, but on your production virtualization hosts, this probably
isn't something you will be doing terribly often, as it should have a
minimum of required packages to start with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dpgk -r VirtualBox-3.0.14
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
dpkg -i --force-depends \
     virtualbox-3.0_3.0.14-58977_Ubuntu_karmic_amd64.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
Once things are installed, everything is exposed via the command line.
In fact, the GUI is only a subset of what is available via the CLI.
Currently, configuring port forwarding and the use of the built-in
iSCSI initiator are possible only via the CLI (not via the GUI). Try
typing this in and pressing Enter for some undocumented goodness that
has saved me many hours and headaches:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VBoxManage internalcommands
</pre>
</p><p>
The usage information available by typing partial commands is exhaustive, and
the comprehensive nature of what is available allows for many custom
and time-saving scripts. I've scripted all the repetitive things I
do, from creating new VMs to bouncing ones that become troublesome after
a month or so of uptime. Not only can you shell script, but there also is a
Python interface to VirtualBox, and the example script, vboxshell.py,
ships with the standard distribution.
</p><p>
A few notes on efficiency and performance&mdash;you'll do well to set up a
&ldquo;template&rdquo; virtual machine installation of your various operating
systems that has your environment's configurations for authentication,
logging, networking and any other commonalities necessary. You'd
also need to throw in your performance enhancements, like for
instance, adding <tt  >divider=10</tt> to the GRUB kernel configuration,
resulting in a line like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.18-164.el5 ro \
      root=/dev/VolGroup01/LogVol00 rhgb quiet divider=10
</pre>
</p><p>
This will require some experimentation in your environment, but most
systems are set to a 1,000Hz clock cycle. Even on a host with idle
guest systems, the number of context switches that occur simply to
check for interrupts can result in high load on the host. This boot-time
parameter will divide the clock frequency by ten, reducing the
number of context switches by a factor of ten as well, and reducing
host load greatly. This might not be suitable for all workload types,
but running it on the guests for which it does not produce
unacceptable performance will speed up the system overall and most of
your guests.
</p><p>
Consider the example script in Listing 1. Like most of the scripts I write, it's
quick and dirty, but if you follow this example, you'll have a basic
infrastructure in place that you can use to provision and
manipulate an almost unlimited number of virtual servers quickly. It takes
no variables or input on the command line, supplying the information
internally, but it easily could be modified to allow passing parameters
via command-line switches. Let's say you need to bring up many virtual
machines based on your base disk image. You will give the virtual
machines sequential IPs and hostnames. The example script has a few
prerequisites you'll have to satisfy. First, the disk image you are
starting with must be a fixed size, not dynamically allocated. If you
have a dynamic .vdi you want to use, first convert it using clonehd:


<pre     class="programlisting">
VBoxManage clonehd dynfile.vdi statfile.vdi --variant Fixed
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you'll need the mount_vdi script (see Resources), which 
is quite handy in itself, as it mounts the .vdi file as if it were an
.iso or raw disk image. And, you'll need to be able to execute it via
sudo to create and mount loopback devices. I have edited the
mount_vdi.sh script to comment out the lines telling you to type end
to unmount and exit the script, and the last few lines of the script
that actually do so, moving those functions into the top-level
script. You'll need to do likewise for the script in Listing 1 to work.
Once you've tested the mount_vdi.sh script, change the path to it in
the script in Listing 1 to the appropriate one on your host system.
</p><p>
Assumptions made for the purposes of this particular script include the
following:
you are running a fairly recent Ubuntu as host and guest with
VirtualBox 3.0.x (what I run in production); the .vdis are in the
current working directory where the script is located; there are no
loop devices (/dev/loopx) on the system already; the root partition is
the first one on the virtual disk; the hostname on the base vdi image
is basicsys.example.com; it has one Ethernet interface, and the IP
address is 1.1.1.1 with a default gateway of 1.1.1.2. The script will
be less painful, especially during testing, if you set up your
virtualbox user to have password-less sudo, at least temporarily. I've
tested the script now on several systems and with slight variations in
.vdi age and format, so I'm reasonably confident it will work for a
wide variety of environments. Be warned; I have found that
VirtualBox 3.2.x, which I am now testing, requires a few changes.
Should you run into trouble and solve it, drop me an e-mail at the
address in my bio, and let me know, so I can improve the script for future
generations.

If you get this script working, you are well on your way to having the
infrastructure in place to support a manageable, flexible,
cost-effective, robust virtualization environment. Personally, I'm
looking forward to getting 3.2.x in place and being able to teleport
running machines between hosts to manage workloads in real time&mdash;from
the command line, of course. Stay tuned, my next article will deal
with the back-end shared storage (based on open protocols and free,
open-source software, while being redundant and performant). I intend
to connect my virtualization hosts to support being able to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VBoxManage controlvm vbox-vm-3 \
           teleport --host vbox-host-2 --port 17001
</pre>
