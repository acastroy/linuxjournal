<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span>
(<a href="http://quantumminigolf.sourceforge.net" target="_self">quantumminigolf.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
For anyone interested in quantum mechanics, and the double-slit experiment
in particular, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span> is a great little game that should
amuse the most hardened physicist. According to the project's documentation:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span> is a minigolf simulation, in which the ball
behaves according to the laws of quantum mechanics. Such a quantum
ball can be at several places at once and diffract around obstacles. 
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span> exists in two versions:
1) the software-only version, which you have most probably in
front of you when you read this file, and 2)
a virtual-reality version. Here, the user plays with a real
club, which is marked by an infrared LED and tracked by a
Webcam. The ball is projected to the ground by a video
projector mounted on the ceiling. 
Basically, the software release contains all the necessary 
code to build the virtual-reality version. However, building
it will not (yet) be easy, since it is not documented yet. 
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10861f1.large.jpg"><img src="10861f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Compiling <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span> is pretty easy, but you need to chase
down some fairly obscure libraries. The project's README lists the
following requirements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
fftw3f: the single precision (!) version of libfftw, <a href="http://www.fftw.org" target="_self">www.fftw.org</a>
</p></li><li><p>
SDL: <a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target="_self">www.libsdl.org</a>
</p></li><li><p>
SDL_ttf: <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf" target="_self">www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf</a>
</p></li><li><p>
freetype: <a href="http://www.freetype.org" target="_self">www.freetype.org</a>
</p></li><li><p>
Linux Libertine open fonts: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/linuxlibertine</a>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you have the needed libraries, grab the latest tarball, extract it,
and open a terminal in the new folder. Enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make 
</pre>
</p><p>
Provided there are no errors, you should be able to run the program
by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./quantumminigolf
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span> has two modes of operation:
virtual reality (VR) mode and software mode. The VR mode works externally
in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, with a projector, a camera and a ball that is
projected onto a field. The software version is merely a basic simulation
that takes place on the computer screen. I cover the software
version here, but see the VR Mode sidebar for more information on the real-world
version.
</p><p>
Once you're inside the main game screen, you'll receive a series of
instructions on how to control the game. The basic controls you really need to
understand are left and right to change course, and Enter to start playing.
Moving the mouse changes your putter's aim.
</p><p>
When you're aimed and ready to go, click and hold the left-mouse button
(the longer you hold it down, the more power is applied), and the ball
will start moving.
</p><p>
Assuming you're in Quantum Mode, the ball will switch from a solid
object to a waveform and will bounce around the course in all sorts of
strange ways. Press the spacebar or q, and the ball will stop and switch back
from this quantum state into a solid object&mdash;probably in the wrong area
if it's your first time. It's really up to you to guess where
the ball will end up given where the waveforms are at the time. And, if
you're unadventurous or just want to test the basic mechanics, you can play it
in normal mode, but that's not really the point of this game, is it?
</p><p>
What's really fascinating about this game is how the quantum world
interacts with the basic, solid, &ldquo;Newtonian&rdquo; world. You can watch the
movement of light <span   class="emphasis"><em>around</em></span> an object in real time, but in so many
complicated ways! Here's more information from Friedemann's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
For the experts: hitting the ball, you define an initial momentum. The
ball is then initialized as a Gaussian wavepacket of hard-coded width,
centered around the driving position in position space and around the
initial momentum in momentum space.
</p><p>
...Since a quantum mechanical ball is most of the time at several places
at once, it is impossible to say whether it is in the hole or not. It
is just &ldquo;at once inside and outside&rdquo; the hole.
However, there is a trick: quantum mechanics allows one to make a
&ldquo;position measurement&rdquo;, which will let the ball collapse at a certain
position. Think of this as taking a photo of the ball. A quantum particle
can be at several places at once, but in a photo, it will always appear
in one and only one position....At the end of each game, you take, thus, a virtual photo of the track. If
the ball appears in the hole, you win. Otherwise you lose. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In much the same way that Valve's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Portal</em></span> took a very simple concept
and made an amazing game, if you took these quantum gameplay
mechanics and applied them to a big 3-D game, what would be the result? Now, that
would be fascinating.

VR Mode</b></p><p>
This game gets a lot spicier out in the real world. Here, you can
play with a real club and ball, which is projected onto the track by a
video projector mounted on a six-foot-high tripod. The club is marked by
an infrared LED and is detected by a Webcam next to the video projector. An
image recognition algorithm in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quantum Minigolf</em></span> software computes
the club position and feeds back hits into the simulation.

Art of Illusion&mdash;3-D Modeling Studio
(<a href="http://aoi.sourceforge.net" target="_self">aoi.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I usually cover things only in the 0.x development stage, and although this
certainly couldn't be called a new project (it's been going since 1999), it seems to have flown under most people's radar. According to
the project's 
Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Art of Illusion is a free, open-source 3-D modeling and rendering
studio. Many of its capabilities rival those found in commercial
programs. Highlights include subdivision surface-based modeling tools,
skeleton-based animation and a graphical language for designing
procedural textures and materials.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10861f5.large.jpg"><img src="10861f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
An example from the Web site of some of the brilliant effects AOI is
capable of (albeit the Windows version in this shot).
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10861f6.large.jpg"><img src="10861f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Art of Illusion is in a class of its own when it comes to easily
manipulating 3-D objects on the fly.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
As far as requirements go, you'll need a basic Java installation
to get at least minimal functionality. AOI requires Java 1.5 or later,
and it does not work correctly under GCJ, which is preinstalled in many
Linux distributions. Two relatively obscure requirements 
are worth chasing, as they greatly extend the functionality of the
program. Java Open GL (JOGL) gives you 3-D-accelerated functionality,
which is invaluable in animation work, and the Java Media Framework
(JMF) lets you save animations in QuickTime format rather than a
series of still images. JOGL is most likely in your distro's repository,
but you can grab JMF at Sun's site: <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html" target="_self">java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html</a>.
</p><p>
The Web site provides a zip file containing a Java-based installer designed
for i586 and AMD64 architectures, though other UNIX and architecture
options are available if you look further down the page. Grab the
latest file and extract it. Inside is an installer with the filename of
aoisetup.sh; execute this, though you may want to be running as root or
sudo if you want to put it somewhere all users can run it.
</p><p>
If this is new to you, open a terminal in the folder where AOI's setup is
waiting for you, and enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
(enter password)
# ./aoisetup.sh 
</pre>
</p><p>
Or if you're using a sudo-based distro like Ubuntu, try entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ./aoisetup.sh 
(enter password)
</pre>
</p><p>
From here, you'll be given a basic Next, Next, Next-style GUI
interface, which should be familiar to most users. At the end of the
installation, open a terminal where AOI was installed (the default being
/usr/local/ArtOfIllusion), and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./aoi.sh 
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Although I hardly can do justice to the features in AOI in this short space,
I'll at least introduce some of the main elements.
</p><p>
Four panes take up most of the screen that contain the camera
angles for the scene on which you'll be working. These are ready to be
&ldquo;drawn&rdquo;
in immediately. A simple sidebar on the left contains the most
common tools, such as move, rotate, resize, create a square, create a
sphere and so on. This makes jumping in and actually making something
so much quicker and more intuitive than most other 3-D modeling programs
I've come across.
</p><p>
Wisely, more-advanced functions are contained within the menus in the
toolbar, but they too are easy to navigate and are well thought out. Some cool
features include script and repository management, immediate rendering
and animation previewing, and although I didn't get a chance to use it
myself, there's something called a Procedural 3-D Texture editor that
looks really powerful.
</p><p>
Although this program may be simplistic in its presentation, the project's
goal always has been to provide features found in advanced commercial
applications (and even add a few unique features along the way) while
retaining a user interface that is substantially easier to come to grips
with than the commercial offerings.
</p><p>
Some of the features that really stood out to me were 
scriptable objects, animate-able textures, distortion effects (like
twisting and shattering), skeletal animation with weighting, constraints,
and inverse kinematics, as well as rendering to HDRI images.
</p><p>
All of this adds up to a very powerful yet elegant program that runs
cross-platform, so convincing colleagues to try it might not be
such a tricky proposition. If you look around the Web site and forums,
you'll see some truly stunning images that have been made with AOI&mdash;some
so realistic I had to look a second time to realize they were
computer-generated!
</p><p>
I'm by no means an expert in this area, but this project deserves a great
deal more attention than it has received thus far. Although a program like
Blender instantly comes to mind with 3-D modeling, I've never even heard
this program mentioned before. Hopefully, that's about to change.
