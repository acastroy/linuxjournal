Skip ahead on the mutt learning curve with real-life mutt
configuration examples.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x2722408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Mutt is my favorite e-mail client and the one I use every day both professionally
and personally. The greatest yet most challenging thing about mutt is
how incredibly configurable it is. As you use a program, you might think
&ldquo;I wish it did X, Y or Z&rdquo;, but in the case of mutt, most of the major
settings you want to tweak are available for you to change. If you
have used mutt for many years like I have, you find that you go through a
few phases with your .muttrc (the main configuration file for mutt). When
you start using mutt, you spend a lot of time just trying to figure out how
to set up mutt to read your mail (usually with the help of someone else's
.muttrc). After you get mutt working, the next phase involves tweaking
more and more sophisticated options, such as folder hooks. Eventually
though, your .muttrc is finely tuned just the way you like it, and you
change it only rarely. These days, I usually change my .muttrc
only to add a new mailbox.
</p><p>
What I realize is that no matter how great I might think mutt is,
if someone else wants to give it a try for the first time, the learning
curve is a bit intimidating. In past columns I've discussed advanced
settings for mutt, but in this column, my goal is to walk you through the
one thing that intimidates mutt users the most when they start out: mutt
configuration. Hopefully, by the end of the column you will have a basic,
functional mutt configuration you can use to check your e-mail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x27226c8"></a>
Mutt Is an MUA</h2></div></div><p>
These days, mutt should be available as a package for just about any major
distribution, so I'm not going to cover how to install it&mdash;just use your
package manager. If you are used to a regular, graphical e-mail client,
two main things are different about mutt. For
one, it is designed to run completely from a terminal controlled by
your keyboard. Second, mutt is strictly a Mail User Agent (MUA) and
not a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA). Most graphical e-mail clients not
only can access and read your e-mail as a MUA, but they also know how to be an MTA
(they can communicate with a mail server directly via SMTP to send out
e-mail). Unlike those clients, mutt is strictly concerned with accessing
and reading your mail, and it relies on a separate MTA. This means if your
Linux system doesn't already have a mail server configured, you will need
to set up a basic one. If you need some tips on how to do that, check out
my &ldquo;Make a Local Mutt Mail Server&rdquo; column in the February 2010 issue.

Well-Organized Mutt Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Although you certainly can set up your mutt configuration any way you want
(as long as the core config is in ~/.muttrc), because you are doing this for
the first time, you might as well set up a system of configuration files
instead of one giant .muttrc. Because mutt allows you to reference other
configuration files from within the .muttrc, many mutt users organize
their options into different files. What I like to do is separate
the configuration into different categories stored under ~/.mutt. I
also store my .muttrc file there with the ~/.muttrc file symlinked to
it. Finally, I create a ~/.muttrc.local file that I use to store any
options I want to keep local to this machine. These are options
like whether to access a remote IMAP server versus a local maildir,
or other such local settings. Now this may seem like a lot of work, but
the point is that once you get your mutt configuration how you
want it, you simply can rsync the ~/.mutt directory to the rest of your
machines without wiping out any local settings.
</p><p>
I realize that no sample mutt config is going to please everyone, but
here are some basic settings that I think should get you off to the
right start. I've added comments to options where I feel they need
extra explanation, but plenty of options are uncommented, so if you are
curious about what an option does, the best resource is the official
mutt documentation at <a href="http://mutt.org" target="_self">mutt.org</a>. Every now and then I find myself
browsing through the documentation there just to look for some new
(or new to me) options that I didn't know I couldn't live without.
</p><p>
First, let's look at my main ~/.mutt/.muttrc file. Remember that I actually
create a symlink from this file to ~/.muttrc with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s ~/.mutt/.muttrc ~/.muttrc
</pre>
</p><p>
Also, it may go without saying, but you need to create the ~/.mutt
directory as well. Listing 1 shows a basic starter ~/.mutt/.muttrc.

</pre></div><p>
As you can see, this muttrc file is quite involved. Besides the
rather large list of options I defined, I also have included separate
configuration files with the source option. For instance, I have separated
out all my mutt color configuration into ~/.mutt/colors. Listing 2 shows a
good sample ~/.mutt/colors file you can use to get started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x2722da8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. Sample ~/.mutt/colors</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# color settings

</pre></div><p>
All of the color options follow the same syntax. First, the word color,
then which object should be colorized and finally the foreground and
background colors to use. I use default as my background color, so if
I have a transparent window, the background is also transparent. You'll
notice that the color options for the index (the mutt window that lists
all of the messages in a mailbox) has an extra option at the end that
lets you control what attributes it should match before it applies that
color. For instance, in these two options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
color index	brightyellow default ~N	# New
color index	yellow default ~O	# Old
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x2723068"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the ~N and ~O arguments match any new or old messages, respectively.
You
can use mutt's extensive matching language to match on all sorts of
message attributes. In the above file, I provide a commented example for
how to colorize a message based on its FROM: header.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x27231c8"></a>
Local Mutt Settings</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned earlier, I like to separate any settings that might differ
between machines into a ~/.muttrc.local file. Here's an example of the
settings you might want to keep there if you had all of your e-mail stored
in a local Maildir folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# local mbox settings
set mbox_type=Maildir
set folder=~/Maildir
set spoolfile=+INBOX
set record=+sent-mail
save-hook . "+saved-messages-`date +%Y`"
mailboxes "=INBOX"
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is an example .muttrc.local for a system that accesses mail remotely
via IMAP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set folder=imaps://mail.example.net/INBOX
set imap_user=username
set imap_pass=password
set spoolfile=+
set record=+.sent-mail
save-hook . "=.saved-messages-`date +%Y`"
</pre>
</p><p>
Note here that I specify both the IMAP user name and IMAP password. If
you want extra security, you will want to leave out the imap_pass option
so your password is not in plain text. If no password is specified,
mutt will prompt you when it connects to that IMAP server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x2723430"></a>
Mutt Mailboxes</h2></div></div><p>
After you define your main mail folder settings, you also will want to 
define any other mailboxes you have besides INBOX. I keep these mailboxes
defined in ~/.mutt/mailboxes, and I should note that the order does matter
here. Whatever mailboxes you define in your configuration files will be
checked by mutt for new mail. When you tell mutt to change to a different
mailbox, it automatically will fill in the mailbox name with the next
mailbox that has new mail. I use this feature a lot, especially at work,
as it allows me to make sure I go through all of the high-priority
mailboxes with new mail first. Here is a sample mailboxes file. Note
that the = sign tells mutt that these folders are off the main folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mailboxes "=linuxjournal"
mailboxes "=consulting"
mailboxes "=nblug"
mailboxes "=saved-messages"
mailboxes "=sent-mail"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x2723590"></a>
Hooks</h2></div></div><p>
The final configuration file worth mentioning is ~/.mutt/hooks where I
store all of my folder hooks and other settings. Hooks are a powerful
feature in mutt that allow you to change your mutt settings on the fly
based on your current folder, the recipient of an e-mail or contents in
an e-mail when you reply to it. Hook syntax can get a bit complicated, so I
recommend if you want to know more about a particular option, especially
the index_format and folder_format syntax, that you reference the official
documentation on mutt.org. Listing 3 shows a few example hooks I use to change
how messages are sorted in some folders, tweak what signature to use on
certain e-mail messages and even change my TO address when I reply to a message.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x262a580.0x2723748"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Example Hooks</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# The first options set defaults
unset sig_on_top
# default hook is 'set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} 
# %-15.15L (%4l) %s"'
folder-hook . 'set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%4l) %s"'
folder-hook . 'set sort=date'
folder-hook . 'my_hdr From: Kyle Rankin &lt;foo@example.com&gt;'
send-hook . unset signature

# Set special options when I'm in my nblug folder
folder-hook nblug 'set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} 
 &#8618;%-15.15F (%4l) %s"'
folder-hook . 'set sort=date'
folder-hook nblug 'set sort=threads'
folder-hook nblug 'set signature="~/.mutt/.sig.nblug"

#default folder_format="%2C %t %N %F %sl %-8.8u %-8.8g %8s %d %f"
set folder_format="%2C %t %N %8s bytes - %d %f"

# these settings will pick a different signature file to use 
# depending on whether I'm sending email to nblug.org (one of my 
# mailing lists) or one of my consulting clients
send-hook '~t @nblug\.org$' 'set signature="~/.mutt/.sig.nblug"; 
 &#8618;my_hdr From: My Name &lt;foo@example.com&gt;'
send-hook '~t client@example\.com$' 
 &#8618;'set signature="~/.mutt/.sig.consulting"; my_hdr From: 
 &#8618;My Name &lt;bar@example.com&gt;'

# This is the actual hook I use to make sure emails to my 
# Linux Journal address have the proper FROM headers
reply-hook '~t lj@greenfly\.net' 'my_hdr 
 &#8618;From: Kyle Rankin &lt;lj@greenfly.net&gt;'
</pre></div><p>
So there you have it. If your interest in mutt is piqued, these
options should be more than enough to get you started. I also know that
these settings won't appeal to everyone. That's the beauty of mutt&mdash;you
can change the options until they do suit you. I still recommend once
you get your base options configured that you spend a little time with
the official documentation on mutt.org. There are many great examples and
also many more options than I listed here that might solve a particular
configuration problem you are having.
