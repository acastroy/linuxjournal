The Ben NanoNote provides a command line you can fit in your
pocket. It's lighter than most smartphones, it costs around $100, and
it's based on free and open-source software and hardware.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee9580.0xfe12a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The command line is something I always want in any computer or gadget
I own. For me, it symbolizes ultimate access and control. When I heard
about the Ben NanoNote from Qi Hardware and learned it primarily
was a command-line device, I knew I had to get one and play with it. It also
doesn't hurt that it costs only $99 ($124 after shipping).
</p><p>
Qi Hardware is a firm believer
in not only open software, but also open hardware. According to its
Web site, its mission is &ldquo;to promote and encourage the development of
copyleft hardware&rdquo;. As part of this mission, full documentation on the Ben
NanoNote is available on the Web site, including circuit-board layouts,
schematics and other hardware documentation.
</p><p>
Granted, I probably never will have the tools or expertise to create
my own NanoNote from parts, and even if I could, I probably wouldn't 
be able to do it for less than what it costs to purchase one.
But, the documentation is available, and it is under a license that lets
me do it if I had the inclination.
</p><p>
Incidentally, &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; refers to a Chinese character meaning
&ldquo;origin&rdquo;,
&ldquo;root&rdquo; or &ldquo;beginning&rdquo;. The idea is that this is the initial or first
version of what eventually will be a complete line of NanoNote and other
related products.
</p><p>
The Ben NanoNote is built around the JZ4720 366MHz MIPS-compatible
processor from Ingenic Semiconductor with a three-inch, 320x240 pixel
color TFT LCD (40x15 character in the text console). It has 32MB SDRAM,
2GB NAND Flash memory, one microSDHC slot (SDIO-capable), a 59-key
keyboard, a headphone port, a mono speaker and a USB 2.0 Mini port. It is
powered by a 3.7V 850mAh Li-ion battery, or it can run off USB power
(5V 500mA DC) either by plugging it in to your computer or by using one
of the increasingly common USB power adapters (my phone, camera and
eBook reader all came with USB power adapters). The Ben NanoNote earns
the &ldquo;nano&rdquo; part of its name, measuring only 99x75x17.5mm. Including the
battery, the Ben NanoNote weighs in at only 126g, which is lighter than
my cell phone.
</p><p>
Four days after ordering the Ben NanoNote, it arrived on my doorstep in
North Carolina&mdash;not bad for coming all the way from Hong Kong. It
comes in an attractive black box containing the Ben NanoNote itself,
a manual (most of which is devoted to printing the full text of the
Creative Commons BY-SA license), a microfiber cleaning cloth, a battery,
a USB cable and a little rubber nub for shorting the &ldquo;USB Boot&rdquo; pins
in the battery compartment.

Figure 4. The Ben NanoNote's keyboard, featuring the world's
smallest spacebar.
</p></div></div><p>
The build quality is decent with no gaps or loose bits. The keyboard
has an okay feel to it, even though it is a bit stiffer than I prefer. And,
despite it having the world's smallest spacebar, the layout actually
works pretty well for command-line work&mdash;except that the dash (-) key is
is annoyingly placed.
</p><p>
The sound quality out of the single speaker is tinny and prone to
distortion, but it's what I expected. If you must listen to music on
the Ben NanoNote, external speakers or headphones are the way to go.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee9580.0xfe2068"></a>
Flashing the Ben NanoNote</h2></div></div><p>
Like many embedded devices, upgrades to the core software are done by
flashing the device to the newest firmware. Unlike other handheld devices,
which can flash themselves or be flashed by copying some files to the
device via USB, the Ben NanoNote needs to start in a special &ldquo;USB Boot
mode&rdquo; to be upgraded. Full instructions are on the Qi Hardware Wiki,
but the basic steps are as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Install the Xburst tools (used for booting the Ben NanoNote over USB).
</p></li><li><p>
Download the reflash_ben.sh script from the Qi Hardware Wiki.
</p></li><li><p>
Put the Ben NanoNote into USB Boot mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Run the reflash_ben.sh script.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Putting the NanoNote into USB Boot mode was harder than I thought it would
be. To do this, you need to take out the battery and plug the Ben NanoNote
in to your computer (if the screen comes on when you plug it in to your
computer, unplug the USB cable briefly and plug it back in; the screen
should stay dark). Next, use the little nub that came with the Ben
NanoNote (or some other piece of conductive material) to short the two
USB Boot pins found in the (now empty) battery compartment. While
keeping the pins shorted, and without unplugging the USB cable, you
have to press and hold the power button for two seconds. Because
the power button is on top and the pins are on the bottom, this was not
very easy for me to do. Even worse, the indication that you've
succeeded is that nothing happens&mdash;when the screen stays dark after
holding the power button for two seconds.
</p><p>
After going through the contortions it takes, I would prefer some sort
of icon on the screen or even a little indicator light to confirm I am
in the proper mode, but for now, that's the process. When in USB
Boot mode, the Ben NanoNote is waiting for the usbboot utility (one of
the Xburst tools) to give it an image from which to boot.
</p><p>
The final step, running the reflash_ben.sh script, is nicely hands-free. The script automatically fetches the latest firmware (unless
you specify a specific version) and then boots and flashes the Ben
NanoNote. The main root image is more than 140MB, so downloading may take
some time, depending on your Internet connection. Flashing the rootfs
also took several minutes. Patience, or a nice snack break, are required
for this step.
</p><p>
After flashing my Ben NanoNote, unplugging it and re-inserting the battery,
I knew all was well when it booted and I saw the OpenWrt logo, and then
the graphical &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo; (Figure 5). Although the flash procedure is
not overly difficult,
it's not ideal, and I hope it improves over time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10850f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Ben NanoNote &ldquo;Desktop&rdquo;
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee9580.0xfe28a8"></a>
The Ben NanoNote GUI</h2></div></div><p>
The Ben NanoNote uses the OpenWrt Linux distribution, which is
used for embedded Linux devices. Prior to using it on the Ben NanoNote,
my only exposure to this distro had been on wireless routers.
</p><p>
Unlike my experience with OpenWrt on routers, the Ben NanoNote version
comes with a desktop of sorts. The desktop is Gmenu2X, and by default, it
has two sections: applications and settings. You can switch between
sections using the q and p keys. Navigate within a section 
by using the direction pad, and to launch a selected application icon,
use the x key. The Enter key is configured to launch the GMenu2X
configuration program for some unknown reason.
</p><p>
The selection of desktop applications included in the default firmware
is sparse in the extreme. There is a clock, the GMU music player, the
StarDict dictionary and a file browser called Explorer.
</p><p>
The GMU music player, according to its home page, is capable of playing
a wide variety of sound files, but only with the proper supporting
libraries, several of which are not available in the Ben NanoNote default
firmware. As it ships, GMU on the Ben NanoNote can play Ogg Vorbis,
Muse, MikMod and WavPack files. Most of my music is encoded in FLAC
or MP3 format, so any ideas I may have had to use the Ben NanoNote as
a scriptable music player are on hold.
</p><p>
After playing around with GMU for a bit, just to confirm that it worked
with my .ogg files (it did), and after trying out the other desktop apps,
I decided the Ben NanoNote's graphical interface wasn't for me. It
just isn't very useful. To be fair, the graphical interface is there
more as an example than anything else. But, I was more
interested in the command line anyway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee9580.0xfe2b68"></a>
The Ben NanoNote Console</h2></div></div><p>
To switch to a console from the desktop, press Ctrl-Alt-F1, and then
press Enter to activate the console. The Ben NanoNote actually gives
you four virtual consoles, and you can substitute F2, F3 or F4 for F1 in
the above command.
</p><p>
To get back to graphical mode from the command line, press
Alt-F5. To switch between virtual consoles, press Alt and the console
to which you want to switch (F1&ndash;F4). If the virtual console you switch to says
&ldquo;Please wait while graphical environment is loading...&rdquo; or some other
text, just press Enter to activate it.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, the Ben NanoNote's console size is 40x15
(40 characters wide, 15 lines tall). For the next NanoNote, I hope this
is increased at least to 80x24.
</p><p>
Like many embedded Linux environments, the OpenWrt command line is based
on BusyBox. Instead of sticking just with BusyBox, the Ben NanoNote
version of OpenWrt also includes several useful programs to supplement
it. For example, Vim 7.1 is included. It's a stripped-down version
(for example, no syntax highlighting is available), but it's still better than
the vi clone built into BusyBox.
</p><p>
The Qi Hardware Wiki (see Resources) provides a list of some of the command-line applications
included with the Ben NanoNote, such as Python, GPG,
Vim and Mutt.
</p><p>
As I mentioned earlier when talking about the keyboard, the layout
works fairly well when using the console. It's far from ideal, but
it does work. After some practice, I could type at a slow but steady
rate without a lot of hunting and pecking for the next key.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee9580.0xfd9710"></a>
Networking</h2></div></div><p>
Many, if not most, portable devices come with some variant of 802.11
wireless networking these days. So, I was a little surprised when
I learned the Ben NanoNote's only way of connecting to the Internet
was through its USB port, which, when connected to a host computer,
does not show up as a mass storage device but instead as a USB
Ethernet device.
</p><p>
Unless you already have an Ethernet-over-USB adapter plugged in to your
system, the NanoNote interface likely will show up as usb0. A list
of all network interfaces your computer knows about can be viewed using
the ifconfig command, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig -a -s
</pre>
</p><p>
To activate the Ethernet interface, an IP address needs to be assigned. I
did this with the ifconfig command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig usb0 192.168.254.100
</pre>
</p><p>
I chose the above address because the NanoNote comes out of the box with
the USB Ethernet configured with an IP address of 192.168.254.101. SSH
starts automatically when the NanoNote boots, so as soon as the network
was configured on my desktop, I was able to <tt  >ssh</tt> to the NanoNote as root
(change the root password on the NanoNote if you don't know it). You
also can copy files to and from the NanoNote using <tt  >scp</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee9580.0xfd9a80"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
While using the Ben NanoNote during the past couple weeks, the one
question in the back of my mind has been: what exactly is the Ben NanoNote
good for?
The short answer I arrived at is: I don't know.
</p><p>
On the surface, the Ben NanoNote can do many things, but it is nowhere
near the best or even particularly good at any single one of them.
In particular, without a wireless Internet connection, it can't be used
conveniently for e-mail, Web searching, posting blog updates or
anything else that small, Internet-connected devices are good at. It
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be used for those things, but only within 15 feet of a computer
(the maximum length of a USB cable). So in my mind, I might as well use
the computer.
</p><p>
I could use it as a portable electronic journal, but like my cell phone,
typing on the Ben NanoNote is slow. If I really want to record my thoughts
throughout the day, I would rather use a small paper notepad and pen.
</p><p>
So is the Ben NanoNote a useless gadget? Not at all. The thing that
attracted me to the Ben NanoNote, and that still fascinates me, is that in a
size I wouldn't have dreamed possible only a few years ago, I have a
&ldquo;real&rdquo; computer complete with a screen and a keyboard.
</p><p>
Real, of course, depends on a particular definition of the term. For me,
it means a computer with a usable command line, SSH and Vim, and the ability
to install new software and to run shell scripts.
</p><p>
Although I still haven't decided what I ultimately want to do with my Ben
NanoNote, I have thought of some tasks I might consider for it. One
idea is to use it as a monitoring device for my home server with the
internal speaker playing an alert if some preset condition is not met.
</p><p>
Another idea is to use it as an ultra-secure GPG encryption device. It's
practically impossible to break into something over the network when the
device you are trying to break into is not even connected to the network,
so the Ben NanoNote satisfies my tinfoil-hat tendencies. I would have to
be careful never to connect it to a computer, because anything connected
directly to the Internet is, or potentially could be, compromised. But,
with USB power adapters and the microSDHC slot (for getting files on
and off the device), this shouldn't be too hard. I also would have to
be careful to secure the device physically, but it's small enough that
it should fit into almost any safe.
</p><p>
Those are just two uses, and others are rolling around in the back
of my head. Some ideas have been discussed on the Qi Hardware Wiki or talked
about on the mailing list, but I'm sure many uses have not been thought
of yet.
</p><p>
The Ben NanoNote is not a device for passive consumers. It's
for developers, hackers and tinkerers. Why? Because the biggest thing
the Ben NanoNote provides is freedom&mdash;total freedom to do whatever
you want. There aren't any EULAs, encrypted and/or signed firmware
images, or other artificial locks standing in your way with the Ben
NanoNote. Play with it, hack it, break it, fix it, discover new uses,
rinse, repeat. The Ben NanoNote has a limited set of abilities, true,
but like the rules for haiku, it's what you do within, or in spite of,
the limitations that makes the difference.

Games on the NanoNote</b></p><p>
No geeky device of the last ten years has been considered much of anything if
you couldn't play id Software's first-person-shooter (FPS)
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DOOM</em></span> on it. The Ben
NanoNote is no different. I wouldn't call <span   class="emphasis"><em>DOOM</em></span> on the
NanoNote &ldquo;playable&rdquo;, but
you can walk around, shoot things and get through the various levels without
dying too much, provided the difficulty is set to
&ldquo;I'm too young to die.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, another FPS game from id Software, also can be run on the NanoNote. Again,
the usability is low (it's harder to play than <span   class="emphasis"><em>DOOM</em></span>),
but it does work in a slow, jerky sort of way.
</p><p>
A more usable game available for the Ben NanoNote, from the same developer who
provided the <span   class="emphasis"><em>DOOM</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span> binaries I
used, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frotz</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Frotz</em></span> is an interpreter
for Infocom-style text adventures (like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Zork</em></span>). There
are some issues with text wrapping weirdly with strange line breaks,
but the games I tried played fine.
