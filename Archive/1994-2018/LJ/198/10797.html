Distros come and go, and sometimes they combine with others to form
new distros. Take Intel's Moblin and combine it with Nokia's Maemo,
and you get MeeGo.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c02a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
On February 15, 2010, the world's largest chip manufacturer, Intel, and
the world's largest mobile handset manufacturer, Nokia, announced joining
their existing open-source projects (Moblin and Maemo, respectively) to
form a new project called MeeGo, hosted at the Linux Foundation. This
article provides an introduction to the MeeGo Project, a brief overview
of the MeeGo architecture, the benefits the MeeGo platform offers to 
various players in the ecosystem and discusses the role of the Linux
Foundation as the project's host.
</p><p>
MeeGo is a Linux-based platform that is capable of running on multiple
computing devices, including handsets, Netbooks,
tablets, connected TVs and in-vehicle infotainment systems.
The primary goal of the Maemo and Moblin Projects' merger was to
unify the Moblin and Maemo communities' efforts and enable a
next-generation open-source Linux platform suited for a variety of client devices.
Most important, MeeGo will be doing this while maintaining freedom for
innovation, continuing the tradition of community involvement (inherited
from Maemo and Moblin), accelerating time to market for a new set of
applications, services and user experiences.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
MeeGo is a full open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation and
governed according to best practices of open-source development. As with
other true open-source projects, technical decisions are made based on
technical merit of the code contributions being made.&mdash;Ari Jaaksi,
Vice President of MeeGo Devices, Nokia.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
With the merger, the MeeGo Project has the opportunity to 
expand market opportunities significantly on a wide range of devices. It also
will provide a rich cross-platform development environment, so applications can
span multiple platforms. Additionally, it will unify developers, providing a wealth of
applications and services. Such opportunities were out of reach for Maemo and
Moblin individually. MeeGo will support multiple chip architectures (ARM and
x86). Furthermore, with hundreds of developers working in the open on
upstream projects first, from which MeeGo will be based, other mobile Linux
platforms will benefit from MeeGo's contributions.

Maemo Background</b></p><p>
The Maemo Project, initially created by Nokia (<a href="http://www.maemo.org" target="_self">www.maemo.org</a>), 
provided a Linux-based software stack that runs on mobile devices.
The Maemo platform is built in large part with open-source components, and
its SDK provides an open development environment for applications on top
of the Maemo platform. A series of Nokia Internet tablets with touchscreens
have been built with the Maemo platform. The latest Maemo device is the Nokia N900
powered by Maemo 5, which introduced a completely redesigned finger-touch UI,
cellular phone feature and live multicasting on the Maemo dashboard.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c0880"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Moblin Background</b></p><p>
The Moblin Project, short for Mobile Linux, is Intel's open-source initiative
(<a href="http://www.moblin.org" target="_self">www.moblin.org</a>) created to develop software for smartphones, Netbooks,
mobile Internet devices (MIDs), in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems
and other mobile devices. It is an optimized Linux-based platform for small
computing devices. It runs on the Intel Atom, an inexpensive chip with low
power requirements. A device running Moblin boots up quickly and can be
on-line within a few seconds.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c0ae8"></a>
MeeGo Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
MeeGo provides a full open-source software stack from the core operating system
up to the user interface libraries and tools. Furthermore, it offers user experience
(UX) reference implementations and allows proprietary add-ons to be added
by vendors to support hardware, services or customized user experiences.
Figure 1 illustrates the MeeGo architecture, which is divided into three layers:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The MeeGo OS Base layer consists of the hardware adaptation software
required to adapt MeeGo to support various hardware architectures and
the Linux kernel and core services.
</p></li><li><p>
The MeeGo OS Middleware layer provides a hardware and usage model-independent
API for building both native applications and Web runtime applications.
</p></li><li><p>
The MeeGo User Experience (UX) layer provides reference user experiences
for multiple platform segments. The first UX reference implementation
was released on May 25, 2010, for the Netbook UX. Other UX reference
implementations will follow for additional supported device types.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
A detailed discussion of the MeeGo software platform is available at
<a href="http://meego.com/developers/MeeGo-architecture" target="_self">meego.com/developers/MeeGo-architecture</a>.

Figure 1. MeeGo Component-Level Architecture Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
As mentioned earlier, the Netbook UX was the first reference implementation of
a UX to become available for MeeGo. It delivers a wealth of Internet, computing
and communication experiences with rich graphics, multitasking and multimedia
capabilities, and it's highly optimized for power and performance. You can download the
MeeGo Netbook images from <a href="http://meego.com" target="_self">meego.com</a>, and run MeeGo on your Netbook.
Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the Netbook UX featuring
the MeeGo MyZone (the home screen).

Benefits of the MeeGo Project</h2></div></div><p>
The MeeGo open-source project is unique in that it offers benefits to everyone
in the ecosystem, starting from the developer all the way up to the operator
and the industry as a whole. MeeGo allows participants to get involved and
contribute to an industry-wide evolution toward richer devices to 
address opportunities rapidly and to focus on differentiation in their target markets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c1430"></a>
Benefits to Open-Source Developers</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned previously, the MeeGo Project is a true open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation
and governed by best practices of open-source development. From MeeGo.com,
as an open-source developer, you have access to tools, mailing lists and a
discussion forum. You also have
accessibility to technical meetings and multiple options for making your voice
heard in technical and nontechnical MeeGo-related topics. Furthermore, all
source code contributions needed for MeeGo will be submitted to the upstream
open-source projects from which MeeGo will be built (Figure 3).

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c16f0"></a>
Benefits to Application Developers</h2></div></div><p>
As an application developer, MeeGo significantly expands your market opportunities, as it is the only open-source software platform that supports deployments
across many computing device types. MeeGo offers Qt and Web runtime for
application development and cross-platform environments, so application developers
can write their applications once and deploy easily on many types of MeeGo
devices or even on other platforms supporting the same development environment.
Furthermore, MeeGo will offer a complete set of tools for developers to
create a variety of innovative applications easily and
rapidly
(see <a href="http://meego.com/developers/getting-started" target="_self">meego.com/developers/getting-started</a>). The major advantage from
this approach (Figure 4) is having a single set of APIs across client devices.
In addition, in this context, &ldquo;multiple devices&rdquo; means much
more than just
multiple types of handsets, for instance. MeeGo device types include
media phones, handhelds, IVI systems, connected TVs and Netbooks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10797f4.large.jpg"><img src="10797f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. MeeGo Apps Available from Multiple App Stores for a Wide Range of Device Types
</p></div></div><p>
In addition, MeeGo application developers will have the opportunity to make their
applications available from multiple application stores, such as Nokia's
Ovi Store (<a href="https://store.ovi.com" target="_self">https://store.ovi.com</a>) and Intel's AppUp
Center (<a href="http://www.intel.com/consumer/products/appup.htm" target="_self">www.intel.com/consumer/products/appup.htm</a>). 
Also, there is the opportunity to host the applications on other
app stores for specific carriers offering MeeGo devices as part of their
device portfolios. These MeeGo capabilities and cross-device and cross-platform
development are major differentiators and offer huge benefits to application developers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c1b68"></a>
Benefits to Device Manufacturers</h2></div></div><p>
MeeGo helps accelerate time to market using an off-the-shelf, open-source
and optimized software stack targeted for the specific hardware architecture
the device manufacturer is supporting. From a device manufacturer perspective,
MeeGo lowers complexities involved in targeting multiple device segments
by allowing the use of the same software platform for different client devices.
In addition, as an open-source project, MeeGo enables device manufacturers to
participate in the evolution of the software platform and build their
own assets for it through the open development model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x23c1c70"></a>
Benefits to Operators</h2></div></div><p>
MeeGo enables differentiation through user
interface customization. Although
many devices can be running the same base software platform, they all
can have different user experiences. Furthermore, it provides a single platform
for a multitude of devices, minimizing the efforts needed by the operators/carriers
in training their teams, which allows their subscribers to be familiar
with the experience common to many device types.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x27ba020"></a>
Benefits to the Linux Platform</h2></div></div><p>
MeeGo is a vehicle for fostering mobile innovations through an open collaborative
environment, promoting the exchange of ideas and source code, peer review, unifying
development from across multiple device categories and driving contributions
and technical work upstream to various open-source projects.
</p><p>
In addition, MeeGo contributes to Linux as a technical platform, as it combines
mobile development resources that recently were split in the Maemo and Moblin Projects
into one well-supported, well-designed project that addresses cross-platform,
cross-device and cross-architecture development. 
Dozens of traditional Linux mobile and desktop efforts use many of the components
used by MeeGo. They all benefit from the increased engineering efforts on
those components. This is the power of the open-source development model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c8580.0x27ba180"></a>
The Linux Foundation and MeeGo</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux Foundation (<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org" target="_self">www.linuxfoundation.org</a>) hosts the MeeGo Project
as an open-source project, provides a vendor-neutral collaboration environment
and encourages community contributions in line with the best practices of
the open-source development model.
</p><p>
The Linux Foundation and MeeGo meet on various key points:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Accelerating the adoption of Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
Promoting collaboration between industry players and the Open Source
community.
</p></li><li><p>
Unifying divergent efforts toward the benefits of a strong Linux platform.
</p></li><li><p>
Promoting a truly open Linux platform and improving Linux as a technical
platform.
</p></li><li><p>
Encouraging companies to drive their contributions and technical work
upstream.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As owner of the MeeGo trademark, the Linux Foundation also is driving the
creation of a MeeGo compliance program that will allow ISVs and OSVs to go
through the compliance program and have their applications, distributions,
devices and so on certified as MeeGo-compliant. Figure 5 illustrates the benefits
of the compliance program to various players in the MeeGo ecosystem.
MeeGo will enable applications developed with the MeeGo API to run on all devices
running MeeGo-compliant OSes with segment-specific adaptations.
</p><p>
The Linux Foundation contributes to the MeeGo Project through its coordination efforts,
overseeing MeeGo events; hosting a number of MeeGo-related technologies, services
and collaboration tools; in addition to various marketing, legal, PR and
other support activities. Furthermore, the Linux Foundation employs the
maintainers of the cross-toolchain used by MeeGo and contributes the
optimizations for multi-architecture support in the build service.
