DirB, Directory Bookmarks for Bash

Inspired by browser bookmarks, DirB allows you to create
directory bookmarks for moving around faster on the command line.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x246b300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Imagine browsing the Web and having to type the full Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) path each time you visit a Web page&mdash;painful. However,
since 1993, when browser bookmarks were added to the Mosaic browser, they
have made short work of returning to sites you go to often (see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bookmark" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bookmark</a>).
Regardless of whether you call them &ldquo;Bookmarks&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Favorites&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hotlists&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Internet Shortcuts&rdquo;, they are great time-savers.
</p><p>
As a developer of consumer product software, I frequently work concurrently
in multiple directory trees. I often bounce between the source
code directories for each of my active development products, the
directories that hold vendor documentation, and my desktop (where
I keep all my active but as-of-yet unfiled work). I used to open a separate
xterm window for each active directory, but mousing between the various
windows and keeping track of which window had what directory was tedious
and error-prone.
</p><p>
If command-line bookmarks existed, they would transport me to
often-visited directories with a few keystrokes. Of course, the Linux
change directory command (cd) comes with one built-in shortcut: the one
to go to your home directory. To go home, I need to enter only the
<tt  >cd</tt>
command without an argument. It's even easier than clicking the heels
of my ruby slippers (which is not an unrelated reference to a popular scripting
language,
but instead a spurious reference to <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></span>).
But, this is where the convenience ends.
</p><p>
I created Directory Bookmarks (DirB, pronounced &ldquo;derby&rdquo;) to extend the
concept of bookmarks to the command line and to move between
directories quickly. DirB is implemented as a set of Bash shell functions and
consists of a few simple commands:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >s</tt> &mdash; save a directory bookmark.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >g</tt> &mdash; go to a bookmark or named directory.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >p</tt> &mdash; push bookmark/directory onto dir stack.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >r</tt> &mdash; remove a saved bookmark.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >d</tt> &mdash; display a bookmarked directory path.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >sl</tt> &mdash; print the list of directory bookmarks.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These commands can be used alongside the usual Bash commands:
<tt  >cd</tt>, <tt  >pushd</tt>
and <tt  >popd</tt>.
</p><p>
As you will see, DirB means fewer keystrokes and greater
productivity. Now, I (almost) never leave home without it.
</p><p>
If DirB's function names conflict with commands or aliases that
you already use, change the names of the offending functions in the
.bashDirB file to ones that work for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x246c170"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
To install DirB, download the source file .bashDirB from
<a href="http://www.DirB.info/bashDirB" target="_self">www.DirB.info/bashDirB</a>,
and save it as ~/.bashDirB to your
home directory. Then, edit your ~/.bashrc file and include the following
in the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
source ~/.bashDirB
</pre>
</p><p>
Each new Bash session now will have the power of DirB. If you use the
DirB commands within the ~/.bashrc file, place the
<tt  >source</tt> line
above where the DirB commands are used. I find that placing this near
the top of the file works for me.
</p><p>
After installing DirB, open a new xterm window and follow along with
the rest of this article.
</p><p>
DirB comes with a small bonus. When working in multiple windows at the
same time, I find it handy to have each xterm window display the current
directory's name in its title bar. To accomplish this, the .bashDirB
file sets up the primary Bash shell prompt, $PS1, to output an escape
sequence. This string then will be output as part of the command-line
prompt, and the X11 windowing software will respond to the escape sequence
by updating the xterm window's title bar. If you are not using X11,
or if this behavior is not desired, edit ~/.bashDirB and insert
a pound sign (#) in front of the <tt  >PS1=</tt> on line 18 of the file to
comment out that feature.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x246c4e0"></a>
Saving and Using Bookmarks</h2></div></div><p>
The desktop is one of my most common destinations. I saved a bookmark
for my desktop by going there and then entering an <tt  >s</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd ~/Desktop
% s d
</pre>
</p><p>
(Note that the <tt  >%</tt> represents the shell's command-line prompt and is
not typed as part of the command.) The second line above creates a
new bookmark named d.
</p><p>
Wherever I am, I now can go to my desktop with the <tt  >g</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /tmp   # go somewhere
% pwd
/tmp
% g d       # go to the desktop
% pwd
/home/Desktop
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x246c850"></a>
Going to a Specified Directory</h2></div></div><p>
Now it's possible to move to a directory using <tt  >cd</tt> or
<tt  >g</tt>. Wouldn't it
be simpler to have one way that worked for both bookmarks and directory
paths? Of course it would. So, DirB's <tt  >g</tt> command has been extended to
be able to replace <tt  >cd</tt> fully:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% pwd
/home/Desktop
% g /tmp
% pwd
/tmp
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >g</tt> command behaves the same as the
<tt  >cd</tt> command if the first
character of the argument is a period (.) or if the argument is not the
name of a saved bookmark. The special case of the first character being
a period allows you to move to a current subdirectory that has the same
name as a previously saved bookmark:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /tmp
% mkdir d
% g ./d
% pwd
/tmp/d
</pre>
</p><p>
If you use the command: <tt  >g d</tt> instead of <tt  >g
./d</tt> above, DirB takes you
to your desktop, as a bookmark for the desktop with the name of d
already exists.
</p><p>
If the argument to <tt  >g</tt> is the relative or absolute path of a directory
and there is no bookmark by that name, you are taken to the specified path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /tmp
% mkdir subdir
% g subdir
% pwd
/tmp/subdir
</pre>
</p><p>
As with the <tt  >cd</tt> command, if you enter the
<tt  >g</tt> command without an
argument, you go to your home directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /tmp
% g
% pwd
/home
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x2865230"></a>
Traveling with Relatives</h2></div></div><p>
Most of the source code directories I work in are organized with the
same layout. From the application's source code directory, I frequently
need to refer to header files in my standard library.
These headers are located two directories up and two directories down in
the filesystem: ../../stdlib/inc.
</p><p>
DirB can save relative bookmarks or bookmarks of
any specified path. It is
not necessary to be in the directory to be bookmarked. A longer version
of the <tt  >s</tt> command can be used to specify a bookmark's path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g projA
% pwd
/home/projectA/source/application/main
% s stdh ../../stdlib/inc
% g stdh
% pwd
/home/projectA/source/stdlib/inc
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the relative bookmark has been created with the <tt  >s</tt> command, relative
movements can be made easily from anywhere that the relative path exists:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g projB
% pwd
/home/projectB/source/application/main
% g stdh
% pwd
/home/projectB/source/application/main
</pre>
</p><p>
This longer version of the <tt  >s</tt> command sets a full path directory bookmark
without changing to the target directory first:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g projA
% pwd
/home/projectA/source/application/main
% s t /tmp
% pwd
/home/projectA/source/application/main
% d t
/tmp
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the current working directory was not changed by the
<tt  >s</tt>
command and that the bookmark was set to the argument of the
<tt  >s</tt> command
and not the current directory. The bookmark can be used later, the same
as simpler bookmarks:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g t
% pwd
/tmp
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x2865808"></a>
Manipulating the Directory Stack</h2></div></div><p>
As the <tt  >g</tt> command extends Bash's built-in
<tt  >cd</tt> command, DirB has the <tt  >p</tt>
command to extend the shell's <tt  >pushd</tt> command and also replaces the
most common usage of the shell's <tt  >popd</tt> command.
</p><p>
In its most-used form, the <tt  >p</tt> command changes to a new directory,
while remembering the current directory on a stack. The state of the
directory stack then is printed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g
% pwd
/home
% p /tmp
/tmp
~
</pre>
</p><p>
The tilde (~) is Bash's shortcut for the home directory. The target
just as easily can be a bookmark:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% p d
~/Desktop
/tmp
~
</pre>
</p><p>
The directory stack listing is done with one directory per line, instead
of the default listing style of <tt  >pushd</tt> with all the directories printed
across the line. This is a personal preference and is accomplished by
discarding the output from the invoked <tt  >pushd</tt> command and then running a
<tt  >dirs -p</tt> command afterward.
</p><p>
Except for bookmark targets and the target dash (-), the
<tt  >p</tt> command
works just as Bash's <tt  >pushd</tt> command. In fact, all the real work
is accomplished, behind the scenes, by <tt  >pushd</tt>. So the
normal <tt  >pushd</tt>
behavior, as well as the enhanced bookmark functionality, is valid
(and useful):

<pre     class="programlisting">
% p directory   # adds dir to top of dir stack
% p bookmark    # adds bookmark to dir stack
% p             # swaps top two stack entries
% p +n          # rotate nth entry from top to top
% p -n          # rotate nth entry from bottom to top
</pre>
</p><p>
To rotate the directory stack, so that the bottom directory moves to the
top of the stack as the current directory, use <tt  >p -0</tt>. In addition to
replacing <tt  >pushd</tt>, the <tt  >p</tt> command
also can replace the shell's <tt  >popd</tt>
command in its simplest form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g
% pwd
/home
% p /tmp
/tmp
~
% p -
~
</pre>
</p><p>
If the full functionality of the <tt  >popd</tt> command is needed, the standard
<tt  >popd</tt> command (along with <tt  >pushd</tt>
and <tt  >cd</tt>) still is available and can
be used alongside the DirB commands.
</p><p>
To get a listing of the current directory stack, the shell's
<tt  >dirs</tt>
command works as it did before DirB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x2866468"></a>
Listing the Saved Bookmarks</h2></div></div><p>
DirB's <tt  >sl</tt> command prints a saved bookmark listing. It has two forms. The
simplest form lists the files across the line, from left to right,
in reverse time order, most recently accessed bookmark first:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sl
d test prod tmp beta alpha
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, the bookmark for my desktop, d, was accessed most
recently.
</p><p>
In the longer form, <tt  >sl</tt> lists the date and time that each bookmark was
last referenced:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sl -l
2010-03-10 14:42 d
2010-03-01 14:19 test
2010-02-27 10:17 prod
2010-02-27 14:21 tmp
2009-10-22 17:26 beta
2009-08-05 11:37 alpha
</pre>
</p><p>
In this fuller listing, you can see that the d bookmark was
referenced on March 10th, and the last time that the test bookmark
was referenced was nine days earlier. If the long listing
does not fit on a screen, the <tt  >less</tt> command will 
page through the listing automatically.
</p><p>
It is possible to pass a regular expression to <tt  >sl</tt> and
list only the
matching bookmarks. To list the saved bookmarks that begin with the letter t:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sl "t*"
test  tmp
% sl -l "t*"
2010-03-10 14:19 test
2010-02-27 14:21 tmp
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the regular expression needs to be protected by double (or single) quotes
to prevent the shell from trying to expand it before it is seen by the
<tt  >sl</tt> command.
</p><p>
Whenever a bookmark is the target of a <tt  >g</tt>,
<tt  >p</tt> or <tt  >s</tt> command, its
timestamp is updated to record the reference. However, timestamps are
not updated when a directory is accessed using <tt  >cd</tt>,
<tt  >pushd</tt> or by
directory stack manipulations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x2866bf8"></a>
Removing Stale Bookmarks</h2></div></div><p>
Directory bookmarks are so easy to make that I create them
frequently. Many of my bookmarks are short-lived. If left unchecked,
the saved bookmark listing would become very long and cluttered. DirB's
<tt  >r</tt> command simplifies the removal of unwanted bookmarks:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sl
test  prod  d  tmp  beta  alpha
% r alpha
% sl
test  prod  d  tmp  beta
</pre>
</p><p>
The second saved bookmark listing shows that the <tt  >r
alpha</tt> removed the
unwanted alpha bookmark.
</p><p>
DirB or the underlying Bash commands issue error messages when a
problem is encountered. Accessing a deleted bookmark results in such
a message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% g alpha
bash: cd: alpha: No such file or directory
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the error message issued when a bookmark does not exist, possibly
due to a misspelling.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x2866f68"></a>
Using Bookmarks in Scripts</h2></div></div><p>
Bookmarks save keystrokes and allow for fast movement between
directories. Bookmarks also can be used to make
scripts more portable. By
referencing bookmarks, instead of fixed paths, it is possible to 
re-use scripts in different environments easily. I work on both Linux and
Cygwin platforms. (Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows platforms. For more
information, or to download Cygwin, see <a href="http://www.cygwin.com" target="_self">www.cygwin.com</a>.)
Because Cygwin presents a very Linux-like
look and feel, the transitions are painless. However, the Linux and Cygwin
directory structures are different. I use DirB to set up the same list of
common bookmarks on each system. This way, I can change between directories
on the command line with the same keystrokes, regardless of the platform.
</p><p>
In addition to Linux and Cygwin environments, DirB has been tested on BSD
UNIX and Mac OS X platforms. So, the flexibility of DirB bookmark
references can span across a variety of systems.
</p><p>
The <tt  >d</tt> command extends the DirB facility to shell scripts. (The d
is short for either &ldquo;display bookmark path&rdquo; or &ldquo;dereference bookmark
path&rdquo;, your choice.) It allows a script to obtain the full pathname of
a bookmark's directory.
</p><p>
Bash's command substitution <tt  >$(command)</tt> feature usually
is used to access <tt  >d</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% DTOP="$(d d)"
% echo $DTOP
/home/Desktop
</pre>
</p><p>
The double quotes need to surround the shell substitution in case there
are spaces in the directory path. Unfortunately, this is all too common
on the Windows-based Cygwin platform, so I always use the quotes. In
the above example, the shell variable <tt  >$DTOP</tt> could be used to access the
desktop. To create a new log file on the desktop, the output of a command
could be redirected to <tt  >$DTOP/logfile</tt>. Do not forget the double quotes,
in case the dereferenced path includes spaces.
</p><p>
I recommend the use of Bash's substitution feature, as shown
above. However, a shorter way to print out the name of the path is to
use DirB's <tt  >d</tt> command directly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% d d
/home/Desktop
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x277a1d8"></a>
Looking behind the Curtain</h2></div></div><p>
DirB keeps all directory bookmarks in ~/.DirB, a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; subdirectory
of the user's home directory. When the file ~/.bashDirB is sourced from
within ~/.bashrc, it checks to see whether the ~/.DirB directory exists. If
the directory does not exist, it is created. This guarantees that the
bookmark repository exists.
</p><p>
Each bookmark has an associated file in the ~/.DirB directory with the
same name as the bookmark. The bookmark file contains a one-line command,
such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$CD /home/Desktop
</pre>
</p><p>
The shell variable $CD is set by the <tt  >g</tt> and
<tt  >p</tt> commands to <tt  >cd</tt> or
<tt  >pushd</tt>, respectively, and the variable is expanded by the shell when the
bookmark is invoked. In essence, the command <tt  >g d</tt> is transformed into
<tt  >cd /home/Desktop</tt>, and <tt  >p d</tt> is
transformed into <tt  >pushd /home/Desktop</tt>.
</p><p>
The DirB commands are implemented as Bash functions that do some error checking, determine which action is to be performed, and then invoke a
standard command. For example, the <tt  >g</tt> command does a couple checks
before invoking the <tt  >cd</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# "g" - Go to bookmark
function g () {
    # if no arguments, go to the home directory
    if [ -z "$1" ]
    then
        cd
    else
        # if $1 is in ~/.DirB and does not
        # begin with ".", then go to it
        if [ -f ~/.DirB/"$1"
            -a ${1:0:1} != "." ]
        then
            # update the bookmark's timestamp a
            # and then execute it
            touch ~/.DirB/"$1" ;
            CD=cd source ~/.DirB/"$1" ;
        else
            # else just "cd" to the argument,
            # usually a directory path of "-"
            cd "$1"
        fi
    fi
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The function <tt  >g</tt> checks to see whether there is an
argument. If $1 is a zero-length string, the user is sent home with a
<tt  >cd</tt> invoked with no
argument. Otherwise, a check is made to see if the argument is the name of
a saved bookmark and the first character of the argument is not a period.
</p><p>
If both conditions are met, the bookmark is run as part of the
current shell by sourcing the bookmark file. Before execution, the shell
variable <tt  >$CD</tt> is set to the <tt  >cd</tt>
command. <tt  >source</tt> is used instead
of calling the bookmark as a shell script so that the directory change
will affect the current shell. A called script would have a unique shell
session that would terminate after the <tt  >cd</tt> or
<tt  >pushd</tt>. Thus, it would
have no lasting effect on the current shell session.
</p><p>
If the argument is not the name of a bookmark, or if it begins with a
period, the <tt  >cd</tt> command is invoked with the argument to go to the
specified directory path.
</p><p>
Note that the <tt  >source</tt> command in the
<tt  >g</tt> function above starts
with a variable assignment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CD=cd source ~/.DirB/"$1" ;
</pre>
</p><p>
Bash syntax allows a command to be preceded by one or more variable assignments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2373580.0x277ade0"></a>
Error Handling</h2></div></div><p>
Most DirB commands eventually call <tt  >cd</tt>,
<tt  >pushd</tt> or <tt  >popd</tt> to perform
the requested action. If one of these standard commands encounters
a problem, it issues an error message to the standard error (stderr)
stream and exits with a failing return code.
</p><p>
Note that because bookmarks are the names of their associated files in
the ~/.DirB repository, they cannot have slashes in their names. If a
bookmark cannot be created (most likely due an invalid character in the
name), <tt  >s</tt> will print an error message to the standard error:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% s a/d
bash: DirB: /home/.DirB/a/b could not be created
</pre>
</p><p>
An error message will result if an argument to either
<tt  >g</tt>
or <tt  >p</tt> is
neither a bookmark nor a valid directory path:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% p missing
bash: pushd: missing: No such file or directory
</pre>
</p><p>
This will occur if the bookmark name is misspelled or if the bookmark
has been removed. A similar error message results from the
<tt  >d</tt> and <tt  >r</tt>
commands if their arguments are not valid names of a saved bookmark:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% d missing
bash: DirB: /home/.DirB/missing does not exist
% r missing
bash: DirB: /home/.DirB/missing does not exist
</pre>
</p><p>
If an error is encountered, DirB commands will exit with a failing return
code. This behavior allows other Bash scripts to use these functions
and take appropriate action in the event of an error.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
DirB was created as a set of Bash functions to extend the concepts of
bookmarks to Linux directories. It accelerates the movement between
frequently accessed directories from the command line or from shell
scripts. Although it's a simple tool, I rely upon DirB daily and hope that others
will find it useful too.
