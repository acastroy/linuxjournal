Use cross-platform applications and shared data for the ultimate
Linux/Windows system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x18151e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently converted my Toshiba notebook computer into a dual-boot system,
running Windows XP Pro and Ubuntu Linux. I was hoping I'd be able to use
cross-platform applications such as Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird,
AbiWord, Gnumeric and SciTE transparently, no matter which operating
system was currently booted. This article describes the steps I took to
make this possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x18152f0"></a>
Dual-Boot Computer Configuration for Shared Application Data</h2></div></div><p>
In what follows, I assume you already have a dual-boot computer that has
a working Linux and Windows operating system installed. You also must
have an adequately sized additional disk partition for storing shared
application data. This partition must be readable and writable by both
operating systems. FAT32 (VFAT) is the logical choice.
</p><p>
My notebook came with Windows XP Pro installed on a 30GB hard
drive. The computer was well used, its disk nearly filled, before I
decided to convert it to a dual-boot system. I offloaded lots of data,
and used the Windows defragment program to reduce my total Windows size
below 15GB. Then, I used utilities on the Linux System Rescue CD to
resize the original Windows partition and make new partitions as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Partition 1: Windows NTFS primary partition, 18.5GB.
</p></li><li><p>
Partition 2: Linux ext3 primary partition, 5GB.
</p></li><li><p>
Partition 3: Linux swap partition, 1GB.
</p></li><li><p>
Partition 4: FAT32 partition for shared application data, 5GB.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Making a dual-boot system with only 30GB of total disk space is
not ideal. My shared application data partition was 80% full once I
loaded my archived e-mail, working documents and various ongoing
cross-platform software development projects. For a more ideal setup, I
recommend at least 60&ndash;80GB of disk space. In that case, I'd allocate
20GB for Windows, 10GB for Linux, 1&ndash;2GB for Linux swap
and make the remainder the FAT32 shared partition.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x18157c0"></a>
Configuring and Accessing the Shared Disk Partition</h2></div></div><p>
Windows views a FAT32 partition as a separate disk drive and assigns
it a drive letter. The letter assigned depends on what storage devices
are connected to the system&mdash;for example, floppy or CD/DVD drives. On my
system, Windows identifies the FAT32 partition as drive E:. Use Windows
Explorer to verify the Windows drive letter for your FAT32 partition.
</p><p>
When I installed Ubuntu Linux, I selected mounting the FAT32 partition
at boot time, using the mountpoint /share. After Linux boots, you can
verify that the FAT32 partition is mounted with the UNIX df command
(Listing 1).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x1815920"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

/dev/hda4      4713876    417898   4295978  9% /share
</pre></div><p>
Although the /share partition is mounted, there is a problem. By default,
the the root user owns the /share partition. A standard user will
not have read or write permission, and will not be able to run
programs that access the shared data. Fortunately, the UNIX mount command
provides options for a partition to be mounted with ownership set to a
user other than root. This is one method for enabling you to read and
write the shared partition using your normal login.
</p><p>
If only one person uses the computer, or only one user needs access
to the shared partition, the best plan is to mount the /share partition
at boot time, but with your login provided with ownership and full
access rights. To configure this, you need to know your user ID and
group ID. The /etc/passwd file stores this information. Here's
the entry for my user name (kevin) in my /etc/passwd file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kevin@lyratoshibaubuntu:~$
cat /etc/passwd | grep kevin
kevin:x:1000:1000:kevin,,,:/home/kevin:/bin/bash
</pre>
</p><p>
The user ID is the number after the second colon. The group ID is the
number after the third colon. The example shows that user kevin is
assigned user ID 1000 and group ID 1000 on my system.
</p><p>
Now, you must edit the /etc/fstab file. This filesystem table
identifies the filesystems the booting Linux system can expect to see,
and instructs Linux on what actions to take for each filesystem. You
need to switch to the root user account to edit the file.
</p><p>
First, make a backup copy of the current working /etc/fstab file, so
you can revert to that version if something goes wrong. Next, bring the
fstab file into an editor, such as vi, emacs, gedit or scite. Find the
line for the /share file system, and change the data in the &lt;options&gt;
column to
<tt  >defaults,uid=<i>uuuu</i>,gid=<i>gggg</i></tt>
where <tt  ><i>uuuu</i></tt> and
<tt  ><i>gggg</i></tt> are your
user ID and group ID from /etc/passwd.
</p><p>
Your finished /etc/fstab file should look something like Listing 2.

</pre></div><p>
If multiple user accounts need to access the shared partition, you need a different
strategy. One option is not to mount the /share partition
at boot time, but instead make a script that users execute to mount
the partition giving themselves ownership and full access.
</p><p>
To disable mounting /share at boot time, edit /etc/fstab and place a
# at the start of the /share filesystem line. This makes the line
a comment. Then, find the user ID and group ID in /etc/passwd for each
user who requires full access to the /share partition. Finally, place
a script file similar to the following into the home directory of each
user, inserting each user's user ID and group ID after uid= and gid=,
respectively:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kevin@lyratoshibaubuntu:~$ cat mountShare.csh
sudo mount -t vfat -o uid=1000,gid=1000 /dev/hda4 /share
</pre>
</p><p>
After logging in to Linux, the user opens a terminal window and executes
the command script to mount the FAT32 partition with the needed access
settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash ./mountShare.csh
</pre>
</p><p>
However the shared partition is mounted, you can verify that you have
ownership and full access to the /share directory with a long listing
of path /:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kevin@lyratoshibaubuntu:~$ ls -l / | grep share
drwxr-xr-x   18 kevin kevin  4096 1969-12-31 19:00 share
</pre>

Using Your Shared Application Data Space</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, you are ready to use applications that run on both Windows
and Linux to do work on documents stored in your shared application data
space. If I'm working under Windows, I store and access my documents
using drive E:. Again, the drive letter for the FAT32 partition may be
different on your system. If I'm working under Linux, I store and access
the same documents in my /share partition.
</p><p>
Before you start editing documents, make sure you have the same version
of each application installed on Windows and Linux. Don't just hope
there are no configuration or data file structure changes between two
different releases of an application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x1816528"></a>
Mozilla Suite</h2></div></div><p>
I use Mozilla Firefox as my Web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird as my
e-mail client. Before I converted my notebook into a dual-boot system,
I had run Firefox for a long time, and it had many
bookmarks. I also had multiple years of saved e-mail messages. Naturally, with my
new dual-boot system, I wanted to run Firefox using all of my previously
saved bookmarks, and I wanted to be able to use Thunderbird transparently
in Windows and Linux, having full access to all my archived e-mail.
</p><p>
Is this possible? Thanks to the configuration strategy employed
by the Mozilla Suite developers, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;! Both Firefox
and Thunderbird organize their configurations via profiles. Each
profile is stored in its own subdirectory, which by default is located
beneath the top-level configuration directory for the application. The
name and location of each profile is stored in an index file named
profiles.ini. This structure gives us the flexibility to store the
configuration data for any profile in any disk location accessible to
the user&mdash;for example, on our FAT32 shared application data
partition.
</p><p>
Before you make any configuration changes, make sure Firefox and
Thunderbird are not running. Then, create a directory on the shared
partition where your Mozilla application configuration data will be
stored for access by both Windows and Linux. I chose to make a users
directory with a subdirectory named kevin, my user name under both
operating systems. This is convenient if I decide later to have multiple
users on the system. In that case, I'll make a separate path for each
user's unique configuration data, so that the logged in user accesses
and maintains his or her own configuration.
</p><p>
Under Windows, the path to my application configuration directory is
E:\users\kevin. Under Linux, the path is /share/users/kevin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x1816790"></a>
Mozilla Firefox Shared Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
For reference, I performed my Firefox shared configuration using Firefox
Version 1.5. However, the procedures also should work with 1.0.x versions
of Firefox.
</p><p>
My Windows Firefox installation contained all my personal bookmarks and
other configuration settings, so I reconfigured that Firefox first. In Windows,
find the Application Data directory for your user name beneath the
Documents and Settings directory. You should see a directory named
Firefox that has a subdirectory named Profiles. The Profiles
directory will have at least one subfolder. Here's how it looks on
my system:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8761f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Windows Firefox Application Data Folder Location and Structure
</p></div></div><p>
The profiles.ini file tells Firefox where to find its configuration
data. Open profiles.ini in an editor, and you should see something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[General]
StartWithLastProfile=0

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=1
Path=Profiles/z9qffpsf.default
Default=1
</pre>
</p><p>
This profiles.ini file identifies my configuration as having
a single profile, with the configuration data located in the folder
Profiles/z9qffpsf.default, relative to the directory where profiles.ini
is located. Looking at the folder tree in Figure 1, you can see the
Profiles/z9qffpsf.default folder, with various subfolders. This is the
location of all of my unique Firefox configuration information. This
is the data I want to be able to access (read and write), whether I am booted
in Windows or Linux. In your own Firefox installation, the *.default
folder will have a different name. You need to substitute the name
of your own profile directory as you perform the steps described below.
</p><p>
To make my configuration data available to both operating systems,
I made a Firefox\Profiles directory beneath my shared E:\users\kevin
directory, then copied the original Firefox Profiles\z9qffpsf.default
configuration directory to that path. Figure 2 shows the result.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8761f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Moved Firefox Configuration Directory
</p></div></div><p>
I renamed the original z9qffpsf.default directory on my C: drive to
maintain a backup copy in case of unanticipated disaster.
</p><p>
Next, I edited profiles.ini to point to the new location of the Firefox
configuration profile. I set the IsRelative flag to zero and the
Path location to the shared partition location where I copied
the configuration folder. When setting the path, make sure you use
Windows-style backslashes. Otherwise, Windows Firefox won't recognize
the new location. Here's my edited profiles.ini file:



<pre     class="programlisting">
[General]
StartWithLastProfile=0

[Profile1]
Name=default
IsRelative=0
Path=E:\users\kevin\Firefox\Profiles\ z9qffpsf.default
</pre>
</p><p>
I saved a copy of this file as profiles_new.ini, so I could return to
it in case something went wrong on my first try.
</p><p>
When you've got all of this complete, launch Firefox. If a window pops
up asking if you want to import settings from another browser,
something is incorrect in your setup. In this case, Firefox will have
overwritten the profiles.ini file and created a new default configuration
directory. Check your backup copy of your new profiles.ini file and the
directory names on the shared partition, make any necessary corrections,
re-save your corrected profiles.ini file, and try launching Firefox
again. When you have all the configuration elements correct, Firefox
launches as it always did, with all of your bookmarks available.
</p><p>
Now, Linux Firefox must be configured to use the same profile. Boot
in to Linux and mount the shared partition using one of the described
methods. In Linux, Firefox stores the configuration files beneath a user's
home in directory .mozilla. Go into this directory, then into the
firefox subdirectory, and execute <tt  >ls -l</tt>. You'll see a profiles.ini
file, the pluginreg.dat file and a configuration profile subdirectory.
</p><p>
To make the Linux Firefox use the configuration profile that was
placed onto the shared partition, edit the profiles.ini file. Set the
IsRelative flag to zero, and set the Path to the correct /share
location. Here's my modified Linux profiles.ini file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[General]
StartWithLastProfile=1

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=0
Path=/share/users/kevin/Firefox/Profiles/ z9qffpsf.default
Default=1
</pre>
</p><p>
Start Firefox. If all is correct, you'll see your standard Firefox
session with all the bookmarks you originally stored using Windows
Firefox available. If this doesn't happen, check the profiles.ini
file again, make certain the /share partition is mounted correctly, with proper
ownership and permissions, and verify the exact path to the shared Firefox
configuration directory. Replace profiles.ini with your corrected version,
and launch Firefox again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x180d9c0"></a>
Mozilla Thunderbird Shared Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The configuration organization for Thunderbird is similar to that for
Firefox. For reference, I made my shared configuration using Thunderbird
Version 1.0.7.
</p><p>
In Windows, find the Thunderbird directory beneath Application Data
in the Documents and Settings directory tree for your user name. You
might think the Thunderbird directory would be beneath Mozilla, parallel
to the Firefox directory, but this wasn't the case on my system. In the
Thunderbird directory, you'll see the familiar profiles.ini file and a
Profiles folder, as with Firefox.
</p><p>
To make all of your stored e-mail accessible from both your Windows and
Linux installations, the configuration folder must be moved to the
shared partition. I made a directory \users\kevin\Thunderbird on my
shared partition and copied the Profiles directory from the default
Windows location into the new shared directory. In my case, the view
from Windows Explorer looks like Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8761f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Moved Windows Thunderbird Configuration Directory
</p></div></div><p>
I renamed my original configuration directory to have a backup and
also to be certain that it would no longer be accessed by my operational
Windows Thunderbird.
</p><p>
Next, I changed the profiles.ini file to point to the new Thunderbird
application data location. My initial profiles.ini looked like this:



<pre     class="programlisting">
[General]
StartWithLastProfile=1

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=1
Path=Profiles/19ximc3t.default
</pre>
</p><p>
I changed IsRelative to zero and set Path to the new Thunderbird
location on the shared partition, switching the path directory separators
to Windows standard backslashes. Here's my modified file:



<pre     class="programlisting">
[General]
StartWithLastProfile=1

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=0
Path=e:\users\kevin\Thunderbird\Profiles\ 19ximc3t.default
</pre>
</p><p>
When you've done all of this, start Thunderbird. If everything has been
modified correctly, Thunderbird starts normally. If the configuration
is not correct, Thunderbird will ask about creating a new profile. In this
case, cancel and exit the program, check your new profile.ini file and
the location of the Thunderbird files on the shared partition. Correct
any problems, then run Thunderbird again.
</p><p>
On Linux, you'll find the Thunderbird profiles.ini file in the directory
.mozilla-thunderbird, beneath your home directory. Edit profiles.ini
to identify the configuration you set up from Windows on the shared
partition as the profile Thunderbird should use. Again, set IsRelative
to zero and Path to the shared location. Here's my modified Linux
Thunderbird profiles.ini file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[General]
StartWithLastProfile=1

[Profile0]
Name=default
IsRelative=0
Path=/share/users/kevin/Thunderbird/Profiles/ 19ximc3t.default
Default=1
</pre>
</p><p>
Launch Thunderbird, and you should have full access to all your e-mail
accounts and all the e-mail messages that were saved originally by Thunderbird
running on Windows. If Thunderbird asks about creating a new profile,
exit and check your work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x171d580.0x180e048"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Having a dual-boot Linux and Windows notebook is convenient. The
convenience is extended by sharing application data between both
operating systems. Being able to run Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird
transparently from both Linux and Windows further enhances a dual-boot
system's versatility.
</p><p>
Although a large number of steps are required to create the shared
configuration, the individual steps are not difficult for someone familiar
with locating, copying and editing files and directory structures in
both the Windows and Linux operating systems.
