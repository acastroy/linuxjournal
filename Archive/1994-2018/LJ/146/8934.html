Which comes first, the kernel chicken or the user-space egg?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeb0580.0xfa8298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've always been intrigued by the distinctions between <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel
space</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>user space</em></span>. At the technical level, the distinction is largely
between memory spaces: one where the kernel executes and provides
services, and one where user processes run. As a rule, it's safer to
run something in user space when it is possible, because user-space
processes can't mess with the critical parts of the operating system.
At a conceptual level, however, there also seems to be a distinction
between <span   class="emphasis"><em>usefulness</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span>.
</p><p>
I didn't start to see that distinction until I spent a week in October
2005
on a Linux Lunacy Geek Cruise with Andrew Morton, Ted Ts'o and a bunch
of other kernel hackers. Andrew and Ted gave a number of talks, and I
got a chance to spend additional time interviewing Andrew at length. As
a result, I came to the conclusion that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux is a
species</em></span>, and
unpacked that metaphor in a Cruise Report on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site
in November. Here's the gist of it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Kernel development is not about Moore's Law. It's about natural
selection, which is reactive, not proactive. Every patch to the
kernel is adaptive, responding to changes in the environment as well
as to internal imperatives toward general improvements on what the
species is and does.
</p><p>
We might look at each patch, each new kernel version, even the
smallest incremental ones, as a generation slightly better equipped
for the world than its predecessors. Look at each patch
submission&mdash;or each demand from a vendor that the kernel adapt to
suit its needs in some way&mdash;as input from the environment to which
the kernel might adapt.
</p><p>
We might look at the growth of Linux as that of a successful species
that does a good job of adapting, thanks to a reproductive cycle
that shames fruit flies. Operating systems, like other digital life
forms, reproduce exuberantly. One cp command or Ctrl-D, and you've
got a copy, ready to go&mdash;often into an environment where the species
might be improved some more, patch by patch. As the population of
the species grows and more patches come in, the kernel adapts and
improves.
</p><p>
These adaptations are reactive more often than proactive. This is
even, or perhaps especially, true for changes that large companies
want. Companies such as IBM and HP, for example, might like to see
proactive changes made to the kernel to better support their
commercial applications.
</p><p>
Several years ago, I had a conversation with a Microsoft executive
who told me that Linux had become a project of large commercial
vendors, because so many kernel maintainers and contributors were
employed by those vendors. Yet Andrew went out of his way to make
clear, without irony, that the symbiosis between large vendors and
the Linux kernel puts no commercial pressure on the kernel
whatsoever. Each symbiote has its own responsibilities. To
illustrate, he gave the case of one large company application:
&ldquo;The [application] team doesn't want to implement [something] until
it's available in the kernel. One of the reasons I'd be
reluctant to implement it in the kernel is that they haven't
demonstrated that it's a significant benefit to serious
applications. They haven't done the work to demonstrate that it
will benefit applications. They're saying, 'We're not going to
do the work if it's not in the kernel.' And I'm saying, 'I want
to see that it will benefit the kernel if we put it in.'&rdquo;
</p><p>
He added, &ldquo;On the kernel team, we are concerned about the long-term
viability and integrity of the code base. We're reluctant to put
stuff in for specific reasons where a commercial company might do
that.&rdquo; He says there is an &ldquo;organic process&rdquo; involved in vendor
participation in the kernel.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It made my year when Greg Kroah-Hartman (a top-rank kernel maintainer)
called this &ldquo;one of the most insightful descriptions about what the
Linux kernel really is, and how it is being changed over
time&rdquo;.
</p><p>
A few weeks ago, I was talking with Don Marti about how all open-source
projects seem to have the same kind of division between kernel space and
user space&mdash;between code and dependencies on that code. It was in that
conversation that I realized the main distinction was between usefulness
and use. Roles as well as purposes were involved. Only developers
contribute code. The influence of users, or even &ldquo;usability
experts&rdquo;, is
minimized by the meritocracy that comprises the development team. &ldquo;Show
me the code&rdquo; is a powerful filter.
</p><p>
Most imperatives of commercial development originate and live in user
space. These include selling products, making profits and adding
product features that drive future sales. None of these motivations are
of much (if any) interest to kernel development. Again, kernel
development is reactive, not proactive. For companies building on Linux,
the job is putting Linux to use, not telling it how to be useful.
Unless, of course, you have useful code to contribute. (Greg
Kroah-Hartman has put together an excellent set of recommendations. See
the on-line Resources for links.)
</p><p>
A few tradeshows ago, Dan Frye of IBM told me it took years for IBM to
discover that the company needed to adapt to its kernel developers,
rather than vice versa. I am sure other employers of kernel developers
have been making the same adjustments. How long before the rest of the
world follows? And what will the world learn from that adjustment that
it doesn't know now?
</p><p>
I began to see an answer take shape at O'Reilly's Emerging Technology
conference in March 2006. I was sitting in the audience, writing and
rewriting this very essay, when George Dyson took the stage and blew my
mind. George grew up in Princeton, hanging around the Institute for
Advanced Study where his father, Freeman Dyson, worked with Godel,
Einstein, Turing, von Neumann and other legends in mathematics, physics
and computing. Today, George is a historian studying the work of those
same great minds, plus antecedents running back hundreds of years.
</p><p>
George's lecture, titled &ldquo;Turing's Cathedral&rdquo;, reviews the deep history of
computing, its supportive mathematics and the staging of a shift in
computing from the mechanical to the biological&mdash;one that von Neumann
had begun to expect when he died tragically in 1957 at the age of 53.
Here's how George approaches questions similar to the one that had been
on my mind:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
&ldquo;The whole human memory can be, and probably in a short time will
be, made accessible to every individual&rdquo;, wrote H. G. Wells in his
1938 prophecy <span   class="emphasis"><em>World Brain</em></span>. &ldquo;This new all-human cerebrum need not be
concentrated in any one single place. It can be reproduced exactly
and fully, in Peru, China, Iceland, Central Africa, or wherever else
seems to afford an insurance against danger and interruption. It can
have at once, the concentration of a craniate animal and the
diffused vitality of an amoeba.&rdquo; Wells foresaw not only the
distributed intelligence of the World Wide Web, but the
inevitability that this intelligence would coalesce, and that power,
as well as knowledge, would fall under its domain. &ldquo;In a universal
organization and clarification of knowledge and ideas...in the
evocation, that is, of what I have here called a World Brain...in
that and in that alone, it is maintained, is there any clear hope of
a really Competent Receiver for world affairs....We do not want
dictators, we do not want oligarchic parties or class rule, we want
a widespread world intelligence conscious of itself.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In the early 1950s, when mean time between memory failure was
measured in minutes, no one imagined that a system depending on
every bit being in exactly the right place at exactly the right time
could be scaled up by a factor of 10<sup  >13</sup> in size, and down by a
factor of 10<sup  >6</sup> in time. Von Neumann, who died prematurely in 1957,
became increasingly interested in understanding how biology has
managed (and how technology might manage) to construct reliable
organisms out of unreliable parts. He believed the von Neumann
architecture would soon be replaced by something else. Even if codes
could be completely debugged, million-cell memories could never be
counted upon, digitally, to behave consistently from one kilocycle
to the next.
</p><p>
Fifty years later, thanks to solid state micro-electronics, the von
Neumann matrix is going strong. The problem has shifted from how to
achieve reliable results using sloppy hardware, to how to achieve
reliable results using sloppy code. The von Neumann architecture is
here to stay. But new forms of architecture, built upon the
underlying layers of Turing-von Neumann machines, are starting to
grow. What's next? Where was von Neumann heading when his program
came to a halt?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This is all excerpted from an earlier lecture by George, by the same
title as the one he was giving at eTech. In this earlier lecture, George
was focused on AI:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I found myself recollecting the words of Alan Turing, in his seminal
paper &ldquo;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&rdquo;, a founding document in
the quest for true AI. &ldquo;In attempting to construct such machines we
should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any
more than we are in the procreation of children&rdquo;, Turing had
advised. &ldquo;Rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will
providing mansions for the souls that He creates.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then he added, &ldquo;Google is Turing's cathedral, awaiting its
soul.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I think, however, the cathedral is bigger than Google. In fact, I think
it's bigger than a cathedral. I think it's a new world, built on
materials no less natural yet man-made than the rocks and wood shaped
and assembled into nave and transept, buttress and spire.
</p><p>
I reached that conclusion watching George flash quote after quote up on
the screen in the front of the ballroom, each drawing another line in
the shape we came to call computing. I photographed as many as I could,
and transcribed a number of them. I've arranged them in chronological
order, starting 450 years ago, with several more added in from my own
quote collection. Follow the threads:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;Why may we not say that all Automata (Engines that move themselves
by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have artificiall
life?&rdquo;&mdash;Thomas Hobbes, 1651
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;By Ratiocination, I mean computation. Now to compute, is either to
collect the sum of many things that are added together, and to know
what remains when one thing is taken out of another...and if any
man adde Multiplication and Division, I will not be against it,
seeing Multiplication is nothing but Addition of equals one to
another, and Division is nothing but a Subtraction of equals one
from another, as often as is possible. So that all Ratiocination is
comprehended in these two operations of the minde Addition and
Subtraction.&rdquo;&mdash;Thomas Hobbes, 1656
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;This [binary] calculus could be implemented by a machine (without
wheels)...provided with holes in such a way that they can be opened
and closed. They are to be open at those places that correspond to a
1 and remain closed at those that correspond to a 0. Through the
opened gates small cubes or marbles are to fall into tracks, through
the others nothing. It [the gate array] is to be shifted from column
to column as required.&rdquo;&mdash;G.W. von Leibniz, March 16, 1679
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Is it a fact&mdash;or have I dreamed it&mdash;that, by means of
electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve, vibrating
thousands of miles in a breathless point of time? Rather the round
globe is a vast head, a brain, instinct with intelligence! Or shall
I say, it is itself a thought, nothing but a thought, and no longer
the substance which we deemed it?&rdquo;&mdash;Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1851
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;I see the Net as a world we might see as a bubble. A sphere. It's
growing larger and larger, and yet inside, every point in that
sphere is visible to every other one. That's the architecture of a
sphere. Nothing stands between any two points. That's its virtue:
it's empty in the middle. The distance between any two points is
functionally zero, and not just because they can see each other, but
because nothing interferes with operation between any two points.
There's a word I like for what's going on here: terraform. It's the
verb for creating a world. That's what we're making here: a new
world. Now the question is, what are we going to do to cause
planetary existence? How can we terraform this new world in a way
that works for the world and not just ourselves?&rdquo;&mdash;Craig Burton, in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, 1999
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Here are three basic rules of behavior that are tied directly to the
factual nature of the Internet: 1) No one owns it. 2) Everyone can
use it. 3) Anyone can improve it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;World of
Ends&rdquo;, by Doc Searls
and David Weinberger, 2003
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;There are a couple of reasons why we have national parks and access
to the seashore. Some things are so much the gifts of nature that
they should be reserved for everyone. And some things (like the
sea, and like the Internet) are so important to each of us that
keeping them freely available makes us a group of citizens rather
than slaves....Now&mdash;the Internet wasn't created by nature; it's
an agreement between machines made possible by the designers of that
agreement (or protocol). But it is a great gift, and it is very
important to being a citizen, and for these reasons it is owned by
all for common use. It's a commons, like the Boston Common. And no
sovereign ever showed up to which the people who 'own' the Internet
(that is, everyone) surrendered their ownership.&rdquo;&mdash;Susan Crawford,
January 2003
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;We had this idea back in the 70s that one day we would make
computers that would somehow be intelligent on their own. And it's not
quite working that way. What we're doing is making computers
intelligent because we're part of them.&rdquo;&mdash;Tim O'Reilly at eTech 2006
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As creatures, human beings are gifted with something perhaps even more
significant than the powers of intelligence and speech. We also have the
capacity to extend the boundaries of our bodies beyond our skin, hair
and nails. Through a process of indwelling, we are enlarged and
empowered by our clothes, tools and vehicles. When we grab a hammer and
drive a nail, the hammer becomes an extension of our arm. Our senses
extend through the wood of the handle and the metal of the head, as we
pound a nail through a board. Oddly, the hammer does not make us
superhuman, but more human. Because nothing could be more human than to
use a tool.
</p><p>
Likewise, when we drive a car, ride a bike or pilot a plane, our senses
extend to mechanical perimeters. We don't just think &ldquo;my
tires&rdquo;, &ldquo;my
wings&rdquo;, &ldquo;my fender&rdquo;, &ldquo;my engine&rdquo;. We know these things are ours. They
are parts of our selves, enlarged by the merging of sense and skill and
material.
</p><p>
A robin is born knowing how to build a nest. A human is born knowing how
to do little beyond suckling. Yet because we are gifted with an endless
capacity for learning, and for enlarging our selves, and for doing these
things together in groups of all sizes, we have built something larger
than ourselves called civilization.
</p><p>
Open-source infrastructural building materials and methods have enabled
us to build a new framework, a new environment, for civilization. Call
it a giant brain, a World of Ends, or a network of networks. In every
case, it is a product of the form of nature we call human.
</p><p>
The purpose of this new world&mdash;this natural environment for business,
study, games and countless other human activities&mdash;is to be useful.
In the same way that our senses extend from our bodies to our tools and
vehicles, the usefulness of kernel-space code extends into the Net
that's built on that code.
</p><p>
As a result, user space has become almost unimaginably large. And sure to
become larger.
