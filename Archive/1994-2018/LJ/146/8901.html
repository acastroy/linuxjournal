With libferris, the boundary of your filesystem extends to include PostgreSQL, XML, db4, RDF, the X Window System, Evolution and much more.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbfd580.0xcf51e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The libferris virtual filesystem always has sought to push the boundaries
of what a filesystem should do in terms of what can be mounted and what
metadata is available for files. During the past five years, it has expanded
its capabilities from mounting more traditional things, such as tar.gz,
SSH, digital cameras and IPC primitives, to being able to mount various Indexed
Sequential Access Mechanism (ISAM) files, including db4, tdb, edb, eet
and gdbm; various relational databases, including odbc, MySQL and
PostgreSQL;
various servers, such as HTTP, FTP, LDAP, Evolution and RDF graphs; as well
as XML files and Sleepycat's dbXML.
</p><p>
Recently, support for indexing filesystem data using any combination of
Lucene, ODBC, TSearch2, xapian, LDAP, PostgreSQL and Web search has been
added with the ability to query these back ends for matching files. Matches
naturally are presented as a virtual filesystem. Details of using the
index and search capabilities of libferris appeared in the February
2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> in my article
&ldquo;Filesystem Indexing with libferris&rdquo;. I should mention that anything you see
mounted as a filesystem in this article can be indexed and searched for
as described in that past article on searching.
</p><p>
You can access your libferris virtual filesystem either by native
libferris clients or by exporting libferris through Samba.
</p><p>
The two primary abstractions in libferris are the Context and the Extended
Attribute (EA). A Context can be thought of as a superclass of a file or
directory. In libferris, there is less of a distinction between a file
and a directory with the ability for a file to behave like a directory
if it is treated like one. For example, if you try to read a tar.gz file
as a directory, libferris automatically mounts the archive as
a filesystem and lists the contents of the archive as a virtual filesystem.
</p><p>
The EA interface can be thought of as a similar
concept to the Linux kernel's EA interface. That is, arbitrary key-value
data is attached to files and directories. This EA concept was extended
early on in libferris to allow the value for an attribute to be derived
from the content of a file. This means simple things like width and
height of an image or video file become first-class metadata citizens
along with a file's size and modification time. The limits on what
metadata is available extend far beyond image metadata to include XMP,
EXIF, music ID tags, Annodex media, geospatial tags, RPM metadata,
SELinux integration, partially ordered emblem categories and arbitrary
personal RDF stores of metadata.
</p><p>
Having all metadata available through a single interface allows libferris
to provide filtering and sorting capabilities on any of that metadata.
As such, you can sort a directory by any metadata just as easily as you
would use <tt  >ls -Sh</tt> to sort by file size. Sorting on multiple metadata
values is also supported in libferris; you can sort your files easily
by MIME type, then image width, then modification time&mdash;with all three
pieces of metadata contributing to the final directory ordering. Any
libferris virtual filesystem can have filtering and sorting applied to
it to obtain a new libferris virtual filesystem.
</p><p>
You can store EA values into a personal RDF store&mdash;for example, when you
write an image width to an extended attribute. When you subsequently
read the image width, you get the value you just wrote to the EA. This
extends naturally to other situations, such as when you change the x or y
EA for a window, which should move the window.
</p><p>
Allowing EA to be stored in a personal RDF file lets you add metadata
to any libferris object, even those for which you have only read access.
For example, you can attach emblems or comments to the Linux Kongress
Web site just as you would a normal file.
</p><p>
An interesting EA for all files is the content EA, which is equivalent
to the file's byte contents. Exposing the file itself through the EA
interface means that any information about a file can be obtained via
the same interface.
</p><p>
libferris is written in C++ and provides a standard IOStream interface to
both Contexts and EA. Many standard file utilities have been rewritten
to take advantage of libferris features. These clients include ls, cp,
mv, rm, mkdir, cat, find, touch, IO redirection and more.

Filesystem Interaction</h2></div></div><p>
As we explore these filesystems, I use the ferrisls command, which mimics
the coreutils ls(1) command. As well as the -l long listing option,
I use the -0 (zero) recommended-ea option of ferrisls. This
operates in much the same way as -l, though it asks the filesystem
itself which EAs are most interesting for the user to see. I assume a
shell alias of fls=ferrisls in the code examples.
</p><p>
I start by showing interaction with the standard kernel-based
filesystems and some of the EA possibilities. Along with the
recommended-ea option, ferrisls supports the --xml option to produce an
XML document as output. This provides information as to what EA each
value belongs and provides one possibility to drive Web interfaces
using libferris.

&lt;/ferrisls&gt;

</pre></div><p>
As mentioned previously, if you are sorting a directory on an EA that does not
provide a complete ordering, you can chain together sorting predicates. For
example, in Listing 3, I have sorted the output based on
the numeric EA height and then used a version string sort on the name EA.
A version sort is similar to the ls(1) -v option, which in Listing 3 has placed foo20.png after foo3.png. Such sorting is
very useful when sorting by file type or MIME major type followed by name.

The two concepts of files forming a tree and files having key-value pairs
attached to them are similar to the structure of XML. With libferris,
you can poke inside XML documents as though they were just another
filesystem. For example, see Listing 4.

By interacting with your filesystem, you can cause updates on the
underlying XML document as well. The ferris-redirect client exists to
allow shell-like redirection into libferris files. The -T or --trunc
option truncates an existing file before writing stdin into it. This
is much like the &gt;| shell option. As you can see from the interaction
in Listing 5, we have changed the structure of the
example.xml document significantly through filesystem interaction.

As many modern word-processing documents are XML inside a compressed
container, libferris allows you to drill down into the office document
as though it were a filesystem. In Listing 6, I am
listing a simple OpenOffice.org Writer document as a filesystem.

A Xerces-C Document Object Model (DOM) can be obtained for any libferris
filesystem, just as a Xerces-C DOM can be mounted as a libferris
filesystem. Creation of a DOM for a filesystem is evaluated lazily,
so you can get a DOM for file:// and only the parts of the DOM that are
required are ever created.
</p><p>
The ability to convert any libferris filesystem into a DOM allows you to
apply XSLT to your filesystems easily. The example C++ code in Listing
7 applies a stylesheet to a mounted OpenOffice.org document.

Recently, support for mounting applications such as Firefox, Evolution
and the X Window System was added to libferris.
</p><p>
The evolution:// filesystem allows you to mount your Evolution
mail client. Support currently extends to your mail folders and
contacts. Using this filesystem, it is no longer necessary to save
attachments to temporary files to access them from ferris-aware systems.
</p><p>
Mounting your X Window System is done via the xwin:// filesystem. This gives
access to your window objects as well as lets you mount Klipper
on KDE desktops. For Klipper, you can <tt  >ls</tt>,
<tt  >cat</tt> and <tt  >cp</tt> your past
clipboard interactions easily, and overwriting the top clipboard element
is effectively a clipboard copy. The window mounting lets you
see where your windows are in terms of x,y offsets as well as other
interesting data.
Listing 8 shows a sample session of mounting
my Evolution mail client and the X Window System.

Mounting databases allows you to explore the database server,
its databases and their tables and views. Shown in Listing 9, I create a database, populate it and interact with it
as a virtual filesystem. The final command using the --xml option for
ferrisls exports each tuple in XML format.
</p><p>
Instead of embedding the user name and password in the URL, libferris
elects to store this information in configuration files. This is a
trade-off where the risk of accidentally copying and pasting a URL with embedded
user credentials is minimized at the expense of having a central store of
available credentials and mappings for where to use each credential. For
many common URLs, inline authentication information is also supported.

A libferris filesystem can nominate which objects it is happy to have
created on it. You can see this list by using the fcreate or gfcreate
tools in the ferriscreate package. A large list of possibilities will be
displayed for an <tt  >fcreate -l /tmp</tt>, for example. For
a PostgreSQL database, you
can create only a small number of new object types, as shown in Listing 10. I'll use fcreate in a moment to create a new empty db4
file to show how filesystem monitoring is virtualized in libferris.

Many changes made to a libferris filesystem are reflected instantly in
other libferris applications. Many kernel-level interfaces
let applications know when a kernel filesystem changes&mdash;for example,
inotify and dnotify. libferris extends this to allow clients to know
when a virtual filesystem has changed. For example, when you update an
element inside of an XML file, inotify tells you only that the XML
file has changed. With libferris, you can see exactly which part of the
XML file was modified by other libferris applications.
</p><p>
Listing 11 demonstrates the filesystem
monitoring support. In the example, I use the --monitor-all option of
ferrisls. This makes ferrisls operate like a tail -f for your given URL;
any creation, deletion or interesting filesystem activity is shown on
the console. In another terminal, Listing 12, I'm creating,
deleting and writing to &ldquo;files&rdquo; inside a Berkeley db4 file. ferrisls
happily reports what is happening to these virtual files.

Many operations performed with libferris are also stored for possible
future use. This includes the types of files you recently created
(png, jpeg, db, tuple and so on), which files you recently edited and viewed
and more. All of this is kept only for your personal use and never
sent anywhere. Storage of metadata on files you view and edit is
called remembrance in libferris. Only view and edit actions invoked
through libferris are currently remembered. Listing 13 shows how I set up Xine to be executed as the default view
operation on Annodex media files.

Now we can explore what libferris knows about our past operations. By
default, remembered operations are grouped by operation type then media
type. The recommended EA for the final directories in the tree are the
filename and the time it was last viewed or edited. This history virtual
filesystem shown in Listing 14 shows only a set
amount of the most recent operations so as not to become too large.

For each file, you also can bring up the complete list of view and edit
times. This uses what libferris calls a branch filesystem. A branch
filesystem best can be described as an entire personal filesystem attached
to a file. Branch filesystems are accessed using the branches:// handler;
all other URL handlers appear as direct children of branches://.
</p><p>
In Listing 15, I take a look at what branches are available for my media
file and explore the remembrance view filesystem. Then, out of curiosity,
I take a look into the extents branch and see that the kernel's XFS
filesystem has placed the whole media file in a single contiguous extent
on disk.
</p><p>
To see if a file has a valid digital signature, you simply can read the
has-valid-signature EA on the file. The signatures branch filesystem
allows much more detail to be exposed about the signature. The
branchfs-attributes filesystem exposes all EAs for a file as a
filesystem. Sometimes it is more convenient to access an EA as though
it is a file.
