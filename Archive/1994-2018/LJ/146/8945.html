<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #146, June 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

With the imminent advent of version 3 of the <span   class="bold"><b>GNU
General Public License</b></span>, the
question naturally comes up whether Linux will continue to be licensed under
version 2, or migrate to version 3. The answer seems to be that no migration
will occur. Even if Linus Torvalds wanted to, he does not control the
copyright of all the thousands upon thousands of code contributions that
have gone into the kernel over the years, and only those copyright holders
could authorize a license change for their own contributions. Although
attempts to track down all the contributors and obtain permission have been
made by optimistic souls, it is virtually impossible to do this. The GPL
version 2 will be the Linux kernel license for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, more and more kernel variables and functions are being set to
operate only with GPLed third-party drivers. The kernel can do this by
testing any driver to see if it sets a variable indicating the license
under which its
code is released. If the license is the GPL, the kernel allows access
to those restricted symbols. Otherwise, it's denied. This recently bit
<span   class="bold"><b>AVM</b></span>, when
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> restricted the
<span   class="bold"><b>USB subsystem</b></span> to operate only with GPLed
drivers. AVM always had released its own binary-only driver for its
hardware, but this new change stopped it in its tracks. The change itself
was reverted out of the kernel, although it did turn out that one reason
Greg had implemented that change was because it has been possible for some time
now to write USB drivers in user space with no loss of speed. Regardless,
one result of this particular confrontation was for Greg to implement some
logging infrastructure, so that symbols soon to be GPL-restricted would be
clearly identified in the logs at runtime, and sysadmins on those systems
could begin to make reasonable preparations for that change.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span> has begun gathering
together useful <span   class="bold"><b>2.4 patches</b></span> and making
them available at a central location. In general, there has been an outcry
among some users that without the even/odd development dichotomy, and with
2.4 virtually stationary, there is now no stable series that is still
reasonably up to date with current features. Arguments by the kernel
developers that distributions take care of kernel stability, and that the
w.x.y.z tree was created specifically to address the issue of stability, are
unconvincing for one key reason. Although it's true that those kernels may get
good uptime, their behaviors are still potentially inconsistent from version
to version&mdash;that is, the code base itself is unstable, making it difficult for
user-space developers to create systems that behave reliably for the
services they require. Although it seems clear to me that eventually kernel
development will have to give stability first-class consideration,
so far there is no real movement in that direction among the top developers. This may
be one reason why Willy's foray back toward 2.4 maintenance has come about.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>IDE driver</b></span> may be going away at some point in the medium future, as
<span   class="bold"><b>libata</b></span> becomes more and more robust, and
a more viable replacement for
it. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> is confident that, although now is still not the time for a
straightforward replacement, it is still the goal and the intention of
ongoing libata development. It's important to bear in mind, when considering
this, that the <span   class="bold"><b>IDE</b></span> nightmare cannot be ended simply by replacing one set of
code with another. The IDE standards are still (and will continue to be) a
horrible mess, and vendor interpretation and compliance with those standards
is still (and will continue to be) extremely nuanced and difficult to
support. So whatever the future of IDE may be, it will have to
accommodate all the twists, turns, bumps and punctures endured in the past.
Even if all future IDE hardware magically conformed to a single sane
standard, it would be quite some time before we could abandon support for
all the older hardware.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Reiser 4</b></span> filesystem has not unexpectedly run into problems being
accepted into the Linux kernel. After the most recent flame war, which had
some developers throwing up their hands and saying they refused to give
feedback on ReiserFS patches until <span   class="bold"><b>Hans
Reiser</b></span> stopped attacking them,
responses to ReiserFS posts on the mailing list have thinned out. Without
the support of the kernel developers, the possibility of Reiser 4 going into
the kernel becomes more problematic. Only the kernel developers fully grasp
the requirements that any given patch must meet in order to be accepted into
the tree. Without their guidance, Reiser 4 may have a hard time moving in
the right direction. And as Reiser 4 development continues to diverge from
the kernel proper, the patch that must ultimately be accepted into the
kernel grows as well, adding much to the work required for final
integration. Almost certainly Reiser 4 will make it into the kernel
eventually, but probably not before its developers solve the technical and
social issues that confront them.

<h2 class="title">Saving Dollars with CentOS</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #146, June 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

At the Austin BarCamp in March 2006, I found myself sitting next to a guy
with a large new laptop that seemed to be running some kind of Linux.
Turned out his name was Matt Lawrence, his laptop was a new Dell
Inspiron 9300, his job was systems administration and his Linux of
choice was CentOS.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8945centosf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Matt Lawrence with his Dell Running CentOS
</p></div></div><p>
I asked him about it. Here are my notes, all quotes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
CentOS's goal is to be as close to Red Hat as possible without
violating trademarks and copyrights. They lag behind Red Hat
Enterprise 4 by two or three weeks. All the security and other
updates are constantly coming out.
</p><p>
If you want support from a person, buy Red Hat Enterprise Linux. If
you want support from a community with the same code base, get CentOS.
</p><p>
They fit nicely together. You can run Red Hat Enterprise for
production and run CentOS for development and testing.
</p><p>
It's my preferred desktop. And I'd say it's an excellent desktop
system choice for small companies. Getting it up and running on this
new Dell was easy. It came right up, ready to go. The only glitch
was X. I had to edit the X config file for screen, which is 1920 x
1200. That's 16 x 9 rather than 4 x 3.
</p><p>
So I got the minimum up off one CD, then added the packages I wanted.
It took about an hour to pull those down over DSL using yum.
</p><p>
It's a good deal. I get paid for doing Red Hat. And I save my own
money running CentOS.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
We'd appreciate hearing about your experiences with CentOS as well.
