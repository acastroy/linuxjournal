Who needs NFS or Samba when you can mount filesystems with SSHFS?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aaa580.0x1ba22f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Tools like scp, sftp and rsync allow us to copy
files easily and securely between these accounts. But, what if we don't want to copy the
files to our local system before using them? Normally, this would be
a good place for a traditional network filesystem, such as NFS, OpenAFS
or Samba. Unfortunately, setting up these network filesystems requires
administrator access on both systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aaa580.0x1ba23f8"></a>
Enter SSHFS and FUSE</h2></div></div><p>
Luckily, as long as you have SSH access, you can use SSHFS to mount and use
remote directory trees as if they were local. SSHFS requires no special
software on the remote side, just a modern SSH server with support for
the SFTP extension. All modern Linux distributions support this
extension,
which was added to OpenSSH in version 2.3.0, released in November 2000.
</p><p>
SSHFS is built upon the FUSE user-space filesystem framework project. FUSE
allows user-space software, SSH in this case, to present a virtual
filesystem interface to the user. This is similar to how the /proc
and /sys filesystems present kernel internals in the form of files in a
directory tree. SSHFS connects to the remote system and does all the
necessary operations to provide the look and feel of a regular filesystem
interface for remote files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aaa580.0x1ba2558"></a>
Installing SSHFS and FUSE</h2></div></div><p>
I am using Fedora Core 4 on the workstation where I will be mounting the
remote directories. The remote system is also Fedora Core 4, but any *NIX
system running a modern SSH server with the SFTP extension will work. Your
Linux kernel also must have the user-space filesystems feature enabled,
either built-in or as a module.
</p><p>
All the software required for SSHFS is available as packages installable
with yum for Fedora Core 4. Simply run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ yum install fuse-sshfs
</pre>
</p><p>
This installs SSHFS, FUSE and the fuse-lib dependencies
automatically. You also can build SSHFS from source, but more on that
later.
</p><p>
Before you can use SSHFS or any other FUSE-based filesystem as a nonroot
user, you must first add those users to the fuse group. In my case,
my user name is matt. This can be done from the command line as root
with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ usermod  -a -G fuse matt
</pre>
</p><p>
The fuse group lets you limit which users are allowed to use FUSE-based filesystems. This is important because FUSE installs setuid
programs, which always carry security implications. On a highly secured
system, access to such programs should be evaluated and controlled.
</p><p>
After installing and configuring the software, we are ready to give it a
whirl. To demonstrate the basic functionality, I will make a connection
to a remote system called my.randombox.com. The default operation for
SSHFS is to mount the remote user's home directory; this is the most common
use of SSHFS. Just like mounting any other filesystem, you need an empty
directory called a mountpoint under which the remote filesystem will be
mounted. I create a mountpoint named randombox_home, and then invoke
the sshfs command to mount the remote filesystem. Here is how it's done:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir randombox_home
$ sshfs  matt@my.randombox.com:  randombox_home
matt@my.randombox.com's password: ************
$ ls -l randombox_home/
-rw-r-----  1 matt users     7286 Feb 11 08:59 sshfs.article.main.txt
drwx------  1 matt users     2048 Mar 21  2001 projects
drwx------  1 matt users     2048 Dec  1  2000 Mail
drwxr-xr-x  1 matt users     4096 Jun  8  2002 public_html
$ cp ~/my_web_site/index.html randombox_home/public_html/
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. My home directory on my.randombox.com is now mounted under
the directory randombox_home on my local workstation. In the background,
FUSE, SSHFS and the remote SSH server is doing all the legwork to make my
remote home directory appear just like any other local filesystem. If you
want to mount a directory other than your home directory, simply put
it after the colon on the sshfs command line. You even can specify /
to mount an entire remote system. You will of course have access only to
the files and directories for which the remote user account has permission.
Everything else will get &ldquo;Permission denied&rdquo; messages. An example of
this is shown below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir randombox_slash
$ sshfs  matt@my.randombox.com:/  randombox_slash
matt@my.randombox.com's password:
$ ls -l randombox_slash/

Automating the Connection</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see from the above examples, I needed to type my password
to complete the SSH connection to the remote system. This can be
eliminated by creating a trust relationship between the local and remote
user accounts. This is not appropriate in all situations, because it
essentially makes the accounts equivalent from a security perspective. Any
malicious activity on one account can spread to other systems via the
trust, so take caution and fully understand the implications of setting
up trust relationships. To begin setting this up, you need to create
an SSH key pair, which consists of public and private key files named
id_rsa and id_rsa.pub, respectively.
</p><p>
The public key is copied to the remote system and placed in the
$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file. Some systems may use the filename
authorized_keys2 in addition to or instead of authorized_keys.
</p><p>
This allows any user in possession of the private key to authenticate
without a password. We create the key pair using the command
<tt  >ssh-keygen</tt>.
The files are placed in the proper locations automatically on the
local system in the $HOME/.ssh directory. Because we already have my remote
home directory mounted, appending the public key to the authorized_keys
file is extra easy. Below are all the steps required (assuming you
created the equivalent of the randombox_home directory and mounted it):

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cd $HOME
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/matt/.ssh/id_rsa): &lt;ENTER&gt;
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):  &lt;ENTER&gt;
Enter same passphrase again:  &lt;ENTER&gt;
Your identification has been saved in /home/matt/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/matt/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
fa:e7:7c:e1:cb:7b:66:8b:67:07:05:99:7f:05:b9:4a matt@myworkstation
$ mkdir randombox_home/.ssh
$ chmod 700 randombox_home/.ssh
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; randombox_home/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 600 randombox_home/.ssh/authorized_keys

</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, we create the key pair with an empty passphrase,
then append the public key to the authorized_keys file in the remote
home directory and set the permissions. After this is done, I
no longer need to type the password when connecting to the remote
account. To test this, first we unmount the remote home directory with
the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ fusermount -u randombox_home
</pre>
</p><p>
To test the trust relationship, we can try to run the uptime command on
the remote system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh matt@my.randombox.com uptime
12:20:40  up 38 days,  4:12,  0 users,  load average: 0.11, 0.04, 0.01
</pre>
</p><p>
Good, no password needed. The trust relationship is working properly. If
you have trouble getting this trust relationship to work, check the
permissions on the files in .ssh on both systems. Many times lax
permissions prevent SSH from using key files. Also, take a look at the
syslog log files. OpenSSH's sshd server logs messages into syslog,
which often are helpful in diagnosing key file problems. You may have
to increase the logging verbosity level in the sshd_config file, usually
found in /etc/ssh/.
</p><p>
You also can debug the connection by running ssh in the above example
with the -vvv option to turn up verbosity. Now, let's mount the
remote directory again. This time it does not prompt for my password:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir randombox_home
$ sshfs  matt@my.randombox.com:  randombox_home
$ ls -l randombox_home/
-rw-r-----  1 matt users     7286 Feb 11 10:33 sshfs.article.main.txt
drwx------  1 matt users     2048 Mar 21  2001 projects
drwx------  1 matt users     2048 Dec  1  2000 Mail
drwxr-xr-x  1 matt users     4096 Jun  8  2002 public_html
</pre>

Integrating with the GNOME Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
In the last example, we configured and automated non-interactive mounting
of a remote directory. Because we're no longer being prompted for a
password, we can integrate SSHFS mounting into scripts, or better yet the
GNOME desktop. To configure GNOME to mount our remote
home directory automatically, we configure the SSHFS mount command as a session
startup program. This is done from inside the Sessions preferences
dialog. Navigate to Desktop&rarr;Preferences&rarr;More
Preferences&rarr;Sessions-&gt;Add,
and fill in the dialog as shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8904f1.large.jpg"><img src="8904f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Set up a GNOME startup command to mount an SSHFS share.
</p></div></div><p>
Upon the next login, GNOME automatically mounts the remote directory
for me, as you can see in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8904f2.large.jpg"><img src="8904f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. GNOME automatically mounts the remote directory.
</p></div></div><p>
Note that GNOME does not reliably kill this command upon exiting
the session. You can unmount the remote directory manually using the
<tt  >fusermount -u randombox_home</tt> command. Another
option is
to automate the unmount by modifying the $HOME/.Xclients-default file to
run the fusermount command as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash
# (c) 2001 Red Hat, Inc.

WM="gnome-session"
WMPATH="/usr/bin /usr/X11R6/bin /usr/local/bin"

# Kludged to run fusermount upon gnome logout.  20060301-MEH
for p in $WMPATH ; do
     [ -x $p/$WM ] &amp;&amp; $p/$WM; fusermount  -u randombox_home; exit 0
done

exit 1

</pre>
</p><p>
Be aware that the .Xclients-default file is rewritten every time you
run the switchdesk utility. You have to modify this file every
time you use use the switchdesk utility to change your default desktop
windowing manager.
</p><p>
Finally, you can add the appropriate sshfs commands in the boot startup
file that is appropriate for your distribution. This way, your system
will mount all the SSHFS directories automatically each time you boot
your desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aaa580.0x1ba3580"></a>
Building SSHFS from Source</h2></div></div><p>
If your particular Linux distribution does not prepackage SSHFS, or if
you simply want to build it from source, this also is pretty easy. First,
confirm that you have installed whatever files or packages are required
for kernel module development. You need these to build the FUSE
kernel module. Then, download the latest source tarballs for both
FUSE and SSHFS from SourceForge (see the on-line Resources). Place the
downloaded tarball files in a temporary directory, then build and install
using the following commands in that directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -xzf fuse-2.5.2.tar.gz
$ cd fuse-2.5.2
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ su  -c "make install"
$ cd ..
$ tar -xzf sshfs-fuse-1.5.tar.gz
$ cd sshfs-fuse-1.5
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ su  -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
After everything is installed, you are ready to perform any of the
examples presented previously. After installation, the sshfs and
fusermount commands are installed in /usr/bin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aaa580.0x1ba3738"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
SSHFS and FUSE allow any remote storage to be mounted and used just
like any other filesystem. If you can log in with SSH, you have all the
access you need.
</p><p>
As I said earlier, FUSE is a framework for creating user-space
filesystems. SSHFS is only the tip of the iceberg. There are FUSE-based
filesystems to encrypt your files (EncFS) transparently, browse Bluetooth
devices (BTFS) or mount a CVS repository as a filesystem (CvsFS).
Perhaps you were wondering what to do with all that free space in your
Gmail account? Well, GmailFS allows you to mount your Gmail account
and use it like a local filesystem. See the FUSE Web site for these
and more great projects, or perhaps you would like to write your own.
FUSE has language bindings for Perl, Python, TCL, C, C#, Ruby and others.
