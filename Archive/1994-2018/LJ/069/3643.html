describing situations where a popular candidate, usually a
presidential one, can carry other members of his party into office
on the basis of his popularity&mdash;on his &ldquo;coattails&rdquo;. Such an
analogy fits this year well. Instead of a year of elections, we
have a year of Linux and Open Source, each carrying a wide array of
programming languages and applications into the mainstream through
association.</p><p>One language of note riding the Penguin's wake is a web
scripting language called PHP that has gathered users at an
impressive rate. PHP competes against a sea of languages used to
generate &ldquo;dynamic web pages&rdquo;--pages that consist partly or wholly
of code and are interpreted every time they are viewed. Rival
languages include Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP), Allaire's
Cold Fusion and even Perl. More established competition would be
hard to find.</p><p>PHP's popularity is further evidenced by sales of the book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Core PHP Programming</em></span> by Leon Atkinson, one of
the few available books on the language. The book, having already
sold out of its first printing, has placed consistently in the
bestsellers at the on-line computer book retailers. And, according
to Atkinson's web page, a second edition is being
considered.</p><p>With only one PHP book available, such popularity might be
attributed to the subject rather than the quality of the book. In
this case, PHP might as well be BASIC, for Atkinson's writing
stands among the best in the expanse of computer books, bucking the
trend of quantity over quality that plagues so many
thousand-plus-page books. Atkinson's writing is uncommonly concise
and comprehensive.</p><p>Atkinson begins sensibly with an introduction to the
language, detailing its advantages over the competition. With
something as intentionally transparent as a web scripting language,
such discussion is vital. Surfers have little chance of knowing
which sites employ any web scripting language. For instance, the
popular software site for Linux, freshmeat.net, uses PHP
exclusively, although users cannot detect it viewing the opening
page. Atkinson advocacy is traditional for open-source software,
arguing that it beats the competition in price and
flexibility&mdash;notably, it can be modified freely and
distributed.</p><p>PHP's introduction and language basics comprise the first of
four sections in the book. The introduction is quite rudimentary,
suitable for complete beginners to programming. Variable
declaration and other important but introductory topics are
discussed exclusively in the opening section. For many&mdash;if not
most&mdash;readers familiar with Perl, a language that bears substantial
similarity to PHP, drifting through basic concepts like type
casting and <b  >for</b> statements to find the key
differences between languages may be frustrating. A section or two
comparing PHP and Perl would have been nice. It is, however, not
too problematic, as most readers will soon become familiar through
examples or reference sections if they do not slog through the
opening chapters.</p><p>Atkinson calls the second section a &ldquo;functional reference&rdquo;,
combining a traditional function reference with detailed examples
on each function. Despite the redundancy of nearly identical
functions and examples for SQL database calls in MySQL, mSQL and
PostgreSQL, the design serves another purpose. By giving an example
with each function, Atkinson allows the reader to learn by example.
Such instruction should suit the type of programmer who is familiar
but not proficient with the language, assuring him with each
example that he is using both the function and related functions
correctly. And while the reference does take up the majority of the
book, Atkinson keeps examples brief but useful.</p><p>For beginning users, the third section, entitled
&ldquo;Algorithms&rdquo;, provides an interesting path for readers, building
from stable searching and sorting methods like bubble and quick
sort, to more functional examples like retrieval from SQL
databases. Such a design may strike more advanced users as somewhat
silly, since no need for a bubble sort exists when using SQL or
most other databases commonly accessed by PHP. Indeed, actually
using PHP to sort a large database would be inadvisable&mdash;such a
scheme would essentially entail compiling and executing code to
sort the database every time a browser viewed the page. While parts
of the chapter do seem better suited for an introductory computer
course, struggling users may find familiar computer-science
algorithms implemented in PHP helpful.</p><p>In the final section, Atkinson shines, taking the crucial
step away from teaching the language to applying it in real-world
examples and advising how to make the language a true alternative
to the heavyweights of ASP and Cold Fusion. He calls the section
&ldquo;Software Engineering&rdquo;, in reference to the increasingly popular
term &ldquo;Web Engineer&rdquo;--comparing the construction a programmer does
to that of a civil engineer. Discussing issues of design,
efficiency and debugging, Atkinson outlines the important aspect of
using PHP, doing useful things with it, namely building web
sites.</p><p>Considering PHP's rivals, discussion of web engineering with
PHP serves one purpose beyond instruction: it adds to the
credibility of the language as a serious rival to its high-priced
and high-powered competitors. Through discussing how to efficiently
design an expansive and maintainable site&mdash;something quite uncommon
in an introductory text&mdash;Atkinson gets to the heart of one possible
misconception of PHP, that it bears more resemblance in ability and
function to something like JavaScript than a more &ldquo;powerful&rdquo; and
&ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; package like ASP. The criticism has as little truth
here as when levied at Linux and open-source applications, and in
his discussions of databases and of efficiency in coding, Atkinson
develops ways of unifying a site under PHP, employing it as a tool
to build an underlying framework rather than as a method of
enhancing a pre-existing one.</p><p>For his part, Atkinson has done a wonderful job. His
precision and organization makes reading and learning PHP simple.
What should concern those interested in PHP is not how to learn
it&mdash;Atkinson has solved that problem&mdash;but where PHP, the language
itself, is headed. As with many open-source applications, PHP is
evolving quickly. One rather drastic change currently taking place
is a rewrite of the underlying &ldquo;engine&rdquo; of PHP. The project to do
so is called &ldquo;Zend&rdquo; and also involves a licensing change. While
the promise of backward compatibility exists, the prospect of new
and better functions or methods of coding looms. For some, this may
be a reason to use caution; for others, another reason to start
learning the language.</p><p>PHP's future is bright. Atkinson's book is an excellent
companion for anyone interested in learning a promising
language&mdash;fast growing coattails of its own.</p></div></div>
