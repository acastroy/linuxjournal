    Searching your web site has never been easier&mdash;an
    introduction to search methods.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x136e608"></a></h2></div></div><p>The CGI (&ldquo;common gateway interface&rdquo;)
standard was originally designed to allow users to run programs via
the Web, which would otherwise be available only on the server.
Thus, the first CGI programs were simple interfaces to
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span>, which received their
inputs from an HTML form and sent the HTML-formatted output to the
user's browser.
</p><p>CGI programs, and server-side programs in general, have
become more sophisticated since then. However, one application is
as useful now as it was in the past: the ability to search through
a web site for documents containing a particular word or
string.</p><p>While search sites (now called &ldquo;portals&rdquo;) make it possible
to browse through a large collection of pages spread out over a
number of servers, the CGI programs handling the search have an
easier job. They have to go through files only on the local server,
producing a list of URLs matching the user's request.</p><p>This month, we will look at how to implement several
different types of search programs. While these programs might not
compete successfully with ht://Dig and Webglimpse, they do offer
some insight into how these sorts of programs work, and the
trade-offs programmers must make when writing such software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x136e8c8"></a>Simple Command-Line Search</h2></div></div><p>Perl has long been my favorite language for writing
server-side programs. This is in no small part due to its strong
text-handling capabilities. Perl comes with a rich
regular-expression language that makes it easy to find one piece of
text inside another.</p><p>For example, the following one-line program prints any line
of test.txt containing the word &ldquo;foo&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -ne 'print if m/foo/' test.txt
</pre><p>The <b  >-n</b> switch tells Perl not to print
lines by default, and the <b  >-e</b> switch allows us to
insert a program between the single quotes (<b  >'</b>).
We instruct Perl to print any line in which the
<b  >m//</b> (match) operator finds the search string. We
can accomplish the same thing inside of a program, as shown in
Listing 1.
</p><p><a href="3753l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Of course, the above program searches for a single pattern
(the string &ldquo;foo&rdquo;) inside of a single file (test.txt). We can
generalize the program more by using an empty
<b  >&lt;&gt;</b>, rather than iterating over
<b  >&lt;FILE&gt;</b>. An empty
<b  >&lt;&gt;</b> iterates through each element of
<b  >@ARGV</b> (the array containing command-line
arguments), assigning each one in turn to the scalar
<b  >$ARGV</b>. If there are no command-line arguments,
then <b  >&lt;&gt;</b> expects to receive input from the
user. Listing 2 is a revised version of the above program, which
searches through multiple files for the string &ldquo;foo&rdquo;. Notice how
this version of the program prints the file name as well as the
matching line. Since <b  >$_</b> already contains a
newline character, we need not put one at the end of the
<b  >print</b> statement. Listing 2 could be rewritten in
a single line of Perl with the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -ne 'print "$ARGV: $_" if m/foo/;' *
</pre><p><a href="3753l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>
</p><p>Finally, we can make our simple search a bit more
sophisticated by allowing the user to name the pattern, as well as
the files. Listing 3 takes the first command-line argument,
removing it from <b  >@ARGV</b> and putting it in
<b  >$pattern</b>. To tell Perl that
<b  >$pattern</b> will not change, and that it should
compile the search pattern only a single time, we use
<b  >m//</b> with the <b  >/o</b>
option.</p><p><a href="3753l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Thus, to search for the pattern f.[aeiou] in all of the files
with a &ldquo;txt&rdquo; extension, we would use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./simple-search-3.pl "f.[aeiou]" *.txt
</pre><p>Sure enough, every line containing an <b  >f</b>,
followed by any character, followed by a vowel is printed on the
screen, preceded by a file name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x136f528"></a>File::Find</h2></div></div><p>The above would be a good skeleton for our web-based search
if all documents on a web site were stored in a single directory.
However, the opposite is normally the case: most web sites put
files in a number of different directories. A good search program
must traverse the entire web hierarchy, searching through each file
in each directory.</p><p>While we could certainly accomplish this ourselves, someone
has already done it for us.
<span   class="bold"><b>File::Find</b></span>, a package which comes
with Perl, makes it possible to create a
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>-like program using Perl.
File::Find exports the find subroutine, which takes a list of
arguments. The first argument is a subroutine reference invoked
once for each file encountered. The remaining arguments should be
directory and file names, which File::Find will read in sequence
until it gets to the end.</p><p>For example, Listing 4 is a short program that uses
File::Find to print all of the file names in a particular
directory. As you can see, File::Find exports the variable
<b  >$File::Find::name</b> which contains the current
file name as well as the find subroutine. The current directory is
stored in <b  >$File::Find::dir</b>.</p><p><a href="3753l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p><a href="3753l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>Listing 5 contains a version of simple-find-2.pl, which uses
File::Find to search through all of the files under a given
directory tree. As with many programs that use File::Find, the bulk
of simple-find-2.pl is spent inside of
<span   class="bold"><b>find_matches</b></span>, a subroutine called
once for every file encountered under the directories passed in
<b  >@ARGV</b>. To find all files containing the pattern
&ldquo;f.[aeiou]&rdquo; in directories under /home and /development,
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./simple-find-2.pl "f.[aeiou]" /home /development
</pre><p>Line 11 of simple-find-2.pl is particularly important, in
that it undefines <b  >$/</b>, the variable that
determines the end-of-line character. Normally, Perl's
<b  >&lt;&gt;</b> operator iterates through a file line
by line, returning <b  >undef</b> when the end is
reached. However, we want to search across an entire file, since a
pattern might have to extend across lines. By undefining
<b  >$/</b>, the line
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $contents = (&lt;FILE&gt;);
</pre>


puts the entire contents of the file handle <b  >FILE</b>
inside of <b  >$contents</b>, rather than just one line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x1366650"></a>Searching via the Web</h2></div></div><p>Now that we can search for a pattern through all files under
a particular directory, let's connect this functionality to the
Web, searching through all of the files under the HTTP server's
document hierarchy. Such a program will need to receive only a
pattern from the user, since the web hierarchy does not change very
often.</p><p><a href="3753l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>Listing 6 is an HTML form that could be used to provide such
input. This HTML form will submit its contents to
simple-cgi-find.pl, the CGI program in Listing 7. Its parameter,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pattern</em></span>, contains a Perl pattern to be
compared with the contents of each file in the web hierarchy,
simple-cgi-find.pl will return a list of documents matching the
user's pattern.</p><p><a href="3753l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p>Unfortunately, the version of File::Find that comes with Perl
does not work with the <b  >-T</b> flag, which turns on
Perl's secure <span   class="emphasis"><em>tainting</em></span> mode. CGI programs
should always be run with <b  >-T</b>, which ensures data
from outside sources is not used in potentially compromising ways.
In this case, however, we cannot run our program with
<b  >-T</b>. File::Find relies on the
<span   class="bold"><b>fastcwd</b></span> routine in the
<span   class="bold"><b>Cwd</b></span> module, which cannot be run
successfully with <b  >-T</b>. For the time being, I
suggest using these programs without <b  >-T</b>, but
when the next version of Perl is released, I strongly recommend
upgrading in order to run CGI programs with full tainting
enabled.</p><p>Our search subroutine, find_matches, has been modified
slightly, so that its results will be more relevant for web users.
The first thing it does is to make sure the file has an extension
indicating it contains HTML-formatted text or plain text. This
ensures that the search will not try to view graphics files, which
can contain any characters:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
return unless (m/\.html?$/i or m/\.te?xt$/i);
</pre><p>Some web sites mark HTML files with extensions of .htm (or
.HTM), and their text files with .txt or .TXT rather than .text.
The above pattern allows for all of these variations, ignoring case
with the <b  >/i</b> switch and ensuring the suffix comes
at the end of the pattern with the <b  >$</b>
metacharacter.
</p><p>After retrieving the contents of the current file,
find_matches checks to see if <b  >$pattern</b> can be
found inside of <b  >$contents</b>, which contains the
document's contents. We surround <b  >$pattern</b> with
\b characters, to look for <b  >$pattern</b> on word
boundaries. This ensures that searching for &ldquo;foo&rdquo; will not match
the word &ldquo;food&rdquo;, even though the former is a subset of the
latter.</p><p>If a match is found, find_matches creates a URL by
substituting <b  >$search_root</b> with
<b  >$url_root</b>, which hides the HTML document
hierarchy from outside users. It then prints the file name inside a
hyperlink to that URL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ($contents =~ m|\b$pattern\b|ios)
{
my $url = "$File::Find::dir/$filename";
$url =~ s/$search_root/$url_origin/;
print qq{&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="$url"&gt;$filename&lt;/a&gt;\n}
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x1367150"></a>Improving on our Web Search</h2></div></div><p>While simple-cgi-find.pl works, it does have a few problems.
For starters, it fails to differentiate between HTML tags and
actual content. Searching for &ldquo;IMG&rdquo; should not match any document
containing an &lt;IMG&gt; tag, but rather any content outside of
HTML tags that contains that string. For this reason, we will
modify our program to remove HTML tags from the input file.</p><p>Beginning Perl programmers often think that the best way to
remove HTML tags is to remove anything between &lt; and &gt;, as
in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$contents =~ s|&lt;.+&gt;||g;
</pre><p>Since &ldquo;.&rdquo; tells Perl to match any character and &ldquo;+&rdquo; tells
Perl to match one or more of the preceding character, the statement
above looks like it tells Perl to remove all of the HTML tags.
Unfortunately, this is not the case&mdash;the statement will remove
everything between the first &lt; and the final &gt; appearing in
the file. This is because Perl's patterns are &ldquo;greedy&rdquo;, and try
to maximize the number of characters they match.
</p><p>We can make &ldquo;+&rdquo; non-greedy and try to match only the
minimum number of characters by placing a ? after it. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$contents =~ s|&lt;.+?&gt;||g;
</pre><p>There is also the sticky issue of what to do if
<b  >$pattern</b> contains white space. Should it be
considered as a search phrase containing one or more white-space
characters? Or should it be considered several different words with
an &ldquo;or&rdquo; or &ldquo;and&rdquo; search?
</p><p><a href="3753l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p><p>In this particular case, we can have our cake and eat it,
too. By adding a set of radio buttons to the HTML form, we can
allow the user to choose whether a search should be literal,
require all search terms be found or require any one of the search
terms be found.</p><p>Now we can modify our program to handle &ldquo;phrase&rdquo; searches
(as we have been doing until now), &ldquo;and&rdquo; searches (in which all
of the words must appear) and &ldquo;or&rdquo; searches (in which one or more
of the words must appear).</p><p>To implement an &ldquo;and&rdquo; search, we break the elements of
phrase apart by using Perl's &ldquo;split&rdquo; operator. We then count the
number of words we must find, iterating over each of them and
checking to see if they all exist in <b  >$contents</b>.
If <b  >$counter</b> reaches <b  >0</b>, we can
be sure all words appear:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
elsif ($search_type eq "and")
  {
    my @words = split /\s+/, $pattern;
    my $count = scalar @words;
    foreach my $word (@words)
    {
    $count- if ($contents =~ m|\b$word\b|is);
    }
    unless ($count)
    {
    print qq{&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="$url"&gt;$filename&lt;/a&gt;\n};
    $total_matches++;
    }
  }
</pre><p>An &ldquo;or&rdquo; search is even easier to implement: once again, we
break apart <b  >$phrase</b> across white space. If even
one of the constituent words matches, we can immediately print the
file name and hyperlink, and return from find_matches:
<pre     class="programlisting">
elsif ($search_type eq "or")
  {
    my @words = split /\s+/, $pattern;
    foreach my $word (@words)
    {
    if ($contents =~ m|\b$word\b|is)
    {
    print qq{&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="$url"&gt;$filename&lt;/a&gt;\n};
    $total_matches++;
    return;
    }
    }
  }
</pre>


Finally, we should have some way of telling the user how many
documents matched. We do this by creating a new variable,
<b  >$total_matches</b>, which is incremented each time a
document matches (as seen in the above code fragments for &ldquo;and&rdquo;
and &ldquo;or&rdquo; searches).
</p><p>These improvements are incorporated into the search program
called better-cgi-search.pl, in Listing 9, not printed here but
contained in the archive file (see Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x1367990"></a>Excluding Directories and Files</h2></div></div><p>We now have a fairly full-functioned search program which can
handle most types of searches people want to do. The problem is
that we have created a program which might be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> good to be useful. Many clients of mine
put information on their web sites before it is meant to be
released. Without any links leading to these directories and
documents, it is unlikely someone will be able to find them.
However, our search program does not depend on hyperlinks in order
to find documents.</p><p>One common solution is for a search program to ignore any
directory containing a file named .nosearch. This file does not
need to contain any data, since its mere existence means a
directory's contents will be skipped.</p><p>The easiest implementation would check for the existence of a
.nosearch file in the directory currently being probed. However,
checking for a file with each invocation of find_matches would
reduce our program's already slow performance even more. It would
be better if the program looked for a .nosearch file, then stored
that information in a hash to be retrieved when future files in
that directory are examined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x1367ba0"></a>The Other Problem</h2></div></div><p>We can solve these problems with two lines of code. The
first, placed at the beginning of find_matches, returns immediately
if a .nosearch file has already been found in the current
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
return if ($ignore_directory{$File::Find::dir});
</pre><p>If we reach the second line, it means that no .nosearch file
has been found for this directory. However, there are several
circumstances under which a .nosearch file wasn't found, yet should
still be in force: when we are examining the .nosearch file itself,
when a .nosearch file is in the directory or when a .nosearch file
is in the parent directory. After all, if the parent directory
should not be searched, then neither should the child directory.
Here is the code fragment that accomplishes this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Mark the directory as ignorable ...
    $ignore_directory{$File::Find::dir} = 1
        if (($_ eq ".nosearch") ||
            (-e ".nosearch") ||
            (-e "../.nosearch"));
</pre>


Listing 10 contains a version of better-cgi-search.pl with these
additions and can be found in the archive file (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1276580.0x1367db0"></a>Is This Any Way to Run a Search?</h2></div></div><p>If you have already run these programs, you most likely found
the main problem with the system outlined above: it is very slow.
If your web site contains 100 files, this system works just fine.
However, if your site expands to 1000 or 10,000 files, users will
stop the search in the middle because it will take too long.</p><p>For this reason, most serious search engines employ a
different strategy, one which separates the searching into two
different stages. In the first stage, an indexing program takes the
files apart, keeping track of where they might be. A second program
is then run as a search client, looking through the pregenerated
index for matches.</p><p>Next month, we will examine some ways of creating such
indices, as well as how to look through them. Perhaps our simple
search programs will not be able to complete with Glimpse and
ht://Dig, but at least we will understand roughly how they work and
what trade-offs are involved when writing search programs.</p></div></div>
