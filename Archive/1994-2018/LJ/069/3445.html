The subtitle, &ldquo;Code with Commentary&rdquo;, is apt. The book is full of
clearly explained code. Studying such annotated examples of
practical code is an ideal way to learn a language or increase
one's knowledge of a language. The author takes a cross-platform
approach, which is nice to see. Even though most of the examples
are inevitably UNIX-based, some code is also demonstrated for
fixing NT and Macintosh problems. The usual CD with code examples
is included. One minor annoyance is the lines are terminated with
&ldquo;CRLF&rdquo;, but I suppose it's easier for Linuxers to deal with this
than for those using NT to handle bare newlines.</p><p>The book is divided into four parts. It begins with &ldquo;Text
Processing&rdquo;, which also serves as a basic introduction to Perl.
This section starts by rounding up the usual filters, then examines
simple file manipulating, and concludes with various types of text
database work. After that, &ldquo;Networking and E-mail&rdquo; does a good
job of illustrating and explaining Perl's excellent support for
network programming. Part 3, &ldquo;World Wide Web&rdquo;, covers the ground
one would expect: HTML munging and CGI scripts. The CGI coverage
ranges from simple examples to an entire on-line shopping
application. Finally, &ldquo;Administrator's Toolkit&rdquo; supplies a useful
set of tools for systems and network administration. All in all, 11
chapters, with over a hundred clearly and closely explained
scripts&mdash;there is nothing I can find fault with here.</p><p>I have one issue to raise, however. That is, &ldquo;everything
with Perl&rdquo; is not always the best way. While one can hardly fault
a book about Perl for taking this approach, I would still like to
see more emphasis on how Perl can co-operate with existing UNIX
utilities. For example, my ISP uses dynamic IP addressing, so when
I need to find out what my IP address is this time, I use a little
shell script that reads as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ifconfig | grep ppp -A1 | domain.pl | head -1
</pre><p>Where domain.pl is the following script:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -n
while (m/(([-a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[-a-zA-Z0-9]+)(\.[-a-zA-Z0-9]+)*)/g) {
    print "$1\n";
}
</pre>


I know this doesn't cover all cases, but it works where required. I
guess I <span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> have implemented the whole
pipeline in Perl; but for me, and I suspect many other UNIX users,
it is easier just to bolt a few tools together than to write a
program, even in a language as easy to get started in as Perl. Why
reinvent the wheel? Much better to use Perl as part of the UNIX
toolkit, not to replace it.
</p><p>In conclusion, as Perl is best-known as the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that
holds many web sites together, this book, if aimed at any specific
audience beyond Perl learners and users, it is aimed at the web
site administrator or programmer. However, it is well worth reading
by anyone interested in Perl.</p></div></div>
