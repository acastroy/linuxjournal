    Eric takes a serious look at what the world will be like
    when Linux is the dominant operating system&mdash;or is he just
    kidding?
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3676f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9c500"></a></h2></div></div><p> World domination. It's a powerful and
faintly sinister phrase, one you might imagine some B-movie mad
scientist muttering as he puts the finishing touches on some
infernal machine amidst a clutter of bubbling retorts and crackling
Tesla coils. It is not a phrase you would, offhand, associate with
cuddly penguins.
</p><p>When Linus says he aims at world domination, it seems as if
he wants you to laugh at the absurd image of a gaggle of scruffy
hackers overrunning the computing world like some invading
barbarian horde&mdash;but he's also inviting you to join the horde.
Beneath the deadpan self-mockery is dead seriousness&mdash;and beneath
the dead seriousness, more deadpan self-mockery. And on and on, in
a spiraling regress so many layers deep that even Linus probably
doesn't know where it ends, if it ends at all.</p><p>The way Linux hackers use the phrase &ldquo;world domination&rdquo; is
what science-fiction fans call a &ldquo;ha-ha-only-serious&rdquo;. Some
visions are so audacious, they can be expressed only as ironic
jokes, lest the speaker be accused of pomposity or megalomania. It
is in much the same spirit that I sometimes describe myself as
Linus' Minister of Propaganda, as if I were some evil communist
bureaucrat in a campy remake of Orwell's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>1984</em></span>.</p><p>Such conscious self-subversion can serve many purposes.
There's a touch of Zen in it&mdash;a reminder from ourselves to
ourselves not to take our desires so seriously that we stop
noticing reality. It's also tactically valuable. Like the cuddly
penguin mascot, it invites our most dangerous adversaries not to
take us seriously. They're serious-minded people themselves, too
caught up in competitive testosterone games to have any room for
Zen. When they hear &ldquo;world domination&rdquo;, they don't hear the
irony, and thus tend to write us off as nutcases or flakes. That's
good; it gives us time and room to blindside them.</p><p>Of course, articles like this are part of that game. We
hackers are a playful bunch; we'll hack anything, including
language, if it looks like fun (thus our tropism for puns). Deep
down, we <span   class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> confusing people who are
stuffier and less mentally agile than we are, especially when
they're bosses. There's a little bit of the mad scientist in all
hackers, ready to discombobulate the world and flip authority the
finger&mdash;especially if we can do it with snazzy special
effects.</p><p>So, &ldquo;World domination now!&rdquo; we declaim, grinning at the
hapless suits and wondering which ones are smart enough to be in on
the joke. Because, of course, a world of mostly Linux machines
wouldn't really be a domination at all. Linux has no stockades, no
guard towers, no barbed wire, and no End User License Agreement
saying you can't modify and can't look inside and don't have any
kind of title to the bits on your own disks. When Linux
&ldquo;dominates&rdquo;, there won't be any predatory monopolies bluffing,
bribing and bullying competitors to protect the market for their
own overpriced and shoddy software. When Linux &ldquo;dominates&rdquo;,
software consumers and developers will win big&mdash;and only the kind
of people for whom domination really does mean controlling other
peoples' choices will lose.</p><p>That's a future worth working for. Linux world domination
means no domination anywhere&mdash;a statement which is ironic in the
strict rhetorical sense (&ldquo;expression of something which is
contrary to the intended meaning&rdquo;) but dead serious all the same,
and no regress need apply.</p><p>No domination anywhere, but rather a rich ecology of
competing projects and distributions and customizations, each one
of which constantly brings its own improvements to the globally
shared code base. A world not of closed pseudo-standards that lock
people in, but rather of true open standards that enable humans and
programs to cooperate in ever-richer ways. A world not of lock-step
uniformity and five-year road maps, but rather one of rapid
evolution and variation and flexibility and almost instant market
responsiveness to user needs. A world in which programming means
solving new problems every day, instead of wastefully repeating
work that somebody else locked up and hid away. A world in which
play becomes the highest form of work, and vice versa.</p><p>The future of &ldquo;no domination anywhere&rdquo; will be a better
world; not a perfect one, but perhaps the best that we, working as
designers and programmers, can hope to create. So if you aren't yet
part of our barbarian horde, join us! There's a lot of working and
playing to be done in order to get from here to there. It won't be
hard to find us; we'll be the mob yelling &ldquo;World domination
<span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>!&rdquo;--and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>smiling</em></span>.</p></div></div>
