although I usually do. I am occasionally reminded that computers,
or at least PCs, are as ubiquitous as they are because people like
to relax and play games. Most of us have heard of, if not played,
<span   class="bold"><b>freeciv</b></span>, the Civilization clone.
But the real Civilization (Call to Power), one of several titles
released for Linux by Loki Games, is well beyond freeciv. Does that
mean great graphics or game play is restricted to commercial
ventures? As I think you'll see with the first two titles below,
this is simply not the case. Good games are needed. Educational
ones would be even better&mdash;let's get the kids involved with Linux,
too.
</p><p>X Ship Wars:
<a href="http://fox.mit.edu/xsw/index.html" target="_self">fox.mit.edu/xsw/index.html</a></p><p>This is a fun game similar to, but more complex than, the old
&ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; game. It has very nice visuals. The basic
instructions would have you believe you can just install the
client. In fact, while that is true, you also need to connect to a
server. There are several available, but you'll want to build and
install a server just so you can invite your friends over to be
knocked off by you, while you still have the edge. Play takes place
over any TCP/IP network. It requires libm, libX11, libXpm, libXext
and glibc.</p><p>GTK Puyo Puyo:
<a href="http://chaos2.org/xpuyopuyo" target="_self">http://chaos2.org/xpuyopuyo/</a></p><p>This amusing game is a multiplayer game in the Tetris genre.
You can play against another human or an AI. The AI has many
levels, from extremely unskilled to extremely competent. Instead of
filling rows completely with various shaped blocks, the blocks are
always in twos, but will vary in color. Your objective is to get
groups of four or more colors to match in any combination of left
to right or up and down. As you or your opponent get matches, the
other will get grey blocks to interfere with play. It requires
libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm,
libXpm and glibc.</p><p>CPAN:
<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-authors/Andreas_Koenig/CPAN-1.50.tar.gz" target="_self">www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-authors/Andreas_Koenig/CPAN-1.50.tar.gz</a></p><p>For Perl aficionados, this is a great way to keep up on the
latest Perl modules from CPAN, or even grab a new module. It is not
the easiest install around, as your initial contact will require
loading an index; but once that's done, you're good to go. First
bundle I had to get was libnet, because CPAN complained I didn't
have it, and it wanted to use it. Once you get the hang of this,
you won't want to be without it. It requires Perl.</p><p>irm:
<a href="http://www.redshift.com/~yramin/atp/irm" target="_self">http://www.redshift.com/~yramin/atp/irm/</a></p><p>The IT Resource Manager is a good tool for tracking hardware
and trouble tickets. The baseline for the database is a unique
<span   class="emphasis"><em>irm</em></span> number given to each system. Users can
submit trouble tickets via the Web if they know the system's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>irm</em></span> number (although most would rather pick up
a phone, in my experience). This has good support for a number of
areas and is a worthy competitor to MOT. It requires Apache (or
another PHP-capable web server), PHP3 and MySQL.</p><p>ssh buddy:
<a href="http://www.sundilla.net/sshbuddy" target="_self">http://www.sundilla.net/sshbuddy/</a></p><p>I use <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> habitually. In
fact, anyone who uses <span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> or
the <span   class="bold"><b>r</b></span> commands must not be
connected to the Internet, or else they don't care about security.
I'll not belabor my disappointment over the license change on ssh
2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. I will tell you that this graphical
client makes connections easier than ever. This will save any
administrator time in connecting to servers, and the more servers
you have to connect to via ssh, the more time this will save you.
If you haven't had time to implement
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh-agent</b></span>, this is the next best
thing. It requires expectk and ssh client.</p><p>aide:
<a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html" target="_self">www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html</a></p><p>For those who are familiar with Tripwire, this package is
meant to replace it with an equivalent under the GPL. Tripwire has
been removed from the public domain, and while the older version
1.3 is still good (version 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> is the current,
proprietary version), it's getting more difficult to build with
changes in the system libraries. Aide is already doing as much as
Tripwire, and plans to do even more. As a replacement for Tripwire,
this shows much promise. It's already running for me as a cron job
on one system where Tripwire 1.3 would not compile. It requires
glibc.</p><p>Web Downloader for X:
<a href="http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chechelo" target="_self">http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chechelo/</a></p><p>Got a lot of files you'd like to grab from the Internet?
Doesn't matter if they're web pages or FTP files; you can start
multiple transfers from the same site. This will probably be of
more interest to those with cable modems or fast Internet
connections. If you have twenty or thirty items to download, this
utility will make multiple connections. It will also allow you to
specify a maximum number of connections. It's all packaged in a
nice-looking GTK GUI. This GUI will allow you to schedule downloads
as well. It requires libpthread, libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule,
libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libstdc++, libm and libc.</p><p>brass monkey:
<a href="http://personal.bellsouth.net/lig/z/z/zztzed/brassmonkey" target="_self">http://personal.bellsouth.net/lig/z/z/zztzed/brassmonkey/</a></p><p>This particular piece of software functions like the comment
page on Slashdot. If you have the password, you can start a new
thread and others can add comments&mdash;many possibilities here.
Perhaps I should put each of the blurbs from this column on a web
site and invite comments. It requires Apache (or another
PHP-capable web server), PHP3 and MySQL.</p></div></div>
