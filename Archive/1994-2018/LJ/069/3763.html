comments that were (and still are) net-accessible. Since 1996,
several of his essays (most notably &ldquo;The Cathedral &amp; the
Bazaar&rdquo;) have become required reading. If anything, the obloquy
heaped on Raymond by the PR folks in Redmond, WA (e.g., in the
&ldquo;Halloween documents&rdquo;) has made him more important.</p><p>O'Reilly has done us all a good favor by collecting a number
of Raymond's pieces and making them readily accessible at a price
everyone can afford.</p><p>The volume contains &ldquo;A Brief History of Hackerdom&rdquo;, &ldquo;The
Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar&rdquo;, &ldquo;Homesteading the Noosphere&rdquo;, &ldquo;The
Magic Cauldron&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Revenge of the Hackers&rdquo; and &ldquo;Afterword&rdquo;,
plus two appendices.</p><p>These are the &ldquo;commonsense&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Federalist papers&rdquo;
for the Open Source movement. They are the testimony of just why
the BSDs and Linux, Perl and Python, Tcl and Java are successful:
we have tens of thousands of programmers all over the world
contributing to the excellence of programs and systems. We don't
have an encapsulated proprietary system which no one can
debug.</p><p>When I was writing <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Quarter Century of
UNIX</em></span> (Addison-Wesley, 1994), I realized that essential
to the &ldquo;UNIX philosophy&rdquo; was something alien to commercial
programming: the changes to the kernel, the applications and the
programs were all written by one or two or three hackers, not by
teams of programmers. Eric Allman wrote Sendmail; Mike Lesk wrote
the original <span   class="bold"><b>uucp</b></span> (even the
mid-1980s version, HoneyDanBer, was by Peter Honeyman, Dan Nowitz
and Brian Redman); Steve Johnson wrote
<span   class="bold"><b>yacc</b></span>; Bill Joy wrote
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>, etc. Brian Kernighan once told
me AWK was the toughest project he ever worked on &ldquo;because there
were three of us&rdquo; (Aho, Weinberger and Kernighan).</p><p>Of course, it's all the Internet's fault. Even with the
semi-annual USENIX tape-swaps and uucp, stuff passed about more
slowly. It's the Net that enabled a Finnish student to send his
work to nearly every corner of the world and enabled thousands to
contribute and feed stuff back to him.</p><p>In some ways, &ldquo;The Magic Cauldron&rdquo; is my favorite essay of
Raymond's. Here, he shows that he understands the underlying
economic reasons for the success of open software. This
understanding is based on the anthropological study of gift
exchanging and the concepts of what happens in a gift culture when
&ldquo;survival goods are abundant&rdquo;, and therefore, the exchange is no
longer interesting.</p><p>This is tied together with the notions inherent in the fact
that software has two distinct values: use value and sales value.
As Raymond says, use value is value as a tool; sales value is value
as a salable good. One of Raymond's most interesting discussions is
founded in this.</p><p>Food, equipment and books all retain value independent of the
producer. If a farmer sells his farm, the food produced retains its
value, etc. When a computer manufacturer (hardware or software)
goes out of business or a line is discontinued, the price users are
willing to pay plummets. The price users will pay is limited by
&ldquo;the expected future value of vendor service&rdquo;.</p><p>Open-source software forces the vendor into a world of
service-fee-domination and exposes &ldquo;what a relatively weak prop
the sale value of the secret bits in closed-source software was all
along&rdquo;.</p><p>The true advantage for all of us lies in the notion of
high-quality software being built upon by the community, rather
than being locked up in a vault or discontinued.</p><p>Raymond believes that in 2000/2001, Linux will be &ldquo;in
effective control of servers, data centers, ISPs and the Internet,
while Microsoft maintains its grip on the desktop&rdquo;. Most likely,
that's correct. But with the advent of products like StarOffice and
WordPerfect for Linux, there may well be inroads into the desktop
market as well.</p><p>This is a fine, thought-provoking book that should be read by
anyone interested in computing: open, academic or
proprietary.</p></div></div>
