    for this first issue of the year 2000.

month's issue is Networking and Communications, we also wanted to
feature &ldquo;World Domination&rdquo; for this first issue of the year 2000.
To do that, we invited Eric Raymond to write an editorial for us
and asked permission of Aardman Animations to use their penguin,
Feathers McGraw, on our cover. Both graciously consented, and both
are fun to have in our magazine.
</p><p>As it has been said many times, this is the &ldquo;age of
communication&rdquo;, and the growth of the Internet has proved it. More
and more people are reaching out to get in touch with others all
over the world, using their computers. With the right equipment and
software, you can call internationally without paying long-distance
fees to the phone company, and see the person you are calling on
your computer screen. This can be done using Linux. In the business
world, communication with others, as well as keeping track of what
they are doing, must be fast and efficient. E-mail service and the
Internet provide that service in both cases. If the network is
down, we find ourselves wandering through the hallways until it is
back up, and we can resume contact with the outside world. In
enterprise today, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from the
rest of the world. Our networks must provide the secure
communication channel we need to stay on top.</p><p>This month, our feature articles cover Internet Telephony,
advanced packet testing and the features of the new release of
BIND. We also have Part 2 of David Morgan's series on virtual
private networking, and the real-world story of a company that
provides audio and video streaming over the Internet. And don't
forget &ldquo;Strictly On-Line&rdquo;, where we have an article describing
how to hold company meetings in the virtual world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf1b580.0x1013450"></a><i  >LJ</i> Archive CD</h2></div></div><p>Our latest <i  >Linux Journal</i> archive CD is
