needed utility or responsible for a team developing the next Linux
killer application, Cygnus' Source-Navigator can add value to your
software project. Source-Navigator (SN) is an extendable source
code editor, organizer and analysis tool. SN can be used for
creating, maintaining, reengineering or reusing code, understanding
complex application code relationships or assisting with
source-code configuration management.
</p><p>There are at least two different ways in which this software
tool can be used. Let's say you've just received maintenance
responsibility for a legacy application with thousands of lines of
code. The application's documentation is minimal, and source-code
documentation is slim. How can one perform code archaeology to
learn about the application's structure, functions, include
relationships and other code interdependencies? Converting it into
an SN project could go far toward building a foundation for
understanding the code. Perhaps you've been assigned the task of
managing development of the next Linux killer application. This
assignment includes ensuring code reuse, tracking modifications,
implementing source-code version control and keeping development
teams focused on their portion of the development effort. SN can be
used to achieve these objectives. In the next few paragraphs, I
will highlight the various tools, browsers and editors that can be
used to achieve these objectives.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3706f1.large.jpg"><img src="3706f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Symbol Browser</p></div></div>
</p><p>Source-Navigator's main work environments are divided into
the Symbol Browser and the Editor Window. I think of the Symbol
Browser as an overview tool (see Figure 1). Every project opens
with the Symbol Browser. This provides a listing of the project's
directories, files, methods, functions and classes. It is possible
to display lists of virtually any symbol or source files with this
browser. A symbol list can be set to display a single symbol or any
combination of symbols. Generally, information on symbols is
presented as a two- (or more) column list.</p><p>Notice the four right-most toolbar buttons. These are labeled
from left to right: Class, Methods, Functions and Files. Choosing
the File button lists all of the application's files, their file
type and location. Selecting the Methods button will list all
methods, their class, type and associated file location. The Class
and Function buttons provide similar lists of class and function
information. The four left-most buttons provide hyperlink access to
the Hierarchy, Class, Cross-Reference and Include browsers. With a
click of a button, these browsers provide more details about the
selected symbol.</p><p>I created a software project with some C++ code I had never
seen. After spending a few minutes with the Symbol Browser, I had a
feel for what classes, methods, functions and files belonged to the
application. After spending some more time with this tool, it
became clear which classes, methods and functions were contained in
which file(s). Having learned these relationships, I found myself
wanting to print out a couple of the Symbol Browser's lists.
Unfortunately, this release did not offer a print capability from
the Symbol Browser.</p><p>Burrowing further into application details requires tools for
dissecting and mapping specific code, file and symbol
relationships. These tools are contained in the Editor Window. This
window is the home of the Hierarchy, Class, Cross-Reference and
Include browsers. Editor Window browsers are normally displayed as
a single window. If needed, a browser window can be split to
present two browsers within the same window. In addition to the
four browsers, the Editor Window contains two text-pattern search
tools and an editor. The Editor Window also includes the ability to
look at something previously selected, relationships, files or
symbols. These &ldquo;views&rdquo; are accessible through a project history
list. The project history list is maintained on a per-tool basis.
The Editor Window can also be used to set up projects, add and
delete source files or directories, and organize and segment views
of source files. The Editor window and its major parts are shown in
Figure 2.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3706f2.large.jpg"><img src="3706f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Editor Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>Understanding an application involves breaking the software
into manageable chunks. These chunks can take the form of files,
objects, code symbols, coding constructs or algorithms. Usually
there is some kind of predetermined interrelationship between these
application components. The Cross-Reference browser provides a
means of graphically examining these relationships in a
hierarchical tree format. For example, selecting a function and
then the Cross-Reference browser (X-Ref) will display a tree of
function calls. This tree can provide a point of view that shows
calling functions higher in the tree and functions being called
lower in the tree. Selecting the X-Ref browser and a method
produces a similar tree, illustrating the variables, methods,
classes and functions related to the method. Similar hierarchical
trees are displayed when the X-Ref is used with classes. I believe
one of SN's better attributes is its ability to diagram
relationships.</p><p>Some languages allow other files to be included as part of
the current file. Examining a file's <b  >#include</b>
statements provides a backward view of which files are being
included in the selected file. Seldom does a file provide a list of
files in which it is being included. The Include browser provides
both a forward and a backward graphical picture of the various
include file relationships. This browser shows which files are
included in the selected file. It also shows which files include
the selected file. Include relationships can be illustrated by this
browser range from a simple one-to-one relationship to a complex
many-to-many relationship.</p><p>Inheritance relationships between classes and objects are
displayed in the Hierarchy browser. Like with the X-Ref browser,
this information is displayed as a hierarchical tree. Three
hierarchical views can be selected in this browser. One view
displays the entire class hierarchy. There is a view that shows
only the selected class and its related sub- and super-classes.
Another view displays only the selected class and the related
super-classes.</p><p>The Class browser can be used with either object-oriented or
conventional languages (C, COBOL, etc.). This browser uses two
window panes to display information. The Inheritance Tree pane
displays relationships between the class selected for browsing and
any related base or super-classes. A Member List pane lists members
of the classes shown in the Inheritance Tree pane. Selecting or
deselecting class names in the Tree pane will modify the members
shown in the member's list. A member filter is included in this
browser. The member list filter provides a way of displaying
members meeting specific criteria. For example, the filter can be
used to list only methods which have been overridden from a base
class.</p><p>The included Editor provides typical editing capabilities,
plus a couple of other services. The symbol-accelerator drop-down
list contains either all symbols in the entire application or only
those in the open files. Selecting a symbol from the list advances
the editor to the appropriate file and highlights the symbol. SN's
hyperlinking feature causes all other browsers to automatically
prepare to display their information for the same symbol. If you
wish, SN can be told to use your favorite editor instead of the
default editor.</p><p>SN contains two more features. One is its ability to
interface with debugging and programming tools. The other feature
is version control support. The Tools Menu provides the Make and
Debugger options. Existing projects' Makefiles can be run from
within SN. The SN Make dialog box contains a
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command field, a working
directory field and an output window. Output from the make run is
displayed in this window. Any compiler error messages displayed in
this window can be used to open the SN editor. After the editor is
opened, the cursor is placed on the line containing the error.
Command-line compilers can be used with SN. The &ldquo;Programmer's
Reference Guide&rdquo; provides information on how to integrate
command-line compilers.</p><p>The GNU Debugger is used by SN to debug a program. Selecting
the debugger menu option displays the &ldquo;Program to Debug&rdquo; dialog
box. The debugger can be started once the program name and working
directory have been entered. If you have the correct version of GDB
debugger, SN will be able to open and display the source file when
a problem occurs.</p><p>Managing software projects often involves revision and
version control. With version control, one has the option of
managing versions, version history, labels and related documents.
SN's Edit Menu provides a graphical interface to four external
version control systems. Each of these four products has already
been integrated with SN. You must have one of them installed on
your platform before SN can use it. On the non-commercial side, you
can select either the Revision Control System (RCS), Concurrent
Versions System (CVS) or Source Code Control System (SCCS). The
fourth choice is a commercial version control product called
ClearCase. All systems provide the basic checkout with lock,
checkout without lock, check-in, check-in with lock, change
description, file comparison and discard changes functionality. I'm
not familiar with ClearCase. Since it is a commercial product, it
may possess additional functionality.</p><p>Version control in a distributed environment implies all
developers are ultimately checking code in and out of the same code
repository. Several techniques for sharing file systems are
available. In my current setup, I was unable to review how the
product behaves in a shared version control environment.</p><p>Printing definitely requires a PostScript printer. Depending
on the printer/plotter capabilities, SN can print on several paper
sizes. Supported paper sizes range from 8.5 by 11 inches to 42 by
59.5 inches. The print dialog box provides several additional
options including image scaling, pagination, paper orientation and
print color. Your printer's capabilities will determine which
options you can use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfaa580.0x10a34d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>SN Developer and Enterprise Editions are supported on at
least Sun Solaris 2.5.1, SuSE 6.0/6.1 or Red Hat 6.0. It is also
supported on Wintel platforms running NT 4.0 and Windows 95/98. The
Enterprise Edition is also supported on HP-UX 10.20. Literature
indicated SN should run on the Caldera Linux distribution. The
platform used in this review used the Caldera v1.3 and v2.2 Linux
distributions.</p><p>By default, the product is installed under the installer's ID
in the installer's home directory. An option to install the
Source-Navigator product according to your product install
conventions is provided.</p><p>Source-Navigator is a breeze to install. First, start the
install script from within the X environment. Next, enter the
desired target installation directory and identify how any problem
reports will be sent to Cygnus. The option of installing a
demonstration project is offered once the above choices have been
made. Any or none of the six demonstration projects can be selected
for installation. The tutorial is based on the C++ demonstration
project. A dialog keeps you posted on the install progress.</p><p>The product installed without problems the first time. On the
Caldera v2.2 install, some of the subdirectories and files had UID
and GID numbers that were nonexistent on my system. To correct
this, I assigned valid user and group IDs to the subdirectories and
files.</p><p>SN uses a network floating-license scheme to control product
access. I didn't find installing the license manager asset-key as
seamless as the install guide indicated. I had to manually create
the license file to include the asset-key information.</p><p>Running the license manager under Caldera v1.3 was
straightforward. It wasn't quite as smooth under Caldera v2.2. The
license manager wants to place a lock file in /usr/tmp. This
directory did not exist in my v2.2 installation. I chose to create
a soft link between /usr/tmp and /tmp. This link allowed the
license manager to create its lock file. On a side note, the
license-manager documentation doesn't recommend running the license
manager under the root ID.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfaa580.0x10a3790"></a>Documentation and Support</h2></div></div><p>Source-Navigator comes with a <span   class="emphasis"><em>User's
Guide</em></span> and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programmer's Reference
Guide</em></span>. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>User's Guide</em></span> clearly
presents installation instructions, contains a tutorial on creating
a project, and factually describes each of the Source-Navigator
browsers. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programmer's Guide</em></span> serves as a
reference for customizing and extending Source-Navigator
functionality. Descriptions and narrations in each of these manuals
are supported with screen captures. Where appropriate, sample code
is included in the manual.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Installation Guide</em></span> clearly presented
UNIX system memory, disk, X11 and printer requirements. Comparable
Wintel requirements are also given. I found the example of UNIX
memory utilization for startup, post-project creation and per open
browser informative. The Installation guidance also provided a rule
of thumb for estimating disk storage requirements on a per-project
basis. The default directory table leaves little doubt as to what
directories are being created and the type of files being placed in
the directories.</p><p>Cygnus uses GLOBEtrotter Software's FLEXlm to manage the SN
license. The User's Guide contained virtually no information on
starting, stopping or checking the current status of FLEXlm. The
only reference I could find about starting this license manager was
in the asset-key e-mail. A list of available commands and options
is displayed if you enter <span   class="bold"><b>lmutil</b></span>
at the command line without any options. More can be learned about
the FLEXlm license manager by going to the
<a href="http://www.globetrotter.com" target="_self">http://www.globetrotter.com/</a>
web site; there you will find a FLEXlm FAQ and a User
Manual.</p><p>There is a 17-page tutorial introducing project creation and
the basic use of each browser and editor. The User's Guide portion
of the manual provides more detail on each of the items covered in
the tutorial. I found the tutorial worth the time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfaa580.0x10a3c08"></a>Software Development Kit</h2></div></div><p>Out of the box, SN supports seven languages: C, C++, Tcl,
[incr tcl], FORTRAN, COBOL and assembly. An SDK is included with
the base product. Using the included SDK, one can modify the
graphical user interface, write a new parser to incorporate
additional languages, build applications to access the SN project
database and implement communications between SN and external
applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfaa580.0x109a5a0"></a>Two Editions</h2></div></div><p>The developer edition is designed for the single developer.
This edition can accommodate small- to medium-sized projects.
According to Cygnus literature, small- to medium projects are less
than 100,000 lines of source code. The Enterprise Edition of
Source-Navigator supports work groups and large projects. Projects
with more than 100,000 lines of code are considered large. The
maximum project size seems to be limited only by disk space and
system memory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfaa580.0x109a6a8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Whether doing code archaeology or building the next killer
application, this is one of those products that should be in every
tool kit. It can provide substantial support, structure and advance
software development efforts.</p><p>By the way, a fully functional evaluation copy of SN is
available from the Cygnus web site. Hopefully, I've piqued your
interest enough to download a copy and use it for the evaluation
period. It doesn't take long to see the possibilities.</p></div></div>
