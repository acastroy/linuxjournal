    A bank in Croatia is using Linux for its development
    platform. Here's the story.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d9e580.0x1e962f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>We are a small bank in a small country.
Up until two years ago, our management policy regarding software
was internal development&mdash;standard banking software price is about
$1 million, and we were small enough to handle internal
development. Our servers were Intel-based machines, running SCO and
Informix SE.
</p><p>Then management decided to change our business strategy, and
soon we started to grow very fast. In less than a year, the number
of employees doubled, and so did the number of PCs. Our LAN became
a WAN, and the number of transactions multiplied five times and
continues to grow. We could not ensure efficient software solutions
for all new requests, so the decision was made to buy commercial
applications. We also bought two IBM RS/6000 servers running AIX,
connected in a high-availability cluster.</p><p>A year later, this decision may not seem too smart. We have
our software, which handles 70% of our business, and a bunch of
applications, communicating between each other with shell scripts,
4GL and C programs that perform needed data conversions. But
development takes time, and we cannot employ a new application
without at least three months of extensive testing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d9e580.0x1e964a8"></a>How Linux Fits In</h2></div></div><p>More and more users needed Internet access, and we needed a
dial-on-demand router. We didn't want specialized hardware. We
wanted to be able to customise logs, schedule access time on a
per-user basis and use an existing PC for that purpose.</p><p>After a week running NT Workstation with WinGate demo, we
gave up. WinGate used to die two or three times a day. That would
not be a problem in and of itself, since it was a demo anyway, but
the COM port stayed locked every time it happened, remaining locked
until reboot. Obviously, NT did not release allocated resources
after process termination. Well, it did not look like a serious
operating system to us.</p><p>Linux came in our focus accidentally. A friend of mine did
quite a bit of advocacy and convinced me to try it, giving me
precise directions and a Slackware 3.2 CD. Why not? If it works,
fine; if it doesn't, it costs me nothing. After all, I am an
experienced UNIX administrator&mdash;I can do it. So I took a 486 with a
1GB SCSI disk and 16MB RAM and started to play with Linux.</p><p>A few hours after inserting the CD into the drive, I had a
working proxy, and I still have it. It has been working for a year
now. All we have to do with it are the usual administration jobs:
adding new users, kernel patches, etc. Furthermore, it became a
caching proxy and news server. To be quite specific, there is
<span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span>, socks5 proxy, caching DNS,
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpd</b></span>, Apache as caching HTTP proxy
and internal web server, and <span   class="bold"><b>inn</b></span>
as a news server for both local and Usenet newsgroups.</p><p>My colleagues were very suspicious of Linux, but started
respecting it after a few months of uptime.</p><p>After the initial experience, I was very pleased with Linux
and started to explore. As I discovered the purpose of the iBCS
module, I had to run the SCO version of Informix on it. So, I
copied Informix, our database and applications, tested it, and
again it worked from the first try. I even found Linux a better
development platform than SCO&mdash;it didn't require additional kernel
parameter tuning to run complex database queries, it worked faster
and was more stable, and it had better development tools.</p><p>Well, it's not quite fair to compare Linux to an obsolete
product (SCO 4.2), but I tested concurrent queries and updates on
millions of records, shut down the machine in the middle of work,
killed system processes such as
<span   class="bold"><b>kswapd</b></span>, tested power-off
behaviour, and even pulled off the IDE disk cable on the working
machine. Although I got database corruption, I didn't manage to
produce unrecoverable file system errors. When
<span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> failed,
<span   class="bold"><b>fsdebug</b></span> worked. For the record, we
had unrecoverable file system errors on SCO. The result is that we
now use Linux as our development platform.</p><p>Switching to Linux may not be easy for a Windows user, but we
are used to working in a UNIX environment. We have set up Linux on
a PC as a server for development and testing purposes and on three
developers' PCs instead of Windows. We used Windows mostly as a
task switcher for a few terminal sessions and for printer sharing.
The only reason we used it was that it came pre-installed on every
PC. Linux gave us additional possibilities: we have our native
development environment on every PC, with good development tools
such as Emacs, <span   class="bold"><b>ddd</b></span> and other good
stuff. Since we are used to GNU tools, we installed them on both
AIX and SCO. From a user's point of view, our AIX looks more like
Linux now.</p><p>It's hard to believe that you can get a good development
environment free when you used to pay thousands of dollars for one,
but it's true.</p><p>When our users wanted to share Windows files across the WAN,
we didn't even think about an NT Server, as Linux has already
proven its reliability. So, we installed Samba as a WINS server. We
did not set it up on AIX servers because they handle our critical
applications and we just don't want to experiment on them. Today we
use Linux/Samba for printer sharing, too, as it gives our UNIX
systems access to Windows print servers, and Windows workstations
access to UNIX printers. Basically, when a user wants to print
something from UNIX, he can either print to a dot matrix or laser
printer in the system room, or to a printer in his room, which may
be connected to his PC or Windows-shared. When he chooses a local
printer, the appropriate Windows print queue is determined by his
IP address.</p><p>When we realized Samba's possibilities, we wanted to
implement a centralized backup, based on the following idea: all
users have their accounts on the Linux box, their Windows boxes
mount their home directory upon startup, and all their documents
are saved on Linux. Most of our users don't even know where their
files reside; they just click on the icon and use the application,
so we could change the working directory for Windows applications
on every PC.</p><p>This policy has some other security considerations. First,
only the logged-in user can read documents. Second, we receive some
documents from the National Bank and other government organizations
as Microsoft Office files. Once we even received a macro virus with
them&mdash;it damaged only the user's local disk, but the user lost some
important files. Before that happened, we had not been worried
about viruses, since they come with cracked games, but now they may
come with business data. This way, we can also do periodic virus
scans, and file permissions are set in such a way that a user can
write to only his home directory, thus a potential virus can't
spread around. But we haven't fully implemented this yet, because
we have to change every PC's network settings to mount the Linux
drive and move all files to it. We also have problems forcing our
users to log onto Windows with their Linux user names and passwords
and explaining to them how to change the Windows password every
time their Linux password expires.</p><p>One day, we received a request to allow access to an old
Clipper application from a remote location. If we had just
installed it on the remote PC and mapped the network drive to our
machine, the Clipper database would go over the modem line, so we
would have to increase bandwidth. What's more important, we would
risk database corruption, and it's also the same story with
viruses, since we have no physical control over remote locations.
Linux took a role again; we installed the DOS Emulator. A few
smaller problems arose. Clipper is never idle, so DOSEmu takes all
available CPU time. Since we have only a few Clipper users, we just
gave DOSEmu a smaller priority. This way, only screens are
traveling the network, and with
<span   class="bold"><b>ttysnoop</b></span>, we can see exactly what
a user is doing. Also, there's no database corruption when Windows
dies&mdash;Linux doesn't die.</p><p>Linux has made our life much easier, especially on that
Monday morning when the hard disk on our SCO server didn't wake up.
We had no up-to-date database on our backup server, since the
previous weekend the entire bank moved to a new location. The
backup server was moved first, so there was no overnight database
copying. We had a tape backup, but it needs at least an hour and a
half to restore it. We had the Informix log file, which takes at
least the same time to roll forward the database. Luckily, we had
an up-to-date database on our development server; unfortunately,
copying over the network takes about an hour. Our customers were
waiting, so we chose to drive the bank on Linux for a day. The
server was not really a server but a PC with P133, 16MB RAM and an
IDE disk, so there was a lot of swapping, but most users didn't
notice any difference.</p><p>Today, Linux does quite a good job for us, and so do GNU
programs. Our complete development is done on Linux. C programs are
then recompiled with the GNU C compiler on either SCO or AIX; 4GL
programs are just copied to the proper place. Bash became our
standard shell on both AIX and SCO. CVS takes care of the version
control. Communication with remote locations is also handled by
Linux, and so is printer spooling. With the proxy, the internal web
and news, Linux played a significant part in our job. Anyway, it's
not yet ready to be used as the database and application server for
our purposes, because it still lacks a few features needed in our
mission-critical applications: the high-availability cluster
software and a journaling file system. We cannot afford any data
loss, and that's the main reason we have chosen AIX for certain
applications.</p><p>At the end of this year, we plan to migrate our database,
applications and development completely to AIX, so we'll stop using
SCO, but Linux will stay. It works very well and has greatly
improved our security and administration.</p></div></div>
