<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span>. To answer their questions and
those from people who didn't write, I drafted this response.</p><p>First, about the book. It is clearly put together by someone
who has been teaching Python to people. I would say the audience
has been experienced programmers, which at least for me, is
good.</p><p>Now, why Python? Is it the &ldquo;language of the future&rdquo;? I
think so. It makes a lot of sense in a lot of areas. Let me try to
address them.</p><p>Ease of learning: Python is a small language. That is, the
syntax is simple and the number of commands is fairly low.</p><p>Powerful: the power in Python (much like C) comes from its
library. While the language and its syntax aren't complicated,
calling the right function to do a task is what makes it powerful.
There are a lot of functions available, but you can acquire
knowledge of them as they are needed. For example, if you want to
do CGI programming, the functions available are powerful and
grouped so you can find them.</p><p>Being interpreted, you can quickly try things.</p><p>Python is extensible: if you have something you need to add
or something that must execute quickly, you can easily add code to
do it. Using C for things that need to be fast makes sense.</p><p>Python won't teach you any bad habits. There are virtually no
&ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; in the syntax, and I have yet to find a case where you
need to write a cute workaround to deal with a language
limitation.</p><p>Python is object-oriented, but in a nice way. I have dabbled
with C++ but have never actually done object-oriented programming.
Python encourages modular and object-oriented programming, but
doesn't require it. Thus, you can write a quick-and-dirty solution
to a one-time problem, but you can also write solutions to big
problems in an easy-to-read, easy-to-debut, easy-to-maintain way. I
contrast this with Perl, where you are encouraged to use the
quick-and-dirty solution and must go out of your way to create an
object-oriented solution.</p><p>Perl is a logical outgrowth of an assortment of UNIX tools
including <span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>, as well as shell scripting.
While Perl seems familiar to anyone who has used these tools, it
makes no sense for someone not familiar with these tools to
consider Perl. You can't even define the syntax of Perl, because it
doesn't really have any. Python, on the other hand, is
well-designed from a formal language sense as well as a programming
sense.</p><p>I hope this helps explain where Python fits or could fit in
your life.</p><p>&mdash;Phil Hughes info@linuxjournal.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2310580.0x2408710"></a>Linus, A Regular Guy</h2></div></div><p>I have been reading your interview with Linus whilst waiting
for our Internet connection to the outside world to be
restored&mdash;very, very fun read. I have no idea whether the world of
Linuxers is interested in this kind of &ldquo;human interest&rdquo; stuff or
not, but I know that it's great to hear this regular person talk
about himself, how he grew up, his ordinary life, etc. and not just
the usual Linux advocacy stuff, which Linus seems to avoid,
thankfully. This may be because he's less awed by it than everyone
else, since he put it together&mdash;wonderful modesty on his part.
Truly enjoyable journalism on yours.</p><p>&mdash;David Penn dvdpenn@yahoo.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2310580.0x2408870"></a>Trick or Treat</h2></div></div><p>Thanks very much for the great short article, &ldquo;Stupid
Programming Tricks&rdquo; by Jason Kroll in October's <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It introduced me to the world of SVGAlib. I
enjoyed his shapes.c program and even had fun changing it on my
own.</p><p>For the last month, I've been muddling through trying other
stuff, but had been eagerly awaiting the more impressive-looking
stuff you alluded to in last month's article. Alas, as I'm drooling
through my hot-off-the-presses edition of this month's
<i  >LJ</i>, I can't find any mention of console
graphics.</p><p>Do you plan on continuing the article in the future?</p><p>&mdash;Patrick A. Kirchner kirchner@csd.uwm.edu</p><p>Tricks was inadvertently dropped from layout in the November
issue. It resumed in December and will continue to be a regular
feature in upFRONT &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2310580.0x2408b88"></a>MS Breakthrough</h2></div></div><p>Upon reading the interview with Linus in the November 1999
issue, we've noticed that Microsoft has produced a new class of
computational analysis problems.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NP Completeness: all non-deterministic polynomial
problems are equivalent, we know we can solve them all, but not how
long it will take.</p></li><li><p>NT Completeness: all Windows NT boxes are

question is, how soon and what data will they take with them when
they go?</p></li></ul></div><p>Thanks for a world-class magazine about a world-class
phenomenon.

was concerned about security because the average user could read
the lilo.conf file and get the LILO passwords from it. Two
suggestions were to put the lilo.conf on floppy (reasonable) or
modify the source code of LILO (okay if you want to do much more
work than necessary).</p><p>The simplest solution is to just use
<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> on lilo.conf and its
directory. This is, in fact, what the LILO documentation says to
do.</p><p>&mdash;Michael James Obrien mobrien@unm.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2310580.0x2409160"></a>IBM Correction</h2></div></div><p>In the November article &ldquo;Using Java Servlets with Database
Connectivity&rdquo;, Bruce McDonald talks about IBM's Servlet Express.
The product is now called WebSphere and has been for quite some
time. WebSphere supports the newest versions of Apache and IBM HTTP
Server. If you are on the Windows NT platform, it supports even
more web servers. It seems your information on the IBM products is
