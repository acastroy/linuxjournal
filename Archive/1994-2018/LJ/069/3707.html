theory. Now let's pick up the VPN mini-HOWTO, study the script that
creates the VPN, run it, and explain what we see. The HOWTO
(<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini/VPN" target="_self">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/mini/VPN,
text version,</a> or
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/VPN.html" target="_self">metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/mini/VPN.html</a>)
is required reading for this article. The script, by Miquel van
Smoorenburg and Ian Murdock, is in section 4.10 of the HOWTO.
</p><p>The script runs on the local VPN server. If you configure
reciprocally, you can arrange to let it run from either side with
functionally equivalent results. What I call local/remote, Arpad
Magosanyi calls master/slave. For working purposes,
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> needs a remote user account
under which to log in. So, a remote user &ldquo;slave&rdquo;, which doesn't
correspond to any human user, is first created and configured
(permissions, keys).</p><p>The heart of the script embodies running
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>route</b></span> as described in Part 1
(section entitled The Network). With simplifications, here it is.
Line 33 is the centerpiece.</p><p>VPN HOWTO script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
line  1:  #! /bin/sh
line 19:  MYPPPIP=192.168.0.1
line 20:  TARGETIP=192.168.0.2
line 21:  TARGETNET=193.6.37.0
</pre><p>PPPD on both machines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
line 33:  /bin/pty-redir /usr/bin/ssh -o\
  'Batchmode yes' -t -l slave 206.170.217.204\
  /usr/local/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/pppd &gt;/tmp/device
line 34:  TTYNAME='cat /tmp/device'
line 39:  /usr/sbin/pppd $TTYNAME\
${MYPPPIP}:${TARGETIP}
</pre>


ROUTE on both machines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
line 45:  route add -net $TARGETNET gw $TARGETIP
line 46:  /usr/bin/ssh -o 'Batchmode\
yes' -l slave 206.170.217.204\
/usr/local/bin/sudo /home/slave/sshroute
</pre>


I numbered the lines, then deleted extraneous ones. For
readability, I also substituted shell variables and changed their
values to reflect real file and path names on my Red Hat 5.1
servers. Ignore <span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> in line
33&mdash;it is nothing more than a command filter/authenticator, a
mechanism you set up to allow some commands to run and disallow
others. It is here for additional security. It is set up to permit
pppd (HOWTO section 4.9), so its absence from line 33 would not
affect operations. When you read line 33, you should see
<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -t -l slave 206.170.217.204 pppd
</pre>


This says, &ldquo;get logged into the remote machine under its user
account 'slave' and run pppd; make the remote machine set up a
pseudo-terminal (<b  >-t</b>) as the destination for
output of this pppd process.&rdquo;

So far, it's working. Tracing through the log, sshd hears ssh. sshd
agrees to run the command requested by ssh (since I preconfigured
keys across the machines). The requested pppd command is then run,
which prepares to use an interface called ppp1 and associates it
with pseudo-terminal /dev/ttyp0. The process stopped there only
because pppd was never run from the other end; however, everything
here on the remote side went right. We'll see the process
consummated below when we run the full-blown script to completion.
</p><p>What's the difference between these two invocations? On the
remote side, nothing; the logs are the same. On the local side, in
the second invocation, the entire
<span   class="bold"><b>prior</b></span> command string was fed to
pty-redir and executed under its control, resulting in the garbage
going away, it seems. Actually, it just went elsewhere; pty-redir
&ldquo;redirects&rdquo; it. pty-redir is a short C language program by Mr.
Magosanyi. It identifies a pseudo-terminal device that is not in
use and opens it. Then it forces standard output&mdash;normally directed
to the console&mdash;to the pseudo-terminal instead. Anything the
program (ssh) would send to the console gets diverted to the
pseudo-terminal device.</p><p>Don't confuse this pseudo-terminal with the one created by
the <b  >-t</b> option&mdash;they're on different machines.
<b  >ssh -t</b> makes sshd on the remote side create a
pseudo-terminal over there, whereas pty-redir operates on the local
side. By number, both pseudo-terminals happen to be /dev/ttyp0 this
time, but that won't always be so. The local pseudo-terminal is
manifested above in the screen output, the remote one in the
log.</p><p>While it's nice to see the &ldquo;garbage in our face&rdquo; for
diagnostic purposes, it's better to keep it out of sight for
production purposes. That's why pty-redir was written. The
pseudo-terminal will prove convenient as the &ldquo;receiving vessel&rdquo;
for the incoming pppd output stream. We can launch a local pppd
into it in order to create the desired connection, instead of
having to do it more intrusively at our real terminal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10e3580.0x11dc160"></a>PPPD&mdash;a Different Kind of Daemon</h2></div></div><p>This is the place to contrast connections made by pppd versus
ssh and other daemons. The VPN uses both symmetrical and
asymmetrical connections to achieve &ldquo;tunneling&rdquo;.
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> is asymmetrical and uses the
TCP/IP service-port connections;
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> is symmetrical and uses
device-port connections.</p><p>The PPP HOWTO section 14, &ldquo;Setting up the PPP connection
manually&rdquo;, illustrates pppd's requirements. It has to run
simultaneously on both computers: the two output streams &ldquo;meeting
in the middle&rdquo;, so they can negotiate the connection setup.
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>'s output stream, visible
above, may look like garbage; however, it is pppd's signature and
is very meaningful to another copy of pppd. (The PPP HOWTO section
9.5 introduces &ldquo;ppp garbage&rdquo;.)</p><p>&ldquo;Meeting in the middle&rdquo; means getting opposite pppd's to
run over terminal or port devices (/dev/tty<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>)
that connect, with the output of each coming in as input to the
other. The idea is to get the incoming data stream fed into an
identifiable local device, then launch a local pppd into that same
device. The outgoing stream moves into the same &ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; from
which the incoming one emerges. Any available terminal or serial
port device will do. Since Linux provides /dev/ttypx
pseudo-terminals that are serial port emulators, they will work
just as well. That's essentially what the pty-redir program is
doing; it arranges for opposing pppd data streams to meet in the
middle. Once that happens, handshaking and negotiation ensue,
ultimately manifesting as a pppx interface viewable with the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command.</p><p>This highlights one big difference between pppd and other
daemons: symmetry. Last month, we said daemons belong to a matched
pair of distinct programs: one the client, one the server or
daemon. With pppd there's no distinction, i.e., no client. The
program pppd talks to is always another copy of pppd
<span   class="emphasis"><em>itself</em></span>, a conversation symmetrical with itself
rather than asymmetrical with a different program.</p><p>The other difference is that other daemons such as sshd talk
over TCP/IP connections involving TCP/IP ports.
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> talks over a connection and
uses ports too, but it builds its own kind of connection with its
own protocol, not TCP/IP. It uses port devices, not the numbered
service ports (sockets) of TCP/IP.</p><p>Since computers can multitask, TCP/IP provides for
simultaneous conversations between multiple pairs of processes on
any given pair of computers. The conversations are broken into data
packets. Each packet has a label (header) bearing the destination
computer's IP address and port number. Of the (possibly) many
conversations the destination computer might be conducting, the
port number identifies the one to which this packet belongs. A
conversation is uniquely defined by a set of four items in the
header: IP address at each end and TCP port number at each end. The
packets look like those in Figure 1 (simplified). See
&ldquo;Introduction to the Internet Protocols&rdquo; at
<a href="http://oac3.hsc.uth.tmc.edu/staff/snewton/tcp-tutorial" target="_self">http://oac3.hsc.uth.tmc.edu/staff/snewton/tcp-tutorial/</a>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3707f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1
</p></div></div><p>In the conversation logged above, we invoked ssh on the
command line and directed it to remote computer 206.170.217.204.
The first line in the remote log shows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Nov  7 20:21:43 localhost sshd[1406]: log: Connection from 206.170.218.30 port 1023
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> launched a packet to
sshd on the remote computer. <span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span>
is set up to &ldquo;reside&rdquo; at port 22, as ssh knows. The packet it
launched looked like that in Figure 2.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3707f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2
</p></div></div>

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> on remote port 22 heard
this and answered with packets of its own, swapping the above
destination and port values left to right. A conversation was
underway. The main order of business was encryption key negotiation
and authentication, but before getting into that, it looks like
sshd told ssh to change port numbers from 22 to 1406 (according to
that log entry, which is &ldquo;signed&rdquo; by sshd). Thereafter, a flurry
of packets like those shown in Figure 3 flew back and forth.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3707f3.large.jpg"><img src="3707f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3
</p></div></div><p>Certain server applications conventionally run on defined
port numbers, known publicly so that clients have a place to
contact them. These are called &ldquo;well-known&rdquo; or &ldquo;privileged&rdquo;
ports and range from 0 to 1023. (See /etc/services. Port 80 is
reserved for <span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>, for instance,
port 21 for <span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span>.) Once contacted,
servers often ask clients to switch port numbers to clear its
well-known port for other incoming conversations. Port 22 is the
main sshd switchboard. The operator there offloads you to another
line as quickly as possible (&ldquo;Please hold while I transfer you&rdquo;),
so she can handle other incoming calls.</p><p>It should now be clear that pppd could never use TCP/IP
service ports, since no TCP/IP connection generally exists when
pppd runs. The connection pppd has to work with is physical&mdash;a
phone line or direct serial cable. TCP/IP is a transport-layer
protocol. <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> (based on HDLC)
runs at the lower data-link communications layer, and pppd packets
are carriers or envelopes for TCP/IP (or other) packets. Because of
these fundamental differences, the overlapping references to
&ldquo;daemons&rdquo; and &ldquo;ports&rdquo; is unfortunate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10e3580.0x11d38b8"></a>Running the Full-Blown Script</h2></div></div><p><a href="3707l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Now let's run the script to automate and complete what we did
by hand. Here is a local screen capture:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@localhost /root]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/VPN start
setting up vpn
tty is /dev/ttyp1
[root@localhost /root]#
</pre><p>The simultaneous remote log is shown in Listing 1, which
shows that sshd agrees to run the command requested by ssh; sshd
puts the conversation on port 1022 this time. The requested command
(see VPN HOWTO script line 33) is sudo, not pppd. Within the remote
machine, sudo in turn runs pppd, which prepares to use an interface
called ppp2 and associates it with pseudo-terminal /dev/ttyp1. Just
about this time, somebody runs pppd at the local machine (see line
39). Two pppd's meet in the middle, and the local pppd (through
ssh, then sshd) tells the remote pppd what IP address numbers it
wants to use for each end of this connection. Remote pppd agrees,
and records those addresses in the log. At that point, the secure
link is in place, bilaterally. The script then proceeds to run
route. It informs each VPN server by address which additional
machines are available to be reached through the new connection
beyond the other server (i.e., the address of the network the
opposite server is on). In reaction to script line 46, the log
shows sshd reinvoked under new process ID number 1439, this time to
have sudo run <span   class="bold"><b>sshroute</b></span>, a script
(see end of HOWTO section 4.10) that contains the appropriate route
command.
</p><p>The dust has settled. The secure link is now in place. How
can we see and use it? It takes the form of a new PPP interface.
See it by running ifconfig. Use it by referring certain addresses
to it in the routing table (already done), then referring
applications to those addresses.</p><p><a href="3707l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> now shows two ppp
interfaces on each machine, old and new. A screen capture on the
local machine looks like that in Listing 2. A screen capture on the
remote machine is shown in Listing 3. Local-machine's ppp1 and
remote-machine's ppp2 are opposite ends of the same connection, or
interfaces to one another. This connection is the one just
constructed. Note interface number assignment is machine-specific,
and the numbers need not be identical. Local and remote ppp0, the
machines' respective ISP connections, aren't directly
related.</p><p><a href="3707l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>To refer to the other, each VPN server now has a choice of IP
addresses. Local-machine can still contact the remote machine at
its public Internet address 206.170.217.204, but has the additional
option of calling it 192.168.0.2. If the remote machine is running
a web server, for example, a browser on the local machine will pull
up exactly the same page by addressing itself to
http://206.170.217.204 or http://192.168.0.2. The remote machine
can be pinged using either address. To all appearances, our two ppp
interfaces seem independent and equivalent. Logically, they are,
and you can use them as if they were; physically, they are
not.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10e3580.0x11d3e38"></a>Envelopes inside Envelopes&mdash;Tunneling</h2></div></div><p>What's the difference? Primarily, that packets to 192.168.0.2
don't travel on the same footing as those to 206.170.217.204.
Rather, the former are carried as data &ldquo;freight&rdquo; inside the
latter. That's why I depicted the PPP connection as tributary to
the public ISP connection in the network diagram in Part 1. The
arrangement is called tunneling, because once freight packets
arrive at their destination, they emerge from their enclosing
packets as from a tunnel. They're released onto the destination
network as functional packets, not just passive data.</p><p>You may have noticed that the 192.168.0.0 IP addresses chosen
for the secure link belong to the &ldquo;reserved&rdquo; range prohibited for
use on the Internet (PPP HOWTO section 2), yet we are using these
on the Internet. Tunneling is what allows us to get away with it.
While on the Internet, packets bearing these addresses travel only
as data. The Internet need not route them according to those
addresses&mdash;they piggyback on packets addressed legitimately.</p><p>Tunneling enters the discussion of all VPN protocols. Some
reflect it in their name, such as Microsoft's PPTP or
Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol. Tunneling is a characteristic of
VPNs; if the data being tunneled also gets encrypted, you have a
VPN.</p><p>That's the other difference here&mdash;encryption. Ping packets
and web pages going to and from 192.168.0.2 get encrypted and
decrypted. Those going to 206.170.217.204, even though it is the
same place, do not. But you would not know about the encryption or
tunneling, because they're transparent. Since both are present,
this is a VPN.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10e3580.0x11d4048"></a>Routing&mdash;Completing the Picture</h2></div></div><p>I found the HOWTO's treatment of routing less than
comprehensive, perhaps beyond its intended scope. It goes as far as
informing each VPN server about the population of workstations on
the opposite network, but it doesn't teach those workstations the
reverse, and it doesn't provide for end-to-end awareness by
workstations on one network about the workstations on the
other.</p><p>The provided routing from the main script</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add -net 193.6.37.0 gw 192.168.0.2
</pre><p>puts an entry in the local VPN server's routing table that
says &ldquo;If you handle any packets whose address starts with
193.6.37, the clearinghouse for them is 192.168.0.2 (the remote VPN
server), send them to him. He'll know what to do with them&rdquo;, since
that's the address of the network to which he belongs.
</p><p>When I tried to ping a 193.6.37 from the local VPN server, it
failed. While I had a route to those machines, the problem was
their ignorance of a reverse route back to me. They got my ping
packets all right, but they couldn't answer back with a reply
packet because their routing table had never heard of
me&mdash;dead-letter office. So, I never saw the evidence of my
half-success.</p><p>There are two solutions. One, an entry in each of their
routing tables that points the way, unfortunately requires separate
adjustments on these multiple machines. The other requires a single
change at the remote VPN server, using the
<b  >proxyarp</b> option of pppd.</p><p>ARP (address resolution protocol) is for use in an Ethernet
environment. It's insufficient for workstations that talk over
Ethernet to know one another's IP address. The only way they can
trade TCP/IP packets is inside of Ethernet packets. Those go
nowhere unless the destination Ethernet (not IP) address is
known.</p><p>Machines maintain a directory for looking up a machine's
Ethernet address, given its IP address. (The Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>arp</b></span> command prints it.) If a
desired target IP isn't in your list, you automatically emit an ARP
broadcast to the network. If any other machine can come up with the
matching Ethernet address, it will send it to you.</p><p>The <b  >pppd proxyarp</b> command makes a
white-lie entry in the remote VPN server's directory that equates
the local VPN server's TCP/IP address with the remote VPN server's
Ethernet address. This fixed my ping problem. If the remote
workstations can get replies back to the remote VPN server, they
can certainly get them the rest of the way back to me at the local
VPN server. (See section 9 of &ldquo;Introduction to the Internet
Protocols&rdquo; for more about ARP.)</p><p>The other routing problem is that local and remote
workstations don't have routes to each other. The fix is an entry

(The second one works only if you invoked proxyarp when you ran
pppd.) For Microsoft machines on either net, give that net's VPN
server as the Gateway under TCP/IP properties.
</p><p>Now you are a VPN expert, so you also know the VPN is
worthless unless the computer where it runs is secured in other
ways. For instance, rsh and rlogin had better be disabled. ssh was
designed to replace them. If they're still hanging around, you have
one door double-bolted and another wide-open. Other services like
telnet and ftp should be turned off, too. You can do that in the
inetd.conf file. And, firewall rules should be deliberately
applied. Though beyond the scope of this article, these important
considerations require mention.</p><p><a href="3707s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
