Editor&rdquo; column was &ldquo;Linux 2000...&rdquo; The abstract goes on to say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I see Linux as a progressive movement as well as
an operating system. And, with any movement you need to chart your
direction. To help with that charting I decided that rather than
write the April, 1994 editorial I would just go ahead and write the
one for January, 2000.</p></blockquote></div><p>
  &ldquo;Well, here we are and it's time to see how well I did. If you don't happen to have issue #2, you can check out the original article <a href="../000/2001.html" target="_self">here</a>.&rdquo;

</p><p>My first idea, that Linux would turn into a movement to
provide affordable, reliable, multi-tasking software, was certainly
right on. Looks like my growth prediction was a bit off, though. I
estimated Linux would be in 100 million homes&mdash;seems a bit
high.</p><p>I also implied that few would remember an old program loader
called MS-DOS. Well, I think that has essentially happened. While
it continues to live under Windows, not many people seem to realize
it.</p><p>Another miss on my part was personal satellite stations in
the late 1990s. They exist&mdash;you can buy a system that offers a
bidirectional connection to the Internet&mdash;but the price of that
connection is still too high to be practical for personal
computing. What <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> happened is that the cost
of wired Internet connectivity, most specifically DSL and cable
modem, has offered significant bandwidth to many at a very low
cost.</p><p>I had some predictions about <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Specifically, I projected that 90% of our
subscribers would receive their magazines via the Internet rather
than on paper. This could have happened, if not for two reasons:
most readers want the print version of the magazine, and our
advertisers want you to see their ads. We do offer an electronic
version of the articles to our subscribers at
<a href="http://interactive.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">http://interactive.linuxjournal.com/</a>,
but we continue to print over 100,000 magazines each month.</p><p>I predicted two events that would make Linux a huge success.
The first was the formation of MoAmI Semiconductor, a company that
produced a chip where Linux was the first OS to run native. We're
still waiting on this one. Linux will most likely be the first OS
on Intel's Merced chip, with VA the first vendor to ship systems.
And, well, keep watching Transmeta.</p><p>The second event was Linux becoming the most popular OS in
computer science classes. I don't have the numbers, but it sure
seems like that could have happened.</p><p>I also predicted that NT would become a niche operating
system. Did it? We don't know yet, as its name is now Windows 2000
and, well, it really hasn't shipped yet. I still feel that most
corporate customers waiting for Windows 2000 will, once they see
it, decide Linux is the right answer for servers.</p><p>I also predicted those old Linux developers would still be
writing code or books on Linux, rather than being CEOs of
multi-billion dollar corporations. Generally, this seems to be
true, with some also writing articles for <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Why? Because these people are doing what they
want.</p><p>I'm fairly happy with how things have turned out. I took some
rather SWAGs (Scientific Wild Guesses) and wasn't totally out of
line. The good news is Linux is still here, you are still here, and
we are still here. Hopefully, the only big arguments of the next
five years will be about programming in Perl or Python and whether
to use GNOME or KDE on your Linux system.</p></div></div>
