    At Nortel Networks, we have developed a Linux-based system
    for testing a second-generation packet radio service. During
    system development we explored the details of packet radio,
    the IP internals of the Linux operating system and
    device-driver development.

ponder the sophisticated on-line articles at <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s web site? Nothing. The majority of the time
you are connected to the Internet, your modem sits idle. However,
your phone call ties up at least one dedicated circuit in a

this circuit's bandwidth is lost forever.
</p><p>Telephone company operators and manufacturers recognize that
forming data paths by switching fixed-capacity circuits is
inefficient. Interactive data communication is transmitted in
bursts. You pull down a web page and whimsically move on to the

the advanced second-generation digital cellular systems reserve a
channel intended for voice transmission when making data
connections. This scarce and wasted bandwidth, bought or leased
from the governments of the world, is a very expensive commodity to
lose while customers read web pages.</p><p><a href="3724s2.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p><p>If you only knew what was happening beneath that sleek,

</p><p>If you are traveling from Italy to France, it is likely that
your mobile phone is a Global System for Mobile communications
(GSM) cellular telephone. GSM is a worldwide second-generation
digital cellular standard. GSM offers many voice and short message
services such as calling line ID, call barring, call forwarding and
advice of charge. As shown in Figure 1, GSM's radio frequency (RF)
interface is comprised of 200KHz bandwidth carriers divided into
eight time slots. A time slot is one channel which can carry
digitally compressed voice at 13Kbps. On a data call, this same
time slot can carry up to 14.4Kbps of circuit-switched data.</p><p>The GSM standards body recognized the inefficiency inherent
in circuit-switched data and added a service called General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS) to the GSM standards. GPRS is a packet overlay
of the GSM network. Packet-switched technology efficiency greatly
exceeds circuit-switched technology efficiency for carrying and
delivering data.</p><p>In a packet-switched cellular network, the mobile telephone
shares the RF packet channels with the other mobiles in range of a
cell site. Rather than reserving a specific time slot or channel on
one of the base station's carriers for the entire session, the GPRS
mobile uses one or more packet channels to transmit or receive data
in bursts. Once the mobile finishes with that bandwidth, it
releases the packet channels, making them available for other
mobiles. A GPRS mobile reaches a peak data throughput of 120Kbps
while a circuit-switched GSM mobile has a maximum throughput of
14.4Kbps for a data connection.</p><p>Nortel Networks is committed to providing integrated voice
and data solutions with the highest level of quality. As we
introduce new technologies such as GPRS, the challenges for a GPRS
developer begin. How does a developer verify that the interface to
the protocol layer he just completed works correctly? How does the
developer complete an end-to-end call when there are no mobiles yet
in existence that use the protocol? The authors of this article
develop test systems that allow the GSM GPRS developers to verify
that our GPRS products are performing at a high level of quality
and dependability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16bb528"></a>GPRS</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3724f2.large.jpg"><img src="3724f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Simple GPRS Network System
Architecture</p></div></div>
</p><p>A GPRS system consists of several network nodes including
mobiles, base station system, serving GPRS service node (SGSN) and
gateway GPRS service node (GGSN). These nodes are shown in Figure
2. When the mobile activates an Internet protocol (IP) packet data
session, the base station notifies its SGSN. The SGSN activates the
session, called a packet data protocol (PDP) context, with the
GGSN. If necessary, the GGSN assigns a dynamic IP address to the
mobile's context. When the GGSN acknowledges successful context
creation, an IP tunnel using the GPRS tunneling protocol (GTP) is
created between the SGSN and GGSN. The tunnel ID (TID) is tied to
that mobile's context at both the GGSN and the SGSN.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3724f3.large.jpg"><img src="3724f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. GPRS Transmission Plane</p></div></div>
</p><p>Tracing mobile-originated IP packets through the GPRS nodes
(overlooking the RF access details) illuminates some of the testing
challenges. When the mobile sends IP data, the packets are
compressed and segmented by the subnetwork dependent convergence
protocol (SNDCP) and sent down through the logical link control
(LLC) layer traversing the stack shown in Figure 3. The mobile's
LLC layer ensures the packets arrive in sequence and resends any
packets not acknowledged by the SGSN. The LLC layer sends the
packets through the radio-specific portion of the RF stack, over
the RF link to the base station and the SGSN. At the SGSN, the peer
LLC layer acknowledges the received packets, and the SNDCP
compression and segmentation are undone.</p><p>As shown in Figure 3, the resulting IP packet is enveloped in
a GTP UDP/IP message with a header containing the mobile's context
TID. The SGSN sends the GTP packet to the GGSN's GTP port. The GGSN
extracts the IP packet and places it on the Gi interface. An
example of a Gi interface for IP is the Internet. For mobile-bound
packets, a similar procedure is repeated in the opposite
direction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16bbb58"></a>Automated Testing</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3724f4.large.jpg"><img src="3724f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. GAP System Architecture</p></div></div>
</p><p>Our typical approach to an automated test solution is to
place a test server at each interface to be tested, as illustrated
in Figure 4. The GSM developer then writes a test-case client using
a &ldquo;test services&rdquo; application program interface (API) to send and
receive messages via test servers. In response to these test-case
requests, a server performs actions to the system under test (SUT).
In message-based protocols, the server typically sends the
test-case's message to the SUT. When receiving a message from the
SUT, the server identifies the test-case client to which the
message belongs, and routes and forwards the message to the
test-case.</p><p>This testing paradigm was developed jointly by various groups
at Nortel Networks and was named the test tools framework (TTF).
Our automation team adopted the TTF paradigm and built the GSM
automation platform (GAP) on top. Although originally written for
HP-UX and VxWorks, TTF and GAP have been ported to Linux to allow
greater flexibility.</p><p>This system performs well when the automation group writes
the protocol stacks. However, the GPRS system requires the entire
IP stack, including the applications such as TELNET, FTP and HTTP.
We quickly realized that it would be impossible for us to generate
real TCP/IP traffic without rewriting the IP, UDP, TCP and
application stacks.</p><p>Linux's open and evolving IPv4 stack is very useful. When
testing a protocol, we are required to step outside of the
specification and test not only compliance, but error scenarios as
well. For example, if the path maximum transmission unit is set to
1499, we will need to send a packet with 1500 octets to see what
happens. Linux's open-source kernel and networking code makes this
possible.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3724f5.large.jpg"><img src="3724f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Mobile Application Data
Path</p></div></div>
</p><p>In the arrangement pictured in Figure 5, the test case
running on the Linux test-case machine brings up a tunnel using
GPRS signaling paths. Once the tunnel is established, the test-case
machine creates an IP alias for the test case's Mobile IP. The test
case machine is multi-homed on the user-space Gb LAN and the Gi
LAN. The test case uses IP applications or sockets to generate real
IP traffic through the Gb test server to the SGSN, through the Gn
test server, on to the Gi LAN, and possibly to the test-case
machine's Gi interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16b2ac8"></a>Testing the Gn Interface</h2></div></div><p>The first question to be answered was how to reuse the Linux
TCP/UDP/IP stacks. In our GPRS test system, the Gn test server
receives the GTP tunneled packets on a UDP socket, pulls the packet
out of the envelope and sends it out on another LAN (i.e., the
Internet). In the other direction, the Gn test server acts as a
gateway for the mobile receiving the packet from the Internet,
enveloping it into a tunnel packet and sending it to the SGSN's GTP
UDP port.</p><p>In the Linux system, the kernel transfers the packet from the
Gi LAN Ethernet card to an enveloping, outgoing UDP message. At
first, we brainstormed ways to use UDP sockets in kernel space;
however, we eventually decided upon a different approach.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3724f6.large.jpg"><img src="3724f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. USN Device and Routing
Configuration</p></div></div>
</p><p>Inspired by Alessandro Rubini's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device
Drivers</em></span> (see Resources 3), we sketched out a dual-device
driver. One side of the device driver would appear to be an
Ethernet card to the Linux kernel, while the other side would be a
character device as shown in Figure 6. Applications could read
packets sent out the Ethernet side of this device by reading from
the character-device side. Likewise, applications could send
packets into the Ethernet side of the device by writing to the
character file. We called this device the user-space network (USN)
device. Effectively, the USN device allows the kernel to send and
receive packets from any user-space application that opens the
USN's character device file.</p><p>The Linux machine on which the Gn test server resides acts as
a gateway for the mobile's IP subnet. The routing tables are
configured so that the mobile-bound IP packets are routed to the
USN device. When the kernel sends packets to this device, our
user-space daemon (<span   class="bold"><b>gtpd</b></span>) triggers
and reads the packets from the USN character-device file (e.g.,
/dev/usn0). Our daemon then places them in an enveloping GTP
message and sends the message to the SGSN's GTP port. Before
starting this development item, we spent a large amount of time
admiring our brilliance.</p><p>However, as our driver development continued into what we
thought was unknown territory, we began to notice Alan Cox's
footprints when we discovered the 2.0 kernel's netlink device (see
Resources 4). The netlink device is exactly half of our device
driver. It provides a character device and shell for dealing with
<b  >sk_buff</b> structures. At this point, all we had to
do was write the Ethernet device half of our driver. While joking
that half our job was already done, we were wondering how truly
original our idea was.</p><p>Around the time we finished the device driver, we obtained
the Linux 2.2 kernel. We loaded it onto one of our development
machines and discovered Alan Cox's ethertap device. The ethertap
device is exactly our USN device. It has interesting potentials for
tunneling and packet manipulation. Does your router allow only HTTP
packets through? The ethertap device could be used to route Quake
packets through your user-space application that envelopes them
into benign-looking HTTP packets.</p><p>Due to the time it would take to certify TTF and GAP on a new
kernel and, maybe, to prop up our diminished egos, we decided to
stay with our USN device rather than move to the Linux 2.2 kernel
and the ethertap device.</p><p>At this point, the work on the Gn test server was progressing
nicely and we began to focus on the other pieces of the
puzzle.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16b3150"></a>Testing the Gb Interface</h2></div></div><p>Data transportation in the world of mobility is often
treacherous. The Gb protocol stack (see Figure 3) is designed to
support reliable data transportation for multiple network
addressing schemes (e.g., IP or X.25), serving innumerable
applications in the packet data network.</p><p>Another large piece of the puzzle was the development of a
test server and test services to test the Gb protocol stack. This
development began about halfway through the development of the GGSN
test server. Naturally, Linux was our primary development
environment, and we planned on reusing the USN device and the Linux
UDP/TCP/IP stacks all over again. However, this time they would be
used to test the Gb stack by simulating calls via virtual mobiles,
cells and base stations.</p><p>The server portion of the Gb test interface is a distributed
application consisting of two primary components. One component
resides on a PowerPC single board computer (SBC) housed in a VME
chassis running a commercial RTOS. This component drives a
frame-relay interface running on PCI (peripheral component
interconnect) Mezzanine cards that support multiple T1 or E1
carriers. The second component performs resource management,
proxies the frame-relay services and implements the BSSGP (base
station system GPRS protocol) and NS (network service) layers of
the Gb protocol stack. Thanks to the diversity of TTF, this
component runs on either a PC running Linux 2.0 or a PowerPC SBC
target running an RTOS.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3724f7.large.jpg"><img src="3724f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Gb Test System</p></div></div>
</p><p>Within the test case as shown in Figure 7, the developer
creates instances of mobiles, cells and base stations using Gb test
services, all of which act as clients to the Gb test server. These
test services complete the Gb stack by implementing the LLC, SNDCP
and GMM (GPRS mobility management) Gb protocol layers per virtual
mobile.</p><p>Reserving mobiles, cells and base stations, the developer can
bring up simulated calls within their test case. Once the calls are
up and the PDP contexts are established, the developer uses basic
UDP or TCP sockets to send and receive data. The data is
encapsulated by the Linux UDP/TCP/IP stack and is routed to the USN
device. From there, test services retrieves the data from the USN
device, passes it through the Gb SNDCP, the LLC layers of the
virtual mobile, and then the Gb test server. At the server, the
data is passed through the BSSGP and NS protocol layers and then
transported over frame relay to the SGSN. This process is reversed
in the receive direction.</p><p>All of this was very nifty, but a larger problem loomed on
the horizon. What if we wanted to do something &ldquo;normal&rdquo;? Perhaps
something that could stress the SUT. What about bringing up several
simulated calls and using Netscape over them to browse the
Internet? That would mean binding an application's execution
environment to a specific PDP context.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16b3620"></a>Kernel Modifications</h2></div></div><p>The test-case machine sits on both the user-space internal Gb
LAN and the Gi LAN. In an example where the test case has two
mobiles, each with an active context, several routing problems
become immediately apparent. In this case, the user might want to
launch two instances of Netscape, &ldquo;binding&rdquo; each instance to a
different mobile's context (i.e., IP address). If one of these
Netscape sessions opens a TCP socket to a Gi LAN web server, the
kernel has three choices for routing the TCP packets: the kernel
could send the packets to either one of the two mobile's USN
devices, or to the Gi LAN's real Ethernet device.</p><p>For UDP or TCP sockets opened by the test-case developer, the
developer can use the <b  >SO_BINDTODEVICE</b> option by
calling <span   class="bold"><b>setsockopt</b></span>. Binding to a
specific device forces all packets sent on that socket to use the
bound device; however, applications such as FTP, TELNET and
Netscape do not use this option.</p><p>After careful observation of a Linux Virtual Private Network
software package, we noticed programs such as TELNET and Netscape
routed all their IP traffic out the VPN tunnel. Using
<span   class="bold"><b>nm</b></span> on the provided shared library,
we found that the shared library contained a complete replacement
for the socket API calls.</p><p>As web browsing is the major motivator for mobile data
services, we had to provide a way to surf the Web through a
mobile's context. After many hours looking through the Linux
networking code to forego rewriting the entire socket API, we
decided to hook into the IPv4 socket creation. Our hook searches
the current task's environment table for an environment variable
(<b  >ND</b>), and if it exists, binds it to the device
specified by the <b  >ND</b> variable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16b39e8"></a>Hooking In</h2></div></div><p>We wanted to do the hook as a loadable module. However, we
found we had to modify the Linux 2.0.36 networking code. We
modified the kernel to export the <b  >inet_proto_ops</b>
structure globally and tweaked the
<span   class="bold"><b>sock_register</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sock_unregister</b></span> routines to turn
interrupts on and off correctly. The Linux 2.2 kernel appears to
have made both these changes unnecessary and opens opportunities
for loadable-module &ldquo;over-binding&rdquo; of the native IP stack
operations.</p><p>When our module loads, we hook the socket creation process by
calling sock_register with the <b  >inet_proto_ops</b>
structure's create function pointer pointing to our socket
<span   class="bold"><b>create</b></span> function. From this point,
whenever a socket is created, our routine is called.</p><p>While we were in the kernel, we applied kernel patches to
provide a serial console and microsecond resolution time-stamping
for received Ethernet packets. We also modified the netlink driver
to increase its number of minor devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16b3d58"></a>Searching the Environment</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned before, when the hook is in place, our socket
creation function searches the current task's environment table for
the <b  >ND</b> variable, and if found, binds the socket
to that device.</p><p>The function first finds the environment table in physical
memory (in which the kernel runs), but the environment table memory
location is stored as user memory addresses under the task
structure
(current<b  >--&gt;</b><b  >mm--&gt;</b><b  >env_start</b>
to
current<b  >--&gt;</b>mm<b  >--&gt;</b>env_end).
We use <span   class="bold"><b>get_phys_addr</b></span> from
fs/proc/array.c to convert from the user address to the physical
address. Using this address translation function, our code searches
the current task's environment for <b  >ND=</b>.</p><p>If the <b  >ND</b> variable is found, our code
calls <span   class="bold"><b>sock_setsockopt</b></span> with the
SO_BINDTODEVICE option and the specified device. However,
sock_setsockopt copies the <b  >ifreq</b> structure from
user space to kernel space. Since our code lives in kernel space,
we had to implement the device bind by setting
<b  >sk-&gt;bound_device</b> ourselves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x16b4330"></a>Test Case Execution Environment</h2></div></div><p>Once we had the /dev entries for the USN device and the
SO_BINDTODEVICE mechanism compiled into the kernel, we were ready
to begin testing our concept. The initial test was very
straightforward; we used <span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span>
to configure a USN device and then set the new kernel-supported
<b  >ND</b> environment variable to that device. From
that point, any application we ran in that environment had its
outbound IP packets sent into our USN device. To actually watch the
packets, we executed <b  >tcpdump -i</b> on our USN
device (in this case, usn0).</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span> program was the
simplest way we knew how to start sending IP traffic, so we
executed it first. Everything proved to work the way we envisioned.
The ping packets began showing under
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpdump</b></span>. There was no one reading
the device file at the time, so no response was made to the ICMP
requests. But for our purposes, everything worked as
planned.</p><p>We then tried <span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>, another pair of IP
applications that generate IP traffic. We saw the ftp and telnet
traffic appear on our USN device, and that was sufficient proof to
us that our idea was sound&mdash;until we decided to open an
xterm.</p><p>Naturally, as for any X application, to see the xterm we had
to set the <b  >DISPLAY</b> environment variable to the
host name of our desktop machine. Setting the display is simple,
but when we tried to launch the xterm, we didn't quite expect what
happened next&mdash;nothing.</p><p>Unfortunately, our kernel modifications and USN device worked
a bit too well. After launching the xterm, a glance at the tcpdump
output made it apparent what was happening: all of our packets,
including the X packets, were being rerouted to the USN device.
While that had been a very good thing for ping, FTP and TELNET, it
was now a very bad thing. X packets were being written to the USN
device, never reaching the X server on the host machine.</p><p>We were, to say the least, disheartened. We had several
options at that point. The first idea was to note the transport
protocol in use (TCP) and the X port number as packets flowed
through the kernel, and route those packets through the Ethernet
device. This idea was quickly dismissed due to its complexity and
lack of elegance.</p><p>The second solution was to create a virtual X-user
environment the tester could open, as opposed to using telnet or
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> to access the test-case
machine. This concept was fostered by our recent introduction to
some of the interesting possibilities the VNC (virtual network
computing) software package created. VNC's abilities are
impressive, due to the fact that it is multiplatform.
Unfortunately, the VNC approach proved to be too slow.</p><p>The concept was sound, and ironically, preferable to having
the tester telnet in, export his display, etc. For all intents and
purposes, we could have testers log in from Windows PCs and open
VNC sessions to the Linux boxes. However, since the test community
was based in X running on HP-UX, why couldn't we turn to an X
server that allowed nesting?</p><p>The Xnest X server is both an X client and an X server. It is
a client to the X server on the host display (in our case, the HP),
and it is a server to X applications you execute on the remote
machine (the Linux box). The procedure to getting an Xnest session
up and running is quite simple. First, you log in to the remote
machine, export your display back to the host display, then run
Xnest with a local display string. This display string is then used
to run remote applications in the Xnest session.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c2580.0x19c6ce0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Using our USN device, the <b  >ND</b> environment
variable and our Xnest-user environment, we provide Nortel
Networks' GPRS developer with a desktop testing environment where
they can exercise the latest GPRS nodes simulating mobile web
surfers and the Internet.</p><p>Linux's open network code made all our work possible. Using
Alessandro Rubini's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> (see
Resources 3) and the Linux source code as a guide, we developed a
device driver in a very short amount of time, even though we had
never before written a device driver. Rubini's book also helped us
during our kernel modifications. It is hard to imagine being able
to do something this complex in such a short period of time with a
closed-source OS.</p><p>It is interesting to compare different versions of the Linux
kernels. The kernel's networking code is becoming more modular and
incorporates IPv6. With the latest kernel versions, all our device
driver and kernel modifications would have been unnecessary. In
addition to books such as Rubini's and being open source, Linux is
a capable choice for any networking application because of the
standards it supports and the constant improvements the Linux
development community provides.</p><p><a href="3724s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>

          irrational distrust of all computers, Wes did possess enough good
          sense to marry a goddess and now has a wonderful daughter godette
          filling his life.
