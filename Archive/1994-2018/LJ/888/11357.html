Open Atrium provides organizations and individuals
with a free, robust and flexible project management tool&mdash;one that
demonstrates just how powerful and beautiful Drupal can be.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbda250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Open Atrium is packed full of
features right out of the box: a calendar, discussions, a notebook for project
documentation and a flexible task manager. Even with hundreds of thousands of
Open Atrium installs, it's most powerful feature is often never taken
advantage of: Open Atrium is an open-source project.
</p><p>
Although people know what open source means, they don't take advantage of this
feature enough, even though it is one of the best features any project could
have. This feature empowers you to do so much more, but it doesn't mean
that you need to be a hard-core developer to participate. 
</p><p>
Let's explore some very real examples of the benefits of Open Atrium's open-source
feature and look at how you can take advantage of this
underutilized facet to make Open Atrium your own.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbda4b8"></a>
Set Yourself Apart</h2></div></div><p>
You probably wouldn't install Drupal for your business Web site and leave
the default theme. Why would you do that with Open Atrium? Although Open
Atrium's Ginkgo theme is a very usable theme, why not let your design and
style shine through to your staff, customers and vendors by customizing the
look and feel of Open Atrium with your own sub-theme?
</p><p>
One powerful aspect of Drupal's theme system is its ability to use
sub-themes. Sub-themes allow you to use an existing theme as a jumping point,
saving a significant amount of time, while still letting you apply your own
design.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbda670"></a>
Crystal&mdash;a Sub-theme for Open Atrium</h2></div></div><p>
A good example of a sub-theme for Open Atrium is the Crystal sub-theme by
Daniel O'Prey. Building off a previous sub-theme, Daniel created
Crystal to be a clean app-like theme. Although it could be used on its
own, let's use it here as a starting point for a new theme.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbda778"></a>
Installing a Sub-theme</h2></div></div><p>
Start by
making a copy and renaming Crystal's theme folder into /sites/all/themes.
For this example, name the sub-theme Baara, so its folder will be
/sites/all/themes/baara. (If you want to use Crystal as is, there's no
need to rename anything.)
</p><p>
Like any Drupal theme, this new sub-theme Baara will need a .info file
that
will define the name of the theme, a description, any CSS style files and
regions or DesignKit options. You simply can rename crystal.info to
baara.info,
and using your favorite text editor, make changes as needed. 
</p><p>
When finished, your .info file should look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
name = "Baara"
description = "A Ginkgo sub-theme to get work done, 
 &#8618;based on Crystal for Open Atrium."
core = "6.x"
atrium = "1.x"
engine = "phptemplate"
base theme = "ginkgo"

stylesheets[screen][] = "style.css"

regions[left] = "Left sidebar"
regions[right] = "Right sidebar"
regions[content] = "Content"
regions[header] = "Header"
regions[space_tools] = "Space tools"
regions[page_tools] = "Page tools"
regions[palette] = "Palette"

features[] = ""

; Designkit
designkit[color][background][title] = "Background"
designkit[color][background][description] = "Color for 
 &#8618;headers, other fills."
designkit[color][background][default] = "#44aa55"
designkit[image][logo][title] = "Logo"
designkit[image][logo][description] = "Header logo."
designkit[image][logo][imagecache] = "imagecache_scale:300x40"
</pre>
</p><p>
The first six lines set the name and description of the new sub-theme, the
version requirements for Drupal, and most important, it lets Open Atrium
know that it's a compatible theme and defines the parent theme for the
sub-theme (in this case, Ginkgo).
</p><p>
Sub-themes function just like normal Drupal themes. They can include images,
stylesheets and templates. Stylesheets can be reused from the parent theme,
or in this example case, be overridden by declaring them in the .info file, as seen on the
line <tt  >stylesheets[screen][] = "style.css"</tt>, which will override the style.css
file found in Ginkgo.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;regions&rdquo; entries list all regions available in your sub-theme. If
you modify any of the template files to add new regions, you'll need to be
sure to modify this list. It's important to note that while adding
regions can be done easily, removing or renaming regions should be done with
care and may cause complications, as many Open Atrium Features are built to
expect those default regions.
</p><p>
If you plan on having additional customization that could be managed through
the Drupal admin pages, the &ldquo;designkit&rdquo; entries allow you to specify
the customizations you want to make available on
/admin/build/themes/settings/baara. To learn more about DesignKit and how to
use it, see the README.txt, which comes with the DesignKit module
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/designkit" target="_self">drupal.org/project/designkit</a>).
</p><p>
For additional information on Drupal theming and details on available options
to use in the baara.info file, read the on-line Drupal Theming Guide (<a href="http://drupal.org/documentation/theme" target="_self">drupal.org/documentation/theme</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbdad50"></a>
Ginkgo Sprite Overrides</h2></div></div><p>
With the new sub-theme folder created and .info file completed, you can turn
your attention to applying style and design. Ginkgo's extensive use of
sprites throughout its design allows you to make some pretty radical changes
simply by modifying or replacing these images. 
</p><p>
Ginkgo uses these sprites as background images to many of the elements
throughout the site as defined in the style.css stylesheet. There are three
main sprite images (along with RTL for right-to-left languages), which you will
find in the Ginkgo images directory:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
sprite_base.png &mdash; base UI elements, such as priority indicators and default
user avatar placeholder images.
</p></li><li><p>
sprite_icons.png &mdash; Atrium Feature's icons used in menus.
</p></li><li><p>
sprite_skin.png &mdash; gradients and other backgrounds, along with the default
logo.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To override these images in your sub-theme, re-declare them in your
style.css and include the modified sprite images in your Baara theme's
images folder. If you want to replace the default icons, you can modify the
sprite_icons.png by inserting the custom icons. More-advanced sub-themes may
take advantage of additional sprites, which you can include in your
sub-theme's image folder.
</p><p>
Be sure to maintain the same metrics and coordinates of
these sprite files from the originals; third-party Open Atrium features are
built with this expectation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbdb220"></a>
A Style of Your Own</h2></div></div><p>
In the example .info file, you made the declaration
<tt  >stylesheets[screen][] = "style.css"</tt>,
which overrides the Ginkgo theme's style.css stylesheet. This not only
allows you to override Ginkgo's sprite images, but also will house any
other CSS style changes you need.
</p><p>
Be careful when overriding any of Ginkgo's design, as
changes to templates and layouts may make it difficult to take advantage of
community-contributed features.
</p><p>

<a href="http://community.openatrium.com/shopresources/feature-directory" target="_self">community.openatrium.com/shopresources/feature-directory</a> for a listing
of sub-themes created by other Open Atrium community members.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbdb488"></a>
When Something Is Not Quite Right</h2></div></div><p>
Now that Open Atrium is looking more like your organization, let's consider
the actual features of Open Atrium. Like a great many things
in life, one size does not always fit all, and each organization that uses
Open Atrium often has unique needs and requirements that require changes to
the default settings included in Open Atrium.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbdb590"></a>
Overriding Settings</h2></div></div><p>
There are three ways to override the settings in Open Atrium: simply make the
changes in the Drupal configuration interface, fork the Atrium Feature you
want to modify, or create the much more flexible custom feature override
module.
</p><p>
The first option&mdash;making changes directly through the configuration
pages&mdash;is
immediate. It can be done by almost anyone with access, and it requires no
programming. Although this sounds great, note that this technique comes with a
great deal of risk&mdash;it's immediate, ready or not. Once you make that
change, it's live. There is no chance to coordinate other related
changes. In addition, all users with access can make a change, even if they
didn't mean to make the change. It doesn't require programming, which
means it's not in code. This could lead to a couple major issues. First,
it's difficult to deploy to a production server. Someone has to write down
every configuration change that was made, and then on production, walk back through
each change. Second, there's no way to know what state the site is in, so
did those changes get made? There's only one way to check&mdash;load each configuration
page and look.
</p><p>
It's also important to note that if you change a setting through the
configuration interface that belongs to a feature module, you may have trouble
with future upgrades. When upgrading, you sometimes are required to
&ldquo;revert&rdquo; the Feature module. This allows the Feature module to make
any new changes to its configuration to support the upgrade. When this
happens, any setting changes that you made through the configuration interface
will be lost.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbdb7a0"></a>
Custom Override Module</h2></div></div><p>
By far, the best way to manage setting overrides in Open Atrium is by making
use of a custom override module. This is a simple module that houses a
collection of Drupal module hooks and alters that capture the settings into
code. This protects your changes from being lost during upgrades and
provides
these additional benefits:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Version control: make rollbacks more granular instead of rolling back the
entire database.
</p></li><li><p>
Features can be turned on and off per group. Un-featured configurations are
global in scope.
</p></li><li><p>
Easily see what has changed from one version of a feature to another using
diff tools.
</p></li><li><p>
Use features on other sites, saving countless hours of filling out forms and
clicking.
</p></li><li><p>
Features can be shared on feature servers, so you can share your work with the
world (or a smaller team).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Creating a custom override module does require a basic understanding of the
building blocks of Drupal and Open Atrium, and it requires that you are comfortable
with code.

Something's Missing</h2></div></div><p>
You may find that special tools are required for your organization, and
although
Open Atrium contains a powerful feature set, there's a chance that
you'll need something different. 
</p><p>
In some cases, you may find that the Open Atrium community already has created
the tool you're looking for. For example, a popular tool that often
is added to an Open Atrium install is Atrium Folders created by Nuvole. Atrium
Folders provides a simple file repository feature. To install this feature,
or any other feature or module created by the community, simply download,
extract, copy to your /sites/all/modules/contrib folder and enable.
</p><p>
If your needs are even more unique, you can create your own feature or module
as a solution. Being built on top of Drupal, Open Atrium includes a wide
selection of building blocks contributed by the community, and it often provides
an excellent starting point for creating a completely custom feature for your
site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbd39f8"></a>
The Next Step</h2></div></div><p>
So, you've installed Open Atrium, created a theme, customized Atrium
features, added additional features or maybe even built your own. Where do you
go from here? 
</p><p>
The next step is to get involved directly with the Open Atrium project.
</p><p>
Open source not only means you have the freedom to customize and extend, but
also the freedom to participate, and right now is a great time to start.
Planning is underway to plot the path and direction Open Atrium will take
as it's upgraded to 2.x.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbd3bb0"></a>
Open Atrium 2.0 Roadmap</h2></div></div><p>
We've identified few key areas that we feel should be the focus for Open
Atrium 2.0:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
User interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Improved feature set.
</p></li><li><p>
Third-party integration.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Open Atrium's current Ginkgo theme is a vibrant breath of fresh
air in the arena of Drupal themes. However, there is room for improvement with
its user experience. We are looking to bring a new dynamic theme to Open
Atrium 2.x that takes advantage of best practices and technology to provide a
world-class user experience, one that fully supports today's mobile
devices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbd3f78"></a>
Improved Feature Set</h2></div></div><p>
Open Atrium 2.0 also will be improving existing features and adding new
features that support the project management workflow. We plan to extend
features, such as the Calendar/Task/To-Do feature and
Notebook, while also improving their functionality. In addition, we plan to
add useful features like Files and Timekeeping.
</p><p>
Additionally, Open Atrium's focus on project management calls for a shift
from a generic &ldquo;groups&rdquo; concept to specialized projects. This, coupled
with a new ability to assign users to organizations and set privileges around
these organizations, could provide users with an intuitive way of managing
their projects and team members.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbd4130"></a>
Third-Party Integration</h2></div></div><p>
We know a lot of great tools exist that people rely on to get
their jobs done. We should work toward building Open Atrium 2.0 with that in
mind. Some areas we should look into are calendar, timekeeping and
ticketing integration. Of course, a lot of solutions exist, so
we're really going to need the community to identify and help build
connections to those services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xae2580.0xbd4238"></a>
Implementation and Community Participation</h2></div></div><p>
The community is an essential part of any open-source project, and Open Atrium
is no exception. Many of these ideas for improvement have come directly from
requests through e-mail, Twitter and <a href="https://community.openatrium.com" target="_self">https://community.openatrium.com</a>.
</p><p>
Participation doesn't mean only coding; we want to hear your
thoughts and ideas on this plan. However, like all open-source projects, we
need developers and designers to help start building the next generation of
Open Atrium. This release will not be possible without your coding
contributions, testing efforts, documentation assistance and feedback. We
are very excited about this next phase of Open Atrium and are excited to work
with the community to make it happen!

Patrick Settle, Drupal developer, digs into his bag of tricks whenever
he runs across a &ldquo;new&rdquo; challenge facing Open Atrium, which he's
been developing since its beginnings. Thanks to 12 years in system
administration for companies from SAIC to the WorldWatch Institute and
eight years building Drupal, he's uniquely able to balance a versatility
in infrastructure planning with a specialized knowledge of application
development that benefits end users and administrators alike.
