Create your own customized distribution to speed up your Drupal development
process.

Do you find yourself repeating the same steps whenever you start a new
Drupal project? Do you always download and enable the same modules,
and make the same configuration changes every time? As we start
doing more and more Drupal projects at Nomensa, I noticed that we
were doing exactly this, so I started to look into ways to streamline
our initial project setup process. My solution was to create my own
custom installation profile that provides me with a template to start
each project, and this article outlines the steps I took to create
it. The code outlined in this article has been committed into GitHub
at <a href="https://github.com/opdavies/linuxjournal_demo" target="_self">https://github.com/opdavies/linuxjournal_demo</a>, and it's available for
you to download and re-use as needed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184f408"></a>
What Are Installation Profiles?</h2></div></div><p>
Installation profiles are a combination of modules and themes and
predefined configuration. A great example of an installation
profile that I use regularly is called Commerce Kickstart
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart" target="_self">drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart</a>). It provides a version of
Drupal 7 along with the Drupal Commerce suite of modules that have been
preconfigured to have the correct content types, rules, views and so on. Once
an installation profile has been uploaded onto drupal.org as a project,
it gets bundled with Drupal core, is available as a packaged download,
and is known as a distribution. 
See <a href="http://drupal.org/project/distributions" target="_self">drupal.org/project/distributions</a> for a list of
existing distributions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11341f1.large.jpg"><img src="11341f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

How to Install an Existing Installation Profile</h2></div></div><p>
There are two different ways to download an existing Drupal
installation profile. The first (and easiest) method is to download it
as a distribution from drupal.org. To do this, go to the project page
for the installation profile (for example,
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart" target="_self">drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart</a>), scroll to the bottom of
the page, and download a release in the same way that you would
download a module or theme. The resulting file will be named something
like commerce_kickstart-7.x-1.10-core.tar.gz, and this file will contain
both
Drupal core and the Commerce Kickstart installation profile. The other
option is to download a fresh copy of Drupal core, and then
download the installation profile seperately, either using a drush
command like <tt  >drush dl commerce_kickstart</tt>, or clone it directly from
its Git repository, and then place it within the Drupal's profiles
directory.
</p><p>
Now, when you go to install Drupal, there is an additional option to
use the Commerce Kickstart installation profile. Select the
appropriate profile, click the Save and continue button, and continue
through the installation process as normal.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x184fb98"></a>
How to Start Creating Your Own Installation Profile</h2></div></div><p>
Outside your Drupal directory, create a new directory to
hold the files for your installation profile. Mine is called
linuxjournal_profile, although the name of the profile is going to
be simply linuxjournal. I've appended _profile to the end of the
directory name. Later, there will be several different directories with
similar names, so this helps provide some clarity. Be sure to give some
thought to the name beforehand and ensure that it doesn't conflict with
any potential modules or themes.
</p><p>
The first file I need to create is the linuxjournal.info file that,
identical to .info files for modules and themes, defines the name and
description of the profile, as well as which version of Drupal core that
it is compatible with. I'm also going to make it dependent on the core
dblog and block modules so that these are enabled automatically when
the profile is installed:


<pre     class="programlisting">
name = Linux Journal
description = A demonstration installation profile for my LJ article.
core = 7.x
dependencies[] = dblog
dependencies[] = block
</pre>
</p><p>
The only other mandatory file needed for this profile to be visible to
Drupal is the .profile file&mdash;in this case, linuxjournal.profile. Within
this file, I can put any custom PHP functions or implementations of Drupal
hooks that will take effect during the installation process. For now,
I'm just going to add an opening PHP tag and leave the rest of the
file blank. To confirm that everything works okay so far, I can download a
fresh copy of Drupal core, copy linuxjournal_profile into the profiles
directory, rename it to linuxjournal so that it is the same as the
name of the profile, and load that site in a Web browser.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11341f3.large.jpg"><img src="11341f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Install Screen with the Linux Journal Installation Profile
</p></div></div><p>
So far, so good. On the installation page, as well as seeing the default
Standard and Minimal profiles, I also can see my Linux Journal
profile. I can select this and continue with the installation process
as normal to confirm that it's working, although because I've not entered
anything into linuxjournal.profile yet, nothing special is going to
happen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1850010"></a>
Adding a .install File</h2></div></div><p>
Identical to writing a module, I can create a .install file that
contains functions to run when the profile is installed, updated or
uninstalled. I'm going to utilize the hook_install() function from the
minimal installation profile as part of my profile instead of re-declaring
its contents myself and duplicating code. Within my own implementation of
hook_install(), I can include the .install file from the minimal profile
and then run its minimal_install() function:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php

/**
 * @file
 * Install, update and uninstall functions
 * for the Linux Journal installation profile.
 */

/**
 * Implements hook_install().
 *
 * Run the hook_install() function from the minimal
 * profile as part of this profile.
 */
function linuxjournal_install() {
  // Utilize the hook_install() implementation from 
  // the minimal profile.
  include_once DRUPAL_ROOT . '/profiles/minimal/minimal.install';
  minimal_install();
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x18501c8"></a>
Adding Modules</h2></div></div><p>
I'm now going to create another file called linuxjournal.make. This
file contains a listing of all the projects (modules and themes)
and libraries that are used within the profile. My company specializes in
building accessible Web sites, and I use a number of contributed modules on
every site to help me do this.
There are also some essential contributed modules, such as
Administration Menu (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/admin_menu" target="_self">drupal.org/project/admin_menu</a>) and Pathauto
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/pathauto" target="_self">drupal.org/project/pathauto</a>), as well as some custom modules and
features that I use on every site. All of these will be listed within
the linuxjournal.make file.
</p><p>
At the very top of linuxjournal.make, I need to add the following two
lines to define the API version as well as the version of Drupal core
that I'm using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
api = 2
core = 7.x
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is the syntax for adding a project&mdash;in this case, the Administration
Menu module&mdash;into a profile. Personally, I like to download projects
from their Git repositories, although they could just be downloaded from
drupal.org using wget. It's worth noting that the download URL doesn't
have to be a URL at drupal.org. You can download projects from other
sources, such as GitHub or BitBucket, or any other source, including from
local file directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
projects[admin_menu][type] = module
projects[admin_menu][subdir] = contrib
projects[admin_menu][version] = 3.0-rc3
projects[admin_menu][download][type] = git
projects[admin_menu][download][url] = 
 &#8618;http://git.drupal.org/project/admin_menu.git
projects[admin_menu][download][branch] = 7.x-3.x
</pre>
</p><p>
All modules specified will be located in the profiles/linuxjournal/modules
directory by default; however, I prefer to store contributed modules
in a subdirectory called contrib, hence the subdir value. I've also
specified which version of the module to use and which branch within
the Git repository to use. If I didn't specify a version number,
the latest commit to the specified branch would be used.
</p><p>
To make the Administration Menu module enabled by default after installing
the profile, I can declare it as a dependency by adding the following
line into linuxjournal.info in the same way that I did for the dblog and
block modules earlier:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dependencies[] = admin_menu
</pre>
</p><p>
If I update my version of Drupal with these changes and try following the
installation process, I will get an error because I've made the profile
dependent on the Administration Menu module, but this module hasn't been
downloaded yet for this instance of Drupal. The next step is to create
a distribution that contains the linuxjournal installation profile,
as well as all of the projects that are defined in linuxjournal.make.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11341f4.large.jpg"><img src="11341f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x18507f8"></a>
Creating a Distribution</h2></div></div><p>
To create a distribution, the first thing I need to do is make a new file
called distro.make that will be used to compile an instance of
Drupal that contains the linuxjournal profile. As with linuxjournal.make,
I need to start with declaring the API version and the version of Drupal
core. I also need to declare Drupal core as a project as well as include
the linuxjournal profile:


<pre     class="programlisting">
api = 2
core = 7.x

projects[drupal][type] = core
projects[drupal][version] = "7"

; Add the Linux Journal profile to the full distribution build.
projects[linuxjournal][type] = profile
projects[linuxjournal][download][type] = git
projects[linuxjournal][download][url] = 
 &#8618;https://github.com/opdavies/linuxjournal_demo.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, I'm using Git to download the installation profile and providing
the distribution with the URL to the repository at GitHub. With
distro.make saved, I now can compile Drupal using the following Drush
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
drush make distro.make directory
</pre>
</p><p>
The last parameter is the name of the directory that you want Drupal to be
compiled into. If one isn't specified, the directory that you're currently
in will be used, which I wouldn't recommend. I want the resulting
directory to be placed in the same level as my linuxjournal_profile
directory, so I need to move up one level before specifying the name of
the directory, which is going to be linuxjournal_demo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
drush make distro.make ../linuxjournal_demo
</pre>
</p><p>
This command will download the latest version of Drupal 7 core, as
well as all projects defined within linuxjournal.profile, into the
linuxjournal_demo directory. Once that's compiled everything, within
the profiles/linuxjournal directory, there is a new directory called
modules/contrib that contains the admin_menu module. With all of the
dependencies downloaded, I now can go to install.php again and go
through the installation process without any errors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1850b68"></a>
Adding Themes into an Installation Profile</h2></div></div><p>
I can add a theme into my profile by declaring it within linuxjournal.make
in the same way that I can for modules. As I use Omega as a base theme
for most of my themes, I'll include that within my profile so that it's
downloaded automatically:


<pre     class="programlisting">
; Themes =========================================================
projects[omega][type] = theme
projects[omega][version] = 3.1
projects[omega][download][type] = git
projects[omega][download][url] = 
 &#8618;http://git.drupal.org/project/omega.git
projects[omega][download][branch] = 7.x-3.x
</pre>
</p><p>
For now, I'll be creating the sub-theme manually, so I won't change the default theme here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1847608"></a>
Customizing the Site Configuration Form</h2></div></div><p>
When going through the installation process, I usually make several changes
to the site configuration form&mdash;namely setting a
default site name and adding the default country. I can automate
these changes by adding an implementation of hook_form_FORM_ID_alter()
into linuxjournal.profile, as any functions defined in this file will
take effect during the installation process. I know that the ID of the
form is install_configure_form, and the name of the function that I'm
going to create will be linuxjournal_form_install_configure_form_alter():


<pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * Implements hook_form_alter().
 *
 * Allows the profile to alter the site configuration form.
 */
function linuxjournal_form_install_configure_form_alter(&amp;$form, 
 &#8618;$form_state) {
  // Set a default site name.
  $form['site_information']['site_name']['#default_value'] = 
 &#8618;t('Linux Journal Demo');
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As the form object is passed into the function by reference, I can add
or overwrite information within the object by using this function. Here
I'm setting a default value for the site's name field that will be
pre-populated on the site configuration form the next time I follow the
installation process. I can add and override any other values on the
form by adding them into this function:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * Implements hook_form_alter().
 *
 * Allows the profile to alter the site configuration form.
 */
function linuxjournal_form_install_configure_form_alter(&amp;$form, 
 &#8618;$form_state) {
  // Set a default site name and email address.
  $form['site_information']['site_name']['#default_value']
 &#8618;= t('Linux Journal Demo');
  $form['site_information']['site_mail']['#default_value'] 
 &#8618;= 'linuxjournal@oliverdavies.co.uk';

  // Set a default username and email address.
  $form['admin_account']['account']['name']['#default_value'] 
 &#8618;= 'Oliver Davies';
  $form['admin_account']['account']['mail']['#default_value'] 
 &#8618;= 'linuxjournal@oliverdavies.co.uk';

  // Set a default country and timezone.
  $form['server_settings']['site_default_country']['#default_value'] 
 &#8618;= 'GB';
  $form['server_settings']['date_default_timezone']['#default_value'] 
 &#8618;= 'Europe/London';

  // Disable the 'receive email notifications' check box.
  $form['update_notifications']['update_status_module']
&#8618;['#default_value'][1] = 0;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, as well as adding a default site name, I've also added a default site
e-mail address, a default user name and e-mail address for the first user
account, added a default time zone and country, and disabled the option
to receive e-mail alerts when new updates are available. For security
reasons, I don't want to define my password in this file and will
continue to enter this onto the form directly. I'm using
#default_value and not #value so I can edit these predefined
values on the form if I need to for this site. If I used #value, I
would not be able to do so.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11341f5.large.jpg"><img src="11341f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Setting the Administration Theme</h2></div></div><p>
Basically, what I now have is a copy of the minimal installation profile
with some additional modules and themes. The first thing I want to
do next is use the Seven theme for the administration pages of the site,
as it would be if I'd used the standard installation profile. To do this,
I first need to enable Seven and then set some variables to set it as the
administration theme. I can reference the .install file from the standard
installation profile to find out how to do this. To do so, I
add the following code into the linuxjournal_install() function in linuxjournal.install:

<pre     class="programlisting">
// Enable the administration theme.
$admin_theme = 'seven';
db_update('system')
  -&gt;fields(array('status' =&gt; 1))
  -&gt;condition('type', 'theme')
  -&gt;condition('name', $admin_theme)
  -&gt;execute();
variable_set('admin_theme', $admin_theme);
variable_set('node_admin_theme', '1');
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1847c90"></a>
Creating Content Types</h2></div></div><p>
The standard installation profile also creates two default content types:
basic pages and articles. I'm going to re-use most of this code to create
the basic page content type for my profile:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// Add a 'Basic page' content type.
$types = array(
  array(
    'type' =&gt; 'page',
    'name' =&gt; st('Basic page'),
    'base' =&gt; 'node_content',
    'description' =&gt; st("Use &lt;em&gt;basic pages&lt;/em&gt; for 
 &#8618;your static content, such as an 'About us' page."),
    'custom' =&gt; 1,
    'modified' =&gt; 1,
    'locked' =&gt; 0,
  );
);

foreach ($types as $type) {
  $type = node_type_set_defaults($type);
  node_type_save($type);
  node_add_body_field($type);
}

// Default 'Basic page' to not be promoted and don't 
// display author information.
variable_set('node_options_page', array('status'));
variable_set('node_submitted_page', FALSE);
</pre>
</p><p>
To create additional content types, I can keep adding new items into
the $types array, and they will be processed within the foreach() loop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1757580.0x1847ea0"></a>
Adding Text Formats and a WYSIWYG Editor</h2></div></div><p>
When you use the standard installation profile, several different text
formats are created. Currently, I have only plain text and PHP code
(because the PHP module is now also a dependency for my profile). I also
want the additional text formats, so I'll copy that section of code from
the standard.install file and paste in into the linuxjournal_install()
function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
// Add text formats.
$text_formats['filtered_html'] = array(
  'format' =&gt; 'filtered_html',
  'name' =&gt; 'Filtered HTML',
  'weight' =&gt; 0,
  'filters' =&gt; array(
    // URL filter.
    'filter_url' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 0,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
    // HTML filter.
    'filter_html' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 1,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
      // Line break filter.
    'filter_autop' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 2,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
    // HTML corrector filter.
    'filter_htmlcorrector' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 10,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
  ),
);
$text_formats['full_html'] = array(
  'format' =&gt; 'full_html',
  'name' =&gt; 'Full HTML',
  'weight' =&gt; 1,
  'filters' =&gt; array(
    // URL filter.
    'filter_url' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 0,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
      // Line break filter.
    'filter_autop' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 1,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
    // HTML corrector filter.
    'filter_htmlcorrector' =&gt; array(
      'weight' =&gt; 10,
      'status' =&gt; 1,
    ),
  ),
);
$text_formats['raw_html'] = array(
  'format' =&gt; 'raw_html',
  'name' =&gt; 'Raw HTML',
  'weight' =&gt; 2,
);
foreach ($text_formats as $text_format) {
  $text_format = (object) $text_format;
  filter_format_save($text_format);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
I've amended the format slightly by creating an array called
$text_formats, and then using a foreach loop to save each one as opposed
to doing them separately as it is done in standard.install. I also usually
create a Raw HTML format that allows all HTML tags and doesn't have
any filters applied to it, so I've added it here as an additional format
to be created automatically.

Adding TinyMCE and Enabling It for Certain Text Formats</h2></div></div><p>
I also download and install the WYSIWYG module and the TinyMCE editor for
each site. Rather than having to download and enable the WYSIWYG module,
download and extract the TinyMCE library and configure the editor, I
can add it into my profile to have it done automatically. First, I need
to add the WYSIWYG (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/wysiwyg" target="_self">drupal.org/project/wysiwyg</a>) and Libraries
API (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/libraries" target="_self">drupal.org/project/libraries</a>) modules and add them into
dependencies to have them enabled by default.
</p><p>
In linuxjournal.make:


<pre     class="programlisting">

TinyMCE will be downloaded and extracted into the
profiles/linuxjournal/profiles directory and will be accessible by the
WYSIWYG module once Libraries API is enabled. However, now that it has
been downloaded, I need to assign it to one of my text formats before
it can be used. The format I'm going to assign it to is Filtered
HTML, and I can do that by adding a record into the wysiwyg table in the
database. I've also added an array of default settings that I've used on
another site, and I've added this into the drupal_write_record() function:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// Add the TinyMCE editor to the Filtered HTML text format.
$tinymce_settings = array(
  'default' =&gt; 1,
  'user_choose' =&gt; 0,
  'show_toggle' =&gt; 0,
  'theme' =&gt; 'advanced',
  'language' =&gt; 'en',
  'buttons' =&gt; array(
    'default' =&gt; array(
      'bold' =&gt; 1,
      'italic' =&gt; 1,
      'strikethrough' =&gt; 1,
      'justifyleft' =&gt; 1,
      'justifycenter' =&gt; 1,
      'justifyright' =&gt; 1,
      'justifyfull' =&gt; 1,
      'bulllist' =&gt; 1,
      'numlist' =&gt; 1,
      'link' =&gt; 1,
      'unlink' =&gt; 1,
      'anchor' =&gt; 1,
      'image' =&gt; 1,
      'formatselect' =&gt; 1,
      'sup' =&gt; 1,
      'sub' =&gt; 1,
      'blockquote' =&gt; 1,
      'code' =&gt; 1,
      'hr' =&gt; 1,
      'removeformat' =&gt; 1,
      'charmap' =&gt; 1,
    ),
  ),
  'toolbar_loc' =&gt; 'top',
  'toolbar_align' =&gt; 'left',
  'path_loc' =&gt; 'bottom',
  'resizing' =&gt; 1,
  'verify_html' =&gt; 1,
  'preformatted' =&gt; 0,
  'convert_fonts_to_spans' =&gt; 1,
  'remove_linebreaks' =&gt; 1,
  'apply_source_formatting' =&gt; 0,
  'paste_auto_cleanup_on_paste' =&gt; 1,
  'block_formats' =&gt; 'p,address,pre,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,div',
  'css_setting' =&gt; 'theme',
  'css_path' =&gt; '',
  'css_classes' =&gt; '',
);

// Create the record.
$record = array(
  'format' =&gt; 'filtered_html',
  'editor' =&gt; 'tinymce',
  'settings' =&gt; $tinymce_settings,
);

// Save the record to the database.
drupal_write_record('wysiwyg', $record);
</pre>
</p><p>
It's worth noting here that the $tinymce_settings variable needs to be
a standard PHP array as it will be serialized automatically when it
is written into the database table. When I first tried this, I tried
importing a pre-serialized array into the database, which subsequently
generated errors when trying to view the WYSIWYG admin settings form.

Creating Additional User Roles and Assigning Permissions</h2></div></div><p>
All of the Drupal sites that we build at my company have a moderation
workflow in place provided by the Workbench Moderation module
(<a href="http://drupal.org/project/workbench_moderation" target="_self">drupal.org/project/workbench_moderation</a>). This requires creating
some additional roles for users who can edit and publish content. I also
usually create a Developer role for use by any of the other Developers in
the team that has permissions to all of the modules on the site, as well
as an Administrator role for users who need more administrative access
than Editors and Publishers, but who don't need full Developer-level
access. Again, I can reference a section of code from standard.install
and use that as a template:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// Create new user roles for Developers, Administrators, 
// Editors and Publishers.
$roles = array('Developer', 'Administrator', 'Editor', 'Publisher');
foreach ($roles as $weight =&gt; $name) {
  $role = new stdClass;
  $role-&gt;name = $name;
  $role-&gt;weight = $weight + 2, // New roles must have at 
                               // least a weight of 2.

  // Save the new role.
  user_role_save($role);

  if ($name == 'Developer') {
    // Give the Developer role all permissions.
    user_role_grant_permissions($role-&gt;rid, 
 &#8618;array_keys(module_invoke_all('permission')));

    // Set this as the administrator role.
    variable_set('user_admin_role', $role-&gt;rid);

    // Assign user 1 the Developer role.
    db_insert('users_roles')
      -&gt;fields(array('uid' =&gt; 1, 'rid' =&gt; $role-&gt;rid))
      -&gt;execute();
}
</pre>
</p><p>
I've created an array containing the names of the new roles I want
to create, and then a foreach() loop including the key of each item
that will be used to define the weight for each role. The first section
applies to all new roles where the role is created, and then there is an
additional section that applies only to the Developer role. This section
assigns all permissions to the Developer role as well as assigning the role
to user 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11341f6.large.jpg"><img src="11341f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Additional Roles
</p></div></div><p>
With the new roles created, I now can set some default permissions:


<pre     class="programlisting">
// Assign some default permissions.
$filtered_html_permission = 
 &#8618;filter_permission_name($filtered_html_format);
$raw_html_permission = filter_permission_name($raw_html_format);
user_role_grant_permissions(DRUPAL_ANONYMOUS_RID, 
 &#8618;array('access content', $filtered_html_permission));
user_role_grant_permissions(DRUPAL_AUTHENTICATED_RID, 
 &#8618;array('access content', 'access administration menu', 
 &#8618;'access devel information', $filtered_html_permission, 
 &#8618;$raw_html_permission));
</pre>
</p><p>
To start, I find out the name of the permissions for the Filtered
HTML and Raw HTML text formats that I created earlier. Anonymous users
are going to have very restricted permissions and are only going to
be able to access content and use the Filtered HTML permission. The
authenticated users also will be able to access the Administration Menu
and information from the Devel module, as well as the Filtered HTML and
Raw HTML text formats.
</p><p>
These are just a few examples of what can be done using installation
profiles and distributions, and I've shown some of the ways I automate
the Drupal installation and configuration processes. The complete
installation profile I'm currently using at Nomensa also includes
custom themes with theme template overrides that then can be used on
custom public-facing and administration themes and additional Drupal
configuration. This has saved me hours of time in the initial development
stages as opposed to having to redo the same steps each time I start
developing a new site.
