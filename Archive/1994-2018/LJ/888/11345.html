Want a crash course on how to write distributions for the
Drupal platform? Get tips and expert advice from a longtime Drupal
contributor and distribution developer. This article is packed with
examples of problems and solutions for writing plugins that integrate
cleanly with other distributions and make the best use of the Drupal
toolkit.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x2852250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
First off, what is a distribution and why would you write one?
Even more than many other content management system (CMS) frameworks,
Drupal is up for pretty much any task you set it. You can think of
Drupal like a potter's workshop. Want a vase or plate or mug or Halloween
mask? You can find different kinds of clay on the shelf and the potter's
wheel is right over there&mdash;go for it!
</p><p>
No problem&mdash;as long as you're a skilled potter. But, if it's your first
time spinning clay, your plate's likely to come out wonky or crack
when it hits the kiln.
</p><p>
What you want is a mold&mdash;something that'll give your plate just the
right thickness and structure and shape. From there, sure, you can add
your own details and dab on whatever glaze you like.
</p><p>
So if Drupal is like a potter's workshop, a distribution
is the plaster mold&mdash;something you can use quickly to make an expertly
designed product that fits a particular purpose.
</p><p>
There's a growing set of Drupal distributions available. Need to build
a Web site for a conference, newspaper, government agency, on-line
store or nonprofit organization? Rather than starting from scratch,
you'll get a huge leg up if you start with the Conference Organizing
Distribution (COD), OpenPublic, OpenPublish, Commerce Kickstart or
Open Outreach.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x28525c0"></a>
Why Write a Distribution?</h2></div></div><p>
Maybe the first question should be, &ldquo;what are some top reasons
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to write a distribution?&rdquo;
Fame and fortune, for one&mdash;writing and maintaining a distro is hard
work. It eventually may create some income in the form of contracts
to extend existing functionality, but in the short term, you've got a
ton of designing and coding to get through. As for fame, well, despite
their merits, most distributions are notably modest in terms of both
community profile and the number of actual installs.
</p><p>
Another good reason not to write a distribution is there already may be one
(or more) in existence that fits the bill. True, those existing distributions
may not do everything you want them to do exactly the way you would
have done it. But, rather than doing it your own way, try pitching in
and improving the existing projects. That's what open source is all about.
</p><p>
With the &ldquo;why nots&rdquo; out of the way, here are some key reasons to consider
writing a distribution:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You're working with or for a large institution or network that
will need many sites built along a common model.
</p></li><li><p>
You've got a sizable contract to build a Web site that fits
a need not already covered by an existing distribution; you expect to
be doing similar sites in the future, and you've got room in the
project to generalize.
</p></li><li><p>
You're tired of doing the same site-building work over and over
and want to focus on refinements.
</p></li><li><p>
You have a burning interest in and commitment to a particular
sector or need and want to dig in over the long term.
</p></li><li><p>
You're committed to lowering the financial and technical barriers
to technology access.
</p></li><li><p>
You're up for sharing your work, even though doing so will feel
like pinning a badge to your chest labeled &ldquo;complaints
department&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
You're an open-source evangelist and deeply believe that everyone
is best served when technology is freely available to all.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x2852e00"></a>
Key Concepts in Distribution Authoring</h2></div></div><p>
Before I go into details, here's a quick terminology overview:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>module</em></span> is a plugin that extends Drupal's functionality. The
core Drupal product, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Drupal core</em></span>, ships with a
number of modules, and community contributors have written thousands more.
</p></li><li><p>
An <span   class="emphasis"><em>install profile</em></span> is a special kind of
Drupal module that contains code to be used only when the site is first
installed. Each distribution needs its own install profile.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>feature module</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>feature</em></span>
is a Drupal module produced with the Features module and containing
exported configuration. A distribution typically is made up of multiple
feature modules, each providing a distinct set of functionality.
</p></li><li><p>
The features approach is built on <span   class="emphasis"><em>exportables</em></span>&mdash;APIs that allow configuration from a Drupal site to be exported into
code and reused on other sites.
</p></li><li><p>
An exportable configuration object, often called a
feature <span   class="emphasis"><em>component</em></span>, is uniquely identified by
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>machine-readable name</em></span> or (less frequently) a
universally unique identifier (UUID).
</p></li><li><p>
One or more features and their supporting dependencies can
be packaged together into an <span   class="emphasis"><em>app</em></span> that then can be
installed with the Apps module. Many but not all Drupal distributions
are being built using the apps model.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>base distribution</em></span> is a distribution that's
specifically written to provide commonly needed functionality for use
in other distributions.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x28537a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Some Additional Vocabulary</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>dependency</em></span> is created when one module
requires another in order to function. A dependency can be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hard</em></span> (when module A won't even install if module B isn't
present) or <span   class="emphasis"><em>soft</em></span> (when module A will install but won't
be fully functional without module B). Dependencies are an important
consideration in distribution authoring because they can lead to
incompatibilities between one set of features and another.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>patch</em></span> is a text file containing a suggested
code-level change to an existing piece of code, like a module or Drupal
core.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>theme</em></span> is the set of templates that gives a
site its particular look and feel.
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x2c4bfc8"></a>
Distributions and Interoperability</h2></div></div><p>
Interoperability is the ability of different systems to work
together. When we talk about interoperability and Drupal distributions we
mean: how can we make sure the building blocks of different distributions
fit together in consistent and understandable ways?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
The Origin of Features</b></span>
</p><p>
Much of the toolset for building distributions began with Open
Atrium, a Drupal distribution that provides an advanced, team-based
project management solution. Open Atrium devs took the time to build
out a framework useful not just for their own product but for any
distribution. The result was the Features module and a host of supporting
add-ons.
</p><p>
Features quickly caught on with Drupal distribution developers. But in
using it, they hit a number of snags.
</p><p>
Written on a one-off basis, each distribution had its own particular
logic and structure. If you wanted to extend Open Atrium, you had to wade
in and learn a lot about how that distribution was put together. And if
you loved a particular piece of Open Atrium (say, its event
calendar) and wanted to pull just that feature into your own
site&mdash;well, good
luck. Each feature was highly dependent on a whole set of assumptions
and dependencies specific to the distribution.
</p><p>
Disentangling the Web looked like way more work than it was worth.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kit</b></span>
</p><p>
The Open Atrium devs quickly recognized these issues and dug into
addressing them. The result was Kit, a specification for feature
development. The Kit Feature Specification sets out guidelines that
feature developers can follow to help ensure that different features
integrate seamlessly together, no matter what distribution or purpose
they were built for.
</p><p>
What's in Kit? The good news is mainly some pretty sensible and
easy-to-follow naming conventions. Kit answers questions like: how should
you name the paths to your main feature landing pages? By following Kit,
you'll help ensure that, if your work is combined with other Kit-compliant
features, the result won't be a mishmash of disparate
configuration.
</p><p>
But, there's a lot that didn't make it into Kit. Here are some practical
steps beyond Kit to help ensure that your work integrates seamlessly
with other distributions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x2c4c548"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Why Build Interoperable Features, Apps and
Distributions?</b></p><p>
You're already taking considerable time and effort to build a
distribution. Why put in the extra work to make it interoperable?
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>You'll be able to integrate other features or
apps.</em></span> There's no need to go it alone. By building your
distribution with interoperability foremost in mind, you'll be able to add
in what others already have produced and be able to focus on just the
key pieces that interest you.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>More distros and sites will be able to use your
work.</em></span> It's frustrating to build something and then watch someone
else reproduce pretty much exactly what you already did only with a few
details changed. If you make it easy to do so, others will be more likely
to use, and maybe even contribute back to, what you've begun.
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275a580.0x2c4c9c0"></a>
Practical Steps in Building Interoperable Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
So far, I've been describing distribution building in pretty general
terms. Now it's time to jump into some practical problems and real-world
examples. If you're a developer relatively new to Drupal and some of this
doesn't immediately make a lot of intrinsic sense, don't worry&mdash;it'll
all be a lot clearer after you roll up your sleeves and dig in a bit. And
if code blocks make your eyes swim, just pretend they aren't there&mdash;you
can do a lot without touching a line of code.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Study Up on Existing Distributions</b></span>
</p><p>
A first good step is to get up close and comfortable with some of the
existing distributions. You might choose to build your features on the
same model as those of an existing distribution or feature set, or even
directly add to an existing feature set.
</p><p>
For example, the Debut feature set includes a Debut Feature Specification
that extends and updates Kit, providing guidelines for a higher level of
integration. The Debut project page on drupal.org also links to developer
documentation on building new Debut features.
</p><p>
Other distributions like OpenPublish include detailed documentation
on their Web sites about how to write features or apps that extend the
distribution. Read up!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Consider Building Off a Base Distribution</b></span>
</p><p>
Panopoly is the first distribution written specifically to be a base
for other more-specific distributions. Panopoly tackles some key
administrative, usability and design challenges that any distros
will face. Building a distribution off Panopoly will save you
having to solve all those problems yourself. It also will facilitate
interoperability&mdash;at least with other Panopoly-based distros. The
Panopoly project page on drupal.org includes documentation on how to
base a distribution off of Panopoly.
</p><p>
Spark is a newer initiative that's also tackling usability and design
challenges. It's not yet fully primed to be a base for building other
distros, but discussions are underway, and it's a project to keep an
eye on.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Consider Packaging Your Work as Apps</b></span>
</p><p>
Not everyone is thrilled with the Apps model. Apps makes respected Drupal
developer and evangelist Angie Byron (webchick) wince&mdash;judging by her
comments in a recent thread on drupal.org. Her concerns, to paraphrase,
were that the apps model clouds waters already muddied by features and
modules and whatnot and also detracts from getting usability fixes into
Drupal core and drupal.org where they can help everybody.
</p><p>
That said, well, Apps is being adopted as a tool in many Drupal 7
distributions and can help solve both development and usability issues.
</p><p>
For developers, Apps makes it easier to incorporate features from other
distros into their own. For example, Apps is what facilitates using
Panopoly as the basis of your own distribution.
</p><p>
For site builders, Apps gives a one-click solution for installing a
feature&mdash;complete with all of its dependencies&mdash;on a site that wasn't
based on a distribution.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Don't Re-invent the Feature</b></span>
</p><p>
Even beyond building off a base distribution, you may be able just to
take and use a lot of what you need from existing features. Before
writing yet another event or blog or mapping or social-media feature,
take a good look at what's already out there.
</p><p>
Seriously ask yourself: what would I need to do to use the existing
feature directly in my distribution? Incorporating other people's work can
free you up to focus on what you're really interested in. Think
of it this way: the alternative is having to build and maintain
<span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> yourself. Ouch!
</p><p>
And, what better path to compatibility could there be than actually using
the same code?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Avoid Dependencies of One Feature on Another</b></span>
</p><p>
No, really, avoid them&mdash;even &ldquo;soft&rdquo; dependencies. Unless your new
feature is strictly enhancing an existing feature&mdash;like, say, an
&ldquo;Event
registration&rdquo; feature that enhances an existing &ldquo;Event&rdquo;
feature&mdash;having
dependencies on other features is trouble.
</p><p>
The key problem with dependencies is that they quickly produce
incompatibilities between one set of features and another. The Features
module won't let you enable two different features that have one or more
identically named components of the same type.
You can avoid dependencies through careful planning of how you'll handle
the components that are needed in more than one feature.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Keep Generic Components Out of Features Exportables</b></span>
</p><p>
Take, for example, a user role like &ldquo;administrator&rdquo; or
&ldquo;editor&rdquo;. These
are generic components&mdash;they're going to be needed in many different
features, so that each feature can assign appropriate permissions for
tasks like creating a particular type of content.
</p><p>
Instead of exporting user roles to features, consider having each of
your feature modules create the general-use roles it needs at install
time using regular Drupal APIs. Here's an example of how you might do
this in a module's install file using hook_install(), which Drupal core
calls when a module is first installed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * Implements hook_install().
 *
 * Create "administrator" and "editor" user roles
 * if they don't already exist.
 */
function example_install() {
  $role_names = array('administrator', 'editor');
  foreach ($role_names as $name) {
    // If there isn't an existing role by this
    // name, create one.
    if (!$role = user_role_load_by_name($name)) {
      $role = new StdClass();
      $role-&gt;name = $name;
      user_role_save($role);
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
And, even before you write your own custom install hooks, have a look at
the Apps compatible module, which provides built-in support for handling
shared components like user roles and taxonomy vocabularies.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Enhance Other Features without Requiring Them</b></span>
</p><p>
Say you're writing a feature that adds social-networking links to
different content types. Great&mdash;but which content types should get
the links?
</p><p>
If you hard-code content types from specific features into your social
linking feature, you've introduced either soft or hard dependencies&mdash;and
precluded other feature authors from using the same approach.
Instead, you can build in a flexible responder that enables other
features to register their content types for social linking easily. Here's
an example.
</p><p>
Say you're building a feature that uses the Service links module, which
stores configuration in a variable called
&ldquo;service_links_node_types&rdquo;.
In your feature, include implementations of two Drupal code hooks that
allow you to respond when modules are enabled.
</p><p>
Here's some pseudo code; see the Debut Social feature for a full working
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/**
 * Implements hook_modules_enabled().
 *
 * When a module is enabled, check to see if it is
 * a feature module with a node type designated for
 * social linking.
 */
function example_modules_enabled($modules) {
  $social_types = array();

  // Load info from feature modules and filter to
  // get only the ones that were just installed.
  $features = features_get_features();
  $features = array_intersect_key(
    $features,
    drupal_map_assoc($modules)
  );

  // Iterate through the features.
  foreach ($features as $feature) {
    // Look at the $feature-&gt;info array for node
    // types and an 'example_social_types' key.
    // Add any hits to the $social_types array.
  }
  if (!empty($social_types)) {
    // Merge into the existing variable's value so
    // as not to overwrite existing settings, using
    // variable_get(), array_merge(), and then
    // variable_set().
  }
}

/**
 * Implements hook_enable().
 *
 * When this module is enabled, process any social
 * linking designations for all currently enabled
 * modules.
 */
function example_enable() {
  example_modules_installed(module_list());
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, to get its content type recognized for social linking, a feature
will need only a single line in its .info file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
example_social_types[example_node_type] = example_node_type
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Distinguish between &ldquo;Hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;Soft&rdquo; Configuration</b></span>
</p><p>
Features provide reliable and consistent methods for capturing,
reproducing and updating configuration.
That's exactly what you want with what's sometimes called
&ldquo;hard&rdquo;
configuration: the settings and objects that are core to your feature
or distribution and shouldn't change in different environments&mdash;stuff
like content types and fields.
</p><p>
But there's also &ldquo;soft&rdquo; configuration&mdash;the stuff you might want to
set initially but that site administrators can and should change on each
site. Soft configuration includes things like the default theme used on
the site. You want to set an initial default theme, but any site should
be free to replace that with its own theme choice.
</p><p>
To set soft configuration, you can skip Features and instead use the
regular Drupal API functions like theme_enable() and variable_set().
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Choose Your Layout Solution and Stick with It</b></span>
</p><p>
One of the biggest divides between one distribution and another is
layout&mdash;how are blocks of content arranged on the page? Here, there are
two main options used in distros, each with their myriad advocates.
</p><p>
The Context module enables finely tuned control over block placement on
any site page or section into any region that the site's theme provides.
</p><p>
The Panels module enables even more options for selecting what content
to place, but places content into its own custom layouts and regions
instead of those provided by the site's theme.
</p><p>
If Context was the early champion, the balance may be shifting to Panels,
which appears to be closer to the layout solutions that will go into
Drupal 8 core. The Drupal Commons distro, for example, is switching from
Context to Panels with its Drupal 7 upgrade.
</p><p>
One approach that's used is to pull layout and other user interface
stuff into a separate feature. That way, site builders or distro authors
can choose to use the core of a feature even if they choose a different
layout solution. It's an interesting idea but one that adds some extra
layers of complexity to the feature-building process.
</p><p>
Which to choose is going to be is up to you. But the layout model you
decide on
will have a big impact on how your feature or distro fits with the crowd.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Keep It Stable, Proven and Lean</b></span>
</p><p>
There's a place for trying out the latest experimental alpha release of
a cool module that someone posted last week, but it's probably not in
your distro.
</p><p>
Stick wherever you can with the tried-and-true solutions that any
skilled and experienced developer would choose for the purpose. Use
recommended, stable releases rather than development versions. If you
don't absolutely have to add a new dependency, don't. And avoid patches
like the plague; they're bound to break if a site already has installed
a non-patched version of the code.
</p><p>
Yes, there are exceptions to all of these rules. You might, on rare
occasion, see no choice but to use a development version of a module or
judiciously add a patch to address a critical bug. But every time you do,
keep in mind you're cutting yourself off from other distros or features
that might not have climbed out on the limb you're clinging to.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Save the Truly Specific for Your Install Profile</b></span>
</p><p>
Here's an example from the Open Outreach distribution. Open Outreach is
built for nonprofit organizations, but it's based on Debut features,
which are written to be generic enough to be used on many different
types of sites.
</p><p>
One such feature is for event handling. Debut Event includes an &ldquo;Event
type&rdquo; vocabulary that allows content editors to classify events by
category, with events of each category getting a different color on the
event calendar.
</p><p>
But sticking terms that are specific to the nonprofit organization use case
directly into Debut Event would break the whole idea of a generic
feature. So instead we put just that bit of enhancement into the Open
Outreach install profile, using one of the many code hooks that Drupal
provides for responding to data transactions on the site. Here's code
adapted from openoutreach.profile:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/**
 * Implements hook_modules_installed().
 *
 * Add custom taxonomy terms to the event_type
 * vocabulary if it is created.
 */
function example_entity_insert($entity, $type) {
  if ($type == 'taxonomy_vocabulary' &amp;&amp;
    $entity-&gt;machine_name == 'event_type') {
    $names = array(
      'Conference',
      'Meeting',
      'Workshop'
    );
    foreach ($names as $name) {
      $term = new StdClass();
      $term-&gt;name = $name;
      $term-&gt;vid = $entity-&gt;vid;
      $term-&gt;vocabulary_machine_name =
        $entity-&gt;machine_name;
      taxonomy_term_save($term);
    }
  }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
When the event type vocabulary is created, Open Outreach responds by
adding a few initial event types that nonprofit organizations 
typically might use. The Debut Event feature doesn't have to know or care.

Distributions and Interoperability in Drupal 8</h2></div></div><p>
Version 8 of Drupal core is being developed through a series of
initiatives, each focused on a distinct area of development and headed
up by leaders in the field.
</p><p>
Probably the most sweeping Drupal 8 changes for distributions are coming
out of the configuration management initiative (CMI). This initiative
has given Drupal native support for file-based configuration. A lot
of the workarounds that are necessary to convince Drupal to recognize
code-based configuration in Drupal 7 may soon be a thing of the past.
</p><p>
Big changes of course bring their share of challenges. There's a lot that
still needs to settle out before it'll be clear just how features, apps
and distributions will translate to Drupal 8. But with core Drupal devs
solidly addressing configuration management in Drupal core, the future
of Drupal distributions looks bright.
</p><p>
In the meantime, if you're venturing into the world of apps or features or
distros, take the time to do it right. Draw on the best of what's
out there. And, in turn, make your feature, app or distribution as
interoperable as it can be. Doing so will help others make the most of
your contribution and also help future-proof your work, whatever Drupal
8 brings.
