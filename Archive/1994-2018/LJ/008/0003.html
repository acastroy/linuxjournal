is needed in a kernel is already in the Linux kernel. Linux has one
of the best-designed buffer caches of any Unix-like operating
system. A few things are left to be completed in the memory
management and in the networking layer, but as more and more
development is done, it seems (and reasonably so) that there are
fewer and fewer projects that can be done by people with little
operating systems knowledge and experience. Those who know enough
to know what needs to be done with the memory management don't need
to read documentation on how the kernel works; many of them find it
faster to simply read the Linux source code.
</p><p>That is not to say that there = are few projects in the Linux
community that beginners can do; there are very many, but most of
these projects are not within the kernel itself.</p><p>One project that relative beginners can accomplish, and which
will never go out of fashion, is writing device drivers for new
hardware. There is still hardware that Linux does not support, new
hardware is being released by manufacturers all the time, and Linux
users buy hardware and then want to use it with Linux.</p><p>Fortunately, the interface used to write device drivers is
relatively simple and clean. By clean, I mean that there are not
many exceptions to the rules or little tricks you have to play to
get things to work. Over the next few columns (few is relative, I
could spend a few years at this...) I will cover the information
you need to know to write various kinds of device drivers.</p><p>Some of this information is already in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Kernel Hackers' Guide</em></span>, but I will expand on the
information here. When I write something new here, it will
eventually find its way into the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel Hackers'
Guide</em></span>; this is one way that <i  >Linux Journal</i> supports the Linux Documentation Project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x22a67c0"></a>Devices in User Space</h2></div></div><p>In an almost contradictory way, I'm to initiate this
<span   class="bold"><b>Kernel Korner</b></span> column with a
description of how (and when!) to implement a device driver as a
user program.</p><p>The first rule of adding code to the Linux kernel is don't.
The code that is in the kernel cannot be swapped, and therefore
takes up precious memory whether it is being used at the time or
not. Many hardware devices can be driven by user-space programs
which are kept nicely out of the way (either swapped out or not
running at all) when the device is not being used. One prime
example of devices that are implemented this way are video
cards.</p><p>While the Linux startup code has options to initialize the
video modes for many different kinds of cards, the actual device
support for video cards in the Linux kernel proper is extremely
limited, and is comprised of support for putting text on the screen
on either monochrome (hercules-style) or color (CGA, EGA, VGA, and
above) cards. No support for graphics is included.</p><p>XFree86 provides user-level drivers for many graphics cards
within the X servers. These are only loaded when the X servers are
running, and parts that aren't being used at the moment can be
swapped out when necessary. In addition, by not making the device
use a system-call interface to write, these drivers are faster
because they are implemented in user space.</p><p>There are, of course, drivers that cannot be written as
user-space drivers: most commonly, hardware that requires a driver
that can service interrupts. We'll deal with these in a future
installment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x22a6a80"></a>Talking to Hardware</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps the most common way that a device driver communicates
with hardware (at least on the PC architecture) is through the I/O
bus. This is a bus which is completely separate from the memory
bus, and which is accessed with special machine instructions. For a
concrete example, let's use the parallel port. The parallel port
driver is in the kernel for three reasons: it can be
interrupt-driven, it manages contention, and it has historically
been part of the kernel. It's also reasonably small, and very
common, so it doesn't bloat the kernel very much. However, the
parallel port can be driven from user space. Let's look at how this
could be done.</p><p>The parallel port has three addresses on the I/O bus, and
they are specified by a base address and two offsets. This is
common for devices; many devices have several base addresses to
choose from, and any other ports that are used are specified as
offsets from the base. The three base addresses for the parallel
port are given in <b  >linux/lp.h</b>, and are (in hex)
Ox3bc, Ox378, and Ox278. The status port is the next port above
that, and the control port is above the status port. So if the base
I/O port, to which characters are written, is Ox378, then the
status port is Ox379 and the control port is Ox380.</p><p>Perhaps the most common way that a device driver communicates
with hardware... is through the 1/0 bus.</p><p>You need enough documentation for a device to know how to
talk to it. The 8255 chip is the chip that the parallel port is
based on, and the documentation for that chip and for the parallel
port interface describes the three ports.</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x22a6ce8"></a><p class="title"><b>The status port can report several conditions when it is read:</b></p><table     summary="The status port can report several conditions when it is read:" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>Bit</p></td><td><p>Condition</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ox80</p></td><td><p>If 0, printer is busy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ox40</p></td><td><p>If 0, printer has ACKnowledged the character sent</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ox20</p></td><td><p>If 1, printer is out of paper</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OxlO</p></td><td><p>If 1, printer is on-line</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ox08</p></td><td><p>If 0, printer has in an error condition</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="table"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x22a7898"></a><p class="title"><b>The control port controls several things when it is written:</b></p><table     summary="The control port controls several things when it is written:" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>Bit</p></td><td><p>Condition</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OxlO</p></td><td><p>Set to 1 to enable sending interrupts when the printer is ready</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ox08</p></td><td><p>Set to 1 to tell printer ready to talk</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ox04</p></td><td><p>Set to O to tell printer to initialize itself</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>OxO1</p></td><td><p>Set to 1 to prepare to send another byte to printer</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Unfortunately, not all printers agree about all the signals
that can be sent, so the least common denominator has to be used.
This means that I won't use all of the bits you see in the tables.
Also, I obviously won't use the interrupt-enable bit, since
interrupts can't be used from user-level programs.</p><p>I'm also not going to do any serious error detection; I want
to show how simple it can be to write a simple driver that works
(more or less). If you want to see how error detection could be
handled, simply read <b  >include/linux/lp.h</b> and
<b  >drivers/char/lp.c</b> in the Linux kernel
source.</p><p>The program <b  >userlp.c</b> (see sidebar) needs
to be compiled with optimization fumed on and run as root (or
setuid root) to work. It takes a file from the standard input and
prints it to the printer specified on the command line: O, 1, or 2,
corresponding to lpO, lpi, and lp2, respectively.</p><p>This has only been lightly tested on one printer, unlike the
standard kernel driver, so I can't say that it will work on your
printer. This doesn't matter, because this is only an example. Note
that I could have written the same driver as a /bin/sh script that
used <b  >/dev/port</b> and <b  >dd</b>, and
probably done it in less time, but you are more likely to be
writing a device driver in C than in
<b  >/bin/sh</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x26a0850"></a>Caveats</h2></div></div><p>In order to use <b  >inb_p()</b> and <b  >ou
tb_b()</b>, not only did I have to compile with optimization
on and use <b  >ioperm()</b> to allow access to those
ports, I also had to use <b  >ioperm()</b> to allow
access to port Ox80. This is because the <b  >*b_p ()</b>
functions use port Ox80 to slow down port access.</p><p>I was also lucky in that all my ports were less than Ox3ff.
To access ports higher than Ox3ff, you either need to use
<b  >/dev/port</b> (as will be described below) or, for
fastest access, use the <b  >iopl()</b> function to set
your I/O protection level to &ldquo;ring 3&rdquo;, the same as the kernel. This
is unfortunate (although there are good reasons for it; read
<b  >kernel/ioport.h</b> if you care), because it means
that you can access any port at all, and if you access the wrong
one through some programming error, you may much more easily mess
up the entire machine. Imagine what will happen if your program
accidentally writes &ldquo;random&rdquo; values to one of the I/O ports that
controls the hard drive. At &ldquo;ring 3&rdquo;, code is nearly as powerful as
the kernel, and so one of the advantages of a user-level driver is
gone.</p><p>If you are going to do something as dangerous as use iopl()
to put your code in ring 3, you should probably know how to read
kernel source code, so I will simply refer you to
<b  >kernel/ioport.h</b> for details. System calls are
called sys_<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span> within the kernel, so look for
sys <b  >iopl()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x26a0dd0"></a>if (netuid_root == BLEcH | | iopl(3) ==
SCARY)</h2></div></div><p>Note that I used the <b  >ioperm()</b> function to
read and write directly from and to the ports with the
<b  >inb_p()</b> and <b  >outb_b()</b>
functions, and that this function requires that the code run as
root. Another option is to read and write from
<b  >/dev/port</b>. This is a little slower, but has the
advantage that the code does not require root permissions to run;
just read and write permission to <b  >/dev/port</b>.
Simply use <b  >lseek()</b> to seek to the address of the
port you want to read from or write to, and
<b  >read()</b> or <b  >write()</b> a single
byte to the file. If you want to read or write again, you need to
use <b  >lseek()</b> again. If you make a group called
port and make <b  >/dev/port</b> readable and writable by
group port, then any user in group port can use user-space device
drivers written in this way without the programs being setuid
root.</p><p>Another way to access <b  >/dev/port</b> is to use
<b  >mmap()</b> to map it into some memory space. Then
you can write to ports directly at the memory address you map them
to. See the section on memory mapping, below, to learn how to map
files; the details (other than the filename) are the same. Since
perl can use the <b  >mmap()</b> call, it is possible to
write device drivers that access <b  >/dev/port</b> and
<b  >/dev/mem</b> as perl scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x26a1458"></a>Memory</h2></div></div><p>Other devices may need to be accessed at some place in
physical memory. The first 3GB of physical memory (if you have more
memory than that and don't know how to access the 4th gigabyte, you
don't have my sympathy...) can be accessed through
<b  >/dev/mem</b>. The sidebar (at left on page 20) gives
a rough version of the <b  >mmap()</b> code from svgalib,
which, like XFree86, is a user-space device driver for video cards:
</p><p>The code first opens /dev/mem, then allocates enough memory
to map the section of /dev/mem it wants into, and then maps
/dev/mem over the already allocated memory. Once this has been
successfully done, whenever that process writes to or reads from
that memory, it is writing to or reading from physical memory at
the address that <b  >/dev/mem</b> was mapped to.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21ae580.0x26a16c0"></a>Cute Note</h2></div></div><p>Since perl can use the <b  >mmap()</b> call, it is
possible to write device drivers that access
<b  >/dev/port</b> and <b  >/dev/mem</b> as
perl scripts. If you don't already use perl, it's probably not
worth it, but if you do use perl, you may find the idea intriguing.
If you try it, I'd like to know how it works for you, and if you
have any hints, I may pass them on to the readers of this column.
Similarly, it is technically possible (although in practice &ldquo;too
clever by half&rdquo; and rather slow) to write a device driver as a
shell script, by using <b  >dd</b> to read and write
ports. Just to be contrary, I worked on such a driver, and found
that the chief problems are the lack of binary bit-wise operations
and lack of real binary data. I am not distributing this shell
script; anyone who seriously cares about playing in this way can
cook up their own based on the <b  >userlp.c</b> file
presented in this column. If you get it to work reliably, please
notify me, and I may print your version in a future Kernel
Korner.</p><p><a href="0003l1.jpg" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p><a href="0003l2.jpg" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></div></div>
