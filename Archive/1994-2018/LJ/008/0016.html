the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. To his great surprise he found it, and then
declared that this was a book worth having. After using this
dictionary for the past two months, I have to agree; and not just
because it contains a definition for Linux in it.</p><p>The book includes over 6,000 entries and does a fairly good
job of keeping definitions as free of jargon as possible. As a
result, it can be used by people with a broad range of Unix
experience, from the &ldquo;newbie&rdquo; (not defined, but we know what that
is!) to the &ldquo;wizard&rdquo;.</p><p>As the Assistant Editor for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and a fairly new sysadmin, the book has come in
handy quite a few times. I've used it to figure out what POSIX
really stands for (Portable Operating System Interface for computer
environments (X)), and I've used it to better understand what I
read in articles that are submitted to <i  >Linux Journal</i> for publication.</p><p>The book contains such basic terms as: pop-up window (with a
figure showing one), command line, directory, port, space bar,
kernel (with the standard bull's-eye graphic), software, CPU, and
edit. These are all described so that true computer novices can
better understand computers. Lots of acronyms are included, like
ASCII, FTP, TCP/IP, VMS, SCSI, RISC, MTA, and LAN.</p><p>There's information on Unix-style word processing: serif,
sans serif, roff, nroff, troff, and mm macros.</p><p>Important people: Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.</p><p>Unix operating systems: SVR, BSD, UNIX, XENIX, and
SunOS.</p><p>The Information superhighway: Internet, WWW, nslookup,
archie, gopher, WAIS, hypertext, T-1, PPP.</p><p>Sysadmin terms: wtmp, sendmail.cf, mountd, mnttab, named.
local, /dev/null, DNS, telinit, a whole bunch of /etc/*
entries.</p><p>This book even contains historical gossip about the
Michelangelo virus!</p><p>What don't I like about the book? It includes pronunciations
of words, like WA-BEE, SCUZZY, NAME-D, NROFF, GOO-IE, etc., listed
as entnes. I think it's kind of hokey. But these pronunciations are
also included with the &ldquo;real&rdquo; definitions, and the dictionary does
a very good job of cross-referencing.</p><p>It also includes a scattering of figures and tables which
enhance the text definitions.</p><p>At the end of the book there are a number of useful
appendices, including references for basic vi commands, basic Emacs
commands, FTP commands, lpc commands, RFS parameters, signal values
(preSVR4, SVR4, BSD), Telnet stuff, and some commonly used
talk-mode jargon.</p><p>Five years ago, Bill Holt decided that this was a book he
needed. Since there wasn't one available, he and Rockie Morgan
wrote it. That's one of the best reasons for creating something,
and this dictionary is something I'm glad I have.</p></div></div>
