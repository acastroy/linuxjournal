about Linux in your fonum stating that Linux documentation is
worthless, Linux code is unreadable, and some Linux soffware is
annoyingly unreliable.</p><p>I would like to retract, and apologize for, any statements I
made about documentation or code. Documentation problems resuited
from my not having read the Linux installation brochure carefully
enough and from having missed the whence command. My code problems
resulted from having picked a particularly obscure and locally
undocumented bit of code (profil. c) as the first arid only test
case. Having now used whence a few times and browsed around some
other code in the LGX (Yggdrasil) Linux distribution, I find that
the quality of almost all documentation and code readability ranges
between pretty good and very good.</p><p>I still regard Linux as noticeably less reliable as a whole
than the other Unix system I've used extensively, namely SunOS.
Although I have found the Linux kernel Qile system, process
scheduler, etc.) and shell to be extremely reliable, there are
several specific problems in other parts of the system that are a
source of ongoing annoyance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If the X server ever nuns out of swap space, the
entire machine locks up and I have to reboot. (I usually can't just
shut down the server gracefully.)</p></li><li><p>gdb gets badly confused by optimized code, showing
bogus variable values with no indication that they are
bogus.</p></li><li><p>Attempting to debug profiled (-pg) code with gab
offen results in strange, non-resumable traps when
singlestepping.</p></li><li><p>Profiling sometimes produces very large variations
in observed times when running under X-Windows. I find I have to
shut down X in order to get repeatable results.</p></li><li><p>Having done a partially CD-ROM-based installation,
I find the CD-ROM being invoked at unpredictable times and for odd
functions; for example, just to do a ls 1 in the current
(non-CD-ROM) directory.</p></li></ul></div><p>Despite these problems, I have found Linux to be an excellent
value for the price I would have paid for it (S99) if Yggdrasil
hadn't sent me a free copy S99 won't even buy a decent C compiler
in the PC world.L. Peter Deutsch,Aladdin

system. (I have used Unix for years at the low and high level at
work and school.) I've been piddling with the idea of putting Linux
on my box at home, and I even have a new 1GB hard drive (in
addition to the 500MB one) just screaming to have Linux run its
hands all over the cylinders. Affer reading the HOWTOs and the
installguide, I was sure I could install Linux on my PC. I've
installed other Unix OS stuff on other machines (okay,
once).</p><p>However, your article &ldquo;Cooking with Linux&rdquo; (issue #5),
finally pushed me over the edge. It leff me rolling on the floor in
some places and it leff me with a feeling that I have a moral
responsibility to wake up and use that other 95% of my
brain.</p><p>Oh, and it convinced me to install Linux at home, too.</p><p>Thanks.Lewis W.

in issue #5 of Linux lournaL I was wondering if you might have an
idea as how to set the color schemes in C mode for such things as
reserved words, comments, strings, etc.Thanks in advance.Mike
Clarkaseng@bsinet.com</p><p>MATT RESPONDS</p><p>The article describes how to set the faces &ldquo;bold&rdquo;,
&ldquo;underline&rdquo;, &ldquo;italic&rdquo; and so forth. These are achually used within
C mode to set colors for reserved words, stnngs, and so
forth.</p><p>However, if you do <b  >M-x apropos</b> face you
will get a list of functions and variables containing the word
&ldquo;face&rdquo;. These include:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
font-lock-comment-face
        Variable: Face to use for comments.
font-lock-doc-string-face
        Variable:       Face to use for documentation strings.
font-lock-function-name-face
        Variable:       Face to use for function names.
font-lock-keyword- face
        Variable: Face to use for keywords.
font-lock-string-face
        Variable:       Face to use for string constants.
font-lock-type-face
Variable:       Face to use for data types.
</pre><p>Apparently, these are the faces used within Font Lock mode
(described in the article) for the features you mentioned. I have
notpersonally experimented with these faces, and they appear to be
undocumented. Your mileage may vary. 10</p></div></div>
