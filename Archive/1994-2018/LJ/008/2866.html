    In this article Jeff looks at a useful and perhaps little
    known feature of Linux&mdash;the ability to pass command line
    parameters to the kernel during system startup.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x219d3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Consider the following situations:
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Scenario 1</b></span>: You are
installing Linux from CDROM, but the kernel isn't using the correct
I/O address for your CD-ROM drive. You can correct this by
recompiling the kernel, but to build the kernel you first need to
install Linux from CD-ROM...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Scenario 2</b></span>: You made a
change to the system startup script rc.local and now your system
hangs while booting. How can you fix the error without reinstalling
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Scenario 3</b></span>: You'd like to
experiment with the various VGA console video modes available
without having to recompile the kernel each time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Scenario 4</b></span>: You've just
written a large application that runs well on your system. How well
would it run on a friend's machine that has only 4MB of RAM and no
floating point coprocessor?</p><p>One solution to each of these problems is provided by Linux
and its ability to pass command line parameters to the kernel.
Unfortunately, these options are not well documented, (some of the
HOWTOs mention certain options in passing, e.g., the SCSI HOWTO
mentions some SCSI related options) and a number of them have been
added relatively recently. We'll explore them in this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x219d7c0"></a>Booting Linux</h2></div></div><p>In order to understand how command line parameters fit into
the scheme of things, let's briefly look at what happens when Linux
boots.</p><p>For those who aren't afraid to look at kernel source code,
I'll mention some of the relevant files. The filenames given are
relative to wherever you have installed the kernel source, usually
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b>. Therefore, a reference to the
file <b  >boot/bootsect.S</b> should be found in
<b  >/usr/src/linux/boot/bootsect.S</b>. This information
is valid for Linux kernel version 1.2.</p><p>Starting from power on, the PC ROM BIOS routines load boot
code from floppy or hard disk. If booting from hard disk, this is
usually the boot loader installed by LILO. If booting fJ5m floppy,
it is the code in the file <b  >boot/bootsect.S</b>. This
in turn loads the code found in <b  >boot/setup.S</b> and
runs it. This module reads some information from the BIOS (the VGA
mode, amount of memory, etc.) and makes note of it for later use.
It will be needed later as the BIOS routines will not (normally) be
used once the kernel starts up.</p><p>The setup code next switches to protected (32-bit) mode, then
loads and runs the code found in <b  >boot/head.S</b>.
(Actually, for compressed kernels, which is always the case in
recent kernels, the kernel proper is first uncompressed using the
code found in <b  >zBoot/head.S</b>). This sets up more
of the 32-bit environment, gets the command-line parameters
(usually from LILO), and passes them to the routine
<b  >start_kernel</b>.</p><p>Up to now everything was written in assembly language. At
this point we now switch to the function
<b  >start_kernel</b>, written in C, found in the file
<b  >init/main.c</b>. This is the code that does most of
the option parsing, saving information on a number of
kernel-specific parameters in global variables so that they can be
used by the kernel when needed.</p><p>Any other parameters given as &ldquo;name=value&rdquo; pairs are passed
as arguments and environment variables to the next process.</p><p>This first kernel process now sets some things up for
multitasking, and makes the first call to the fork system call,
creating a new process; we are now multitasking. The original
(parent) process becomes the &ldquo;idle process&rdquo; which is executed
whenever there are no processes ready to run. The child process
(which has process id 1) calls the program <b  >init</b>.
(It actually looks in a number of places, including
<b  >/etc/init</b>, <b  >/bin/init</b>,
<b  >/sbin/init</b>, <b  >/etc/rc</b>, and
finally <b  >/bin/sh</b>.) The init program then starts
up all of the initial system processes such as getty and other
daemons, and shortly we have a login prompt on the console.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x219e058"></a>Setting Parameters At Kernel Compile
Time</h2></div></div><p>There are a number of important options that can be set when
compiling the Linux kernel. These include the root device, swap
device, and VGA video mode. The toplevel Makefile allows setting
most of these.</p><p>The problem with this method is that recompiling the kernel
is somewhat time-consuming (at least on my machine; do you have a
100MHz Pentium?). You must also modify the standard Makefile, and
remember to continue to do so when upgrading to newer
kernels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x219e1b8"></a>Setting Parameters Using
<b  >rdev</b></h2></div></div><p>The <b  >rdev</b> command was written long ago to
make it easier to set some of these important kernel options
without a recompile. The program directly patches the appropriate
variables in a kernel image. These are at fixed addresses (defined
in <b  >boot/bootsect.S</b>).</p><p>While using <b  >rdev</b> is fast, it is still
somewhat inconvenient in that you have to remember to run it after
building each kernel. It is also limited in the options that can be
changed. We can do better.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x219e478"></a>Setting Parameters Using LILO</h2></div></div><p>If you are using the LILO (LInux LOader) program to boot
Linux (usually from hard disk), then you can pass command-line
options to the kernel at boot time. Typically these are set in the
configuration file <b  >/etc/lilo.conf</b>.</p><p>This is the most flexible method. It allows you, for example,
to boot different kernels or boot the same kernel with different
options.</p><p>Most options are passed by LILO on to the kernel; one useful
option is parsed and handled by LILO itself. ,The console video
mode for VGA displays can be set using a command-line option of the
form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
vga=mode
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>mode</em></span> can be one of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;normal&rdquo; for the default 80-column by 24-line
display,</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;extended&rdquo; or &ldquo;ext&rdquo; for 80 columns by 50
lines,</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;ask&rdquo; to prompt the user at boot up time for the
mode to use, or</p></li><li><p>a decimal number to select various other modes,
dependent on the type of VGA card (for example, on my Trident VGA
card, mode 6 is 132x30).</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x219eaa8"></a>Kernel-Specific Parameters</h2></div></div><p>Let's now look at the specific options supported by the Linux
kernel. These affect the behavior of the kernel itself and are not
passed on to the <b  >init</b> program.</p><p>Some of these options accept a numeric value, parsed by a
simplified version of the strtoul library function. Values can be
given in decimal (e.g., 1234), octal (e.g., 01234) or hexadecimal
(e.g., 0x1234), and should be separated by spaces. Let's now
examine each of the options.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
root=device
</pre><p>e.g.,<b  >root=/dev/hda</b>
</p><p>This option sets the root device; the device used as the root
(&ldquo;/&rdquo;) filesystem; when booting. It accepts a value from a
hard-coded list of common devices: <b  >/dev/hda..b</b>
(IDE hard disks), <b  >/dev/sda..e</b> (SCSI disks),
<b  >/dev/fd</b> (floppy), and
<b  >/dev/xda..b</b> (XT hard disks). These are mapped
into the corresponding major and minor device numbers.</p><p>This option indicates that the root filesystem should be
mounted readonly. Typically this is done in order to run
<b  >fsck</b> on bootup.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rw
</pre><p>This option is the converse of the previous one, indicating
that the root filesystem should be mounted for both read and write,
the normal case once a Linux system has been booted.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
debug
</pre><p>This option sets the kernel logging level to 10, rather than the
default value of 7. It sets the global variable &ldquo;console_loglevel&rdquo;.
Currently this make no visible difference; apparently there is no
kemel code that displays messages at levels higher than 7.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
no-hlt
</pre><p>This sets the global variable &ldquo;hlt_works_ok&rdquo; to 0. When Linux is
idle, it runs the previously mentioned idle process in a loop
(found in <b  >kernel/sys.c</b>). Having the idle process
periodically execute a <b  >hlt</b> (halt) instruction
reduces power consumption on some machines, most notably laptops.
However, a few users have reported problems with the kilt
instruction on certain machines, so it can be disabled with this
option.
</p><p>Incidently, I routinely use this option on my desktop system;
I find that it significantly reduces the level of bus noise picked
up on my sound card.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
no387
</pre><p>This option sets the global variable &ldquo;hard_math&rdquo; to 0. It
forces the kernel to use co-processor emulation, even if one is
installed. This can be useful if you suspect hardware problems with
your co-processor or if you want to measure performance without a
math chip.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mem=bytes
</pre><p>e.g., <b  >mem=4000000</b>
</p><p>This option specifies to the kernel the highest memory
address to use (specified in bytes). Normally Linux uses all of the
available memory. This feature can be useful for simulating
machines with less memory or debugging cache problems on machines
with lots of memory. As an experiment, try booting your machine
with less memory, say 2MB, to highlight the difference memory
makes. As another experiment, see what happens if you lie and tell
Linux you have more memory than is installed...</p><pre     class="programlisting">
reserve=port, size. . .
</pre><p>e.g., <b  >reserve=Ox320,0x20</b>
</p><p>This option reserves I/O ports; it marks them as used so they
will not be probed by device drivers that do autoprobing. This may
be needed on certain systems that have unusual hardware or device
conflicts.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ramdisk=size
</pre><p>e.g., <b  >ramdisk=2000000</b></p><p>This option sets the size of the RAM disk, in bytes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x2196048"></a>Device-Driver-Specific Parameters</h2></div></div><p>The next group of options are specific to individual kernel
device drivers. I won't describe each of them in detail, because
some of them are rather specialized and are documented
elsewhere.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ether=a,b,c,d,e
</pre><p>This option is for setting up Ethernet interfaces. It allows
setting parameters such as the interrupt request number and base
address. The meaning of the parameters varies somewhat depending on
the type of interface card. The Ethernet HOWTO document describes
these in detail.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
max_scsi_luns=number
</pre><p>This option sets the highest Logical Unit Number to be used for
SCSI devices. Valid values are 1 through S. This may be needed if
autoprobing of the SCSI bus causes problems on your system.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
hd=cylinders, heads, sectors
</pre><p>This option sets the hard disk geometry for SCSI or IDE disks.
Normally Linux obtains these from the BIOS; the command line option
can be used to override those if they are not correct.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
st=buffer size,write_threshold,tape_buffers
</pre><p>This option is for setting SCSI tape driver parameters. The file
<b  >drivers/scsi/README.st</b> describes these in
detail.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bmouse=irq
</pre><p>This option sets the interrupt request line to be used for the bus
   mouse driver.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
stOx=parameters
tmc8xx=parameters
stOx=parameters
tl28=parameters
pasl6=parameters
ncr5380=parameters
ncr5380=parameters
ahal52x=parameters
</pre><p>These are all options for setting up the various SCSI host adaptors
supported by the Linux kernel. See the SCSI HOWTO for more
information.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xd=type, irq,i/o base_address,dma_channel
</pre><p>This option sets the XT hard disk driver parameters. See the
comments in the file <b  >drivers/block/xd.c</b> for more
information.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mcd=port, irq, workaround_bug
</pre><p>This sets up the Mitsumi CD-ROM interface. The first two parameters
are the base I/O address for the controller and the interrupt
request. The third option sets a delay value used to work around
problems with some Mitsumi drives.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sound=parml, parm2,...
</pre><p>These options set up the sound driver. The parameter encoding is
explained in the file
<b  >drivers/sound/Readme.linux</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sbpcd=address, type
</pre><p>e.g., <b  >stpod=Ox230,SoundBlaster</b>
</p><p>This command sets the parameters for the
SoundBlaster/Panasonic CD-ROM driver. See the file
drivers/block/README.stpod for details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x21969e8"></a>Parameters to <b  >init</b></h2></div></div><p>Any other options are passed on to init in its argv array and
as environment variables. For example, LILO passes the argument
&ldquo;auto&rdquo; if the system was booted without a manually entered command
line. The command &ldquo;single&rdquo; will instruct init to boot up Linux in
single-user mode.</p><p>Here is how to see what options were passed to
<b  >init</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% ps -awww | grep init
        1 con S 0:03 init auto
</pre><p>The proc filesystem also lets you look at the environment
passed to <b  >init</b>, which always has process ID
number 1:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% cat /proc/l/environ | tr t'\O'' "\n"
        HOME=/
        TERM=conl32x30
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20a5580.0x2196d58"></a>Final Comments</h2></div></div><p>A colleague suggested a kernel option that is missing:
&ldquo;help&rdquo;. While this is not implemented yet, hopefully this article
has convinced you that there are many other useful options worth
exploring.</p></div></div>
