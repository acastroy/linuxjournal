    This month's article deals with your system clock and how
    you can set up your clock in Linux and keep it updated.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf34580.0x102c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>It may not appear difficult to keep your
clock set correctly. DOS had the ability to set its time directly
from the BIOS (Basic In/Out System) and you could set the BIOS time
directly from DOS. Now you have to worry about time zones, machine
time vs. software time, and finding out how to set the time when
your system could be off by 30 seconds every day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf34580.0x102c3f8"></a><b  >zoneinfo</b></h2></div></div><p>It's easy to set up your system for the correct time and if
you're networked, it's easy to keep your time updated. First, get a
copy of the zoneinfo package. For releases like Slackware, it is
already installed (and may be already set up in Slackware 1.2.0 and
later). Look for the <b  >/usr/lib/zoneinfo</b>
directory. If you don't have that directory, get a copy of the
package (see sidebar &ldquo;Finding zoneinfo&rdquo;) and install it.</p><p>For the best setup, you should set your BIOS (or hardware)
clock for GMT (or Zulu, Universal time, or whatever you want to
call it). The advantage of having your BIOS clock set to GMT is
that Linux will automatically handle daylight savings time
conversions for your particular area. You may not want to do this
if you still use DOS, but I find that DOOM does not care what time
I play. I also found that people in the office think you're really
dedicated when you bring in files with time stamps of
2:30AM.</p><p>The first thing you should do is boot into Linux and go into
the <b  >/usr/lib/zoneinfo</b> directory. You should see
a list of various time zones. Some are listed by country, some have
directories with more listings under them (such as the US
directory). Find the file that works with your country or time
zone. For my system, this would be the US/Eastern file, as I am in
the Eastern Time Zone for the US. If your country is not listed,
there is a list of files that relate to times + or - to GMT, such
as GMT-6. Find out how far off you are from GMT, and use that file
instead.</p><p>From here, I create a symbolic link from
<b  >/usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime</b> to
<b  >/usr/lib/zoneinfo/US/Eastern</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -sf /usr/lib/zoneinfo/US/Eastern /usr/lib/
zoneinfo/localtime
</pre><p>Another file to link is the posixrules file. This can be
linked to localtime. If you have the TZ variable set, the
<b  >posixrules</b> link will be used to set the correct
time zone.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /usr/lib/zoneinfo/
localtime /usr/lib/
zoneinfo/posixrules
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf34580.0x102c920"></a><b  >clock</b></h2></div></div><p>If your BIOS clock is set to GMT, you have to tell Linux this
using the clock command. The best way to do it is edit your
<b  >/etc/rc.d/rc.local</b> file (or
<b  >/etc/rc.local</b> file if you don't have an
<b  >rc.d</b> directory) and add the following command
anywhere in the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#Tell Linux the BIOS
is universal time!
clock -us
</pre><p>Or if you have your clock set to local time:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#Tell Linux that the BIOS is set for local time
already!
clock -s
</pre><p>The <b  >-s</b> option indicates to set the clock,
and the -u option indicates that the BIOS clock is set to
'universal time', or GMT.</p><p>From now on, when you use the <b  >date</b> command
to view the time, you will see the correct local time, along with
the time zone you are in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#date Thu Aug 10 22:15:35 EDT 1994
</pre><p>It's easy to set up your system for the correct time and if
you're networked, it's easy to keep your time updated.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf34580.0x102cea0"></a><b  >netdate</b></h2></div></div><p>If you're networked to other machines with a better sense of
time than yours, you can use the netdate command to periodically
keep your machine time correct. As root on your machine, just enter
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
netdate [ -v ] [ -l limit ] &lt;hostl&gt; ... &lt;hostn&gt;
</pre><p>where <b  >hostl...hostn</b> is a list of hosts. It
is usually best to list hosts that are physically close to your
system, especially if you're using a dial-up PPP or SLIP.
</p><p>The way neLdate works is to collect the hosts into groups
based on how close the times are. Of the hosts with the times
closest to the local time, the first alphabetical host of that
group is used to set the time on the local host. The
<b  >-v</b> option will list the groups that get created,
and the <b  >-1 limit</b> option varied the amount of
time that netdate will wait for time information from other hosts
to come in. A limit of 0 will accept the time of the first host
that responds and ignore all the others.</p><p>However, netGate does not update your BIOS clock, only the
system clock. To update the BIOS clock, use the <b  >clock
-uw</b> command to 'write' universal time, or <b  >clock
-w</b> if you keep your BIOS set to local time. One idea you
may want to try is creating a shell script which executes the
netdate and clock commands automatically and keep it in your
<b  >/etc</b> directory. This way, if you notice the time
is a bit off, you can execute the shell script to update the time,
and update your BIOS clock simultaneously.</p><p>If you are interested in doing more with the time zones,
check out the man pages for <b  >date</b>,
<b  >clock</b>, and <b  >netdate</b>. Also in
the <b  >/usr/lib/zoneinfo</b> directory is a
<b  >time.doc</b> text file which is good reading.</p></div></div>
