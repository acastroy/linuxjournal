    One of the main tenets of the Unix philosophy is using the
    right tool for the right job. Here is a well-crafted tool
    well-suited for many large jobs that are diffficult to do
    well in C.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Suppose you want to develop a large,
complex application for Linox. The application is going to be
multiprocess, perhaps distributed, and definitely has to have a
GUI. You want to build this application fairly quickly, and you
want it to be relatively bug free.
</p><p>One of the first questions you might ask yourself is &ldquo;What
programming language and environment should I use?&rdquo; C might be a
good choice, but probably not for this project. It doesn't scale as
well as you'd like, and the tools for doing
multiprocess/distributed programming for C just aren't there. You
might consider C++, but the language is fairly complex. Also, you
and others have discovered from past experience that a fair amount
of time goes into debugging subtle memory management
problems.</p><p>There is an alternative, the Modula-3 programming system from
Digital Equipment Corporation's Systems Research Center (SRC).
Modula-3 is a modern, modular, object-oriented language. The
language features garbage collection, exception handling, run-time
typing, generics, and support for multithreaded applications. The
SRC implementation of this language features a native-code
compiler; an incremental, generational, conservative, multithreaded
garbage collector (whew!); a minimal recompilation system; a
debugger; a rich set of libraries; support for building distributed
applications; a distributed objectoriented scripting language; and,
finally, a graphical user interface builder for distributed
applications. In short, the ideal environment for the type of
application outlined above. Moreover, the system is freely
available in source form, and pre-built Linux binaries are
available as well.</p><p>The remainder of this article will touch on the pertinent
features of the language and provide an overview of the libraries
and tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c660"></a>The Basics of the Modula-3 Language</h2></div></div><p>One of the principal goals for the Modula-3 language was to
be simple and comprehensible, yet suitable for building large,
robust, long-lived applications and systems. The language design
process was one of consolidation and not innovation; that is, the
goal was to consolidate ideas from several different languages,
ideas that had proven useful for building large sophisticated
systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c768"></a>Features of Modula-3</h2></div></div><p>You can think of Modula-3 as starting with Pascal and
re-inventing it to make it suitable for real systems development.
Beginning with a Pascal-like base, features were integrated that
were deemed necessary for writing real applications. These features
fall roughly into two areas: those which make the language more
suitable for structuring large systems, and those which make it
possible to do &ldquo;machine-level&rdquo; programming. Real applications need
both of these.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4c870"></a>Supporting Large Systems Development</h2></div></div><p>There are several features in Modula-3 that support
structuring of large systems. First is the separation of interface
from implementation. This allows for system evolution as
implementations evolve without affecting the clients of those
interfaces; no one is dependent on how you implement something,
only what you implement. As long as the what stays constant, the
how can change as much as is needed.</p><p>Secondly, it provides a simple single-inheritance object
system. There is a fair amount of controversy over what the proper
model for multiple inheritance (MI) is. I have built systems that
use multiple-inheritance extensively and have implemented
programming environments for a language that supports MI.
Experience has taught me that MI can complicate a language
tremendously (both conceptually and in terms of implementation) and
can also complicate applications.</p><p>Modula-3 has a particularly simple definition of an object.
In Modula-3, an object is a record on the heap with an associated
method suite. The data fields of the object define the state and
the method suite defines the behavior. The Modula-3 language allows
the state of an object to be hidden in an implementation module
with only the behavior visible in the interface. This is different
than C++ where a class definition lists both the member data and
member function. The C++ model reveals what is essentially private
information (namely the state) to the entire world. With Modula-3
objects, what should be private can really be private.</p><p>One of the most important features in Modula-3 is garbage
collection. Garbage collection really enables robust, long-lived
systems. Without garbage collection, you need to define conventions
about who owns a piece of storage. For instance, if I pass you a
pointer to a structure, are you allowed to store that pointer
somewhere? If so, who is responsible for de-allocating the
structure in the future? You or me? Programmers wind up adopting
such conventions as the explicit use of reference counts to
determine when it is safe to deallocate storage. Unfortunately,
programmers are not very good about following conventions. The net
result is that programs develop storage leaks or the same piece of
storage is mistakenly used for two different purposes. Also, in
error situations, it may be difficult to free the storage. In C, a
longjmp may cause storage to be lost if the procedure being unwound
doesn't get a chance to clean up. Exception handling in C++ has the
same problems. In general, it is very difficult to manually reclaim
storage in the face of failure. Having garbage collection in the
language removes all of these problems. Better yet, the garbage
collector that is provided with the SRC implementation of Modula-3
has excellent performance. It is the result of several years of
production use and tuning.</p><p>Most modern systems and applications have some flavor of
asynchrony in them. Certainly all GUI-based applications are
essentially asynchronous. Inputs to a GUI-based application are
driven by the user. Multiprocess and multi-machine applications are
essentially asynchronous as well. Given this, it is surprising that
very few languages provide any support at all for managing
concurrency. Instead, they &ldquo;leave it up to the programmer&rdquo;. More
often than not, programmers do this through the use of timers and
signal handlers. While this approach suffices for fairly simple
applications, it quickly falls apart as applications grow in
complexity or when an application uses two different libraries,
both of which try to implement concurrency in their own way. If you
have ever programmed with Xt or Motif, then you are aware of the
problems with nested event loops. There needs to be some standard
mechanism for concurrency.</p><p>Modula-3 provides such a standard interface for creating
threads. In addition, the language itself includes support for
managing locks. The standard libraries provided in the SRC
implementation are all thread-safe. Trestle, which is a library
providing an interface to X, is not only thread-safe, but itself
uses threads to carry out long operations in the background. With a
Trestle-based application, you can create a thread to carry out
some potentially long-running operation in response to a
mouse-button click. This thread runs in the background without
tying up the user interface. It is a lot simpler and less error
prone than trying to accomplish the same thing with signal handlers
and timers.</p><p>Generic interfaces and modules are a key to reuse. One of the
principal uses is in defining container types such as stacks,
lists, and queues. They allow container objects to be independent
of the type of entity contained. Thus, one needs to define only a
single &ldquo;Table&rdquo; interface that is then instantiated to provide the
needed kind of &ldquo;Table&rdquo;, whether an integer table, or a
floatingpoint table or some other type of table is needed. Modula-3
generics are cleaner than C++ parameterized types, but provide much
of the same flexibility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4cb88"></a>Supporting Machine-Level Programming</h2></div></div><p>One of the important lessons from C was that there are times
that real systems need to be programmed essentially at the machine
level. This power has been nicely integrated into the
Modula-3.</p><p>Any module that is marked as unsafe has full access to
machine-dependent operations such as pointer arithmetic,
unconstrained allocation and de-allocation of memory, and
machine-dependent arithmetic. These capabilities are exploited in
the implementation of the Modula-3 I/O system. The lowest levels of
the I/O system are written to make heavy use of machine-dependent
operations to eliminate bottlenecks.</p><p>In addition, existing (non-Module-3) libraries can be
imported. Many existing C libraries make extensive use of
machine-dependent operations. These can be imported as &ldquo;unsafe&rdquo;
interfaces. Then, safer interfaces can be built on top of these
while still allowing access to the unsafe features of the libraries
for those applications that need them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4cd40"></a>The Modula-3 Programming System</h2></div></div><p>How often have you avoided changing a base header file in a
C/C++ system because you didn't want to recompile the world? How
many times have you restructured your header files, not because it
was the right thing to do, but because you needed to cut down on
the number of recompilations after each change?</p><p>The SRC implementation of Modula-3 has a rather elegant
solution to this problem. If an item in an interface is changed,
only those units that depend on that particular item will be
recompiled. That is, dependencies are recorded on an item basis,
not on an interface file basis. This means much less recompilation
after each set of changes.</p><p>m3gdb is a version of GDB that has been modified to
understand and debug Modula-3 programs. One of the nice features of
m3gOb is that it understands M3 threads and allows you to switch
from thread to thread when debugging a problem.</p><p>Also very exciting is Siphon. Siphon is a set of servers and
tools to support multi-set development. The basic idea is that you
can create a set of packages. A package is just a collection of
source files and documentation. Siphon provides a simple model for
checking out and checking in a package. Checking out a package
locks it so that no one else can check it out and modify the
contents. This probably doesn't sound that exciting. The exciting
thing that Siphon does is to automatically propagate modified files
to other sites when the package is checked back in. It does this in
such way that packages are never seen in a &ldquo;half-way&rdquo; state; that
is where part of the sources have been copied but not yet all of
them. Further, it does this in the face of failure. One of the
really interesting parts of multi-site development is making sure
that everyone has the most recent copy of the sources. This is
especially hard when communication links can go down. Siphon takes
care of all of these problems for you. A system like Siphon can
save you considerable amounts of work if you are involved in
multi-site development. By the way, Siphon is not restricted to
Modula-3 source files. It can manage any type of source or
documentation file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4cf50"></a>The Libraries</h2></div></div><p>A good, simple object-oriented language makes a nice starting
point, but that in itself probably doesn't provide sufficient
motivation for considering a new language. Real productivity comes
about when there are good reusable libraries. This is one of the
real strengths of SRC Modula-3 system. It provides a large set of
&ldquo;industrial strength&rdquo; libraries. Most of these libraries are the
result of a number of years of use and refinement. They are as
well- or better-documented than most commercially available
libraries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d058"></a>Libm3</h2></div></div><p>Libm3 is the workhorse library for Modula-3. It is the
Modula-3 equivalent of libc (the standard C library), but it is
considerably richer.</p><p>Libm3 defines a set of abstract types for I/O; these are
called &ldquo;readers&rdquo; and &ldquo;writers&rdquo;. Readers and writers present an
abstract interface for writing to &ldquo;streams&rdquo;. Streams represent
buffered input and output. Stdin, stdout, and stderr represent
represent streams that are familiar to most programmers. The
streams package was designed to make it easy to add new kinds of
streams.</p><p>In addition to the standard I/O streams, one can open file
streams and text streams (that is, streams over character strings).
There is also a set of abstractions for unbuffered I/O. In addition
to the File type, there are Terminal and Pipe. The Fmt interface
provides a type-safe version of C's printf. A big source of errors
in C programs is passing one kind of data into a printf, but trying
to format it as a different kind of data. The Fmt interface was
designed to have the flexibility of printf, but without introducing
its problems.</p><p>Libm3 also defines a simple set of &ldquo;container&rdquo; types as
generic interfaces. The basic container types include tables,
lists, and sequences. A table is an associatively indexed array.
The list type is the familiar &ldquo;lisp&rdquo; style list. A sequence is an
integer (CARDINAL, actually) addressed array which can grow in
size.</p><p>Finally, Libm3 provides a simple persistence mechanism called
Pickles. Writing code to convert complex data structures to and
from some disk format is tedious and error prone. Many programmers
don't do it unless they absolutely have to. With the Pickle
package, you no longer need to write this kind of code. Since the
runtime knows the layout of every object in memory, it can use this
information to walk a set of structures and read them from or write
them to a stream. The programmer does not have to write
object-specific code for writing an object to a stream, although he
or she can if a better representation is known. For example, the
programmer of a hash table may choose to write out individual
entries if the table is below a certain size.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d2c0"></a>Trestle and VBTKit</h2></div></div><p>Most user interfaces (UI) are a spaghetti of event handlers,
timers, and signals. This is because they need to deal with user
input coming in at arbitrary times, they need to deal with
refreshing the screen, and they have to make sure that long running
operations don't cause the application's windows to freeze up. All
of these constraints make developing user interfaces in traditional
languages and libraries very difficult.</p><p>The SRC Modula-3 implementation provides a UI library known
as Trestle. The notable thing about Trestle is that it is highly
concurrent. It was written to make extensive use of threads and to
be used in a multithreaded environment.</p><p>This simplifies the development of user interfaces
considerably, since you don't have deal with the event loop any
more. An event loop is essentially &ldquo;poor man's multithreading&rdquo;.
Since the language and libraries support first-class threads, these
can be used instead. If the action associated with a button may
take a long time, the action can merely fork off a thread to handle
the bulk of the action. This thread can make arbitrary calls into
Trestle to update the screen with new results. Trestle protects
itself through judicious use of locks.</p><p>Trestle provides two sorts of objects: graphics objects such
as paths and regions, and a base set of user-interface objects.
These user-interface objects are known as &ldquo;VBT&rdquo;s. These play the
same role in Trestle as the X intrinsics play in the world of the X
toolkit. They define how screen-space is allocated among different
&ldquo;widgets&rdquo;. Trestle provides a simple set of buttons and menus in
its set of base UI items.</p><p>VBTKit is a higher-level toolkit built on top of Trestle.
VBTKit provides a much wider array of UI object kinds. It also
provides a Motif-like 3-D &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; (on color displays). The
same interface can be used on monochrome displays without change,
but without the appropriate visual appearance. VBTKit provides the
usual complement of scrollbars, buttons, menu items, numeric I/O
objects, and the like.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d528"></a>FormsVBT and FormsEdit</h2></div></div><p>FormsVBT is a User Interface Management System (UIMS)
structured as a library and is built on top of VBTKit. FormsVBT
provides a simple language for describing the layout of a user
interface and an event interpreter for that language. The layout
language follows a &ldquo;boxes and glue&rdquo; model. Boxes hold some set of
UI objects. A VBox arranges those objects in a vertical display,
while an HBox arranges them in a horizontal display. Glue is used
to force a certain amount of space between items in a visual
display. As you might expect, boxes can be nested
arbitrarily.</p><p>The FormsVBT library allows you to specify callbacks to
handle input. The FormsVBT specification that you write specifies
the &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; of your user interface; the event handlers that you
write provide the &ldquo;semantics&rdquo;.</p><p>FormsEdit is a simple UI creation tool built on top of
FormsVBT. It reads and displays graphically, and in source text
form, a UI specification written in the FormsVBT language. It also
allows for interactive modification of the source.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d6e0"></a><b  >m3tk</b></h2></div></div><p>There are times when you just need to develop some
language-specific tools for a project. The problem is that very few
language implementations give you any support in doing this. Many
times, all you have is a public domain YACC grammar that you have
to modify and then build from there. This is where m3 tk comes in.
It provides a complete toolkit for parsing M3 source files; and
generating and manipulating abstract syntax tree representations of
M3 sources. Thus a M3 specific tool can be built with relative
ease. In fact, the Network Objects (see below) stub generator was
built using it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe4d840"></a>Network Oblects</h2></div></div><p>Distributed systems are quickly becoming commonplace in the
'90s. Most languages provide little or no support for distributed
programming. Most distributed applications are still built directly
on top of sockets or use libraries that provide a simple stream or
RPC interface. These libraries are poorly integrated into the
language and introduce a severe impediment between the language and
the distributed system.</p><p>Network Objects is a facility in the SRC implementation of
Modula-3 that allows Modula-3 objects to be exported across address
spaces and machines. With Network Objects, a program can't tell if
the object it is operating on is one that it created in its own
address space or was one that was created and exists in another
address space. This provides a very powerful mechanism for
developing distributed applications.</p><p>To turn an object type into a network object, that object
must inherit (either directly or indirectly) from the type
NetObj.T. The object cannot contain any data fields. The interface
containing the declaration is then run through a tool called a stub
compiler. This generates all the coding necessary to handle network
interactions. That's all that is required to allow an object to be
passed around the network. Pretty simple. Below is an example of a
network object. It defines an interface called &ldquo;File&rdquo; that defines
the operations on a file, and an implementation of that
interface.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INTERFACE File;
TYPE T = NetObj.T OBJECT
METHODS
getChar(): CHARACTER;
putChar(c: CHARACTER);
END;
END File;
INTERFACE FileServer;
IMPORT File;
TYPE T = NetObj.T OBJECT
METHODS
create(name: Text): File.T
open(name: Text): File.T
END;
END FileServer;
</pre><p>The above code defines two types: <b  >File.T</b>,
which is an object with two methods to get and put a single
character; and <b  >FileServer.T</b>, an object which
manages file objects. A server someplace defines a concrete
implementation of these abstract types.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MODULE FileServerImpl;
IMPORT File, FileServer;
TYPE FileImpl = File.T
...state for a file...
OVERRIDES
getChar := GetChar;
putChar := PutChar;
END;
TYPE FileServerImpl = FileServer.T OBJECT
...state for a file server...
OVERRIDES
create := Create;
open := 0pen;
END;
VAR
fileServer := NEW(FileServerImpl);
BEGIN
NetObj.Export("FileServer",
END;
MODULE FileServerClient;
IMPORT File, FileServer;
VAR
fileServer := NetObj.Import("FileServer file");
file := fileServer.Create("someFile");
BEGIN
file.putChar('a');
END FileServerClient;
</pre><p>In the above code, <b  >FileServerImpl</b> creates
an instance of a file server and puts it into a name server. (The
<b  >NetObj.Export</b> call does this.) The module
<b  >FileServerClient</b> (which would be running in a
different address space or machine) imports the file server
implementation. This gives a valid Modula-3 object back to the
client. From that point on, the client invokes methods on it as if
it were local. It then creates a File object which it begins adding
characters to.</p><p>If you have done any development with SunRPC or DCE, you will
immediately appreciate how much simpler this is than programming on
top of either of these systems. Network Objects is similar in scope
to these systems, but is tightly integrated into the programming
model instead of being a poorly integrated adjunct.</p><p>Two interesting systems have been built on top of network
objects. The first is Obliq which is an object-oriented,
distributed scripting language. Obliq can call into existing
Modula-3 packages. You can also create Obliq objects and hand them
to other programs running on other machines. Obliq is similar in
scope to Telescript or TCL-DP (TCL with Distributed Programming
extensions). The other system is Visual Obliq, which can be thought
of as 'distributed Visual Basic for Modula-3'. It includes an
interactive, graphical application builder. Callbacks are handled
by Obliq scripts. This makes it a very powerful tools for
prototyping and building distributed applications. It can also be
used as the basis of interesting collaborative applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe44650"></a>Some Personal Experiences with Modula-3</h2></div></div><p>Our group has been using Modula-3 for about six months now,
although I have been involved with it since 1989 or so. Our group
consists of experienced C/C++ programmers. Two of have been
involved with C++ since version 1.2 and two of us worked on the
implementation of a C/C++ programming environment.</p><p>Our experience with Modula-3 has been completely positive.
The group members feel that the language, libraries, and supporting
tools have made us far more productive than we were when using C++.
The libraries are of higher quality and have better documentation
than many commercially available libraries. To accomplish a given
task, we write considerably less code than we used to and we
believe the code is of higher quality. We attribute this to two
things. The first is that the language is clean and simple; far
less mental effort is required to understand how to accomplish
something. The second contributing factor is much heavier use of
libraries. Instead of writing some piece of functionality, we first
see if the standard libraries provide it or something close to it.
Most of the time we find something close enough that we can take it
as a starting point.</p><p>On a more personal level, I have rarely seen a language,
tools, and set of libraries that so neatly combined simplicity,
elegance, and power.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd54580.0xe44808"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Modula-3 and the implementation from SRC provides an
excellent basis for developing Linux applications. It is a system
designed to meet the programming challenges of the '90s. The
language is clean, simple, and powerful. The provided libraries are
almost unequalled. The support for distributed programming is among
the best available.</p><p>One way to think of Modula-3 and the SRC implementation is
bringing a &ldquo;NeXTStep-like&rdquo; environment to Linux. They both start
with a simple object-oriented language (though M3 is both safer and
more powerful) and build useful and sophisticated libraries on top
of it. Of course, Modula-3 has the advantage of being freely
available and running on Linux!</p></div></div>
