Can KDE bring order from chaos?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x18c6250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When you build a house, you cannot start with the paint, fancy windows
and doorbell. Instead, you spend a lot of time digging in
the ground, disturbing the neighbors and making little visible progress
while you lay the foundation. It has been much the same with Nepomuk,
the Semantic Desktop technology of the KDE platform. Work has been going
on for a long time beneath the surface, causing occasional
disruption&mdash;such as file indexing slowing down the rest of your
desktop&mdash;with
little visible progress. However, the foundations now are solid, the
main structures are in place, and KDE's developers are adding features
that make Nepomuk useful for you, right now.
</p><p>
So, what can Nepomuk actually do for you?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x18c6460"></a>
Stop Searching, Start Finding</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing Nepomuk offers is file searching integrated into
your KDE applications. If your distribution has enabled Nepomuk, files
also can be tagged and rated from KDE's Dolphin file manager. You can
search for files simply by typing a query into Dolphin's search box,
which brings up results and a panel of basic options that make it easy
to refine the search. These enable you to limit searching to the current
folder and let you choose whether to search everything, text documents
(including OpenDocument texts and PDFs), images or filenames. When you have
identified the files you want, you can use the Save button to add the
search query to your Places panel on the left of the Dolphin window,
making the search available in the future via a single click. The saved search
also is available in the file chooser dialog of all KDE applications.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f1.large.jpg"><img src="10911f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Places sidebar.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x18c6720"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is This Thing Called Nepomuk?</b></p><p>
Nepomuk (also known as the Networked Environment for Personalized,
Ontology-based Management of Unified Knowledge) began as a research project
funded by the European Union to explore better ways of
managing, understanding and sharing desktop information. It attracted
participation from corporations, such as IBM and Linux vendor Mandriva, in
addition to
involvement from the National University of Ireland.
</p><p>
The initial project ran from 2006 to 2008, during which time a reference
implementation was written in Java. Mandriva and KDE have since worked
on integrating the ideas into KDE software, retaining the name Nepomuk.
</p><p>
Practical use of the technology required a high-performance file indexer
and query database. Initially, Nepomuk's own Java-based Sesame
query framework was used in the KDE implementation, but its reliance on Java
led to packaging problems for some distributions, and KDE switched
to Virtuoso in 2009. No longer held back by these technical constraints,
the main barriers to making greater use of Nepomuk in KDE software have
been removed.
</p></div><p>
You can access additional search options in Dolphin 1.5 (part of KDE
software compilation 4.5) by clicking the green + button. These provide
filtering based on file modification date, size, tags or rating. You can
continue to add and combine additional filters until you have isolated
the exact files you want&mdash;for example, by limiting the search to files
with a particular tag that have not been modified since a particular
date. You also can use the filters directly without any search terms.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f2.large.jpg"><img src="10911f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Dolphin 1.5 lets you combine filters
to narrow your search.
</p></div></div><p>
When Nepomuk first came to KDE software, it lacked a good graphical
search interface to expose its capabilities. Nepomuk always has offered
the ability to construct complex search queries using a query language,
such as SPARQL. You could, and still can, enter queries in this way
using Dolphin. Click on the breadcrumbs above the search results to
access Dolphin's editable location bar, view the query that was used
to generate the results and edit it directly. However, many users do
not have an intimate knowledge of the query language constructs and
would consider such an approach better suited to the command line than a
graphical file manager. The search interface in Dolphin 1.5 graphically
exposed many of Nepomuk's search capabilities for the first time.
</p><p>
Peter Penz, Dolphin's lead developer, still sees problems with the search
interface in Dolphin 1.5: &ldquo;It just takes way too many clicks to specify
a query.&rdquo; KDE developers, including Peter and Mandriva's Sebastian
Tr&uuml;g have been grappling with the problem of making a good graphical
interface that exposes the power of Nepomuk searches in a more convenient
manner. In 2009, Alessandro Sivieri began work on &ldquo;faceted
browsing&rdquo;,
an approach to the problem that provides panels of search filters in the
file manager sidebar, resulting in his Sembrowser prototype (see Resources).
Now,
these ideas have come together to provide a faceted browsing sidebar in
Dolphin 1.6 (part of KDE software compilation 4.6) that appears when
you start a search and makes additional filters available with single
clicks. Faceted browsing also will be integrated into the KDE platform,
making it available for other KDE applications to use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f3.large.jpg"><img src="10911f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Faceted browsing makes it easier
to combine filters in Dolphin 1.6.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x18c6f60"></a>
To Index or Not to Index?</h2></div></div><p>
Nepomuk's text searches rely on your computer having an index of files
and their contents. This is created by the Strigi indexer, which claims
to be the &ldquo;fastest and smallest desktop searching program&rdquo;. That
may be true, but crawling and interpreting files always is going to be
a resource-intensive task. KDE mitigates this by indexing files
only when the processor load is otherwise low and suspending indexing when
you switch to battery power. You also can suspend (or resume) indexing
on demand using Nepomuk's system tray icon, which is visible whenever
the indexing service is active. To suspend the indexer manually, just
right-click on the tray icon and check Suspend File Indexing. In my
experience, it is much more likely that you will find the indexer has
been suspended automatically at times when you would not mind having it
running than you will need to suspend it manually.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10911f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. File indexing can be suspended with
a couple clicks.
</p></div></div><p>
To gain full control over indexing, simply visit the Desktop Search
page in KDE's System Settings configuration utility. Alternatively,
you can access the configuration options directly from the right-click
menu of the Nepomuk system tray icon. You have the choice of whether to
enable Nepomuk and the Strigi file indexer at all, and you can specify which
folders should be indexed. You also can exclude certain file types,
such as backup files and partial downloads, and even set a limit on the
memory used by the search database.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f5.large.jpg"><img src="10911f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. KDE System Settings gives you fine control
over file indexing.
</p></div></div><p>
Once the file indexer has collected data for all of your files, it has
to be able to search the data quickly and efficiently. This was a major
problem facing Nepomuk when it first was included in KDE software, as the
available databases either lacked performance, features or both. However,
since the release of KDE software compilation 4.4 in February 2010,
Nepomuk has used the Virtuoso database, and as Peter puts it, &ldquo;Performance
problems are nearly gone.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Still, it makes sense not to index everything. After all, you probably
won't often need to find one of the thousands of shared library
or application files on your computer, and including them would waste
resources. However, you occasionally might need to find one of those
files. Before Dolphin 1.6, terms entered in Dolphin's search bar 
queried only the Nepomuk database, and it was necessary to use the separate
KFind interface to search non-indexed files. This meant you had to
know whether the file you were looking for was in an indexed location
before deciding which search interface to use. In Dolphin 1.6, both
search types are integrated in a single search box, so that the Nepomuk
database is used for directories that have been indexed by Strigi, and
KFind is used for other locations. In this way, you still get search
results when you search in a folder that is excluded from indexing,
it just takes a little longer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x18c7590"></a>
You Are Still Smarter than Your PC</h2></div></div><p>
Fast and customizable desktop search is the most visible and,
at present, probably the most-used benefit provided by Nepomuk in
a KDE workspace. However, the Nepomuk developers have much higher
ambitions. Although computers are very good at indexing files, they are
very bad at understanding the relationships between them.
</p><p>
Making meaningful relationships between files remains one of the major
challenges for Nepomuk. If your friend Alice is getting married and you
need to find the map you were sent that shows the wedding venue's location, 
you might look for e-mail messages from both her and
her future husband, Bob. You instinctively would realize that information
related to Alice may be found in a Web page or communication from Bob,
because you understand their relationship. However, your computer would
not give any special priority to files that had come from Bob.
</p><p>
One way of making your computer act a little smarter is to tag your
files. This works in a similar way to how you tag music files, so 
your media player can present you with albums, artists and even
genres to browse, instead of forcing you to navigate through directory
structures. You can tag any kind of file simply by clicking on the Tags
section of Dolphin's Information panel. This brings up a dialog to apply
existing tags or create new ones. KDE image viewer Gwenview also enables
you to use and edit the same tags and to browse images by tag rather than
path. If you received a map from Bob relating to his wedding to your
friend Alice, you could tag it with terms such as &ldquo;Bob&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Alice&rdquo;,
&ldquo;wedding&rdquo; and &ldquo;map&rdquo; and then easily find it using Dolphin's search box.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f6.large.jpg"><img src="10911f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Gwenview image viewer makes it
easy to tag your photos.
</p></div></div><p>
There are other possibilities for tagging beyond making search more
powerful. If you are working on a number of projects and some of your
files are relevant to more than one of those projects, you can apply
tags for each project, filter based on those tags in Dolphin, and then
save that search as a &ldquo;Place&rdquo;. You then can access the files
relevant to a given project in any KDE application quickly, without needing to
copy any of the files into project-specific folders or set up links.
</p><p>
Of course, tagging your files manually could take a lot of time, and
it is not information you would want to lose when you buy a new
computer or re-install your operating system. With KDE platform 4.6,
Nepomuk provides the ability to back up and transfer this human-generated
metadata so you can always take it with you.
</p><p>
You also can use tagging and saved Nepomuk searches to have a selection
of relevant files available right on your desktop when you log in. To do
this, all you need to do is create a Folder View Plasma widget in your
KDE workspace, and then use its configuration dialog either to enter a
search query directly or select a search you already saved as a
Place. For example, you could have folder views containing the files
for each of the main projects you are working on. You even could restrict
the initial view to only the most important files by rating them with
five stars and filtering the results by rating.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f7.large.jpg"><img src="10911f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can use saved Nepomuk searches to
put relevant files on your desktop.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x1cc0020"></a>
It's Good to Share</h2></div></div><p>
Tagging is, of course, in itself, nothing new. Media players and
photo management applications have been using tags for years to enable
convenient views of files that are freed from a single, rigid directory
structure. However, these systems have been largely incompatible. You
can read basic tags embedded in Vorbis music files in KDE's Amarok and
in other music players, but you cannot easily transfer other metadata,
such as ratings or playcounts, between music players. Neither do tags
applied to images in KDE's photo management application, digiKam, appear
in Dolphin or Gwenview. For some file types, it is not possible to embed
metadata at all.
</p><p>
As more applications make use of tagging to simplify organization and
retrieval of content, there is a danger of redundancy with the same
data being collected and stored multiple times, so sharing storage and
resources makes sense. To work together, applications not only
need to have a way of sharing metadata but also a way of understanding
it. One
of the main jobs of the Nepomuk Project is to define these common ways
of representing metadata of differing types. E-mail messages that came from your
friend Alice are different from e-mail messages that mention her, and you want your
computer to understand that difference.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10911f8.large.jpg"><img src="10911f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Bangarang lets you browse using information
from Nepomuk.
</p></div></div><p>
Within the world of KDE software, the most visible users of Nepomuk are
the Dolphin file manager, Gwenview image viewer and the Bangarang media
player. The last integrates browsing of media by type (movies, TV shows,
short clips), rating, playcount and date of last play. Although use of
Nepomuk in KDE applications is limited at present, Peter is optimistic
about the future take up of Nepomuk due to improvements in the ease of
accessing the technology: &ldquo;searching and filtering&mdash;it gets easier and
easier from applications in each release&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x1cc03e8"></a>
Be Lazy</h2></div></div><p>
If going through all of your files and manually adding tags and ratings
is not your idea of fun, good news is coming for you.
</p><p>
Nepomuk developers are working on automatically identifying the files
you use most often and prioritizing those in search results. File use 
also can be linked to Plasma Activities, so that you could be presented with
different files depending whether you were using your computer for work
or play. Nepomuk also is able to keep track of the source of files you
find on-line, recording the original file location. This not only helps
you find images you have downloaded from your friend's on-line photo
album, but also could work the other way around, enabling you to find
the Web site where you downloaded a favorite desktop background.
</p><p>
KDE's personal information and communication suite, Kontact, is being
ported to a new storage system, Akonadi (see Resources). This will make it easier
to maintain semantic information on items that arrive in messages&mdash;for
example, by linking file attachments with the person who sent them&mdash;so that you can find an image your friend sent you two weeks ago.
</p><p>
KDE and Mandriva developers also are working on integrating technologies
from Scribo (Semi-automatic and Collaborative Retrieval of Information
Based on Ontologies). This aims to automate the extraction of
meaningful metadata from files. For example, it should be possible to
determine keywords and topics from text-based documents to suggest tags
or even apply them automatically. Scribo also has the ability to extract
text from images, so that a photograph including a road sign bearing
the word &ldquo;Paris&rdquo; might be found in a search for
&ldquo;Paris&rdquo; without the need
for manual tagging. Capabilities like this are not yet integrated into
the KDE platform, but experimental code has been included in the KDE
source repositories.
</p><p>
If you are curious about possible future directions of Nepomuk, Mandriva
Linux 2010 includes some experimental features. It has special versions
of KDE's Konqueror Web browser and KMail messaging program that enable
tagging of Web pages and e-mail so they can be retrieved in searches. It
also has the ability to offer tag autocompletion&mdash;for example, suggesting
the tag &ldquo;John Smith&rdquo; from your address book when you begin to type the
word &ldquo;John&rdquo; as a new tag.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ce580.0x1cc0808"></a>
This Is Just the Beginning</h2></div></div><p>
It would be wrong to describe Nepomuk as feature-complete or without
any flaws. Its developers see much greater potential than that currently
realized in KDE software. However, enabling Nepomuk and Strigi indexing
in your KDE workspace today gives you unobtrusive, fast and flexible
desktop search to find your files easily. You also can begin to organize
your files using tags rather than being limited to rigid directory
structures, and you can save search queries as Places for easy access
from any KDE application. You even can have sets of your most important
files waiting for you when you log in. The Nepomuk house is not complete,
but the foundations are strong, and it is now safe to go in and take a
good look around. If you do so, you may discover you like what you find.
