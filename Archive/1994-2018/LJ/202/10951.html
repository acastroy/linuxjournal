<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Hey, Kyle, what do you think of tablets?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Well, I think they are fine for
storing commandments, but for computing, I
think they are a bit limiting. I take it you probably think they are great.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I don't think they're great, but they certainly have come a long
way. In the right setting, I can see how they'd be very useful. I'm thinking
about getting one myself.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> See, when I use a computer, I tend to type a lot. I'm pretty particular
about getting tactile feedback in my keyboards whether it's for a desktop
(Model M thank you) or a laptop. Typing on a flat surface with no feedback just
seems like a step backward.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I remember, you're all about the battleship keyboard. I know that having
your keyboard survive a zombie insurrection is a major selling point for you.
However, there's more to a tablet than just typing. Having an instant-on
Web browser and mail client just kicking around would be very handy.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> You mean like a laptop that can suspend to RAM? Or a Netbook?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I have yet to see any laptop that's
truly instant-on, even when suspended
to RAM. They always take a few seconds to get on their feet. And even then,
the form factor is different. A laptop or Netbook is the tool of choice for
content creation, but for content consumption, I think a tablet might be the
way to go.
I know more often than not I'll reach for my iPhone if I need to check
mail real quick. It's just faster and more convenient.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> See, that's just the point, I think the tablet has long been a
solution in search of a problem. Now it has to compete with a smartphone for
portable, underpowered computing, a Netbook for inexpensive portable computing,
and a laptop or desktop for full-featured computing. Having a large fruit-named
company create one (and new companies throw cell-phone software on their
tablets) doesn't change that. I had a hybrid laptop that could rotate
into tablet mode, and I think I used it maybe a handful of times, and even
then,
it was just as a novelty e-book reader.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I remember, but that laptop wasn't exactly a powerhouse either. And if I
recall, it was running stock Ubuntu, which is not a portable-optimized OS like Android
or iOS. I think your definition of computing is different from that of a lot of folks,
Kyle. As a system administrator and writer, your use case depends on having
multiple windows, a full-size keyboard, and the storage and horsepower of a
conventional laptop. However, as iPad sales prove, there's a huge segment of
the population who just wants to surf using tablets and play
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Unless you are wearing some interesting jeans, a tablet isn't going to be
any more portable than any other similarly underpowered Netbook, but you'll pay
a premium for the fingerprint-smeared touchscreen and the lack of a keyboard. I
think even surfing suffers on a tablet. However hyperlinked the Web might be,
these days, people keep talking about everyone &ldquo;contributing to the
conversation&rdquo; and other Web 2.0 terms. It's hard to do that just by touching
and dragging on a screen.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Actually, SCOTTEVEST makes a vest
that can hold an iPad in an internal
pocket like a holster, but that's a little much even for me. Considering
how I'd use a
tablet, I wouldn't miss the keyboard. It wouldn't be my primary computing
device, nor would it be what I reached for if I needed to do heavy work.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> And no matter how sophisticated your touchscreen keyboard is, it's still
a keyboard on a flat surface with no tactile feedback. Plus, you lose a good
portion of that tablet screen for it. I'd still love to see a picture of all of
your active computing gear stacked on top of each other in size order. I think
your iPad would fit somewhere on top of your small laptop but underneath your
Netbook, Nokia pocket tablets and smartphones.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I think
you can do more on a tablet than you realize. I've taken two
trips with nothing but my iPhone and I actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>survived</em></span> just fine. A tablet
would be nice to take on those trips for the great battery life and larger
screen. For me, I think it fits between a laptop and iPhone nicely. You keep
asking for pics of my computers. It's like you're just interested in me for my
system porn. I HAVE A MIND TOO.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I've taken a number of trips myself
with just an N900, and the only things
I've missed were a full-size keyboard and larger screen. Anything much
larger than that, and you lose the real benefit of a portable smartphone.
Basically, to me, anywhere you can take a tablet, you can take either a Netbook
or a laptop. Although touchscreen interfaces are all the rage now, I still think
they are really limited compared to a lot of the traditional input methods. In
my mind, if you truly do want a tablet, the smart move is to invest in a
convertible model, so you at least can get a proper hardware keyboard when you
need one.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That's where a tablet fits in. I bring my Nook now on trips as a book,
and it works great. If that device had a faster CPU, faster screen refresh and
the ability to do a little more, I would carry it around constantly. I don't
need it to do everything; I just need it to do 90% of everything. You can pair
a Bluetooth keyboard to a tablet, and then you've got your proper hardware
keyboard.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> For three hours until the battery
dies, at least....
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Three hours? Now you're resorting to
hyperbole. The Galaxy Tab is good for seven,
and the iPad is good for ten, according to specs and reviews I've seen. I
know my Bluetooth keyboard batteries last a lot longer than either of those.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> The bottom line for me is that for completely portable (and touchscreen)
computing, I have an N900 with a physical keyboard. For full-featured
computing,
I have a rather portable laptop. To me, and I imagine to most of the
population, a tablet is nothing more than the third computer no one really
needs.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I think the market proves your opinion to be wrong, Kyle. Apple sold 4.2
million iPads in the last quarter&mdash;4.2 <span   class="emphasis"><em>million</em></span>. There's a market for tablets
and a use case for them. It may not be something <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> want, but the public's
definitely interested, and so am I. I'm going to see what the next generation
of iPad and Android tablets brings to the table before I pull the trigger on a
purchase, but I definitely can see myself using one for light-duty
computing.
