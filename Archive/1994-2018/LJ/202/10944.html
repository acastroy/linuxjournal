The open market is as big as its many fragments.

During Apple's Q4 2010 earnings call with analysts, Steve Jobs did
a typically masterful job of re-clothing an old argument in fresh
duds. The old argument was open vs. closed. The new one was integrated
vs. fragmented. Time will tell if the clothes will fit. Meanwhile,
I'd like to devote this space to helping make sure they don't.
So, here's what Steve said, with corrective replies. From a transcript
of the call, in tech.Fortune.com (<a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/18/what-steve-jobs-said-about-google" target="_self">tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/18/what-steve-jobs-said-about-google</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as
closed, we find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference
between our two approaches. The first thing most of us think about
when we hear the word open is Windows, which is available on a variety
of devices. Unlike Windows, however, where most PCs have the same user
interface and run the same app, Android is very fragmented. Many Android
OEMs, including the two largest, HTC and Motorola, install proprietary
user interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android
experience. The users will have to figure it all out. Compare this with
iPhone, where every handset works the same.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Calling Windows &ldquo;open&rdquo; is weird&mdash;like the pot calling the kettle white.
Windows-based boxes are also no less fragmented than Android phones. Right
here, I've got a Lenovo ThinkPad with proprietary UI features, such as
the red pointstick and the ThinkVantage button. And, not every iPhone
handset works the same. Old models either don't run or work well with
the latest OS. Here's Steve again:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Twitter client, Twitter Deck, recently launched their app for
Android. They reported that they had to contend with more than 100
different versions of Android software on 244 different handsets. The
multiple hardware and software iterations present developers with a
daunting challenge. Many Android apps work only on selected Android
handsets running selected Android versions. And this is for handsets that
have been shipped less than 12 months ago. Compare this with iPhone,
where there are two versions of the software, the current and the most
recent predecessor to test against.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Here's what TweetDeck (Steve got the name wrong) actually said in its
blogged report (<a href="http://blog.tweetdeck.com/android-ecosystem" target="_self">blog.tweetdeck.com/android-ecosystem</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
To date, we've had 36,427 active beta testers, and below you can see the
massive variety of phones and Android OS versions everyone is running. We
were really shocked to see the number of custom roms, crazy phones and
the general level of customization/hackalicious nature of Android. From our
perspective, it's pretty cool to have our app work on such a wide variety
of devices and Android OS variations.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So TweetDeck has no problem with &ldquo;fragmentation&rdquo;. In fact,
TweetDeck thinks
it's cool. Also, what Steve's saying with his &ldquo;two versions&rdquo; point is
that only the last two iPhone models are supported. Earlier ones are
obsolete. In fact, they have to be, if you're keeping up with the latest
downloads of the OS and its mother ship, iTunes.
</p><p>
Now to the matter of smoke-blowing:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In reality, we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen
to try to hide the real issue, which is, what's best for the customer,
fragmented versus integrated. We think Android is very, very fragmented
and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple's
provides the integrated model so that the user isn't forced to be
the systems integrator.
</p><p>
...And we also think our developers can be more innovative if they can
target a singular platform rather than a hundred variants. They can put
their time into innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds
of different handsets.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
After hearing this, I contacted a friend who does lots of Android (and
Linux) development. His first response:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
For a phone OS, it's as open as they come, by a huge margin. Source code
is readily available for free download by anybody. Having a complete
copy of the source code makes development easier. But in general, you
can do anything you want on Android.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Then he adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Here's where Steve's right: anybody can build their own Android device
based on the resources available on-line. If you use Qualcomm chips,
Qualcomm will have already written the kernel drivers for you and gotten
it all integrated. Other chip vendors probably do the same thing. But
if you want your device to work with the DRM-protected apps on the
Android market, you have to have your device locked down security-wise
and vetted by Google. Sometimes vendors push an over-the-air upgrade and
forget to vet the new OS with Google first. Then all of a sudden paid
apps stop working. Still, with Android you can generate a single binary
that runs everywhere. Yes, there are version issues. Develop for 2.1,
then 1.5 phones can't use it. That's why I always develop my apps on
the most primitive version of the OS that will run them. The development
environment (Eclipse) lets you do that. You can run any version of the
OS under the emulator. And every app can specify a version of the OS it
was intended for, plus a range of OS versions that it supports.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In the argument about arguments, it's easy to miss the Big Thing that's
happening here: phones are becoming the new PCs, and there are many
choices of ways to develop for them&mdash;and Android (and, therefore,
Linux) is one of the top two. Apple deserves credit for cracking open
the market with a highly vertical approach. But Apple's market is a
closed silo. Android's market is wide open. There's no limit on how big
it can be.
