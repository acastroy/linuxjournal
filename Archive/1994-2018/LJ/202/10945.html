HTML5 gives Web applications new communication features.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x239f358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I took an initial look at HTML5, the new standard for
HTML that increasingly is supported by popular browsers. HTML5
includes a large number of different technologies and solutions, and
it's being rolled out in a piecemeal fashion. Some parts of HTML,
such as the abbreviated DOCTYPE declaration at the top of a
document, can be used already. Other parts, such as new elements for
HTML forms, are not quite ready yet for mainstream use, unless
you are willing to use JavaScript to handle elements in browsers that
lack support for those features.
</p><p>
For me, the improved form tags and expanded semantic markup for
sections, headers and the like are both important and useful
advances. But in many ways, I believe some of the most important
improvements are a bit harder to understand and will take longer to
catch on. These are improvements in how different pages may
communicate with one another within the same browser or how the Web
browser may communicate with outside resources.
</p><p>
To date, it has been difficult, if not impossible, for a program
running in the browser (that is, with JavaScript) to create a mashup
between two data sources or interact with another open window.
This was because of a combination of historical, practical and
security concerns, all of which were understandable. But today, we
want our browsers to do more. Indeed, most modern applications are
being developed for the browser, and if we can somehow push more
information and intelligence to the browser, we'll both reduce the
load on our servers and improve the responsiveness of the application.
</p><p>
A number of features in HTML5&mdash;and yes, some of these features
aren't really part of the HTML5 specification, but I'll pretend
they are for the purposes of this column&mdash;are designed to solve
precisely this problem. These features aren't meant to make it easier
to create Web pages, but rather Web applications. Specifically, I'm
talking about interpage communication, WebSockets and threads,
known as Web workers. Each of these topics probably deserves a
column to itself, so I admit that the examples I provide
here are meant to give you a taste of what's possible, rather than a
comprehensive tutorial or example. Nevertheless, I hope you'll
become excited about the possibilities raised here, and perhaps you'll
even think of new and interesting ways to make use of these features.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x239f618"></a>
Interpage Communication</h2></div></div><p>
The basic building block of the Web is the page, and more
specifically, the page of HTML. Sure, modern Web browsers can display
all sorts of different formats, but for all intents and purposes,
when you talk about a Web app, you're talking about one or more pages
of HTML. Nowadays, that page can be modified via JavaScript, using a
variety of different techniques that often are lumped together with
the Ajax name, regardless of how true or appropriate that is. Ajax
has complicated things somewhat, removing the one-to-one
correspondence that used to exist between HTTP requests and HTML
pages. Although this means the flow of our applications has become
more complicated, Ajax has made the Web a far more useful and
friendly platform for users, and even for developers.
</p><p>
For many years, Web browsers were one-page-per-window affairs. If you
wanted to browse three pages simultaneously, you needed to open
multiple windows. Modern browsers all support the use of tabs, with
some users (like me) abusing this feature quite a bit, opening dozens
of tabs each day and then taking my sweet time to read and close the
contents of each one. Given that all of these tabs (or windows) are
running within the same program, it should be possible for them to
communicate using a combination of JavaScript and HTML.
</p><p>
Perhaps this should be the case, but to date, it has not been
possible. That's due to privacy concerns. You didn't want one Web
page to be able to read from or write to another page without
permission, and there wasn't a standard that would provide such
permission. This is true not only in the case of two separate pages,
but also in the case of two iframes on the same page, which might want
to affect each other.
</p><p>
Now, if you're thinking you actually have been able to do this in
the past without any hoopla, you might be right. It's true that
an iframe can communicate with, and even modify, its parent window,
but only if the two pages have the same origin. HTML5 changes the
rules of the game by allowing pages to communicate with one another,
even if they have different origins.
</p><p>
This works as follows. The sending page invokes the
postMessage() method on the window or iframe that should receive the
message, along with the expected origin of the receiver. For example,
let's create a very simple HTML file that contains little more than an
iframe (Listing 1). For
now, ignore the JavaScript event handler that is defined there. I'll
get to that in a bit.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x239f930"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. atf.html, the Container HTML Page</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
   $(document).ready(function() {
   window.addEventListener('message', receiver, false);
   function receiver(e) {
       alert("origin = '" + e.origin + "'");
       alert("data = '" + e.data + "'");
           $("#message").val(e.data);
   };
   });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Page headline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="message"&gt;[No message yet]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id="my-iframe" src="iframe.html" /&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Inside this page is an iframe. Now, for demonstration
purposes, this iframe will have the same origin as the outer page.
But in many cases, the iframe will come from a completely different
origin. In HTML5, that doesn't matter at all. You can send a
message to whichever recipient you like. If you look at the
HTML source for iframe.html, you'll see how to accomplish this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).ready(function() {
$("#send-button").click(function() {
    window.parent.postMessage($("#text-to-send").val(), '*');
});
});
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I use jQuery to grab the button whose ID is
&ldquo;send-button&rdquo;. I then add an event handler to that button, indicating
that when it is clicked, it should invoke window.parent.postMessage,
sending the text contained inside the text field. I should note
that the postMessage() method can be called on any window or iframe,
and that it can send any text in its first parameter.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x239fd50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. iframe.html, the Contents of Which Are Loaded into an
iframe</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;iframe title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.js" /&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;iframe headline&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text to send: &lt;input type="text" id="text-to-send" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input id="send-button" type="button" value="Send it!" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
$(document).ready(function() {
   $("#send-button").click(function() {
       window.parent.postMessage($("#text-to-send").val(), '*');
   });
});
&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The second parameter indicates the origin of the recipient to whom
you're sending this message. In this case, I have indicated that the
recipient may have any origin by specifying a wild card. In production
environments, it's probably safe to assume you will want to
specify an origin. By stating the recipient's origin, there's a bit
of additional safety&mdash;the message will be sent only if the receiving window object's content
is from the stated origin.
</p><p>
On the receiver's end, the posted message arrives as an event, one
which the receiver can (and should!) examine before using. Going back
to atf.html, you will see how the receiver accepts a message in its
event handler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$(document).ready(function() {
window.addEventListener('message', receiver, false);
function receiver(e) {
    alert("origin = '" + e.origin + "'");
    alert("data = '" + e.data + "'");
        $("#message").text(e.data);
};
});
</pre>
</p><p>
The event handler for this page indicates that it's willing to accept
a message. Each message consists of two pieces, the message (the text string that the sender passed as a parameter to postMessage)
and the origin (the sender's origin). Note that the sender
cannot set its origin; this piece of information is handled by the
browser.
</p><p>
Because the origin information is passed along with the message, it's
possible for the receiver to filter out which origins it is willing to
accept. In other words, although it's possible a rogue site will
try to start posting to random windows that you might have open on
other sites, the only way such messages actually will arrive is
if the receivers are willing to accept them. I'm sure someone
with more of a black-hat mentality than mine will find ways to defeat
this security mechanism, but from what I can tell, it was thought
out very carefully and cleverly, and should avoid most mischief.
</p><p>
Now that it's possible for any window to send messages to any other
window, what can you do with it? The answer, of course, is that no one
knows. Off of the top of my head, I can imagine chat clients&mdash;or more
generally, using a single window on a Web browser as a communication
switchboard and clearinghouse&mdash;grabbing feeds and incoming messages
and putting them on the appropriate pages. Imagine if Facebook were
to have a single iframe that would handle its (very large!) number of
interactions with the server, and then handle all page updates through
that iframe, rather than on each individual window or tab.
</p><p>
I also can imagine the postMessage() method ushering in a new age of
multiwindow, desktop-like applications. Think of how many desktop
applications now use multiple windows&mdash;one for control, another for
each document and yet another for a &ldquo;palette&rdquo; of options. Now you
can do the same thing with a Web browser, with a native
message-passing interface.
</p><p>
Just what people will do with these capabilities is unknown, but I
predict we'll see a rash of new, rich, browser-based applications
that take advantage of them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x23a02d0"></a>
WebSockets</h2></div></div><p>
One of the greatest contributions of UCB (Berkeley) to the UNIX
operating system was the introduction of sockets. Sockets allowed
programmers to open a connection to another
computer easily and quickly. Once opened, the socket operated something like a
point-to-point file handle, allowing you to ignore the fact that data
in the socket was being transmitted through dozens or hundreds of
other computers. A large number of Internet services, from SMTP to
FTP to HTTP, use sockets. I personally have used them for nearly 20
years to implement everything from my undergraduate thesis, to Web
browsers and servers, to various Internet-enabled applications.
</p><p>
HTML5 brings socket-like connections to the browser, using a
technology called WebSockets. WebSockets are similar in principle
to UNIX sockets, in that you can open a connection to an arbitrary
other point on the Internet, and send and receive data reliably without
even considering the numerous hops or connections along the way.
</p><p>
Now, if you are an experienced Web developer, you might be
wondering what the big deal is. After all, Ajax calls allow you to
open HTTP connections and send and receive data. And xhr (the
XmlHttpRequest function) has been around for a few years, and it works
quite well. The difference is WebSockets will allow you to open
one or more connections to anywhere on the Internet, not just to
servers with the same origin as the current page. Moreover,
WebSockets use their own protocol that is admittedly quite similar to
HTTP, but it has a great deal less overhead. Finally, WebSockets
remain open as long as the sides agree to do so&mdash;as opposed to HTTP,
which is meant to be stateless and to be closed after a single
request-response transaction. For all these reasons, communication
using WebSockets generally is going to be far more efficient. A
number of articles describing WebSockets have done the math and show
just how much more efficient WebSockets are than HTTP&mdash;and the
difference is staggering.
</p><p>
Working with WebSockets is remarkably simple. You open a WebSocket
with some JavaScript code, often (presumably) fired either when a user
performs an action (such as pressing a button) or when a certain event
takes place (for example, a certain amount of time has elapsed). No matter
what, you open a new WebSocket by specifying the URI to which you want
to connect, starting with a protocol name (either ws or wss, for
unencrypted or encrypted, respectively), continuing with the hostname,
and then ending with a resource name.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x23a0538"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. ws.html</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;script src="jquery.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
   var weatherSocket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");

   $(document).ready(function() {


   weatherSocket.onopen = function(e) {
   alert("Opened weather socket");
   };

   weatherSocket.onmessage = function(e) {
   alert("Received a message: " + e.data);
   };

   weatherSocket.onclose = function(e) {
   alert("Closing the weather socket...");
   };

   });
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Page headline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebSockets!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt;

   while(weatherSocket.readyState == 0)
   {
   alert("socket state is " + weatherSocket.readyState);
   }

   alert("socket state is " + weatherSocket.readyState);

   weatherSocket.send("Hello from the client!");
   alert("socket state is " + weatherSocket.readyState);
   weatherSocket.close();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Once the WebSocket is open, you can attach callbacks to it, indicating
what should happen when the socket is opened, closed or receives a
message. (Each time the WebSocket receives data from the remote host,
it will invoke the &ldquo;onmessage&rdquo; callback function.)
</p><p>
For example, here's a simple WebSocket that retrieves data from a
hypothetical weather server:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var weatherSocket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080"); 
 &#8618;// Our own weather server
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can assign callbacks:

<pre     class="programlisting">
weatherSocket.onopen = function(e) {
alert("Opened weather socket");
};

weatherSocket.onmessage = function(e) {
alert("Received a message: " + e.data);
};

weatherSocket.onclose = function(e) {
alert("Closing the weather socket...");
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, you can send messages by invoking the send() method&mdash;yes,
the same method that you saw above, but without the second parameter
indicating the origin.
</p><p>
Notice that although you write directly to the WebSocket using send, you
don't read a result directly from it or via a return value to send().
Rather, you will get the data when it is sent to you, via the execution
of your method at weatherSocket.onmessage().
</p><p>
One piece is missing from this description, namely a server to
which the WebSocket connects. You cannot connect to just any old
server on the other end, and especially not to an HTTP server.
Fortunately, a growing number of packages (in various open-source
languages) can handle the server side of WebSockets. One such package
is the em-websocket gem for Ruby, based on the well-known
eventmachine gem. WebSocket server libraries already exist for
PHP and Python, as well as a number of other languages. Over time, I
expect to see a number of WebSocket-compatible servers
emerge.
</p><p>
How can you use WebSockets? As with interwindow communication, I
expect the best applications and ideas haven't been
developed yet. But once your Web browser can connect to any host on the
Internet using a specialized high-performance protocol, you can
imagine that the sky is the limit. Suddenly, Web-based chat servers no
longer need to use kludges or hacks in order to allow for real-time
chat. You can create mashups on the client, rather than the server.
Combined with the new geolocation facilities in HTML5, you can have a
map that updates your location in real time, using nothing more than
HTML and JavaScript. It does mean that on the server side, Web
applications now will require more than just installing Apache, but
that has been true for a while now, as applications have become more
sophisticated, so I don't think you need to worry about that too much.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a7580.0x23a0b68"></a>
Web Workers</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, another intriguing addition to HTML5 is the notion of Web
workers, which you can think of as the browser equivalent of threads.
Perhaps you have a complex task that needs to be handled in parallel
with rendering of a page or of downloading information from the
Internet. By splitting the work across two Web workers, you can take
advantage of today's modern, multiprocessor computers to get a faster
result. Because Web workers operate in the background, rather than on
the thread that handles displaying the page, the page should be more
responsive than if everything were in one thread.
</p><p>
Now, I must admit I generally have tried to avoid programming
with threads, because of the many problems that can crop up whenever
you have shared resources. Given that JavaScript was never designed
to work with threads, my first thought when I heard about Web workers
was how this possibly could work while keeping data safe and the
browser stable. The solution appears to be sound, although it's still
too early for me (and many others) to know for sure.
</p><p>
The idea is this. You launch a Web worker by creating a new Worker
object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var worker = new Worker("code.js");
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you hand the name of a file to a Web worker. You cannot
hand it a piece of code, either directly or by passing it a function
reference. Perhaps it eventually will be possible for a browser-based
application to create dynamically, and then store (using WebSockets?)
a file on the server, but the main purpose of this restriction is to
ensure that there is no chance for shared data among the various Web
workers, thus avoiding the chance for issues traditionally associated
with threads.
</p><p>
Indeed, Web workers operate almost as if they existed on different
computers, with no direct connections between them. Workers cannot
access the DOM, which means any elements on the page. Functions and
data in the main thread are not available to the Web workers, and vice
versa.
</p><p>
This raises the question of how the main thread and Web workers can
communicate. The answer probably won't surprise you. They use
postMessage(), the same mechanism for message passing that can be used
to send information from one window or tab to another, regardless of
origin.
</p><p>
I can foresee a number of uses for Web workers. First, they
will allow browser-based applications to handle more than one thing at
a time, ensuring that the main thread is used for rendering the UI and
interacting with the user. Second, it means you can start to
break problems apart, taking advantage of modern computer hardware
that can put different threads on different processors intelligently.
Finally, it means JavaScript now has the beginnings of a built-in
message-passing mechanism. And, although programs still must remain
inside a single browser, I have to assume at some point, it'll
be possible to open a Web worker not just on your local machine, but
on a remote one, as well.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Marc Andreessen, who wrote the original Mosaic browser and helped to
popularize the Web as a founder of Netscape, claimed years ago that
the browser is the new operating system. Even as Ajax and other
advanced Web technologies have advanced during the past few years, and
such amazing browser-based applications as Google Docs have emerged, I
still have been skeptical of whether Web-based applications ever
will truly rival their desktop counterparts. The addition of cross-window
communication, WebSockets and Web workers go a long way toward
convincing me that Andreessen's prediction has nearly come true.
</p><p>
HTML5 and its associated technologies include a wealth of new options
for developers. It will take some time to figure out how well these
work, how to get around the fact that not all browsers support them
and just how useful (or not) various features might be. If you are a
Web developer, I encourage you to study and work with these
technologies as soon as possible. I already have changed the
architecture of some of my applications as a result, and I wouldn't be
surprised if that happens to you too.

Resources</b></p><p>
The best book I've read on the subject, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dive Into
HTML5</em></span>, isn't even a proper book
at the time of this writing, but rather a free on-line resource written by Mark
Pilgrim (<a href="http://diveintohtml5.org" target="_self">diveintohtml5.org</a>). If you are familiar with Pilgrim's previous work, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dive Into Python</em></span>, you know his writing is excellent.
Not surprisingly, this was the first resource to which I turned to
bone up on HTML5, and it continues to be my favorite combination of
tutorial and reference.
</p><p>
However, Pilgrim's book says very little on the subjects I've
mentioned in this month's column. For excellent tutorials on these
subjects, I recommend <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro HTML5 Programming</em></span> written by Peter
Lubbers, Brian Albers and Frank Salim. This last book also is aimed
at beginners. Although I think other books are better than this one
in other areas, it really shines in the cases I mentioned this month.
</p><p>
Finally, take a look at <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com" target="_self">www.html5rocks.com</a>, a Google-sponsored
site that describes various HTML5-related technologies, including
documentation and code examples.
