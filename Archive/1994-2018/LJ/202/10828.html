Kexi is an integrated data management application and forms part of the
KOffice suite. It can be used for creating database schemas, inserting
data, performing queries, processing data and producing reports.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0xf12250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This article takes new users through a range of concepts in Kexi,
the KOffice database management program. The features available in Kexi
range from simple table and query creation to more-advanced reporting
and scripting. Kexi recently was released as part of KOffice 2.2. This
article is aimed at new users and existing users of Kexi 1.6 as a 
demonstration of how useful Kexi can be.
</p><p>
Kexi 2 has taken three years of development to get to this stage from Kexi
1.6, and it missed the releases of KOffice 2.0 and 2.1 due to the small
number of developers. Like many open-source programs, Kexi is developed
solely in developers' free time as a hobby. It is hoped
that this first release now is stable enough for use and that it will provide
something to build upon for future releases.
</p><p>
To be a useful guide, it's helpful to work on a real use case.
As the owner of the Kexi Facebook page (see Resources), I get weekly updates via
e-mail with various statistics. The aim of this article is to get this
data out of these e-mail messages and into a Kexi database to be able to perform
queries and reports to show trends over time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0xf124b8"></a>
The Raw Data</h2></div></div><p>
To get the data for the database, I exported a selection of e-mail messages
from KMail. This created a .mbox file, which basically is a text file
containing all the messages. It would have been possible to go
through each e-mail and enter the details into a table manually, but as I have a
few built up already, I want to gather the data automatically. This
provides a good challenge for writing a script within Kexi to do it
for me.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0xf125c0"></a>
Starting Off&mdash;Create a Database and Table</h2></div></div><p>
If Kexi is not included in your installation, see if it is available as an
update in your package manager. If not, you need to install it from
source using the guides on the KOffice and KDE Wikis (see Resources).
</p><p>
Start by launching Kexi and selecting create a Blank Database from
the startup wizard. Depending on the installed plugins, you will be able
to create a database stored as a file or create a database on an existing
database server,
such as PostgreSQL or MySQL. Selecting to have it stored in a file
is easiest for new users and is appropriate when there will be a
limited number of users accessing the database at any one time. Kexi
file-based databases use SQLite as the underlying format, so they are readable
by any SQLite-compatible program.
</p><p>
The database requires a name (I chose kexi_facebook), followed by a
location to save it. The default location is fine. After this, you are presented with
the main Kexi window. The main window contains a toolbar along the top and
a project navigator down the left-hand side. The main toolbar in Kexi
is different from the other KOffice applications and uses a tab-style
layout. Each opened window also has a local toolbar for options
specific to that window, such as table, query, form,
report and script.
</p><p>
From the Create tab across the top menu, choose Table to launch the
table designer.
</p><p>
The statistics I receive via e-mail include the date, number of new fans,
number of wall posts, number of visits and total fans, so I created a
table with the design schema shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f1.large.jpg"><img src="10828f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Table Design
</p></div></div><p>
The fields have a name, type and comment, and also several properties
are available from the property editor on the right-hand side, such as
constraints and a default value if none is given. Each object in the
database will have numerous properties associated with it, and the
property editor allows these to be displayed and edited in a single
location.
</p><p>
Switching to Data view prompts you to save the table and show the table data
editor allowing manual entry of records, but that's not much fun!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0xf12b40"></a>
Getting the Data</h2></div></div><p>
With my newly created but empty table, I needed to get the
data automatically. As I mentioned earlier, the data was in a single .mbox file containing
all e-mail messages. Kexi supports scripts, which can be written in ECMAScript
(aka JavaScript), Python or a number of other languages supported by Kross,
the KDE scripting framework. I chose to use the QTScript back end, which
allows writing in JavaScript, as I am more familiar with it than Python.
</p><p>
My script had to open the .mbox file, read it line by line, grab the
data it needed using string manipulation, and when a full set of data was
read, add it as a record to the database. Scripts not only have access to
built-in methods and Kexi-specific methods, but they also can import libraries
containing large amounts of useful functions&mdash;the most useful being the Qt
libraries. I use the Core functions to have access to the filesystem,
using QTextStream for reading data, and the GUI functions for access to
QMessageBox to present errors in a dialog if they occur.
</p><p>
From the Create menu tab, this time, I choose Script. This launches
the script editor in the central window and the property editor down
the right.
</p><p>
A script has only a few properties, the type and the interpreter. The
interpreter I want is QTScript, and the type is Executable. An executable
script is one that is meant to be run manually. A Module script is
meant to contain generic modules of code, accessible from other
scripts. And, an Object script is one that is tied to another database
object, such as a report.

The entire script is shown in Listing 1.

      var short_date = stat_date.getFullYear() + "-"
                     + pad(stat_date.getMonth() + 1, 2) + "-"

	    var msg = "Cannot insert into " + table.caption() + '\n';

function pad(number, length) {
  var str = '' + number;
  while (str.length &lt; length) {
    str = '0' + str;
  }
  return str;
}

</pre></div><p>
A possible bug in the script shown in Listing 1 is that it assumes
there are no current records in the table, and it creates primary keys
starting at 1. It is okay to run the script once, but if it is run again,
it tries to overwrite records that have an ID matching what it is trying
to insert. To make it more robust, it first needs to find out the
current maximum of the ID field (this would be a good exercise to get
used to writing scripts).
</p><p>
When executed from the script toolbar, the script gathered 11 records
worth of data, which is visible from the Table Data View (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Table Data
</p></div></div><p>
It's worth pointing out that the above script took a lot of trial and
error, as it is not initially obvious that it is possible to import
extra libraries or use Kexi-specific functions. The documentation needs
work to make this easier for new users,
and submissions are very welcome at the KDE Userbase Web site.

Sort the Data, Create a Query</h2></div></div><p>
At the moment, the data is ordered in the order in which it was extracted from
KMail. Because I need it to be in ascending date order, I created a query
to sort it. From the Create tab, this time I chose Query. I wanted all
fields except the auto-incrementing primary key, so I set it up as shown in
Figure 4.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0xf13a08"></a>
Bringing It Together with a Report</h2></div></div><p>
A new feature of Kexi 2 is the report plugin. This allows reports to be
designed and executed directly within Kexi using a GUI editor similar
to report designers in other database systems, such as Microsoft Access,
Crystal Reports or Oracle Reports. In Kexi 1.6, reports were available
as a separate add-on from kde-apps.org, but it did not contain as many
features as the version in Kexi 2, and it was not fully integrated with
the application, as the designer was an external program.
</p><p>
Reports can be printed, saved as a PDF, exported to HTML or OpenDocument
Spreadsheet files or simply remain in the database for live viewing. It
is possible to save the report in all these formats because of the two-stage
generation process. Reports first are rendered into an intermediate
description, and this description is used to generate the final version
in whatever format is selected. In a future version, it is likely that
extra formats will be supported, such as OpenDocument Text and XML,
suitable for further processing using XSLT.
</p><p>
From the Create tab, I choose Report to create a blank report with a single
&ldquo;Detail&rdquo; section. The structure of a report is based around Sections,
which can be page headers or footers, report header or footer, or Group
sections where data is grouped on a field value.
</p><p>
Initially, all I want is a simple tabular view of the data, so all the
fields will go into the detail section, apart from a header, and the field
titles, which must go either in a Page Header or Report Header. From
the Section Editor on the report toolbar, I added a Report Header, and
using the Report Design tab on the menu bar, I added fields and labels to
create the report layout. From the Data Source tab on the sidebar, I set
the reports data source to the qryStats query I created above. Finally, I
set the Control Source property of each field item to the corresponding
field in the query and the Caption of the labels appropriately. In the end,
it looked like Figure 6, and it generated a report, shown in
Figure 7.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f6.large.jpg"><img src="10828f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Report Design
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f7.large.jpg"><img src="10828f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Plain Report
</p></div></div><p>
This gets the job done, but it isn't quite as &ldquo;jazzed up&rdquo; as I would
like. It's common in desktop applications to alternate the background
color of rows to make it more obvious where each set of data begins
and ends, so let's try that.
</p><p>
I created another script, but this time set its type to Object, as it is
to be associated with the report object. Report scripts are
event-driven&mdash;that is, whenever a certain event occurs in the generation of the report,
the associated code in the script is called. Report scripts use the
features of Kross::Object, where each object in a report can be associated
with a script object, making it more object-oriented in nature. Each
script object can have its own variables and functions. Report objects
can be the report itself or any of the report sections. To make it more
clear, the final script looks like what's shown in Figure 8.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f8.large.jpg"><img src="10828f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Statistics Script
</p></div></div><p>
This is quite a simple script. There is an object called detail,
containing a function OnRender, which will be called whenever a detail
section is rendered. The function keeps track of how many times it has
been called and alternates the background color. The final line of
the script associates the detail function with the detail section of
the report.
</p><p>
Then, in the report, I set the Interpreter Type to QTScript and the
Object Script property to the name of the script. It is important that
the Interpreter type of both the report and script match; otherwise, the
script won't be presented as an option in the Object Script list.
</p><p>
The generated report now looks like Figure 9.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10828f9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Tabular Report 1
</p></div></div><p>
It's not so great with the white background on the fields, so I went back to the
designer and changed the Opacity property of each of the fields to 0 to
make them transparent, resulting in a more reasonable report 
(Figure 10).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10828f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0x1220858"></a>
Adding Something Trendy</h2></div></div><p>
My final requirement at this stage was to have something more graphical:
a nice chart to show the trend of fans over time. The report
designer allows the creation of charts using the KDChart library from KDAB
and is used in the KOffice program KChart. It is quite powerful,
allowing you to join chart data to the main report data (called
master-child links), but for now, all I needed was a simple, single
chart. The chart object expects data in a certain format. There must be two
or more columns of data. The first column is used for the labels on the
X axis, and all other columns are used as a series in the chart. I started by
creating a query with two columns, date in ascending order and total fans,
then created a new report. The report itself is not based on any data,
so its Data Source was left empty. An empty data source will produce a
report with one detail section, providing an area to add a minimal set of
items to a report.
</p><p>
In my detail section, I added a chart object from the report designer
toolbar and set its data source to the query I had just produced (Figure 11).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f11.large.jpg"><img src="10828f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Chart Design
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, even at design time, the chart object is able to gather
data and draw a preview of the chart. Switching to the data view shows
the chart without any of the extra lines and text from the designer (Figure 12).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f12.large.jpg"><img src="10828f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1a580.0x1220d80"></a>
Hard Copies</h2></div></div><p>
When printed, both the tabular report and chart report look as they do
in the Data view. When printed using the PDF printer option in KDE, the
chart even retains all its detail, as it is not converted to a bitmap,
but saved as lines, which makes it completely zoomable!
</p><p>
Saving the tabular report as an HTML document produces two options: saving
as a table or using CSS. The table option produces an HTML file where
the text from each field in a report is saved as a table cell, and each
section is a row. The CSS option uses the &lt;div&gt; tag and tries to
create an HTML file that closely resembles the original, allowing text
and images to be rendered at arbitrary positions.
</p><p>
The tabular report also exports nicely into an OpenDocument Spreadsheet
file for use in either KSpread or OpenOffice.org (Figure 13).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10828f13.large.jpg"><img src="10828f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. KSpread Data
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see from the image, one problem is that the report's title 
has taken a cell with the other field headings. This is because
it is in the same section, but it easily can be fixed by putting the title into a
separate section, such as a Page Header.
</p><p>
