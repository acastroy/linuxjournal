Say a Prayer for Open Source&mdash;Literally!</h4><p>
I just recently finished attending a Northern Minister's Convention in Sault
Ste Marie where many of the ministers were overwhelmed with costs of not
just hardware, but also software that they felt necessary to purchase to
maintain their congregations' technology. Upon doing some research, one
particular denomination did not qualify for one of the world's largest
software manufacturer's &ldquo;charitable organization discount&rdquo;. Upon hearing
this, I piped up, &ldquo;What about OpenOffice.org?&rdquo; It was as if I
were speaking
Latin! Nobody had heard of or considered it.
</p><p>
I have discovered over the years many pieces of software that have saved
churches thousands of dollars in software expenses, such as OpenOffice.org,
OpenSong (lyrics/projection/chord charts), OpenLP (lyrics and projection),
SQL-Ledger (bookkeeping) and many more. I believe that the charitable
donation sector (aka churches) is a prime candidate to take the ultimate
leap to open source and migrate to Linux as its OS of choice. When you
consider the thousands of dollars a church could spend on software in a
year, I would sooner see that money going to someone in a community that
needs it rather than a large, monopoly-like company. So if you have a
chance, pray for open source...and for the church! I will.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dean Anderson  <br><br>
</p><p>
I'm a deacon at a church, and sadly, even I haven't ever heard of OpenSong
or OpenLP. I'm both ashamed and now really excited to learn of them!
You're right, of course. I think churches are a prime place for open-source software to fit right in. Thanks for the software advice!&mdash;Shawn

File Renaming</h4><p>
I enjoyed Dave Taylor's article in the November 2010 issue &ldquo;Scripting
Common File Rename Operations&rdquo;.
I did find an error in the sample, where cut is used to get the extension
of a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
f=foo.bar.txt
echo "$f" | cut -d. -f2
</pre>
</p><p>
The above will result in &ldquo;bar.txt&rdquo; and not &ldquo;txt&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This works, however:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo ${f##*.}
</pre>
</p><p>
Second, I have had good experiences using co-processes in file rename
operations. For example, I often need to convert filenames to lowercase:

<pre     class="programlisting">

paste &lt;( ls -1 ) &lt;( ls -1 | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' ) | \
{ while read old new; do mv -v $old $new; done; }

</pre>
</p><p>
Treating the lists of names as text opens up a lot of possibilities in file
operations at reduced script complexity.
</p><p>
The following snippet using script generation works if there are spaces in
the filenames without having to fiddle with IFS:

<pre     class="programlisting">

paste &lt;( ls -1 ) &lt;( ls -1 | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' ) | \
gawk 'BEGIN { FS="\t"; } { printf("mv -v \"%s\" \
\"%s\"\n", $1, $2); }'

</pre>
</p><p>
The output can be piped into bash to run the script.
Generating the output before actually running the script makes it possible
to see and catch errors before actually doing anything.
</p><p>
One also can use co-processes to output and increment a counter generating a
column of numbers to use in incrementally numbering files with a common
base name:

<pre     class="programlisting">

paste &lt;(ls -1) &lt;( let i=0; for f in *; do echo
newFileBase_$((i++)).${f##*.}; done)

</pre>
</p><p>
I look forward to future editions of Dave's article!

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> I appreciate the feedback on my latest column,
Jeffrey! I can't say I have much experience with co-processes though.
Sometimes I feel like I'm <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> old-school Linux/UNIX, especially since
I've been using it since 1980&mdash;jeez, that's a long time!

Mutt</h4><p>
Regarding the article on Mutt and especially the Point/Counterpoint
discussion between Kyle and Bill on this (<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, October
2010), it's a pity neither of them seems
to be aware of Muttator (<a href="http://vimperator.org/muttator" target="_self">vimperator.org/muttator</a>).
I would've appreciated each gentleman's standpoint on that one.

D-Bus</h4><p>
I can't thank Koen Vervloesem enough for his wonderful article on D-Bus
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, November 2010). As a Linux
&ldquo;old-timer&rdquo;, it's been quite a learning experience for me to deal with
newer methodologies of hardware detection and management. I ran into the
world of D-Bus, Hal and udev about three years ago with my installation of
openSUSE 11.0, and access to devices was well, not quite up to par. Thus, I
began my immersion into this new world! Mostly, I concentrated on learning
about Hal and udev, not thinking at all about D-Bus (what the heck
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> that,
I thought), and trust me, that was way too much information for me at the time.
However, I was able to put some PolicyKit rules in place successfully
to accomplish my goal. I took Koen's advice and tracked down a graphical
D-Bus app&mdash;what I could find for my current openSUSE 11.3 implementation
was something called KDBus. I think this is lacking
<span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> of the features of
qdbusviewer, but wow, how cool at any rate. Now that KDE 4.x (and GNOME)
also uses D-Bus for session events, any time you do anything&mdash;accessing
hardware or applications in your desktop environment&mdash;you can see and
explore the new D-Bus events that are fired. It's very useful and
informative to track issues. Since my Linux setup still uses D-Bus, Hal
and udev, seeing what events get fired and are associated with which of
these hardware management layers is really very useful, and in some
cases, critical to &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; issues that arise.
Again, much thanks to Koen for this great article!

Keep Trying Linux</h4><p>
I just renewed my annual subscription and decided to add the digital edition
as well. I have to say, I am exceptionally pleased with the fine work you all
do at putting out <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and you can bet I will continue to be a
customer.
</p><p>
I have read often about the problems people have run into using Linux to
replace Windows systems, and my advice is just to keep trying Linux and open
source. I have been able to replace every Windows program with a Linux
program, (KMyMoney, Evolution, OpenOffice.org, and so on) with one
exception&mdash;video editing. Adobe Premiere keeps me tied to a partition I have set up
to run WinXP and Premeire Elements. Maybe one day Adobe will realize it can
keep a lot of customers happy and port Premiere to Linux.
</p><p>
My distro of choice is Ubuntu. I run Mythbuntu and Xubuntu with no problems. Thanks
again for the good work, and I look forward to a new year with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.

As a longtime Final Cut Pro user, I feel your video-editing pain.
Kris Occhipinti (some of his videos are on our Web site) convinced me to
try Kdenlive. Although I'm still not as comfortable with it as I am with
Final Cut, it does seem to be a viable alternative. It's just taking
some learning on my part.&mdash;Ed.

Don't Build Your Own NAS with RAID-5</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Drobo Shmobo&rdquo; piece in the November
2010 Upfront section, I hope <span   class="emphasis"><em>nobody</em></span> builds their own NAS with RAID-5. RAID-5 has a bad failure
mode when rebuilding an array due to a bad disk. When a bad disk is found, you
have a nontrivial chance of finding that you actually had
<span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> bad disks
during the rebuild, causing the array to be lost. RAID-6, on the other hand,
is able to rebuild an array with two failed disks.
</p><p>
In any event, regardless of RAID-5 or RAID-6, you should make sure you run
disk checks periodically. For md-raid, for example, for md0:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# echo check &gt; /sys/block/md0/md/sync_action
</pre>
</p><p>
You may want to put that in root's crontab or in a script in, say,
/etc/cron.weekly.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David N. Lombard  <br><br>
</p><p>
Although I appreciate your worries about multiple disk failures and RAID-5,
for me (I wrote the article), another drive just isn't possible. I already
have my workstation-size computer maxed out with drives, and if I were
to sacrifice one of the drives for RAID-6, I wouldn't have enough storage.
Perhaps my huge array filled with 2TB drives isn't the norm, so I'll
agree if it's feasible, RAID-6 certainly makes sense.
</p><p>
Oh, and your disk check is right on. It's very good practice, and something
Bill Childers reminded me to set up the last time I had a hard drive
failure in my server!&mdash;Ed.

A Superior Technology</h4><p>
Puppy Studio began as an experiment. Was it possible to have a full-featured
multimedia creation suite similar to Ubuntu Studio running on Puppy Linux?
Puppy was fast and ran entirely in RAM, so the real-time recording
capabilities could be amazing. But, would they?
</p><p>
My original hypothesis was correct. Puppy gave the studio vastly improved
latency, by virtue of running in RAM and its small size, unmatched
by any other OS. Then, I compiled a custom real-time kernel, and performance
went through the roof!
3.1 is out: <a href="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=458075#458075" target="_self">www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=458075#458075</a>.

Simple Success</h4><p>
I'm a physics teacher with a new toy. I've got a Tablet PC issued by my
school. I GNU (ha!) the instant I got the thing what I was going to do with
it: run Linux. We have nice IT guys who generously tolerate such behavior.
They were frankly intrigued when I told them I created a Linux partition on my
hard drive. One of my IT buddies said, &ldquo;Most teachers aren't going to use even
20% of the capacity of these things. Let me know how it works out.&rdquo; Here's
what a simple Linux partition can do: play a DVD without taking ten minutes to
detect the disc or freezing. Even better, there is absolutely no issue
connecting to LCD projectors or detecting monitors. It is plug and play.
Xarnal lets me write on PDF'd homework sets and save them to the class
Dropbox file, so students can see what I did later from their phones, laptops
and desktops. Need some extra homework problems? Not an issue. I can hop on
the command line and use <tt  >wget -i</tt> to download an entire MIT physics class (with PDF
problem sets). Why re-invent the wheel? 
</p><p>
Is Linux perfect? No. I don't like
Linux screencasting software. I'm frankly resentful that rotating screens on
my tablet PC is such a pain. I wish there were a driver for my wireless LCD
connector. But, it is really hard to beat free-as-in-beer software that runs
fast. 
</p><p>
I'm really excited to continue this dual-booting experiment in the
classroom. With work and time, it would be great if my entire class were run
on Linux. I guess I could moan and groan that it's not totally feasible just
yet, but I'm choosing to focus on the answers not the problems. It's hard not
to feel grateful to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and all the people who are way smarter than
me who have shown me all these tools that I can use without having to think
too much. Thanks guys!

It's great to hear the tablet <span   class="emphasis"><em>mostly</em></span> does what you need in Linux.
Honestly, the cooler part for me is to hear your IT department was okay with
letting you fiddle with Linux at all! I think that attitude will help get
Linux into education more than all the free software alone ever
could do.&mdash;Ed.

Transparent Firewalls with Linux Series</h4><p>
I've enjoyed the recent series of articles by Mick Bauer in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> on
transparent firewalls, but unfortunately, Mr Bauer has some
misunderstandings about how the hardware (Linksys WRT54GL) actually works,
which leads to some erroneous conclusions.
</p><p>
The Linksys WRT54GL is based on a Broadcom BCM5352 SoC (System-on-Chip).
The key word here is system, since part of the system includes a six-port
switch. Five of these ports you can see, and one is internal to the chip.
</p><p>
In part IV of the series (December 2010), Mr Bauer can't understand why iptables ignores
inter-VLAN traffic. The reason is simple. The kernel never sees it because
it is handled by the switch, and packets never make it to the CPU. Also,
port 5 (the common port) is not a virtual port but real in
every sense of the word. It exists in silicon and is part of the switch
that connects to the CPU.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, full specifications for this chip seem to be available
only under a non-disclosure agreement, but generic overview pamphlets are
available that show this. This is also discussed on the OpenWrt forum.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Gus Wirth  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span> Thanks much for the clarifications and for confirming
my suspicion that entire categories of the WRT54GL's packets are never seen
by the kernel or CPU. Note that in at least one case, I'm guilty of
oversimplification rather than ignorance: when I call port 5
&ldquo;virtual&rdquo;, I
mean only that you can't plug an Ethernet cable in to it, not that it
doesn't exist in some other tangible way.
</p><p>
It would be great if the OpenWrt team would address transparent firewalling
in its official documentation, or at least in a FAQ or wiki. In my lengthy
research efforts for this project, key details concerning the inner
workings and interactions of WRT54G hardware, OpenWrt and relevant parts
of the Linux kernel were either missing from OpenWrt documentation,
mentioned only in passing in on-line forums or simply nowhere to be found.

Best Linux Vendor?</h4><p>
I'm just reading the Readers' Choice Awards for 2010 (see the December 2010
issue), and I notice that the
best Linux vendor for both laptops and desktops is Dell.
I thought things must have changed at Dell since I last looked at its
offerings, so I checked out what it had to offer.
With great difficulty, and after a great deal of searching, I finally
was able to locate some laptops that came with Linux preloaded&mdash;with Ubuntu
9.10.
So, I'm confused by how Dell got a Readers' Choice Award for being the
&ldquo;Best
Vendor&rdquo;.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
lauzon   <br><br>
</p><p>
I guess you'd have to ask all the readers why they voted for Dell! In all
seriousness though, my guess is the votes were based on price and
compatibility, not pre-installed options. There certainly are more
Linux-friendly vendors, but all too often when we order hardware anymore,
we don't even bother to look at what is pre-installed. I don't think
that's a good thing, but I think it happens a lot.&mdash;Ed.

PiTiVi</h4><p>
Just wanted to drop you guys a note and say thanks to Jono Bacon (and to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>)
for the great article on PiTiVi in the December 2010 issue. I do a video review show about comic books
and graphic novels (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/The2dogknight" target="_self">www.youtube.com/user/The2dogknight</a>), and I use
PiTiVi to put the show together, but I never knew how to do fades. Now I do!
I plan to use fades in my next episode.
Love the magazine, and please keep up the great work!
