GNOME and KDE may be the heavy-hitters of the desktop world, and
although all that power is nice, sometimes it's too bulky. That's
where other desktop managers come in.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b4300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It's dangerous for me to use sports metaphors, because my expertise
ends at knowing there are three strikes in an out. When it comes to
sitting the bench, however, I'm a veteran professional! Most major
distributions choose one of the big hitters for their desktop management
systems. GNOME and KDE continue the epic battle that keeps the competition
intense and our desktops diverse. In honor of this month's Desktop
issue, I thought it would be nice to pay some homage to those desktop
managers and windows managers that don't get quite as much attention.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b44b8"></a>
Window Managers and Desktop Managers</h2></div></div><p>
Before we delve too deep into comparing the various Linux GUIs out there,
it's important to understand the difference between window managers
and desktop managers. The nuances between the two can be subtle and
at times almost nonexistent. A window manager is simply the program
running on top of the X server itself that manages windows. Some are
very sparse in their features, and some are so robust they approach the
usability of a full-blown desktop manager.
</p><p>
So, what is a desktop manager, you ask? Well, it's more of a total
user-interaction interface. It often includes applications,
widgets and system integration. In fact, desktop managers (or desktop
environments, as they're sometimes called) include a window manager
as part of their arsenal. So, although GNOME is a desktop manager, part
of the GNOME environment includes Metacity, which is a window manager
GNOME uses for, well, managing its windows. It's possible to run a
Linux system with only a window manager, as I talk about later,
but usually a Linux distribution comes with some sort of desktop
manager installed by default.

The Battle for Ubuntu's Bottom End</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu and Kubuntu certainly are the first-string players for
Canonical's Linux lineup. Granted, with Ubuntu 11.04, its
flagship product will switch from using a standard GNOME interface to
the Unity shell normally used only in its Netbook product, but at
least historically, Ubuntu has used GNOME, and Kubuntu has used KDE.
Canonical also has its official Xubuntu version for older or
less-powerful hardware. Xubuntu runs the XFCE desktop manager. Although it
does require fewer resources than GNOME or KDE, many still think XFCE is
rather bloated for slower hardware. There is another option, Lubuntu,
but it's not officially supported by Canonical. Instead of XFCE,
Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop environment. The Lubuntu team claims to
be much less resource-intensive, so I installed them both to see how
they &ldquo;feel&rdquo; in everyday use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b47d0"></a>
Xubuntu and XFCE</h2></div></div><p>
Xubuntu's install is pretty much like every other flavor of Ubuntu.
In fact, it's pretty much like every other flavor of Linux. Gone are
the days of difficult installs, and even if you choose to use a text-based
installer, the process is dead simple&mdash;so simple, in fact, it's silly
to include a screenshot. It looks like an installer. Trust me.
</p><p>
Current versions of Xubuntu are a little shocking in just how much they
resemble their GNOME-y counterparts. In fact, the Xubuntu desktop in
version 10.10 looks like a slightly bluer version of Ubuntu 10.10.
Certainly this is Canonical's tweaking&mdash;a very
nice job of making its lighter-on-the-resources desktop look exactly
like its big brother. Unfortunately, appearance isn't the only place
Xubuntu is identical to Ubuntu. Figure 1 shows a freshly booted install
of Ubuntu, with no programs running other than the terminal displayed.
You can see the freshly booted new install uses approximately 328MB of
the 512MB installed on my machine. When I turned to the Xubuntu install,
which runs XFCE instead of GNOME, I expected to see a much lower memory
usage upon booting up. I was shocked to see Xubuntu using 325MB, almost
identical to the Ubuntu install (Figure 2).

Figure 2. A freshly booted, default install of Xubuntu 10.10 uses 325MB of
RAM&mdash;almost identical to Ubuntu.
</p></div></div><p>
The big difference with Xubuntu isn't really how much RAM the desktop
manager uses, but rather the default applications installed. When I
start Xubuntu's Exaile music application versus Ubuntu's Rhythmbox,
it does indeed use less RAM, and it starts up faster. However, getting
rid of Rhythmbox on Ubuntu and installing Exaile in its place gives the
same advantage while using GNOME under Ubuntu. In fact, although Xubuntu
and XFCE do feel faster in use, in every case I've tested, it seems to
be due only to the default applications. If you're a GNOME fan,
Xubuntu might be a big change for little reward. Keep GNOME, install
some faster applications, and you might get the best of both worlds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b4cf8"></a>
Lubuntu and LXDE</h2></div></div><p>
It turns out I'm not the only person to notice that Xubuntu doesn't really
tailor itself to low-end hardware as much as it claims to. The folks
in charge of the Lubuntu Project decided improving performance for
slower machines should include more than installing zippy applications
by default. Just like with Xubuntu, Lubuntu installs in an extremely
unexciting and completely functional way. Once installed, however,
Lubuntu does differ from Xubuntu and Ubuntu in appearance.
</p><p>
Although a similar blue to Xubuntu, Lubuntu's screen layout is visually
different. Figure 3 shows Lubuntu's simple single taskbar layout,
which is quite similar to the design Microsoft has been trying to perfect since
the days of Windows 95. That's not a bad thing. As a group we
may not care for Microsoft, but its start-menu-type system is widely known
and very usable. The first thing I did upon booting Lubuntu was open a
terminal and check the memory usage. You can see in Figure 4 that Lubuntu
is using only 163MB of RAM when fully booted. That's almost exactly
half the RAM Xubuntu and Ubuntu use when freshly booted. When you
add to that the selection of fast and small applications Lubuntu uses
by default, including the Chromium Web browser, it really does scream
even on low-end or old computers. If you've been frustrated with your
computer's poor performance with either GNOME under Ubuntu or XFCE
under Xubuntu, you may want to give Lubuntu a try. It uses the same
repositories, and it has remarkable compatibility with more well-known,
if not bulkier, applications.

What about Others?</h2></div></div><p>
There are more to the alternatives than just speed. I used the Ubuntu
example above to demonstrate how alternatives to the &ldquo;Big 2&rdquo; can give
you advantages in speed, but there are other reasons to veer from the norm
as well. The ROX Desktop, for example, is a complete desktop environment
designed around a file manager&mdash;the ROX-Filer, to be specific. Although the
ROX Desktop is certainly light on system resource needs, its design
and integration with the filesystem is what really makes it
unique.
Figure 5 shows a screenshot of Puppy Linux, which uses ROX-Filer as the
file manager.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10946f5.large.jpg"><img src="10946f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Puppy Linux Using ROX-Filer (screenshot by
Joachim K&ouml;hle)
</p></div></div><p>
The ROX Desktop suite includes its own window manager, OroboROX, but like
most other desktop environments, it doesn't rely on one specific window
manager to work. When you find a window manager you like, it's often
possible to use it seamlessly with whatever desktop management system
you want. In fact, many people, and even entire distributions, run 
only a window manager. This is possible because many window managers are
so feature-rich, they do most of the things a desktop manager would do.
One good example of that is Enlightenment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27bc580.0x28b5538"></a>
The Enlightened Don't Need a Desktop Manager</h2></div></div><p>
Enlightenment is a window manager that has been around a long time. 
Some window managers are minimalistic; however, Enlightenment is extremely
feature-rich. It provides a file manager, a dock, a GUI configuration
tool, application launchers&mdash;pretty much everything required in a full-blown desktop environment. Does that mean it's a desktop manager and
not just a window manager? Perhaps. It doesn't really matter how
you define it though. Enlightenment is one of
those things everyone should
try at least once. There are even live CDs, specifically designed
for trying Enlightenment. Figure 6 shows applications running
under the Elive CD default desktop.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10946f6.large.jpg"><img src="10946f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
IceWM is another window manager that is rather profound in the features
it offers. Although it doesn't have a mechanism for creating desktop
icons, it does have a very robust menu system and application suite for
managing most aspects of the Linux desktop. IceWM is very customizable,
and although it uses the familiar Windows-like start menu, it doesn't try
to clone Microsoft. In fact, I use a combination of IceWM and Nautilus
on my network of 150 older thin clients because it's fast and reliable.
Because the menu system is controlled with a single system-wide config file,
it makes wide-scale customization a breeze.
</p><p>
A multitude of Linux distributions have only a window
manager to manipulate the desktop. Blackbox, Fluxbox and Openbox
are all related window managers. Fluxbox is a fork of Blackbox, and
although Openbox is all original code now, it started as a fork of
Blackbox as well. These three window managers are lightning fast.
They may not offer the same level of features and complexity
that Enlightenment or IceWM do, but for many minimalistic distributions, they are
just perfect. CrunchBang Linux is a prime example of a full-featured,
yet minimalistic distribution. It uses Openbox as its window manager,
and as you can see in Figure 7, the windowing environment is designed
to get out of the user's way.

Choice, the Ultimate Freedom</h2></div></div><p>
The great thing about choosing a Linux GUI is that it costs you nothing
to change. Whether you like Fedora's default GNOME install or
prefer openSUSE's green-lizard KDE install, every Linux install
can be tweaked or changed. I must warn you though, once you try the
NeXTSTEP clones Window Maker or AfterStep, you might never want to
see a start menu again. If you experiment with the mouseless beauty
of the Ratpoison window manager, you might never want to click
again.
Or, perhaps you're at the other end of the spectrum, and you want to
fool yourself or others into thinking you are running OS X. Check out
the free Macbuntu GNOME theme. With Linux, customization is king,
and the options are seemingly endless. I created a chart
to help you sort out some of the Linux GUI options available (see Table 1). It's by
no means an exhaustive list, but it should get you started. Remember,
just because a desktop environment is sitting on the bench doesn't
mean it didn't make the team. Check out the bench-warmers, you might
just find a winner.
