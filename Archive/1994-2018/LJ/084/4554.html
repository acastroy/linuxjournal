    Pursuing new markets like webpads may be the way for Transmeta

widely covered public announcement [see &ldquo;Linley on Linux&rdquo; April
2000], Transmeta has had a busy year. The company began shipping
its first products, gained several significant design wins and
successfully executed an IPO. Although its stock price has since
been cut in half, Transmeta still carries an impressive market cap
of about $3 billion US. The company has seen tougher-than-expected
competition from Intel in the PC market as well as slow movement in
the webpad market. On the other hand, Transmeta recently opened up
a third front in the server market. The startup, also famous for
being Linus Torvalds' employer, produces the Crusoe chip that is
compatible with Intel's processors but uses less power. This
accomplishment is due to its unique code-morphing technology that
emulates Intel's architecture on simpler VLIW hardware. Initially,
Transmeta believed that Intel could not match Crusoe's low-power
consumption without developing its own code-morphing technology,
which would take years. But Intel fought back quickly.
</p><p>Without access to code morphing, Intel instead took advantage
of its superior manufacturing technology to reduce the power
consumption of its chips. Last June, Intel rolled out new
processors that operate at lower voltages than Transmeta's
IBM-built chips (IBM has manufacturing technology similar to
Intel's but reserves it for internal products). Although some
studies show that Crusoe still has an edge in power savings, its
advantage over Intel's latest chips is small.</p><p>Transmeta has also failed to produce any useful performance
data for its processor. To be fair, code morphing makes
benchmarking difficult; the Crusoe chip actually gets faster if you
run a program more often. Testing of initial Crusoe systems found
their performance to be roughly that of a mere 300MHz Pentium III,
but these tests ran the benchmark program only once. How fast the
chip would run with more &ldquo;practice&rdquo; remains unclear, as Transmeta
itself still isn't talking.</p><p>With its core messages of performance and low power under
attack, Transmeta made limited headway in the notebook PC market
over the past year. The company placed Crusoe in new ultralight PCs
from Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC. These systems are aimed mainly
at the Japanese market, where space and power savings are at a
premium. The leading makers of notebook PCs for the US market&mdash;IBM,
Toshiba, Compaq and Dell&mdash;have yet to roll out any Crusoe-based
systems, although all have evaluated Transmeta's technology. As a
result, Transmeta's share of the ultralight PC market is perhaps
10% so far. Since that market is just a small fraction of the PC
market, Transmeta holds far less than 1% of the total PC processor
market. Thus, the company poses little threat to Intel's revenues.
Transmeta doesn't need much of Intel's market; however, about 50%
of the ultralight PC market would help Transmeta break even.</p><p>Investors are hoping for more than breaking even, as
Transmeta has lost more than $200 million since it was founded and
will probably lose another $50 million, even if it reaches its goal
of profitability by the end of this year. Investors want some
payback. That's where new markets come in. Transmeta's second
target market is webpads. These portable devices access web content
through a wireless link, showing it on a flat-panel display.
Webpads typically use PC-compatible processors, allowing them to
run all the plug-ins on the Web but don't need to run Windows; many
use Linux instead. The good news is that virtually every webpad
announced to date uses Crusoe for its unique combination of
low-power consumption, PC compatibility and low price. Companies
such as Gateway, Phillips, Hitachi and Frontpath (formerly S3) have
selected Crusoe for their webpads.</p><p>The bad news: webpad sales have been minimal to date, slowed
by prices that are often $1,000 or more. The most expensive part of
these webpads is the flat-panel display, which can cost several
hundred dollars alone. However, the recent slowdown in PC sales has
reduced demand for flat panels, causing prices to drop. With
panel-manufacturing capacity continuing to increase, these prices
should fall dramatically and help webpads become more popular in
2001. Still, Transmeta expects webpads to contribute less than 20%
of its revenue this year.</p><p>Transmeta recently added web servers as a third target
market. Although Crusoe is not as powerful as server processors
from Intel and others, the low-power chip doesn't need a bulky heat
sink or other cooling equipment. This enables vendors to pack
several Crusoe chips into the space required by a single
power-hungry Intel chip. Since the task of serving web pages can be
easily divided among several processors, Crusoe makes up in numbers
what it lacks in individual performance.</p><p>So far, only a single small company has endorsed Transmeta's
server vision, and Transmeta expects little server revenue in 2001.
But this rapidly growing market represents another opportunity for
Crusoe, even if Intel can block Transmeta in the PC market.
Transmeta hopes PC revenues can tide it over until these new
markets begin to flourish. In 2002, we may finally see Transmeta's
full business plan in action.</p></div></div>
