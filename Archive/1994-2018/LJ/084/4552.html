Transit (BART): Under Control with Linux</h2></div></div><p>by Gary A. Messenbrink and Frank Ruffa</p><p>In the Operations Control Center (OCC), 20 feet underground
in the heart of Oakland, California, the Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) system is managed by a group of dedicated individuals tasked
with moving residents quickly and safely from one end of the San
Francisco Bay area to the other.</p><p>Along the sides of the room are 30 projection TV systems that
display the Train Control map for the system and the Traction Power
Electrification Display. The TV projection systems are driven off
of NCD X terminals that connect to a Tandem S4000 that maintains
the state of the system. The controllers use Sun workstations to
query and manage the system, which in turns communicates to the
Tandem.</p><p>The extension of the BART system to the San Francisco Airport
required an upgrade to the Electrification Display Systems of the
OCC to be available by July of 2000. In planning to support this
upgrade, we decided to improve some of the human factors relative
to managing the system too.</p><p>The system was originally designed to use multiple
high-resolution (for the time) Tektronix displays. As a result,
experienced controllers could quickly glance at these displays and
immediately grasp the state of the system. In moving from the
Tektronix displays to Sun workstations, the concept of overlapping
windows was introduced because of limited screen real estate.
Although functionality was increased, the overlapping displays were
not popular with the controllers as they lost the ability to
understand the system at a glance.</p><p>Sony has recently released 24-inch monitors with larger
screens. With the wider 16:9 aspect ratio, these monitors were
ideal for the type of landscape display that BART needed to
eliminate overlapping windows. Unfortunately, the Sun Solaris 2.4
operating system didn't provide support for these new monitors as
the resolutions required, forcing us to investigate other
options.</p><p>We quickly found that the open-source nature of Linux
provided the solution. Supporting the new monitors required nothing
more than some simple changes to the configuration file used by
XFree86. With this knowledge, we selected an economical
off-the-shelf PC system driving the Sony 24-inch monitor running
Linux as our new OCC workstation.</p><p>We selected Motif as our user-interface toolkit, instead of
using Qt or GTK+, based its proven rock-solid stability in
mission-critical applications. Then we started looking for software
that would speed the development of user interfaces and deliver an
improved graphical display of the system. We found solutions to
both of these needs with LOOX++ from LOOX Software
(<a href="http://www.loox.com" target="_self">http://www.loox.com/</a>) and
Builder Xcessory PRO (a 1999 <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s
Editors' Choice award) from ICS
(<a href="http://www.ics.com" target="_self">http://www.ics.com/</a>).
LOOX++ simplified the visualization of our Electrification System
by providing us with the ability to easily create a graphical
display for our model. We used Builder Xcessory PRO to quickly
build and tailor the graphical user interface for the
application.</p><p>The development of the new electrification software started
in December of 1999 and took approximately three months, meeting
the required date to support the San Francisco Airport Extension.
The Suns that once ran the controller workstations have been
retired, and Linux is now the workstation used by all controllers
in the OCC.</p><p>Given the potential for human tragedy resulting from either a
hardware or software failure, our selection of Linux was initially
a politically charged issue. However, we have demonstrated
considerable success with the new Electrification System and have
recently been given the approval to initiate the second phase and
convert the Train Control System to Linux, too.</p><p>The use of commodity PC hardware, not having to purchase
software licenses for the operating environment and the rapid
development tools resulted in a cost savings of approximately
15-20% of the project budget. The performance record of the Linux
environment has been flawless despite the 24/7 active
operation.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Gary A.

<a href="http://www.penguin-place.com" target="_self">www.penguin-place.com</a>)
we recently found two reports of great interest and no importance
suggesting that penguins are unusually sporting birds.</p><p>Item #1: Bird Bowling: The British Air Force in the Falkland
Islands discovered a way to &ldquo;bowl&rdquo; for penguins by flying over
large groups of the groundbound birds. See, penguins are observant
creatures that are unusually interested in airplanes (flight envy
perhaps?). Herds of up to ten thousand penguins will, in unison,
all point their beaks at a plane flying overhead, tracking it
accurately as it passes by. Sooo...if the pilots fly over the
penguins at just the right angle, the little animals all fall over
backwards&mdash;again in unison&mdash;just as the plane passes
overhead.</p><p>Item #2: Birdball: The penguins hanging around the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution in Antarctica have been observed to take
interest in games of football played by humans on flat fields of
snow and ice.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One day the scientists came out to discover that
the penguins had taken the field. They would line up in two rough
groups, and then start squawking and running around bumping into
each other. After a bit of this, they would pick themselves up and
start the process all over again. They hadn't quite got the idea
that a ball was important to the process, but they kept at it for
some time. The sight was so ridiculous that everyone was rolling on
the ice laughing.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2142580.0x26348a8"></a>Stop the Presses: Kylix Clix with CLX</h2></div></div><p>Borland, the development tools company that recently returned
to its original name (shedding the confusing &ldquo;Inprise&rdquo;), has
finally come out with Kylix, its long-awaited rapid application
development (RAD) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for
Linux&mdash;and for cross-platform development as well.</p><p>Developed entirely for Linux as a native Linux development
toolset, Kylix is also very familiar to users of Delphi, Borland's
popular Windows RAD toolset. Kylix not only allows developers to
use nearly identical tools and skills but to move Delphi-developed
Windows applications over to Linux. Borland claims there are over
two million Delphi and C++ Builder users, millions of applications,
thousands of vertical and horizontal components, and over five
hundred registered third-party tool and component vendors that will
easily leverage from the Windows world to Linux using Kylix.</p><p>At the core of Kylix is the Component Library for Cross
Platform Development, or CLX, pronounced &ldquo;clicks&rdquo;. This is an
open-source application infrastructure that supports both the
commercial version of Kylix and the core component architecture,
which Borland is releasing under the General Public License (GPL).
These are expressed in three product editions: Open Edition,
Desktop Developer and Server Developer. All three are available as
shrink-wrapped products with the Open Edition available for free
download as well. All CLX class libraries, however, are open source
and GPL'd.</p><p>Like other commercial Linux vendors, Borland is attempting to
support both commercial application development and ubiquitous
Linux-based infrastructure. There is plenty of demand for both.
This was manifest before the Kylix project began, when Borland
conducted an extensive survey (partly through <i  >Linux Journal</i>) in 1999. The survey had more than 24,000
responses that included both Linux and Windows developers. RAD
development tools were at the top of the wish list for both groups.
The top types of planned applications were application/utility
development and client/server database development.</p><p>Ted Shelton characterizes Kylix's potential impact this
way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Imagine what would happen if Microsoft open
sourced .Net, the crown jewels of their new strategy to dominate
the emerging market for &ldquo;web services&rdquo;. Imagine how thousands of
developers would be able to take .Net and not just build
applications with it, but truly extend it&mdash;move it to new operating
systems, add functionality, specialize key interfaces for new
devices, environments and vertical applications. Imagine how fast
the world would change. We're ready to provide the drills, hammers
and circular saws for developers to build an entirely new
application infrastructure, one that will be industrial strength,
open source and Linux-ready.</p></blockquote></div><p>After the press conference announcing Kylix, it appeared to
me that the deepest significance of Kylix may be in its
cross-platform class libraries&mdash;in CLX. During the conference,
Borland CEO and President Dale Fuller compared CLX to .Net, calling
CLX &ldquo;.Now&rdquo;. I asked Ted Shelton if this positioned CLX as a
cross-platform framework that competed not only with .Net (which is
not really cross-platform but cross-language within the Windows
platform), but with Java as well. He replied, &ldquo;When you develop,
you essentially choose a set of class libraries. Java offers one.
Microsoft offers another with .Net. CLX is now the third. But it's
the only one that is both open source and cross platform. I expect
that after the Open Source community gets into it, the CLX
libraries will outnumber Java's.&rdquo;

acronym, NIC, and perhaps best known as the creation of Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison, who owns it personally) has teamed up with Menta
Software to offer the equally inexpensive and ironic combination of
Windows apps running across the Net on a $199 US Linux &ldquo;thin&rdquo;
client. The NIC, which was shown running Menta's &ldquo;thin server&rdquo;
WinToNet at Linux World Expo in New York, is designed for schools
and other &ldquo;price sensitive&rdquo; networked environments.</p><p>We asked Gina Smith, NIC's CEO (and former high-profile
journalist) to give us the skinny on adding value to extra-thin
devices. &ldquo;It is really cool&rdquo;, she said. &ldquo;Basically, our system
is a super-affordable hard disk-free Linux client. We have 56K
modem and Ethernet connections built in. Using Menta's Java app, we
can run Windows apps from a server over the Internet.&rdquo; Adds
Menta's Bruce Fryer, &ldquo;Why put fat apps on a thin client? When
people see WinToNet running on the NIC, they are blown
away.&rdquo;</p><p>What are their chances? Consider these two facts: 1) their
sole stockholder is worth a few dozen billion dollars&mdash;give or take
a few billion a day; and 2) their home page features a prominent
