    A simple but quite useful addition to your administration
    command vocabulary.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d59558"></a></h2></div></div><p>I love discovering new UNIX commands,
especially those with a system administration flavor. When I
learned Red Hat distributed the
<span   class="bold"><b>chkconfig</b></span> utility, it brought back
fond memories of chkconfig under IRIX, a UNIX variant from Silicon
Graphics, Inc. IRIX's chkconfig was designed to enable/disable
services for automatic launch during system initialization without
editing, renaming or moving initscripts in <b  >/etc</b>.
</p><p>Similarly, Red Hat designed chkconfig to help manage services
launched during system initialization. But, after perusing the man
page and doing some tests, I soon found that Red Hat extended
chkconfig with finer control of system startup/shutdown tasks by
managing the symbolic links to initscripts. It's a real
time-saver!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d59768"></a>Startup Basics</h2></div></div><p>When your Linux box boots, the first process that shows up is
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>. If you haven't seen init
before, take a moment to type <b  >ps -ef | grep init</b>
to see the PID of init. In short, the init performs tasks that are
outlined in /etc/inittab.</p><p>Some tasks outlined in /etc/inittab will be launched soon
after init, while others are simply set up. For example, the
default Red Hat /etc/inittab sets up a trap for the key sequence
Ctrl-Alt-Delete. When these keys are simultaneously pressed at a
console prompt (not xdm), the shutdown command is performed. At
boot time, init sets up this feature based on configuration options
in /etc/inittab, but execution is postponed until the key sequence
occurs.</p><p>The format of inittab allows for comment lines beginning with
a &ldquo;#&rdquo; symbol while normal entries are &ldquo;:&rdquo; delimited. They
follow the pattern <b  >id:runlevel:action:process</b>
where id represents a user-defined and unique identifier, runlevel
can be a combination of the numbers 0-6 or just left blank, action
comes from a keyword that describes how init should treat the
process, and process is the command to execute.</p><p>Descriptions of various keywords for the action field can
typically be found in the man pages for inittab. Common keywords
across most, if not all, UNIX platforms include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>initdefault&mdash;defines the runlevel to enter once the
system has booted.</p></li><li><p>wait&mdash;a process that will be executed once (when
the runlevel is entered). The init process will wait for this
process to terminate.</p></li><li><p>boot&mdash;defines a process that is executed at boot
time.</p></li><li><p>bootwait&mdash;similar to boot but init waits for the
process to terminate before moving on.</p></li><li><p>sysinit&mdash;defines a process that is executed at boot
time before any boot or bootwait inittab entries.</p></li></ul></div><p>The runlevel field designates system state. For example, a
runlevel of 0 corresponds to a halted system while a runlevel of 6
corresponds to a system reboot. Unfortunately, all Linux
distributions do not follow the same definition for runlevels.
Under Red Hat, the following defaults are supported:
<pre     class="programlisting">
   0.   System halt
   1.   Single-user mode
   2.   Multiuser, without NFS
   3.   Complete multiuser mode
   4.   User defined
   5.   X11 (XDM login)
   6.   Reboot
</pre>


</p><p>For each runlevel, there is a corresponding directory in
/etc/rc.d. For a runlevel of 5, the directory /etc/rc.d/rc5.d
exists and contains files related to tasks that need to be
performed when booting into that runlevel. Under Red Hat, these
files are typically symbolic links to shell scripts found in
/etc/rc.d/init.d.</p><p>Let's put this all together with a simple example. Below are
two sample lines from our inittab file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:3:initdefault:
l3:3:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 3
</pre><p>Here is a typical scenario of what happens under Red Hat.
Once init is started, it reads /etc/inittab (see above). From the
first line, we know that init is going to end up at a runlevel of 3
after the system boots. Once we reach that runlevel, the second
line tells init to run the script /etc/rc.d/rc three and waits for
it to terminate before proceeding.
</p><p>The script rc in /etc/rc.d receives 3 as an argument. This 3
corresponds to a runlevel of 3. As a result, the rc script executes
all the scripts in the /etc/rc.d/rc3.d directory. It first executes
all the scripts that begin with the letter K (meaning &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the
process or service) with an argument of &ldquo;stop&rdquo;. Next, it runs all
the scripts that begin with the letter S with an argument of
&ldquo;start&rdquo; to start the process or service. As one final note, the
order of K and S script execution is based on sort order; the
script named S90mysql would execute before the script named
S95httpd.</p><p>It turns out the scripts in /etc/rc.d/rc3.d are actually
symbolic links to scripts residing in /etc/rc.d/init.d. While the
UNIX administrator can place scripts in rc3.d, the common practice
under Red Hat is to first place all scripts in init.d, then create
logical links to the rc*.d directories. It doesn't take long to
figure out the creation and maintenance of these scripts and
symbolic links could be quite the chore. That's precisely where
chkconfig steps in! The Red Hat chkconfig utility is specifically
designed to manage the symbolic links in
/etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d5a108"></a>Viewing chkconfig Entries</h2></div></div><p>The chkconfig binary resides in /sbin with default
permissions that allow any user to execute it, although the user
without root privileges can only view the current chkconfig
configuration. So type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# chkconfig --list | grep on
</pre><p>A partial listing of the output would look similar to the
following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
amd 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:on 5:on 6:off
apmd 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:off 4:on 5:off 6:off
arpwatch 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
atd 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off
autofs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
named 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
bootparamd 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:off 4:off 5:off 6:off
keytable 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off
crond 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off
syslog 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off
netfs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off
network 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off
</pre>


On each line of output, the first field represents the name of an
initscript in /etc/rc.d/init.d. The remaining fields correspond to
the runlevels 0-6 along with the status of the script when entering
that runlevel. For example, <span   class="bold"><b>crond</b></span>
would be launched when entering the runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5 and
stopped when entering the runlevels 0, 1 and 6. We can confirm that
these settings are true with the
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command to search for all
files in <b  >/etc/rc.d</b> that end with crond:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# find /etc/rc.d -name '*crond' -print
/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K60crond
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K60crond
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K60crond
</pre>


Notice for each &ldquo;off&rdquo; section reported by chkconfig (0, 1, 6), a
kill script is in place and for each &ldquo;on&rdquo; section reported (2, 3,
4, 5), a start script exists. Next, execute a different find
command to determine the type of each file found:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# find /etc/rc.d -name '*crond' -exec file {} \;
/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond: Bourne shell script text
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K60crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K60crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S40crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S40crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S40crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S40crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K60crond: symbolic link to
  ../init.d/crond
</pre>


This reveals that crond found inside init.d is a shell script and
all remaining files found are symbolic links to the crond script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d5a4d0"></a>Modifying chkconfig Entries</h2></div></div><p>Modifying a chkconfig entry is almost as easy as listing the
existing configuration. The form is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig [--level &lt;levels&gt;] &lt;name&gt; &lt;on|off|reset&gt;
</pre><p>For example, if we decide to disable crond for runlevel 2,
the <b  >chkconfig --level 2 crond off</b> command
(executed by root) would turn off crond for the runlevel of 2.
Running <b  >chkconfig --list</b> will confirm that
crond's configuration has been modified. Further, the find command
below reveals that a kill script has replaced the start script in
the rc2.d directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# find /etc/rc.d -name '*crond' -print
/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K60crond
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K60crond
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/K60crond
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S40crond
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K60crond
</pre>


Keep in mind that chkconfig does not automatically disable or
enable a service immediately. It simply changes the symbolic links.
The superuser could disable the crond service immediately with the
command /etc/rc.d/init.d/crond stop. Finally, you can
enable/disable a command for multiple runlevels with one chkconfig
command. For example entering
<pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig --levels 2345 crond on
</pre>


would set up crond to be started for runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d5a7e8"></a>Removing an Entry</h2></div></div><p>At times, removing a service altogether may be in order. Take
sendmail, for example. On client machines where incoming mail for
local accounts is not required, running sendmail as a d&aelig;mon
may not be necessary. In this case, I find disabling sendmail
desirable since it reduces potential security risks. To remove
sendmail from chkconfig, type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig --del sendmail
</pre><p>Below, our find command shows no symbolic links in place,
while the initscript for sendmail remains:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# find /etc/rc.d -name '*sendmail' -print
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail
</pre>


This is perfect in my opinion. The script is left in case sendmail
needs to be re-established as a service, but all symbolic links are
gone. While we could have disabled sendmail for all runlevels, this
would have placed kill scripts in each of the rc*.d subdirectories,
an unnecessary task since sendmail was never launched during the
initialization phase. However, I have seen situations when the
system administrator would manually start a service on certain
occasions. Having the kill scripts in place for that service
ensures a cleanly killed service. So, you make the call.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x1d5a9f8"></a>Adding a chkconfig Entry</h2></div></div><p>So far, so good. We've seen how to view, modify and delete
services using chkconfig. It's time to add a new service. Take the
script named <span   class="bold"><b>oracle</b></span> (see Listing
1).</p><p><a href="4445l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Oracle
Script</a></p><p>Using this script, Oracle 8 can be started with the &ldquo;start&rdquo;
argument and terminated with the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; argument. This meets the
minimum requirements of an initscript that can be used in
conjunction with the launch script /etc/rc.d/rc.</p><p>Place the script in /etc/rc.d/init.d and run (as root)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle
</pre><p>to make the script executable. If you are concerned about
normal users seeing the script, you could try more restrictive file
permissions, as long as the script is executable by root as a
standalone script.
</p><p>Notice the two comments lines in the script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#chkconfig: 2345 80 05
#description: Oracle 8 Server
</pre><p>These lines are needed by chkconfig to determine how to
establish the initial runlevels to add the service as well as set
the priority for the start-and-stop script execution order. These
lines denote the script will start Oracle 8 server for the
runlevels 2, 3, 4 and 5. In addition, the start priority will be
set to 80 while the stop priority will be 05.
</p><p>Now that the script is in place with the appropriate execute
permissions and the required chkconfig comments are in place, we
can add the initscript to the chkconfig configuration by typing, as
root, <b  >chkconfig --add oracle</b>.</p><p>Using chkconfig's query feature, we can verify our
addition:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# chkconfig --list | grep oracle
oracle        0:off     1:off   2:on   3:on   4:on   5:on  6:off
</pre><p>Also, we can type our standard find command to see how
chkconfig set up the symbolic links:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# find /etc/rc.d -name '*oracle' -print
/etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K05oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K05oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K05oracle
</pre>


As requested, the names of the kill links contain the priority 05
while the start links contain 80. If we need to adjust the
priorities, (e.g., our stop priority needs to be 03), simply modify
the chkconfig comment lines in the initscript for oracle and run
the <span   class="bold"><b>reset</b></span> command, as shown below.
The resulting symbolic links will be renamed accordingly:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# chkconfig oracle reset
[root]# find /etc/rc.d -name '*oracle' -print
/etc/rc.d/init.d/oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K03oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K03oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S80oracle
/etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K03oracle
</pre>

<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> was replaced by
<span   class="bold"><b>xinetd</b></span> in Red Hat 7. In addition,
chkconfig functionality has been extended to manage some of the
functionality of xinetd's Internet services. Sample output is shown
below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root]# chkconfig --list
...
xinetd based services:
      finger:  on
      linuxconf-web:  off
      rexec:  off
      rlogin:  off
      rsh:  off
      ntalk:  off
      talk:  off
      telnet:  on
      tftp:  off
      wu-ftpd:   on
</pre><p>To disable a xinetd feature, perhaps finger, you could type
<b  >[root]# chkconfig finger off</b>.
</p><p>Pretty neat, huh? However, there is one &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo;. When the
configuration is changed, the xinetd is signaled automatically to
reload the new configuration with the command /etc/init.d/xinetd
reload, that is executed by chkconfig. This script performs a kill
with the SIGUSR2 signal which instructs xinetd to perform a hard
reconfiguration.</p><p>What does that mean? Well, when I tested it, the active
sessions of services offered through xinetd (i.e., Telnet, FTP,
etc.) were immediately terminated. That might not be a problem for
you, assuming you can plan the best time to disable/enable xinetd
services on your system. As an alternative, you can modify the
/etc/init.d/xinetd script so that the reload option sends a SIGUSR1
signal, which is a soft reconfiguration. This will restart the
services without terminating existing connections.</p><p>Adding xinetd services for chkconfig management is as simple
as adding an xinetd service file into the /etc/xinetd.d directory.
The chkconfig utility will automatically pick it up and make it
available for management through the chkconfig utility.
Neat!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c61580.0x2153748"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Hopefully, you've seen the benefits of Red Hat's chkconfig

simple, the timesaving benefits makes chkconfig an administrator's
