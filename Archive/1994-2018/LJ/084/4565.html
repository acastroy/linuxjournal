file-sharing technology out there, is unfortunately a little
difficult to install and administer. Your intrepid author spent a
weekend with literally no sleep (strong tea and death metal can do
wonders) figuring it out when he first got his hands on it back in
September 2000. Fortunately, Freenet's ease of use has come a long
way since then. With an hour or two of work, anyone competent in
Linux system administration should be able to get their own Freenet
node up and running.
</p><p>The installation of a Java runtime is out of the scope of
this article. However, a list of recommended JDKs (Java Development
Kit) and some warnings about them can be found in the Resources
section.</p><p>If you want to run a full-time, contributing node you'll need
100MHz 486 or greater with at least 32MB of RAM. There are no
minimum requirements (other than about 1MB for the actual software)
for hard drive space, but in this age of 20GB drives, it'd be nice
if you set aside a few GBs for Freenet data. For your internet
connection, a static IP address or dynamic DNS is required.
Anything faster than a dial-up is fine. As for uptime, if your node
is on 24/7 you can contribute (downtimes of up to an hour or so are
okay, but try to avoid anything more than that). Anything less and
your node will still work just fine for you, but you won't be
contributing anything to the network.</p><p>For a part-time, noncontributing node, similar system and
memory requirements apply, but you can use whatever internet
connection you like.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x2177710"></a>Basic Installation</h2></div></div><p>First of all, you need to actually download Freenet. Here you
have two main options. You can download a binary or choose the
source package. If you run Debian, Mr. Bad has created a Debian
package (see Resources). Because Freenet is written in Java, you
don't have to worry about binary compatibility, so it's easiest
simply to download a binary package. After that the question is
which version do you want. A release (current is 0.3.5) or CVS
copy? You'll probably want to go with a release at first. Do make
sure you download the Linux tarball, not the Windows
executable.</p><p>The Linux version of Freenet doesn't have any installation
scripts. Instead you simply untar the tarball into a directory of
your choice. Personally I'd suggest creating a special Freenet user
and putting the Freenet software and data store in the Freenet
user's home directory.</p><p>Next you'll want to make your node automatically start at
boot up. Unfortunately, not all distributions handle the startup
scripts quite the same way. If you want to use d&aelig;montools,
follow the instructions at
<a href="http://freenet.netunify.com/25" target="_self">freenet.netunify.com/25</a>.
Otherwise, use something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su - -c "cd ~/freenet ; rm freenet.log nohup.out ; nohup ./freenet_server &amp; &gt;/dev/null" freenet
</pre><p>This changes the user to the Freenet user. The &ldquo;-&rdquo; sets the
environment to that of a login shell so the environment is set up
as though running from a normal shell. Finally, the command -c
changes the directory to the Freenet directory, removes old log
files and runs the Freenet server in nohup mode directing any
non-errors to /dev/null. You'll need to insure the Java program
itself is in your path. Try running Java from a room shell to test
this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x21779d0"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The Freenet node software uses two configuration files:
.freenetrc, the configuration for the node; and .fproxyrc, the
configuration for the fproxy module. Of the two, .freenetrc
contains all but one of the options; .fproxyrc just tells fproxy
which Freenet node it should connect to.</p><p>The first thing you'll want to set is the transient option up
at the top of the .freenetrc file. The default, &ldquo;no&rdquo;, means that
your node will tell other nodes about its existence. This is
probably what you want if you plan on running a 24/7 node with a
good internet connection and a static IP address or dynamic DNS
service. If you set transient to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, your node won't tell
other nodes about its existence. If you have spotty uptime, a slow
internet connection or a dynamic IP address without dynamic DNS,
set transient to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</p><p>You'll want to change the port used by Freenet to a random
port between 5,000 and 65,535. If everyone ran their node on the
same port it would be far easier for Freenet to be filtered out,
which is not a good thing. To do this, change the listenPort value
in .freenetrc and the serverAddress in .fproxyrc to reflect the new
port. Also, remember to use the -serverAddress option when running
the command-line clients or set the FREENET environment variable to
the address of your node.</p><p>If you have a dynamic IP address but use dynamic DNS you can
still contribute to Freenet by setting nodeAddress to your dynamic
DNS name. Instead of telling other Freenet nodes the IP address of
your machine, it will tell them the address in the nodeAddress
setting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x2177be0"></a>Resource Configuration</h2></div></div><p>By default, Freenet will store a maximum of 1,000 items in
the data store and use a maximum of 500MB of hard drive space. The
diskCache and dataStoreSize options control this. Note that, due to
bugs, the actual amount of space used can easily go over this.
Often files in the data store simply get lost and don't get deleted
when they should be. Restarting the node periodically, every day or
week, will clean out those lost files. Secondly, while transferring
large files the node will store the whole file while it's in
transit even if doing so makes the node go over the size limit.
Hopefully by the time you read this article, these bugs will have
been fixed, though the second problem is difficult to fix for
various reasons.</p><p>After that we have the dataPath and dataPropertiesPath that
control where the data store is (the default is the .freenet
directory where you installed Freenet). The difference between the
two is that dataPath is where the actual data gets put, and
dataPropertiesPath controls is where the .inf files describing the
data stored get put. In all but unusual cases the two will be the
same value. You may want to set this path to another partition with
more space available than the default. Any filesystem that supports
long filenames is fine. Note that you can't use multiple partitions
simultaneously, you'll have to run multiple nodes on different
ports for that.</p><p>There is also an option to limit bandwidth used,
bandwidthLimit. This limit applies to outgoing data only. Incoming
data is not limited (see maximumConnectionThreads). For most people
the 50K/sec limit is probably fine, but if you can, please increase
it or disable the bandwidthLimit to about a third to a half of your
outgoing bandwidth, about 50K/sec to 300K/sec for your average
cable or DSL line. Note that the bandwidth limit does not apply to
requests originating from the same machine.</p><p>Incoming bandwidth can be limited, to a degree, with the
maximumConnectionThreads option. This option limits the maximum
number of incoming connections from other nodes. Changing this
changes the amount of bandwidth and memory used. Most people can
probably leave it at its default of 50K/sec, but if you have memory
restrictions (or excesses) you can reduce or increase it.</p><p>Note that there is currently no way to limit the amount of
total data transfer in a given time period. So as of yet, there is
no way to only allow, for example, 1GB of data transfer per
month.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x2177e48"></a>Other Options</h2></div></div><p>At the end of the configuration file are the options that
control logging. A single log file is used, freenet.log, by default
(controlled by logFile). The logging option controls the threshold
of events logged. The default, &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, doesn't log any of the
mundane details of your node sending and receiving data. The
&ldquo;minor&rdquo; setting can often provide useful debugging information,
however debugging is overkill. Setting logging to minor is probably
your best bet.</p><p>Finally, there is one last option that's not in the default
configuration file, informDelay. Before writing the node's address
to informURL, the node will wait a default of 24 hours to make sure
your node is stable. Your node must be running for 24 continuous
hours before the informURL is notified. Initially, one of the big
problems with the informURL system was that people would try
Freenet for a few minutes, decide it wasn't worth it and remove the
Freenet software. Meanwhile, the address of their nonfunctioning
node was sent to informURL. When nodes tried to get a working
address, almost every single address in informURL would be
nonfunctioning. It got to the point where one of the big problems
in getting a node up and running was finding another node!</p><p>If you plan on restarting your node once a day you'll have to
change the informDelay to something different. Setting it to 0 by
adding the line <b  >informDelay = 0</b> to the
configuration file will disable the feature and is what you want.
Otherwise don't touch informDelay, please!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x2178058"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>Now that you've got your node up and running you want to see
if it works, right? First try running:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
freenet_request test-key
</pre><p>If that works you'll see the message:
<b  >Congratulations! You've fetched a Freenet key</b> on
the console after some debugging information. If it doesn't do
anything for more then two minutes or so it's not working.
</p><p>Next try the URL http://localhost:8081/KSK@Aardvark in your
favorite web browser to see if fproxy is working. If it is, you'll
see the page of Aardvark's Freenet Index come up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x21782c0"></a>Establishing Your Node</h2></div></div><p>Actually getting your node established in the network can be
a little tricky. It should, and usually will, do so automatically,
but it often helps to push the process along a little to speed it
up. This <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> an optional procedure. There are
two main parts to this: finding other nodes and getting known by
other nodes. Note that if you're running a transient node the
second part isn't important.</p><p>The first part is simple, use Freenet. Just take a look at
some of the content, such as the above-mentioned Aardvark's Freenet
Index (KSK@Aardvark) and gj's web page
(KSK@webpages/gj_jump0).</p><p>The second part is a little bit harder. You can insert a
random chunk of data (1K) into Freenet with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=1 | freenet_insert -length 1024 CHK@
</pre><p>When your node inserts that data, other nodes will find out
about your node from the SourceAddress on the packets of data.
</p><p>In any case, remember that it will take a few days before
your node becomes known and other nodes start to request data from
you. So if nothing much seems to be happening&mdash;don't panic!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x207f580.0x21785d8"></a>Day-to-Day Administration</h2></div></div><p>Properly set up, a Freenet node shouldn't need any ongoing
administration. However, there are a few automatable tasks that
need to be done. First of all, the log files need to be rotated.
Secondly, you'll want to restart the Freenet software periodically.
Currently the disk (and I believe memory) usage of Freenet tends to
balloon unless you restart your node periodically. Both rotating
the log files, which requires restarting the node anyway, and
restarting the node can be easily done with the script
restart_script (shown in Listing 1). For your average node,
restarting once a week should be fine.</p><p><a href="4565l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.

precompiled and works, plus it's one of the faster JDKs out there.
On the downside it's proprietary and requires registration to
download. Both tarball and Red Hat RPMs are available at:
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/java/jdk/linux130/index.html" target="_self">www.ibm.com/java/jdk/linux130/index.html</a>.</p><p>Kaffe, the OpenSource JDK, is another, more difficult option.
You will have to compile in gmp support, something most
distributions don't do in their Kaffe packages. A Debian package
for Kaffe with gmp support is available from Mr. Bad's site, above.
Otherwise, compile from anonymous CVS or a source package to which
you apply the patch found in the Freenet README. Make sure you
enable gmp support with the --enable-gmp option when you run
./configure.</p><p><a href="4565s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
