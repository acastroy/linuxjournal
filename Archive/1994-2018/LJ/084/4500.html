    Usenet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c6240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Who ever said that Usenet is dead? It
most certainly is not. Even though Usenet has changed its face over
the last, say, ten years, the simple idea of exchanging ideas and
having discussions among a large number of people by posting
articles on a global messageboard has perpetuated. Yes, for those
of you who still don't know what this is all about, we are talking
about newsgroups, an important part of the Internet, albeit one
heavily neglected by the media who usually equate Internet with
Word Wide Web. The spread of the Internet, the increased
availability to more and more households, has not only influenced
the way we shop, trade stocks, etc., but has also transformed the
old messageboard system of Usenet. But rest assured, no matter how
much things have changed over the last few years, Usenet is still a
strange place.
</p><p>This strange place has, for a long time, been regarded as
inhabited only by full-time geeks, nerds with Coke-bottle glasses
trying to download obviously fake pictures of naked celebrities
when they are not busy discussing the technological details of the
Starship Enterprise's Warp-Drive.</p><p>But while these people certainly exist, there is another side
to Usenet: with more and more people getting on the Internet it is
true that on the one hand the signal-to-noise ratio has been
lowered, which is why some people might say that &ldquo;Usenet is
dead&rdquo;. On the other hand, more and more people are exchanging
ideas, helping each other out and having highly interesting
discussions that take place every day in this community. If you
invest a little time, I'm sure I can convince you that Usenet is
quite alive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c63f8"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>The history of Usenet is so closely linked to the history of
the Internet itself and the history of UNIX (and thus Linux) that
it is worth while to spend some time finding out how things
started. Let's take a trip back to the year 1976 (a good year, I
might add)--the place, how could it be any different, AT&amp;T Bell
Laboratories, where a new utility called &ldquo;UNIX To UNIX Copy
Program&rdquo; (UUCP) had just been developed. UUCP was designed as a
simple and efficient way of copying files between computers via
phonelines, and while nowadays UUCP has been superseded by TCP/IP
based protocols, it provided the foundation for what became known
as &ldquo;the poor man's ARPANet&rdquo;.</p><p>ARPANet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), created
by the US Department of Defense in 1969, was originally limited to
computer scientists with Department of Defense contracts&mdash;not
everybody could just go &ldquo;willy-nilly over the ARPANet&rdquo;. Aside
from these connections, in order to join ARPANet one needed quite a
bit of cash&mdash;assumed numbers ranged up to $100,000.</p><p>In 1979, two Duke University grad students started using UUCP
to enable people to exchange information by uploading (posting) a
message to a designated subject area called a newsgroup. Following
a simple bulletin-board approach, subsequent messages would appear
in the same newsgroup and messages regarding other topics would
appear in a different newsgroup. This message system became known
as Usenet News (UNIX Users Network). Using UUCP, everybody, even
poor students, were able to use this system without being connected
to the ARPANet.</p><p>The shell-scripts used by these two students, Tom Truscott
and Jim Ellis, were later rewritten in C for public distribution
and named the &ldquo;A&rdquo; release of news. If you consider how much
traffic goes through an average full-feed newsserver nowadays, it
is amusing to know that this A release was designed for not more
than a few articles per group per day.</p><p>This small number of messages posted each day evolved into
what became its own culture of shared information and support as
more and more groups of core sites were linked together. In the
year 1981, UUCP and ARPANet, up until then still independent, were
linked together by Berknet (at the University of California at
Berkeley). Other universities and colleges developed their own
networks, such as BITnet (Because It's Time net&mdash;a geek's affection
for witty acronyms has a long tradition), which was based on the
IBM protocol and developed by Yale and the City University of New
York.</p><p>As these various networks were linked together, Usenet had
the form of a graph, and Network maps were drawn. The news software
was rewritten and became the &ldquo;B&rdquo; release. Networks were developed
and linked, and in brief, things were changing quickly. More and
more forums were established, and it became clear that more
structure was needed&mdash;it was time for the Great Renaming.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4500f1.large.jpg"><img src="4500f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. An Early Map of Usenet, ca.
1980</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c68c8"></a>The Great Renaming</h2></div></div><p>The first forums, or newsgroups, to be established were
net.xxxx, and dept.xxxx; several mailing lists from the ARPANet
that fed into this UNIX Users Network formed the &ldquo;fa&rdquo; hierarchy.
As traffic increased, several hierarchies were instantiated, and
Usenet was now connecting people all over the globe. However,
transmission was still very expensive, so that universities in
Europe were not willing to pay for &ldquo;the fluff groups like
net.religion and net.flame&rdquo;. A new hierarchy, the &ldquo;talk.*&rdquo;
hierarchy was proposed, and the Great Renaming began.</p><p>In the time between 1986 and 1987, the main top hierarchies
were created, including comp, misc, news, rec, sci, soc and talk.
Brian Reid, as many other Usenet users, was still not quite happy
with this structure&mdash;the Backbone Cabal, for example, was unwilling
to create rec.drugs and planned on dropping net.flame. In 1987,
Brian Reid came up with the idea for an alternative distribution
system that would not use these backbone links, creating the new
top-level hierarchy &ldquo;alt.*&rdquo;; alt.sex and alt.rock-n-roll followed
a year later:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>To end the suspense, I have just created alt.sex.
That meant that the alt network now carried alt.sex and alt.drugs.
It was therefore artistically necessary to create alt.rock-n-roll,
which I have also done. I have no idea what sort of traffic it will
carry. If the bizzarroids take it over I will rmgroup it or
moderate it; otherwise I will let it be.  &mdash;Brian Reid</p></blockquote></div><p>Eventually, with the advent of the TCP/IP based Network News
Transport Protocol (NNTP) all these groups were also transmitted to
Europe and all over the world. Fewer people were using UUCP; NNTP
became more and more popular; the Internet itself spread around the
globe; Backbone Cabal became more and more silent and eventually
was declared dead. Usenet, however, was quite alive and thriving,
attracting more and more people every day&mdash;ultimately leading to
what some old-timers refer to as &ldquo;the September that never
ended&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c6b30"></a>The September That Never Ended</h2></div></div><p>During the late 80s and early 90s, Usenet became quite
popular, especially more so, quite understandably, among students.
Every year in September when semesters started and Freshmen got
access to the Internet, many so-called &ldquo;newbies&rdquo; did not bother
to follow the Netiquette but started posting to the various groups
in rude and inexperienced ways. In the days before 1993 the
majority of people on Usenet were regulars, following the
newsgroups for years and (sometimes more, sometimes less) willing
to help out newcomers, teaching them Netiquette. But in 1993 AOL
gave Usenet-Access to its customers, opening the doors for a flood
of technically inexperienced newbies to swamp the forums
demonstrating (sometimes more, sometimes less) firmly that they did
not know how to deal with this new medium, and much worse, they
demonstrated limited willingness to learn. Some people insist that
ever since that September in 1993 the overall quality of
discussions in Usenet has gone down.</p><p>It is hard to deny that the merging of two such different
groups of people, the tech-savvy geeks and the average Joe-Sixpack
with an AOL-account led to conflicts and changed the way of the
discussions held in the various newsgroups. However, this did not
mean the end of Usenet, as some old-timers would have it&mdash;in the
end, all it meant was a larger variety of opinions to be discussed.
More groups were created, old silent groups deleted and new
structures laid in. For every possible topic nowadays there is a
newsgroup; all one needs to do is take a look at the impressive
hierarchy of Usenet to get an idea how information is flowing
around the globe and into everybody's home.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c6c90"></a>Hierarchy</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, Usenet is structured hierarchically.
The main top-level hierarchies are alt, comp, misc, news, rec, sci,
soc and talk. Furthermore, there are hierarchies for each country,
the country code of which precedes the international equivalent.
For example, de.comp.os.linux.misc would be the German speaking
equivalent to comp.os.linux.misc, just as fr.comp.lang.c is the
French equivalent to comp.lang.c. In addition to the country (or
rather language) specific newsgroups, there are now a large variety
of other top-level hierarchies such as free.*, gnu.* and news.*, as
well as commercial or &ldquo;company-related&rdquo; newsgroups.</p><p>The &ldquo;Master List of all Newsgroup Hierarchies&rdquo; is available
at
<a href="http://faqs.org/faqs/usenet/hierarchy-list" target="_self">faqs.org/faqs/usenet/hierarchy-list</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c6e48"></a>Restructuring</h2></div></div><p>These hierarchies are highly functional and very well
structured. Occasionally, however, some restructuring is necessary.
If one discussion group, for example, becomes overwhelmed with too
many question about a certain topic, the group may split into
foo.general (or foo.misc) and foo.bar. If such a decision needs to
be made, a posting is sent into this group as well as related
groups to call for a vote. Every person reading the newsgroup can
then cast his or her vote for or against the creation of another,
more specific group&mdash;a very democratic process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c6f50"></a>Different Kinds of Newsgroups</h2></div></div><p>Because every newsgroup has its own Charta, in which the
purpose and the topic of this group is clearly stated, it is easy
to post your article to the right group. Furthermore, this Charta
specifies the rules that apply to the particular group. For
example, it is generally frowned upon to send HTML-formatted
postings into Usenet; however, a Charta may indicate that this
behavior is acceptable or even desired in a certain
newsgroup.</p><p>Some newsgroups are moderated, meaning that the posts are not
posted to the group directly, but rather to a person (or a group of
people) who is in charge of filtering out noise and inappropriate
posts. Anything that is not on topic in these newsgroups, anything
that is of offensive nature or anything that already has been
answered in the newsgroup or in its Charta or FAQ, is weeded out by
the moderator(s) and will not appear in the group.</p><p>The third kind of newsgroup is the private newsgroup. These
may or may not be moderated, or have specific rules, but in general
the only difference from the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; newsgroups is that they are
not available on all news servers, and only certain people have
access to these groups. Most universities have some local
newsgroups that can only be accessed from within the local network;
the same goes for some ISPs. Other companies, for example, sell a
certain service and restrict the access to their full-feed to
paying customers only.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c7108"></a>Newsreader</h2></div></div><p>Since network news articles certainly resemble mail messages
(or e-mail), many people think of them as being the same, which is
why they often request a program that handles mail and news instead
of looking for one single program for each of these rather
different tasks. A news article is broadcasted to all interested
hosts by the news server, which keeps one local copy for a certain
amount of time, before it expires. This type of article contains a
lot of important information in its headers, among them the unique
Message ID identifying each article and the Message IDs of the
articles it refers to (see Resources), if any.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c7210"></a>GNKSA</h2></div></div><p>The structure of Usenet and the way these articles are copied
from news server to news server require the posting agent to be as
standards-conforming as possible. To ensure that a newsreader
follows the standards, The Good Net Keeping Seal of Approval
(GNKSA), a document intended to describe minimal standards for
decent Net behavior, was created. It specifies the requirements a
good news client should meet, some of which are rather essential,
others of which are merely a very good idea.</p><p>Note, however, that this is no official document, and that
there are plenty of newsreaders out there that do not carry this
Seal and may still be functional. In general, a newsreader should
follow all of GNKSA's musts&mdash;otherwise broken postings might be
generated.</p><p>While the content of the article is certainly in the hands of
the user, the posting agent must ensure that it does everything
possible to create standards-compliant postings and does not
encourage behavior that is considered to be bad Netiquette (see
below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c73c8"></a>List of Newsreaders</h2></div></div><p>The question as to which is the best newsreader cannot be
answered. It would be equivalent to asking which Linux distribution
is the best. It all depends on your personal preference: some
people prefer a GUI, while others are die-hard,
command-line-interface fans. The following is an alphabetical list
of the most common newsreaders available for Linux:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Gnus: http://www.gnus.org/</p></li><li><p>knews: http://www.matematik.su.se/ kjj/</p></li><li><p>Netscape Communicator:

http://www.mit.edu/people/jik/software/xrn.html</p></li></ul></div><p>To evaluate each and every one of these newsreaders would
certainly go beyond the scope of this article; however, I feel that
I should point out a few brief details about some of these
applications. For a more detailed discussion of the various
newsreaders see Resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16c7b00"></a>Gnus</h2></div></div><p>For all of you hard-core (X)Emacs fans out there, you
probably already made your decision: this is the Newsreader for
you. From all of the above listed applications, this is the only
one that combines News and Mail in one application and can still be
recommended without any reservations. It is highly configurable and
written in Emacs LISP for GNU Emacs and XEmacs.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4500f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. A Screenshot of Gnus</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16be6a8"></a>Pan</h2></div></div><p>Pan is a very powerful gtk/gnome-based newsreader. It can be
used in off-line mode as well as in online-mode, which makes it
very attractive to the poor souls out there not using DSL or a
Cable-Modem. It recently scored the highest GNKS rating of all
UNIX/Linux newsreaders and simplifies downloading binaries by
automatically grouping together multipart binary attachments and
support of multiple connections.</p><p>The developers at Superpimp are focusing on creating a
functional GUI newsreader that still can be operated entirely with
the keyboard. The compliance with all of GNKSA's rules (at the time
of this writing, Pan would receive a perfect score if re-evaluated)
ensures that the user does not accidently create a broken
posting.</p><p>One of the most important things about Pan is its exemplary
development: daily CVS snapshots are available for everybody who is
interested; developers are actively following the users mailing
list and submitted bug reports and patches are considered and/or
applied within days. It is a great example of how and why open
source works.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4500f3.large.jpg"><img src="4500f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. A Screenshot of Pan</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bea70"></a>Slrn</h2></div></div><p>Slrn (&ldquo;s-lang read news&rdquo;) is a text-interfaced newsreader,
very similar in appearance to mutt. It has been ported to a large
variety of operating systems and can be easily extended using the
s-lang macro language. If you don't need or don't want to use a
GUI, this is most certainly the fastest and most functional console
newsreader you can get. For example the many configuration options
offered through the s-lang macro language make it more customizable
than Pan.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4500f4.large.jpg"><img src="4500f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. A Screenshot of Slrn</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bed88"></a>Netiquette</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.&rdquo; While this
certainly is true, there are a few simple rules that everybody
should follow. These rules are referred to as Netiquette (from
network etiquette), and they ensure that Usenet does not drown in
noise. Even though you may ask yourself in the beginning why things
should be a certain way, rest assured that once you spend some time
on Usenet, you will understand and appreciate these rules.</p><p>One thing to always keep in mind is that Usenet is not a free
support service, but people having discussions in their free time.
If you have a question and you get it answered quickly, remember
this.</p><p>What it boils down to is basically common sense and common
courtesy. One of the core-rules of Netiquette is to always remember
the human on the other side. All other rules follow logically as
long as you keep this in mind.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bef40"></a>Finding the Right Newsgroup</h2></div></div><p>Of course it is important to find the correct newsgroup for
your question&mdash;not only would it be quite unlikely that somebody in
japan.animal.penguin might know the answer to a networking-related
question, it is also considered rude to post off-topic messages
into a newsgroup.</p><p>In order to make it easier for people to find the right
newsgroup to post their message to, almost all newsreaders are able
to show you a brief summary: a one line description of most groups
when you subscribe to a newsgroup. However, occasionally you might
want to subscribe to a newsgroup without having to search through
the list of all groups available on your server. Since all Linux
newsreaders use the same file format to keep track of the available
and subscribed groups, it is easy to search through this file
(~/.newsrc in general) for a specific newsgroup using grep or
egrep.</p><p>For example, say you wish to find a list of all
Linux-specific groups from the &ldquo;alt&rdquo; or &ldquo;comp&rdquo;
hierarchy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
egrep '^(comp|alt).*linux' ~/.newsrc | more
</pre><p>If you want to see the list of groups regarding news-related
software and announcements, you might try
<pre     class="programlisting">
egrep '^news (soft|announce)' ~/.newsrc | more
</pre>


Since egrep supports regular expressions, you can refine your
search as narrowly or widely as needed. This way of searching for
specific newsgroups may come in handy if you want to hint to
another poster that he might be getting more qualified responses in
another newsgroup, one that you are not subscribed to.
</p><p>Before you start posting into a newsgroup, it is generally
considered a good idea to</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>read the Charta</p></li><li><p>read the FAQ for this newsgroup if it exists</p></li><li><p>follow the group for a few days</p></li></ul></div><p>This way you get an idea of what the general tone in this
newsgroup is or if your question has been answered already or is
even part of the FAQ. In addition, it is also generally expected
that you searched through a news archive like Deja.com before you
post into the group. Remember, Usenet is not free tech support!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bf518"></a>Subject, From and Quoting</h2></div></div><p>It is important to remember that some people are reading
hundreds and hundreds of messages each day; most likely, they are
best qualified to help you out, so you want to make it easy for
them to read your posts. Many people just read through the subject
lines and determine from there, if they are going to to read the
entire article, so try to keep the subject line short but
significant. &ldquo;HELP!&rdquo; is a bad, bad example. Remember that writing
in all caps is considered to be screaming; furthermore, &ldquo;multiple
exclamation marks are a sure sign of a sick mind.&rdquo;</p><p>As mentioned above, nobody knows who you are, and sometimes
you may not even want to reveal your identity. However, many people
prefer answering questions when asked politely by somebody with a
real name. Your name is like your outer appearance in
cyberspace&mdash;if you post under the name &ldquo;K3wl d00d&rdquo;, your postings
might not be taken seriously. Likewise, if you choose a rather
offensive name, people might killfile you right away, without even
looking at your posts. Just use your real name and your real e-mail
address.</p><p>When you reply to another message, quote only the relevant
portions of the message you are replying to. Don't quote the whole
message if it is not necessary; especially delete previous
signatures. Be careful to not misattribute something. Leave in the
attribution line that most newsreaders provide. Observe the
attribution lines and read posts carefully. Replied text goes below
the quoted text! For a more detailed discussion on the &ldquo;Art of
Quoting&rdquo;, see Resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bf6d0"></a>Attachments</h2></div></div><p>Many people are still using a dial-up connection to connect
to the Internet. These people are literally paying for every byte
of information that goes through their modem. Let this be just one
reason why you should never ever post an attachment into a
newsgroup that does not specifically state in its Charta that it is
desired. Usually, attachments are only appropriate in the
*binaries* newsgroups.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bf7d8"></a>Signatures</h2></div></div><p>Once you have spent some time on Usenet, you will see that
many people have a signature that is appended to every posting.
Some people use it to provide, for example, a link to their web
site, others have a funny quote in it. If you want to have a
signature, keep in mind that there are rules for these, too: first
of all, a signature should not be any longer than four lines. This
is again an argument of bandwidth. As your article is copied
hundreds and hundreds of times, one more line does make a
difference. Why four? Why not five? Well, basically, because. The
original purpose of the signature file was to provide your business
information. There has to be a limit somewhere; since, generally
speaking, all information such as an address, phone number and
e-mail address can fit into four lines, it's four.</p><p>Another thing about the signature is the correct delimiter.
Usually, your newsreader will provide the correct delimiter itself,
but in case you want to supply your own, please notice that the
only correct delimiter is &ldquo;&shy;&rdquo;. The delimiter (or &ldquo;sigdash&rdquo;)
allows other programs to recognize when the body of your message is
finished and where the sig begins&mdash;this is useful for automatically
removing the sig when quoting for a followup, as well as coloring
it a different color, archiving and various other things.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bf938"></a>Randomized Signatures</h2></div></div><p>Many people use their signature not to provide their contact
information, but rather to express their individuality to a certain
extent; after all, it's called their signature. While you may often
find short ASCII-art, or a link to the owner's home page in the
signature, many people use shell scripts ranging from very simple
to rather elaborate to generate a unique and/or funny signature for
every post they send. For example, you will always be able to
impress a newbie by having your signature display the current
uptime of your Linux box or feed it with some quotes from the
popular &ldquo;fortune&rdquo; program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
echo -e "Cheers,  n Yourname  n  n- " &gt; ~/.signature

</pre><p>Just make sure you use the -s switch for fortune&mdash;otherwise
your signature might get too long. To make your signature even more
individual, you might want to create a few fortune files yourself
and specify them in the script. Then put this script into your
crontab and run it every, say, five minutes.

and follow the Netiquette. Every now and then you will find that
some people enjoy lurking around in newsgroups and posting
offensive material and/or rude replies. It's usually a good idea to
simply ignore these people&mdash;a task that can easily be automatically
accomplished by your newsreader. Most (if not all) Linux-based
newsreaders provide the capability of assigning different levels of
importance to the different articles, depending on various criteria
such as Author, Number of Lines, Subject, etc. The act of deleting
a certain person's articles is referred to as &ldquo;killfiling&rdquo;, while
other actions (such as highlighting, sorting by importance, marking
as &ldquo;read&rdquo; while still displaying the article, etc.) are referred
to as &ldquo;scoring&rdquo;. Again Gnus, Pan and Slrn stand out among the
other readers with respect to this capability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bfc50"></a>E-mail Munging</h2></div></div><p>A more severe drawback from posting to newsgroups is that you
expose your e-mail address to the world, and special spiders or
bots are harvesting high traffic newsgroups for e-mail addresses,
resulting in increased Spam in your mailbox. It is important to
provide a valid e-mail address in some way when posting to Usenet,
so that people can reply if you desire. Many people are &ldquo;munging&rdquo;
their e-mail address or are simply entering an invalid address in
the From-Header and a short note in their signature explaining how
to retrieve the original valid e-mail address.</p><p>However, one should not simply use an invalid e-mail address
because this way it either puts more of a load on one's system or
on the originating mailserver. In general, it is considered polite
to use only the suffix &ldquo;.invalid&rdquo; for your e-mail address, so as
to make it clear that your address is in fact not a genuine
one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ce580.0x16bfdb0"></a>From Here on</h2></div></div><p>As you can, did and/or will see, Usenet is a very interesting
place to spend some (plenty? all?) of your free time. But it is
also a particularly large place&mdash;a topic that can hardly be covered
adequately within limited space. In this article I tried to give an
overview over the main aspects of Usenet, touching various topics
only briefly.</p><p>Some topics that are of particular interest and that need
further, more detailed attention include real spam protection
through a mail-filtering program such as procmail, and the
installation and maintenance of a local newsserver such as leafnode
(for a small local network) or inn (for a full-blown professional
network or newsservice). Since these topics are too extensive to be
covered on here, I might elaborate on them in future
articles.</p><p>In the mean time, I would like to encourage the reader to
follow the referenced links and, of course, explore Usenet
themselves so. But remember: &ldquo;This game lends itself to certain
abuses.&rdquo;--Bill Watterson's Calvin</p><p><a href="4500s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
