    Simple ways to build web applications using servlets.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x257d558"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I began to write server-side web
applications, there were two mainstream choices: if you wanted the
program to execute quickly, you chose C, and if you wanted to write
the program quickly, you used Perl. C, as we all know, is great
when the binary needs to be small, fast and efficient. But C's lack
of automatic memory management and decent string handling, along
with the extreme care that programmers need in order to use it,
made it a poor second choice when compared with Perl.
</p><p>But in the last few years, a number of programming languages
have begun to challenge Perl for the server-side web programming
mantle. In particular, Python has gained significant ground, thanks
in no small part to the growth of the Zope web development
environment.</p><p>But perhaps the largest groundswell of server-side
programming is coming from the Java community. Java, as many of us
might remember, began life as a client-side programming language.
For the most part, applets are an unpleasant memory of what happens
when you try to mix two client-side paradigms&mdash;a lesson that the
increasingly common use of Flash seems to ignore.</p><p>The basic unit of server-side Java is the
<span   class="bold"><b>servlet</b></span>, a small program that is
executed in response to an HTTP request and that generates a legal
HTTP response. Since servlets are written in Java, they are written
as object classes, inherit from a servlet ancestor and can take
advantage of Java's threading and exception handling. Moreover,
servlets (like all Java programs) run inside of a Java virtual
machine (JVM), an abstraction layer that can run on any operating
platform. This means that the same servlets can run on nearly any
operating system, providing even greater portability than CGI
programs.</p><p>I have used servlets in a small number of projects so far,
but this number is rising rapidly. Java is now the &ldquo;in&rdquo; language.
This is partly because Sun has invested a large amount in its
marketing, partly because it offers some technological and
infrastructural advantages over its rivals and also because it
poses a serious platform challenge to Windows. In addition,
server-side Java is the cornerstone for an increasing number of
Java-based application servers.</p><p>This month, we will begin to explore Java as a server-side
programming language. As a beginning step, we will install the
Jakarta-Tomcat environment for running servlets, as well as the
associated Jasper environment for creating Java Server Pages
(JSPs). In coming months, we will look at how to connect our
servlets and JSPs to a relational database, as well as how to use
Enterprise JavaBeans and the Enhydra application server for an even
more powerful environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x257d870"></a>Installing Java</h2></div></div><p>When I first started to work with Java on Linux a few years
ago, the situation seemed fairly grim: while Linux was the best
known, open-source operating system, and Sun was promoting Java as
a universal programming language, it was difficult to impossible to
get a good version of Java for Linux. Some volunteer porting
efforts, particularly the one done by the Blackdown porters, were
impressive, but installation was prone to problems and not nearly
as stable as developers might have liked.</p><p>As I write this article in January 2001, the situation has
changed dramatically: you can now download a Linux version of the
latest Java development kit (JDK) directly from Sun's web site.
Further, the Tomcat servlet/JSP system works just fine on Linux. As
Linux picks up more steam, it is becoming an increasingly
attractive platform on which to program in Java.</p><p>Because my main Linux box runs Red Hat 6.2, I downloaded the
JDK 1.3 RPM from Sun's web site,
<a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_self">http://java.sun.com/</a>. In
order to download the JDK, I had to sign up as a member of the
&ldquo;Java Developer Connection&rdquo;; while I'm not thrilled by the notion
of having to register in order to download software, it does not
seem like a terrible price to pay. The RPM cannot be installed
directly; first, you must agree to Sun's Java licensing
agreement.</p><p>Once you have accepted the agreement, the RPM is unpacked and
made available for install. You can then log in as root and install
the JDK, which is placed in the /usr/java directory. By putting
/usr/java/jdk1.3/bin/ in your PATH environment variable, you can
execute the <span   class="bold"><b>javac</b></span> compiler and the
java runtime environment without having to specify an explicit
path.</p><p>Once you have installed the JDK, you should run at least one
simple test to ensure that it works. Listing 1 contains a simple
program that can be invoked without any parameters and prints
&ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; to STDOUT. If the program is passed through any
parameters, it prints those parameters separated by a pipe
character (|).</p><p><a href="4576l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Test.java</a></p><p>To compile our test class (Test.java) into bytecodes
(Test.class), use the Java compiler, javac:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
javac Test.java
</pre><p>To run the program, we must invoke the Java runtime
environment (java), giving it the name of our class (without the
.class suffix):
<pre     class="programlisting">
java Test
</pre>


If we don't pass any arguments, we get the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello, world
</pre>


We can, however, pass arguments to our program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
java Test a b "q r s" 123
</pre>


In this case, we get the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a|b|q r s|123
</pre>


In addition to setting your PATH correctly, you should set the
environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to the location of the JDK.
If you use <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>, you can simply
put the following line inside one of your startup files:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.3
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x257df50"></a>Installing Jakarta-Tomcat</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have installed the JDK, we can install
Jakarta-Tomcat. Jakarta is the overall name for Java-related
projects sponsored by the Apache Software Foundation, and Tomcat is
the ASF's project for servlets and JSPs. (JSPs, as we will see next
month, are simply an easy way to create servlets.) Tomcat is meant
to be the reference standard for servlets and JSPs on a variety of
platforms, making it portable and easy to use Java in server-side
web applications.</p><p>Unlike a CGI program, which executes within its own UNIX
process, and unlike a mod_perl handler, which executes as a
subroutine within Apache, servlets execute within a Java virtual
machine. This JVM is known as a &ldquo;servlet container&rdquo; and can be
the server itself (if the server is written in Java), embedded
inside of the server or external to the server.</p><p>This article assumes that you will be using Apache, in which
case the servlet container is external to the HTTP server. However,
Tomcat is itself a full-fledged HTTP server, meaning that we can
conduct some initial tests without having to configure Apache at
all.</p><p>You can download and install the latest version of Tomcat
from the Jakarta web site at
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org" target="_self">http://jakarta.apache.org/</a>.
The Jakarta Project distributes software for a variety of platforms
and on a number of schedules, in both source and binary formats. It
may take a bit of looking, but you should be able to find a
downloadable binary of the latest stable Tomcat release for Linux.
As of this writing, the most recent stable version of Tomcat is
3.2.1, which I downloaded in the file
jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1.tar.gz.</p><p>Once downloaded onto your computer, change to the directory
where you want to install Tomcat, and open it up:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/java
tar -zxvf jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1.tar.gz
</pre><p>Your /usr/java directory will now contain two subdirectories,
one named jdk1.3 and the other jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1.
</p><p>Just as you had to set JAVA_HOME to indicate where your Java
distribution is located, you must also set the TOMCAT_HOME variable
to indicate where Tomcat was installed. Those using bash can add
the following line to one of their startup files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export TOMCAT_HOME=/usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1
</pre><p>If you are planning to write your own servlets, you will also
need to tell Java where to look for the servlet-related classes.
These are located in a Java archive (.jar) file,
$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/servlet.jar. If you use bash and don't otherwise
set your CLASSPATH, you can set it as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export CLASSPATH=$TOMCAT_HOME/lib/servlet.jar:.
</pre>


You don't need to modify CLASSPATH in this way if you are only
planning to run servlets that other people have written. The
runtime Java servlet engine knows where to look for the appropriate
.jar files, and its CLASSPATH is set correctly when you install
Tomcat.
</p><p>Once you have performed all of these steps, Tomcat is ready
to go. You can start it up using the shell script under
$TOMCAT_HOME/bin:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh
</pre><p>A number of diagnostic messages will appear on the screen.
However, the main servlet.log log file is normally in
$TOMCAT_HOME/logs.
</p><p>You can check to see if Tomcat works by pointing your browser
at port 8080 (the default) on the computer where it has been
started. In other words, http://localhost:8080/ should give you a
welcome message, indicating that &ldquo;this is the Tomcat default home
page&rdquo; with some additional links to examples of servlets and JSPs
installed on the system. The example servlets should execute
correctly, providing you with a demonstration of some simple tasks
that we can perform with Tomcat.</p><p>Servlet classes are normally installed under a directory
named WEB-INF, underneath the directory named in the URL; that is,
the example servlet RequestInfoExample, which comes with Tomcat, is
available at
http://localhost:8080/examples/servlet/RequestInfoExample.</p><p>The actual Java .class file (as well as the .java source file
for that class) is stored in
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/RequestInfoExample.class.</p><p>We will soon see how to configure additional directories for
servlets. However, we will always have to install our classes under
the directory WEB-INF/classes, and the WEB-INF hierarchy will be
hidden from public view.</p><p><a href="4576l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. HelloWorld.java, a simple
applet that handles the GET request method.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x257e738"></a>A Simple Servlet</h2></div></div><p>We can test our Tomcat installation by placing a simple
servlet, HelloWorld.java (see Listing 2), inside of the directory
mentioned above,
$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/examples/WEB-INF/classes/.</p><p>Remember that Java requires filenames to match the class
names. If you want to change the filename to ABC.java, you will
have to change the class declaration inside of the source code to
the same name. Otherwise, the Java compiler will complain with a
fatal error.</p><p>To compile HelloWorld.java into an executable servlet, use
the Java compiler, just as we would normally do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
javac HelloWorld.java
</pre><p>If your CLASSPATH environment variable was not set correctly,
javac will complain that it cannot resolve the symbols
HttpServletResponse, ServletException and a number of other
classes. Rectify this by setting your CLASSPATH to include
servlet.jar, as indicated above.
</p><p>Once the servlet has been complied, you should be able to
invoke it with
http://localhost:8080/examples/servlet/RequestInfoExample.</p><p>If you attach a firstname parameter to the URL, the servlet
should print your first name as well:
http://localhost:8080/examples/servlet/RequestInfoExample?firstname=Reuven.</p><p>As you can see, this servlet is extremely simple. It imports
a number of other useful Java packages, including the all-important
javax.servlet.* and javax.servlet.http.* hierarchies. We then
define our servlet as a subclass of HttpServlet. In doing so, we
inherit all of the logic of HttpServlet.</p><p>Our HelloWorld servlet is particularly simple and includes a
single method, <span   class="bold"><b>doGet</b></span>. doGet is
invoked whenever the servlet is invoked with the GET method. HTTP
supports a number of methods, but the most common are GET and POST;
GET is typically used when a user directly requests a URL or clicks
on a hyperlink, while POST is used when someone clicks on a
&ldquo;submit&rdquo; button at the bottom of an HTML form. Because our
servlet defines a doGet method but no doPost method, it can only
handle GET requests.</p><p>The two arguments to doGet describe the HTTP request and
response. If we want to retrieve information from the HTTP request,
we use a method on our request object. For example, we can retrieve
the value associated with the firstname parameter with the
getParameter method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
String firstname = request.getParameter("firstname");
</pre><p>If no firstname parameter was passed in the request, the
variable, &ldquo;firstname&rdquo;, will be assigned the null value. (This is
distinct from the empty string, which indicates that the parameter
was passed in the HTTP request but contained no value.)
</p><p>We can similarly affect the HTTP response by invoking methods
on our response object. For example, we can set the MIME type of
the HTTP response with the setContentType method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
response.setContentType("text/html");
</pre><p>To send information to the user's browser, we use
response.getWriter( ), which returns a PrintWriter:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
</pre>


Assuming that we are sending content of type text/html, we can now
use out.println to send HTML to the user's browser:
<pre     class="programlisting">
out.println("&lt;HTML&gt;");
out.println("&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Hello, world&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;");
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x2977068"></a>Apache</h2></div></div><p>We could continue to use Tomcat as our main HTTP server.
However, it is neither as fast nor as configurable as Apache or
most other servers. For this reason, it's typical to use Apache for
most HTTP requests and to forward servlet- or JSP-related requests
to Tomcat.</p><p>In order for Apache to communicate with Tomcat, we must
compile a module into our Apache server. The traditional way was
with <span   class="bold"><b>mod_jserv</b></span>, based on a project
called JServ. A new module, known as
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_jk</b></span>, compiles into your Apache
server similarly to mod_jserv but uses a more efficient and
flexible protocol to communicate with Tomcat.</p><p>The easiest way to install mod_jk is to download the source
code for Tomcat from the Jakarta web site. Even if you have
downloaded the binary version of Tomcat for general use, you will
need to retrieve the source code in order to compile and install
mod_jk. After you unpack the source distribution, change to
src/native/apache1.3. If you are using an early version of Apache
2.0, you should go to src/native/apache2.0 for the mod_jk source
code.</p><p>The following instructions assume you have built your Apache
server with the ability to handle DSO, dynamically loaded modules
that were not originally compiled into the server. DSO is a
wonderfully flexible mechanism for adding new modules; not all
modules can always handle this flexibility, and you might find
yourself compiling some or all of your Apache server statically.
While mod_jk can certainly be compiled statically, the on-line
documentation encourages users to install it as a DSO, both because
it is easier to do so and because it means that you can update
mod_jk without having to recompile Apache.</p><p>Compiling a module as a DSO means it must link against the
Apache server using the names and addresses that were specified at
the server's time of compilation. In order for us to compile
modules with the same environment and information as the server,
Apache provides <span   class="bold"><b>apxs</b></span>, a Perl
program that ensures our modules are compiled correctly. apxs takes
the same arguments as <span   class="bold"><b>cc</b></span>, as well
as several of its own that allow us to install the module
automatically.</p><p>From inside the apache1.3 directory, we can compile mod_jk in
httpd.conf with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs -i -o mod_jk.so -I../jk \
   -I$JAVA_HOME/include \
   -I$JAVA_HOME/include/linux -c *.c ../jk/*.c
</pre><p>If you enter the above command in three lines, rather than
one, remember to include the backslashes (\) as the final character
on each of the first two lines. Also note that we did not include
the -a option, which activates the module in the Apache
configuration file, because (as we shall soon see) that is done
from within another, automatically generated, configuration file.
</p><p>Now that mod_jk is installed, we must get Tomcat and mod_jk
to speak to each other. Normally, Tomcat expects to receive
requests from Apache with the Ajpv12 protocol. However, mod_jk and
Tomcat both understand the Ajpv13 protocol, which is more advanced
in a number of ways. We will thus need to modify our Tomcat
configuration so that it supports Ajpv13, and then configure Apache
to use that protocol to communicate with Tomcat.</p><p>Tomcat has two configuration files, one for the HTTP server
(web.xml) and one for the Java servlet container (server.xml)
files. Even if you have never worked with XML, you should not have
to worry very much; not only is XML easy to learn, but the Tomcat
configuration files are heavily commented. Both configuration files
are in the $TOMCAT_HOME/conf directory.</p><p>In order to tell Tomcat to use Ajpv13, we must find the
section of server.xml that defines the Ajp12 connector. The section
normally looks like this when you install Tomcat:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;ConnectorclassName="org.apache.tomcat.service.

    &lt;Parameter name="handler"
     value="org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.

    &lt;Parameter name="port" value="8007"/&gt;
&lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, this defines the TCP/IP connector handler and
indicates that Tomcat should use the Ajp12ConnectionHandler object
in the org.apache.tomcat.service.connector package. We will add a
similar block immediately following the one shown above:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Connector className="org.apache.tomcat.service.

   &lt;Parameter name="handler"
    value="org.apache.tomcat.service.connector.

   &lt;Parameter name="port" value="8009"/&gt;
&lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre>


Aside from changing the name of the handler object, you can see
that we have modified the port number to be 8009.
</p><p>The mod_jk instructions make it clear that we should add the
new Ajp13 handler to server.xml, leaving the Ajp12 handler in
place. Otherwise, there may be problems when you try to shut down
Tomcat.</p><p>Shut down Tomcat with $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh, and start
it up again with $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh, just to make sure
that the configuration changes did not break anything. If all is
fine, you should see messages indicating that the
HttpConnectionHandler is running on port 8080, the
Ajp12ConnectionHandler is running on port 8007 and the
Ajp13ConnectionHandler is running on port 8009.</p><p>The easiest and fastest way to tell Apache how to connect to
Tomcat is to use <span   class="bold"><b>mod_jk.conf-auto</b></span>,
a file that Tomcat generates each time it is restarted. This file,
which is located in $TOMCAT_HOME/conf, contains all of the Apache
directives necessary to load and use Tomcat. You simply need to
include this set of definitions from within your Apache
configuration:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Include /usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1/conf/mod_jk.conf-auto
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>mod_jk.conf-auto</b></span> is not only
useful and automatic, it also provides a good sense of how to
configure mod_jk and how to create sophisticated interactions
between Apache and Tomcat. One thing to remember when working with
Apache and Tomcat is that Apache must always start up after Tomcat
is running so it can connect to the appropriate socket.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x29779b0"></a>A Simple Set of Servlets</h2></div></div><p>To demonstrate how easy it is to write servlets, we will
create a simple web application&mdash;a blog-creation tool. Blogs, or
&ldquo;web logs&rdquo;, are increasingly popular web diaries in which the
newest entries traditionally appear at the top. The first web log
was Dave Winer's Scripting News
(<a href="http://www.scripting.com" target="_self">http://www.scripting.com/</a>),
but there are many thousands of web logs that provide useful news
and commentary on a variety of topics.</p><p>We will use servlets to create a very simple web log. The
actual log entries will be stored in a PostgreSQL database, which
we can define as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE BlogEntries (
  entry_id       SERIAL    NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY,
  entry_date     DATETIME  NOT NULL  CHECK

  entry_headline TEXT      NOT NULL  CHECK

  entry_text     TEXT      NOT NULL  CHECK

  UNIQUE(entry_date, entry_headline)
);
</pre><p>Since we're going to be retrieving data by date and headline,
we create an index on each of two columns:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE INDEX headline_date_index ON BlogEntries

CREATE INDEX entry_headline_index ON BlogEntries (entry_headline);
</pre>


Now that we have created our database table and indices, we will
need to create two servlets: one servlet will receive input from an
HTML form and use that input to insert a new row into the
BlogEntries table. (Presumably, this servlet will only be available
to the owner of the site, who is the editor of the web log.) The
second servlet will retrieve all web log entries from the last
three days, displaying them in the traditional
last-in-first-printed order.
</p><p>The servlet for adding a new web log entry, AddBlogEntry [see
Listing 3 at
<a href="../listings/084/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue84/</a>],
expects to receive two parameters from an HTML form. The first
parameter (entry_headline) contains the headline, while the second
(entry_text) contains the text associated with it.</p><p>The servlet in Listing 3 defines an instance variable con
which contains the JDBC database connection. The servlet also
defines three methods:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>init, which is before the servlet is first
executed. In init, we make an initial connection to the database,
keeping the connection around for future use.</p></li><li><p>doGet, which prints an error message indicating
that only POST requests will be honored by this servlet.</p></li><li><p>doPost, which uses the database connection
established by init to INSERT a new row into the BlogEntries
table.</p></li></ul></div><p>Modifying a servlet is different from modifying a CGI program
in that the servlet container must reload the servlet from disk.
Apache and mod_perl do not reload Perl modules by default; so too
does Tomcat ignore modified servlets by default. You can change
this behavior by setting the &ldquo;reloadble&rdquo; attribute to &ldquo;true&rdquo;;
if you fail to do this, you will need to restart Tomcat each time
you modify and recompile a servlet. Of course, there is a
performance penalty when servlets are reloadable, which is why the
Tomcat documentation suggests keeping them nonreloadable in
production systems.
</p><p>Our doPost method is the real workhorse in this servlet,
taking input from the user's HTML form and inserting them into our
table in PostgreSQL.</p><p>First we make sure that we have received the entry_headline
and entry_text parameters from the user and the parameters aren't
empty. If one or more is empty, then we create a message that
indicates what was missing. Otherwise, we go ahead and create a
PreparedStatement for inserting a new row into the database.</p><p>Perl programmers will see many similarities between JDBC and
Perl's DBI. JDBC requires that we create a statement based on the
database connection:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PreparedStatement statement =
   con.prepareStatement(
      "INSERT INTO BlogEntries " +
      "  (entry_date, entry_headline, entry_text) " +
      "  VALUES " +
      "  (NOW(), ?, ?)"
      );
</pre><p>Since we are using a PreparedStatement rather than a simple
statement, we can use question marks (?) instead of variable
values. The drivers for some databases, such as Oracle, take
advantage of these placeholders and use them for greater speed. But
even users of low-end databases can benefit from using placeholders
because they ensure strings will be quoted correctly, even if they
contain quotation marks or apostrophes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
statement.setString(1, entry_headline);
statement.setString(2, entry_text);
</pre>


Notice how the first placeholder is numbered 1, rather than 0. Keep
in mind that these two values are strings; if they were integers or
floating-point numbers, we would have to use a different method on
statement.
</p><p>Next, we perform the actual insert:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int updateCount = statement.executeUpdate();
</pre><p>updateCount is assigned the number of rows that were affected
by the executeUpdate() method. In this particular case, we were
trying to insert a single row, so we compare updateCount with 1. If
we were to use executeUpdate() to perform an SQL &ldquo;UPDATE&rdquo;,
updateCount might contain a different number.
</p><p>Finally, we catch exceptions that might have occurred during
our use of SQL. We then print an error message, including the text
of the exception. While printing such explicit messages to the end
user might not be a good idea on a production web site, it is an
excellent idea during development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x29783a8"></a>Displaying the Web Log</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how a servlet can be used to enter
information into our web log, we will write another servlet to
display the latest contents. This servlet will be relatively
simple; it will take no parameters and will display the latest
contents of the web log (see Listing 4 at
<a href="../listings/084/" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue84/</a>).</p><p>Our ShowBlog servlet will only have two methods,
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> (which is identical to the
&ldquo;init&rdquo; method from AddBlogEntry) and
<span   class="bold"><b>doGet</b></span>. doGet will retrieve all of
the entries in a web log, from the newest to the oldest. It
displays each entry as a three-column row in an HTML table, showing
the date and time at which it was added, the headline and the text
associated with that headline.</p><p>Of course, a real web log will do things in a slightly more
intelligent way, limiting the number of remarks and arranging them
with a better sense of design. But that's easy enough to do once we
have retrieved the information from the database in the correct
order.</p><p>We create our query (inside of a &ldquo;synchronized&rdquo; block) and
wrap it into a Statement. Notice how we need not use a
PreparedStatement because we are not planning to instantiate any
variable values into the statement.</p><p>We retrieve the results from the query into a
ResultSet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery(query);
</pre><p>A ResultSet allows us to pull results out of the database one
row at a time. We can iterate through each row inside of a while
loop using the rs.next( ) method. Within each iteration, we can
retrieve a column as a String value using the rs.getString( )
method, passing the name of the column as a parameter.
</p><p>After compiling this servlet and placing it on my system, I
was able to add some new web log entries and display them within a
matter of minutes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2485580.0x2978820"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Servlets are the Java world's equivalent to the Perl world's
modules for mod_perl. In many ways, they are actually better as
they provide a great deal of power without endangering the web
server with potentially risky programs. This month, we saw some
simple ways to build web applications using servlets and
open-source tools that we can download from the Web. Next month, we
will continue our exploration of server-side Java by looking at
some simple uses for Java Server Pages, also known as JSPs.</p><p><a href="4576s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
