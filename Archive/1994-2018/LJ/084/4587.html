(<i  >LJ</i> February 2001), thank you, thank you and
thank you. I couldn't see the forest because all them damn trees
were in the way. Your article really helped shed light on what the
names are, who the players are and what the scope of the paradigm
is.</p><p>Living in Northwestern Pennsylvania, we are kind of out of
the Silicon Valley mail loop. I've been on Victor Yodaiken's RTL
mailing list for two years and still didn't understand the
landscape. Your article really helped.</p><p>Thanks for helping us stay current.</p><p>&mdash;Raymond C.

<i  >LJ</i> February 2001. &ldquo;ide-floppy&rdquo; is not the
appropriate module for ATAPI class ZIP drives. ide-floppy works for
the original non-ATAPI IDE ZIP drives. The appropriate module is
&ldquo;ide-scsi&rdquo;. This information may be found in the ZIP drive
HOWTO.</p><p>This is a very serious difference. From firsthand experience,
I know that using ide-floppy on an ATAPI class ZIP drive will seem
to work but will invariably cause filesystem damage on the ZIP disk
(unless one does read-only operations with it).</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>&mdash;Michael O'Brien</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d0580.0x24c85b0"></a>Less-than-Secure?</h2></div></div><p>One of the examples in Mick Bauer's &ldquo;101 Uses of SSH, Part
II&rdquo; article (<i  >LJ</i> February 2001) gives a
misleading impression of security. Listing 6 shows how FTP can be
tunneled over ssh port-forwarding. If this were any other protocol
(say POP3 or IMAP), things would be fine.</p><p>But FTP actually uses <span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> connections,
not just one. The primary connection (port 21) is used as a control
channel, issuing commands to the server. The secondary channel is
set up each time there is data to be transferred on a different and
random port, if using passive mode. If you're not using passive
mode, the situation gets worse. The server tries to make a
connection back to you from port 20. Chances are this will be
blocked stone dead by any firewall nearby.</p><p>Anyway, the <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> command will
only forward the control channel and not the data channel. That is
enough to protect your password but not the data that passes
between the servers. This is a misleading state of affairs because
the connection may well work, even though most of it goes
unencrypted!</p><p>As far as I know, you cannot use FTP over SSH without
implementing special &ldquo;FTP watcher&rdquo; routines inside ssh. This is
not impossible; practically every NAT device on the market does the
equivalent. An alternative might be to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>sftp</b></span> command from ssh2. However,
I'm not sure whether this is included in OpenSSH yet.</p><p>&mdash;Dominic Mitchell</p><p>You're absolutely correct. While I do think there's some
value in encrypting the control channel even if the data channel is
not, that was a poor example, especially since I didn't point out
that the data channel does in fact go in clear text. But it does
work, even without an FTP-watcher: I've been using FTP over SSH in
the manner described in my article for a couple of years now. SCP
is still the most secure way to transfer files with OpenSSH. SFTP
is cool, but only partially supported in OpenSSH (client- or
d&aelig;mon-only, I can't remember which). But you can use SSH
Communications' &ldquo;official&rdquo; SSH v.2 for free if you run it on
Linux, xBSD, etc., thanks to a new &ldquo;Free Use for Open Source
OSes&rdquo; clause in its license.</p><p>&mdash;Mick Bauermick@visi.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d0580.0x24c8a28"></a>Give Us More</h2></div></div><p>Out of all the articles I've read in <i  >LJ</i>
over the years, few have had as much impact on me as the one on
<span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> (&ldquo;That's Vimprovemnt! A
BetterVi&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i> February 2001). I often spend
more time in vim than I do sleeping, and thanks to the article, I
now have a few more tricks to use. Some of the most glaring
features I was not aware of were the third mode (called visual),
the command mode <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span>. I learned vanilla
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> on Solaris, and there are a lot
of features in vim I have obviously not picked up yet. That being
the case, have you thought about a monthly feature on editors?
Since I imagine a great deal of your readers spend a lot of time in
editors such as <span   class="bold"><b>emacs</b></span>, vim,
<span   class="bold"><b>pico</b></span> and the like, perhaps a
regular feature is in order.</p><p>&mdash;Robert Lazarski</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d0580.0x24c8e48"></a>Sober Prediction</h2></div></div><p>Regarding your 2000 Editors' Choice Award for open-source
databases (see <i  >LJ</i> December 2000), I disagreed
with your pick for the year's best OS database. As per your
suggestion, I had a stiff Tom Collins, followed by some White
Russians <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> a few shooters. I became
light-headed, then dizzy and finally passed out before reconciling
myself to your pick. Having sobered up, I now take to my keyboard
for a more formal protest; I suggest your readers contact NuSphere
and evaluate their version of the MySQL database. While I realize
we'll just have to live with your pick for 2000, I predict that the
Editors' Choice for OS databases in 2001 will be NuSphere
MySQL&mdash;hands down and bottoms up.</p><p>&mdash;Bill McGowan</p><p>We met with NuSphere at LinuxWorld this past February, keep
an eye out for a formal product review in an upcoming issue.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d0580.0x24c9108"></a>Oops?</h2></div></div><p>Okay, was this on purpose or not? (If it was on purpose, then
it was extremely funny; otherwise it was also extremely funny but
in a completely different way.) I think the quote, &ldquo;Beware of bugs
in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it,&rdquo;
should be attributed to the great Donald Knuth, not Donald Knut

page 93) in which you mentioned that <i  >LJ</i> is
two-thirds the size of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Martha Stewart Living</em></span>
with one-tenth the staff. You also mentioned that Martha doesn't
have to lay out Perl code.</p><p>I wanted to let you know that we definitely do lay out Perl
code here at Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Don't forget, we have
an e-commerce site
(<a href="http://www.marthastewart.com" target="_self">http://www.marthastewart.com/</a>)
that does several million dollars' worth of business each year.
Also, our magazine staff puts out three regular magazines
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Living</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Babies</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Weddings</em></span>), as well as many special
editions.</p><p>Presently, our web site is running on NT servers, but we are
in the midst of migrating our site to Sun Solaris. And, you might
be interested to know that the server that streams media to the
site is running Red Hat Linux 7.0! Many of us here at Martha
Stewart are open-source fans with a particular interest in Linux. I
personally have been reading <i  >Linux Journal</i>
since issue number one. As a developer, I am constantly looking for
ways in which we can use Linux at work. Check the header of this
message, and you will see it is coming to you on a Linux machine
with Pine.</p><p>I wasn't offended by your article in the least, I just wanted
to let you know that even companies like Martha Stewart Living are
embracing Linux.</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>&mdash;Rick NoelleInternet Applications DeveloperMartha Stewart

Internet Computer&rdquo;. There is a screen shot of the NIC with some
apps running on it. Strange as it may sound, I'm very interested in
the calendar program running on that screen.</p><p>I've been using <span   class="bold"><b>xcalendar</b></span>
for years now, and I love its simplicity. However, it seems that
it's not being maintained. The calendar running on that screen shot
looks similar but different. I'd like to find out if it is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> minimalist calendar program.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>&mdash;Michael George</p><p>The X &ldquo;calendar&rdquo; client you see on the desktop in the
screen shot, you're absolutely correct, it is &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo;! Here
it is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cal | xmessage -file - -title "Calendar"
</pre><p>a better version is with the
<span   class="bold"><b>gcal</b></span> command (which
highlights the current day):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcal | xmessage -file - -title "Calendar"
</pre><p>If you use the
<span   class="bold"><b>tcal</b></span> command,
tomorrow's day will be highlighted. Of course, if you have a big
display (1600 &lt;\#215&gt; 1200), you can put up a year's calendar
with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cal -y | xmessage -file - -title "Happy New Year"
</pre><p>I know that this is a brain-dead calendar&mdash;if you want
something with a bit more intelligence that can launch calendars,
reminders and check your mail, look at the
<span   class="bold"><b>rclock</b></span> client...its man
page gives all sorts of interesting applications (such as changing
your desktop's hues according to the time of day&mdash;brightest at
noon, fading to darkness toward evening, etc.).
