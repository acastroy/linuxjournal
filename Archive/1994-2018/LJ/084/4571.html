    Running an efficient FTP server requires simplicity, security
    and high performance&mdash;take a look at this daemon.

attention, but what attention they do get is in the form of
security advisory after security advisory. There's not much hack
value for most people in supporting something as old-school as FTP,
so the state of the art has languished&mdash;until now. This article
will introduce you to Shane Kerr's
<span   class="bold"><b>oftpd</b></span>, an incredibly simple FTP
d&aelig;mon that, we think, will start to replace the old,
full-featured d&aelig;mons currently shipping on (and creating
security issues for) Linux distributions everywhere.
</p><p>Rick Moen, a Linux security guru who is also famous for his
ability to install Linux on many obsolete or unusual systems, runs
an FTP server mostly as an archive of Linux distributions to
install over the network. Boot from floppy, select &ldquo;Install from
FTP&rdquo; and Bob's your uncle. No need to figure out how to
<span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span> the driver for somebody's
ten-year-old 1x CD-ROM drive. (Please, don't everyone go knocking
on Rick's door with your VIC-20s and PDP-8s; he gets plenty of
challenges from regular installfests and user-group
meetings.)</p><p>FTP remains useful for three reasons, Rick says. First, FTP
provides automatic, informative directory listings, including file
modification times, to facilitate mirroring. Second, there's no
&ldquo;index.html&rdquo; to override a d&aelig;mon-generated directory
listing in FTP, so it's easy to mirror entire directory trees or
grab them with <span   class="bold"><b>snarf</b></span>.</p><p>Finally, Rick finds that you can get small FTP clients for
legacy OSes or special situations where an HTTP client won't fit.
For example, Rick used a MacOS FTP client to copy Debian floppies
to an old Macintosh with no CD-ROM and insufficient memory for a
web browser. People who install a lot of Red Hat or Red Hat-based
systems using Kickstart floppies soon find that FTP installs are
fast, convenient and let you keep a single software archive
up-to-date on the FTP server. You can do the same thing with an NFS
(Network File System) install, but FTP is faster.</p><p>The qualities people need from an FTP d&aelig;mon have
changed since the old d&aelig;mons were written. First, the days of
logging in to an FTP site with a username and password (which get
sent in plaintext over the Net) are gone, gone, gone. People are
using <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>scp</b></span> and other encrypted tools to
protect their passwords on the Net when they transfer nonpublic
files, so the FTP d&aelig;mon no longer needs to authenticate
users. Second, performance matters. People aren't just using FTP to
get an occasional piece of software or pass along work to
colleagues. FTP servers should be prepared to get slammed by many
clients all installing an entire Linux distribution at once.</p><p>So, the two goals for running a modern FTP server are: for
security, simplify both your Policy and FTP d&aelig;mon to
&ldquo;anonymous FTP only&rdquo;, and look for a d&aelig;mon that offers good
performance. That's what brings us to oftpd.</p><p>For security, oftpd runs as a non-root user except for
essential setup tasks. It runs &ldquo;chrooted&rdquo; to the public FTP
directory. These features buy you a lot, security-wise, and an
old-fashioned FTP d&aelig;mon that allows users to log in with a
username and password that can't match it. For simplicity and
performance, oftpd itself generates directory listings instead of
running <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176d580.0x1865a28"></a>Moving from Old-School FTP to oftpd</h2></div></div><p>The first step in setting up oftpd is to get rid of the old
ftp entry in inetd.conf. The FTP d&aelig;mon that probably came
with your Linux distribution gets run by inetd, while oftpd runs
standalone for speed. Just comment out the ftp line with a # at the
beginning, so it looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ftp stream  tcp nowait  root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.ftpd -l -a
</pre><p>Now <b  >killall -HUP inetd</b> to restart inetd,
so that it knows not to respond to connections on the FTP port. If
you <b  >ftp localhost</b> you should get a
<b  >Connection refused</b>.
</p><p>Now, we're ready to move on to oftpd itself. First, the easy
part. To compile and install, just unpack the tar file,
<b  >cd</b> into the resulting directory and use the One
True GNU Way (<b  >./configure</b>;
<b  >make</b>; <b  >make install</b>). To keep
everything in its appropriate, canonical place, supply the bindir
argument to the configure script, so that
<span   class="bold"><b>make install</b></span> will put the oftpd
executable in /usr/local/sbin, which is the appropriate directory
for locally built d&aelig;mons:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sh ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/sbin &amp;&amp; make
</pre><p>Then <b  >su</b> root and do:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre>


The installation is so generic that the INSTALL document in the
version of oftpd I used begins simply, &ldquo;These are generic
installation instructions&rdquo;. That's a good thing. By the time you
read this, there will probably be RPM or deb packages for your
favorite distribution, so check there first for an even easier
install.
</p><p>The above compile and install step, as well as the following
three steps, will be handled for you if you install oftpd from an
RPM or deb package, but you'll have to complete them if you're
installing oftpd from source.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176d580.0x18660b0"></a>Add the oftpd User</h2></div></div><p>One of the most important rules of Linux security is &ldquo;Don't
run anything as root that you don't have to&rdquo;. oftpd, like Apache
and other d&aelig;mons, follows this rule by dropping root
privilege right after it starts listening on its standard,
root-only port. If you're looking at the oftpd source, this is
found in src/oftpd.c, where &ldquo;create our main listener&rdquo; is
followed immediately by &ldquo;set user to be as inoffensive as
possible&rdquo;. So, you'll be starting oftpd as root, but you'll need
to add a user that it can run as afterward. Run
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>useradd</b></span> (whichever one your
distribution provides) to create a new user called
&ldquo;oftpd&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176d580.0x1866268"></a>Test oftpd by Starting and Stopping It
Manually</h2></div></div><p>As root, start oftpd like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/sbin/oftpd oftpd /home/httpd/html
</pre><p>The two arguments are: first, the user to run as and, second,
the FTP directory to use. You can point both Apache and oftpd at
the same directory so that all of your content is available either
by HTTP or FTP. Substitute your own web server's &ldquo;DocumentRoot&rdquo;
directory as the second argument. You can always make a separate
FTP directory if you want, but this way lets people use HTTP to get
files from your server if they're behind a misconfigured firewall
that doesn't let FTP connections through.
</p><p>If oftpd starts without errors, try visiting localhost with
your favorite FTP client or <b  >ftp://localhost/</b>
with your web browser. You should be able to get a directory
listing of your chosen FTP directory. If you do, you're almost
done. Have a refreshing beverage. Two bad things can happen with
the above command, but they're easy to deal with. If you get an
&ldquo;invalid user name&rdquo; error, you didn't create the oftpd user
correctly. If you specify a nonexistent directory, you won't
immediately see an error message, but you won't get a directory
listing, and oftpd will log an error using syslog. On my Debian
box, syslog puts oftpd's log messages in daemon.log. You can change
that by editing /etc/syslogd.conf, but that's another
article.</p><p>As root, kill oftpd for now with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
killall oftpd
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176d580.0x1866580"></a>Make an oftpd init Script</h2></div></div><p>Next, you'll need to make an init script to start and stop
oftpd. As root, cd into your init.d directory (/etc/rc.d/init.d on
Red Hat, /etc/init.d on Debian) and pick out an init script to copy
and edit (I like to copy new init scripts from the one for
<span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span>, because it's very simple).
Two small features to watch for: oftpd (version 0.2.0) does not
currently write a pidfile in /var/run, and the PID of the running
process is not the same as the PID of the process you started
because oftpd forks when it starts up. So in the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; section
of your init script, you'll need to take the appropriate steps to
kill oftpd by name instead of by PID. On Debian, use the --exec
option of <span   class="bold"><b>start-stop-d&aelig;mon</b></span>
(see Listing 1). However, the
<span   class="bold"><b>killproc</b></span> function on Red Hat will
automatically kill by name if it can't find a pidfile.</p><p><a href="4571l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. oftpd init Script for
Debian</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176d580.0x1866840"></a>Welcome Back, Installers of Packages</h2></div></div><p>If you installed a package instead of source, everything up
to this point will have been done for you. Check that the init
script points oftpd to the appropriate directory, but that's about
it. Now, whether you installed from source or from a package, just
<b  >cd</b> into your init.d directory and do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./oftpd start
</pre><p>Then check ftp://localhost/ to make sure oftpd is up; use
your distribution's runlevel management tool to set oftpd to start
automatically when you enter your default runlevel; and
<b  >ftp</b> to your server from the outside to make sure
some firewall weenie hasn't filtered FTP out of your network. Now
you have a working, simple FTP server suitable for software
archives of all kinds. You can mirror your favorite Linux
distribution and invite everyone you know to bring their boxes over
for a quick network install.
