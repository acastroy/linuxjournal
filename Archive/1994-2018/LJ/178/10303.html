A review of the Dell Mini 9.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1551580.0x16492a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I think of the range of different laptops in the world as falling into
three basic models: mini, standard and huge. The huge laptops are those
with 17" (or larger) screens. The standard laptops are those with
14"&ndash;15" screens. Mini laptops are a new breed. Popularly known as
Netbooks, they come with small 9"&ndash;10" screens, small keyboards,
802.11b/g/n wireless adapters and usually no optical drive. For me, the
huge laptops are much too large to bother with. I consider standard-size
laptops the perfect trade-off between portability and functionality&mdash;they're big enough to have full-size keyboards, and the screens are decent
in size, but they still are small enough to be fairly portable. There
are, of course, many laptops that fall between or outside these three
categories, but they provide a good starting point for me.
</p><p>
Standard and huge laptops have been around for a while, and most of the
recent excitement in the laptop world has centered around the mini or
Netbook segment. I was curious whether one of these ultraportable Netbooks
would make a compelling replacement for the old Dell Latitude D610 I've
been carrying around for several years, so I picked up the recently
released Mini 9. The Mini is Dell's entrant into the Netbook market.

The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
True to form, there are several options from which to choose when purchasing a
Mini 9 from Dell. These include all the standards like a larger hard
drive, more memory, integrated Bluetooth and a built-in Webcam. You
even can choose to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; the Ubuntu 8.04.1 OS that the base model
comes with to Windows XP. Why anyone would want to do that is beyond me,
but the option is there if you want it.
</p><p>
I chose to keep things simple and get the base model. I did this for a
few reasons, the first of which was the nice $349 ($373 after taxes)
price tag. The second reason is so many reviews cover fully loaded
machines with every option possible, which I think leads to a false sense
of capability. For this review, I wanted to explore exactly how good the
base model is.
</p><p>
The base Mini 9 (at the time of this writing) comes with an Intel Atom processor
N270 running at 1.6GHz and a 533MHz 512K L2 Cache. It also comes with
512MB of RAM, a 4GB SSD (solid-state drive), 8.9" screen, 802.11g wireless
networking and a 32-Watt-hour four-cell battery. Unfortunately, 
no Webcam is included in the base model.
</p><p>
The build quality of the Mini is very good. The screen hinge is precise
and reliable, and the case has little to no flex. It just feels solid. The
ports are pretty standard: three USB ports (two on the left side, one on the
right), an SD/MMC/memory stick card reader, a VGA port, headphone and
microphone jacks, and an Ethernet port. With everything else on the Mini,
including the keyboard, display and trackpad, being shrunk, it is nice
that the ports are the standard full-size variants instead of proprietary
miniature versions that require special cables you can't find anywhere.
</p><p>
It comes as no surprise that the D610 has the Mini beat in the ports
department. It has all the ports the Mini has (except the card
reader) as well as an additional USB port, a DVD drive, S-Video out,
Modem, parallel port and serial port. It makes up for the lack of a
built-in card reader with a PCMCIA slot, which coincidently enough, I
have filled with a four-in-one card reader.
</p><p>
The resolution of the Dell Mini 9's 8.9" screen is 1024x600. The
width of the screen is good for most Web sites. The 600-pixel height
normally would not be enough in my mind, but the Mini gets around this
by turning the Windows key into a dedicated &ldquo;full-screen&rdquo; button that
works in most applications. I'm glad Dell did something with that key, as
otherwise it would be a wasted space on a keyboard that's cramped
enough already. I've actually caught myself pressing the windows key on
my other systems when I wanted to take an application full screen. The
D610 has a 14" screen, but the resolution is practically the same:
1024x768. The extra height of the D610 screen is nice, but it's not enough
to give it a clear advantage over the Mini.
</p><p>
One additional note about the screen on the Mini is that it's very bright,
easily beating the D610. The screen also is viewable in almost all
lighting conditions. The D610 screen is easily overpowered in sunlight,
so the Mini has a definite advantage there.
</p><p>
The speakers on the Mini are nothing special. They sit on either side of
the Dell logo beneath the screen, and they get the job done. They're not
as loud as the speakers on the D610, but the sound quality is similarly
average. For everyday listening on either laptop, a good pair of headphones
is the best choice.
</p><p>
The trackpad on the Mini is molded in as part of the case plastic instead
of being a separate piece like on the D610. Dell wisely chose to keep
the left and right mouse buttons below the trackpad instead of moving
them off to the side like other Netbook manufacturers. The sensitivity
and accuracy beats the trackpad on the D610 easily, but the finger nub
on the D610 is better than either trackpad. My preference is to use a
mouse whenever possible, but I can live with the Mini's trackpad when
a mouse is not available.
</p><p>
The four-cell battery the Mini comes with has been good for
3.5&ndash;4.5 hours of battery life, depending on the load to which
I have subjected it. I can't remember what the battery life was on
the D610 when it was new, but the Mini beats it by at least an hour now.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1551580.0x1649da8"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
Dell calls the OS installed on the Mini the &ldquo;Mini OS powered by Ubuntu
8.04&rdquo;. The main difference between it and regular Ubuntu 8.04 is the
desktop replacement software, which gives you handy shortcuts to your
most-used applications instead of the normal Ubuntu desktop. It also
dispenses with the bottom GNOME panel and opts instead to put everything
up at the top to save space.
</p><p>
One of the primary things that attracted me to the Mini is its inclusion
of Ubuntu pre-installed. My D610 runs Ubuntu fine, and almost everything
&ldquo;just works&rdquo; on it. By &ldquo;almost&rdquo; I mean everything except the wireless
driver, which tends to break every time I upgrade to a new version of
Ubuntu or apply an especially big update. I can fix the wireless easily,
but it's a pain to have to do so as often as I do. Because the Mini comes
with Ubuntu pre-installed, my hope was that everything would &ldquo;just
work&rdquo;
out of the box with no effort on my part, and Dell did not disappoint.
</p><p>
Boot times are in the minute range, which is not super speedy, but also
not slow enough to be annoying.
</p><p>
When booting the Mini the first time, Dell displays a few notices
about where and how to request service, should it be required, and then
leads you through the process of creating an initial user and making
various setting choices, including language and login preferences.
</p><p>
One thing the setup does not do is prompt you for your networking
settings. Instead, you are expected to configure this after you log in
the first time. That wasn't a big deal to me, but I think it could
lead to a &ldquo;what do I do now?&rdquo; moment for novice users.
</p><p>
As mentioned before, after logging in to the Mini 9 you are, by
default, shown a custom launcher interface instead of a regular Ubuntu
desktop. The launcher comes configured with a generic set of categories:
Productivity, Web, Entertainment, Games and Learn. Under each one is a
set of applications. The oddest choice in my mind is that the Nautilus
file manager is stuck in the Entertainment category. The categorization
of other applications makes more sense: OpenOffice.org Writer is 
under Productivity, Rhythmbox is under Entertainment, Firefox and
Pidgin are in the Web group and so on. All in all, the selection of apps
is nice and surprisingly broad, and new users will find plenty to keep
them occupied for a good long while.

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10303f4.large.jpg"><img src="10303f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Productivity category has links to the various OpenOffice.org
products and to Acrobat Reader.
</p></div></div><p>
The categories and apps in the groups can be modified easily. When you
hover your mouse over a group or application tile, a little teardrop icon
appears in the upper-right corner. Clicking on that spins the
tile around and presents you with a small configuration dialog. You can
change the icon that appears on the tile, the name of the tile and, in
the case of launcher tiles, you can configure the application, folder
or Web site the tile opens.
</p><p>
Apart from the launcher, the rest of the system is regular Ubuntu. The
APT package management works wonderfully, and the Mini comes configured
to use a special Mini-9-only repository hosted by Canonical. It contains
everything I've tried to install, but it doesn't track in lockstep
with the main Ubuntu repositories&mdash;for example, at the time of this writing,
Ubuntu 8.10 is not available through it, but it does provide timely
security updates.
</p><p>
With only four gigabytes to work with, disk space is an issue, but not
as much as I thought it would be. As it comes from the factory, the Mini
uses about 3GB of disk space for the OS and applications,
leaving a single gigabyte free on the base model. Instead of loading this
remaining space with media files, I put them on an SD card, and that
arrangement has worked very well. With a couple 8GB or 16GB SDHC cards,
I don't think I will ever lack for &ldquo;space&rdquo; on the Mini.
</p><p>
The Mini comes preconfigured with several useful add-ons, including
Java, Adobe Flash and Adobe Acrobat. There also are several add-ons that
are not so useful (to me anyway), such as the Yahoo Toolbar and the Dell
Video Chat program. Of course, if I were a Yahoo user or had purchased
the integrated Webcam, those add-ons probably would be on my useful list,
so I can't knock them too much.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1551580.0x164a7a0"></a>
Dislikes</h2></div></div><p>
Not everything is rosy in Mini-land. There are a few things that I just
do not like or cannot seem to adapt to.
</p><p>
The biggest complaint I have with the Mini is that the keyboard is
cramped. In fairness, I expected the keyboard to be cramped, and in some
ways, the keyboard is better than I expected. The alphanumeric
keys are nearly full size, with the punctuation and modifier
keys on the left and right sides half as wide. The keyboard has a good
feel, and I would be perfectly happy with it if not for a few
<span   class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span> problems
I have with the keyboard layout. The first issue I have with the layout
is the single (') and double (") quotes key has been moved from the
home row to the bottom of the keyboard next to the arrow keys. This is
a stupid place for a key that I use all the time. There's a reason this
key is on the home row. My little finger ends up hitting the Return key
all the time whenever I want to quote anything.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10303f5.large.jpg"><img src="10303f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Mini's keyboard is full of compromises&mdash;some good, some bad.
</p></div></div><p>
Another issue I have with the keyboard layout is some keys have been
pushed off the regular keyboard entirely and can be accessed
only while pressing the Fn key. These include the function keys (F1&ndash;F10),
the braces keys ({, }, [ and ]), pipe (|), backslash
(\), accent (`) and tilde (~) keys. I'm sure most people won't miss many
of those keys, but for me, the difficulty in getting
to them is an annoyance that prevents me from doing much of any shell
scripting or even long-winded blog posts on it.
</p><p>
The last issue I have with the keyboard, and which my fingers are as
yet unable to get used to, is the dash (-) and equals (=) keys have
been pushed down one row to make room for the Delete and Backspace
keys. Instead of being to the right of the number keys, they are to
the right of the P key (where the braces keys should be). In typing
terms, this means I keep pressing Delete every time I try to enter a dash
or underscore.
</p><p>
I can't be too hard on the keyboard though, because the fact is, there's
just not enough space to put every key where my fingers think it should
go. What we get is a compromise, and like all compromises, there are
things I like and things I don't.
</p><p>
Another issue I have with the Mini is time-related. When resuming
from sleep, the Network Manager takes an additional 10&ndash;20 seconds
or so after the computer wakes up before it gets the network up and
running. This extra waiting is annoying, but there's probably not much
that can be done about it.
</p><p>
I have also experienced an occasional Network Manager glitch where
it refuses to stay connected to my wireless router and refuses to
auto-connect when I log in. Usually a reboot fixes it. It may be that
Network Manager and I just don't get along.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Mini 9 from Dell is a great little laptop. It is very capable and
can do just about everything I want a laptop to do. For those who can
adapt to working with a smaller keyboard, it is at least as capable
as any three- or four-year-old laptop, like my D610, without the driver
headaches. And, if portability is a big concern, it is hard to beat the
dimensions and weight of the Mini. It is the only laptop I've used that
fits into my motorcycle tank bag, which is a big plus in my book.
</p><p>
However, I have decided not to keep it. I'm not sending it back or
anything; instead, I'm going to give it to my eldest daughter for her
birthday. She's old enough for her own computer, and her hands fit the
keyboard better than mine. I've also let her &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; it a few times over
the past few weeks, and she thinks it's &ldquo;really cool&rdquo; (her
words). But, don't tell her that she's getting it, I want it to be a surprise.
