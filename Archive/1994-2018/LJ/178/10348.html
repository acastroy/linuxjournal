Wolfram Research's Mathematica</h2></div></div><p>
After rocketing its Mathematica application from version 6 to 7
in just 18 months, Wolfram Research's developers may need testing
for blood-caffeine content. Mathematica is a powerful general
computation environment for calculations, large-scale computations,
complex programming, and visualizing and modeling data. After dubbing
Mathematica 6 the &ldquo;most important advance in its 20-year
history&rdquo;,
Wolfram says that version 7 is a major release that adds 500 new
functions and 12 new application areas. Added functionality includes
image processing, built-in parallel HPC, new on-demand curated data and
other new computational innovations. The firm further claims that this
release has made parallel computing mainstream. Mathematica 7 has 32-
and 64-bit editions for Linux x86, Solaris UltraSPARC/x86, Windows and
Mac OS X.

Neuros Technology's Neuros LINK and Neuros.TV Service</h2></div></div><p>
The Neuros folks definitely think like we do. Their new Neuros LINK is a
hackable, nonproprietary set-top box that connects the television to the
Internet via existing open Internet standards. Neuros positions
the device &ldquo;squarely between the dedicated, proprietary electronics
devices and the powerful but clunky and expensive personal
computer&rdquo;.
One can play downloaded content in virtually any format from any source.
Neuros also claims to have created a navigation structure that makes
the LINK experience &ldquo;feel like TV browsing rather than Web
browsing&rdquo;.
Currently, the LINK is a Gamma Product&mdash;that is, the post-beta, white box
preproduction stage especially geared for hackers and hard-core early
adopters. Meanwhile, the accompanying Neuros.TV is a free service that
enables Neuros LINK users to find, organize and share Web-based video
content.

Fixstars' Yellow Dog Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Same dog, new tricks, different owner. In other words, the popular
Yellow Dog Linux (YDL) for the Cell Processor has been upgraded to
version 6.1 and is now under the tutelage of the company Fixstars.
The Tokyo-based Fixstars recently acquired Terra Soft Solutions, the
company long associated with YDL. Fixstars states that YDL 6.1 is unique
in that it drives both the desktop and development environments forward
simultaneously. For end users, YDL v6.1 offers an improved graphical
wireless configuration tool and the ability to use PS3 video RAM for
temporary storage or swap. For developers, it offers advancements such as
the new Cell Superscalar and support for the Cell's programming model.
Supported platforms include Apple G4/G5, Sony PS3, YDL PowerStation and
IBM Power Systems.

NICTA and Infocomm Research's Maritime Wireless Mesh Network</h2></div></div><p>
Though still in the prototype stage, a wireless mesh network for ships
has been announced by two research institutions: Australia's NICTA and
Singapore's Institute for Infocomm Research. Under normal conditions,
the maritime system provides data and voice communications between
port authorities, container terminals and ships via shore-based WiMax
inter-ship connectivity. In poor weather conditions, the system utilizes
a backup satellite system. Because, says NICTA, standard VoIP and other
data-transport techniques don't work well with satellite systems, the
system utilizes onboard mesh nodes and NICTA's mobile routers to handle
the satellite connectivity. The shore-based system aims to deliver a 6Mbps long-range (20km) ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore mesh communication
system capable of ad hoc multi-hop communication with other vessels and
shore command stations.

Ingres Corp.'s Ingres Database</h2></div></div><p>
If we open-source enthusiasts have anything to brag about, it is a
great selection of robust databases. A fine case in point is Ingres
Corporation's Ingres Database, which was just upgraded to version 9.2.
The company bills Ingres as &ldquo;flexible, simple, secure, reliable and
scalable [and able to] cope with even the most complex, multilanguage
requirements including business intelligence, content management,
data warehousing, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and logistics
management&rdquo;. Core advancements in version 9.2 relate to improved
application development, enhanced availability and supportability, as
well as the simplification and automation of many tasks traditionally
associated with maintaining a business-class database.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wiley Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Engineering</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
While the Web provides information in bulk at your fingertips, there
remains no substitute for concise, authoritative reference works that
are more than a stranger's brain dump. Such is the role of Benjamin
W. Wah's new <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wiley Encyclopedia of Science and
Engineering</em></span>, a five-volume,
3,300-page set with more than 450 A-to-Z articles on the latest advances and
findings in computer science and engineering. Some broad topics include
standards, electronic commerce, financial engineering and computer
education. Each article is written by experts in their particular
specialty and is peer-reviewed by two others to ensure reliability.

Warren D. Sande and Carter Sande's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello World!</em></span> (Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
The father-son team of Warren D. Sande and Carter Sande think that anyone
can program a computer, even a 12-year-old. The duo's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello
World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners</em></span> from Manning is a
&ldquo;gentle but thorough introduction to the world of computer
programming&rdquo;.
Written in a manner free of &ldquo;geek speak&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello
World!</em></span> contains lots
of pictures, cartoons and fun examples to hold the reader's interest.
The free Python is the programming language utilized in the book.
Programming concepts that are covered include memory, looping, decisions,
input and output, data structures, graphics and others, which are then
applied to interesting topics like computer graphics, game programming
and simulations. The publisher says that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hello World!</em></span> can be used in
either a home or classroom setting.
