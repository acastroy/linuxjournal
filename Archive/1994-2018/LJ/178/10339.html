In a world of Web 2.0 applications, AJAX
applications and content management systems with countless plugins,
you might think the humble Web site is a thing of the past. Not true. But,
when working with these sites, we turn to the same tools over and over
again. Time for something a little unusual, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non?</em></span>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1387580.0x147f4b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I thought you said this Web site was basically a single page,
Fran&ccedil;ois, and yet you've been at it for hours. Are you having trouble tuning in to
those creative waves? Oh, I see, you haven't even started the page. Still
trying to set up a PHP content management system, looking for plugins
and trying out themes? Seems like a lot of work for a one-page site. That
house your Aunt Guylaine is trying to sell will have sold itself before
you get her page up on our site. Now, now, Fran&ccedil;ois, I'm not trying to
be mean. I'm simply suggesting that you might be working a little too
hard, and it is getting late. Our guests are already starting to arrive,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Look sharp.
</p><p>
Good evening, everyone, and welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where fine wine
is paired with delectable open-source software. Please, sit and make
yourselves comfortable. Tonight's wine is a Sella &amp; Mosca Cannonau
Sardegna Riserva 2005, a rather intense Italian red that certainly
will capture your attention. Fran&ccedil;ois, please head to the wine cellar and
bring up a couple cases. 
</p><p>
When it comes to HTML and site creation tools, there's comfort in the
familiar. KDE users create with Quanta Plus, and GNOME users code with
Bluefish. Yet, plenty of other tools exist; some you may never
have heard of. Tonight, I'd like to introduce you to a few. Of course,
you don't always need to <span   class="emphasis"><em>create</em></span> a Web page. All you need is a Web
version of something you already have. For instance, simple
tools are available designed specifically to convert one or another document
format into HTML. Suppose you wanted to show off your rather sweet Perl
script in HTML format, with syntax highlighting. That might take some
pretty tedious HTML coding in an editor. There is an easier way.
</p><p>
The faithful re-creation of code can be tough, especially with all those
angle brackets, ampersands and other special characters that permeate
many languages. For that, we have code2html, a rather clever little
program that takes your code and turns it into great-looking HTML (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f1.large.jpg"><img src="10339f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Perl script is
converted to clean, easy-to-read HTML, courtesy of code2html. Extra
points if you can identify the script.
</p></div></div><p>
The basic form of the command is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
code2html your_code &gt; somefile.html
</pre>
</p><p>
It certainly is possible that code2html won't be able to figure
out what kind of code you are giving it. These are called modes in
the program's notes, and you can display all the modes by calling
<tt  >code2html -m</tt>. Let's assume that the program couldn't make
out a particular shell script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
code2html -o html-dark -l shellscript 
 &#8618;/etc/rc.d/rc.local &gt; ~/rc.html
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, I did add a couple additional flags. From the -m
output, I found that the mode for a shell script was shellscript, which I
passed using the -l flag. The -o flag tells the program
to produce a dark background HTML page as opposed to the default white.
</p><p>
There are similar programs to generate HTML code from a variety of
sources. Some operate locally to generate static pages, and others
can act as CGI scripts and produce dynamic text (like
<tt  >man2html</tt>,
for example).
</p><p>
What about the humble Microsoft Word, doomed forever to live
in a proprietary format? Sure, you could find people with a copy of
Microsoft Office and have them save the document as HTML, but why go
through all that trouble? One very useful program I've used in the
past is called wv. More accurately, Dom Lachowicz's
wv is more of a collection of tools, including a library for
creating filters within other programs. Some of these programs convert
Word documents (2000, 97, 95 and others) into PDF (wvPDF),
plain text (wvtext) and, yes, HTML (wvHtml), to name
just a few. The real plus of using something like wvHtml is that you
can batch-convert a whole collection of documents via a shell
script.
</p><p>
To convert your .doc format file to HTML, use the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wvHtml filename.doc newfile.html
</pre>
</p><p>
If there are embedded images, they will be extracted with links
added to the HTML file.
</p><p>
Eventually, however, you may need to do a little HTML coding
yourself. Although it's not difficult to learn, basic HTML does require you
to follow that particular language's syntax as you mark up your document
for presentation. Even if you do know HTML, most people don't want to
type out every tag and attribute manually. That's why we have HTML
editors&mdash;to make that tedious work somewhat less tedious. In keeping
with my theme of obscure, largely unknown Web creation tools, allow me
to introduce a few HTML editors you likely have never heard of.
</p><p>
The first is HTMLpage, a simple HTML editor written in
Python&mdash;and, I do mean simple. Regular visitors to this restaurant will
know that I occasionally cover things for reasons that include fun as
well as education. Given that this editor is basically a Python program,
with plain-text code easily viewed and edited, it's also a great little
program for learning and tweaking a little Python. Nevertheless, 
this oh-so-simple editor has some handy features, such as automatic table
generation and conversion of links as well as basic text to HTML. There's
a color widget for selecting and inserting color codes. The editor even
supports drag and drop of page elements, such as graphics, directly into
the editing window&mdash;all this in a few hundred lines of Python code.
</p><p>
To use HTMLpage, simply extract the package into a folder of
your choosing and execute the HTMLpage.py file from there. An editing
window appears with the opening and closing HTML tags automatically
inserted. From there, you can enter your text in between the body
tags. Some things are pretty cool for such a simple program. For instance,
enter your text, select it, and click the HTML-ify button. Paragraph and
line breaks are taken care of automatically. Select a link (Figure
2), click that same button and the proper tags are inserted.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f2.large.jpg"><img src="10339f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. HTMLpage,
though modest in design, has some interesting automatic features, like
HTML-ify and Table-ify.
</p></div></div><p>
Want to create a table? Simply enter your text separated by tabs. On
the second (and third and fourth) line, do the same until you have all
your data. Select it, and then click the Table-ify button. Your information 
is inserted into a table automatically. When you click the HTML-ify button,
just as when you click the Table-ify button, a little magic takes place
beneath the surface. The result looks like what is shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f3.large.jpg"><img src="10339f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. In no time flat, the page elements come together.
</p></div></div><p>
Of course, if you are going to create something of any complexity, you
will need something a little more interesting than HTMLpage. So,
let's look at the second HTML editor you've probably never heard of.
</p><p>
While my faithful waiter refills your glasses, perhaps what you
really need for that simple Web site or page is a spot of TEA.
</p><p>
Peter Semiletov's TEA is a light, but full-featured HTML
editor written in Qt (Figure 4). It's small, fast and contains
a surprising number of features, including some you won't find in the larger,
shinier Web site design tools. Aside from the obvious HTML tag edits,
TEA has a tabbed layout, template and scripting support (Python, Perl,
Ruby and so on), Bookmarks, syntax highlighting, drag and drop into the
editing window (such as for images), Wikipedia editing and a whole lot
more. There's even a Morse code translator&mdash;seriously.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f4.large.jpg"><img src="10339f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The TEA HTML
editor is available in both GTK and Qt. Active development, however,
is Qt-only.
</p></div></div><p>
To try out the latest-and-greatest TEA, you'll likely have to build
it from source (although some packages are available on the site), but
that's relatively easy. Extract the source into a folder of your choice,
and type <tt  >qmake</tt> from inside that folder, followed by
<tt  >make
install</tt>. The result is a single executable called tea. A
slightly older version of TEA exists called teagtk (Peter recently
shifted development from GTK to Qt). Although it's not as up to date, it should
be in many repositories, just waiting to be downloaded.
</p><p>
Along the right-hand side of TEA's editing window, you'll see
four tabs. These give you access to the editing window (which is itself
multitabbed, one for each open document), TEA's built-in file browser,
the setup page and, finally, a manual labeled learn. Below the main
window, there's a scrolling status window that displays your most recent
action. The file browser makes it easy to insert bookmarks anywhere
inside your directory tree for quick access. TEA also has a special
quick-access file called Crapbook (accessible under the File menu)
into which you can scribble quick notes regarding your current project.
</p><p>
The best place to start, after clicking the New button, is in
the function menu. While you can create and store templates to get you
started on a project or page, clicking Function, then Place from the
menu bar lets you insert a basic HTML template to start your document
(Figure 5). Notice as well that all the menus are tear-off&mdash;there's
a dashed line above each one. Simply click the dashed line and drag the
menu to your desktop. You might want to do this with the Markup menu
for basic HTML tagging.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f5.large.jpg"><img src="10339f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. TEA's menus
are all tear-off. Simply click on the dashed line at the top of a menu
and drag it to your desktop. And, yes, that says Morse code.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's move on to another editor you've probably never heard of. Screem,
written by David Knight, is a great site creation tool written for the
GNOME desktop environment (Figure 6). You can, of course, run it under
KDE, as I am doing at this moment. If the name seems a bit frightening,
cast your worries aside. Screem is an acronym for Site CReation and
Editing Environment, and in that respect, it is aptly named. Some of
Screem's features include a number of wizards to insert special characters
(entities), generate a form, create a table or provide you with an easy
way to select color.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f6.large.jpg"><img src="10339f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Screem
HTML editor and site creator is nothing to be afraid of.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1387580.0x1480c70"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Like the others I've covered so far, Screem is
also a code editor, as opposed to a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
editor. Strangely, there are advantages to a code editor that may not
be immediately apparent if you like the idea of building a Web page
the way you would create a word-processing document. The big advantage
is control, although there certainly are others. A code editor lets you
see exactly what your HTML tags look like, making it possible for you to
produce exactly the code that you want. The HTML produced in code editors
occasionally tends to be a bit cleaner as well.
</p></div><p>
Before you get going on that first Web site, I am going to direct
you to the Preferences dialog for a quick change of one of the default
settings. Click Edit, then select Preferences. A six-tabbed window appears
from which you can modify the default operation of much of the Screem's
interface and features. There is one setting that I recommend you change
right away and that's word wrap. Click the Editor tab and look for the
check box labeled Wrap lines (Figure 7). Make sure it's checked on, and
then click the Close button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10339f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. I'm
guessing you'll want to make sure word wrap is turned on in the editor's
Preferences dialog.
</p></div></div><p>
You can, if you want, take some time here to familiarize yourself
with the other settings. Before I move on, however, let me direct you to
one more that may interest you. Under the Misc tab, there is a timed
backup feature (set at ten minutes by default) that you might want to
activate. My personal favorite keyboard combination is Ctrl-S (used in
most editors), and I tend to press it every couple minutes whether I
need to or not. The autosave feature can take care of that habit.
</p><p>
The edit window, where you type your text, is that big empty space
on the left. When editing a page (Figure 8), you highlight text,
click Insert, and then select your HTML markup from the submenu. Other
markup elements, such as a link to another Web site, are best done using
the wizards. These are on the second toolbar, but also under the same
Insert menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10339f8.large.jpg"><img src="10339f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The vast majority of Screem's functions and markup are found in
the menus. The toolbars are reserved for core tools and Wizards.
</p></div></div><p>
On the right, there is a multitabbed sidebar. The tabs access
a built-in file manager, a tag tree from which you can jump to
any tag in any part of the document quickly, an attributes view that further
defines all tags and their attributes, and more.
</p><p>
As you may have noticed, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, the clock is telling us that
closing time is upon us. While my faithful waiter refills your glasses a
final time, remember this. The free and open-source software landscape
is extremely rich with countless projects and programs available for
your downloading pleasure. The easy path is certainly the one that
installs the most popular programs, such as Quanta, the KDE HTML editor,
or Bluefish, the GNOME favorite. Yet, there are many other projects, and as
with a bottle of wine, it can be fun and educational to try those you've
never encountered before. You even may discover a new favorite. Please,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, raise your glasses and let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon
app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
