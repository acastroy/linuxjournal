Not too terribly long ago, Web development literally meant learning how to
write hypertext markup language code that would format text and
graphics properly when viewed on a Web browser. We really didn't have many choices,
nor did we have very many ways to solve a problem. If you wanted your text
italicized, you surrounded it with &lt;i&gt; tags. (We won't go into the
&lt;i&gt;
versus &lt;em&gt; debates that still live on today.) The Web, however, is no
longer just a one-way information-dissemination tool. The World Wide Web
is interactive, and it's actually an application platform that holds the promise
of obscuring the underlying operating system out of existence. And, what
runs the back end for most of those Web applications? Yep. Linux. 
</p><p>
On most levels, programming for the Web is no different from programming
for an operating system. In fact, many of the same languages lend
themselves quite nicely to the Web world. We've devoted this issue to help
sort out some of the options. Whether you're an old hand looking for a few
new ideas to optimize your Web apps or someone new to Web development
looking for the right tool for the job, we think you will enjoy this
issue.
</p><p>
Reuven Lerner gives us all a lesson in jQuery. It's growing in popularity,
and Reuven shows us some reasons why. It certainly doesn't mean you have
to switch if you're already using something like Prototype, but it's
definitely something you'll want to read about. Although, perhaps
something like the Google Web Toolkit is more appealing. There's no
doubt Google knows its stuff when it comes to Web development, and using
the GWT, you can harness much of Google's power from within your Java
programs. Federico Kereki walks us through developing Web 2.0 applications
using Google's Web toolkit, again emphasizing the idea of the Web as a
&ldquo;platform&rdquo; rather than just a device for passing data.
</p><p>
One of the beauties of new Web technologies is that not only can we
create text dynamically, but we're to the point where creating dynamic
graphics is possible too. Matthew Russell shows us how to do just that
using Dojo and JavaScript. Gone are the days of static-only graphics on
Web sites.

I want to let you in on a little secret. A few paragraphs up, when I
mentioned &lt;i&gt; versus &lt;em&gt;, sadly that about summed up my Web programming
abilities. If you're in the same boat I am, fear not; we made sure to keep
this issue relevant to you as well. Marcel Gagn&eacute; highlights a handful of
HTML editors that make it easy, even for nonprogrammers, to create Web
pages. For many of us, that still suffices.

If you aren't interested in creating Webby goodness at all, every
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is designed to appeal to all our readers. Bill
Childers introduces us to an entire virtual on-line world with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Second Life</em></span>
in Linux. When you add Mick Bauer's series on Samba Security, Dave
Taylor's shell scripting, Daniel Bartholomew's reviews of the Dell Mini
9 and the Archos 5, and Kyle Rankin's tutorial on hacking apart log files,
I'm not sure how we fit everything between the covers!
</p><p>
This is a fun issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and I think it will appeal to a wide
variety of readers. Whether you're a Web programmer or a gamer, a Ruby on
Rails fan or a Netbook enthusiast, it will be a good month. &lt;i&gt; have a
&lt;strong&gt; feeling that you'll all &lt;b&gt; impressed with most of the topics
covered this month, and hopefully some of you will enjoy &lt;em&gt; all!
