After having used the internal-built G technologies with my Acer Aspire
3690, I must say with great satisfaction that the Dynex Draft N card is a
solid performer. Having used Ubuntu for two years, I'm glad to see that
wireless speeds are surpassing those of Windows. Where I live, everyone is
wired into Windows, and as an Ubuntu fan for two years, it's amazing to have
my laptop running faster than most Windows machines&mdash;as well as without the crashes
all too common with Vista, my 250GB hard drive automatically working,
my 2GB of RAM not conflicting with the system, and my Draft N card
pulling its weight. Ubuntu, by far, is one of my favorite operating
systems. I'm praying that sooner or later, all laptops and PCs are given
the options to have either Windows or Linux as their primary OS.

I'm behind in my reading and just finished &ldquo;Linux for the Long
Haul&rdquo; by Michael Surran [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, August 2008], about
the Houlton Christian Academy's migration from Windows.
Like most businesses using Linux, &ldquo;GHCA has a single Windows machine in our
office for the sole purpose of running Intuit's QuickBooks&rdquo;. Intuit has
<span   class="emphasis"><em>finally</em></span> begun to realize that its future is not on the Windows desktop. A
version QuickBooks Online that is compatible with Firefox (and other non-IE
browsers) is in the works. Now, if we can just get Photoshop....

I really liked the Tech Tip on page 56 of the December 2008 issue. Being a
bit of a bug for efficiency, I will mention one possible improvement.
However, it may work only with the Bash shell. I am not very familiar with
the other shells. I do this sort of thing because Ben Franklin once said:
&ldquo;A cycle saved is a cycle earned!&rdquo; Or something like that. I've worked on
some really slow machines in my day.
</p><p>
The line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F=$(echo $F| perl -pe 's/.gz$//') 
</pre>
</p><p>
could be replaced with the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F=${1%.gz}
</pre>
</p><p>
which allows the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F=$1
</pre>
</p><p>
to be eliminated entirely.
</p><p>
And, just because I like to be different, I think that the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nice gunzip -c $F
</pre>
</p><p>
would &ldquo;look better&rdquo; if gunzip were replaced with zcat. I think that zcat
is simply more &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; than <tt  >gunzip
-c</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nice zcat "$F"
</pre>
</p><p>
Also notice that I enclosed $F in double quotes just in case there might
be one or more blanks in the filename, which would make the unquoted $F look
like multiple arguments to the zcat.
</p><p>
Oh, and just as a question, would sed be more efficient than perl here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
F=$(echo "$F"|sed 's/.gz$//')
</pre>
</p><p>
Just curious on this last one.
</p><p>
Again, many thanks for the tip.

I really did like that tip [see letter above]. Using the idea in it, I created the following
two functions that I now sourced by my Bash profile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function do_cat()
{
 local CAT
 case "$1" in
 *.gz) CAT=zcat;;
 *.bz2) CAT=bzcat;;
 *) CAT=cat;;
 esac
 $(${CAT} "$1")
)

function smart_cat()
{
 local i
 for i in "$@"; do
 do_cat "$i"
 done
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Very thought-provoking tip! Of course, the do_cat function can be
extended to handle other cat-like commands simply by including more
entries in the case portion of the do_cat() function. I guess I could
have created only a single function of smart_cat(), but I like the
separation of using two functions.

In the December 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, the
&ldquo;Going MoBile&rdquo; interview
said that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s mobile site, <a href="http://m.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">m.linuxjournal.com</a>, ran on
Linux-based MoFuse. Instead, it runs on Drupal (as does our main site),
using a theme optimized for mobile devices.
