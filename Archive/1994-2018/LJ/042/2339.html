    Here's a company that uses Linux to set up Internet
    terminals in cybercafes.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb38580.0xc303a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you are at all interested in consumer
applications of the Internet, you have no doubt heard about
cybercaf&eacute;s and so-called &ldquo;Internet kiosks&rdquo;. Both attempt
to bring ubiquitous Internet accessibility to the general public.
In cybercaf&eacute;s, the idea is to let you browse the Internet
(or even do real work) while basking in the comfort of a familiar
caf&eacute;. Internet kiosks are supposed to be quick and
easy-to-use stations for checking e-mail or looking up a bit of
information on the Web.
</p><p>Caf&eacute; Liberty, a cybercaf&eacute; in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, was the first of its kind in the greater Boston
area, founded in the fall of 1994. From the start, we have had
several computers available for use by customers for a small hourly
fee. Our own experiences, coupled with that of other caf&eacute;
owners, eventually led us to the conclusion that there were a lot
of us interested in giving their customers Internet access, but who
had absolutely no idea how to go about it.</p><p>In March 1996, the NetPod project was born, to be funded and
managed by Caf&eacute; Liberty. We set out to build a public access
Internet terminal, a &ldquo;NetPod&rdquo;, that would allow anyone with a
dollar to surf the Web, TELNET, check e-mail or do any common
Internet function. The system had to be extremely easy to use,
foolproof, fast, reliable and painless to install in the target
site. Perhaps not surprisingly, we chose Linux for every machine in
our network. The article, &ldquo;Linux&mdash;The Internet Appliance?&rdquo; by
Phil Hughes, in the April 1997 <i  >Linux Journal</i>
struck a chord with us, since much of what he said is exactly what
we are doing. While our system is not designed for the home, it
does attempt to provide an interface that anyone can understand, it
does it on cheap hardware, it is an Internet appliance and, of
course, it runs Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb38580.0xc305b0"></a>The NetPod Interface</h2></div></div><p>In order to understand our network architecture, it's
necessary to understand what kind of services we wish to offer.
When a user approaches the NetPod, he sees a heavily modified XDM
(X Display Manager) which presents him with several options: Guest
Login, Account Login, About and Create Account (see Figure 1). The
machine costs six dollars an hour to use, paid in increments of one
dollar for ten minutes. Users insert bills into a bill validator on
the side of the NetPod (see Figure 2).</p><p><a href="2339f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Login
Screen</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2339f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
NetPod Terminal with Validator</b></span></a></p><p>A guest login provides access only to Netscape Navigator and
to TELNET, while an account (which costs three dollars a month)
also provides e-mail (both sending and receiving) and access to
Usenet newsgroups from a full news feed.</p><p>After login, the user is presented with a large Netscape
window and a tool bar on the right hand side of the screen that
lets them switch between the various parts of the system (see
Figure 3). Their remaining time is also displayed on the tool bar.
When an account holder logs out, their remaining money is kept for
their next login session. When a guest logs out, any remaining
money is lost.</p><p><a href="2339f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Netscape Window with Toolbar</b></span></a></p><p>As mentioned earlier, we used XDM for the login screen. This
is because XDM is relatively easy to modify and takes care of all
the details of logging a user in, like setting X access controls
and creating an environment. The entire login program was simply
linked to XDM through the <b  >Greet()</b> function.
Since we didn't want to deal with much of the bloat of Motif or the
complexity of the X toolkit, we designed our own library of GUI
tools for the NetPod. This let us tailor every last detail of our
system's appearance. It also let us easily construct unique
interface elements, like shaped graphic buttons, some of which can
be seen in Figure 1.</p><p>The tool bar was considerably more difficult to write. We
chose to use FVWM as a window manager because it is easily
customizable and provides a <b  >module</b> function that
allows a separate program to probe FVWM's internal window
information and structures. We configured FVWM to allow no window
movement, no special menus and no key control; in short, it was
locked up tight so the user couldn't do anything involving window
management.</p><p>The tool bar continually receives information from FVWM about
window updates so we can extract the window IDs of Netscape
windows, TELNET sessions, etc. and move around the windows when the
user clicks on the tool bar buttons.</p><p>This scheme would work fine, if Netscape were a relatively
simple program, but Netscape opens many other windows during normal
operation, such as mail and news windows, dialogs and others.
Keeping track of all these windows is a bit of a chore, and it has
only become more difficult with our recent incorporation of
Netscape Communicator, which opens far more windows than
Navigator.</p><p>Simple though it may be, many users have praised our
straightforward interface for its ease of use and its speed. People
used to sluggish Windows and Mac systems simply cannot believe
machines like ours (Pentium 100 with 16MB RAM) can be as quick and
responsive as they are&mdash;which is due in large part to our use of
Linux and the X Window System.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb38580.0xc30ce8"></a>The Network</h2></div></div><p>Our network is a mishmash of random hardware and hand-built
software. Coming into Caf&eacute; Liberty are two 384Kbps
fractional T1 lines. One runs to our ISP and provides Internet
service using the Cisco HDLC protocol. The other is a frame-relay
line that serves the NetPods. The two T1s are attached to our
router (a 486DX/40 running Linux), which also has two Ethernet
cards. One Ethernet is for the caf&eacute; (including network jacks
for public use), and the other is for NetPod machines.</p><p>You don't often hear of a single Linux box being used as a
router for multiple Ethernets and T1 lines with differing
protocols, let alone a wimpy 486DX/40. But, thanks to SDL
Communications' RISCom/N2 cards, it is possible. One RISCom/N2 with
a T1 CSU/DSU attached to its v.35 port runs the frame-relay
connection, and the other RISCom/N2csu (with built-in CSU/DSU) runs
the Cisco HDLC Internet connection.</p><p>Getting the cards up and running is mostly straightforward,
though there are many small details, like electrical
characteristics of the T1 lines, that we sometimes had to just
guess at and hope it worked. After the cards were up, routing was
easy&mdash;just compile IP forwarding into the kernel, set up some
subnets and all falls into place.</p><p>The NetPod Ethernet has only a couple of machines on it, the
most important of which is the NetPod server. The server is a
Pentium 100 (running Linux) with 32MB of RAM that deals with NetPod
mail (using ZMailer), the Usenet feed (inn), NFS serving of users'
home directories, and the NetPod database. The database, which
keeps track of user information, was custom-written and
communicates with the NetPods over encrypted channels for
security.</p><p>The server has IP firewalling turned on in full force. While
anybody can connect to the SMTP, POP and IMAP daemons, everything
else (most specifically NFS) is tightly controlled.</p><p>Each NetPod has a 56Kbps frame-relay connection. As far as we
know, we are the only Internet terminal company in the world to
have chosen frame-relay; the vast majority use standard phone lines
and a couple use ISDN. Each frame-relay line is assigned a
different PVC (Permanent Virtual Circuit) number. Their data is
consolidated and appears on the frame-relay T1 at caf&eacute;
Liberty.</p><p>Though frame-relay may seem like massive overkill for an
Internet terminal, it has enormous benefits.</p><p>Frame-relay is fast. The latency on frame-relay lines is a
lot less than a PPP connection over a modem. This translates
directly into faster TCP connection times for Netscape. We are
guaranteed 56Kbps of bandwidth, while the average 33.6Kbps or
56Kbps modem is unlikely to ever get its theoretical maximum
bandwidth.</p><p>Frame-relay is cheap. Our lines cost somewhere around $150 a
month. This may seem like a quite a premium to pay for the
comparatively mediocre speed benefits mentioned above, but remember
that Massachusetts is in NYNEX (phone company for northeast U.S.)
territory. [NYNEX, which covered the east coast of the U.S. from
Maine to New York, and Bell Atlantic, which covered from new Jersey
south to Virginia, have just merged. The combined company is Bell
Atlantic&mdash;Ed.] We have found that NYNEX would charge us
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thousands</em></span> of dollars per month for a 64Kbps
ISDN connection up 24 hours a day. The situation with standard
analog dial-ups isn't much better; there is simply no way to avoid
a ludicrous per-minute charge on business phone lines of any
type.</p><p>Thus, frame-relay was the obvious choice. Yet the startup
costs for frame-relay are crippling. One SDL RISCom/N2dds (with
built-in 56Kbps CSU/DSU) and frame-relay software costs $750. The
installation costs for the line are several hundred more. Despite
these numbers, we feel that there are very real benefits to the
frame-relay technology. Being able to remotely access the NetPods
at any time of day or night is immensely useful.</p><p>In an attempt to reduce the cost of frame-relay, we have
embarked on a side project to add frame-relay support to Linux. We
had often wondered why Linux had no frame-relay protocol driver. It
seems that the main reasons are complexity and cost. You can tell
that parts of frame-relay were designed by committee; every person
involved managed to get his or her pet feature fit in somewhere,
yet they don't all fit quite right. All the relevant standards
documents have to be purchased from the ITU (International
Telecommunications Union) and then deciphered.</p><p>We figure we can drop the cost of frame-relay about $500 if
we use a BAT Electronics CSU/DSU (the most inexpensive we could
find) and then tack on a minimalist synchronous to asynchronous
converter of our own design. This converter takes the CSU/DSU's
synchronous bitstream, repackages it in RS-232 bytes at 115,200
baud and sends it to the NetPod, which then interprets it with the
frame-relay driver. As of early June, we have established
successful TCP connections through this system, and we are now
concentrating on improving the stability and performance of the
drivers. Once they are ready for release, we will donate the
drivers to the standard kernel distribution so that any device that
generates an HDLC-framed bitstream (like Z8530-based synchronous
cards) can be used for frame-relay.</p><p>We are a 100% Linux shop. Except for some graphics work that
we do on Macintoshes to keep professional printers happy, every
last machine is a PC running Linux. Linux has given us so much
that, in the true spirit of Linux, we feel we have to give
something back to the community, which we hope to do with our
frame-relay package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb38580.0xc31268"></a>The Competition</h2></div></div><p>Though we were one of the first, we are certainly not the
only company trying to create a public Internet access solution. We
are initially targeting a small segment of the market, namely
caf&eacute;s and similar establishments, but we realize that our
system can be applied to a much broader range of sites. We feel
that we have, in a general sense, the best Internet terminal system
on the market.</p><p>We feel this way for a number of reasons. First, we have an
interface that is as idiot-proof as we can make it (Netscape
notwithstanding). We have a fast and reliable link to the Internet
that is up all the time. We provide accounts and other services
that others do not. We don't make users pay through the nose to use
our terminal.</p><p>By comparison, other Internet terminals (most of which run
Microsoft operating systems) are more geared towards giving the
user &ldquo;neat toys&rdquo; to play with, without providing any incentive to
actually <span   class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the system. In order to get these
toys, the machines have to run Windows, which means that they give
up all the benefits of Linux that we have exploited. They are
unstable and crash all the time. They do not provide an easy-to-use
interface. Billing systems are often kludged on; many systems
simply cut power to the keyboard and mouse when a user's time is
up. They provide minimal security; on virtually every terminal we
have played with, we have managed to get full administrative access
to the system in only a few minutes.</p><p>The fundamental point to remember here is that, without
Linux, we could not have done <span   class="bold"><b>any</b></span>
of this with as little capital, as little time and as few headaches
as we did. Some of it is outright impossible with any other
operating system, even other Unices. Because Linux is Unix-like, we
can control every aspect of the system. And because Linux is free,
we can do things like add our own frame-relay drivers to the kernel
with impunity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb38580.0xc31528"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Our first NetPod became available for public use at
caf&eacute; Liberty in August, 1996. After many months of feedback
from our users (and after waiting three months for NYNEX to install
our frame-relay lines), we placed two more NetPods at the Someday
caf&eacute; and Seattle Joe's caf&eacute; in the Cambridge/Boston
area in February, 1997. We are preparing for a massive set of new
sites this Fall.</p><p>Building the infrastructure for the NetPod system, both the
network and the core software, has been challenging, but we have
shown that it works, and that it works well. As we faced each
challenge, we saw that a box running Linux could provide a
solution. Now we can concentrate on adding new features to expand
the appeal of the system.</p><p>Unfortunate though it may seem, it turns out that many of our
users want to access their America Online accounts through our
NetPods. We purchased a copy of Wabi (Windows application binary
interface) through Caldera, and we have found (much to our
amazement) that it actually runs AOL's Windows software, and in
fact runs it quite well. We recently incorporated it, along with
many other new features and a streamlined, more complete set of
user tools. There are still many new features under
construction.</p><p>In short, if it involves networking, we want to add it to the
NetPod. The reason the NetPods can do what they do, and the reason
we're justified in even considering some of the crazy ideas we
have, is that we use Linux on every system in the NetPod network.
Just imagine using Windows 95 to implement multiuser access
controls over a distributed file system using frame-relay, then
switching from Netscape to an SVGAlib virtual terminal running
Quake, then to AOL running inside a Windows emulator. It should
send shivers up your spine. With Linux, it's a piece of
cake.</p><p><a href="2339s1.html" target="_self">Contacts</a></p></div></div>
