    A tutorial for beginners is presented on writing PostScript
    files to display data.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2739580.0x28313a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Alparon research group at Delft
University of Technology aims to improve automated speech
processing systems for information retrieval and information
storing dialogues. The current focus is on dialogue management for
a research project of Openbaar Vervoer Reisinformatie. The company
provides information about Dutch public transport systems, ranging
from local bus services to long -distance trains. They are capable
of giving up-to-date travel advice from any address to any other
address in the Netherlands. Last year they received over 12 million
calls for information.
</p><p>Since we use a corpus-based approach, we analyze tons of
data. Due to the size of our data we do just about everything the
Unix way: We use only stdin and stdout, and we run our scripts just
as <span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> does (Those who can't
program, write C/C++ programs; those who can, try to stick with
scripts as long as possible. See also the White Paper in the
References). Basically, we torture our data with Perl (and its
little friends like <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>, et al.) until it is in a
simple form, e.g., on each line you have an <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> value.</p><p>Although we could import this in some fancy presentation
program, we found that the generated PostScript files by these
programs are often huge. That might be okay if you have just a
couple of figures, but if you have a lot of them, you start to
wonder if there is a better way. Of course there is; you can write
the PostScript yourself, as I often do. In a Perl script I
transform the <span   class="emphasis"><em>x-y</em></span> table into PostScript. Since
LATeX requires a bounding box, I always make the PostScript level-1
compliant.</p><p>In this article I will give you a crash course in how to
write level-1-compliant PostScript&mdash;enough instruction so that you
can make your own simple figures. I will begin with the basic
operators and then we can start drawing lines, filling shapes and
drawing text. After that I will present a description of compliant
PostScript and an example. I will show you how to draw a histogram,
because a histogram has all facets: lines, shapes and text.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2739580.0x28318c8"></a>PostScript Basics</h2></div></div><p>Normally, when you wish to learn PostScript, you read the
Blue Book (see References). If you just wish to know sufficient
PostScript for most of your needs, keep on reading. PostScript is a
Turing complete stack language. The Turing complete part (well, I
am theoretical computer scientist) means that it is as powerful as
any other programming language. The stack part means that all
computations are carried out on a stack.</p><p>For instance, run Ghostscript (not Ghostview) by typing
<b  >gs</b>. The command
<span   class="bold"><b>pstack</b></span>, the basic debugging tool,
will show you the current stack. Enter <b  >1 2 3 4</b>
<b  >pstack</b> at the prompt and a new stack is
displayed.</p><p>When you type the stack operator <b  >pop</b>, 4 is
popped off the stack. Next, type <b  >exch</b>, and 2 and
3 will swap places. Another handy stack operator is
<b  >dup</b>, which duplicates the top element. The last
important stack operator is <b  >roll</b> which takes two
arguments, say <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>j</em></span>.
The command <span   class="emphasis"><em>n j</em></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>roll</b></span> (with <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>j</em></span> replaced by numbers, of course) rotates
the top <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> elements of the stack
<span   class="emphasis"><em>j</em></span> times. So if the stack shows <b  >1 3 2
2</b>, the command <b  >4 1 roll</b> outputs
<b  >2 1 3 2</b>.</p><p>PostScript also has all the normal arithmetical operators,
but since it is a stack language, you do your arithmetic in reverse
Polish notation; i.e., the operators always follow the arguments.
The standard arithmatical operators are <b  >add</b>,
<b  >sub</b>, <b  >mul</b>,
<b  >div</b>, <b  >idiv</b> (integer division),
and <b  >mod</b>. PostScript also has geometric,
logarithmic and exponential functions.</p><p>PostScript works best if you do everything on the stack, but
in some cases this isn't particularly convenient. PostScript also
has variables, but they are a bit slower than the stack. When you
start writing your own PostScript programs, you will often try to
do everything with variables&mdash;this is considered a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bad
Thing</em></span>. With some practice you will use fewer and fewer
variables. To give a variable a value you type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/PointsPerInch 72 def
</pre><p>which assigns <b  >72</b> to the variable named
<b  >PointsPerInch</b>. If you use
<b  >PointsPerInch,</b> PostScript will replace it with
72.
</p><p>In PostScript you can also define subroutines. Basically this
is the same as assigning a variable, only in this case the value is
a code chunk enclosed in curly braces. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/Inch { PointsPerInch mul } def
</pre><p>PostScript also has flow control commands which are beyond
the scope of this primer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2739580.0x28326e0"></a>Action</h2></div></div><p>Time to do something more interesting. To draw a line,
enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
newpath 100
400 moveto 300 200 lineto
        500 300 lineto stroke
</pre><p>This instruction starts a new path by moving to point (100,
400), drawing a line to point (300, 200), then to (500, 300) and,
finally, painting the current path. Without the
<b  >stroke</b> you wouldn't see a thing. Instead of
absolute positions you can also use relative movements with
<b  >rmoveto</b> and <b  >rlineto</b>. The
thickness of the lines can be controlled by the
<b  >setlinewidth</b> option, e.g., to draw a hair line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0.01 setlinewidth
</pre>


Filling shapes is also easy. Replace <b  >stroke</b> by
<b  >closepath fill</b>; the command
<b  >closepath</b> connects the last point with the first
point to form the shape and <b  >fill</b> fills the shape
with the current color or grayscale. In this case we get a black
triangle. If you do <b  >0.9 setgray</b>, the fill color
will be a light gray (0 is black and 1 is white). You can also
select colors with <b  >sethsbcolor</b> or
<b  >setrgbcolor</b>, but these options are a bit more
complicated. (For further information, see the Red Book in the
References.)
</p><p>Placing text takes some initial preparation: First select the
proper font:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/Times-Roman findfont 10 scalefont setfont
</pre><p>selects a 10-point Times-Roman font. Other well-known fonts
are Helvetica and Courier. Placing text is easy; you move to the
position where you want the text, add parentheses to enclose the
text and add the command <b  >show</b>. In the case where
the text contains parentheses or a backslash you must &ldquo;escape&rdquo;
them by inserting a backslash before the character to be escaped.
Sounds familiar, right? So the line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
400 400 moveto (Hello World) show
</pre>


prints a greeting you have seen many times before.
</p><p>There is one final command that is crucial if you want to see
anything rolling out of the printer: <b  >showpage</b>.
This command transfers the picture, made by the PostScript
interpreter of your printer, to paper and clears the memory
afterwards so that you can start a new page. The command
<b  >run</b> can be used to load your
file:<b  >(file.ps) run</b> executes the file named
file.ps.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2739580.0x2829860"></a>Compliant PostScript</h2></div></div><p>Compliant PostScript is nothing more than PostScript with
some special comments and layout instructions for your PostScript
program, so that other programs can read your PostScript program
and perform certain operations on it. There are numerous examples
of available operations: reversing the pages, scaling the pages,
rotating the pages, placing two or four pages on one page, etc.
Even the program Ghostview uses compliant PostScript, the title and
page numbers that you see are retrieved from the PostScript
comments.</p><p>Since this is all done through comments, it does not matter
to your printer if the PostScript is compliantor not&mdash;the printer
skips all comments. However, in a Unix environment it is common to
use the output of one program as the input for another. Thus, it is
quite natural not to consider a PostScript file as an end station.
In a Unix environment compliant PostScript files are a must;
otherwise, the print filters will not be able to process the
files.</p><p>In a Microsoft environment with Microsoft's well-known word
processor, PostScript is an end station. The generated output
suggests that it is level-2 compliant PostScript, but, alas, it is
not. There are so few rules to make your document level-1 compliant
(see Red Book) or even level- 2 compliant (see DSC in the
References), that you might wonder how it ever wouldn't be.</p><p>I will stick to level-1 compliant (it is a bit easier as
level-2 has more overhead). In the Red Book, level-1 compliant
PostScript is described in just eight pages; so if you want to know
all the ins and outs, it is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>right</em></span>
source.</p><p>There are three types of comments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Header comments go before any PostScript
code.</p></li><li><p>Body comments primarily serve to mark the
boundaries of pages.</p></li><li><p>Trailer comments follow all PostScript code and are
normally used to describe certain features that were not yet known
from the header comments, so they were deferred (e.g., number of
pages, fonts to be used and bounding box).</p></li></ul></div><p>Normally, a comment in PostScript starts with a
<b  >%</b> (percent symbol), but these structuring
comments start with <b  >%%</b> (or <b  >%!</b>
if it is the very first line). A <b  >%%</b> comment is
directly followed by a keyword denoting its type of structuring
comment, and if arguments are needed, they follow a
<b  >:</b>(colon) and are separated by spaces. As an
example, let's look at the following template (the number in front
of each line is just for reference):
<pre     class="programlisting">
1  %!PS-Adobe-1.0
2  %%DocumentFonts:
3  %%Title:
4  %%Creator:
5  %%CreationDate:
6  %%For:
7  %%Pages:
8  %%BoundingBox:
9  %%EndComments
</pre>


The first line suggests that these files are going to be level-1
compliant. One common misunderstanding is that people think the
<b  >1</b> in <b  >1.0</b> denotes the
compliance level, but that is not the case. Only level-1 and
level-2 compliancy exist, so even if you see
<b  >%!PS-Adobe-3.2</b> , it is not level- 3 compliant
(it should be level-2 compliant).
</p><p>The second line contains the fonts to be used in this file.
Some programs find it handy to know in the beginning which fonts
they should load. However, when you create a program that generates
PostScript, you often do not know this at this time. This header
comment can be deferred to the trailer comments. In that case you
will have to replace the <b  ><i><tt>font1
font2...</tt></i></b> part of the line in the header
with <b  >(atend)</b>.</p><p>The third line is easy;
<b  ><i><tt>text</tt></i></b> indicates the
title of the document. Often this is the file name, but it does not
have to be. Spaces in
<b  ><i><tt>text</tt></i></b> are no problem.
The fourth line is equally easy; here
<b  ><i><tt>text</tt></i></b> should be
replaced by the author or the application that created this
file.</p><p>In the fifth line
<b  ><i><tt>text</tt></i></b> should be a date
and time humans can interpret. Line 6 is optional, and
<b  ><i><tt>text</tt></i></b> should be
replaced by the intended recipient. If absent, the intended
recipient is <b  >Creator</b>.</p><p>In line 7 <b  >number</b> should reflect the number
of pages in the document. Since this number is often not known
beforehand, it is frequently deferred to the trailer comments.
Again, substitute <b  >(atend)</b> in this case.</p><p>Line 8 contains four arguments: the <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> coordinates for the lower left corner
and the upper right corner. In the case of multiple pages you
should use the bounding box, so that all pages lie in the bounding
box. To fill in the right values, you will find Ghostview very
handy. The bounding box can also be deferred to the end; again you
would specify <b  >(atend)</b>.</p><p>Finally, line 9 ends the header section. Besides line 1 and 9
the order of the other lines can be chosen as you see fit.</p><p>After the header you normally see some PostScript definitions
of variables and subroutines. These variables are intended to
remain constant throughout the rest of the PostScript
program.</p><p>Next, it is time for the body comments. The first body
comment is <b  >%%EndProlog</b>, which ends the
&ldquo;invariant&rdquo; section of the program. Most print filters leave
everything up to this line intact.</p><p>Each page is preceded by (again line numbers are only for
reference purposes):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1  %%Page:
2  %%PageFonts:
elm
</pre><p>The first line contains
<b  ><i><tt>labe</tt></i>l</b> and
<b  ><i><tt>ordinal</tt></i></b>.
<b  ><i><tt>label</tt></i></b> should be
replaced by a string, containing no white space, that indicates
which page it is. Sounds a bit weird, but this means that Roman
numerals are okay, and if you have two pages on one, then
<b  >1,2</b> or <b  >3,4</b> is a valid page
number as well. In our case, it is just a plain number. The
<b  ><i><tt>ordinal</tt></i></b> part
indicates the value of the page number. Having two types of page
numbers is just for your convenience.
</p><p>The second line is optional and describes which fonts are to
be used in the output. If absent, the fonts specified for
<b  >DocumentFonts</b> in the header are used.</p><p>Although it is not necessary, if you want to create just a
single page, the next PostScript command is
<b  >save</b>, which makes a copy of the environment you
have built so far. At the end of the page you will find the
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
restore showpage
</pre><p>This command retrieves the original situation and prints the
page. It means that anything you do between save and restore is
fair game, i.e., you can't screw up other pages if a filter
reorders the pages.
</p><p>After the final page you have <b  >%%Trailer</b>.
Most filters leave this line and everything that follows it intact.
In some PostScript programs some cleaning up occurs here, but in
most PostScript programs the trailer comments follow directly
(again, line numbers are for reference purposes):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1  %%DocumentFonts:
2  %%Pages:
3  %%BoundingBox:
</pre><p>Of these three lines, only those that were deferred in the
header comments should be included here in the trailer.
</p><p>If you want to make your PostScript level-2 compliant, you
need to read the DSC (see references).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2739580.0x282b2d8"></a>Creating a Histogram</h2></div></div><p>The first step is to torture your raw data until you get a
simple table. In practice you use Perl and friends for this step.
For the sake of demonstration I will use a tiny table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1993 9.0 8.6
1994 5.7 7.8
1995 6.4 7.1
1996 7.5 6.1
1997 8.4 5.9
</pre><p>This table has an <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>. What I wish to
draw is a light gray histogram for <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> and a dark gray one for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>. Normally, you
know the minimum and maximum values in your table, or you just use
an awk one-liner to determine those values.
</p><p>Next step is get started using a template of the Perl script,
histogram.pl, that will generate the PostScript file. This template
is shown in <a href="2386l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>One remark about the last bounding box line. This is the size
of A4 (European standard page size); for letter size you need
<b  >0 0 612 792</b>. In a later stage we will change
this line, so that the bounding box fits more tightly.</p><p>Run the script and save the output in histogram.ps. Start up
Ghostview to view this file. Not much to see, right? Time to edit
histogram.ps. It is easier to do a little experimentation with this
file rather than making changes directly to the Perl file
(especially in a later stage when you are actually processing your
data). We are going to experiment with the axes; our changes are
shown in <a href="2386l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>When you are pleased with the result, copy it into
histogram.pl just after the <b  >save</b> command and add
the line <b  >1 setlinewidth</b> to restore the original
line width. Now it is time to do the hard work: defining two
subroutines <b  >Histo-y</b> and
<b  >Histo-z</b>. Again, this normally requires some
experimentation, so create the PostScript file and edit it. We will
assume that each subroutine gets <span   class="emphasis"><em>x,y</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x,z</em></span> respectively on the stack. We will give
both histograms a border line. It often helps to put a couple of
your data points on the stack as an experiment.</p><p>You can copy your subroutines just in front of the
<b  >EndPrologue</b> line of your Perl script as shown in
<a href="2386l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p><p>Just a few words: I warned you to avoid using variables, and
I did not practice what I preached. Well, only in the case of huge
tables do you do everything on the stack. Doing so is much harder
and often not worth the effort&mdash;my time is more expensive than what
I gain in speed. Furthermore, I do some of the computations in
PostScript; usually, it does pay off to do this in your Perl
script. Finally, you normally do not want to recompute the path;
you save it. I just wanted to keep the example simple.</p><p>Now it is time to complete your Perl script and process your
data by adding the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (&lt;&gt;) {
           chomp;
           ($x, $y, $z) = split;
           print "$x $y Histo-y $x $z Histo-z\n";
   }
</pre><p>Now you can run your script with the data as stdin to create
a new histogram.ps. The final step is to determine a better
bounding box. This is where Ghostview comes into play. Go to the
leftmost and rightmost pixel of your picture and write down the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> coordinates. Now do the same for the top and
bottom of your picture, writing the <b  >y</b> values.
With these coordinates you can determine the bounding box (it does
not have to be pixel fit) <b  >83 85 400 405</b>, and you
can change it in your PostScript file. (Or in your Perl script;
however, if you have a huge data file to process, recreating the
PostScript file can take a while.)
</p><p>Now you have a fully level-1 compliant PostScript file less
than 2KB is size that you can actually understand. I have seen
PostScript files generated by applications under MS-DOS that need
2MB for the same picture. The complete Perl script and output
PostScript are included in the gzipped tar file on the ftp site as
Listings 4 and 5. The output histogram is shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2386f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Epilogue
</p></div></div><p>So from now on we do everything in PostScript, right? Wrong.
If it goes faster using another application and the generated
PostScript file is not too large, use that application. For many
pictures I still use <b  >xfig</b> or something similar.
Use PostScript directly if your data set is big and importing your
data into the application already requires a lot of work. If you
are relatively new to PostScript, concentrate on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x-y</em></span> graphics and histograms. If you have
gained some experience, read the Blue and Red Books. Most
importantly, have fun.</p><p><a href="2386s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p></div></div>
