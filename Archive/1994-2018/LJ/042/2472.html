growing&mdash;in size and in maturity. This month the Internet took a
big step toward maturity compliments of the U.S. Supreme Court. I'm
talking about the Communications Decency Act.
</p><p>At issue was an overhaul of telecommunications regulation
that included a section restricting the distribution of indecent or
&ldquo;patently offensive&rdquo; material to minors over the Internet. While
this restriction may sound reasonable to people less involved in
the Internet than your average Linux user, I think we all know that
attempting to legislate control over something with no central
control, such as the Internet, doesn't work. If there were central
control, the Internet itself couldn't work.</p><p>In what seems to be a well informed decision, the court said
that the Internet deserved full First Amendment protection,
pointing out that it was unique as a public forum for the exchange
of ideas and information. They rejected the argument that the
Internet is similar to television and radio industries. The
difference, obvious to Internet users, is that while information is
pushed at you on television, you seek information on the
Internet.</p><p>Justice Stevens said &ldquo;The [Communications Decency Act] is a
content-based regulation of speech,&rdquo; and went on to say, &ldquo;The
vagueness of such a regulation raises special First Amendment
concerns because of its obvious chilling effect on free
speech&rdquo;.</p><p>At the same time, Linux is maturing in a very good way.
First, CD distributions for the PowerPC are finally starting to
appear. In June, the Linux for PowerPC project announced another
release that supports hardware from Be Inc, Apple Computer, IBM,
Motorola and most any other manufacturer of PowerPC
computers.</p><p>The PowerPC is distinct from the MkLinux port for PowerMacs.
MkLinux is based on the Mach microkernel. This project is based on
a port of the standard Linux kernel. More information is available
at http://www.linuxppc.org.</p><p>Another way Linux is showing its maturity is by addressing
the usefulness of any computer system to people with disabilities.
One organization that is involved in this effort is the Center for
Disabled Student Services at the University of Utah. They offer a
mailing list and pointers to pages that offer access information.
You can find their web page at
http://ssv1.union.utah.edu/linux-access/.</p><p>I wasn't surprised to find software addressing use of Linux
systems by the blind including information on efforts to make
documentation on Linux available text to speech and text to braille
software. There is also a tips page on accessible web page design
and even a list of hardware and software for the blind.</p><p>Here at <i  >LJ</i> we have had inquiries over
the years about printing the magazine in braille. This has never
been practical because of the volumes involved. To address this we
have made parts of the magazine available on-line and also have
plans for a back issues CD. It is great to see that there are
Linux-based options based on Linux for the blind to access this
information.</p><p><a href="2472s1.html" target="_self">On the Cover</a></p></div></div>
