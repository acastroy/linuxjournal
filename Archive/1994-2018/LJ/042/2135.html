    An in-depth look at how the kernel is now confirming the validity of
    memory access addresses&mdash;not for the beginner. The information in
    this article applies to kernel versions 2.1.08 to 2.1.36. With version
    2.1.37, a few of the kernel internals changed. The exception handling
    did
    not change, but the compiled code would be slightly different from the
    included
    examples.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c10580.0x1d083a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>A Linux system consists of the kernel and
an assorted collection of user applications. The user applications
communicate with the kernel through system calls. System calls are
entry points into the Linux kernel which allow the application to
use services provided by the kernel. These services are often
executed on input data provided by the user application. These
input data can, on occasion, constitute a problem.
</p><p>Linux is a multiuser operating system; i.e., it supports
multiple concurrent users. It doesn't know anything about these
users or the programs they use. An erroneous or malicious
application might pass an invalid argument to a system call. If the
kernel then tries to use the invalid argument, unpredictable
behavior can occur. For that reason, the kernel must be
&ldquo;paranoid&rdquo; about the arguments of system calls and must carefully
check each argument to ensure that it neither endangers system
stability nor harms other users. This is easy for some classes of
arguments; file descriptors must be open,
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> commands must be allowed for
the specified device, etc.</p><p>One class of arguments contains pointers to the location of
input data in the address space of the application or to a buffer
that is going to receive the data of the system call. As an
example, the system call <span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>
comes to mind. One of its arguments is a pointer to a location in
the application which address space that contains the data to be
written. The kernel must confirm that the address is truly a part
of the address space of the process and does not overlap the
address range reserved for the kernel. In the case of a system call
which writes data into the user address space (for example,
<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span>), the kernel additionally has
to check that the destination address is actually writable.</p><p>In kernel versions up to 2.1.2, each user memory access had
to be guarded by a call to the function
<b  >verify_area</b>. This function checks that an
address range is valid for a certain operation (read or write). The
<b  >verify_area</b> approach has four problems:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It is slow, because the kernel has to look up the
virtual memory area covering the address range in question. Virtual
memory areas (VMA) are the data structures that the kernel uses to
keep track of the memory mapped into each process. Searching for a
certain VMA is a time-consuming process, even with an efficient
algorithm. (Linux uses Adelson-Velskii-Landis trees to optimize VMA
retrieval.)</p></li><li><p>It is normally not required, because most programs
provide valid pointers to the kernel. Despite this, the kernel has
to spend precious time for each user memory access to guard against
the rare, &ldquo;buggy&rdquo; application.</p></li><li><p>It is error prone. A programmer can easily forget
the <b  >verify_area</b> call before a user memory
access, since the address verification and the actual user memory
access are separate functions.</p></li><li><p>It is not always reliable, because in new,
multi-threaded applications the memory mapping can change between a
<b  >verify_area</b> operation and the actual user memory
access.</p></li></ol></div><p>In particular, point 4 required that a new solution be found
for verifying addresses. With the advent of real multi-threaded
programs for Linux, it was no longer just a cosmetic
problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c10580.0x1d08b88"></a>Requirements for a Better Solution</h2></div></div><p>A new solution for the problem of address verification had to
meet the following criteria:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Run as quickly as possible for the normal case of
valid addresses.</p></li><li><p>Provide an easy-to-use programming interface for
kernel programmers.</p></li><li><p>Be stable and correct for all cases.</p></li></ol></div><p>Instead of implementing the address test in software, points
1 and 3 of the requirements best met by giving the virtual memory
hardware (present in all Linux-capable hardware) the real work.
Point 2 resulted in a merge of the access check and the actual
memory access into a single access function.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c10580.0x1d08f50"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>The implementation relies on the MMU (memory management unit)
to do the right thing. Whenever the software tries to access an
invalid address, the MMU delivers a page-fault exception. This is
true not only for user applications, but also for the kernel. If
the kernel tries to perform an invalid memory access, a special
handler intercepts the resulting exception and fixes the access.
Because the handler is only invoked for problematic cases, the
normal memory access has almost zero added overhead. Some
experimental implementations of the new user memory access scheme
have been done by Linus in kernel versions 2.1.2 to 2.1.6. They
proved that this scheme works in the real world, but has a rather
clumsy API inside the kernel. For Linux 2.1.7 Richard Henderson
implemented the current, much-improved version introduced in this
article. It is now available for most of the architectures
supported by Linux. I use the x86 implementation as an example; the
code for the other supported architectures is very similar.</p><p>In this new version, only the macros and functions in the
machine-specific header file uacess.h are allowed to access the
user address space. There are functions and macros to handle
zero-terminated strings, to clear memory areas, and to copy single
values to and from the kernel. One of the macros is
<b  >get_user</b>, which is called with two arguments:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>val</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>addr</em></span>. It copies a
single data value from the user space address
<span   class="emphasis"><em>addr</em></span> to the variable <span   class="emphasis"><em>val</em></span>.
On success, it returns the value 0, on failure -EFAULT (&ldquo;bad
address&rdquo;). Its source code in the file uacess.h is somewhat hard
to understand and even harder to explain.</p><p>Instead, I will track down a usage example from the function
<b  >rs_ioctl</b> in drivers/char/serial.c. The line of
source code in the kernel is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
error = get_user(arg, (unsigned int *) arg);
</pre><p><a href="2135l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 1. C
Compiler Output</b></span></a></p><p>Looks innocent, doesn't it? Well, Listing 1 shows what the C
compiler makes of this code. Let's do a line-by-line walk-through,
beginning with the register assignments. On output, register ECX
contains the value read from the user address space, and register
EDX contains the error code of the access operation. Register EBX
holds the address of the value to be read. Line 01 initializes the
error code with <b  >-EFAULT</b>. In line 02, the
resultant value is set to 0.</p><p>In lines 03 to 07, the kernel does the checking which ensures
that the address in register EBX does not overlap with kernel
memory. First, it checks if the access is from inside the kernel.
This situation can occur when the kernel itself invokes a system
call (for example, in the NFS client implementation). In this case,
access is always granted. If the access is from outside the kernel,
it checks that the given address range does not overlap the range
reserved for the kernel.</p><p>In Linux, the kernel address space is mapped into the address
space of every process. The kernel memory starts at address
0xC0000000. If a user program were allowed to pass a pointer to an
address in kernel memory as an argument to a system call, the
access by the kernel would not cause a page-fault exception. This
in turn would allow the user program to overwrite kernel data. In
our example (integer access = 4 bytes), the highest possible
address a user process is allowed to access is 0xC0000000 - 4 =
0xBFFFFFFFC = -1073741828. Every address larger than this touches
kernel memory and is therefore invalid. If memory addresses are
invalid, execution continues at label .L2395 in line 21.</p><p>Now that the preliminaries are over, we prepare to access the
data pointed to by EBX. Assuming that the access will be
successful, we set register EDX to 0 (line 09). In line 10 the
actual access takes place. Note that the address of the instruction
that might fault is tagged with the local label 1. The following
code in the lines 13 to 15 unconditionally set the error code to
<b  >--EFAULT</b>, the resultant value to 0, and jumps
back to local label 2 in line 16. This looks like an infinite
loop&mdash;it isn't.</p><p>Another important decision that Linus made at the beginning
of the 2.1 development cycle was to completely abandon the a.out
executable file format for kernel development in favor of the more
modern ELF. Normally, ELF is only associated with easily shared
library support for user applications. However, that's only one of
its nice features. Another one is that ELF binaries (both object
files and executables) can have an arbitrary number of named
sections.</p><p>The <b  >.section&nbsp;.fixup,&nbsp;"ax"</b>
command in line 12 instructs the assembler to place the following
code in the ELF section named <b  >.fixup</b>. In line
16, we switch back to the previous code section; normally this is
<b  >.text</b>. This means that the assembler moves the
code from lines 13 to 15 in the generated object file out of the
normal execution path. Lines 17 to 20 accomplish a similar task by
instructing the assembler to place two long values into the ELF
section called <b  >__ex_table</b>. These two values are
initialized to the address of the instruction that might fault
(label 1 backward, 1b) and the address of the fixup code (label 3
backward, 3b).</p><p>With the help of the command
<span   class="bold"><b>objdump</b></span>, which is one of the GNU
utilities, we can examine the internal structure of the linked
kernel. See <a href="2135l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Internal Kernel
Structure</a>.</p><p><a href="2135l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing 3.
Code Left in Normal Execution Path</b></span></a></p><p>As expected, there are two sections named
<b  >.fixup</b> and <b  >__ex_table.</b>
<span   class="bold"><b>objdump</b></span> also shows us the code
which remains in the normal path of execution. Looking at Listing
3, we can see that the whole user memory access is reduced to just
12 machine instructions. The code originally bracketed with the
<b  >.section</b> directives is now in the section
<b  >.fixup</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c01a16bf &lt;.fixup+17b3&gt; movl   $0xfffffff2,%edx
c01a16c4 &lt;.fixup+17b8&gt; xorl   %ecx,%ecx
c01a16c6 &lt;.fixup+17ba&gt; jmp    c018fafd &lt;rs_ioctl+359&gt;
</pre><p>The ELF section <b  >__ex_table</b> contains pairs
of addresses bracketed by &lt;&gt;: the faulting instruction
address and the matching fixup code address. In our example, we
expect the pair &lt;c018fafb,c01a16bf&gt;. Using the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
objdump --section=__ex_table --full-contents\
        vmlinux
</pre>


and a small program to swap bytes from internal representation to a
human-readable form gives us this output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
c018f292 c01a1699 c018f51d c01a16a5
c018f5a5 c01a16ad c018fad0 c01a16b5
c018fafb c01a16bf c018fc5b c01a16cb
c018fd02 c01a16d5 c018fd72 c01a16e1
c018ff5a c01a16e9 c018ff7b c01a16f3
</pre>


Now we have all the pieces we need to assemble the final picture.
When the kernel accesses an invalid address in user space, the MMU
generates a page-fault exception. This exception is handled by the
page-fault handler <b  >do_page_fault</b> in the C file
arch/i386/mm/fault.c. <b  >do_page_fault</b> first
obtains the unaccessible address from the CPU control register CR2.
It then looks for a VMA in the current process mappings that
contains the invalid address. If such a VMA exists, the address is
within the virtual address space of the current process. The fault
probably occurred, because the page was not swapped in or was write
protected. In this case, the Linux memory manager takes appropriate
action. However, we are more interested in the case in which the
address is not valid&mdash;there is no VMA that contains the address. In
this case, the kernel jumps to the <b  >bad_area</b>
label.
</p><p>At this point, the kernel calls the function
<b  >search_exception_table</b> to look for an address at
which the execution can safely continue (fixup). Since every
faulting instruction has an associated fixup handler, this function
uses the value in <b  >regs-&gt;eip</b> as a search
key.</p><p>Loadable kernel modules in Linux complicate matters. After
insertion at runtime, they are effectively part of the running
kernel and can access user memory just as any other part of the
kernel. For that reason, they have to be integrated into the
exception-handling process. Kernel modules must provide their own
exception tables. On insertion, the exception table of a module
gets registered with the kernel. Then
<b  >search_exception_table</b> can look through all of
the registered tables, performing a binary search for the faulting
instruction.</p><p>To access the start and the end of an exception table, we use
a feature of the linker which resolves a symbol name consisting of
the name of a section prepended with <b  >__start__</b>
or <b  >__stop__</b> to the start or end address of the
section in question. This feature allows us to access the exception
table from C code. If <b  >search_exception_table</b>
finds the address of the faulting instruction, it returns the
address of the matching fixup code.
<b  >do_page_fault</b> then sets its own return address
to the fixup code and returns. In this way, the exception handler
gets executed. The exception handler sets the value we tried to get
to 0 and the return value of the <b  >get_user</b> macro
to <b  >-EFAULT</b>. Then it jumps back to the address
immediately after the failed user memory access. It is the task of
the surrounding code to report the failure back to the user
application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c10580.0x21025e8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The new user access scheme implemented in the 2.1 development
kernels of Linux provides an efficient and easy-to-use way to copy
data from and to the kernel address space. The added overhead for
the average, error-free case is close to zero. Because access and
test for accessibility are atomic, the original problem with
multi-threaded applications is resolved. This solution meets all
four of our requirements.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2135f1.large.jpg"><img src="2135f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
