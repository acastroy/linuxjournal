    Linux servers and applications are being used in Denmark to
    provide an interactive teletext system for TV viewers and to
    offer phones and movies to hospital patients.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x222c580.0x2324558"></a></h2></div></div><p>In a modest building outside Copenhagen,
Grundig TV-Communications engineers Niels Svennekjaer and Peter
Hansen tend to the information needs of Danish hospital patients
and TV viewers, monitoring and making fixes to Linux-based
applications running on PCs. In the basement, a Linux server hosts
an interactive teletext system. Television viewers phone this
system and navigate a Raima database of classified ads, horoscopes,
job listings and other information, entering their choices through
the telephone keypad and receiving text responses on their TV
screens. Already, Denmark's TV2 nation-wide broadcaster and several
local stations have adopted this technology; the government
unemployment bureau recently made it the official channel for job
listings.
</p><p>In a hardware-cluttered office upstairs, Svennekjaer phones
in via modem and fine-tunes a Linux server at a local hospital.
This application makes amenities such as phones and pay-per-view
movies available in Denmark's highly efficient (yet somewhat
spartan) hospital system and has already been sold to five
hospitals in Scandinavia. Grundig TV-Communications' vision
includes taking this system into Poland and the Baltic
nations.</p><p>Is the quintessential hacker's operating system making
inroads at one of the Europe's largest electronics manufacturers?
At Grundig TV-Communications, a Danish outpost of the large German
firm Grundig AG, Linux has become the standard platform for
information-on-demand applications. Grundig TV-Communications likes
the freely distributable operating system's low cost, robustness
and the availability of tools. They are also impressed by its
support&mdash;not from a raft of engineers on call at a vendor's
headquarters, but from the multitude of other Linux users who can
be reached via the Internet.</p><p>Grundig has chosen Linux for its new hospital and
broadcasting systems and will likely move to Linux with its core
product, a hotel teletext system serving some 200,000 rooms in
Europe and Asia. It has also standardized on Raima's embedded
database as the data management component in its applications. Both
the hospital and broadcasting applications use Raima Database
Manager++, a low-level database tailored to the needs of C and C++
programmers. In the next step of their evolution, these products
will move to a client/server architecture with Raima's Velocis
Database Server. Svennekjaer believes this redesign will better
support the heavier load of concurrent users and more complex
queries the applications are beginning to experience.</p><p>Teletext is largely unknown in the United States, but it is
widely used in Europe, where viewers obtain sports scores, news
updates and other text by tuning into special channels. This
service is supported by a band of the broadcast spectrum that
governments set aside for teletext and other special purposes, such
as remote equipment maintenance.</p><p>Grundig TV-Communications goes well beyond these usually
passive teletext services by adding a dimension of user
interaction. When viewers call into the server, a personal &ldquo;page&rdquo;
appears on their screen. From that page they begin navigating the
Raima database. A user might first request all real estate
listings, then &ldquo;drill down&rdquo; to two bedroom, waterfront holiday
homes on the Jutland peninsula. At TV2 the resulting data streams
are sent from a Pentium server PC to one of 16 inserter PCs placed
in TV station broadcast towers at different locations in the
country, where they are mixed with the broadcast signal.</p><p>The revenue from this application comes from content
providers, who pay for their data to be accessible in Grundig's
Linux server. Television advertisers frequently provide teletext
codes for obtaining more information, and the server's peak loads
occur when commercials are particularly successful in drawing
viewers. The server and database respond to requests for some
200,000 pages of information per day.</p><p>For the hospital application, Grundig TV-Communications
provides tape-deck-sized panels which sit next to the patient's
bed. When they check in, patients receive &ldquo;smart cards&rdquo; to insert
in these panels to activate their personal television, telephone
and radio accounts. Listening to the radio is free, but patients
pay by the minute for phone and TV and per-movie for videos. Most
are happy to pay. Danish medicine is of high quality, but the
government-run system provides few amenities&mdash;nurses wheeling
trolleys of shared phones are still a common sight in many
hospitals, according to Svennekjaer.</p><p>A Linux-based application controls access to these services
and monitors patient usage and billing. Grundig shares the revenues
from this application with two partner companies which handle
marketing, installation and billing. So far, hospitals earn no
money from the application, but they benefit from having happier
patients.</p><p>The multi-user, multi-tasking demands of these applications
made Unix a natural choice of operating systems, Svennekjaer says.
Interactive Unix, their first platform, was produced by an
independent vendor, sold to Kodak, then sold to Sun. The Grundig
team felt this platform's future was uncertain and decided to
switch. For cost reasons, they wanted to use PCs, so they evaluated
SCO and Solaris. About the same time, Svennekjaer says, some of his
friends were &ldquo;playing around&rdquo; with Linux version 0.99 at the
Aalborg University Center in Denmark. They recommended that he try
this unknown (to Svennekjaer) Unix. &ldquo;We ported our application to
Linux in one week, and it worked. And it was free!&rdquo; Svennekjaer
recalls.</p><p>But did the freely distributable operating system make sense
for commercial applications targeted at hundreds of deployment
sites? When the Grundig TV-Communications team weighed the risks
and rewards, Linux looked better than the alternatives. First,
there was the price tag of approximately $2,000 per site for a
commercial release of Unix versus $20 apiece for CD-ROMs with the
complete Linux system plus ample tools, add-ons and
enhancements.</p><p>And what about the frequently-voiced concern that Linux is an
&ldquo;unsupported&rdquo; operating system? The idea of support, it turns
out, is relative for developers working far away from the OS
vendors&mdash;or perhaps for any developers making especially complex
system demands. Svennekjaer notes that in the past he relied on
local distributors of commercial software products for help. When
his dealer couldn't help him with a stack overflow, the $2,000 he
spent on a supposedly &ldquo;supported&rdquo; product started looking like
money wasted.</p><p>In contrast, with Linux &ldquo;we get the source code, so we can
address problems directly when they come up,&rdquo; he says. In
addition, when particularly difficult issues arise, Svennekjaer
posts his questions to one of the many Linux newsgroups on the
Internet. &ldquo;Usually the next day we have five answers&rdquo; from Linux
programmers around the world, many of whom are intimately familiar
with the source code.</p><p>For example, Svennekjaer uses a RAID with four
hotplug/hotswap disks as backup for the teletext application, in
case its hard drive fails. Distributed Processing Technologies
(DPT), the manufacturer of the SCSI disk-controller for the RAID,
did not provide a Linux driver at that time, but one was included
with the kernel source of Svennekjaer's Linux distribution.
However, after moving to an updated version of the disk-controller,
Svennekjaer experienced problems with the old driver. So he tracked
down the driver's author, Michael Neuffer, from an e-mail address
listed in the driver source, obtained an updated version and was
back on track within days. (Since that time, DPT has begun
distributing a Linux driver developed by a third party.)</p><p>According to Svennekjaer, the problem with Linux tools is not
lack of availability, it's that there are so many that it's
distracting&mdash;CAD/CAM programs, ray-tracing software, biomolecular
analysis programs, diagram editors, multi-user games, web servers
and other interesting free or demo packages announced in
comp.os.linux.announce.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2242f3.jpg"></div><p>While Svennekjaer downloads many of his Linux-based tools for
free, his firm has opted for commercial database technology, first
with Raima Database Manager++ and later with Velocis Database
Server, an SQL client/server DBMS that evolved from the RDM++
technology. Velocis and RDM++ are unique in that they support
database architectures using the relational database model, network
database model and combinations of both models. This flexibility
can be useful. Relational &ldquo;keyed&rdquo; data access is typically better
for finding randomly selected records, while the network model is
faster when retrieving related records or drilling down through
hierarchical data, as is often the case for users of the teletext
application.</p><p>The current applications based on RDM++ enable multiple
processes to access the database. The move to client/server is
intended to support even heavier usage, as both the hospital and
teletext systems scale up to serve thousands of users, and as these
users generate more complex queries.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2242f4.jpg"></div><p>Client/server architecture will centralize database
processing on the server, thus reducing network traffic. It will
also improve concurrency, the ability of multiple processes to
share data. In databases, concurrency is regulated by locking
whereby a certain portion of the database is made off limits to
other processes while a single process accesses it. Like most
file-server architecture database management systems, Raima
Database Manager++ provides file-level or table-level locking&mdash;a
data file or database table is the typical unit that is locked.
Velocis, on the other hand, provides row-level locking, in which a
much smaller unit (data files or tables are made up of many rows)
is made unavailable to other processes. It also includes features
for protecting the integrity of transactions, such as
&ldquo;roll-forward recovery&rdquo;, in which related changes to the database
are completed only as a unit, even if the system goes down during a
transaction.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2242f5.jpg"></div><p>In the future, the teletext application will offer more
demanding services, like providing a calculator so a user can
figure out the monthly payments on a car with a specific price,
interest rate and down payment. Grundig TV-Communications also
wants to let users customize their queries. In the past, the
Grundig team has &ldquo;hard-wired&rdquo; its calls to the database, coding
them in C function calls that are embedded in the application.
However, the introduction of Velocis will add SQL capabilities to
the system. SQL is a high-level database query language that can be
used to give end-users the ability to define their own
queries.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2242f6.jpg"></div><p><a href="2242s1.html" target="_self">What's It?</a></p><p>For example, a user might want to view listings for all cars
with air conditioning in a particular price range and within a
particular geographic area. As more possible variables exist for a
search, much more complex queries can be defined. Offering SQL will
let users search using their own criteria, eliminating the Grundig
TV Communications' engineers need to define all queries in advance.
It's one more step toward making information truly available on
demand.</p><p>
