Programming Tools</em></span> and the author's introduction seem to
indicate in-depth coverage, this book is really an introduction. In
fact, the discrepancy between what is really covered and the
implied coverage is my major gripe&mdash;but I'll take that up later.
First, let's take a quick run-through of what a reader can
expect.</p><p>The book itself is divided into three major sections:
&ldquo;Building Programs&rdquo; (Chapters 1-6), &ldquo;Maintaining Programs&rdquo;
(Chapters 7-11) and &ldquo;Documenting Your Work&rdquo; (Chapters
12-13).</p><p>Chapter One gives a very brief introduction to Unix,
including some basic shell commands and utilities. Chapter Two
whisks you through the process of compiling and linking C and C++
programs and creating libraries. For anything beyond the basics,
you'll need to consult the man pages. An example is given for
creating and running a Java program, and Perl and Tcl are briefly
discussed.</p><p>Chapter Three outlines the basics of using
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> to automate the build
process. There is enough information here for the newcomer to begin
creating and using their own Makefiles. The commands
<span   class="bold"><b>imake</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xmkmf</b></span> are given brief treatment,
but not enough for the neophyte to begin comfortably using
them.</p><p>In the Chapter Four, &ldquo;Working with Text Files&rdquo;, you can
expect to be shown how to invoke vi or Emacs on text files, and you
are provided with a few tables of the common editing commands for
each editor. A handful of graphical editors are mentioned and a few
screen-shots of these editors are provided. The chapter finishes
with passing mention of <span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span>.</p><p>Chapter Five is primarily an introduction to the
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> commands, though again, the
coverage is limited. The examples of using grep all focus on
finding literal text. Regular expressions are mentioned and a few
character classes are shown, but with the caveat that such
expressions are beyond most grep usage.</p><p>The sixth and final chapter of the first section covers
installation. Here you are introduced to
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>shar</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>uuencode</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>compress</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>install</b></span> program is mentioned as an
alternative to using tar in some situations, as well.</p><p>Section Two begins with Chapter Seven looking at the
debuggers: <b  >dbx</b>, <b  >gdb</b> and
<b  >xdb</b>. You are shown how to compile with debugging
turned on and how to get a stack trace, set a breakpoint and print
variable values. A few graphical front ends are mentioned with
screen-shots, and the C language debugger <b  >lint</b>
and a few memory checking utilities are mentioned. The chapter
finishes with a quick run through of the Java debugger
<b  >jdb</b>.</p><p>Chapter Eight offers basic information on
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> and related programs, and
instructions on using the <span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span>
program.</p><p>Chapter Nine, on version control, is probably the best
chapter in the book. This chapter begins with the barest essentials
of using RCS and moves on to list the important commands and uses
of RCS. Although the author gives the impression that RCS
sub-directories must be used to work with RCS, the coverage is more
than enough for a newcomer to begin applying version control to
their projects.</p><p>The remaining two chapters in Section Two very briefly
discuss cross-platform development and using
<span   class="bold"><b>prof</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gprof</b></span> to check program
performance. These chapters, like earlier ones, provide neither
breadth nor depth in their coverage.</p><p>The final section of the book is on documentation, with
Chapter 12 focusing on man pages and Chapter 13 on documentation in
HTML format. In Chapter 12 you are shown the basic formatting
commands for creating a man page and given an example that can be
used as a template.</p><p>Chapter 13 appears more focused on source code documentation
and shows how one can use the tools
<span   class="bold"><b>cocoon</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>cxref</b></span> to produce HTML formatted
documentation from C++ header files or C source and header files
respectively&mdash;as long as a specialized format for comments is used
in those files. A similar tool for Java programs,
<span   class="bold"><b>javadoc</b></span>, is also introduced in
this chapter.</p><p>The chapter ends with a discussion of POD documentation for
Perl scripts, but as POD is actually a method for easily generating
man-pages, it would have made more sense to put this discussion in
the previous chapter. Notably lacking in Chapter 13's discussion of
documentation was any mention at all of Literate Programming
techniques and tools. While Literate Programming is not mainstream,
I see this as an unfortunate omission of a powerful set of tools
and techniques.</p><p>As mentioned above, there is a definite discrepancy between
what the covers of the book and the author's introduction claim,
and what is actually covered in the book. The best example of this
is the statement on the front cover: &ldquo;Covers Perl, Tcl, Java,
Emacs, make, sed, awk, grep, C, C++ and more.&rdquo; In actuality, awk
appears just twice in the book&mdash;once on page 110: &ldquo;awk is another
text file tool, although it's mostly used for creating files or
reports on data kept in files.&rdquo;; and once in the index,
referencing page 110. <span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> gets
three full sentences, also on page 110. Perl's coverage is limited
to showing how to invoke perl on a script, or how to use the
<b  >#!</b> notation to create an executable script.
Notably absent is any mention of Perl's built-in interactive
debugging environment.</p><p>On the back cover you are told that you will find out how to
&ldquo;get the most out of your text editor&rdquo;. However, in reality, only
a basic introduction to <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Emacs</b></span> is provided in Chapter Four.
In subsequent chapters, there are occasional passages on
integrating these editors (mainly Emacs) with some of the other
tools, but don't expect to get the most out of either of these
editors with just the information contained in this book.</p><p>In the introduction, the author suggests that the book will
be useful to newcomers and &ldquo;hard-core UNIX developers&rdquo;, and that
this book will cover all the &ldquo;nitty-gritty details&rdquo;. However, in
the summary of Chapter Two, he gives us the following description:
&ldquo;Well, that's the whirlwind tour of creating C, C++, Java, Perl
and Tcl programs on Unix.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whirlwind Tour&rdquo; is an apt
description for this book's coverage of Unix programming
tools.</p><p>Most of the tools discussed in this book are available on the
included CD-ROM, but then, most of them are included on most Linux
CD-ROM distributions or are easily obtained from Linux archives. A
similar level of introduction to many of the tools in this book can
also be found in some of the introductory Linux books (see Other
Resources), which have the added benefit of providing greater
detail on the Unix/Linux environment in general.</p><p>For those wanting better coverage of the major programming
tools, as well as an exploration of some programming issues in the
Unix/Linux environment (such as terminal programming, sockets,
semaphores, pipes, data management and more), I would suggest
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Linux Programming</em></span> (see Other
Resources), which, as its title suggests, is suitable for those new
to Unix programming, but offers far more information than the book
reviewed here.</p></div></div>
