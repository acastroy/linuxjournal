set it up so that the new user can dial into our regular hunt
group? The way I have it set up now, I would need to assign each
user a modem just for them. I was told that I can set things up so
users can call into our main hunt group number. &mdash;John Jhong Red
Hat</p><p>That is exactly what we do here at Red Hat. We have a
four-line hunt group for which we give users the number only to the
first line. Then we put a modem on each of the four lines. If the
first line is occupied, the caller is rolled to the second, then
the third, then the fourth. I assume this is what you mean by
&ldquo;hunt group&rdquo;.</p><p>All of our users have a static IP number, too. We simply
create an extra account for each user. In typical ISP fashion, we
usually make it their normal login ID preceded by a capital
&lt;\#145&gt;P'. (For example Pdjb would be the dial in account for
djb). Next, we create a short shell script that is set up as the
&ldquo;shell&rdquo; for Pdjb. A typical script might look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
/usr/sbin/pppd modem crtscts netmask \
255.255.255.248 :static.ip.address.here
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>We would put that in
/usr/local/bin/Pdjb.</em></span>
</p><p>Next, you make that script executable and edit the shell for
your Pdjb user to look like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Pdjb:fakepasswd:1000:1000:RHS ppp account:
     /home/ppp:/usr/local/bin/Pdjb
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Then the user can dial in directly as Pdjb and PPP
will start automatically. This is only a brief introduction to
setting up PPP. For more detailed information, see Robert Hart's
PPP-HOWTO available at http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP. &mdash;Donnie Barnes,
Red Hat Software redhat@redhat.com</em></span>

  &ldquo;Socket operation on non-socket&rdquo; &mdash;Ian Webber Slackware 3.2</p><p>Those aren't programs. They are daemons. They should be run
only from <b  >inetd</b>, which is a &ldquo;master daemon&rdquo;
that runs all the time, listening for things like
<span   class="bold"><b>FTP</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span> requests. You will find
configuration information for inetd in /etc/inetd.conf.</p><p>Once inetd receives a request for FTP or telnet, it will then
start <span   class="bold"><b>in.ftpd</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>in.telnetd</b></span> and connect its I/O to
the socket that requested the connection. With this system, you
don't need to have many daemons sitting in memory doing nothing,
since inetd can start them when they are needed. &mdash;Donnie Barnes,
Red Hat Software redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecd580.0xfc5870"></a>I Still Can't Print!</h2></div></div><p>I have friends who chuckle at me because I have had Linux for
about a year and still can't figure out how to get it to print to
my HP printer. &mdash;Randy Barrett Red Hat 3.0.3</p><p>Since you don't specify the model of your HP (and you've been
trying for so long) I'll assume it is a 540 or similar printer.
What you need to do is download the printing filter
<span   class="bold"><b>aps-491.tgz</b></span> in
/pub/Linux/system/printing from sunsite (or your favorite mirror).
All you need to know is to which lp port your printer is connected.
The APS Filter installation software will automatically write the
filter and set up /etc/printcap so that you can start using your HP
printer.  &mdash;Mark Bishop, Vice President Southern Illinois Linux Users
Group mark@vincent.silug.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecd580.0xfc5a28"></a>XView Shuts Down Monitor</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes when I start the
<span   class="bold"><b>XView</b></span> application by typing
<b  >openwin</b>, the monitor turns off. Since the
monitor power supply is the same as that of the whole system, I
need to start all over again.</p><p>I have tried various combinations with the
  <b  >XConfig</b> file.  &mdash;Harjeet</p><p>I recommend downloading
<span   class="bold"><b>XFree3.3</b></span> from ftp.xfree86.org or
your favorite mirror. Read the RELNOTES file before you download
anything. XFree 3.3 has a pretty decent tool
(<span   class="bold"><b>XF86Setup</b></span>) that you run to set up
XFree for operation with your particular video card. Once you get
XFree up and running by entering <b  >startx</b>, XView
should pop up with no problem. &mdash;Mark Bishop, Vice President
Southern Illinois Linux Users Group mark@vincent.silug.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecd580.0xfc5df0"></a>Linux C Graphic Libraries</h2></div></div><p>I just switched over to Linux to do my graphics programming.
I cannot find basic Linux C libraries that are equivalent to the
Turbo C++ version of C graphic libraries. Where can I find
those? &mdash;Christopher Carver Red Hat 4.0</p><p>There is no direct freeware clone of the Borland BGI graphics
library, but there are a number of libraries that should serve your
purposes, whether you want to display a few curves on the screen or
render complex 3D images. Visit your favorite Sunsite mirror, and
explore the /pub/linux/libs/graphics directory. You should find
everything you need. If you are looking for a direct clone of the
BGI graphics library, look for the file
<span   class="bold"><b>bgi_library.tar.gz</b></span> which you
should also find in the aforementioned sunsite location. It is a
good shareware product (with an extended commercial version) that
provides source API compatibility. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical
Services Corporation chadr@brttech.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xecd580.0xfc5fa8"></a>Archive Site for Kernel Development</h2></div></div><p>Where is an there an archive site for kernel source code and
  documentation for developing the Linux Kernel? &mdash;Jung-Ho Park Red Hat
4.1</p><p>The Kernel Hacker's Guide is a document written just for this
purpose. You can find it on your favorite Sunsite mirror in
/pub/linux/docs/kernel in the subdirectory kernel-hackers-guide.
There is other documentation in this directory that may be of
assistance to you. Also, the Usenet newsgroup
comp.os.linux.development.system has ongoing discussion of kernel
development issues. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services
