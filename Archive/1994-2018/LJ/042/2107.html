    A gentle introduction to Sun Workstations and installing Red Hat
    Linux SPARC 4.0.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1fa94a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many PC users have taken the plunge into
the Unix world with Linux and, I imagine, quite a few Unix
die-hards like me have taken their first, faltering steps with PC
hardware, using Linux, too. I have to say that for a long-time Sun
user, the attempted transition to PCs was not without its trials.
The mysterious workings of BIOS and extended-vs-expanded memory
still elude me, so it was with more than a little relief that I
noted, towards the end of last year, the release of Red Hat 4.0 for
the SPARC architecture. Now we Sunnites can run our favourite OS on
our favourite hardware, and the PC folks have a chance to run a
familiar OS on what many may have, until recently, considered
rather exotic hardware. Many institutions are selling off, or even
scrapping, their first generation SPARCs as they become less and
less useful when running the relatively &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; OS which Sun now
ships. Many of these workhorses are becoming available to the
individual user at little or no cost, and Linux provides an ideal
solution to the question of which OS to use.
</p><p>SPARCstations generally offer better performance than a PC of
equivalent age and come with a relatively standard set of
peripherals and interfaces. Among the benefits are a much higher
screen resolution than the old VGA-based 386 machines (the standard
resolution for Suns is 1152x900) and built-in audio, Ethernet and
SCSI controllers.</p><p>In this article I hope to introduce those readers unfamiliar
with Sun hardware to a few of the peculiarities of the breed,
provide pointers to which systems are good buys and which should be
avoided, and to provide enough information for you to get Red Hat's
SPARC distribution up and running on your machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1fa9660"></a>Shopping For SPARCs</h2></div></div><p>What systems are out there and what should you look for when
shopping for a Sun workstation on which to run Linux?</p><p>First of all, several groups of machines are not currently
supported under Red Hat Linux/SPARC and will not work under the 4.0
or 4.1 releases.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>None of the VME-based deskside or server machines
are supported (i.e., the 400 and 600 series).</p></li><li><p>The SS1000 and SS2000 servers are not
supported.</p></li><li><p>The newer &ldquo;Ultra&rdquo; based machines are not
supported.</p></li></ul></div><p>I should emphasize here that SPARC Linux is one of the
platforms where changes are happening very rapidly (kudos to the
dedicated band of portmeisters), and I expect that by the time that
you actually read this an Ultra version will be available. However,
the Red Hat version 4.0 and 4.1 releases discussed here do not
support that architecture.</p><p>More recent desktop machines, the Classic and SPARCstations
10 and 20 (all &ldquo;4m&rdquo; architecture), run SPARC Linux quite happily,
and the testing and boot details given later in this article are
generally valid for them. However, it's unlikely that the average
home user will come across one of these machines on the market at a
price which he'd be willing to pay for an unfamiliar piece of
hardware, so I'd like to concentrate here on the machines which
you're most likely to encounter, the older, &ldquo;4c&rdquo; architecture
systems.</p><p>First, you need to be aware that several of Sun's chassis
will accommodate several different types of CPU. A good example of
this is the original &ldquo;pizza box&rdquo; SPARCstation enclosure (about
the same size as a large size pizza delivery box, with a
distinctive &ldquo;dimple&rdquo; pattern on the front and cooling holes in
the same pattern on the sides). This chassis was virtually
unchanged between several different models, the SPARCstation 1, 1+
and 2 (the SPARCstation 2 had a small fan and a floor grille added
for disk cooling).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1fa9b30"></a>A Sheep In Wolf's Clothing</h2></div></div><p>Unfortunately for potential buyers, this chassis also
accommodates the Sun 3/80 CPU. The 3/80 is 68030 based (not SPARC)
and, at the moment, no Linux port is available for it. Unless
you're intent on joining the band of volunteers working on the Sun3
porting project, you do not want to buy a 3/80 in SPARCstation
clothing. Don't accept that the logo on the front of the machine
actually reflects what is inside. Take a good close look at the
business end of the CPU. Even if you can't open the case to check
the CPU chip, a dead give-away that the machine is actually a 3/80
is the presence of a 9-pin D-type serial port on the CPU. None of
the desktop SPARCstations has this type of connector, although
most, including the 3/80, have a 15-pin D-type Ethernet connector,
so count those pins.</p><p><a href="2107f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Red
Hat Release &amp; SPARCstation 1+</b></span></a></p><p>Any of the other machines mentioned above, the SPARCstation
1, 1+ or 2, will run Linux quite happily. They generally come
configured with a floppy drive and one or two internal hard disk
drives. They don't have an on-board frame-buffer though and one of
the three available SBus card slots must be sacrificed to add one.
Note: on the 1 and 1+ machines, the third SBus slot is marked as a
&ldquo;slave&rdquo; slot and is only suitable for frame-buffer boards. It
will not support I/O cards such as SCSI or Ethernet.</p><p><a href="2107t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>Two other models appearing on the second-user market more
frequently nowadays are the SPARCstation SLC and ELC systems. Both
of these machines are easily mistaken as being nothing more than
ordinary monochrome monitors, as the CPU is built into the housing
of a 17 inch grey scale monitor. The clues are the SCSI, RS232 and
keyboard connectors on the back panel of the machine. Keep an eye
open for these two, and you could pick up a bargain.</p><p>Although both models first saw the light of day after the
original SPARCstation 1, they were explicitly targeted at the
bottom end of the market and mostly ended up as diskless
workstations. The ELC is the more powerful of the pair, though not
by much, and it can be recognized by the CPU access panel at the
top rear of the monitor housing. However, as with the previously
mentioned machines, CPUs and chassis are interchangeable, so the
only way to tell for sure which machine you have is to power it
on.</p><p>Another two systems with a common chassis are the IPC and the
IPX. The enclosure for these two is smaller in width and depth and
a little taller than the &ldquo;pizza box&rdquo; machines, and it is designed
to have the same desktop &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; as the (separate) monitor.
This enclosure can be installed under the monitor or stood on edge
using an &ldquo;L&rdquo; shaped, blue-grey plastic stand supplied by Sun
along with the system.</p><p>The compact design of the enclosure emphasizes the fact that
these systems were targeted at the desktop user. The chassis is
limited to a single 3.5 inch hard drive bay (plus a floppy), and
non-standard mini-DIN style sockets are used for the RS232
connectors on the CPU back-panel.</p><p>Both machines have a built-in frame-buffer. The on-board
frame-buffer supplied with the IPC is only monochrome, although it
is possible to add colour by utilizing one of the two available
SBus slots. The IPX sports a colour frame-buffer and uses a
different type of SIMM, making it possible for the IPX to have a
greater overall memory capacity while actually having only one
third of the number of SIMM sockets of the IPC. Of the two, the IPX
is also the more powerful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1faa000"></a>Which To Choose?</h2></div></div><p>Of all of the &ldquo;4c&rdquo; architecture machines mentioned above,
probably the best choice of all is the SPARCstation 2. It offers
the versatility of three SBus slots and a two-disk chassis, and has
a much more powerful CPU than it's two look-alikes, the 1 and 1+.
One of the SBus slots is needed for a frame-buffer during the
install stage&mdash;Red Hat Linux/SPARC 4.0 needs a bit-addressable
console device for install. It can be removed later and one of the
RS232 ports used for the console connection instead, freeing up the
slot for another SCSI controller, for instance. The extra fan
between the floppy and hard disk mountings means that this model
runs the drives a little cooler. Although the IPX might be a more
suitable choice if you're looking for a colour desktop machine, the
SPARCstation2 is probably the ideal candidate for use as a
low-cost, high-capacity server.</p><p>The SPARCstation 1 and 1+ really are the elderly spinsters of
this older generation of machines. While both have mounting points
for two 3.5 inch SCSI disks, most of the drives available on the
market today require much greater cooling than this chassis can
provide. It's probably best to avoid these two systems unless you
plan to use only the Sun-installed internal drive and make all
additions and expansions on the external SCSI bus. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Do
NOT</em></span> install high speed, high capacity, hot running
drives such as the Seagate Barracuda into either of these machines.
The airflow around the drive bays is inadequate and you'll
seriously reduce the reliability and lifetime of the drive.</p><p>While the SLC and ELC appear, on face value, to be the least
attractive, they still have their good points. There's no cooling
fan (or disk) in either, so operation is quiet. Many people still
like monochrome systems for their crisp, steady displays,
especially when using the machine for extended hours for simple
tasks such as text processing. Both of these systems need an
external hard drive to run Red Hat Linux/SPARC. As already noted,
the ELC is the best choice of the two.</p><p>The IPC and IPX are more compact than the other models in the
Sun4c range and both have the advantage of a built-in frame-buffer.
However, with only one internal disk and two SBus slots, they are
probably best suited as desktop machines, rather than for server
applications. A few people on the SPARC Linux mailing list have
mentioned install difficulties with the IPC, but whether this is
simply because it is such a common system or due to a specific
system problem is an issue which remains unresolved at the time of
writing. The IPX is the best choice between these two anyway, as it
is the more powerful, has larger memory capacity and a colour
frame-buffer as standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1faa268"></a>Getting there... Red Hat's SPARC Linux
Release</h2></div></div><p>There are two basic options available for obtaining the Red
Hat Linux/SPARC distribution. For those of us without a direct
connection to the Internet, buying the Red Hat CD-ROM set is
probably the best choice, as the package includes a soft-cover
manual and technical support via e-mail or fax. This being Linux,
there are already some other CD-ROM collections available which
include the Red Hat distribution (but without the hard copy manual
or technical support options). On the other hand, if you have a
fast Internet connection, you might want to download the
distribution directly from the Red Hat ftp server or one of it's
many mirrors. Because the Red Hat installation program has an ftp
option, you can even limit your initial download to the install
image and use that option to download only the package groups you
specify during the interactive install process. The ftp option also
has an additional benefit. The folks at Red Hat usually make their
latest release available in the &ldquo;devel&rdquo; tree, so it's possible to
download the &ldquo;latest and greatest&rdquo; version using this
method.</p><p>No matter how you obtain the distribution, you must visit Red
Hat's web site and pick up the very latest version of the errata
file before you begin to install. This will save you some wasted
time and frayed nerves.</p><p>Despite the general excellence of SPARC Linux, several
problems with Red Hat's initial 4.0 release, which can spoil your
whole day if you don't know about them, came to light only after
the CD-ROM set was created. There are two files which you should
look at, the Linux/SPARC errata and the general errata for
whichever version you're loading. The latter covers problems common
to all architectures. Table 2 contains the URLs for the list of ftp
mirror sites carrying the release and for the errata.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1faa420"></a>Boot (And Booting Problems)</h2></div></div><p>There are several methods for booting into the Red Hat
installation program. Unfortunately, many of the worst bugs in the
initial release were directly related to the boot process, so 4.0
could be quite a struggle to install, especially for anyone not
familiar with the peculiarities of a SPARCstation to begin with.
While the 4.1 release addressed many of these problems, there are
still a few remaining bugs with the boot floppy images on the
CD-ROM, and you'd be much better off ftp-ing the latest images from
the Red Hat server.</p><p>Booting from the CD-ROM is the first and most obvious method.
Note that while the official Red Hat CD-ROM is bootable, copies of
the distribution on other vendors' &ldquo;compilation&rdquo; CD-ROM sets will
usually not be. The drawback with a boot from the 4.0 CD-ROM is a
bug preventing installation across multiple partitions, on the
target disk. If you boot from the 4.0 CD-ROM you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> install everything into one, large
partition. If you attempt to install across multiple partitions,
the install process fails shortly after creating the file systems
on your hard disk. I need to emphasize here that this problem is
restricted to booting from CD-ROM and 4.0 only. Any of the other
methods of installation outlined below will circumvent this
problem, as will booting from a 4.1 CD-ROM.</p><p>The command for booting from the CD-ROM is
<b  >bsd(0,6,0)</b> (from the <b  >&gt;</b>
prompt) for those machines with a boot PROM revision of less than
2, or <b  >boot cdrom</b> (from the <b  >ok</b>
prompt) for those machines with a boot PROM revision of 2 or
greater. The single partition problem can be overcome by net
booting your machine (see below) and then continuing with the
install from the local CD-ROM.</p><p>Creating boot and root floppies is the obvious method for
anyone who has downloaded the distribution across the Internet or
who must boot from CD-ROM. Creating the floppies is simply a case
of using <b  >dd</b> on a Linux or Unix system, or using
the supplied &ldquo;rawrite.exe&rdquo; program on a DOS machine. Booting from
the floppy is either <b  >bfd()</b> (PROM revision less
than 2), or <b  >boot floppy</b> (PROM revision 2 or
greater).</p><p>Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, the v0 floppy image from
both the 4.0 and 4.1 CD-ROMs has major problems, and the boot
process will almost always fail with messages which tend to make it
appear as though the media itself were faulty:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ok boot floppy
Booting from: fd(0,0,0)
SILO
Read error on block 1
Read error on block 8
Fatal error: Unable to open filesystem
boot:
</pre><p>The third method for booting, and the one I'd recommend, is a
network boot. This is your only option if your system has neither a
floppy nor local CD-ROM drive, and it is an elegant work around for
the problems besetting the CD-ROM and floppy installs. Assuming
that you have access to a network and at least one other Linux or
Unix system, this is by far the most reliable method. Note that
what we're talking about here is only booting across the network,
not setting up a diskless client. Creating a diskless client
requires a server with a fair sized chunk of free disk space, and
assumes that the server has the horsepower and network bandwidth to
support the client machine, whereas a boot server needs only enough
disk space to hold the install image file and serve it to the
client once at boot time. The client machine is not otherwise
dependent on the server, and once the install program is running on
the client it need never refer to the server again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1faa9f8"></a>Setting Up A Boot Server.</h2></div></div><p>The &ldquo;images&rdquo; directory on the CD-ROM and the ftp server
contain both the floppy files (boot-v0.img and boot-v2.img) and a
separate tftpboot.img file. As with the floppy images, the latest
tftboot.img file can downloaded from one of the Red Hat mirror
sites.</p><p>It is this latter file that is required for a network boot.
The method used to configure the boot server is almost identical
for Linux, SunOS and Solaris systems. We'll use an example
configuration, where our boot server is a machine called
<b  >tyne.gaijin.co.jp</b> and the SPARCstation client is
<b  >coquet.gaijin.co.jp</b>. The server IP address is
172.17.172.50.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Assign an IP address for your new machine on the
same sub-net as the boot server. In our example, the next available
IP address for the client &ldquo;coquet&rdquo; is 172.17.172.52. It's
hardware Ethernet address (MAC) is 8:0:20:3:9:96.</p></li><li><p>Create a directory for the tftp boot files on the
server. SunOS and Solaris machines use /tftpboot by default, and we
can use this directory on a Linux system, too.</p></li><li><p>Copy the tftpboot.img file to the newly created
directory.</p></li><li><p>Create a symbolic link from the tftpboot.img file
to a unique file name which the SPARCstation boot PROM requests
across the net. The format of the symbolic link is
&lt;CLIENT_HEX_IP_ADDRESS&gt;.&lt;ARCHITECTURE&gt;. Take the IP
address which you assigned in the first step and convert it,
section by section, to hex and then add the architecture of your
system. In our example, we need to convert 172.17.172.52 into hex
words and, since we aren't exactly sure what architecture our new
system is, we'll create links for both 4c and 4m machines.</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">

mode. The Linux tftp daemon does not use this option and, if it is
present in the config file, it treats it as a directory name and

into the installation program. The screen changes from the default
black-on-white to white-on-black with a much smaller font once the
kernel loads. You'll start to see the normal Linux boot messages as
devices are probed and identified. At the end of the boot sequence
the system drops straight into the install program, and from that
point onwards the prompts are pretty much self explanatory. There
are still a few things to watch out for, though.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1fa23b8"></a>Virtual Consoles</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat install makes virtual consoles available to the user

cylinder 0 to the last available cylinder. Root, swap and /usr
partitions are created in the normal way and overlap this &ldquo;whole

things which you need to know (see Red Hat's errata list for up to
date information). You really should update your kernel as soon as
possible to circumvent a particularly nasty networking bug which
plagued the 2.0.18 kernel shipped with this release. The problem
causes random hangs and crashes, especially when the machine is
attached to a network where IPX packets are also present. When
updating the kernel on your system, be sure to update the kernel
loadable modules, too. New kernel and module packages are available
in Red Hat's RPM package format on their FTP server, or
alternatively, you can get a binary &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the latest
kernel from vger.rutgers.edu (see Table 2).</p><p>Another problem which can be perplexing if you don't know
about it beforehand is the dump program. This slipped into the
distribution without having been checked for &ldquo;endian-ness&rdquo; and
consequently behaves very strangely indeed, complaining about seeks
to negatively numbered sectors and blocks. Again, an updated dump
package is available from the Red Hat site. Version 0.3-5 or
greater should work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb1580.0x1fa2a40"></a>Wrap-up</h2></div></div><p>As I write this, a group of folks are putting together the
first Debian release of SPARC Linux. However, Red Hat is the only
complete packaged release available on CD-ROM. While Red Hat's
initial, 4.0 release suffered from a few teething problems, it has
brought SPARC Linux into the mainstream Linux arena, rather than
being confined to a backwater as something of an oddity. The worst
of the problems have been fixed in 4.1, and this newer release also
comes at a much more attractive price. The availability of both
versions via FTP and on other vendors' compilation CD-ROMs is
adding to the popularity of this architecture, and the installed
base is spreading rapidly as evidenced by the increased traffic on
the SPARC Linux mailing list. While I.T. professionals may still be
reluctant to migrate the whole of their user base to SPARC Linux,
there certainly seem to be a growing number of organizations out
there who have one or two systems at least under evaluation. Many
more old SPARC workhorses are getting a new lease on life with
