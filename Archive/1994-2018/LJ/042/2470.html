    This month, Reuven shows us how to send and retrieve postcards
    on the
    Web using a relational database and CGI.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107d580.0x1175450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we began our exploration of
integrating relational databases into our CGI programs. CGI
programs often have to save and retrieve information. They
typically do this using text files on the server's file system. By
using a relational database, however, we can make our programs
flexible, powerful and robust, while at the same time reducing the
amount of code that we have to write.
</p><p>Like the Web, relational databases use the client-server
model, dividing the world into database clients (which make
requests) and servers (which respond to those requests). Requests
are typically written in SQL (Structured Query Language), which can
be embedded within programs.</p><p>This month, we look at a simple project that uses a
relational database to allow users to send electronic postcards to
each other. Next month, we will spend more time on this project,
improving on our original database design and making the program
even more useful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107d580.0x1175608"></a>Creating a Postcard System</h2></div></div><p>Over the last few years, &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; web sites have become
increasingly common. These sites, which often appear just before a
major event or holiday, allow people to send electronic postcards
to their friends and family.</p><p>One way to accomplish this task is to e-mail the postcard,
perhaps as a MIME attachment. This is relatively easy to do and
makes the system relatively simple. However, such a system requires
us to send the entire postcard, an operation which can use up a
great deal of bandwidth if our site gets a large number of
visitors.</p><p>In addition, many users still have to pay for their Internet
connection and might not wish to be sent an unsolicited 100
kilobyte mail message, even if it does contain a beautiful picture
and warm wishes. This can be a particular problem in the modern age
of spamming, when people send each other large quantities of mail
without regard for the fact that the recipient might end up having
to pay for telephone and networking charges.</p><p>Add to that the fact that not everyone uses a MIME-compliant
mail reader, and it becomes clear that at least for the time being,
sending large, sophisticated e-mail messages is not a good way to
make friends.</p><p>Thus, we will use a different approach. The postcards will be
housed in a database on our server and will be accessible via a CGI
program. When a postcard is created, a short e-mail message will be
sent to the recipient, indicating the URL from which she can
retrieve the postcard, using the web browser to display any
graphics.</p><p>We will write two CGI programs: one to create the postcard
and send the notification via e-mail, another to allow the
recipient to retrieve the postcard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107d580.0x11758c8"></a>Creating the Database</h2></div></div><p>Before we can write our programs, we need to create a table
in our relational database. For the purposes of demonstration, I'm
using MySQL 6.3, a SQL database that runs nicely on my Red Hat
Linux system. You can get more information about MySQL at
http://www.tcx.se/.</p><p>In order to create the database tables, we need to decide
what information we wish to store about each of the postcards. And
in order to do that, we need to know how we wish the postcards to
look.</p><p>Let's assume that the postcards are web pages constructed on
the fly by a visitor to our site. A specific postcard is created
when a CGI program receives a URL containing a unique identifier
following a question mark, known in Web lingo as the &ldquo;query
string&rdquo;. Thus, one postcard would be available via the URL
http://www.oursitename.com/cgi-bin/show-postcard.pl?12345, while
another postcard would be available via the URL
http://www.oursitename.com/cgi-bin/show-postcard.pl?67890.</p><p>The CGI program show-postcard.pl takes the value of the query
string (which, in the above examples, is either 12345 or 67890) and
uses it as an index in our database table. That table contains a
short message from the sender, as well as a picture of the sender's
choice.</p><p>In order to make this work, we need a table with seven
columns:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The postcard ID</p></li><li><p>The sender's name</p></li><li><p>The sender's e-mail address</p></li><li><p>The recipient's name</p></li><li><p>The recipient's e-mail address</p></li><li><p>The graphic of the postcard</p></li><li><p>The text of the postcard</p></li></ol></div><p>To avoid dealing with MySQL's security system, we put all of
our table information in the database named &ldquo;test&rdquo;. We can enter
the MySQL command-line interface by entering the following on the
command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql test
</pre><p>On typing that command on my system, I was greeted with the
following message:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Welcome to the mysql monitor. Commands ends with ; or \g.
Type 'help' for help.
mysql&gt;
</pre>


The <b  >mysql&gt;</b> prompt is MySQL's way of
signalling me that it is waiting for an SQL command.
</p><p>Just as in C and other programming languages with typed
variables, columns in an SQL table must have a data type associated
with them. The main data types we will use are
<b  >mediumint</b> (a medium-size integer),
<b  >varchar</b> (a string of variable length) and
<b  >blob</b> (an untyped storage element that accepts
large amounts of data).</p><p>First, we'll create a table with seven columns, one for each
of the pieces of data we wish to track, using the following SQL
query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table postcards (
        id_number mediumint not null primary key,
        sender_name varchar(60) not null,
        sender_email varchar(50) not null,
        recipient_name varchar(60) not null,
        recipient_email varchar(50) not null,
        graphic_name varchar(100) not null,
        postcard_text blob);
</pre><p>When I enter this at the MySQL prompt, I get the following
output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt;     create table postcards (
   -&gt;   id_number mediumint not null primary key,
   -&gt;   sender_name varchar(60) not null,
   -&gt;   sender_email varchar(50) not null,
   -&gt;   recipient_name varchar(60) not null,
   -&gt;   recipient_email varchar(50) not null,
   -&gt;   graphic_name varchar(100) not null,
   -&gt;   postcard_text blob);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
</pre>


Our database now contains a table named &ldquo;postcards&rdquo; with the
appropriate seven columns. Notice how each column, except for
postcard_text, is defined as being &ldquo;not null&rdquo;. This indicates
that the field must contain a value. By defining the table in this
way, the database server can enforce some conventions about how the
data is stored, thus avoiding potential problems.
</p><p>The first column, id_number, will be used to identify a
particular postcard. In order to ensure that only one postcard has
this particular ID number, we create the id_number column with the
keywords &ldquo;primary key&rdquo;, which is another way of saying that its
value must be unique across all rows. By making id_number a primary
key, we can retrieve postcards by asking for all rows with a
particular value of id_number&mdash;the result will be either a single
row (with a matching value of id_number) or no rows at all
(indicating that no postcard exists with that ID number).</p><p>The second through sixth columns are of type
<b  >varchar</b>, which simply means that their lengths
vary as necessary, up to the maximum number of characters indicated
in the parentheses. I chose these numbers somewhat arbitrarily; if
you suspect that e-mail addresses will always be fewer than 50
characters, then you might wish to shorten the appropriate fields.
By the same token, if you suspect that users might have names
longer than 60 characters, you should extend the lengths of these
fields.</p><p>The sixth column, graphic_name, contains the pathname of the
graphic to be inserted in the postcard.</p><p>The final column, defined as type &ldquo;blob&rdquo;, contains the text
that the sender wishes to send to the recipient. Because this
message is optional, we have indicated that this column can contain
a null value. MySQL allows us to enter a value in postcard_text,
but if we fail to provide such a value, the column will simply
contain a null value.</p><p>For a summary of our table, we can use the MySQL
<span   class="bold"><b>describe</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; describe postcards;
</pre><p>The output of this command is shown in Table 1.
</p><p><a href="2470s1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Output of describe
Command</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107d580.0x1176898"></a>Storing and Retrieving Postcards</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have created our &ldquo;postcards&rdquo; table, let's
insert some dummy data directly at the MySQL prompt. Then we will
write the program show-postcard.pl to display the dummy postcard.
Finally, we will write a program to allow users to enter postcards
via an HTML form.</p><p>We can insert data into a table by using the SQL
<span   class="bold"><b>insert</b></span> command. Let's say we wish
to insert a postcard with the following information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ID: 12345
Sender name: Reuven Lerner
Sender e-mail: reuven@netvision.net.il
Recipient name: Bill Clinton
Recipient e-mail: president@whitehouse.gov
Graphic: smile.gif
Text: Hey there, Mr. President!
</pre><p>To insert this information, use the following SQL command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
insert into postcards
  (id_number, sender_name, sender_email,
   recipient_name, recipient_email, graphic_name,
   postcard_text)
values
  (12345, "Reuven Lerner",
   "reuven@netvision.net.il",
   "Bill Clinton",
   "president@whitehouse.gov",
   "smile.gif",
   "Hey there, Mr. President!");
</pre>


Typing this command at the MySQL prompt produces this response:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.34 sec)
</pre>


In other words, one new row was successfully added to the table. To
retrieve it, use the SQL command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
select * from postcards where id_number = 12345;
</pre>


which produces the result shown in Table 2.
</p><p><a href="2470s2.html" target="_self">Table 2. New Database
Entry</a></p><p>While it might look ugly, this output actually makes sense.
The problem is that most CRTs are only 80 columns wide, while the
table is nearly twice that width. (And this magazine is even
narrower, making it even worse.) Luckily, when our program
retrieves a row, it does not have to worry about the
formatting.</p><p>If you are interested only in certain columns, you can
specify a subset of the entire row, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
select sender_name,graphic_name,postcard_text
 from postcards where id_number = 12345;
</pre><p>Submitting this query produces the result shown in Table 3.
The output row contains only the row corresponding to our postcard,
and the columns we have requested. As an added benefit, it is
easier to read than the entire row that we retrieved earlier.
</p><p><a href="2470s3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Output of select
Query</a></p><p>Now that we have seen the sort of SQL query that is necessary
to retrieve information from the database, it should be a snap to
write our CGI program. You can see an initial stab in
<a href="2470l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>This version of show-postcard.pl expects to be invoked with a
single argument (the postcard's ID number) in the query string, as
we mentioned earlier. If we go to the URL
/cgi-bin/show-postcard.pl?12345, we should see a postcard addressed
to Bill Clinton, with the message that we inserted by hand at the
MySQL prompt.</p><p>The program works in a relatively straightforward way. First,
it creates an instance of CGI, a Perl object (available from CPAN
at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/) that makes CGI programming easier.
After sending a MIME header indicating that the program will send
its output in HTML-formatted text, we retrieve the value of the
query string by using the <b  >param</b> method, as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $id = $query-&gt;param("keywords");
</pre><p>If the query string is empty, we print out an error message
and give the user another chance to enter a postcard ID number, by
using the little-known &lt;isindex&gt; tag. Note that we check the
numeric value of $id, by using the == operator, rather than simply
checking to see if $id is equal (with &ldquo;eq&rdquo;) to the null string.
This prevents problems if someone invokes show-postcard.pl with an
argument that includes characters other than numbers.
</p><p>Assuming that a number does arrive in the query string, we
connect to the test database, and then build up our SQL command in
the variable $command. We could, of course, simply insert the
command string inside of the call to $dbh-&gt;query. However,
building the command in a separate string makes it easier to
understand. It also has the added benefit of allowing us to debug
the program. We can print the literal query by uncommenting the
following debugging line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Uncomment for debugging
# print "&lt;P&gt;SQL command: \"$command\
        "&lt;/P&gt;\n";
</pre><p>When the above line is uncommented, we can see exactly what
is being passed to MySQL and find our program's problems more
easily.
</p><p>Our program then sends the request to MySQL using the
&ldquo;query&rdquo; method. The value returned is a handle into the database,
which can contain one or more rows matching our query. Since we are
requesting all rows matching a particular ID, we can be sure that
no more than one row is returned. This is true because we set
id_number to be a primary key, which makes it unique.</p><p>What happens if the user invokes show-postcard.pl with an ID
number that does not correspond to any postcard? If we were to
ignore this possible error, users entering nonexistent ID numbers
would see the outline of a postcard, but no actual content. This
isn't particularly friendly for our users, who would like to know
when they make a mistake and to be given a chance to correct it.
Thus, before we retrieve information from the returned row, we make
sure that there <span   class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> a returned row. If not,
then we can safely assume that this is because the ID number
submitted by the user did not match the id_number column for any
row in the database.</p><p>Our code accomplishes this checking by using the &ldquo;numrows&rdquo;
method on the statement handle ($sth)--the object which allows us
to read the results of our query. If numrows equals 0, we have not
received any rows from the server, and we complain to the user that
he has entered an ID number which does not match any on our
server.</p><p>Obviously, to be displayed, the graphic with the specified
name must exist in /tmp (or whichever directory you name in the
final part of the program) on the server. If the graphic's name is
misspelled or if it is placed in the wrong directory on the server,
the program will not be able to display it, so take care. (We will
take a closer look at this problem next month, when we look at the
use of multiple tables for the graphic.)</p><p>Finally, show-postcard.pl turns the row into a Web page that
can be sent to the user. Indeed, since the &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; is really a
Web page, you could argue that, while I have talked about this
project as if it were useful only for sending postcards, you could
easily adapt this strategy for creating personalized home pages on
your system, with each user getting a different page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107d580.0x156f698"></a>Creating the Postcard</h2></div></div><p>Now that we can retrieve postcards without too much trouble,
we have to take care of the final part of this project: allowing
users to create postcards using HTML forms.</p><p>The basic idea is as follows: The sender enters all of the
necessary information into an HTML form. The CGI program receiving
the submitted form saves the data to the &ldquo;postcards&rdquo; table, sends
e-mail to the recipient indicating how to retrieve the postcard,
and thanks the sender for using our service.</p><p>We have already seen how to insert data into the table using
an SQL query. All we have to do now is create a CGI program that
turns the contents of a form into such a query, and an HTML form
that submits its data to our program. You can see an example of
such a program, send-postcard.pl, in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="2470l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Program
send-postcard.pl</a></p><p>In many ways, send-postcard.pl does the same thing as
show-postcard.pl. It takes variable values from the HTML form and
inserts those values into a canned SQL query. That query is then
sent to the database server, which processes it&mdash;in this case, by
inserting a new row into the database.</p><p>As you can see from the listing, we first grab the contents
of each of the HTML form elements. In this particular version of
the program, we do not check the lengths of each of the fields. It
would undoubtedly be a good idea to do so in a production version,
given that the database has been instructed to accept names and
addresses with a certain maximum length.</p><p>Next, we create an ID number for the postcard:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $id_number = time &amp; 0xFFFFF &amp; $$;
</pre><p>Why didn't we take a simple value, such as time (the number
of seconds since January 1, 1970) or $$ (the current process ID)?
And why do we perform a bitwise &ldquo;and&rdquo; on these values? Because
the ID number must be unique; otherwise the database will not
accept the new row. We also want to avoid sequential numbers, so
that users will not be able to easily guess the numbers. This is
far from random and can be guessed by someone interested in doing
so; however, it is better than nothing at all and makes life a bit
more interesting.
</p><p>Finally, we create the entry for this postcard in the table,
building up the SQL command little by little:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $command = "";
$command = "insert into postcards ";
$command .= "  (id_number, sender_name,
        sender_email, recipient_name, ";
$command .= "   recipient_email, graphic_name,
        postcard_text) ";
$command .= "values ";
$command .= "  ($id_number, \"$sender_name\",
\"$sender_email\", ";
$command .= "   \"$recipient_name\", \"$recipient_email\", ";
$command .= "   \"$graphic_name\", \"$postcard_text\") ";
</pre><p>Notice how we have to surround all but one of the values with
quotation marks. This is because they are character values and
blobs (as opposed to integers), and thus must be quoted when passed
in an SQL query.
</p><p>Once the SQL query has returned, we know that the postcard
has been inserted into the database. Unless, of course, $sth is
undefined, in which case we die inelegantly with an error
message.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Make sure that $sth returned reasonably
die "Error with command \"$command\""
         unless (defined $sth);
</pre><p>Finally, we send e-mail to the recipient indicating that
there is a postcard waiting for her, along with the URL for
retrieving the postcard. So long as the ID number stored in the
database matches the value of $id_number in our program, we should
not have any problems. We finish up by thanking the sender for
using our system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x107d580.0x156fcc8"></a>Sending the Postcard</h2></div></div><p>Now we come to the part which will enable our users to send
postcards to each other: The HTML form from which the information
is submitted to the send-postcard.pl program.</p><p>This form, as you might expect, is relatively
straightforward. It contains five text fields, one for each of the
fields we expect to get from the user, as well as a text area into
which the user can enter arbitrary text. You can see the page of
HTML for yourself in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="2470l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. HTML Form for Submitting
Postcard</a></p><p>This system, while a bit crude, does demonstrate how to
create a postcard system on your web site with a bit of work. In
addition, by taking advantage of the power of SQL and the features
of a relational database, we created a relatively robust system
without a lot of work and without having to debug a lot of
code.</p><p>You could easily add another few HTML form elements to
postcard.html, making it possible for the sender of a postcard to
set the background color, text style and font of a particular
postcard. The possibilities are indeed limitless, although you
should avoid making such an HTML form look like the cockpit of a
jumbo jet.</p><p>There are, of course, a number of loose ends with this
project. One such problem has to do with the graphics, which we
mentioned briefly above. In addition, what happens if the ID number
is lost? Currently, there isn't any way for someone to come to our
site and retrieve any postcards that they might have sent or
received. We will take care of that next month, as we continue to
look at and use SQL in our CGI programs.</p></div></div>
