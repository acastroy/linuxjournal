    Noweb is a tool designed to enable a programmer to write documentation
    and code at the same time, with the goal of producing code that is easy
    to
    understand and maintain.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7c710"></a></h2></div></div><p>In essence, the purpose of literate
programming (LP) can be found in the following quote:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;Let us change our traditional attitude to the
construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task
is to instruct a <span   class="emphasis"><em>computer</em></span> what to do, let us
concentrate rather on explaining to <span   class="emphasis"><em>humans</em></span>
what we want the computer to do.&rdquo;&mdash;Donald E. Knuth, 1984.</p></blockquote></div>

</p><p>Such an environment reverses the notion of including
documentation, in the form of comments within the code, to one
where the code is embedded within a program's description. In doing
so, literate programming facilitates the development and
presentation of computer programs that more closely follow the
conceptual map from the problem space to the solution space. This,
in turn, leads to programs that are easier to debug and
maintain.</p><p>When writing literate programs, one specifies the program
description and the program code in a single source file, in the
order best suited to human understanding. The program code can be
extracted and assembled from this file into a form which the
compiler or interpreter can understand&mdash;a process called
&ldquo;tangling&rdquo;. Documentation is produced by &ldquo;weaving&rdquo; the
description and code into a form ready to be typeset (most often by
TeX or LATeX).</p><p>Many different tools have been created for literate
programming over the years. Most of the more popular are based,
either directly or conceptually, on the WEB system created by D. E.
Knuth (&ldquo;Literate Programming&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Computer
Journal</em></span> (27)2:97-111, 1984). This article focuses on
Norman Ramsey's <span   class="bold"><b>noweb</b></span>&mdash;a simple to
use, extensible literate programming tool that is independent of
the target programming language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7cb30"></a>Overview of the Noweb System</h2></div></div><p>When you write a literate program using noweb, you create a
simple text file (which by convention has a <b  >.nw</b>
extension) in which you provide all of the technical documentation
for the various parts of the program, along with the actual source
code for each part of the program.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2188f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Typeset Version of Perl Script
</p></div></div><p>This file ( <a href="2188l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> ),
which we call the nw source file, is then processed by
<span   class="bold"><b>noweave</b></span> to create the
documentation in a form ready for typesetting (the typeset version
of the program is shown in Figure 1), or by
<span   class="bold"><b>notangle</b></span> to extract the code
chunks and assemble them in their proper order for the compiler or
interpreter (the executable version of the program is in
<a href="2188l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> ). These two processes
are not stand-alone programs, but a set of filters through which
the nw source file is piped. It is this pipeline system that makes
noweb both flexible and extensible, since the pipelines can be
modified and new filters can be created and inserted in the
pipelines to change the behavior of noweb.</p><p>Like most literate programming tools, noweb depends on TeX or
LATeX&mdash;(LA)TeX to refer to either&mdash;for typesetting the
documentation (although it has options for producing HTML output as
well). However, one need not be a (LA)TeX guru to produce good
results. All of the hard work of cross-referencing, indexing and
typesetting the code is handled automatically by noweave.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7d058"></a>The Typeset Documentation</h2></div></div><p>The best way to get a feel for the capabilities of noweb is
by reference to the finished product: the typeset version of a
program. Figure 1 represents the typeset version of a Perl script
that actually extends noweb's functionality by providing a limited
&ldquo;autodefs&rdquo; filter. This filter will recognize and mark package
and subroutine names for automatic cross-referencing and
indexing.</p><p>When looking at this example, one can quickly see how chunks
of actual code are interspersed throughout the descriptive text.
Each code chunk is uniquely identified by page number and an
alphabetic sub-page reference. For example, in Figure 1, there are
four code chunks on the first page labeled in the left margin as
1a, 1b, 1c and 1d.</p><p>Besides the marginal tag, the first line of each code chunk
also has its name and a chunk reference enclosed in angle brackets
at the left margin and perhaps cross-reference information at the
right margin. Lets examine chunk 1b more closely&mdash;a reasonable
facsimile of its first line is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1b &lt;
</pre><p>This line tells us that we are now in chunk 1b. The
<b  >&lt;<i><tt>Global&nbsp;variables</tt></i>&nbsp;1a&gt;+=</b>
construct tells us we are working on the chunk named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Global variables</em></span> whose definition begins in
chunk 1a. The <b  >+=</b> indicates that we are adding to
the definition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Global variables</em></span>. At the
right margin we encounter <b  >(1d) &lt;1a 1c&gt;</b>,
which means that the chunk we are defining is used in chunk 1d, and
that the current chunk is continued from chunk 1a and will be
further continued in chunk 1c. It should be noted that all of these
visual cross-referencing clues&mdash;with the exception of the chunk
name itself&mdash;are provided automatically by noweb.
</p><p>At the end of any chunk there are two optional footnotes&mdash;a
&ldquo;Defines&rdquo; footnote and a &ldquo;Uses&rdquo; footnote. A user can manually
specify, in the nw source file, a list of identifiers (i.e.,
variables or subroutines) which are defined in the current chunk.
In addition, some identifiers may be automatically recognized, if
an &ldquo;autodefs&rdquo; filter for the programming language is used. There
are autodefs filters available for many languages including C,
Icon, TeX, yacc and Pascal).</p><p>These identifiers are listed in the &ldquo;Defines&rdquo; footnote
below the chunk where their definition occurs, along with a
reference to any chunks which use them. Any occurrence of a defined
identifier is referenced in a &ldquo;Uses&rdquo; footnote below the chunk
that uses that identifier.</p><p>For example, in Figure 1, we see that chunk 1c defines the
term <b  >$index_prefix</b> which is used in chunk 2b. A
quick peek at chunk 2b verifies that, indeed, this term is used and
appears in the &ldquo;Uses&rdquo; footnote for that chunk.</p><p>Chunk 1d, autodefs.perl, represents the top level description
of our entire program. This chunk is referred to as a &ldquo;root&rdquo;
chunk in noweb and is not used in any other chunk. Our example has
but one root chunk, although as many as you wish can be defined in
your nw source file, and notangle can extract each of them into
separate files.</p><p>The first line of code in chunk 1d is the obligatory
<b  >#!/usr/bin/perl</b> line which must begin all Perl
scripts intended to be invoked as an executable program. However,
the next two lines are not lines of Perl code at all but instead
are references to other named chunk definitions. The code from
those referenced chunks will be inserted at this point in the
executable program extracted by notangle. Thus, we have a broad
overview of our program, uncluttered by the specific global
variable initializations and subroutine definitions.</p><p>Looking at chunk 2a, which is included in our root chunk, we
see that it also includes another chunk, chunk 2b. This
demonstrates that the inclusion of chunks can be nested to
practically any level and can occur in any order in the
documentation (definitions need not precede uses).</p><p>Our documentation ends with two optional indices provided by
noweb&mdash;an index of code chunks and an index of identifiers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x1e7d7e8"></a>Writing the Program in Noweb</h2></div></div><p>With the knowledge of what comes out the end of the pipeline
in hand, we can now describe the structure of the nw source file
itself. The nw source file for our example program is given in
Listing 1.</p><p>When you write a noweb program, you alternate between
explaining some piece of code and providing the formal definition
of that piece of code. You must indicate whether you are entering
documentation or code by using one of two noweb tags.</p><p>To begin writing documentation, one starts with an @ symbol
in the left column, followed by either a space or a newline. This
indicates that all of the text that follows, at least up to the
next tag, is documentation text. All documentation text is passed
through the filtering process to the (LA)TeX file. Thus, the author
is responsible for providing any special formatting such as
sections, tables, footnotes and mathematical formulae which may be
desired or needed in the documentation.</p><p>In addition to the standard (LA)TeX command set, noweb
provides three additional control sequences. Any text surrounded by
double square brackets in the text is typeset in the same fashion
as literal code, and the <b  >\nowebindex</b> and
\nowebchunks commands expand into the two types of indices shown at
the end of our example in Figure 1.</p><p>To indicate the beginning of a code chunk, you use double
angle brackets surrounding a name for the code chunk followed by an
equal sign:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;&lt;code_chunk_name&gt;&gt;=
</pre><p>Everything following this construct is considered to be
literal code or a reference to another chunk name. You reference
another chunk name by placing its name in double angle brackets
with no trailing equal sign. As with documentation, a code chunk is
terminated when another tag is encountered. To continue a code
chunk definition, you start a new code chunk using the same name
within the brackets as the chunk to be continued.
</p><p>The special formatting and cross-referencing of code chunks
is handled automatically by noweb and requires no special input by
the user&mdash;with the one exception of manually specifying identifier
definitions.</p><p>To manually list identifiers which are defined in a given
chunk, you terminate that chunk with a line of the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@ %def
</pre><p>The identifiers given on the line will be placed in a
&ldquo;Defines&rdquo; footnote for that chunk and will automatically be
cross-referenced and indexed by noweb as described in the previous
section.
</p><p>The process by which notangle extracts the code into a form
suitable for the compiler or interpreter follows just a few simple
rules. A root chunk is specified on the command line as the chunk
to be extracted and assembled. This chunk is then printed line by
line until a reference to another chunk is encountered. At this
point, the referenced chunk is output line by line&mdash;and similarly
for any chunks referenced therein. When the referenced chunk has
been output, notangle continues the process of outputting the root
chunk.</p><p>When dealing with continued chunks&mdash;two or more chunks
sharing the same name&mdash;notangle concatenates their definitions in
order of appearance into a single, named chunk. The extracted code
for our example program is in Listing 2, and it can be seen that
all spacing and indentation is preserved appropriately in the
executable version.</p><p>Because of the way notangle extracts and assembles its input,
the program can be presented and explained in the best order for
human understanding. notangle will make sure that the program
chunks are in the right order for the compiler or
interpreter.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x2276010"></a>The Incantations</h2></div></div><p>Now that we know how to create a program in noweb, we can
examine the methods of generating our typeset and executable
versions of the program. The noweb distribution provides a general
shell script called, remarkably, noweb which drives the notangle
and <span   class="bold"><b>noweave</b></span> processes. However,
this method of invocation, though simple, is somewhat limited. We
will focus here on using each tool separately as this method
provides a more flexible approach.</p><p>When you invoke notangle, you specify a chunk name (a root
chunk) to extract and assemble from the nw source file. If you fail
to specify a chunk, notangle searches for a chunk named * to
extract (this is the default root chunk in a noweb program). The
notangle tool writes to stdout, so you must redirect this to a file
of your choice. The general form of the command is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
notangle [-R
        [-filter
</pre><p>Thus, to extract the executable version of our example
program we use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
notangle -Rautodefs.perl autodefs.perl.nw &gt;
         autodefs.perl
</pre>


The <b  >-R</b> option specifies which root chunk to
extract. The <b  >-L</b> option is used to embed line
directives, if they are supported by the compiler/interpreter you
are using. The line directives refer to locations in the nw source
file. Thus, when debugging your code, you never need to refer to
the executable version. Rather, you can edit the code in the nw
source file. The default format is for use with the C preprocessor,
but it also works well with Perl, with one catch. The line
directives are emitted whenever a chunk is entered or returned to,
and refer to the next line of code. Therefore, in a script such as
ours, a line directive winds up as the first line of the executable
version before the <b  >#!</b> line, rendering it
non-executable. The fix for this is to delete the first line
directive, or to move it below the first line and increment the
line number by one.
</p><p>One can write filters for use with either notangle or noweave
that manipulate the source once it is in the pipeline. The pipeline
representation of the nw source file in noweb is beyond the scope
of this article (see the &ldquo;Noweb Hacker's Guide&rdquo; included in the
documentation of the distribution). However, it should be noted
that a filter could easily be constructed which automates the
solution to the line directive problem.</p><p>The typeset version of the program is generated with the
noweave tool. There are several useful options for noweave, all
detailed in the man pages. We will only consider a few of the most
important options here.</p><p>The first option of general interest concerns the desired
output: you can specify <b  >-latex</b> (default),
<b  >-tex</b> or <b  >-html</b> as the
formatting language to be used for the final documentation. Each of
these options will supply an appropriate wrapper (which can be
suppressed with the <b  >-n</b> option) for the typeset
version. You can write your nw source file intended for LATeX
typesetting and still have the option of producing an HTML document
by invoking noweave with the <b  >-html</b> option and
the LATeX-to-html filter (<b  >-filter l2h</b>) included
with the distribution.</p><p>The <b  >-x</b> option enables cross-referencing
and indexing of chunk names, as well as any identifiers which are
automatically recognized by an &ldquo;autodefs&rdquo; filter. Using the
<b  >-index</b> option implies <b  >-x</b> and
provides cross-referencing and indexing for manually defined
identifiers&mdash;those mentioned in <b  >@&nbsp;%def</b>
statements in the nw source file.</p><p>Normally, noweave inserts additional information, such as the
filename for use in page headers, as part of its wrapper. The
<b  >-delay</b> option causes noweave to suspend the
insertion of this information until after the first documentation
chunk. This is most useful when you wish to provide your own
(LA)TeX wrapper to specify additional packages or to define your
own special formatting commands. This implies a
<b  >-n</b> (omission of wrapper) option and requires
that you make sure to include a <b  >\end{document}</b>
control sequence in a documentation chunk at the end of the file to
complete the wrapper. Our example nw source file is written in this
fashion.</p><p>Our typeset version (Figure 1) was produced by first
extracting the autodefs.perl root chunk with notangle and making it
executable using the <b  >chmod</b> system command. We
then placed this executable in the noweb library directory and
invoked noweave as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
noweave -autodefs perl -delay -index
        autodefs.perl.nw &gt; autodefs.tex
</pre><p>We can then run LATeX on the resulting file&mdash;twice, to
resolve page references&mdash;to create the dvi file, then use dvips to
create the postscript version for inclusion with this article.
</p><p>Additional options allow you to have the index created from
an external file, to expand tabs and to specify alternative
formatting options provided by the included noweb.sty file. The
latter includes options to omit chunk numbering in the left
margins, change text size in code chunks and switch from the
symbolic cross-referencing of code chunks occurring at the right
margin to simple footnote style cross-referencing similar in style
to the &ldquo;Defines&rdquo; and &ldquo;Uses&rdquo; footnotes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d84580.0x2276bc0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In general, a literate program takes more time and effort to
initially produce. However, since much of this initial effort is
devoted to explaining each part of the program, the author is
likely to produce a better quality program in the end, because she
has put more thought into the program's design at each stage of the
game. Additionally, by investing in the extra effort of creating a
well-documented program, the time spent later in maintaining and
upgrading the program is considerably lessened.</p><p>In terms of documentation and explanation, the ability to
describe components as they come into play in the design of the
program&mdash;rather than in the order they must occur for the compiler
or interpreter&mdash;is a vast improvement over traditional commented
code. In addition to the benefits of improved code and easier
maintenance, literate programs can also serve well as teaching
tools.</p><p><a href="2188s1.html" target="_self">Availability and
