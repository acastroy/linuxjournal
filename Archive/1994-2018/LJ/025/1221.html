of the two <a href="../024/1220.html" target="_self">previous</a> articles, we
now turn to all the nasty interrupt stuff. Astonishingly, Linux
hides most of this from us, so we do not need a single line of
assembler...
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2487580.0x257f978"></a>Reading and writing</h2></div></div><p>Right now, our magic <b  >skel</b>-machine driver
can load and even unload (painlessly, unlike in DOS), but it has
neither read nor written a single character. So we will start
fleshing out the <b  >skel_read()</b> and
<b  >skel_write()</b> functions introduced in the
previous article (under <span   class="bold"><b>fops and
filp</b></span>). Both functions take four arguments:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Static int skel_read (struct inode *inode,
                      struct file *file,
                      char *buf, int count)
Static int skel_write (struct inode *inode,
                       struct file *file,
                       const char *buf,
                       int count)
</pre><p>The <b  >inode</b> structure supplies the functions
with information used already during the
<b  >skel_open()</b> call. For example, we determined
from <b  >inode-&gt;i_rdev</b> which board the user wants
to open, and transferred this data&mdash;along with the board's base
address and interrupt to the <b  >private_data</b> entry
of the file descriptor. We might ignore this information now, but
if we did not use this hack, <b  >inode</b> is our only
chance to find out to which board we are talking.</p><p>The <b  >file</b> structure contains data that is
more valuable. You can explore all the elements in its definition
in <b  >&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</b>. If you use the
<b  >private_data</b> entry, you find it here, and you
should also make use of the <b  >f_flags</b>
entry&mdash;revealing to you, for instance, if the user wants blocking
or non-blocking mode. (We explain this topic in more detail later
on.)</p><p>The <b  >buf</b> argument tells us where to put the
bytes read (or where to find the bytes written) and
<b  >count</b> specifies how many bytes there are. But
you must remember that every process has its own private address
space. In kernel code, there is an address space common to all
processes. When system calls execute on behalf of a specific
process, they run in kernel address space, but are still able to
access the user space. Historically, this was done through
assembler code using the <b  >fs</b> register; current
Linux kernels hide the specific code within functions called
<b  >get_user_byte()</b> for reading a byte from user
address space, <b  >put_user_byte()</b> for writing one,
and so on. They were formerly known as
<b  >get_fs_byte</b>, and only
<b  >memcpy_tofs()</b> and
<b  >memcpy_fromfs()</b> reveal these old days even on a
DEC Alpha. If you want to explore, look in
<b  >&lt;asm/segment.h&gt;</b>.</p><p>Let us imagine ideal hardware that is always hungry to
receive data, reads and writes quickly, and is accessed through a
simple 8-bit data-port at the base address of our interface.
Although this example is unrealistic, if you are impatient you
might try the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Static int skel_read (struct inode *inode,
                      struct file *file,
                      char *buf, int count) {
    int n = count;
    char *port = PORT0 ((struct Skel_Hw*)
                        (file-&gt;private_data));
    while (n--) {
        <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wait till device is ready</em></span>
        put_user_byte (inb_p (port), buf);
        buf++;
    }
    return count;
}
</pre><p>Notice the <b  >inb_p()</b> function call, which is
the actual I/O read from the hardware. You might decide to use its
fast equivalent, <b  >inb()</b>, which omits a minimal
delay some slow hardware might need, but I prefer the safe
way.</p><p>The equivalent <b  >skel_write()</b> function is
nearly the same. Just replace the
<b  >put_user_byte()</b> line by the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        outb_p (get_user_byte (buf), port);
</pre><p>However, these lines have a lot of disadvantages. What using
them causes Linux to loop infinitely while waiting for a device
that never becomes ready? Our driver should dedicate the time in
the waiting loop to other processes, making use of all the
resources in our expensive CPU, and it should have an input and
output buffer for bytes arriving while we are not in
<b  >skel_read()</b> and corresponding
<b  >skel_write()</b> calls. It should also contain a
time-out test in case of errors, and it should support blocking and
non-blocking modes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2487580.0x25807e8"></a>Blocking and Non-Blocking Modes</h2></div></div><p>Imagine a process that reads 256 bytes at a time.
Unfortunately, our input buffer is empty when
<b  >skel_read()</b> is called. So what should it
do&mdash;return and say that there is no data yet, or wait until at
least <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> bytes have arrived?</p><p>The answer is <span   class="bold"><b>both</b></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blocking</em></span> mode means the user wants the driver
to wait till some bytes are read. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non-blocking</em></span>
mode means to return as soon as possible&mdash;just read all the bytes
that are available. Similar rules apply to writing:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blocking</em></span> mode means &ldquo;Don't return till you
can accept some data,&rdquo; while <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-blocking</em></span>
mode means: &ldquo;Return even if nothing is accepted.&rdquo; The
<b  >read()</b> and <b  >write()</b>calls
usually return the number of data bytes successfully read or
written. If, however, the device is non-blocking and no bytes can
be transferred, <b  >-EAGAIN</b> is typically returned
(meaning: <span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;Play it again, Sam&rdquo;</em></span>).
occasionally, old code may return <b  >-EWOULDBLOCK</b>,
which is the same as <b  >-EAGAIN</b> under Linux.</p><p>Maybe now you are smiling as happily as I did when I first
heard about these two modes. If these concepts are new for you, you
might find the following hints helpful. Every device is opened by
default in blocking mode, but you may choose non-blocking mode by
setting the <b  >O_NONBLOCK</b> flag in the
<b  >open()</b> call. You can even change the behaviour
of your files later on with the <b  >fcntl()</b> call.
The <b  >fcntl()</b> call is an easy one, and the man
page will be sufficient for any programmer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2487580.0x2577808"></a>Sleeping Beauty</h2></div></div><p>Once upon a time, a beautiful princess was sent by a witch
into a long, deep sleep, lasting for a hundred years. The world
nearly forgot her and her castle, twined about by roses, until one
day, a handsome prince came, kissed her, and awakened her --and all
the other nice things happened that you hear about in fairy
tales.</p><p>Our driver should do what the princess did while it is
waiting for data: sleep, leaving the world spinning around. Linux
provides a mechanism for that, called
<b  >interruptible_sleep_on()</b>. Every process reaching
this call will fall asleep and contribute its time slices to the
rest of the world. It will stay in this function till another
process calls <b  >wake_up_interruptible()</b>, and this
&ldquo;prince&rdquo; usually takes the form of an interrupt handler that has
successfully received or sent data, or Linux itself, if a time-out
condition has occurred.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2487580.0x2577a18"></a>Installing an Interrupt Handler</h2></div></div><p>The previous article in this series showed a minimal
interrupt handler, which was called
<b  >skel_trial_fn()</b>, but its workings were not
explained. Here, we introduce a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; interrupt handler,
which will handle both input to and output from the actual hardware
device. <a href="1221f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows a simple
version of its concept: When the driver is waiting for the device
to get ready (blocking), it goes to sleep by calling
<b  >interruptible_sleep_on()</b>. A valid interrupt ends
this sleep, restarting <b  >skel_write()</b>.</p><p><a href="1221f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> does not include
the double-nested loop structure we need when working with an
internal output buffer. The reason is that if we can perform only
writing within the <b  >skel_write()</b> function there
is no need for an internal output buffer. But our driver should
catch data even while not in <b  >skel_read()</b> and
should write the data in the background even when not in
<b  >skel_write()</b>. Therefore, we will change the
hardware writing in <b  >skel_write()</b> to write to an
output buffer and let the <span   class="emphasis"><em>interrupt handler</em></span>
perform the real writing to the hardware. The interrupt and
<b  >skel_write()</b> will now be linked by the
&ldquo;Sleeping Beauty&rdquo; mechanism and the output buffer.</p><p>The interrupt handler is installed and uninstalled during the
<b  >open()</b> and <b  >close()</b> calls to
the device, as suggested in the previous article. This task is
handled by the following kernel calls:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;linux/sched.h&gt;
int request_irq(unsigned int irq,
                void (*handler)
                     (int, struct pt_regs *),
                unsigned long flags,
                const char *device);
void free_irq(unsigned int irq);
</pre><p>The <b  >handler</b> argument is the actual
interrupt handler we wish to install. The role of the
<b  >flags</b> argument is to set a few features of the
handler, the most important being its behaviour as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fast</em></span> handler (<b  >SA_INTERRUPT</b>
is set in <b  >flags</b>) or as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>slow</em></span> handler ( <b  >SA_INTERRUPT</b>
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> set). A fast handler is run with all
interrupts disabled, while a slow one is executed with all
interrupts except itself enabled.</p><p>Finally, the <b  >device</b> argument is used to
identify the handler when looking at /proc/interrupts.</p><p>The handler function installed by
<b  >request_irq()</b> is passed only the interrupt
number and the (often useless) contents of the processor
registers.</p><p>Therefore, we'll first determine which board the calling
interrupt belongs to. If we can't find any boards, a situation
called a <span   class="emphasis"><em>spurious</em></span> interrupt has occurred, and
we should ignore it. Typically interrupts are used to tell whether
the device is ready either for reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span>
writing, so we have to find out by one or more hardware tests what
the device wants us to do.</p><p>Of course, we should leave our interrupt handler quickly.
Strangely enough, <b  >printk()</b> (and thus the
<b  >PDEBUG</b> line) is allowed even within fast
interrupt handlers. This is a very useful feature of the linux
implementation. If you look at kernel/printk.c you'll discover that
its implementation is based on wait queues, as the actual delivery
of messages to log files is handled by an external process (usually
klogd).</p><p>As shown in <a href="1221f2.html" target="_self">figure 2</a>, Linux
can handle a timeout when in
<b  >interruptible_sleep_on()</b>. For example, if you
have are using a device to which you send an answer, and it is
expected to reply within a limited time, causing a time-out to
signal an I/O error (<b  >-EIO</b>) in the return value
to the user process might be a good choice.</p><p>Certainly the user process could care for this, too, using
the alarm mechanism. But it is definitely easier to handle this in
the driver itself. The timeout criteria is specified by
<b  >SKEL_TIMEOUT</b>, which is counted in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>jiffies</em></span>. Jiffies are the steady heartbeat of a
Linux system, a steady timer incremented every few milliseconds.
The frequency, or number of jiffies per second, is defined by
<b  >HZ</b> in <b  >&lt;asm/param.h&gt;</b>
(included in <b  >&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</b>) and varies
on different architectures (100 Hz Intel, 1 kHz Alpha). You simply
have to set</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define SKEL_TIMEOUT <span   class="emphasis"><em>timeout_seconds</em></span> * HZ
/* ... */
current-&gt;timeout = jiffies + SKEL_TIMEOUT
</pre><p>and if <b  >interruptible_sleep_on</b> timed out,
<b  >current-&gt;timeout</b> will be cleared after
return.</p><p>Be aware that interrupts might happen within
<b  >skel_read()</b> and <b  >skel_write()</b>.
Variables that might be changed within the interrupt should be
declared as <b  >volatile</b>. They also need to be
protected to avoid race conditions. The classic code sequence to
protect a critical region is the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
unsigned long flags;
save_flags (flags);
cli ();
<span   class="emphasis"><em>critical region</em></span>
restore_flags (flags);
</pre><p>Finally, the code for the &ldquo;complete&rdquo; error handler:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

<b  >select()</b>, one of the most interesting parts of
Unix, in our opinion.</p><p>The <b  >select()</b> call is used to wait for a
device to become ready, and is one of the most scary functions for
the novice C programmer. While its use from within an application
is not shown here, the driver-specific part of the system call is
shown, and its most impressive feature is its compactness.</p><p>Here's the full code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Static int skel_select(struct inode *inode,
                       struct file *file,
                       int sel_type,
                       select_table *wait) {
    Skel_Clientdata *data=filp-&gt;private_data;
    Skel_Board *board=data-&gt;board;
    if (sel_type==SEL_IN) {
        if (! SKEL_IBUF_EMPTY (board))
            /* readable */
            return 1;
        <span   class="emphasis"><em>skel_tell_hw_we_ask_for_data</em></span>;
        select_wait(&amp;(hwp-&gt;skel_wait_iq), wait);
        /* not readable */
        return 0;
    }
    if (sel_type==SEL_OUT) {
        if (! SKEL_OBUF_FULL (board))
            return 1;  /* writable */
        /* hw knows */
        select_wait (&amp;(hwp-&gt;skel_wait_oq), wait);
        return 0;
    }
    /* exception condition: cannot happen */
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>As you can see, the kernel takes care of the hassle of
managing wait queues, and you have only to check for
readiness.</p><p>When we first wrote a <b  >select()</b> call for a
driver, we didn't understand the <b  >wait_queue</b>
implementation, and you don't need to either. You only have to know
that the code works. <b  >wait_queue</b>s
<span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> challenging, and usually when you write a
driver you have no time to accept the challenge.</p><p>Actually, <b  >select</b> is better understood in
its relationships with read and write: if
<b  >select()</b> says that the file is readable, the
next read must not block (independently of
<b  >O_NONBLOCK</b>), and this means you have to tell the
hardware to return data. The interrupt will collect data, and
awaken the queue. If the user is selecting for writing, the
situation is similar: the driver must tell if
<b  >write()</b> will block or not. If the buffer is full
it will block, but you don't need to tell the hardware about it,
since <b  >write()</b> has already told it (when it
filled the buffer). If the buffer is not full, the write won't
block, so you return 1.</p><p>This way to think of selecting for write may appear strange,
as there are times when you need to write synchronously, and you
may expect that a device is writable when it has already accepted
pending input. Unfortunately, this way of doing things will break
the blocking/nonblocking machinery, and thus an extra call is
provided: if you need to write synchronously, the driver must offer
(within its <b  >fops</b>) the
<b  >fsync()</b>call. The application invokes
<b  >fops-&gt;fsync</b> through the
<b  >fsync()</b> system call, and if the driver doesn't
support it, <b  >-EINVAL</b> is returned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2487580.0x288e110"></a><b  >ioctl()</b>--Passing Control
Information</h2></div></div><p>Imagine that you want to change the baud-rate of a serial
multiport card you have built. Or tell your frame grabber to change
the resolution of an image. Or whatever else... You could wrap
these instructions into a series of escape sequences, such as, for
example, the screen positioning in ANSI emulation. But, the normal
method for this is to make an <b  >ioctl()</b>
call.</p><p><b  >ioctl()</b> calls as defined in
<b  >&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</b> have the form</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ioctl (int <span   class="emphasis"><em>file_handle</em></span>, int <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span>, ...)
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>...</em></span> is considered to be one
argument of the type <b  >char *</b> (according to the
<b  >ioctl</b> man page). Strange as it may be, the
kernel receives these arguments in <b  >fs/ioctl.c</b> in
the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int sys_ioctl (unsigned int fd, unsigned int cmd,
               unsigned long arg);
</pre><p>To add to the confusion,
<b  >&lt;linux/ioctl.h&gt;</b> gives detailed rules how
the commands in the second parameter should be built, but nobody in
all the drivers is actually following these ideas yet.</p><p>In any case, rather than cleaning up the Linux source tree,
let's concentrate on the general <span   class="emphasis"><em>idea</em></span> of
<b  >ioctl()</b> calls. As the user, you pass the file
handle and a command in the first two arguments and pass as the
third parameter a pointer to a data structure the driver should
read and/or write.</p><p>A few commands are interpreted by the kernel itself&mdash;for
example, <b  >FIONBIO</b>, which changes the
blocking/non-blocking flag of the file. The rest is passed to our
own, driver-specific <b  >ioctl()</b> call, and arrives
in the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int skel_ioctl (struct inode *inode,
                struct file *file,
                unsigned int cmd,
                unsigned long arg)
</pre><p>Before we show a small example of a
<b  >skel_ioctl()</b> implementation, the commands you
define should obey the following rules:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Pick up a free MAGIC number from
/usr/src/linux/MAGIC and make this number the upper eight bits of
the 16-bit command word.</p></li><li><p>Enumerate commands in the lower eight bits.</p></li></ol></div><p>Why this? Imagine &ldquo;Silly Billy&rdquo; starts his favorite
terminal program minicom to connect to his mailbox. &ldquo;Silly Billy&rdquo;
accidentally changed the serial line minicom uses from /dev/ttyS0
to /dev/skel0 (he is quite silly). The next thing minicom does is
initialize the &ldquo;serial line&rdquo; with an <b  >ioctl()</b>
using <b  >TCGETA</b> as command. Unfortunately, your
device driver, hidden behind /dev/skel0, uses that number to
control the voltage for a long-term experiment in the lab...</p><p>If the upper eight bits in the commands for
<b  >ioctl()</b> differ from driver to driver, every
<b  >ioctl()</b> to an inappropriate device will result
in an <b  >-EINVAL</b> return, protecting us from
extremely unexpected results.</p><p>Now, to finish this section, we will implement an
<b  >ioctl()</b> call reading or changing the timeout
delay in our driver. If you want to use it, you have to introduce a
new variable</p><pre     class="programlisting">
unsigned long skel_timeout = SKEL_TIMEOUT;
</pre><p>right after the definition of <b  >SKEL_TIMEOUT</b>
and replace every later occurrence of
<b  >SKEL_TIMEOUT</b> with
<b  >skel_timeout</b>.</p><p>We choose the <b  >MAGIC</b> <b  >'4'</b>
(the ASCII character 4) and define two commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# define SKEL_GET_TIMEOUT 0x3401
# define SKEL_SET_TIMEOUT 0x3402
</pre><p>In our user process, these lines will double the time-out
value:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* ... */
unsigned long timeout;
if (ioctl (skel_hd, SKEL_GET_TIMEOUT,
           &amp;timeout) &lt; 0) {
    /* an error occurred (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Silly billy?</em></span>) */
    /* ... */
}
timeout *= 2;
if (ioctl (skel_hd, SKEL_SET_TIMEOUT,
           &amp;timeout) &lt; 0) {
    /* another error */
    /* ... */
}
</pre><p>And in our driver, these lines will do the work:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int skel_ioctl (struct inode *inode,
                struct file *file,
                unsigned int cmd,
                unsigned long arg) {
    switch (cmd) {
    case SKEL_GET_TIMEOUT:
        put_user_long(skel_timeout, (long*) arg);
        return 0;
    case SKEL_SET_TIMEOUT:
        skel_timeout = get_user_long((long*) arg);
        return 0;
    default:
        return -EINVAL; /* for Silly Billy */
    }
