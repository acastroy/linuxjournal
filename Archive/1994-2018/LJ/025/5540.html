    Many people who love the GNU gcc compiler still think
    that it is too slow in normal use, or that it uses too much
    memory.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b660"></a></h2></div></div><p>lcc is a small, fast C compiler now
available on Linux. A perfectly good C compiler, gcc, comes with
Linux. Why would anyone bother installing a second one? Because the
two compilers make different tradeoffs, so they suit different
stages of the development cycle. gcc has many targets and users,
and it includes an ambitious optimizer. lcc is 75% smaller (more
when counting source code), compiles more quickly, and helps
prevent some porting bugs.
</p><p>For those who have always wanted to customize or extend their
compiler, our recent book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation</em></span>, tours lcc's source code in
detail and thus offers especially thorough documentation. Pointers
to lcc's source code, executables, book, and authors appear at the
end of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b818"></a>Speed Tradeoffs</h2></div></div><p>lcc is fast. gcc implements a more ambitious global code
optimizer, so it emits better code, particularly with full
optimization options, but global optimization takes time and space.
lcc implements a few low-cost, high-yield optimizations that
collaborate to yield respectable code in a hurry.</p><p>For example, lcc compiles itself in 36 seconds on a 90
megahertz Pentium running Linux. gcc takes 68 seconds to compile
the same program (the lcc source) with the default compiler
options, and 130 seconds with the highest level of optimization.
Code quality varied less. gcc's default code took 36 seconds to
reprocess this input, just like lcc's code. gcc's best code (that
is, with optimization level 3) runs in 30 seconds, about 20%
faster. This is only a single data point, and both compilers evolve
constantly, so your mileage may vary. Naturally, one can save time
by using lcc for development and optimizing with gcc for the final
release build.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249b978"></a>Porting Code</h2></div></div><p>Indeed, compiling code with two different compilers helps
expose portability bugs. If a program is useful and if the source
code is available, sooner or later someone will try to port it to
another machine, or compile it with another compiler, or both. With
a new machine or compiler, glitches are not uncommon. Which of the
following solutions will net you less unwanted e-mail? For you to
find and erase these blots while the code is fresh in your mind? Or
for the porter to get diagnostics much later, about non-standard
source code?</p><p>lcc follows the ANSI standard faithfully and implements no
extension. Indeed, one option directs lcc to warn about a variety
of C constructs that are valid but give undefined results, and thus
can behave differently on a different machine or with a different
compiler. Some programmers use lcc mainly for its strict-ANSI
option, which helps them keep their code portable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249bad8"></a>Cross Compiling</h2></div></div><p>Like gcc, lcc can be configured as a cross-compiler that runs
on one machine and compiles code for another. Cross-compilers can
simplify life for programmers with multiple target platforms. lcc
takes this notion a step further than most cross-compilers: we can,
and typically do, link code generators for several machines into
each version of the compiler.</p><p>For example, we maintain code generators for the MIPS, SPARC,
and X86 architectures. We both work on and generate code for
multiple platforms, so it's handy to be able to generate code for
any target from any machine. We usually fold all three code
generators into all compiler executables. A run-time option tells
lcc which target to generate code for. If you don't maintain code
for multiple targets, you're free to use an lcc that includes just
one code generator, saving roughly 50KB for each code generator
omitted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249bc38"></a>A Compact Compiler</h2></div></div><p>lcc is small. lcc's Linux executable with one code generator
is 232 KB, and its text segment is 192 KB. Both figures for the
corresponding phase of gcc (cc1) exceed a megabyte. lcc's small
size contributes to its speed, especially on modest systems. A
compact program benefits those who wish to modify the compiler.
Most developers will use pre-built executables for lcc; they will
never examine or even recompile the source code. But the Linux
community particularly prizes the availability of source code,
partly because it allows users to customize their programs or adapt
them for other purposes.</p><p>When configured with the Linux PC code generator lcc is
12,000 lines of C source code. gcc's root directory&mdash;without the
target-specific description files&mdash;holds 240,000 lines. Surely,
some of this material is not part of the compiler proper, but the
separation is not immediately apparent to those who haven't browsed
gcc's source recently. The machine-specific module is the part most
often changed, because new target machines come along more often
than, say, new source languages. The lcc target-specific module for
the Linux PC is 1200 lines, and half of that repeats boilerplate
declarations or supports the debugger, so the actual code generator
is under 600 lines. The target-specific modules for gcc average
about 3000 lines. These comparisons illustrate the fact that the
two compilers embody different trade-offs and that neither beats
the other at everything: gcc can emit better code and offers many
options, while lcc is easier to comprehend but is otherwise less
ambitious.</p><p>gcc and lcc use retargetable code generators driven in part
by formal specifications of the target machine, just as a parser
can be driven by a formal grammar of its input language. gcc's code
generator is based in part on techniques that one of us (Fraser)
originated in the late 1970's. lcc uses a different technique that
is simpler but somewhat less flexible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249bdf0"></a>An Adaptable Tool</h2></div></div><p>Its compact source code helps people adapt lcc. An early
adaptation by one of us (Hanson) injected profiling code that
counts executions for a profiler that comes with lcc. For example,
the lines</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<b  >for (&lt;1965&gt;r = 0; &lt;15720&gt;r &lt; 8; &lt;15720&gt;r++)
   if (&lt;15720&gt;rows[r] &amp;&amp;
       &lt;5508&gt;up[r-c+7] &amp;&amp;
       &lt;3420&gt;down[r+c]) { ...
</b>
</pre><p>annotate source code from the lcc test suite's implementation
of a program that finds all ways to place eight queens on a
chessboard such that none of them attacks any other. The numbers in
angle brackets report how many times the following code fragment
was executed, which can differ within one line. This profiler would
have been a big project without lcc, but it was modest one with it.
Other adaptations of lcc include interpreters
(<a href="http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~sosic/papers/sigplan92.ps.Z" target="_self">www.cit.gu.edu.au/~sosic/papers/sigplan92.ps.Z</a>),
code generators for multiple targets
(ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/lcc/contrib/), a C++ compiler,
programmable debuggers that can debug across a network
(<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/nr/ldb" target="_self">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/nr/ldb/</a>),
and a retargetable optimizing linker
(<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mff/mld" target="_self">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mff/mld/</a>).
A group at Stanford University has adapted lcc for use with a
global optimizer
(<a href="http://suif.stanford.edu/suif/suif.html" target="_self">suif.stanford.edu/suif/suif.html</a>).
At least some of these efforts chose lcc over gcc because lcc's
small size made it seem easier to comprehend and change. Many of
these projects were begun before the lcc book was done; we expect
even more adaptations now that extensive documentation is
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249c160"></a>Literate Programming</h2></div></div><p>Most developers will use pre-built executables for lcc and
never study the source code. The Linux community, however, expects
source, and lcc provides an annotated version of most of its code
in the form of a book. lcc's annotations, like its small size, are
designed to help developers modify lcc.</p><p>lcc is written as what Knuth has termed a &ldquo;literate
program&rdquo;, which interleaves the source code with prose
explanations. Two programs process this input. One program extracts
just the C source code, which can be compiled with any C compiler.
The other program processes both the prose and the code and emits
the typescript for the lcc book. We generate the book and the
compiler from a single source because it's too easy for multiple
sources to get out of sync with one another.</p><p>A brief fragment of the chapter on the X86 code generator
demonstrates literate programming:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Static locals get a generated name to avoid other
static locals of the same name:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;X86 defsymbol&gt;=
if (p-&gt;scope &gt; LOCAL &amp;&amp; p-&gt;sclass == STATIC)
   p-&gt;x.name = stringf("L%d", genlabel(1));
</pre><p>Generated symbols already have a unique numeric name. Defsymbol
simply prefixes a letter to make a valid assembler identifier:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;X86 defsymbol&gt;+=
else if (p-&gt;generated)
   p-&gt;x.name = stringf("L%s",p-&gt;name);
</pre></blockquote></div><p>Each of the two displays above consists of a &ldquo;fragment
label&rdquo; in angle brackets and a &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; of C code. The
fragment label names the piece of the C program being described
(here the version of the routine defsymbol for the X86). The
<b  >+=</b> in the second fragment says that the second
code fragment is appended to the first.</p><p>This example is necessarily tiny, but it shows how literate
programming allows one to build up a complex program a bit at a
time, explaining it on the way. The lcc distribution includes
conventional C code that can be modified as usual, but when some
explanation would help, one can easily get it from the annotated
code in the book.</p><p>Not shown in this sample are page numbers in each fragment
that point to adjoining fragments, and miniature indices in the
page margin that point to the page that defines each identifier
that's being used. Many readers have identified these mini-indices
as especially helpful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23a3580.0x249c630"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>lcc's C source code and Linux executables are available for
anonymous ftp at URL ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/lcc/. It's
about a megabyte, so it can be downloaded using even, say, a
14.4kbaud modem in about 10 minutes. The package includes Dennis
Ritchie's preprocessor for ANSI C, but lcc is also used with gcc's
preprocessor. Like gcc, lcc emits assembler code for the standard
Linux assembler, debugger, and C library, so the package does not
include any of these. A sub-directory collects code generators and
other companion software contributed by others. The package
describes mailing lists for communicating with others working on,
and with, lcc.</p><p>Our book about lcc, <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation</em></span>, (ISBN 0-8053-1670-1) is
available from Addison Wesley at 800-447-2226 and from other
sources listed on lcc's home page
(<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc" target="_self">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/</a>).</p><p>lcc is free for non-commercial use. The lcc book amounts to a
single-user license for lcc, so some have arranged commercial use
by simply including a copy of the book with their product (and
charging for it); the publisher offers substantial discounts. Other
arrangements are possible.</p></div></div>
