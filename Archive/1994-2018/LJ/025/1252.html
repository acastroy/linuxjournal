magazine grow and mature much like Linux itself. Keep up the good
work.</p><p>On to the suggestion&mdash;I was wondering if you plan to run an
article on the Linux SPARC port with news and views from the
developers. With a number of elderly SPARCs hanging around I'm
looking forward to the possibility of running Linux on them.</p><p>&mdash;Neil Clifford <a href="mailto:n.clifford@physics.oxford.ac.uk">n.clifford@physics.oxford.ac.uk</a>
<a href="http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/sat/vsohp/satintro.html" target="_self">www.physics.ox.ac.uk/sat/vsohp/satintro.html</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a6580.0x199e3a0"></a>Yes!</h2></div></div><p>Progress on that front has been amazingly rapid lately, and
we expect to run an article on the topic some time in the near
future. While development continues, Linux/SPARC currently runs
both native binaries and SunOS 4 binaries, including X-based ones.
For example, the SunOS Netscape runs under Linux/SPARC. It can
netboot with the recent NFS root support in Linux. Debian/SPARC and
Red Hat/SPARC are both underway.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a6580.0x199e4a8"></a>Missing Pieces?</h2></div></div><p>I recently purchased the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Unleashed</em></span> and transferred the files on the CD-ROM to a
SyQuest 270 MB cartridge. Linux (Slackware version 1.2.1) is now
booting and running fine on my computer.</p><p>Since 1982, I've done hundreds of Xenix and Unix
installations. The only drawbacks I see to Linux are as
follows:</p><p>1. The termcap file is extremely sparse, not even including
the setup for a Wyse-60 terminal!</p><p>2. The printcap file is also extremely sparse, not supporting
either HPGL or PostScript or Epson dot matrix printers!</p><p>3. SCO binaries cannot be run!</p><p>My question to you is: Is there a newer version of Linux I
could download or purchase that rectifies each of these problems?
Unfortunately, I don't have the time to experiment or develop my
own version; I need one already prepared that can run SCO binaries
and has a comprehensive termcap and printcap.</p><p>Thanks for your help.  &mdash;Ronald W SatzSystems Engineer</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a6580.0x199e818"></a>Old software</h2></div></div><p>The version you have purchased is very old; Slackware has
gone through two major revisions since. Most Linux distributions
now include the standard BSD termcap and terminfo files, which do
include support for the Wyse-60. Printing support under Linux is
much richer than your question suggests. There is a document called
the <span   class="bold"><b>Printing HOWTO</b></span> available as
part of the <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Documentation
Project</b></span>. Newer distributions include the LDP documents
in electronic form, and several vendors sell the documents in
printed form, as well. Finally, support for SCO binaries (through
the &ldquo;iBCS2&rdquo; package) is now a part of every major Linux
distribution. While it doesn't run <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> SCO
binary, it does run the great majority. One caution: support for
SCO OpenServer 5 has been added in only development versions of the
iBCS2 package, and that support won't be added to distributions for
a few months.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18a6580.0x199ea28"></a>BogoMips on Pentia</h2></div></div><p>In his &ldquo;The Quintessential Linux Benchmark&rdquo; Wim van Dorst
writes: &ldquo;The table also shows that the Pentium processor doesn't
have the expected extrapolated multiplication factor. This is due
to the fact that the specific busy-loop algorithm is not optimized
for the parallelism of the Pentium processor.&rdquo;</p><p>But won't every everybody ask, &ldquo;What if it were optimized?&rdquo;
and &ldquo;How would it be optimized?&rdquo;</p><p>I have the answer: the optimization for the Pentium is to put
the decrement and branch instructions apart by inserting a nop
instruction between them. This allows the branch to be predicted
correctly, and the BogoMips number becomes clock * 1.00 +/- 0.003
(based on two measurements on Pentium 75 and 90).</p><p>One of the reasons it is not done in the distribution code is
the idea to have one code per architecture (instruction set), and
another reason is quite obvious as well&mdash;the loop code is only used
for timing, and the slower each loop iteration, the less the energy
consumption by the processor. You don't want to fry eggs on your
chip while measuring BogoMips, do you?</p><p>--Leonid A.
