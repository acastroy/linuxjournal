    If you have ever considered starting your own Internet
    Services Provider business with Linux, Todd gives you both
    an introduction to the subject and a quiz to help you decide
    if you really want to start.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b65b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ever since the opening of the Internet to
commercial development a few years ago, many an individual has made
a living for himself by leasing a connection to the global network,
establishing a local network, and tacking up his siihingle as an
Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISPs, from the mighty MCI down to
the most humble Mom and Pop basement organizations, offer exactly
the same thing&mdash;a direct connection to the Internet. Smaller
businesses do this mostly via PPP connections over modems, whereas
larger ISPs tend to stick to leased-line dedicated connections.
</p><p>Although this might sound daunting at first, the actual
process is not impossible, even for a single individual of limited
resources. The most pressing obstacle in the past has been that the
resources needed to offer ISP-like services&mdash;not merely PPP
connections but also e-mail, Usenet, and FTP/WWW hosting&mdash;have only
been available in the form of high-end (and high-cost) Unix
workstations. This translated into considerable cost for the
budding entrepreneur.</p><p>The other traditional problem has been that the system- and
network-administration skills needed to offer such services could
only be gained on one of these high-priced workstations, creating a
chicken-or-the-egg dilemma, whereby if you did not already have
access to these machines through work or school, your main capital
investment would have to sit idle for six months to a year while
you tried to learn how to run it.</p><p>The ubiquitous nature of Intel-x86-based personal computers,
the strength of their networking capabilities and, most of all,
free operating systems such as Linux brought this sad state of
affairs to an end. With its traditions of laissez-faire development
and absolutely free access, Linux offers two qualities essential to
the upstart ISP. The first of these is minimal cost. The second,
and the more important, is the ability to learn
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the essentials of network administration
on an operating system which refuses to withhold any secrets from
you.</p><p>It is hard to reinforce this latter aspect of Linux enough.
As an independent Internet Service Provider, your job is network
management. If your machines are not routing traffic properly,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> must understand why and be able to fix it.
If your Usenet feed is clogging your system,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> must be able to diagnose the problem and
fix it. If your DNS is not spitting out IP numbers properly, it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> problem, and yours alone. Microsoft
technical support will not come down and help you figure out why.
Sprint or MCI will not drop what they are doing to help you out,
even if you are their customer. Good consultants (other than the
author) are notoriously hard to find and (including the author) are
horribly expensive.</p><p>Linux is <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> operating system of choice
for ISPs, because it fulfills the number one requirement for an
ISP's OS. You must be able to diagnose problems, and you must know
enough about your system's operation to be able to fix the problems
which <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> plague you, no matter what OS you
choose. This, combined with the huge range of software available
for Linux, make it the hands-down winner.</p><p>This is not to say that Linux is perfect, and indeed, there
are several problems with Linux in an ISP environment. This article
should help by offering a roadmap, showing both obstacles and
bypasses to help you in your journey. It does not offer advice on
how to connect to the Internet, but rather concentrates on using
Linux to offer ISP services.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b6ad8"></a>Getting Started: Hard(ware) Choices</h2></div></div><p>Your first step is deciding on a hardware base. What kind of
machines will you run? How many of them will you have? What
peripheral equipment will you need? You should have good answers to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of these questions before you buy any
hardware.</p><p>In the past, the platform decision was easy. If you ran
Linux, you used an Intel-based or Intel-clone 386 or greater
machine. With the recent enhancements to Linux for the Sparc, MIPS,
and DEC Alpha, this choice is a little more clouded. Red Hat and
others are coming out with full-fledged CD-ROM distributions for
these higher-powered machines. While these are in the early stages
of development and I do not recommend them (yet), the
price-to-performance edge of these machines, especially the DEC
Alpha, means you should keep them in mind as a real option,
especially for upgrading your system down the road. For startups,
though, x86 machines are usually the way to go.</p><p>If you are going to concentrate on dial-up business, you will
need modems. Modems can be one of your worst nightmares, and you
should shop carefully. However, the modem issue is not
Linux-specific. With V.34 finally having settled down to a
well-established standard, most modems will do the job, and many
people suggest shopping for price. Nonetheless, doing your homework
by reading reviews and soliciting feedback on Usenet can pay off
many times over. Just think about dedicating hundreds of man-hours
and thousands of dollars to modems that refuse to work, and ask
yourself if the extra initial effort might be worth it.</p><p>Of course, standard PCs can handle a pair of modems at best.
How do you connect all of these modems to your PC? The answer is
through one of the many port-servers (also known as terminal
servers) available on the open market. Port servers connect to your
modems with built-in serial ports and forward data back and forth
between them and your computer, usually over a network.
Alternatively, you can use an &ldquo;intelligent serial board&rdquo; which
connects the modems directly to a PC. A good review of intelligent
serial boards can be found in the June, 1995 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> on page 46. Remember to include
a port server or intelligent serial board in your plans.</p><p>Then there is your network itself. Unless you plan to fulfill
all of your requirements with one machine (usually not a good
idea), you will need a network to connect your machines. While Fast
Ethernet, FDDI, and ATM are all options, plain vanilla 10 Mbps
Ethernet is usually the way to go. I recommend 10-base-T
(twisted-pair 4-conductor cable with a hub) over 10-base-2 (coaxial
wire with T-connectors and terminators). 10b2 is simply not
reliable enough to avoid service disruptions as you remove machines
from the network, rearrange your network with expansion, and trip
over the network cable. If you decide on the 10bT route, remember
to equip all of your machines with Ethernet cards (anywhere from
$30 to $300 each) and buy an Ethernet hub (between $400 and $1500).
The NET-2-HOWTO includes an excellent discussion of the merits of
the various ethernet cards; ISA bus ne2000 clones offer an easy and
very inexpensive solution.</p><p>Presumably, you have arranged an Internet connection, either
through one of the nationwide services such as Sprint, MCI, and
ANS, or through another regional ISP. Traditionally, this
connection is done via a dedicated router. Cisco Systems makes the
best high-speed routers available, but they are usually overkill
for connections of T1 speed or less. Livingston routers are a
particular favorite among the Linux community, and other options
also exist. An increasingly popular option is to make your own
router out of a Linux-based PC, using a T1-interface card from a
manufacturer like Enhanced Technologies. If you have an ISDN
connection, then you can use your Linux box as a router too,
through an ISDN terminal adapter from 3COM, Boca, Motorola, and
others.</p><p>Finally, you have to decide how many Linux machines you will
need. This all depends on how you have designed your network. There
are two big mistakes that people make. On the one hand, some assume
that every little network function needs a dedicated server. &ldquo;We
have to have a dedicated DNS, a dedicated web server, a dedicated
FTP server, a dedicated mail server...&rdquo; This can become very
expensive, very quickly, and unnecessarily so. On the other hand, I
have seen people make the mistake of cramming news, mail, PPP, and
web service all on one machine, which is so slow that their
customers leave as fast as they come in the door.</p><p>What hardware will younee and how should it be connected? How
much will it cost? Through the rest of this article, we'll look at
the service you can offer as an ISP and what kind of setup you'll
need to do provide it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b6ef8"></a>Let's Linux!</h2></div></div><p>The Linux kernel only offers the basics of an operating
system. You must chose one of the many Linux distributions to use
on your system. ISPs have a number of specific concerns which might
not coincide with the general user's, and foremost among these are
<span   class="bold"><b>upgradeability</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>coherence</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>network integrity</b></span>.</p><p>Upgradeability is essential to the ISP because of two
competing demands. First, you will need to offer the latest and
greatest solutions. The Internet protocol suite of services is
constantly growing, and the reason we have distributions in the
first place is so that we all don't have to port, clean up, and
install the various software packages on our systems by ourselves.
Secondly, your service must be reliable. This means that when you
do want to upgrade your system, taking it down, formatting the hard
drive, and installing a new distribution is not a very good
option.</p><p>By coherence, I mean how well the various components of your
system fit together. For example, installing Wietse Venema's TCP
wrapper (/sbin/tcpd) is not a trivial exercise, mostly because you
must coordinate it with the various weird features of your network
daemons. Slackware and most other Linux distributions come with
tcpd built in and ready to go. A coherent Linux distribution saves
you a lot of effort, as you need not fix the mistakes in the
distribution.</p><p>Finally, you will live or die by the quality of your network
functions. Sloppy and/or buggy compilations of network utilities,
non-functioning daemons, or generally inferior network services are
unacceptable in your distribution.</p><p>New distributions are usually plagued by the latter two of
these problems, and this was the case with the early releases of
Red Hat. However, Red Hat is very easily upgradeable and has been
steadily improving the general quality of their product.
Additionally, if you are brave enough to try Linux on a Sparc or
Alpha, then Red Hat is probably the way to go.</p><p>Coherence and strength of network services have always made
Slackware a particular favorite of mine, and I have gotten a lot of
mileage out of it. It saddens me, therefore, that the persistence
of bugs in the distribution and, most of all, the impossibility of
upgrading a Slackware system are causing it to drop out of
favor.</p><p>My own bets are laid on Debian, a package maintained much as
the kernel is developed&mdash;by a team of people over the Internet.
Debian is still gearing up, and there have been problems with one
CD-ROM version of it, but I think that it holds the most
promise.</p><p>Speaking of CD-ROM problems, get ready for them. Many times I
have run into people who are having networking problems with a
CD-ROM version of Slackware, to whom I recommend reinstalling the
&ldquo;N&rdquo; section (networking) from an Internet source. More than 90%
of the time, this solves the problem. We have a T1 connection to
the Internet, and although we keep a CD-ROM version of Linux lying
around for safety reasons, I prefer installing directly from the
network, because if one vendor's CD-ROM version of Slackware is
broken, only their customers will know it, but if SunSITE's copy of
Slackware is broken, the whole world starts yelling.</p><p>Really, choosing a distribution depends more on what you're
familiar with than anything else. If you have experience with Red
Hat, for example, you will want to think seriously before selecting
a different distribution, as the pain of learning a new
distribution might be greater than the advantage to be
gained.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b73c8"></a>Networking&mdash;It's Not Who You Know, It's What You
Know</h2></div></div><p>Your major task after installing your new distribution is to
set up your network and get packets flowing. This is not the topic
of another article&mdash;it is the topic of a full-length book!
Fortunately, the Linux community is very responsive to the needs of
its customers (i.e., itself), and one of the main reasons to use
Linux is because of the documentation. You should read the
Net-2-HOWTO as an absolute minimum, and a copy of Olaf Kirch's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrator's Guide</em></span> (the
&ldquo;NAG&rdquo;) should sit on your desk within easy reach.</p><p>Of course, getting packets flowing is just your first concern
in establishing your network. There are 6 main topics which you
should consider: connecting customers, DNS, mail, news, Web/FTP,
and network security. We will examine each of these in turn.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b7580"></a>PPP or SLIP? Coke or Shasta?</h2></div></div><p>The Serial-Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) was a
ground-breaking development in computing. Then again, so was the
Apple II. While still in favor in certain circles, SLIP is dead and
should be recognized as such. Its successor, the Point-to-Point
Protocol, (PPP) is the wave of the future. (Okay, it was the wave
of a year ago, but you get the point.)</p><p>SLIP is firmly entrenched in second place to PPP for several
reasons. First of all, SLIP is only capable of serving IP traffic,
whereas you can run virtually anything over a PPP link, including
IP, AppleTalk, IPX, and others. Second, PPP's Link Quality
Management (LQM) functions give you a solid connection by running
it at the proper speed, regardless of electrical interference or
other line noise. Finally, the newer versions of PPP will have
world-class authentication, enhanced LQM, and other features, such
that PPP will continue to pull away from SLIP in terms of
quality.</p><p>Linux comes with both SLIP and PPP built in. Your kernel
needs to be compiled with <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> SLIP and PPP
support. Remember this when you install your system, or you will
rack your brains trying to figure out why one or the other is not
working when you try to use the missing one.</p><p>You will want to read the PPP-HOWTO, as it is invaluable in
understanding how to make PPP work. You will need to decide a
number of things, such as whether to give customers shells from
which to invoke PPP or make PPP their default login program.</p><p>Furthermore, how will you do the accounting for their time
on-line? The answer to the previous question might affect this one.
Adam McKee's BBS-Util might be helpful, as might a number of other
packages. Ask around, look around, or do what we did&mdash;write your
own.</p><p>Getting PPP/SLIP to work is a medium-sized job, and you will
want to test your setup via modem with as many different OSs as
possible. Win 3.11, Win95, OS/2 and OS/2 warp systems need to be
able to dial in, and you need to test all of these systems to make
sure that you can explain to your customers how to do it. Writing a
HOWTO for each OS as you test it is a good idea. And don't forget
your Macintosh customers! They suffer under the oppressive boot of
hegemony as much as MS Windows users do, and they usually make good
customers, as they are willing to pay good money for a product that
works.</p><p>A good decision might be to put your PPP customers on the
same machine as your mail server, making it easier to maintain only
one /etc/passwd file for the entire operation. pppd will use
username/password pairs from the /etc/passwd file, so throw that
pap-secrets file away!</p><p>PPP is fairly time-consuming to set up, and if you decide to
offer non-IP services, this, too, will take time. However, usually
once it's up, it's up, and you can go on to other problems. Just be
sure you have backups!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b7948"></a>DNS: What's in a Name?</h2></div></div><p>While computers understand 32-bit IP addresses, you and I
don't. My e-mail is tlewis@cheney.net, not tlewis@204.214.16.150
(although that works, too). The Domain Name System is the glue that
holds together domain names and IP numbers.</p><p>You do have an Internet domain name, don't you? You will need
one, and once you have it, you will need a Domain Name Server (DNS)
in order to use it. DNS setup is fairly straightforward, and I have
written a mini-HOWTO on the subject, which will be available from
the LDP archives by the time you read this. [FIXME: More
information coming here]</p><p>DNS places a very light load on a machine, and your DNS
server can serve in other capacities, too. Some people put it on
their PPP server, some on their news server. We have two: one on
our WWW server and the other on a 386-40 dedicated to DNS. To each
his own.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b7b00"></a>E-mail: It Makes the World Go 'Round</h2></div></div><p>E-mail is probably the most useful and the least appreciated
aspect of the Internet. Once you have tired of the pretty pictures
of the WWW and want to get some work done, e-mail is the tool of
choice. Nonetheless, people neglect it too often, at their
peril.</p><p>If your news server goes down, you will get some gripes, and
if your web server goes down, you will get some calls, but if mail
goes down, Annie bar the door! Your POP server (the program that
lets customers use programs like Eudora to read their mail) usually
works out of the box, but your SMTP daemon (such as sendmail) is
what does the heavy lifting, and this is where your efforts will be
directed.</p><p>The NAG includes a good section on mail, and the Mail-HOWTO
is also a good starting point. Mail is another of those services
with which, once you have it working, your problems are over, but
you will spend time getting it working properly. If customers want
UUCP, mailbots, or mailing-list support, this means additional
work, and you should consider the amount of additional work before
knee-jerking into a &ldquo;Sure, we can do it!&rdquo; response.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x16b7cb8"></a>News: In a Word... ARRGGHH!</h2></div></div><p>Usenet, the global electronic news system, is distributed
mainly over the Internet, although certain UUCP networks and others
also offer it. Simply put, any message written by anyone anywhere
submitted to public Usenet groups (1000, 4000, 10000&mdash;how many are
there?) will end up on every Usenet server on the planet. Last I
heard, a full Usenet feed (i.e., accepting every group) runs about
400MB per day, so you probably don't want a full Usenet feed coming
in over your 56kbps connection.</p><p>The News-HOWTO goes over the various options for news servers
(programs which accept deliveries, organize the articles, and spit
them back out to customers as they request them). Pick one, learn
it, and stick with it. At 400MB per day, news is an inherently
dangerous thing, kind of like having a water main feeding into your
sink, and you can lose control of your news server without a whole
lot of effort, filling disks and ruining your day.</p><p>News also exacts a heavy toll on the machine that serves it,
consuming large amounts of RAM, CPU cycles, and disk space. At the
very minimum, you will want your /var/spool/news directory on a
separate physical disk. Usually, it is a good idea to have a
separate news server, which perhaps also serves as a DNS. Our
486-DX66 groans slightly under a full news feed, and a Pentium
might not be a bad choice. Then again, you might not want to run a
full news feed, in which case a 486DX-33 might do the trick.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x1ab00c0"></a>Web and FTP: The Fun Stuff</h2></div></div><p>Slackware and most other distributions come with Washington
University's wu-ftpd anonymous FTP server built-in, preconfigured,
and ready to go. Go to /home/ftp/pub, start throwing stuff in
there, and you're off to the races. If your customers want to be
able to put up files for FTP on your server, then you might have
some work to do.</p><p>The WWW, despite all the hype, is not especially difficult to
implement, either. Apache, a derivative of NCSA's httpd, is a
favorite Linux tool and comes with plenty of neat gizmos. Virtually
all web servers are capable of serving information from a
public_html directory in a user's home directory, accessible as
<a href="http://www.foobar.com/~username/" target="_self">www.foobar.com/~username/</a>.
If you decide to do this, you will want to put your web daemon on
the same machine as your users' home directories, which may also be
your mail machine. If this, along with PPP, is too much, break out
your PPP server and leave mail and web on the one machine. Plus,
you can have users access this one central machine via multiple PPP
servers (even via multiple remote PPP servers across your greater
metro area), instead of having each server duplicate these
functions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x1ab0278"></a>Network Security: I Could Tell You, But Then I'd
Have to Kill You</h2></div></div><p>ISPs offer access to their networks to people they usually
have never met. As such, you will need to keep a constant eye on
the security aspects of your system. Start with a good introduction
to network security, such as Cheswick and Bellovin's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Firewalls and Internet Security</em></span>, which served
as my introduction to networking in general.</p><p>A good place to start is with a packet filter on the router
connecting you to the Internet. A good packet filter and careful
password management are two small steps that will put to rest 90%
of your security concerns. The most important step you can take
with Internet security is to understand it and to use the tools
(like TCP wrapper and packet filters) at your disposal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15be580.0x1ab0430"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The above descriptions cover the high spots of all the issues
which you will face in starting up an ISP business using Linux. It
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> doable; we at Cheney Communications and
countless other ISPs are living proof of this.</p><p>You will have problems with your network. You should get used
to that fact now. Fortunately, the good people on Usenet in
comp.os.linux.networking (myself included) are always ready to
help. The Linux Documentation Project is an invaluable resource
when trouble arises. It is even more useful
<span   class="bold"><b>before</b></span> trouble arises!</p><p>By now you should have a pretty good idea of what equipment
you will need in order to start dishing out IP services. Are you
going to offer limited Usenet and e-mail to a few businesses? An
ISDN connection and a pair of 486DX-66s should do the trick. Are
you starting up a full-service ISP for dial-up and leased-line
services, with a full news feed and commercial web hosting? Three
Pentiums (dedicated news server, dedicated PPP server, and a
mail/WWW machine) and a router might be a good start.</p><p>You need to make sure that you have all of your ducks in a
row as far as the business end of the operation. How will you keep
track of billing? What will you charge your customers? For what
services will you charge extra?</p><p>Is Linux the right operating system for you? If you have
experience with Berkeley-style systems, maybe NetBSD would be a
better choice in the short run. If you are in a corporate
environment and are setting up a network for your business, maybe
you can spend the extra money for the technical support of Solaris
or SCO. Then again, Linux has, in my opinion, a better range of
services than BSD, and technical support for Linux is available
from SSC and others, including several <i  >LJ</i>
advertisers. Instead of being locked into technical support from
one vendor, you have a choice. And why would anyone run SCO?</p><p>You should not be under the illusion that becoming an ISP is
easy. News will go haywire on you again and again if you are not an
expert (you will become one or die trying). The business can be
very competitive in different regions, and your dreams of wealth
and glitzy nerd-dom might die the hard death of too much work and
too little money.</p><p>Before investing the time and money in starting up an ISP
business, you should be sure of your ability to do it. If in
reading through the documentation mentioned above, you had trouble
understanding it and are not confident in your ability to pull it
off, maybe jumping right in is not the best decision. Again, Linux
comes to the rescue. You can get a dial-up account with another ISP
and set up a trial system on your PC at home. If you cannot handle
a partial news feed, your own mail server, a DNS, and a web daemon,
keep hacking at them until you can, and then reconsider starting
up. I can think of few deaths worse than being condemned to run a
network when you don't know what you're doing, especially if your
life's savings are riding on it.</p><p>Finally, to all of you startup ISPs out there, I wish you
good luck. With skill and hard work, it can be a rewarding
business, and you get the satisfaction of meeting interesting
customers and introducing them to the Internet. With the tools
which Linux provides, there is no reason why you cannot build a
first-rate network (and hopefully this article will help, too).
Simply be aware that you are not alone in the ISP market, and your
competitors will always be breathing down your neck. We might be
one of them.</p><p>Happy Linuxing!</p></div></div>
