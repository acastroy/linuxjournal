    The first conference of its kind, this historic meeting was
    attended by a small but knowledgeable group of freeware
    enthusiasts.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539348"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have just returned from spending four
days at the Freely Redistributable Software Conference. It was held
in Boston on February 2 thru 5 and sponsored by the Free Software
Foundation. The first conference of its kind, it was a real treat
to attend.
</p><p>With less than 200 attendees, it wasn't a large conference
but I feel it was very significant. For those of you who have
attended Usenix in the early to mid-80s, this conference has much
the same flavor. For those of you who didn't,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Nerdcon</em></span> might give you an idea of what I am
talking about.</p><p>It is not that the attendees were all Nerds but they weren't
marketing people or novices to computers.</p><p>Discussions tended to be serious and technical and the
participants had the knowledge to back up their positions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x25395b0"></a>How it Started</h2></div></div><p>The conference began on Friday night with a reception. It was
a good chance for attendees to meet each other. While I didn't see
any important decisions being made, it was my first chance to get a
feel for how significant the Linux influence would be.</p><p>Greg Wettstein of the Roger Maris Cancer Center came over to
talk to me and said he hoped to meet Linus. I pointed out Linus
who, along with his girlfriend, Tove, were at the next table. Greg
went over, introduced himself and hung out with Linus for quite a
while. Greg commented to me later on how impressed he was with
Linus, for his work on the system of course, but also as a person.
Greg was not the first or only person to make a very positive
personal comment about Linus. Many, including myself, think that
his personality, that is, his willingness to listen to other
opinions&mdash;good or bad&mdash;is one of the major reasons Linux has
become so popular. I think that his sense of humor is another
important contribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539710"></a>A Full Saturday</h2></div></div><p>Saturday offered a collection of tutorials including the two
half-day sessions I presented on Linux&mdash;Linux:An Open System for
Everyone and Installing and Running Linux. They were well attended
(about 30 students) and there were definitely some new converts to
Linux. While the tutorials were intended for Linux newcomers, there
were a few serious Linux users in attendance. The general
conclusion was that we had a good time and everyone learned
something.</p><p>The auxiliary meeting location was the Cambridge Brewing
Company (CBC), a brewpub with good food and good brew about two
blocks away from the conference hotel. Linus and a large group of
Linux-followers ended up there on Saturday night; ten of us
including Dan Quinlan, Jon &ldquo;Maddog&rdquo; Hall, Erik Troan, Donnie
Barnes, Eric Raymond ended up there for lunch on Sunday and another
group including Greg Wettstein, Steve Imlach, Tom Sargent and
Bryttan Bradley and myself ended up there on Sunday night.</p><p>While there were other important ideas discussed at CBC such
as convincing <span   class="emphasis"><em>60 Minutes</em></span> that they should do a
segment on Linus and Linux, the quality of their stout was an
important consideration. Personally I would call it a thumbs
up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539920"></a>The Sunday Conference</h2></div></div><p>This was the only day of open sessions. The first keynote (by
Linus) and five of the ten sessions were on an aspect or use of
Linux. The sidebar outlines all the sessions and tells you how you
can get a copy of the proceedings.</p><p>Sunday started off with a keynote by Linus (after I had fun
waking up the crowd and attempting to make Linus sound like an
important mainstream executive).</p><p>Linus originally planned his keynote around being the Dr.
Ruth Westheimer of Software. With a fake German accent he intended
to ask questions like &ldquo;Do you go blind if you program alone?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Is it ok to date different operating systems?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I know
when I met the right OS?&rdquo;</p><p>He then intended to continue by answering the questions. But,
that didn't work out so he went on to his second idea, &ldquo; Software
is almost but not quite totally like sex&rdquo;. He decided it just
didn't have the same zing to it so he went on to present a talk
titled &ldquo;Write Free Software, Travel the World and Meet
People&rdquo;.</p><p>He said &ldquo;Rather than writing a great operating system I
wrote a small, not so great operating and then made it free. That
turned it into a great operating system.&rdquo; Certainly the right
attitude to take at the conference and, in practice, it seems like
he is right.</p><p>I personally found great interest in Victor Yodaiken's talk
about using Linux at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
Briefly, what he has done is slipped a real-time kernel between
Linux and the hardware. This had made it possible to handle hard
real-time processing (this is where processes must run at a
required time, not just &ldquo;soon&rdquo; and yet still have the utility and
versatility of a general purpose operating system running on the
same hardware. Victor has promised <i  >Linux Journal</i> an article on his work.</p><p>There is an interesting comment in the conference paper on
the Yugoslav Experience that helps support the idea that Linux is
viable in an open market: &ldquo;even though the price of pirated
commercial Unix-like operating systems is comparable to the price
of Linux, and with practically no legal limitations to using
pirated copies, Linux is being more widely used for Internetting in
both [the] academic community and companies.&rdquo;</p><p>The next presentation was on Linux on the OSF Mach3
Microkernel. This fits in with Apple's announcement of Linux on the
PowerMac. Let's just say this was a surprise. Michael addresses
this subject in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stop the Presses</em></span>.</p><p>Greg Wettstein presented a talk on his work with Linux at the
Roger Maris Cancer Center. An article on his work appeared in
<i  >Linux Journal</i> issue 5. To condense a serious
effort into a sentence, the cancer center is using over 30 Linux
workstations running a custom-built patient care information system
using Perl and Tcl/Tk.</p><p>In the following session, Erik Troan presented a talk on the
package management system developed at Red Hat software. This
package, RPM, makes in possible to easily update an existing Linux
system. The bottom line is that Red Hat is encouraging vendors of
Linux software to use their packaging method. This will make it
easier to distribute and maintain software for Linux.</p><p>Monday I decided to play the role of student instead of
presenter and attended Tom Christiansen's all-day Perl tutorial. At
lunch we had a lively discussion of Linux, NetBSD, software
licenses, is Emacs the answer to the world's problems and all those
other important subjects.</p><p>During the afternoon I mentioned to Tom that I was glad I had
proofed Arnold Robbin's (excellent) Awk book before attending the
Perl session because of the confusion that ensues when I am trying
to think in Awk and Perl at the same time. This led Arnold and Tom
into a &ldquo;which is better&rdquo; discussion at afternoon break. No
bloodshed and I think they are both right but it was interesting to
listen to them. As I have been an Awk user for about ten years and
am just starting to work with Perl, I intend to write an article or
two for <i  >LJ</i> on how I see the two languages fitting into the
world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2539f50"></a>Words from Other Attendees</h2></div></div><p>While I found the conference extremely interesting and
valuable I wanted to get feedback from others. Here is what a few
attendees had to say.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Russell NelsonCrynwr
Software,
<a href="mailto:nelson@crynwr.com">nelson@crynwr.com</a></b></span>Cool
stuff: Meeting people f2f (including Linux &amp;&amp; girlfriend
[Tove], Peter Deutsch, Tom Christiansen, Greg Wettstein and that
fyl fellow. Badges with e-mail addresses on them, so you'd know who
people are.
</p><p>Uncool stuff: The price relative to the length. ... Badges
printed with a too-small font, so I had to squint at people's
chests to know who they were. ... I like to call it freed software.
It's a little ungainly, but it carries more information than the
confusing appellation &ldquo;free&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>L. Peter DeutschAlladin Enterprises,
<a href="mailto:ghost@aladdin.com">ghost@aladdin.com</a></b></span>Cool
stuff: the two keynote talks. I found Stallman's quite inspiring in
terms of getting a more spiritual/emotional understanding of the
&ldquo;free&rdquo; software concept. Meeting people face to face. Having the
opportunity to present my own twist on &ldquo;free&rdquo; software to a lot
of people who didn't entirely agree with it. The gamelan concert.
The free Linux CD-ROMs.</p><p>Uncool stuff: I second Russell [Nelson]'s comment on price
versus length. If I hadn't been presenting a paper, I probably
wouldn't have come. The small attendance, presumably arising from
the short notice.</p><p>(Russ and Peter's comments continued from each other. Russ
commented that he thinks the FPL (which is what his paper was on)
encourages free software even more than the GPL. He points out that
products live and die by market share.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Steve ImlachSynergy,
<a href="mailto:si@synergy.encinitas.ca.us">si@synergy.encinitas.ca.us</a></b></span>My
eyes have been opened to some great opportunities in our area using
Linux on our hardware and some contributions that we may provide to
the continuing Linux development.</p><p>First, I thought it was a good sign to see in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Boston Globe</em></span> Business section about Apple and
the Linux server on top of the Mach kernel. This is some good
stuff. Synergy is already at work with the Mach 3 kernel and would
be very interested in getting more information in this area.</p><p>Since we are manufacturers of high performance Single Board
Computers, we are interested in first, porting Linux and second,
helping with the real-time development. Synergy is also highly
interested because it would not only help us in performance but
also improve the bottom line to our customers.</p><p>The ideas keep coming. Linux can also provide a high
performance testing environment for our boards because we would
have the source to tweak in any areas we deem to be a snappy
enhancement.</p><p>It's just a matter of getting started. I see a lot of full
weekends ahead. Luckily, unlike our FSF friends, I have a job that
supports this development in an ugly capitalistic evil manner. You
know, it's the profit mongers like Synergy that donate to the FSF
year after year because we haven't learned to steal what is free
yet.</p><p>Ok, that was a little jab at RMS. His speech was a little
tainted, I thought. His story about the &ldquo;community&rdquo; in college
reminded me of how I felt when I played ball at school. I was sad
it was ending and about the <span   class="emphasis"><em>camaraderie</em></span> I felt
should never end. The thing is, you move on. That is not to say,
however, that the same type of teamwork couldn't happen at the
workplace. He shouldn't knock it. Has he tried it? I think he is
exactly right when he says he doesn't like the competition. There
is plenty of it out here in the real world. What could he do if he
was pushed via that competition. Too bad. FSF stuff is used
everywhere and has great admirers here at Synergy as reflected by
the annual donations. I believe he should balance his remarks to
reflect what is really allowing the FSF to survive. Cooperation
with the business community. He seems to affect a lot of views in
the FSF &ldquo;community&rdquo;.</p><p>Linus was the type of guy I would like to work with. He
certainly shows it in the product and the way he handles himself
while juggling everyone's ideas, good and bad. It's no wonder that
he is such a popular fellow. I hope I may be factor in the coming
days along with other engineers at Synergy that are more
experienced than I in the advancement of real-time Linux. First,
there will be the Linux learning curve as we delve through the
source ...</p><p>Dr. Greg was inspirational and a great new-found friend. We
talked about just about everything and he is just the type a person
that you would want to help up at Roger Maris cancer center in N.D.
What was really amazing was watching him and Tom Sargent
(Synergy-Tucson) talk forever about everything from Cancer research
to spelunking to circus maneuvers in vintage aircraft to man-eating
viruses found in the depths of Africa. These guys need to have a
talk show on cable.</p><p>P.S. Linus Torvalds deserves great credit for the revolution
of free OS. What is his status now and how does he get support for
the continuing effort? I am also forwarding this to Dr. Greg. I
would like to see how his efforts are paying off up there in what
would otherwise be a drain on the spirit of a mere mortal.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dr. G.W. WettsteinOncology Research

I enjoyed the opportunity we had to visit at the conference (and
the beer). I think the Conference on Freely Redistributable
Software was important for its implications about the entry of free
software into commercial venues. This was probably demonstrated
most appropriately by a sampling of the selected papers. Of
particular interest was the paper from the Apple/OSF consortium as
well as the papers from the group working through SBIR and Peter
Deutsch's thoughts on marketing. Hopefully my discussion of our
accomplishments at the RMCC were helpful in this area as
well.</p><p>The impact of redistributable sources on the commercial arena
was also underscored by the presence of commercial enterprises at
the conference. Of notable interest was the presence of Apple and
representatives from HP and Synergy Systems. Apple's presence was
extremely important with their announcement that Linux would assume
a role in their strategic presence and would be marketed as an
Apple offering. Who would have ever thought that an organization
such as Apple, which considers software as strategically central to
their business plan, would consider free software as a viable
marketing tool.</p><p>What I found extremely interesting were discussions with
Steve Imlach and Tom Sargent from Synergy Systems. Their interest
in Linux is specifically for the strategic advantage that it will
confer on their hardware marketing efforts. Their group feels that
Linux represents a high quality solution which will allow them to
more effectively penetrate markets due to the cost advantage it
imparts to their hardware platform.</p><p>The implications of this are extremely important for the
freely distributable software movement. Steve Imlach indicated that
the leadership of Synergy is committed to the philosophy of free
software. This commitment includes monetary donations to the effort
as well as a commitment to release sources back into the Linux
kernel development stream. In my mind this is representative of the
wonderful synergy that can and should develop between commercial
enterprise and the free software movement.</p><p>In business parlance this is a win-win situation for everyone
involved. Commercial enterprises gain a strategic advantage and the
free software movement reaps monetary advantage. An even more
intrinsic advantage and one that must be carefully considered is
that the software remains free. Capitalism flourishes and
ultimately incubates the growth and development of freely
distributable software.</p><p>This conference came at a particularly important time for the
free software industry. If the concept is to move forward, it is
imperative that advocates join hands with commercial endeavors
wishing to exploit the benefits of free software. Niche markets
must be targeted and developed so as to promote commercialization
of free software with the ultimate benefit of subsequent
re-investment.</p><p>Phil Hughes, publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
probably phrased the imperative most correctly when he said, &ldquo;It
is time for Linux and free software to have applications and
markets which allow it to DO something.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x253abb0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Finally, here I am on a late night flight on my way back to
Seattle so I guess I am done with what I need to tell you about the
conference. We intend to keep up on plans for the next Freely
Redistributable Software Conference and will let you know about it
in plenty of time so you can attend. If you want to rub elbows with
some of the important people in the free software movement, get
genuinely inspired by the high interest level in Linux, learn
something new and maybe drink a real or virtual beer or two, it is
the right conference to attend.</p><p>&mdash;PH</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2441580.0x2932f60"></a>Conference Proceedings</h2></div></div><p>The following papers were presented at the Sunday conference.
