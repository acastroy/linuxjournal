    Steve Hughes proves that the Fortran Programming
    language's variety of high-quality programming tools and
    libraries provide a capability that, when coupled with all
    the features of Linux, makes for a potent programming
    platform for engineers and scientists.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2635580.0x272d4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Although demand for Linux support of
punch card readers has been light, there are still quite a of
number of us who learned to write computer code in the days when
programming prowess was judged by the size of your card deck in the
&ldquo;360&rdquo; queue. Of course, back then, Fortran was
<span   class="bold"><b>the</b></span> high level language of choice
for engineers and scientists, and it was the only programming
language many of us (including myself) ever learned.
</p><p>Many (well, maybe most) argue that Fortran is old-fashioned
compared to modern computer languages; but Fortran-trained
engineers, researchers, and scientists pay little heed to these
arguments. We view programming as simply a tool to accomplish our
goals, and we are most productive with familiar tools; therefore,
we stick with Fortran. Fortunately for us, Linux offers a rich
selection of Fortran programming tools.</p><p>This article surveys some of the basic tools available in
Linux for Fortran users migrating to Linux from a non-Unix
environment, such as VAX/VMS or DOS. My goal is to convince fellow
&ldquo;Fortran Fogeys&rdquo; that they can take the Linux plunge without
sacrificing their &ldquo;native&rdquo; programming capability. (It is worth
noting that Linux users ranked Fortran fifth out of twenty-five
programming languages in a recent <i  >Linux Journal</i> survey.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2635580.0x272d710"></a>Compiling Fortran Programs under Linux</h2></div></div><p>Several options exist for compiling FORTRAN 77 programs under
Linux. The most established method is a public domain Fortran-to-C
converter developed by AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Bellcore.
This Fortran converter, known as
<span   class="bold"><b>f2c</b></span>, is normally included in all
the popular Linux distributions. A second option is the newly
released GNU Fortran compiler known as
<span   class="bold"><b>g77</b></span> <a href="1168s1.html" target="_self">(see
sidebar)</a>. Because GNU g77 is still being beta-tested and is
not as widely distributed as f2c, this article is restricted to the
use of f2c. Finally, there are at least two commercial Fortran
compilers available for Linux: NAG's F90 Fortran 90 compiler and
Microway's NDP Fortran compiler.</p><p>The f2c converter reads the FORTRAN 77 source file and
converts it into equivalent C language source code. This sounds
like an impossible feat, but the f2c developers have done a
remarkable implementation. The second step involves compiling the
resulting C code using the GNU C compiler, gcc. Included in this
step is the automatic creation of an executable file with proper
links to the necessary static and shared libraries.</p><p>As usual with Unix, the new user is faced with a bewildering
array of options associated with f2c and gcc. Fortunately, we have
been protected from the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; power of Unix by a bash shell
script called <span   class="bold"><b>f77</b></span>. This script has
fewer options, and it makes compiling Fortran programs easy by
serving as an interface to the f2c/gcc combination. In my Slackware
distribution, the f77 script is located in the /usr/bin directory.
I don't have a man page for f77, though it may exist. Fortunately,
all the information you need to get started with f77 is listed in
the first 18 lines of the f77 script itself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2635580.0x272da28"></a>Using f77</h2></div></div><p>The simple program listed below illustrates the basics of
compiling Fortran programs under Linux. (I know the subroutine is
not really necessary, but I have included it to illustrate some
points later in the article.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">

      END
</pre><p>Compiling and linking our example program, named f77demo.f,
is easy (in this article, the commands that you type are preceded
by the shell prompt <b  >$.</b>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f77 -o demoexe f77demo.f
  f2ctmp_f77demo.f:
     MAIN f77demo:
     trig:
</pre><p>No errors are listed, so we know the <b  >MAIN</b>
program and subroutine <b  >trig</b> compiled
successfully. The executable file, demoexe, is ready to run by
simply typing <b  >demoexe</b> on the command line. (If
demoexe is not in your <b  >$PATH</b>, you will have to
indicate where it is&mdash;in this case, by typing
<b  >./demoexe</b>.) In the compilation process, the f77
script also created an object module with the name
f77demo.o.</p><p>The f77 script expects the Fortran source code to be in a
file having the .f extension. If you are porting code having a
different file extension, such as .FOR or .FTN, change it to .f.
(When porting DOS files, use the fromdos program to strip
line-ending Control-M and file-ending Control-Z characters. If you
don't have the fromdos program, try using the shell script in
<a href="1168l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a>) The
<b  >-o</b> switch tells the script to create an
executable file having the name demoexe (in this example). Without
this switch, the executable file name defaults to a.out.</p><p>More than one source file can be compiled into the executable
module using f77. For example, if we break our example program into
two files called maindemo.f and trig.f, our command line would
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f77 -o demoexe maindemo.f trig.f
</pre><p>This usage might be typical for programs containing only a
few subroutines. For large program development, the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> utility can be used for more
efficiency. [See <i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue 6 or read
the GNU make manual.  &mdash;ED] The f77 script also allows you to compile
Fortran, C, and assembly source files at the same time by including
the source file names on the command line. This activity will be
left as an exercise for the reader...</p><p>Among the several f77 command line options there are two that
are particularly useful. The first is the <b  >-c</b>
option. This option tells f77 to create an object module, but not
an executable. For example, the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f77 -c trig.f
</pre><p>will result in the creation of the object file trig.o in your
present working directory. Why would we want to do this? One reason
is to create our own custom object libraries of Fortran-callable
subroutines using the library manager available with Linux. Another
reason is to create dynamic links between Fortran subroutines and
other Linux programs (more later!).</p><p>The second important f77 switch is the
<b  >-l<i><tt>lib</tt></i></b> option. This
option is used to tell the gcc compiler to search for subroutine
calls in user-supplied libraries normally not examined by gcc.
Static object libraries have the naming convention
<b  >lib<i><tt>mystuff</tt></i>.a</b> where
the name used in the <b  >-l</b> option is the part
wedged between <b  >lib</b> and <b  >.a</b>.
Shared libraries also begin with <b  >lib</b>, but have
an extension similar to <b  >.so.#.##.#</b>, where the
#-sign is replaced by numbers corresponding to the library
version.</p><p>Including libraries when compiling a Fortran program is
illustrated by the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f77 -o foobar foobar.f -lmystuff -lmorestuff
</pre><p>During compilation the gcc compiler will search the
libmystuff.a and libmorestuff.a libraries (in that order) for any
unresolved subroutine and function calls. The order of the
libraries is important. Suppose each library contained an object
module named <b  >gag</b>. Any calls to
<b  >gag</b> in the program foobar.f will be resolved by
the <b  >gag</b> object module in the first library,
libmystuff.a.</p><p>It is important to remember that the <b  >-l</b>
option should always follow the list of source files. By default,
f77 searches the f2c (libf2c.so.0) library and the math intrinsics
library m (libm.so.4) before searching libraries specified on the
command line. These libraries provide system calls, Fortran I/O
functions, mathematical intrinsic functions, and run-time
initialization.</p><p>A common gcc compiler error stems from the compiler being
unable to locate a user-specified library. If this happens, you
will need to determine which directories are searched for
libraries. Then, either relocate your library to a valid library
directory or create a symbolic link to your library from one of the
library directories. You can also add directories to the library
path on the f77 command line using the <b  >-L</b>
switch.</p><p>The above examples should be enough to get you started making
use of Fortran in Linux using f77. Of course, more flexibility is
offered using the f2c/gcc combination because more options are
available. (f2c and gcc have good man pages, so I don't need to
describe them here.) For example, the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f2c f77demo.f
</pre><p>creates the file f77demo.c, and:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ gcc -o demoexe f77demo.c -lf2c -lm
</pre><p>creates the demoexe executable, and together they are
equivalent to the f77 command shown earlier. Notice that we had to
include the f2c and m libraries explicitly this time&mdash;and they must
be listed in this order. Failure to include these two libraries
would cause the compiler to complain. For example, leaving off the
<b  >-lm</b> option for our example program produces the
errors:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Undefined symbol _exp referenced from text segment
Undefined symbol _sin referenced from text segment
</pre><p>because the references to the <b  >sine</b> and
<b  >exponential</b> functions in subroutine
<b  >TRIG</b> could not be resolved.</p><p>Finally, you may be interested in trying out a newer Perl
driver script called fort77. It is billed as a replacement for f77,
and it includes support for debugging, a feature missing from f77.
I haven't tried fort77 yet, but it is definitely on my list of
things to do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2635580.0x2725650"></a>Finding Fortran Program Errors</h2></div></div><p>Two methods exist for tracking down compiling errors in your
Fortran source code: compiler messages and &ldquo;lints&rdquo;. Error
messages reported by the gcc compiler are helpful, and this may be
adequate for relatively simple programs. For example, suppose I
made an error in the main program shown in the first example by
forgetting to put in the statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 10   CONTINUE
</pre><p>that was line 11. Furthermore, assume I also messed up the
array declaration in the subroutine <b  >trig</b> by
typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
      DIMENSION X(1)
</pre><p>instead of</p><pre     class="programlisting">
      DIMENSION X(1), Y(1)
</pre><p>(Hey, it could happen!) Attempting to compile this incorrect
program, now named baddemo.f, results in the following error
sequence:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f77 -o baddemo baddemo.f
f2ctmp_baddemo.f:
   MAIN f77demo:
Error on line 17 of f2ctmp_baddemo.f:
 DO loop or BLOCK IF not closed
Error on line 17 of f2ctmp_baddemo.f:
 missing statement label 10
   trig:
Error on line 22 of f2ctmp_baddemo.f:
 statement function y amid executables.
Warning on line 25 of f2ctmp_baddemo.f:
 local variable sin never used
Warning on line 25 of f2ctmp_baddemo.f:
 local variable exp never used
</pre><p>The error messages give information to help isolate the
problems, but the line numbers don't always seem to correspond to
the the line numbers of the original Fortran source. This makes it
a little harder to track down obscure errors, especially in longer
programs. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an option in f77
or f2c to generate a program listing with line numbers. (That
doesn't mean it can't be done!)</p><p>In addition to compiler error messages, there are several
source code checkers or &ldquo;lints&rdquo; that can be used to help isolate
errors in the source code. An easy-to-use checking program is
<span   class="bold"><b>ftnchek</b></span>. In its simplest usage,
ftnchek examines your program for a variety of potential errors,
and it can make life easier by generating a program listing.
ftnchek has a long list of options and a thorough man page.
Remember, Fortran checking programs will not identify all the
errors in your program. However, the combination of a checker and
f77 error messages should help you combat compilation errors. (Of
course, careful programming will help as well!)</p><p>The hard-core (and really adventurous) programmer can obtain
a package called <span   class="bold"><b>Toolpack</b></span> from the
usual Linux sites. This large package is a set of programs and C
shell scripts that provides rigorous FORTRAN 77 code checking,
along with static and dynamic analysis. See the Fortran_FAQ
(directory /usr/doc/faq/lang in the Slackware distribution) for a
description of <span   class="bold"><b>Toolpack</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2635580.0x2725c28"></a>Fortran Tools and Libraries</h2></div></div><p>Fortran's main usage has been in the scientific and
engineering fields, and because the language has survived for
decades, thousands of high-quality programs and subroutine
libraries exist, many of which are freely available. These programs
include application programs written for specific purposes,
mathematical subroutine libraries, general purpose run-time
routines, and graphical plotting and display packages.</p><p>Describing even a small percentage of available programs is
impossible, but you can get a rough idea of what's out there by
pointing your Web browser at
<a href="http://netlib2.cs.utk.edu" target="_self">netlib2.cs.utk.edu</a>.
This site is the Netlib Repository at UTK/ORNL, and it archives
over 100 packages containing mathematical software, papers, and
databases. Fortran programmers will be particularly interested in a
&ldquo;code motherlode&rdquo; collection called
<span   class="bold"><b>slatec</b></span>. This is a
&ldquo;...comprehensive library containing over 1400 general purpose
mathematical and statistical routines written in FORTRAN 77.&rdquo;
(Source code, folks!) To give an idea of the
<span   class="bold"><b>slatec</b></span> library's magnitude, its
Table of Contents takes up 222,161 bytes on my disk.</p><p>One key factor in my decision to use Linux as a Fortran
programming platform was the
<span   class="bold"><b>PGPLOT</b></span> package. This highly
versatile Fortran library provides 100 primitive and higher level
subroutines for drawing scientific graphs on various graphic
display devices. For example, with the PGPLOT library, you can
create multiple graphs in multiple X windows, output plots to
PostScript and other supported printing devices, or create files
that are compatible with HPGL format or Latex picture
environment.</p><p>In addition to Linux, PGPLOT is available for twelve other
flavors of Unix (AIX, Cray, HP, SGI, NeXT, etc.), two versions of
OpenVMS, and MS-DOS using Microsoft Power Station 32-bit Fortran.
This wide availability is an attractive feature if you want to
develop consistent Fortran applications across platforms. I am also
informed that PGPLOT capabilities are available in a compiled form
(PGPERL) for use with Perl scripts.</p><p>A simple demonstration of PGPLOT is provided by the program
listed below. This program is the same as the one given previously,
with nine (indented) lines of code added to create a simple
plot.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

programs running under Linux. If you deal with matrix or vector
data, signal analysis, nonlinear optimization, plotting, or other
mathematical manipulations, you owe it to yourself to explore this
feature-packed program. (SciLab was reviewed in <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
Issue 11, and it is available for a variety of other computer
platforms, including Sun Sparc station, IBM RS 6000, HP 9000, DEC
Mips, and DEC Alpha.)</p><p>Beyond the hundreds of built-in or supplied mathematical
functions, SciLab users can also dynamically link their own Fortran
and C subroutines to the SciLab binary without recompiling the
SciLab source code. The linked subroutines are then available for
calling from within SciLab using either interactive commands or by
executing scripts.</p><p>This important feature allows Fortran users (and C
programmers) to make use of &ldquo;tried and true&rdquo; source code without
the trouble of converting the subroutines to equivalent SciLab
macros and scripts that use built-in SciLab functions. Just as
important, tedious debugging can be kept to a minimum (provided the
linked subroutines have already been tested thoroughly).</p><p>Returning once again to our original trivial example code,
let's link the subroutine <b  >TRIG</b> into a SciLab
session. First, we need to compile the <b  >TRIG</b>
object module using the f77 command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ f77 -c trig.f
</pre><p>which produces trig.o in the present working directory. From
within Scilab we link trig.o using the <b  >link</b>
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt;link('trig.o','trig')
 linking  "trig_" defined in "trig.o "
 lastlink 0,0
</pre><p>The first argument string in the <b  >link</b>
command is the name (case sensitive) of the Fortran object module.
If this module is not in the current SciLab working directory, you
must include the path. The second argument string must be the exact
name of the Fortran subroutine being linked; however, case is not
important. (Note that SciLab variables are case-sensitive, so
subsequent use of <b  >trig</b> within SciLab requires
that you use lower case.)</p><p>Other subroutines also can be linked in the same way, and
SciLab lists all linked subroutines when the
<b  >link</b> command is issued without arguments,
i.e.:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt;link()
 ans  =
 trig
</pre><p>Now we are ready to use <b  >trig</b> in our SciLab
session, but first we need to specify the two input variables
<b  >(n,x)</b> for the <b  >trig</b>
subroutine. Below are the commands issued with Scilab echoing the
results.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt;n=5
 n  =
    5.
--&gt;x=[.1 .2 .3 .4 .5]
 x  =
!    .1     .2     .3     .4     .5 !
</pre><p>Actually calling <b  >trig</b> is done using
SciLab's <b  >fort</b> command as illustrated below
(along with the result) for our example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt;y=fort('trig',n,1,'i',x,2,'r','out',[1,5],3,'r')
 y  =
! .0903330 .1626567 .2189268 .2610349 .2907863 !
</pre><p>Okay, now for the explanation. On the left-hand side of the
entered expression is a list of the subroutine output variables
(<b  >y</b> in this example). The arguments inside the
fort expression consist of three groups. First is the called
subroutine name (<b  >trig</b>) as a string variable.
This is followed by a list of the subroutine input variables, given
in this example as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
n,1,'i', x,2,'r'
</pre><p>The first three items are the input variable
<b  >(n)</b>, its position in the <b  >trig</b>
subroutine argument list <b  >(1)</b>, and a string
character representing the variable's type (<b  >i</b>
for integer). Likewise, the second input variable is the real
array, <b  >x</b>, positioned as the second argument in
<b  >trig</b>. This pattern continues until all the input
variables are listed. Variables in the input list do not have to be
listed in any particular order. In other words, we could have just
as easily listed the inputs as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
x,2,'r', n,1,'i'
</pre><p>Once all the input variables are listed, we can specify the
output variable or variables, denoted in this example by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
'out',[1,5],3,'r'
</pre><p>The key word <b  >'out'</b> always appears,
followed by a matrix notation informing SciLab that the output
variable, <b  >y</b>, is a 1x5 array. The
<b  >3</b> gives the position of <b  >y</b> in
the subroutine's argument list, and <b  >r</b> states
that the variable is type real.</p><p>Subroutines having more than one output variable simply need
to list the parameters associated with each variable on the output
side in the <b  >fort</b> argument list and include each
variable on the left-hand side of the expression. For example,
assume we have a Fortran subroutine given by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SUBROUTINE WIN95(IDEAS,BUGS,DOS,DELAY)
REAL*4 BUGS(1,1), DOS, DELAY(1)
INTEGER*2 IDEAS
.
.
.
RETURN
END
</pre><p>The input variables are <b  >DOS</b> and
<b  >IDEAS</b>, and the outputs are
<b  >BUGS</b> and <b  >DELAY</b>. After
compiling and linking this subroutine into SciLab, it is called
by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--&gt;bugs,delay]=fort('win95',dos,3,'r',ideas,1,'i',
                 'out'[99,99],2,'r',[1,10],4,'r')
</pre><p>It's as easy as that!</p><p>When coupling Fortran subroutines with SciLab, any
<b  >print</b> statements within your Fortran subroutines
will not print to the SciLab session. Instead they print to the X
window from which you started SciLab (or on the console monitor if
you loaded Scilab from a window manager, such as FVWM). More
importantly, the dynamically linked Fortran subroutines can
<b  >open, read, write</b>, and <b  >close</b>
disk files. Subroutines containing <b  >COMMON</b> blocks
must be restructured to accept all the variables and constants
through the <b  >fort</b> command line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2635580.0x2a3c278"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The Fortran programming language is reasonably well supported
in the Linux environment. Furthermore, a variety of high-quality
programming tools and libraries provide a capability that, when
coupled with all the features of Linux, makes for a potent
programming platform for engineers and scientists.</p><p>In the future we can expect a robust g77 compiler with
debugger support, continued improvement in existing support
libraries, and release of new Fortran tools. Perhaps even more
exciting is work being done by the Linux-Lab Project. This project
is developing drivers to support acquisition of laboratory and
field data using Linux. Higher-level interface to most hardware
devices will be via C language libraries, which (we hope) will also
be callable from our Fortran programs.</p><p>So <a href="1168r1.html" target="_self">take the plunge,</a> you
Fortran fanatics! It will be an exciting adventure!</p><p>Thanks to Tony Dalrymple, Rod Sobey, and Gary Howell for

      Fortran program over 25 years ago using FORTRAN 66 (or maybe that
      was FORTRAN 1.0?). Cycling and two teenage daughters keep Steve and
      his wife fit and frenzied, respectively.
