The technical and financial barriers for entry into the world of cell-phone interception technologies seem to be on a race to the bottom.
Building a device for intercepting cell-phone calls is something one can
accomplish without a deep knowledge of GSM networks for around $600.

</p><p>
Sometimes labeled as IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
catchers, Cell Site Simulators or Evil BTS (Base Transceiver Station),
these devices can be used to identify an individual cell-phone account
holder by fooling the phone into transmitting the IMSI, which is a unique
ID burned into your phone's SIM card. Moreover, these devices can be used
to record cell-phone conversations and SMS messages. To complicate the
issue, cell phones, by default, don't have a method for ascertaining the
trustworthiness of the BTS before association (this is specifically a problem with
2.5G GSM networks). The implications are
serious for everyone from foreign media correspondents to CFOs, where
an intercepted conversation could compromise the safety of a source
or lead to insider trading or even market manipulation.
</p><p>
Without a doubt, the use of such a device is quite illegal. Detection,
however, proves challenging. Without installing software onto
your smartphone to interrogate the cell radio&mdash;see AIMSICD (<a href="https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector" target="_self">https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector</a>) and Femto
Catcher (<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/femtocatcher" target="_self">https://github.com/iSECPartners/femtocatcher</a>)&mdash;you don't have a
great way to know if your phone is associating with a known good BTS.
Established open-source detection methods often have revolved around the
use of Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) in a dedicated piece of hardware or
installing software on the phone itself to put the handset into airplane
mode in the event that a questionable BTS association occurs.
</p><p>
Rogue BTS detection has found its way into commercial offerings with
PwnieExpress and Bastille Networks, but you're not here for a commercial
product pitch, and the author doesn't work for either of those companies.
The author is pitching SITCH, which stands for Situational Information
from Telemetry and Correlated Heuristics. SITCH is open-source, the cost
per-sensor is around $150, and you easily can source the parts from your
favorite maker-oriented electronics vendor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25cc580.0x26c4618"></a>
Current Detection Methods</h2></div></div><p>
Before looking at how SITCH works and how to set it up, let's have a
closer look at currently available methods for solving the problem of
detection. One of the projects that inspired the early design of SITCH
is Pedro Cabrera's FakeBTS (<a href="http://fakebts.com/en" target="_self">fakebts.com/en</a>). It uses a Bash script to coordinate and
analyze output from Airprobe and Wireshark to track nearby BTSes. This is
an SDR-centric approach, which lends itself to using inexpensive hardware
and takes more of an objective approach to the detection of rogue BTSes.
Other methods, like the Android IMSI Catcher Detector (AIMSICD), involve
interrogating the phone's cell radio and, therefore, produce a more
subjective analysis, based on the radio's preference of nearby BTSes
for association. These represent two methods: SDR-based scanning and
GSM radio interrogation. Both of these methods are incorporated in SITCH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25cc580.0x26c4778"></a>
Solution Proposition</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SITCH Overview</b></span>
</p><p>
Now, let's consider how these methods come together in SITCH. SITCH
uses an SDR device for tracking the observed power of GSM channels.
The SDR USB dongle used in development is the RTL-SDR-based NESDR XTR
from NooElec. The open-source software tool used to operate the SDR
dongle and process the signal is called Kalibrate. Kalibrate typically
is used for determining the frequency offset for an SDR device. This is
necessary because the tuner components in software-defined radios are
notorious for drifting high or low, sometimes just because of a variation
in ambient temperature. I'm not using Kalibrate for determining frequency
offset here though. 
</p><p>
Kalibrate produces a number representing the power of the
signal for each channel it detects. For the remainder of this article,
I refer to this channel as ARFCN, which stands for Absolute
Radio Frequency Channel Number. Within each ARFCN, there is a frequency
correction channel. This is what GSM radios use to calibrate themselves.
Think of a musician using a tuning fork as a reference pitch for tuning
a horn. The Frequency Correction Channel (FCCH) is what Kalibrate
uses to produce a list of ARFCNs.
</p><p>
The SDR approach takes around seven minutes to scan an entire GSM band,
and it can positively detect when a femtocell goes live nearby. Femtocells
are the range-extender devices that your cell-phone provider will sell
you if you have bad reception indoors. Although these devices often
are legitimate, they haven't proven invulnerable. Live hacking of a femtocell
has been demonstrated (<a href="https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2013/august/femtocell-presentation-slides-videos-and-app" target="_self">https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2013/august/femtocell-presentation-slides-videos-and-app</a>), and it's just as effective as an evil BTS at
capturing communications traffic. For a more subjective reading, SITCH
interrogates a GSM radio to determine the BTSes it prefers to associate
with, which takes into account more than just signal strength.
</p><p>
The use of a GSM radio can get results in seconds, which is far better
than waiting the seven minutes required for the SDR scan, and with more
detailed information than you get using Kalibrate. Where SITCH's SDR
approach is lacking is in producing information you can use to identify
a specific provider's network, like the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and
Mobile Network Code (MNC), which are used to identify a specific cellular
network service provider. The information provided by the GSM radio
goes even further by providing MCC and MNC along with Location Area Code
(LAC) and CellID (CID), and when these network identifiers are combined
(MCC+MNC+LAC+CID), you get the Cell Global ID (CGI). You never
should see the same CGI in two different locations.
</p><p>
The actual detection process happens in two stages. The first part
occurs within the SITCH sensor itself. The information gathered is
compared against two data feeds. One feed is derived from the FCC
license database, which tells what frequencies are licensed to each
provider and the geo-location of the tower permitted to operate on
that frequency. The second data feed is the OpenCellID database
(<a href="http://opencellid.org" target="_self">opencellid.org</a>).
This is a crowd-sourced feed of observed BTSes. Using these two feeds
with the information you collect, you can determine the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Is the observed ARFCN licensed to operate in this area? (ARFCN comes from both SDR
and GSM radio observations.)
</p></li><li><p>
Is the observation of this CGI in this area corroborated by the OpenCellID feed
(comparing GSM findings and OpenCellID database)?
</p></li><li><p>
Has there been a change in preferred BTS (tracking the GSM radio's preferred BTS)?
</p></li><li><p>
Has an ARFCN been observed over the site threshold I set (able to set a per-sensor
ARFCN power threshold)?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In addition to tracking cellular network information, functionality recently has
been added to detect GPS spoofing (<a href="http://www.rtl-sdr.com/spoofing-gps-locations-with-low-cost-tx-sdrs" target="_self">www.rtl-sdr.com/spoofing-gps-locations-with-low-cost-tx-sdrs</a>), using GeoIP and a GPS
dongle. GPS spoofing has a great potential for mischief, especially if
used to defeat geolocation-based phone unlocking like Google's Trusted
Places (<a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/how-add-trusted-place-android-50-lollipop" target="_self">www.androidcentral.com/how-add-trusted-place-android-50-lollipop</a>).
</p><p>
The second method of detection happens in the service side of SITCH.
I'm using a time-series database to track measurements over time, and I
can use this to find anomalies. This is especially useful for tracking
ARFCN power as reported by Kalibrate.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
SITCH System Details</b></span>
</p><p>
SITCH was designed so that once you have the back-end services set up,
it is as simple as plugging components into a Raspberry Pi 2, imaging and
installing an SD card, and providing power and connectivity to the device.
Device updates are managed by a service called Resin.io, so ideally,
you never have to touch the device again, except to decommission it.
No more SD card re-imaging to update the software&mdash;it's all delivered
automatically, to all of your sensors, within minutes of building the
new version of the software. All the telemetry information flows up
to the service (which you host with your favorite cloud provider).
Alerts generated by the system are delivered through Slack, and you 
optionally can forward the collected information to the log aggregation or
SIEM system of your choice, provided there's a Logstash output plugin
that will facilitate the information delivery for you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12104f1.large.jpg"><img src="12104f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. One code push to Resin causes all sensors to
update, hands-free.
</p></div></div><p>
The service side of the SITCH system is composed of a few components.
Resin.io is used for managing the device software and runtime variables.
Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK stack) is used for aggregation and
storage. Graphite and InfluxDB are interchangeable in the SITCH service.
However, testing uncovered the hazard of using Graphite/Whisper, which
allocates files for the entire lifecycle of a metric as soon as it's first
observed, in an environment where the metric namespace can rapidly expand.
Slack is used for alerting. Vault (<a href="https://www.vaultproject.io" target="_self">https://www.vaultproject.io</a>) is used for the secure distribution
of certificates and keys to sensors. Although it sounds like a lot to
manage, much of this has been containerized and automated to get you up
and running rapidly.

Figure 2. Kalibrate Scan Results Viewed in Elasticsearch
</p></div></div><p>
The SITCH sensor itself is based on the Raspberry Pi 2 platform.
SDR functionality is provided by a USB RTL-SDR device (<a href="http://www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-xtr-rtl2832u-e4000.html" target="_self">www.nooelec.com/store/sdr/sdr-receivers/nesdr-xtr-rtl2832u-e4000.html</a>). The GSM modem
used in testing is a SIM808, but the AT command set used for interacting
with the modem is general enough that many GSM modems will work.

</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Setting Up the SITCH Service</b></span>
</p><p>
Before getting started, a few caveats. This walk-through is going to
provide you with a demo-grade service. You're urged to consider using
Kubernetes, Mesos + Marathon, or another more resilient platform to
get the benefit of a more self-healing application. That being said,
the components are all containerized, so restarting pieces in the event
things get weird is trivial. For the sake of brevity, some common
administrative tasks are not covered in detail. You can find more documentation and
troubleshooting information at <a href="http://sitch.io" target="_self">sitch.io</a>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Instance Creation</b></span>
</p><p>
Create one Linux instance with at least 4GB of RAM and 8GB of disk space
on the root volume, and add a second volume with at least 40GB of space.
This demo relies on Docker, not any specific Linux distribution. Allocate
a static IP to the instance and give it a DNS name. Initially, you 
need only SSH access. Make sure that your instance is only reachable via SSH
from your current IP address. Once the instance is alive,
<tt  >ssh</tt> in, format
the 40GB volume with XFS, and mount the 40GB volume under /opt/shared.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Obtaining Certificates</b></span>
</p><p>
I use EFF's Certbot to obtain certificates for the web server portion
of the service (<a href="http://letsencrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html?highlight=docker#running-with-docker" target="_self">letsencrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html?highlight=docker#running-with-docker</a>). Open up TCP ports 443 and 80 for inbound access
so that the Let's Encrypt service can verify your control of your server's
DNS name. Next, run this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker run -it --rm \
-p 443:443 -p 80:80 \
--name certbot \
-v "/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt" \
-v "/var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt" \
quay.io/letsencrypt/letsencrypt:latest \
certonly
</pre>
</p><p>
This runs the certbot container image, which will walk you through the
process of obtaining a certificate for your environment. Close TCP
port 80. You won't need it again until you renew the certificates.
You also should consider only leaving TCP port 443 open to IPs where
your sensors will live.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Setting Up Your Own Vault</b></span>
</p><p>
I use Vault by Hashicorp to store the crypto material for securing
the sensor-to-service communication. Start up Vault, mounting in the
certificates created in the prior step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker run -d  \
--cap-add=IPC_LOCK \
-p 8200:8200  \
-v /etc/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt/ \
-e 'VAULT_LOCAL_CONFIG={"backend": {"file": {"path": 
 &#8618;"/vault/file"}},"listener":{"tcp":{"address":"0.0.0.0:8200"
&#8618;,"tls_cert_file": "/etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE/
&#8618;fullchain.pem","tls_key_file":"/etc/letsencrypt/live/
&#8618;YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE/privkey.pem"}},"default_lease_ttl": 
 &#8618;"7200h", "max_lease_ttl": "7200h"}' \
--name sitch_vault \
vault server
</pre>
</p><p>
Replace <tt  >YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE</tt> in the above command with the DNS name of
your server, which is the same name that you used in the Certbot wizard,
above. Running <tt  >docker ps</tt> should confirm that the vault service is
now up and running. Next, you need to unseal the vault and obtain a
root token.
</p><p>
To unseal the vault, start with this: <tt  >docker exec sitch_vault vault
init --tls-skip-verify</tt> You'll see something like Figure 3. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12104f3.large.jpg"><img src="12104f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Output from <tt >docker exec sitch_vault vault
init --tls-skip-verify</tt>
</p></div></div><p>
To unseal the vault, run this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker exec -it sitch_vault vault unseal --tls-skip-verify
</pre>
</p><p>
That will result in a prompt requesting a key. Copy/paste one from above.
Do this three times total, using a different unseal key each time, and
the vault will unseal. You should see output from the final command
that reads: <tt  >Sealed: false</tt>. Record your Initial Root Token in your
password manager.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Populating Vault with Keys</b></span>
</p><p>
Log delivery uses Filebeat and Logstash. These require certificates for
operation. Fortunately, the process for generating and uploading it has
been automated. First, you'll need to open TCP port 8200 from the world,
into your server. Next, you'll run the SITCH Self-Signed Seeder (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/self_signed_seeder" target="_self">https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/self_signed_seeder</a>):

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker run -it \
-e VAULT_URL=$VAULT_URL \
-e VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_TOKEN \
-e LS_CLIENTNAME=$LS_CLIENTNAME \
-e LS_SERVERNAME=$LS_SERVERNAME \
docker.io/sitch/self_signed_seeder
</pre>
</p><p>
This will cause the Vault to be populated with certs and keys for
sensor and service. Make sure that your <tt  >LS_SERVERNAME</tt> is set to the
same hostname as included in the <tt  >VAULT_URL</tt>, because these containers
are running on the same host. There are two tokens mentioned in the
(quite verbose) output at the end: Client token and Server token.
Look under each section and grab the token labeled client-token (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12104f4.large.jpg"><img src="12104f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Grabbing the Token
</p></div></div><p>
Your Vault is now seeded with self-signed certs and keys for Logstash.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Configuring Storage for Scans</b></span>
</p><p>
Set up the Elasticsearch and Kibana portions of the ELK stack in whatever
manner makes the most sense for your environment. If you're using
AWS, you can accelerate this by using the AWS ElasticSearch Service.
Use ElasticSearch version 2.3 or greater. Retain the URLs for accessing
Kibana and Elasticsearch.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Configuring Logstash for Ingestion</b></span>
</p><p>
Logstash is used for ingestion of telemetry from the sensors. There's a
SITCH spin of the Logstash container&mdash;follow the instructions in the
README (found at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/logstash" target="_self">https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/logstash</a>) to set your
environment variables for running the container. Before you complete this
step, you'll need access to Slack to create a webhook for notification.
<tt  >GRAPHITE_HOST</tt> is the name of your server, and
<tt  >GRAPHITE_PORT</tt> will be 2003.
The Graphite line protocol is used for delivering time-series information,
which is understood by InfluxDB. Finally, open port 5001 so that the
Filebeat log shipper can connect to Logstash.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Building the SITCH Data Feed</b></span>
</p><p>
Now let's build the SITCH feed, which is composed of the OpenCellID
database, enriched with information from the Twilio API and the FCC
license database. Locate your OpenCellID API key and your Twilio SID
and token for API access. Run the container according to the README
at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/feed_builder" target="_self">https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/feed_builder</a>. This job will take
quite a while to run. If your curiosity demands to see progress, run
<tt  >docker logs -f CONTAINER_NAME</tt> to see the feed builder's progress.
Don't stop it mid-job, or you may have to wait until tomorrow to
try again. The OpenCellID database can be retrieved only once daily,
per API key. So let it roll until it's done.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12104f5.large.jpg"><img src="12104f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Configuring the Time-Series Database</b></span>
</p><p>
Any time-series database that supports the Graphite line protocol
should work with SITCH. For the purposes of this demo, I'm using 
InfluxDB. Make sure that TCP ports 2003, 8083, 8086 and 1000
are accessible from the server itself, using its own public IP address.
Start InfluxDB with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker run -d \
--name sitch_influx \
-p 8083:8083 \
-p 8086:8086 \
-p 2003:2003 \
-e INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_ENABLED=true \
-v /opt/shared/influxdb:/var/lib/influxdb \
influxdb
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step in preparing the persistence layer is Chronograf. I'm using
Chronograf to visualize the information stored in InfluxDB. Start it
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
docker run -d \
-p 10000:10000 \
--name sitch_chronograf \
chronograf
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12104f6.large.jpg"><img src="12104f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Instructions for running the SITCH front-end web server container are
at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/web" target="_self">https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/web</a>. Follow the instructions there
and confirm that you can download https://YOUR_SERVER_NAME/310.csv.gz.
This will confirm that your feed is built and available for your sensors.
Now is a great time to make sure that the ports mapped in for the web
container are accessible to you, from your IP address. It's not an
awful idea to take it a step further and employ authentication in the
web container, or a VPN for accessing it, but that's outside the scope
of this demo.

Figure 7. SIM808 Module with USB Console Cable Attached

Clone the sensor repository locally with <tt  >git clone
https://github.com/sitch-io/sensor</tt>. Descend into the sensor/ directory
and add your Resin application as a remote Git repository using the
<tt  >git remote add...</tt> command in the upper-right corner of the screen
when viewing the Resin application page in your browser.
</p><p>
Push the sensor software to Resin with <tt  >git push resin master</tt>. You'll
notice that it attempts to build the sensor software before accepting
the push. After a few minutes, you will see an ASCII art unicorn in
your terminal. Within a couple minutes, the application will begin to
download to the sensor. Depending on the model of the GSM modem you're
using, you may need to locate and press the GSM modem's power button.
</p><p>
As the sensor is powering up, you'll see a lot of information scroll
by. Most important, you need to see that the device detector
has picked up your GPS and GSM modem. If you're not using a SIM808
module, the README for the sensor repository has instructions for
adding the proper init string so that your modem can be recognized
(<a href="https://github.com/sitch-io/sensor" target="_self">https://github.com/sitch-io/sensor</a>). 
</p><p>
As the system is currently configured, you should be able to
receive alerts in Slack based on alarms fired from within the
sensor itself. The higher-level correlation, for instance,
ARFCN power trends, can be accomplished by configuring Chronograf
(<a href="https://www.influxdata.com/get-started/visualizing-data-with-chronograf" target="_self">https://www.influxdata.com/get-started/visualizing-data-with-chronograf</a>)
and Kapacitor
(<a href="https://www.influxdata.com/get-started/configuring-alerts-with-kapacitor" target="_self">https://www.influxdata.com/get-started/configuring-alerts-with-kapacitor</a>)
to visualize and alert on the information stored in the InfluxDB
time-series database. Start with monitoring kal_power readings over time,
and go from there.

Postscript</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, this is where &ldquo;ease of use&rdquo; begins. In order to add another
sensor, you need to assemble only one, and install the Resin OS,
just like you did with the first one. Tweak your sensor metadata in
Resin if you need to. You'll likely want to change the
<tt  >site_name</tt>
environment variable to facilitate distinction between sensors in the
data you're amassing. Go ahead and turn up one at every office.
Just make sure you have the storage provisioned to support it. If you
need to integrate this with your log management system, use the image
found at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/logstash" target="_self">https://hub.docker.com/r/sitch/logstash</a> as a base,
and adapt the configuration to accommodate your log management system.
This is very much beta-grade software and feedback is greatly appreciated.

all of which are accessible via <a href="https://github.com/sitch-io" target="_self">https://github.com/sitch-io</a>.
