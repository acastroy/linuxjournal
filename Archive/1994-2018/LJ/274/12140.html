Make your accounts more secure with two-factor authentication!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102a580.0x1122358"></a></h2></div></div><p>

Last weekend my work phone suddenly stopped working. Not the phone
itself, but rather all service stopped. I first noticed (of course) due
to an inability to load any web pages. Then I tried calling someone and
realized my phone was disconnected. In fact, when someone tried to call
me, it said the line was no longer in service. It was Sunday, and my phone
is a company device, so I had to wait until Monday to get things sorted.

</p><p>
It turns out someone called in to Verizon claiming to be me. The individual
claimed his phone (my phone) had been stolen, and he wanted to
transfer service to another device. He had enough information about
me to pass whatever verification Verizon required, and if he'd been a
little smoother on the phone, he'd have likely gotten my number. It
turned out that the Verizon employee felt the call was suspicious and
disabled the account instead of transferring service. (I know that
only because the employee made a note on the account.) After a stressful day of
back and forth, the company I work for was able to get my phone turned
back on, and I still have the same phone number I've always had&mdash;thank
goodness.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin saw me tweet about my phone issues, and he immediately responded
that I should check my online accounts, especially those with two-factor
authentication. If other people <span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> been able to get my phone number, they
could use that as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of their identity and reset many of
my passwords.
It hadn't occurred to me just how much we depend on our cell-phone
companies for security, even on our personal bank accounts. That doesn't
mean two-factor authentication (2FA) isn't important, it just means we need to
consider our phones as a viable vector for attack. So in this article, I want to
talk about securing your online accounts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102a580.0x11226c8"></a>
Call Your Mobile Provider</h2></div></div><p>
Before I talk about securing online accounts, I urge you to contact
your cell-phone company. I use several providers myself, and after my
experience with the company phone, I realized just how important it
is to contact the provider and set up security. By default, your cell-phone
company might have a few security questions for you to answer. It
also might just ask for your date of birth in order to access account
information. It's important to call and ask what sort of security
you can add to the account to make sure a third party can't pretend to be
you. What that security looks like will be different for every company,
but really, call them. Anyone on Facebook can look up my birthday,
and if that's all you need to make changes to an account...well, yikes.
</p><p>
Once you're confident that your phone isn't easily compromised, it's time
to start looking at your online accounts. Not all businesses provide 
two-factor authentication, but more and more are adding the service every
day. Even if your banks, email accounts and Spotify stations don't have
extra layers of protection, having a good password is crucial.

My Name Is My Passport, Verify Me</h2></div></div><p>
I've written in the past about creating &ldquo;good&rdquo; passwords. Some of what I
recommended is valid, and some was shortsighted. I was in good company
with my shortsightedness, because tons of companies still require
&ldquo;complex&rdquo; passwords. The problem is, password complexity generates
passwords that are hard for humans to remember and easy for computers to
guess. The famous <span   class="emphasis"><em>xkcd</em></span> comic explains the problem much better than I can
(Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12140f1.large.jpg"><img src="12140f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This comic titled
&ldquo;Password Strength&rdquo; from
<span  class="emphasis"><em>xkcd</em></span> is so true it 
hurts (<a href="https://xkcd.com/936" target="_self">https://xkcd.com/936</a>).
</p></div></div><p>
(Note: Randall Munroe from <a href="http://xkcd.com" target="_self">xkcd.com</a> made it fairly clear that
occasionally reprinting his comics is okay as long as he is attributed. I'll
go so far as to say not only is his work awesome, but you should go buy
things from his store. Seriously, he's awesome.)
</p><p>
The problem with truly &ldquo;good&rdquo; passwords is that they rarely meet the
requirements for complexity that most websites demand. It seems like
companies are perfectly fine with an eight-character password, as long as
there's a capital letter, punctuation, a number and no common words.
Basically,
they demand we have crappy, hard-to-remember passwords. It's very
frustrating.
</p><p>
If you're not using a password manager that generates random passwords,
the best I can recommend is that you make your password as long
as possible. My method for making a password is to string together
words (like correcthorsebatterystaple, which I didn't even have to
look up, because I totally remembered it), and then add the weird
complexity requirements at the end. That still doesn't help with
password reuse, however, which is an even bigger problem than using
strong passwords. Again, Randall illustrates the problem perfectly at
<a href="https://xkcd.com/792" target="_self">https://xkcd.com/792</a>. (I'm just giving a link this time; I don't want to push
my luck.)
</p><p>
Basically, if you use the same password everywhere, if one system is
compromised, all your accounts are vulnerable. I addressed that problem
in my last article about setting up good passwords, but unfortunately,
any pattern you might use to create passwords can be figured out. Here's
what I mean. Let's say you use this pattern for generating passwords:

<pre     class="programlisting">
word1 word2 sitename word3 word4 complexity_junk
</pre>
</p><p>
On the surface, this seems brilliant. You can remember four words, have
a standard &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; ending for meeting dumb password requirements,
and you can add the name of the website in the middle. That means every
password will be different. The problem is, it's still a pattern. Let's
say an attacker discovers that your Facebook password is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hampergranitefacebookcoffeeostrich53BLT!
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a nice, long, unique password. The problem is, now the attacker
knows your Amazon
password is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hampergraniteamazoncoffeeostrich53BLT!
</pre>
</p><p>
Truly, the best method I know of is to have a password manager that will
store and potentially generate passwords for you. I prefer passwords
I don't have to copy/paste in order to use, so I usually generate long
passwords using words. That way, I can glance at the password and type it
out quickly. The point of this whole section is to make you think about
passwords. Consider passwords that are truly strong, but also remember
that it's extremely important not to reuse passwords on multiple sites.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102a580.0x11231c8"></a>
Adding Another Factor</h2></div></div><p>
Two-factor authentication comes in many flavors. For cell phones, the trend is to use
fingerprints. Granted, fingerprints aren't the most secure authentication
method, but when used in addition to passwords, it does add significant
security. (I once heard Kyle Rankin say fingerprints are terrible
passwords, because you can change your &ldquo;password&rdquo; only ten times, and
you leave them written everywhere you touch.)
</p><p>
The cell-phone number itself is one of the most common forms of 2FA. Like
my original example demonstrated, many websites utilize SMS messages sent
to a phone number as verification of identity. There are many issues
with an SMS being the sole form of authentication, but as a required
second factor, it's not bad. What I mean by that is, many companies allow
you to use your cell phone for 2FA, but they also allow you to
recover your password by simply proving who you are by entering a code
sent via SMS. That completely eliminates the security of 2FA!
</p><p>
My personal favorite 2FA method is provided by Google. The implementation
is fairly robust, and in function, it's very easy to use. Basically,
you authenticate your phone, and rather than having a code texted to
you, which you have to type into a web form, the Google authenticator
just pops up on your phone asking if you're currently trying to log
in (with information on where you're trying). You simply click
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;,
and the 2FA is successful. I like it not only for simplicity, but also
because my phone number being hijacked doesn't automatically give the
thief the ability to provide 2FA.
</p><p>
There certainly are other methods for attaining multiple authentication
factors. Yubi is a company that has provided hardware-based USB
authentication for years. The problem I usually have is not everywhere
supports multiple forms of 2FA. However, if a website allows you to log
in with your Google account, Google handles the 2FA, thus securing the
site without any custom-2FA code on the particular site at all.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102a580.0x11234e0"></a>
If You Use Google, Beef It Up</h2></div></div><p>
Part of me dislikes recommending Google as your go-to source for 2FA.
Google is a commercial company, and using its
proprietary system as a form of authentication is a little unsettling. But
here's the deal: I'd rather everyone trust the integrity of Google than
trust the integrity of random hackers on the internet. Google's 2FA
is easy to set up, has proven to be reliable, and at the very least, it's
better than not using 2FA at all. So if you're interested in continuing
down the Google rabbit hole, I highly recommend you go through its
security wizards to make sure your account is yours.
</p><p>
Head over to <a href="https://accounts.google.com" target="_self">https://accounts.google.com</a> (Figure 2). On the
left,
you'll see sign in and security options. This page is also where you
can configure your privacy settings and recent activity. But for this
article, I'm focusing on the sign-in and security page. Figure 3
shows when your password was last changed, whether or not 2FA (Google calls
it two-step verification) is turned on, and whether you have any
app passwords. You also can set up your account recovery information on
this page, providing alternate email, phone number and secret questions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12140f2.large.jpg"><img src="12140f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Follow all these links. The checkups are very useful, and it's
better to over-prepare than under-prepare.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12140f3.large.jpg"><img src="12140f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Please turn on 2FA. It's painless and so much more
secure than a password alone.
</p></div></div><p>
When you turn on 2-step verification (Figure 4), you're able to configure
multiple 2FA options and set a default. I use the Google Prompt
(described previously) as my default method, but I also have my phone number
as an option. Plus, Google allows you to configure a number of alternates
like a USB hardware key, printable offline codes and an authenticator
app that will generate 2FA codes even while your phone is offline. Truly,
it's the variety of options that makes me love Google for my 2FA needs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12140f4.large.jpg"><img src="12140f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Google's 2FA is really well done.
</p></div></div><p>
Ultimately, I urge you to set up 2FA on as many
sites as support it. Most sites still require you to use SMS as the second
factor, so be sure your phone number is secure (remember to contact your
cell-phone provider). If websites support Google for 2FA instead of SMS,
I personally recommend it. It's simpler, and that means you're actually more likely
to use it. But whatever method you choose, 2FA is a good thing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x102a580.0x1123c70"></a>
Password Management</h2></div></div><p>
I use a password manager. I've used several through the years, but I do find
having a secure database of passwords is helpful. If I'm being completely
honest, none of the password managers I've tried are perfect. It's often
cumbersome to get the password (especially hard-to-type passwords) from
the manager to the website where you need it. Plus, going between desktops
and mobile devices is always a challenge. I use LastPass, but it's not a
perfect solution, and it's not free for mobile devices. There are
open-source password management tools like KeePass, Padlock and Passbolt,
but I've yet to find the perfect solution. If you have a password
management system that works across platforms and devices in a convenient,
yet secure way, please let me know. I'd love to write about it.
</p><p>
So, the moral of the story is to make sure your phone is secure,
and then make sure your accounts are secure too&mdash;preferably with multiple
factors of authentication. At the absolute least, please don't use the
same password for multiple websites!
