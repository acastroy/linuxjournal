<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #274, February 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>John Stultz</b></span> wanted to allow specially privileged processes to migrate
other processes between <span   class="bold"><b>cgroup</b></span>
namespaces&mdash;essentially migrating
processes from one virtual machine to another. This is risky, because
one of the whole points of cgroups is to isolate a virtual system and
prevent any potentially hostile processes within it from escaping.

</p><p>
John's patch, based on ideas from <span   class="bold"><b>Michael
Kerrisk</b></span>, would allow this
process migration if the controlling process had been granted
<span   class="bold"><b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b></span> capabilities.
</p><p>
John explained that this originally had been an <span   class="bold"><b>Android</b></span> feature
created so that people wouldn't have to run their activity manager
process with root privileges. John felt his approach was cleaner and
more generic.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kees Cook</b></span> liked the patch, but <span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span> saw trouble up ahead.
He explained:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Developments are afoot to make cgroups do more than
resource control. For example, there's Landlock and there's Daniel's
ingress/egress filter thing. Current cgroup controllers can mostly
just DoS their controlled processes. These new controllers (or
controller-like things) can exfiltrate data and change semantics.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexei Starovoitov</b></span> asked if Andy knew a better approach, but Andy said
he did not. He was only able to identify the problem, but had no
solution to offer. He did, however, identify some constraints that any
potential solution would need to adhere to. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
1. An insufficiently privileged process should not be able to move a
victim into a dangerous cgroup.
</p><p>
2. An insufficiently privileged process should not be able to move
itself into a dangerous cgroup and then use execve to gain privilege
such that the execve'd program can be compromised.
</p><p>
3. An insufficiently privileged process should not be able to make an
existing cgroup dangerous in a way that could compromise a victim in
that cgroup.
</p><p>
4. An insufficiently privileged process should not be able to make a
cgroup dangerous in a way that bypasses protections that would
otherwise protect execve() as used by itself or some other process in
that cgroup.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
John didn't know where to go with those admonitions, and the project
seemed to stall for a few weeks. Finally Andy suggested:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The cgroupfs interface is a bit unfortunate in that it doesn't really
express the constraints. To safely migrate a task, ISTM you ought to
have some form of privilege over the task <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> some form of privilege
over the cgroup. cgroupfs only handles the latter.
</p><p>
CAP_CGROUP_MIGRATE ought to be okay. Or maybe cgroupfs needs to gain
a concept of &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; cgroups and further restrict them and
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE should be fine for non-dangerous cgroups?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
But, <span   class="bold"><b>Tejun Heo</b></span> objected that if CAP_SYS_RESOURCE was disqualified due
to overlapping users, it would be better to use a different
capability altogether. He suggested:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We can't do it properly on
[cgroups] v1 because some controllers aren't properly hierarchical and
delegation model isn't well defined. For example, nothing prevents a process
from being pulled across different subtrees with the same delegation,
but v2 can do it properly. All that's necessary is to make the CAP
test OR'd to other perm checks instead of AND'ing so that the CAP just
allows overriding restrictions expressed through delegation but it's
normally possible to move processes around in one's own delegated
subtree.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Tejun went on to explain:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Delegation is an explicit operation and
reflected in the ownership of the subdirectories and cgroup interface
files in them. The subhierarchy containment is achieved by requiring
the user who's trying to migrate a process to have write perm on
cgroup.procs on the common ancestor of the source and target in
addition to the target.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In other words, it's a completely different approach from the one initially
proposed by John.
</p><p>
The discussion ended inconclusively, with the main question remaining
whether to use an existing capability or write a new one.
</p><p>
Typically, cgroup features are insane. There are often security issues
affecting virtual systems that wouldn't affect the outer running
system, forcing Linux to offer only a weird special-cased subset of
normal features. And there are also bizarre use cases surrounding
various feature enhancements, in which developers want to add
functionality to cgroups that would not be desirable in regular Linux.
It's all very here-be-dragons and full of magic. Migrating processes
between virtual systems will probably be a lot like that.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Serge E. Hallyn</b></span> pointed out a security
issue with cgroups. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Root in a user [namespace] cannot be trusted to write a traditional
security.capability xattr. If it were allowed to do so, then any
unprivileged user on the host could map his own uid to root in a
namespace, write the xattr, and execute the file with privilege on the
host.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The problem was that in the outer system, a user might legitimately do
something like that, while on a virtualized system, it was a security
hole.
</p><p>
Serge posted a patch to do crazy madness in order to simulate proper
behavior on the virtual machine. The patch, he said, &ldquo;allows a simple
setxattr to work, allows tar/untar to work, and allows us to tar in
one namespace and untar in another while preserving the capability,
without risking leaking privilege into a parent namespace.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He explained:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When a task in a user ns (which is privileged with CAP_SETFCAP toward
that user_ns) asks to write v2 security.capability, the kernel will
transparently rewrite the xattr as a v3 with the appropriate rootid.
Subsequently, any task executing the file that has the noted kuid as
its root uid, or which is in a descendant user_ns of such a user_ns,
will run the file with capabilities.
</p><p>
If a task writes a v3 security.capability, then it can provide a uid
(valid within its own user namespace, over which it has CAP_SETFCAP)
for the xattr. The kernel will translate that to the absolute uid
and write that to disk. After this, a task in the writer's namespace
will not be able to use those capabilities, but a task in a namespace
where the given uid is root will.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric W. Biederman</b></span> gave a quick look and said the patch seemed strange
but correct. He said he'd go over it thoroughly and report back.
Meanwhile, Michael Kerrisk asked for some documentation, perhaps in the
man pages for <span   class="bold"><b>user_namespaces(7)</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>capabilities(7)</b></span>, and Serge wrote
some up.

I don't very often play games. I know that seems odd, because I do often write
about gaming. Honestly though, I very rarely actually take the time to 
play video games. Recently, however, there has been an exception to that rule.

</p><p>
One of my favorite online comics is <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Oatmeal</em></span>. The
creator collaborated with
another guy and came up with an incredibly fun card game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploding
Kittens</em></span>. I love the game. My teenage daughters love the game. Heck,
I've even purchased another box so my college-aged daughter could play
it with her roommates. Not only is the card game fun, but they also made a
video game version that was on iOS-only for a long time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12139androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Well, no more. Now you can get <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploding Kittens</em></span> for
$1.99 at the
Google Play store. It supports playing with random weirdos on the
internet (I could be one of those weirdos) and playing with a group of
friends. I won't describe the game itself other than to say it's silly,
hilarious and fun. Plus, there are lots of awesome graphics drawn by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Oatmeal</em></span>. In fact, this game is so much fun for such a reasonable price,
I'm giving it this month's Editors' Choice award even though it's not
open source. Because truly, it's an incredibly fun game that you can
play in five minutes while you're doing whatever you might be doing that
would facilitate five minutes of quiet time on your cell phone.
</p><p>
Search for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exploding Kittens</em></span> at the Google Play store, and start playing now!

I hate it when I paste something into a window, only to realize I'd copied
something new into the clipboard. I usually end up with eight paragraphs
pasted into a login box. To quote my college-aged daughter, the struggle
is real.

</p><p>
Thankfully, it's easy to integrate a clipboard manager into OS X. 
Several options are available, but my favorite happens to be open source. If
you head over to <a href="https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut" target="_self">https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut</a>, you'll
find Flycut,
which is a clipboard manager that quietly records all your clippings
and allows you to paste whichever one you want at any given time. By
default, if you want to use Flycut instead of the system clipboard, you
press Command-Shift-V instead of just Command-V. A screen overlay
lets you scroll through previous clippings, and you double-click on the
one you want to paste.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="12139fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Flycut is a very simple tool, but all the best ones usually are. If you've
ever accidentally overwritten your clipboard, you owe it to yourself to
download Flycut either from the GitHub page or the Mac App store.

<h2 class="title">Gabedit: the Portal to Chemistry</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #274, February 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Many chemistry software applications are available 
for doing scientific work on Linux. I've covered several here in previous
issues of the magazine, and of them have their own peculiar
specialties&mdash;areas where one may work better than another. So, depending on what your
research entails, you may need to use multiple software packages to handle
all of the work. This is where Gabedit will step in to help you out. 

</p><p>
Gabedit
provides a single unified interface to a multitude of chemistry packages
available on your system. It should be available within the package
management systems for most distributions. For example, on Debian-based
systems, you can install it with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install gabedit
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it's installed, start it with the 
<tt  >gabedit</tt> command. The very first time you start Gabedit,
you'll see a series of windows describing all
the data directories that need to be created in order for Gabedit
to run. The pane on the left-hand side shows a listing of all the
chemistry programs you could use for your work. The central pane
provides two tabs, one for input and one for results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf1.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start Gabedit, you'll get an empty
project where you can begin your work.
</p></div></div><p>
To start working with Gabedit, you need to create a new input file for
the software package you want to work with. The icon bar across the
top of the window provide buttons for the various types of input files
that Gabedit can use. Clicking on one of them will pop up a new
window where you can enter parameters relevant for that type of input
file. For example, clicking on the first button pops up a window where you
can create a new input file for GAMESS. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf2.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. When you create a new input file, a new window pops up where you
can enter the initial parameters.
</p></div></div><p>
If you try to do
this at the beginning of your work, you'll actually get an error. All
of these programs depend on some set of atoms, defined as a geometry,
in order to do their calculations, which means you need to
create this geometry first. Clicking the Geometry menu entry will
provide a list of different options for creating a new geometry. The
first two are specialized options for Gaussian and Molpro. For this example,
let's use the two options at the bottom of the list. The first
option pops up a new window where you can select the type of geometry
(XYZ, for example) and then create a table of atoms used within your
geometry.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf3.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You need to create a new geometry that will be used in the
calculations.
</p></div></div><p>
Right-clicking inside the table of the geometry
editor provides a pop-up menu where you can add a new entry to the
table. This allows you to select the element, location and charge for the
new point in the geometry. This geometry exists within the
memory space of the current project, which means it will be available
for other functions within Gabedit. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12139gabf4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can add individual elements, setting their chemical
properties, to your geometry.
</p></div></div><p>
The other available geometry function is
the draw function. You can access it via the
Geometry&rarr;Draw menu item. This pops up a new window where you can visualize your
molecule and manipulate it before doing any calculations. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf5.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can use the draw functionality to visualize the geometry of
your collection of atoms.
</p></div></div><p>
Here, you can edit the existing geometry and move elements around, or
you can add or remove elements to the molecule. You even can add entire
functional units, such as benzene rings or alcohol groups.
</p><p>
Once you have an input file, you need to run it through the appropriate
software package in order to get results. If the programs you wish to
use are installed on your local machine and are in your search path,
it should just work out of the box. If they were installed in some other
location, you need to tell Gabedit where they are. Clicking the 
Settings&rarr;Preferences menu item will bring up a new window where you can
set the commands needed to run the relevant programs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf6.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can set the specific commands for each of the available
chemistry packages.
</p></div></div><p>
You then can run the program either by clicking the run button in the
icon bar or clicking the Run&rarr;Run a Computation Chemistry
program menu item. This will present a new window where you can set the parameters
for this run.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf7.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can set the parameters for either a local run or a remote
run within the same window.
</p></div></div><p>
For a local run, you can set parameters including
which program to use, what folder to run in and the filenames
and commands to execute. If you select &ldquo;Remote host&rdquo; instead, you can
choose the protocol to communicate over and which host to communicate
with. You also can set the user name and password to use, along with the
working directory on the remote machine. If you find that your initial
choice of program isn't optimal, you can try another. By clicking the
Tools&rarr;Open Babel menu item, you get a window that allows you to do
a translation of input file from one file format to another. This way,
you can reuse your previous work within a different software package.
</p><p>
Gabedit is not only useful in setting up a computational chemistry
problem and running it, but it's also useful in analyzing the results
afterward. The analysis functions are available under the Tools menu
item. You can select to load a file for a basic XY-plot, and you can select
the Tools&rarr;XY plotter menu item to bring up the plot window. Right-clicking the plot window brings up a menu where you can change the
options of the plot as well as load data files to be plotted. 
There
also is an option to do contour plots by clicking the
Tools&rarr;Contours plotter menu item. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf8.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. You can do contour plots of the results from a computation.
</p></div></div><p>
Additionally, there is a whole series
of spectrum analyses that you can apply as well. You can do IR, Rahman, UV
and ECD spectral analysis. For each of these options in the Tools menu,
you can load an output file from a number of different file formats,
including a special Gabedit file format. 
</p><p>
Under the NMR spectrum
entry of the Tools menu, you can select to load either a previously
calculated results file or the NMR Spin-Spin Splitting
Simulation. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139gabf9.large.jpg"><img src="12139gabf9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You can do NMR spectrum simulations for your molecule of choice.
</p></div></div><p>
Here you can set several options, such as the
lineshape and the scaling. If you right-click the plot window, you have
the same options as in the other plot windows. You also can add more data sets,
change the plot details or the overall color theme.
</p><p>
With Gabedit, you can use quite a few of the available chemistry packages
from a unified user interface. When doing more complicated research,
or doing discovery work, being able to use multiple packages 
definitely will make everything easier to handle. 
You also can expand the options within
Gabedit by adding your own functional units or altering the molecular
mechanics parameters to be used in your work. Hopefully, Gabedit can help
move your research into new areas.

<h2 class="title">Get a Haircut, Get a Real Job</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #274, February 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'm often asked about what the latest trends in IT will mean for job
hunters. It's interesting for me, because although I haven't actively looked
for a job in years, I do create training that helps people get hired
every day. So, I figured a few tips for the current job market would be a
great way for me to answer lots of emails in one fell swoop. Here it goes.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
1) DevOps is no longer magic.</b></span>
</p><p>
For the past two years, if you could put &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; on your
r&eacute;sum&eacute;, you'd
pretty much get hired on principle alone. Lately, DevOps has become
a ubiquitous part of IT, and it isn't the special snowflake it used to
be. Don't get me wrong; you still need to have DevOps skills on your
r&eacute;sum&eacute;&mdash;just know that it won't get you hired on its own. Instead, mention
what sorts of things you have done or can do utilizing DevOps.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
2) Security is vital.</b></span>
</p><p>
If you love security, the future looks bright for you. But even
if specializing in security isn't what you want to do as a career,
it's important to approach every aspect of technology with a security
mindset. Twenty years ago, we worried about firewalls, but rarely considered
attacks coming from inside our own networks. That was a poor attitude
20 years ago, and now it's technology suicide. Security isn't something
you add, it's a way you plan.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
3) Developers, developers, developers.</b></span>
</p><p>
Steve Ballmer may have seemed like a crazy man when he shouted it on
stage back in 2000, but now that DevOps is a part of everything we do,
developer skills are as important as ever. Even the traditional system
administrator or operations person will need to have at least rudimentary
programming skills in order to function in our DevOps world. Plus,
here's a secret: programming is actually kind of fun, especially when it
can save you time on the job!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
4) Don't forget your roots.</b></span>
</p><p>
In the Pixar movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>WALL-E</em></span>, civilization has advanced to the point that
everything is automated. It means life for people is extremely easy, but
it also means they don't know how to do anything for themselves. With
everything in the data center and the cloud being automated, it's easy
to hire an entire team that knows nothing about the actual processes
they're automating. That works great&mdash;until it doesn't. Make sure you're
well versed in the underlying systems (almost always Linux), so when
something goes wrong, you know how to fix it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
5) Be a softy!</b></span>
</p><p>
Soft skills (communication skills, cooperation skills and so on) are something
we all too often overlook in IT. But not only do soft skills help you in
the interviewing process, they also help you in the current IT landscape
where various disciplines are working closer than ever. Again, DevOps is
much to blame for this blurring of department lines. Any employee who is
able to communicate cross-discipline, especially one who is able to communicate
with non-IT folks, is going to be invaluable to any organization. Take
some communication classes. You might be the only nerd in the room,
but you'll also likely have the best job opportunities!

<h2 class="title">Getting Sticky with It</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #274, February 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Although they might not be so good for credit cards or floppy disks, magnets
are one of those things that always have fascinated me. For the past
few years, I've wanted to get a set of the round Zen Magnets to play
with&mdash;they're sort of like an extra science-y version of LEGOs. Unfortunately,
before I was able to purchase any, the US government banned their sale!

</p><p>
Recently, the folks at Zen Magnets won their long legal battle
and are able to sell tiny, strong magnets again. The regular-size
Zen Magnets aren't available yet, but thankfully, production once again
can begin. In the meantime, I was able to order &ldquo;micromagnets&rdquo; from the same
company. They work just like Zen Magnets, but are tinier. I decided
to order a couple sets, because I'm impatient and also to support the
company who fought the battle allowing magnets to be sold in
the US once again.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12139magnetsf1.large.jpg"><img src="12139magnetsf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
These are what I made last night with my new micromagnets. I can
hardly wait for the full-size ones!
</p></div></div><p>
To read about the legal battle, check out the blog here:
<a href="http://zenmagnets.com/magnet-ban-cleared-game-on" target="_self">zenmagnets.com/magnet-ban-cleared-game-on</a>. And while you're there,
feel free to pre-order some Zen Magnets. I sure did!
