Nventify's Imagizer Cloud Engine</h2></div></div><p>

Organizations that rely on compelling imagery to help clients make
informed decisions face challenges presenting it appropriately across
devices. To assist, Nventify launched Imagizer Cloud Engine, a new
cloud-based image manipulation platform that removes the complexities of
dynamically delivering best-sized images to end users. The new platform
enables customers to deploy image transformation services for
their products in five minutes or less. Key features of the platform include
dynamically responsive image adjustment based on screen layout, automatic
format selection (such as WebP) by detecting browser and device types,
reduction of image storage due to transcoding of master images on the fly
and client-side SDKs. Libraries for the latter include compatibility with
popular languages, such as JavaScript, Java, PHP, Ruby, Python and Swift.

Server Technology's HDOT Alt-Phase Switched POPS PDU</h2></div></div><p>
Server Technology says that although the engineering challenge was
significant&mdash;adding per outlet power measurement into its popular
High-Density Outlet Technology (HDOT) power distribution unit (PDU)
family&mdash;product quality and manufacturability were not sacrificed. The new HDOT
Switched POPS (Per Outlet Power Sensing) PDU, bolstered by the addition
of device-level monitoring, is the new ultimate solution for density,
capacity planning and remote power management for the modern data center,
states Server Technology. At each outlet, the novel POPS technology
provides +/&ndash;1% billable-grade accuracy for energy consumption for
typical data-center equipment loads as well as current, voltage, active
power, apparent power, power factor and crest factor. POPS complements
the existing HDOT concept, &ldquo;the smallest form factor PDU&rdquo; that
significantly increases real estate in the back of the rack by fitting
as many as 42 C13s in a 42U-high network-managed PDU device. Finally,
Alternating Phase outlets in Server Technology's PDUs distribute phases
on a per receptacle basis, resulting in better load balancing and cable
management.

IGEL Universal Desktop Converter</h2></div></div><p>
IGEL Technology's next-generation Universal Desktop Converter 3
(UDC3) is a powerful and universally deployable managed thin-client
solution, a low-cost alternative to desktop hardware solutions. UDC3
allows businesses to reduce their desktop replacement
costs dramatically, eliminating the need to invest in new hardware to support their
virtualized infrastructures. Converting PCs, laptops and thin clients from
other manufacturers into IGEL Linux 10 OS-based thin clients also enables
IT organizations to administer all of their endpoint devices
from a centralized management console securely. The IGEL UDC3 can be installed as
the operating system on any device having an x86-based 64-bit processor,
2GB of RAM and 2GB of storage. Using the IGEL UDC3 on these end-user
computing devices converts them into an IGEL thin client running the
IGEL Linux 10 OS. The updated IGEL Linux 10 OS now features support for
the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) to extend the IGEL's
UDC3 target platforms to the latest end-user devices including many
laptop computers and desktop PCs, thin clients and compute sticks. Plus,
with its enhanced 64-bit OS compatibility, the new version can address
more than 4GB of RAM in next-generation devices.

Natalie Rusk's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scratch Coding Cards</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
The phrase &ldquo;Learn to Program One Card at a Time&rdquo; plays the role
of subtitle and friendly invitation from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scratch Coding
Cards</em></span>, a
colorful collection of activities that introduce children to creative
coding. Developed by Natalie Rusk, research scientist in the Lifelong
Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab, the resource consists of
illustrated activity cards that provide a playful entry point into
Scratch, the graphical programming language used by millions of children
around the world. The cards make it easy for kids to learn how to
create a variety of interactive projects, such as a racing game, an
animated interactive story, a virtual pet and much more. Each card
features step-by-step instructions for beginners to start coding. The
front of the card shows an activity kids can do with Scratch, such as
animating a character or keeping score in a game. The back shows how to
snap together blocks of code to make the projects come to life. Along the
way, kids learn key coding concepts, such as sequencing, conditionals and
variables. Publisher No Starch Press recommends the coding activity
cards for sharing among small groups in homes, schools and after-school
programs.

SSH Communications Security's Universal SSH Key Manager</h2></div></div><p>
Today's IAM solutions, warns enterprise cybersecurity expert SSH
Communications Security, fail to address fully the requirements of
trusted access. Organizations lack an efficient way to manage and govern
trusted access credentials and have no visibility into the activities
that occur within the secure channels that are created for trusted access
operations. Leading the charge to fix the issue once and for all,
SSH Communications Security announced significant enhancements to its
Universal SSH Key Manager (UKM) solution. UKM helps organizations
more effectively manage SSH user key-based and encrypted access,
control privileged access and enforce defined compliance policies. In
addition, UKM helps customers discover, monitor, lockdown, remediate
and automate the lifecycle of SSH user key-based access for interactive
and machine-to-machine trusts without disrupting existing processes
or the need to deploy agents. Updates include application-level policy
management, status and compliance reporting and a new SSH Risk Assessment
Tool.
