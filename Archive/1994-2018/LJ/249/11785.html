<tt  >find|xargs</tt>: the magic of smart pipes versus
filenames with spaces.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc49580.0xd41408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I dug into the weird but powerful <tt  >find</tt> command, a
tool that I find to be an essential part of working with the command line on
a Linux system, and as a key tool for shell scripts too. Although it's super
powerful, <tt  >find</tt> has some odd quirks and does a really poor job
with filenames that have spaces.
</p><p>
Indeed, in the good-old days, UNIX was developed with a standard rule of
&ldquo;no spaces in filenames&rdquo;, so it's only recently with the
addition of far longer filename options that spaces have shown up to plague
us Linux users. The problem, of course, is that the standard field
separator in the shell is, you guessed it, the space. So if you have a file
called &ldquo;My Latest Story&rdquo;, just about every command is going to
hiccup. 
</p><p>
Try this, and it'll fail:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat My Latest Story
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc49580.0xd41828"></a></h2></div></div><p>
saying that file &ldquo;My&rdquo;, file &ldquo;Latest&rdquo; and file
&ldquo;Story&rdquo; are not found. 
</p><p>
Savvy command-line users have long since learned that filename completion
is the easiest solution to this, typing in the fragment <tt  >cat
My</tt>
then pressing &lt;Tab&gt; to have it completed:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat My\ Latest\ Story
</pre>
</p><p>
Aesthetically yechy, but it's functional. You also can quote filenames, of
course, so this also would work:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat "My Latest Story"
</pre>
</p><p>
But, again, it's a hassle. The real solution simply is never to use spaces in
Linux filenames, but as a shell script writer, you can't guarantee that
your script users meet the same criteria, so you've got to cope.
And, that's where <tt  >find</tt> tends to fall down.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc49580.0xd41cf8"></a>
Mutual Incompatibility: <tt  >find</tt> and Spaces</h2></div></div><p>
There's a rather kludgy solution that's now part of the complicated
<tt  >find</tt> language, fortunately, and it's just a simple variant on
the basic <tt  >-print</tt> predicate:
<tt  >-print0</tt>.
</p><p>
Run it by itself, however, and you'll get really odd output, because for
every matching filename, <tt  >find</tt> ends the filename with an ASCII 0
rather than the usual end of line. Try it, you'll see the output is a bit
confusing!
</p><p>
To get this all to work with <tt  >find</tt>, the most common solution is to
pipe the output of <tt  >find</tt> into the
<tt  >xargs</tt> command and
specify the <tt  >-0</tt> flag:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -name "*.c" -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l
</pre>
</p><p>
The above snippet would work for source files with names like &ldquo;black
box 2.c&rdquo; and &ldquo;chapter 3 problem 8.c&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Let's start with just a simple <tt  >find</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -name "*.c"
./black box 2.c
./chapter 3 problem 8.c
./helloworld.c
./sample.c
</pre>
</p><p>
Add the <tt  >-print0</tt>, and the output is a bit wonky, as expected:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -name "*.c" -print0
./black box 2.c./chapter 3 problem 8.c./helloworld.c./sample.c$ 
</pre>
</p><p>
Messy. Worse, what if you use the <tt  >find</tt> command and forget to
compensate for those pesky space-filled filenames? Oh, it's not pretty:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -name "*.c" | xargs ls -l
ls: ./black: No such file or directory
ls: ./chapter: No such file or directory
ls: 2.c: No such file or directory
ls: 3: No such file or directory
ls: 8.c: No such file or directory
ls: box: No such file or directory
ls: problem: No such file or directory
-rw-r--r--  1 taylor  staff  0 Nov  5 14:39 ./helloworld.c
-rw-r--r--  1 taylor  staff  0 Nov  5 14:39 ./sample.c
</pre>
</p><p>
I warned you up front that spaces in filenames cause trouble, and
here's that trouble come to roost.
</p><p>
Add the <tt  >-print0</tt> instead of the assumed default of
<tt  >-print</tt>, pipe that directly to
<tt  >xargs</tt>, and now it all
makes sense:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -name "*.c" -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 taylor  staff  0 Nov  5 14:39 ./black box 2.c
-rw-r--r--  1 taylor  staff  0 Nov  5 14:39 ./chapter 3 problem 8.c
-rw-r--r--  1 taylor  staff  0 Nov  5 14:39 ./helloworld.c
-rw-r--r--  1 taylor  staff  0 Nov  5 14:39 ./sample.c
</pre>
</p><p>
I've written about dealing with spaces in filenames within shell
scripts in the past. It's a pain. Now at least with
<tt  >find</tt>, you
now know how to work in a space-friendly way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc49580.0xd42a08"></a>
A Bit More about <tt  >xargs</tt></h2></div></div><p>
Before moving on to the dynamic duo of <tt  >find</tt> and
<tt  >xargs</tt>, however, let's
spend a time bit more time on <tt  >xargs</tt> itself. The
<tt  >xargs</tt> command is designed
to let you invoke another command with arguments received in a
pipe.
</p><p>
Commonly, you'll see <tt  >find|xargs</tt>, but it turns out you can do other
things with it too, as you'll see.
</p><p>
More important, remember that the first argument given to
<tt  >xargs</tt> itself is
the command you want to run. A common usage might be something like this:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
xargs grep -i "pattern"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc49580.0xd39710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
as part of a pipeline.
</p><p>
Where <tt  >xargs</tt> really shines though is with its many
command-line arguments.
One of the most useful of those is <tt  >-n</tt>, which lets
you specify the maximum
number of entries it should accumulate before running the specified
command. If you've ever seen a &ldquo;stack overflow&rdquo; or &ldquo;buffer
overflow&rdquo; on the command line, you'll appreciate the
<tt  >-n</tt>
flag. Here's a simple example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo this is a demo of the xargs -n flag | xargs -n3
this is a
demo of the
xargs -n flag
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the <tt  >-n</tt> flag causes
<tt  >xargs</tt> to push out its buffer every n
items&mdash;darn useful with really big directories!
</p><p>
Even more useful is the <tt  >-p</tt> option that has
<tt  >xargs</tt> prompt you to
proceed with the given command. Want to remove some files, but not others?
Try this (carefully):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -p rm -rf
rm -rf .?...n
rm -rf ./black box 2.c?...n
rm -rf ./chapter 3 problem 8.c?...y
rm -rf ./helloworld.c?...n
rm -rf ./sample.c?...n
</pre>
</p><p>
In this sequence, <tt  >xargs</tt> prompts with the <tt  >?...</tt> sequence (confusing
though it is). Look carefully, and you'll see that &ldquo;chapter 3
problem 8.c&rdquo; is the only file I opted to delete. I also used
<tt  >-n1</tt> to ensure that I could decide on a file-by-file basis which
to delete.
</p><p>
Note that any of this works from within a shell script too, so if you had
one that, say, rotated log files and deleted the oldest of them, using
<tt  >find|xargs</tt> would result in users being prompted, log file by log file,
whether they want to delete the oldest or save them for historical
research.
</p><p>
One of the coolest things you can do with <tt  >find|xargs</tt>
is to tie <tt  >grep</tt>
into it. Here's a way to search all your *.php files for
<tt  >preg_replace()</tt>
invocations:


<pre     class="programlisting">
find / -name "*.c" -print0 | xargs -0 grep "preg_replace"
</pre>
</p><p>
Most C programmers aren't going to be using filenames with spaces in
them, so you might think the <tt  >-print0</tt> is unnecessary, but remember that
parent directories might well have spaces anyway. So it's just smart to
anticipate!
</p><p>
That's it for my tour of <tt  >find</tt> and
<tt  >xargs</tt>. In my next article, I'll be back
to shell script programming and will explore how to write an acey-deucey
game. Yes, back to card games. See you then!
