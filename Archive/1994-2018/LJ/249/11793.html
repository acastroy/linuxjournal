<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #249, January 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Drysdale</b></span> wanted to add <span   class="bold"><b>Capsicum</b></span> security features to Linux
after he noticed that <span   class="bold"><b>FreeBSD</b></span> already had Capsicum support. Capsicum
defines fine-grained security privileges, not unlike filesystem
capabilities. But as David discovered, Capsicum also has some
controversy surrounding it.
</p><p>
Capsicum has been around for a while and was described in a <span   class="bold"><b>USENIX</b></span>
paper in 2010:
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/papers/2010usenix-security-capsicum-website.pdf" target="_self">www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/papers/2010usenix-security-capsicum-website.pdf</a>.
</p><p>
Part of the controversy is just because of the similarity with
capabilities. As <span   class="bold"><b>Eric Biderman</b></span> pointed out during the discussion, it
would be possible to implement features approaching Capsicum's as an
extension of capabilities, but implementing Capsicum directly would
involve creating a whole new (and extensive) abstraction layer in
the kernel. Although David argued that capabilities couldn't actually be
extended far enough to match Capsicum's fine-grained security
controls.
</p><p>
Capsicum also was controversial within its own developer community.
For example, as Eric described, it lacked a specification for how to
revoke privileges. And, David pointed out that this was because the
community couldn't agree on how that could best be done. David quoted
an e-mail sent by <span   class="bold"><b>Ben Laurie</b></span> to the cl-capsicum-discuss mailing list in
2011, where Ben said, &ldquo;It would require additional book-keeping to
find and revoke outstanding capabilities, which requires knowing how
to reach capabilities, and then whether they are derived from the
capability being revoked. It also requires an authorization model for
revocation. The former two points mean additional overhead in terms of
data structure operations and synchronisation.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Given the ongoing controversy within the Capsicum developer community
and the corresponding lack of specification of key features, and given
the existence of capabilities that already perform a similar function
in the kernel and the invasiveness of Capsicum patches, Eric was
opposed to David implementing Capsicum in Linux.
</p><p>
But, given the fact that capabilities are much coarser-grained than
Capsicum's security features, to the point that capabilities can't
really be extended far enough to mimic Capsicum's features, and given
that FreeBSD already has Capsicum implemented in its kernel, showing
that it can be done and that people might want it, it seems there
will remain a lot of folks interested in getting Capsicum into the
Linux kernel.
</p><p>
Sometimes it's unclear whether there's a bug in the code or just a
bug in the written specification. <span   class="bold"><b>Henrique de Moraes
Holschuh</b></span> noticed
that the <span   class="bold"><b>Intel Software Developer Manual</b></span>
(vol. 3A, section 9.11.6) said
quite clearly that <span   class="bold"><b>microcode</b></span> updates required 16-byte alignment for
the <span   class="bold"><b>P6 family of CPUs</b></span>, the <span   class="bold"><b>Pentium 4</b></span> and the <span   class="bold"><b>Xeon</b></span>. But, the code in
the kernel's microcode driver didn't enforce that alignment.
</p><p>
In fact, Henrique's investigation uncovered the fact that some Intel
chips, like the Xeon X5550 and the second-generation <span   class="bold"><b>i5</b></span> chips, 
needed only 4-byte alignment in practice, and not 16. However, to conform
to the documented specification, he suggested fixing the kernel code
to match the spec.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Borislav Petkov</b></span> objected to this. He said Henrique was looking for
problems where there weren't any. He said that Henrique simply
had discovered a bug in Intel's documentation, because the alignment issue
clearly wasn't a problem in the real world. He suggested alerting the
Intel folks to the documentation problem and moving on. As he put it,
&ldquo;If the processor accepts the non-16-byte-aligned update, why do you
care?&rdquo;
</p><p>
But, as <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> remarked, the written spec was Intel's guarantee
that certain behaviors would work. If the kernel ignored the spec, it
could lead to subtle bugs later on. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Bill
Davidsen</b></span> said that if the
kernel ignored the alignment requirement, and &ldquo;if the requirement is
enforced in some future revision, and updates then fail in some insane
way, the vendor is justified in claiming 'I told you so'.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The end result was that Henrique sent in some patches to make the
microcode driver enforce the 16-byte alignment requirement.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Disney Everywhere, Even Android!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #249, January 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As a father of three girls, I have piles and piles of Disney DVDs and
Blu-rays. I occasionally look at the &ldquo;Digital Copy&rdquo; information and roll
my eyes, because it requires some odd Windows DRM software or some
other convoluted watching method that usually isn't possible or even
interesting for me.
</p><p>
Recently, however, Disney did a really cool thing and released an Android
app that allows you to stream any movie you have purchased from the
Google Play store, iTunes store or from a department store (assuming
the store copy came with that seemingly gimmicky digital version).
</p><p>
I tried it today, and sure enough, there was an insert in our <span   class="emphasis"><em>Saving
Mr. Banks</em></span> Blu-ray disk that allowed me to redeem a copy of the movie on my
Disney account. Now that movie is accessible to me through any Android app
along with any iOS app or even a Web browser (using Flash, unfortunately).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11793androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
If you install the app and connect it to your Google Play account, you'll
get a free copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wreck it Ralph</em></span>, even if you haven't
purchased any movies
in the past. 
</p><p>
Don't get me wrong, the movies still are completely
crippled with DRM, but at least they are accessible from a multitude of
devices. It's the first time the &ldquo;digital version&rdquo; of the movies hasn't
been a joke&mdash;at least in my world. If you have a collection of Disney
DVDs with unclaimed codes for digital copies, you can add them to your
account and stream the movies instantly. It's actually pretty cool!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Animation Made Easy</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #249, January 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you've ever wanted to make an animated film, the learning curve for such
software often is really steep. Thankfully, the Pencil program was released
and although basic, it provided a fairly simple way to create animations on
your computer (Windows, Mac or Linux) with open-source tools.
Unfortunately, the Pencil program was abandoned.
</p><p>
And really, that's the coolest part of open-source software. Building on
the incredible Pencil program, a new project was born. Pencil2D is under
active development, and it's a cross-platform application allowing for a
frame-by-frame animation sequence to be drawn and exported. Pencil2D
supports soundtracks, multiple layers, imported graphics and a really cool
onion-skin feature so that subsequent frames can be changed by increments
making for smooth animations.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11793fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The program isn't perfect, and it does crash from time to time. As you can see
in my screenshot, it enables a non-artist like myself to create animations.
(If I pressed play, you'd be shocked and amazed at my puffing chimney!)
Whether you want to make a quick animation or produce a full-length movie,
Pencil2D is a neat program that will cost you nothing to try. Download your
copy, and see how you can contribute to the project at

<h2 class="title">Designing with Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #249, January 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
3-D printers are becoming popular tools, dropping in price and becoming 
available to almost everyone. They can be used to build parts that you
can use around the house, but more and more, they also are being
used to create instruments for scientific work. Although a growing
library of objects are available in several on-line databases, there is
nearly an infinite number of possible things you might want to
build. This means you likely will want to design and build your
own creations. 
</p><p>
In this article, I take a look at FreeCAD, an open-source
parametric 3-D modeler (<a href="http://www.freecadweb.org" target="_self">www.freecadweb.org</a>). A parametric modeler builds the structures
in the design based on a set of properties. Changing the design, thus, is
simply a matter of changing the properties of said design. 
</p><p>
FreeCAD can
read and write several different file formats used in modelling and 3-D
printing. It is built as a core application, with plugin modules made
to handle specific jobs. Python is the language of choice, because there
actually is a built-in Python engine. Additionally, FreeCAD itself can be
imported into your own Python script. This gives you access to all of
the geometric tools for use in your own code.
</p><p>
FreeCAD already should be in your distribution's package management
system. In Debian-based ones, it is simply a matter of using the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install freecad
</pre>
</p><p>
In the latest version of Ubuntu, the latest version of
FreeCAD actually is available. But, you always have the option of building FreeCAD
from source, if you need some non-standard option. 
</p><p>
To start it, you can
just run <tt  >freecad</tt>. It will pop open a window with a blank workspace in
it (Figure 1). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793freecadf1.large.jpg"><img src="11793freecadf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. On start up, FreeCAD gives you a blank workspace so you can begin working.
</p></div></div><p>
FreeCAD uses a workbench concept to give you groups
of tools based on the task you are doing at any particular time. You
can access the available workbenches by clicking on the 
View&rarr;Workbench menu item. Here, you will get a drop-down list of all of the available
options. 
</p><p>
As I'm focusing on the idea of building a 3-D object,
let's start by activating the parts workbench. Clicking on the 
View&rarr;Workbench&rarr;Part menu item will rebuild the interface and introduce all
sorts of new tools for you to use (Figure 2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793freecadf2.large.jpg"><img src="11793freecadf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Selecting the parts workbench will change the interface,
giving you access to all sorts of new tools to use for building.
</p></div></div><p>
On the left-hand side,
you should see two sub-windows providing a tree view of the objects in
your design and a property view of specific objects. Along the bottom
are a report view and a Python window. The majority of the display 
currently is a blank slate. You need to start a new design by clicking on
File&rarr;New. This will open a new, unnamed document in
the main part of the GUI. It will be renamed when you first save the
project. You can do this by clicking File&rarr;Save. You
can add primitive objects to this new document either by clicking on
the associated icon in the top toolbar or by clicking on the 
Part&rarr;Primitives menu item.
</p><p>
Once you have an object in the document, you can
click on it to see its properties on the left-hand side. There are
two tabs in the property view pane. The initial tab is the View tab,
which provides details on the presentation of your object. The second
tab is the Data tab, which contains the details for the construction
of your object. 
</p><p>
In Figure 3, you can see a torus that
I have started to construct. A torus is described by three angles and
two radii. The first two angles describe how much of the torus exists
in the cylindrical direction. The third angle describes how much of
the torus exists around the circle. The first radius gives the overall
radius of the torus, and the second radius represents the cylindrical
radius.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793freecadf3.large.jpg"><img src="11793freecadf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can build your design based on primitive objects.
</p></div></div><p>
Lots of other tools are available as well. You can select a
different workbench by clicking on the View&rarr;Workbench menu item,
or you can select a new workbench from the drop-down menu in the center of
the top toolbar. 
</p><p>
To look at another example problem, say you wanted to
generate a mesh from your design to feed into some other program, like
a computational fluid dynamics program. To start, you will need to
select the mesh workbench. This will bring in a new set of tools to work
with meshes. You can generate a mesh from your design by clicking the 
Meshes&rarr;Create mesh from shape menu item. This will pop open a new pane
on
the left-hand side to control the meshing process. You can choose either
standard or mefisto meshing, along with the maximum edge length. Once
these are set, you can select the shape you want to mesh and click
OK. This will generate the mesh and leave you with a mesh information
box describing the number of points, facets and so on (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793freecadf4.large.jpg"><img src="11793freecadf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You even can do work on meshes with FreeCAD.
</p></div></div><p>
Tools are available to work on these meshes as well. For example, 
click on the Meshes&rarr;Analyze&rarr;Evaluate &amp; Repair mesh menu item. This
will pop up a new pane on the right-hand side where you can analyze your
new mesh and find problems like duplicated faces, duplicated points
or degenerated faces. If any of those issues are found, 
a repair button is available to go ahead and fix those issues. This
is something that is more likely to happen with very complex objects
created from several primitives stitched together. 
</p><p>
Once you have your
mesh generated and properly tweaked and optimized, you can click on
the Meshes&rarr;Export mesh menu item, and select the file format you
need. For example, if you want to use it in some project in CFX, you
could export it as a NASTRAN file. There are several options that should
be supported by most other programs that can take mesh files as input. So
FreeCAD can act as a very good pre-processing step in many projects.
</p><p>
Once you have finished your object, you will want to have it in a
format that can be used in some other context. To do this, you can export
your design in one of any number of available formats. For example,
if you want to send your design to a 3-D printer, you can export it in
an STL file format. To do that, click on File&rarr;Export
and select the stl option from the drop-down list (Figure 5). You then
can take this file and use it in the printing software for your 3-D printer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11793freecadf5.large.jpg"><img src="11793freecadf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can export your design to the STL file format.
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you can build your own objects, you can design the exact piece
you need for that scientific experiment, or create that specific replacement part
you need. If you can, you also should consider sharing your work in
one or more of the on-line libraries. That way, you may become famous
for your miracle widget or amazing do-hickey. In any case, it is
always good to share information so others can build on it to do
even greater things.

<h2 class="title">Slow System? iotop Is Your Friend</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #249, January 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Back in 2010, Kyle Rankin did an incredible series on Linux
Troubleshooting. In Part 1
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/hack-and-linux-troubleshooting-part-i-high-load" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/hack-and-linux-troubleshooting-part-i-high-load</a>),
he talked about troubleshooting a system struggling with a high load. At
that point, I'd already been a system administrator for more than a decade, but
it was the first time I'd ever heard of iotop.
</p><p>
If you weren't a subscriber in 2010, I highly recommend you read
Kyle's entire series. Either way, I use iotop so often, I felt it was
prudent to mention it again all these years later. The concept is pretty
simple. It's like the top program, but instead of CPU and memory usage, it
monitors disk I/O. If you have a system that is extremely slow to respond,
but can't seem to figure out what is going on, give iotop a try. You'll
probably have to install it, as I've never found a system with iotop
installed by default, but it should be in the software repository of just
about every Linux distro. And, if you find it useful? Be sure to read Kyle's
entire series; it's just as helpful today as it was five years ago!

<h2 class="title">Wondershaper&mdash;QOS in a Pinch</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #249, January 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In past articles, I've discussed my BirdCam setup and how it automatically
archives video footage from my bird feeders to YouTube every night. That's
a really cool process, but unfortunately, it saturates my upstream bandwidth
in the evening. I could get crafty with my firewall and limit the priority
of traffic from my BirdCam server, but because it's using standard Web
protocols to upload to YouTube, the firewall rules would be fairly complex.
Thankfully, there's Wondershaper.
</p><p>
Because I'm running my BirdCam server on an independent machine, it doesn't
affect any other programs on the server if I just limit the throughput on
my Ethernet interface. There are three basic ways I know of to limit bandwidth
on a Linux machine: using tc, trickle and Wondershaper.
</p><p>
The tc program is by far the most powerful. It's also by far the most
complex. In fact, it's so complex that for my lazy purposes, it just isn't
ideal. If you're looking for protocol-specific QOS on a local interface, tc
is probably the tool for the job. It is overkill for me.
</p><p>
The trickle (and trickled) program seems like an ideal way to control the
bandwidth on a per-application level. Supposedly, you simply can start a
program with trickle, and it will limit the bandwidth available. Try as I
might, however, I never could get it to do its job. Yes, I'm sure it's a
perfectly wonderful tool, but again, I want something dead simple. Enter:
Wondershaper.
</p><p>
After installing Wondershaper on your system, it works by controlling the
bandwidth on an entire interface. So this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo wondershaper eth0 1250 125
</pre>
</p><p>
will limit the eth0 interface to 10mbps down and 1mbps up. The numbers are
listed in KB/s (that wasn't clear to me at first, but Google will convert
mbps to KB/s for you). The setting is system-wide and should limit
bandwidth for any network application. To clear the limit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo wondershaper clear eth0
</pre>
</p><p>
I simply put the command in my root user's crontab to execute on startup,
and my BirdCam server doesn't monopolize my bandwidth when it uploads
nightly to YouTube. It seems like a simple tool, and it is. But, it works so
well and provides such a useful service, I'm making Wondershaper this
month's Editors' Choice winner. It's not a new program, but it's something
I'd never used before, and I can't imagine living without it!
</p><p>
(NOTE: before I get hundreds of e-mail messages, yes, I know Wondershaper is a program
from 2002. I mentioned other newer, more robust alternatives above, but
the truth is, Wondershaper still is a powerful, simple tool that does one
thing and does it really well.)
