The Security issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> always makes me feel a little
guilty. It turns out that although I have a fairly wide set of technology
skills, I'm not the person you want in charge of securing your network
or your systems. By default, Linux is designed with a moderate amount
of security in mind. For that, I am incredibly grateful. If you struggle
with maintaining security in your environment, this issue hopefully
will encourage and educate as opposed to making you feel guilty. My goal this
year is to learn and be encouraged by the Security issue, not just feel
bad. Please, join me!

Reuven M. Lerner starts us out with a continuation on last
month's multitenant programming, this time dealing with users and
permissions. With multiple users accessing the same program, security is
crucial, and Reuven helps us design intelligently. Dave Taylor follows
with a very helpful tutorial on using the <tt  >find</tt> command
with <tt  >xargs</tt>. The
<tt  >find</tt> command is incredibly powerful, and with the ability to feed it into
another program, it's indispensable. Dave walks through not only the
how, but the why as well.

Kyle Rankin gets serious about security this month with a practical
walk-through on the basics of running a secure server in the cloud. EC2
instances are commonplace in almost every company's infrastructure,
but having your server run completely in the open is a dangerous
endeavor without a very serious look at security. I go in the opposite
direction from Kyle this month and discuss spinning up servers
locally. Specifically, I talk about Vagrant. We've covered Vagrant in
the past, but it's one of those technologies that always has confused
me. This month, I break it down and explain how it works, what it does
and how you can get the best use out of it in your environment. If
you've ever been frustrated by Vagrant, or just avoided it altogether,
I urge you to read my column.

One of the biggest problems with securing a network is knowing where to
start. It's a lot easier to figure out that starting point if you know how
secure your network right now. Jeramiah Bowling describes the
process of doing an internal security review to identify problems. This
is great for finding holes in your existing security, but it's also great
if you're just starting to create your plan. It's easier to get started
when you can find the starting line! Federico Kereki follows Jeramiah
with an article on detecting bogus login attempts and mitigating the
threat they represent. Having a good password is key to keeping hackers
out, but if they have unlimited guesses, eventually your system might
succumb to the attacks. Federico shows how to set up a banning system
to disable logins when someone tries and fails over and over.

Finally, Mike Diehl has a great tutorial on securing Web traffic
with Squid. Every organization has different needs when it comes to a Web
policy, and for Mike, he does the same sort of thing for his home. Whether
you're looking to lock down your corporate Internet access, or want
to protect your family from various Internet topics, Mike's process
is very educational.

Like many things in the Linux world, security isn't a thing you
&ldquo;do&rdquo;,
it's a &ldquo;way&rdquo; you do things in general. Rather than set up your
system and network, and then try to secure it as an afterthought, thinking
with a security-focused mindset from the beginning is key. This issue
offers some great insight on security matters, and hopefully, it sparks
an interest for further change in your network. At the very least, this
issue should force you to take a look at your own security practices. As
for me? I'm going to read Jeramiah's article and do a security review
of my own systems!
