How to detect dubious login attempts and deny access to hackers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x26372a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Whenever a server is accessible via the Internet, it's a safe bet that
hackers will be trying to access it. Just look at the SSH logs
for any server you use, and you'll surely find lots of &ldquo;authentication
failure&rdquo; lines, originating from IPs that have nothing to do with you
or your business. Brute-force attempts (such as &ldquo;dictionary
attacks&rdquo;)
try different passwords over and over to try to get into your box,
and there's always a chance that they eventually will succeed. Thus,
it's a good idea to apply these &ldquo;three Ds&rdquo; for your security:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>detect</em></span> intruder attempts, <span   class="emphasis"><em>decide</em></span> when they've gone &ldquo;over the
top&rdquo;
(past what would be acceptable for honest-to-goodness typing mistakes),
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>deny</em></span> them access at least for a (longish!) while.

</p><p>
Several tools manage this kind of monitoring (see the Resources
section). In this article, I describe installing, configuring
and running DenyHosts. With it, you'll have a running background d&aelig;mon
that will check your system continuously for access attempts, decide if
they look unsafe, block them and inform you. DenyHosts even can be
configured to share information with other servers, so whenever a hacker
is detected on one system, it will be blocked on other systems too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x2637778"></a>
Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
DenyHosts' current version is 2.6 (from June 2013). It is a Python
script, and you probably already have that language installed. If not,
you'll need to use your distribution package tool to set it up first. You
need version 2.3 or higher.
</p><p>
Many distributions already provide a &ldquo;denyhosts&rdquo; package, and using
your system tools is the simplest installation method. For example, type
<tt  >sudo apt-get install denyhosts</tt> for Ubuntu,
<tt  >sudo yum install
denyhosts</tt> for Red Hat or <tt  >sudo zypper install
denyhosts</tt> for
OpenSUSE. Otherwise, you can download the tar.gz file (see
Resources) and then do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar zxvf DenyHosts-2.6.tar.gz
$ cd DenyHosts-2.6
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
No matter how you install DenyHosts, a /usr/share/denyhosts will be
created, with all configuration and script files within it. You'll
want to edit the denyhosts.cfg file to configure DenyHosts for your
environment. (Should that file not exist, do <tt  >cp denyhosts.cfg-dist
denyhosts.cfg</tt> to get a basic sample configuration file to start
with.) Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored. There
are plenty of comments to help you understand each configuration item,
but pay close attention to some key items (Table 1).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x253f580.0x2637b40"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Key Configuration Items for DenyHosts</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Key Configuration Items for DenyHosts11798t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Parameters</th><th>Explanations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SECURE_LOG</td><td>Location of the access log: /var/log/secure for Red Hat,
/var/log/auth.log for Ubuntu or OpenSUSE, and so on. DenyHosts will scan
this file to detect possible hacking attempts.</td></tr><tr><td>
HOSTS_DENY</td><td>Location of the restricted host file, usually
/etc/hosts.deny. DenyHosts will add lines to this file whenever a possible
intruder is detected.</td></tr><tr><td>
LOCK_FILE</td><td>A file path and name: this file is created when DenyHosts starts
and is deleted when it exits. If you try to run DenyHosts, and this file
exists, Denyhosts will exit immediately, preventing more than one instance
from running at the same time.</td></tr><tr><td>
WORK_DIR</td><td>The directory DenyHosts will use for its own data.</td></tr><tr><td>
DAEMON_LOG</td><td>Location of the log file that DenyHosts will use to report its
status when run in d&aelig;mon mode.</td></tr><tr><td>
DAEMON_SLEEP</td><td>Amount of time that DenyHosts will wait before checking the
SECURE_LOG.</td></tr><tr><td>
DAEMON_PURGE</td><td>Amount of time between purges of old entries in HOSTS_DENY (see
PURGE_DENY below).</td></tr><tr><td>
BLOCK_SERVICE</td><td>What service should be blocked in HOSTS_DENY. Set it to
&ldquo;sshd&rdquo; to
disable only SSH access or to &ldquo;ALL&rdquo; to block every attempt from the remote
host.</td></tr><tr><td>
ADMIN_EMAIL</td><td>Address to which e-mail messages regarding blocked hosts and suspicious
logins should be sent. If you set this to a non-blank value, you'll need to
set SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD as well, so DenyHosts
can connect to your mail server.</td></tr><tr><td>
DENY_THRESHOLD_INVALID,
DENY_THRESHOLD_VALID and
DENY_THRESHOLD_ROOT</td><td>After how many failed login attempts DenyHosts should block a host (due to wrong user account
names, correct user names but wrong passwords or failed root access
attempts). But, you shouldn't allow remote
root access at all; see the Resources section for some suggestions about
this!</td></tr><tr><td>
RESET_ON_SUCCESS</td><td>If set to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the failed count for the server will be reset to
zero after a successful login.</td></tr><tr><td>
AGE_RESET_INVALID,
AGE_RESET_VALID and
AGE_RESET_ROOT</td><td>After what period of time the failed count for the host will be
reset to 0 for wrong user account attempts, wrong password attempts and
root access attempts.</td></tr><tr><td>
PURGE_DENY</td><td>Time after which HOSTS_DENY entries will be purged if you run
DenyHosts with the --purge flag. I usually go with &ldquo;1w&rdquo; (one
week), but you
can leave it blank (never purge), or you can use minutes, hours, days or
weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>
PURGE_THRESHOLD</td><td>How many times a host can be purged until DenyHosts decides it's a
confirmed risk and stops purging it, thus disabling it forever. Set this
to zero to disable the feature.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
As an extra assurance that you won't be banned from your own server, you
should edit /etc/hosts.allow and add a line for each IP you use, in a
format like <tt  >sshd: 111.222.33.44</tt>. DenyHosts has a file of its own,
allowed-hosts, that defines IPs (one per line) that won't ever
be blocked.
</p><p>
Now you are ready to start running DenyHosts&mdash;let's move on to that!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x262f818"></a>
Running DenyHosts</h2></div></div><p>
You can run DenyHosts periodically (let's say as a cron job),
but it's better to run it in d&aelig;mon mode. DenyHosts then will run in the
background, checking the access logs to detect possible intruders. For
this, you need to create an extra configuration file by executing
<tt  >cp daemon-control-dist daemon-control</tt>. Then, edit the file to
make sure its three parameters are defined correctly (Table 2).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x253f580.0x262f978"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. Running DenyHosts in d&aelig;mon mode requires extra
configuration.</b></p><table     summary="Table 2. Running DenyHosts in d&aelig;mon mode requires extra&#10;configuration.11798t2.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Parameters</th><th>Explanations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>DENYHOSTS_BIN</td><td>Should point to the denyhosts.py script.</td></tr><tr><td>
DENYHOSTS_CFG</td><td>Should point to the denyhosts.cfg configuration file.</td></tr><tr><td>
DENYHOSTS_LOCK</td><td>Should point to the same file as LOCK_FILE in Table 1.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Then, all you need to do is start the service with
<tt  >/etc/init.d/denyhosts restart</tt> or <tt  >service
denyhosts restart</tt>,
depending on your server, and you are set. From that moment on, DenyHosts
will monitor login attempts, and upon detection of oft-repeated
failures, it will decide to deny all access to the would-be intruder
(Figure 1).
Just in case, you also should set DenyHosts to
start automatically on reboot&mdash;doing <tt  >sudo chkconfig
denyhosts on</tt> 
is a way to manage this.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11798f1.large.jpg"><img src="11798f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. DenyHosts monitors the access logs and eventually locks out the
hacker's host.
</p></div></div><p>
Once DenyHosts is running, it will monitor the logs, and after detecting
repeated failed login attempts, when certain thresholds are reached, it
will decide to block the remote IP to deny the would-be hacker all
possibilities of connection. For example, I deliberately entered wrong
passwords time after time, and eventually I was blocked (Figure 1 also explains why DenyHosts needs to run as root; otherwise,
it wouldn't be able to edit the hosts.deny file):



<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; ssh fkereki@your.own.server
fkereki@your.own.server's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
fkereki@your.own.server's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
fkereki@your.own.server's password: 
Permission denied (publickey,password).
&gt; ssh fkereki@your.own.server
fkereki@your.own.server's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
fkereki@your.own.server's password: 
Permission denied, please try again.
fkereki@your.own.server's password: 
Permission denied (publickey,password).

.
.
.
several attempts, and then...

&gt; ssh fkereki@your.own.server
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
</pre>
</p><p>
DenyHosts eventually will lift the restriction (depending on the
configuration), but if a valid user somehow managed to get banned from
a valid server, you can fix the problem without further delay (see the
Forgiving a User sidebar).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x2630478"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Don't Get Locked Out!</b></p><p>
It goes without saying, you should test DenyHosts to verify
that it's running. Of course, and most important, keep at least an open shell
in your server while you do your testing; otherwise, should anything
go wrong, you could get locked out of your own IP address, and you'd have a
nice problem!
</p><p>
While you try accessing the server from a different machine, you can use
<tt  >tail -f</tt> to monitor both the hosts.deny file and DenyHosts' own log
file (see the HOSTS_DENY and DAEMON_LOG configuration parameters in Table 1). After
a few failed attempts, you should see changes in both files, and you
should be getting an e-mail message as well, confirming that your configuration
is fine.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x2630738"></a>
Sharing Results</h2></div></div><p>
DenyHosts provides another service that allows you to share whatever
IPs you block with other servers around the world, and vice versa. The
idea is simple. If anybody detects that hacking attempts are coming from
a certain IP, every server that blocks it without waiting to be attacked
is made a bit safer. There are a few parameters you need to consider,
as shown in Table 3.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x253f580.0x2630898"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 3. Sharing blocked IPs with other servers helps everybody.</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 3. Sharing blocked IPs with other servers helps everybody.11798t3.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Parameters</th><th>Explanations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>
SYNC_SERVER</td><td>To what server you should connect for central synchronization.
Currently, xmlrpc.denyhosts.net:9911 is the only available server, but in
the future, organizations may install their own synchronizing servers for
internal usage.</td></tr><tr><td>
SYNC_INTERVAL</td><td>How often to synchronize with the server.</td></tr><tr><td>
SYNC_UPLOAD and
SYNC_DOWNLOAD</td><td>Whether DenyHosts should upload and download banned IPs; the logical
option is YES in both cases.</td></tr><tr><td>
SYNC_DOWNLOAD_THRESHOLD</td><td>Download only IPs that have been detected and blocked at least by
this number of DenyHosts distinct servers.</td></tr><tr><td>
SYNC_DOWNLOAD_RESILIENCY</td><td>Download only IPs that have been detected over this period. The
larger this value, the more probable the IP is an actual hacker.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Sharing this information is usually a good idea, so you can stave off
would-be hackers even before they start sniffing at your server. The
sharing service currently is free (although donations are accepted), but
eventually businesses might be charged for it, as the DenyHosts FAQ
states. You can contact the DenyHosts creator to license the server
component and run your own sharing server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x2631130"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Forgiving Users</b></p><p>
No matter how careful, once in a while someone messes up, enters the
wrong password too many times and gets banned by DenyHosts. How can you
fix this? Once you've decided that the errant user should be forgiven,
take the following steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Learn the user's current IP so you can enable it again.
</p></li><li><p>
Stop DenyHosts.
</p></li><li><p>
Check every file in the WORK_DIR directory (see Table 1), and delete every
line in which the IP appears (using <tt  >grep</tt> will help).
</p></li><li><p>
Edit /etc/hosts.deny in the same way.
</p></li><li><p>
Restart DenyHosts.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Now, if the user tries again, access should be granted. Don't be tempted
to skip step 3. If you do, as soon as you restart DenyHosts, the remote
IP will be blocked again!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x253f580.0x26317b8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Security is a 24/7 job, and all the tools that you can add into the mix go
a long way toward making your server secure. DenyHosts is easy to install,
and it provides quick detection of hacking attempts, blocking remote hackers
and impeding brute-force attacks. Although it's not a &ldquo;silver
bullet&rdquo; solution
for all possible intruder problems, it's a worthy tool that you should
add to your security toolkit. Give it a try!
