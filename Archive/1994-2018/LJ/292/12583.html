<h1 class="title">Lessons in Vendor Lock-in: Shaving</h1>


<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Learn how to embrace open standards while you remove stubble. By Kyle
Rankin</h2>

<p>
Freedom is powerful. When you start using free software, a whole world opens up
to you, and you start viewing everything in a different light. You start
noticing when vendors don't release their code or when they try to lock you
in to their products with proprietary protocols. These vendor lock-in techniques
aren't new or even unique to software. Companies long have tried to force
customer loyalty with incompatible proprietary products that make you stay on an
upgrade treadmill. Often you can apply these free software principles outside
the software world, so in this article, I describe my own object
lesson in vendor lock-in from the shaving industry.
</p>

<p>
When I first started shaving, I was pretty intimidated with the notion of a
sharp blade against my face so I picked the easiest and least-intimidating
route: electric razors. Of course, electric razors have a large up-front cost,
and after some time, you have to buy replacement blades. Still, the shaves were
acceptable as far as I knew, so I didn't mind much.
</p>

<p>
At some point in my shaving journey, Gillette released the Mach 3 disposable
razor. For some reason, this design appealed to a lot of geeks, and I ended up
hearing about it on geek-focused blogs like Slashdot back in the day. I decided
to try it out, and after I got over the initial intimidation, I realized it
really wasn't all that hard to shave with it, and due to the multiple blades and
lubricating strip along the top, I got a much closer shave.
</p>

<p>
I was a convert. I ditched my electric razor and went all in with the Mach 3.
Of course, those disposable blades had the tendency to wear out pretty quickly,
along with that blue lubricating strip, so I'd find myself dropping a few
bucks per blade to get refills after a few shaves. Then again, Gillette was
famous for the concept of giving away the razor and making its money on the
blade, so this wasn't too surprising.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
We're Going to Four Blades!</h3>

<p>
The tide started turning for me a few years later when Gillette decided to
deprecate the Mach 3 in favor of a new design—this time with four blades, a
lubricating strip <em>and</em> a rubber strip along the bottom! Everyone was supposed to
switch over to this new and more expensive design, but I was perfectly happy
with what I was using, and the new blades were incompatible with my Mach 3
razor,
so I didn't pay it much attention.
</p>

<p>
The problem was that with this new design, replacement Mach 3 blades became
harder and harder to come by, and all of the blades started creeping up in
price. Eventually, I couldn't buy Mach 3 blades in bulk at my local warehouse
store, and finally I gave up and bought one of the even more expensive new
Gillette razors. What else could I do?
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Learn from Your Elders</h3>

<p>
The turning point came when I read an article from The Art of Manliness blog
called "Shave like your Grandpa" that described classic wet shaving techniques
using big metal double-edged safety razors. I was fed up with the upgrade
treadmill from proprietary plastic disposable razors, and I was intrigued at
learning this lost art. More important, I found out that safety razors all
used the same generic razor blade design and have for decades. As a result, you
don't have to worry about incompatibility whether you find a safety razor in an
antique store or buy one manufactured last week. Also, since every supplier is
working off of the same open standard, blades are cheap—packs of five blades
in a drug store are a dollar or two compared to three or four dollars per blade
for modern disposables, and in bulk, they are less than ten cents apiece!
</p>

<p>
I was sold. I went to a local antique store and found a safety razor for about
$10. Next I got a cheap pack of razor blades from the drug store, and I was ready to
go. Of course, there was a learning curve with this solution, just like when I
switched from Windows to Linux so many years ago. Everything was different, and
many things were more difficult to do at first. With Linux, this meant
spending a lot of time reading documentation, figuring out commands and
repairing systems I broke. With shaving, this meant using a styptic pen to stop
the bleeding!
</p>

<p>
Of course, in both cases, before too long, I climbed the learning curve and was
getting superior results and had no intention of ever going back. If you've
never tried wet shaving, you may not realize what this freedom from vendor
lock-in means. It means if I see an interesting used safety razor in an antique
store or if I see a nice new one online, I can get it without having to throw
away all my existing razor blades. It also means if I find a new razor blade
brand with a better price or better quality, I can switch over to it knowing my
razor is automatically compatible.
</p>

<p>
Because there's no vendor lock-in and because the razor blade design is open,
competition flourishes, and blade prices drop as a result, even among the
higher-end vendors. I buy razor blades in packs of 100 online for less than $10 knowing
that I'm set for another two to three years. No more worrying about the
constantly increasing prices of disposable blades or planned obsolescence from
manufacturers to force me to some new design that adds a vibrating motor.
Instead, I'm free to pick from a huge array of safety razor designs from many
different companies both past and present. Just this last weekend, I was walking
through an antique store and saw a 1961 Gillette "Fat Boy" adjustable safety
razor that is well known and popular in safety razor collector's forums both
for the unique design and for the great shave it can give. I bought it knowing
that after cleaning it up, I could pop in a new blade from my collection, and it
would just work.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
The Legacy of Open Standards</h3>

<p>
The power of open standards extends beyond today into the future. When my son
gets old enough to shave, I can pass down one of my all-metal, decades-old
antique razors to him, and it will still work. While everyone else in a decade
will have to shave with some $20-per-blade disposable razor with three aloe strips,
seven blades, and some weird vibrating and rotating motor, he will be able to pick
any razor from my collection and find affordable replacement blades. This is
the power of open standards and the freedom to avoid vendor lock-in.
