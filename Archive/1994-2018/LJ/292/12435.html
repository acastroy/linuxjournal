<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Ever wondered how to <code>tail -F /var/log/messages</code> from multiple servers at
once? Read on. By Fabien Wernli</h2>

<p>
Troubleshooting Linux systems can be challenging, especially at times when
the tools available to system administrators are constantly evolving.
But, it's hard to avoid using some classic utilities on a daily basis.
One of them can be summarized by the following command:

</p>
<pre><code>
tail -F /var/log/messages
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Reviewing logs is indeed a key player of the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html">"Utilization Saturation and
Errors" (USE) method</a>.
While storing historic logs from many servers in a centralized storage engine
like <a href="http://elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> has
become quite common nowadays, it's sometimes important to have a low-latency
view of what's happening right now in your infrastructure. Unfortunately,
there is no standard out-of-the-box tool to view logs in real time
simultaneously on all hosts of a data center.
</p>

<p>
Here are some use cases where low-latency treatment makes sense, along with
an example for each:
</p>

<ul><li>
Security incidents: account Y is compromised; trigger an alert for each
successful connection attempt site-wide.
</li>

<li>
Change management: committed a new change to configuration management; show
each
hosts' resource status as it changes.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Real-time data mining: show all nodes on which application Z is currently
serving more than N requests per second.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This article shows how to set up a site-wide low-latency
(sub-millisecond) log shipping infrastructure. I'll do this with minimal
intrusion and demonstrate its usage in the command-line interface, just like
good-old <code>tail -f /var/log/messages</code>.
</p>

<p>
As your mileage may vary, let's stick to a simple scenario that you can
adapt to your own use case. Most instructions given here are for recent
Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions, but they easily can be adapted to other
environments.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Scenario</h3>

<p>
Let's assume a number of Linux or UNIX servers, and that you'd
like to be able to subscribe to all or a subset of their logs in real time,
using a terminal.
Let's refer to these servers as the <em>clients</em>.
</p>

<p>
Let's further assume that they all have a running syslog collection dæmon, which
you'll configure to forward the logs to a remote server that will serve as the
log subscription <em>hub</em>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you'll use a <em>control node</em> that will serve as the login
host. This will be the human-machine interface. The control node can be the
same machine as the hub, or you can use your workstation or laptop, provided
the firewalls are set up accordingly.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Software</h3>

<p>
Although no extra software is required on the <em>clients</em>, you'll need
the following on the <em>hub</em>:
</p>

<ul><li>
syslog-ng &gt;= 3.6.1 (or earlier with syslog-ng-incubator).
</li>

<li>
riemann = 0.3.0.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the <em>control node</em>, you'll need to install the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
A websocket (WS) client or a server-side-event (SSE) client:
python websocket-client = 0.47.0 <em>or</em> nodejs wscat = 2.1.1.
</li>

<li>
riemann-dash = 0.2.14 (optional).
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
How It Works</h3>

<p>
Before getting your hands dirty modifying configuration files, let's get a glimpse of the big picture.
See Figure 1 for a diagram of the overall architecture and event flow.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Architecture Diagram" src="12435f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 1. Architecture Diagram</p>
</div>

<p>This diagram shows the following:</p>

<ol><li>
An application "app" on the <em>client</em> calls <code>syslog()</code> to
log a message about an event.
</li>

<li>
The local syslog dæmon captures the event and sends it to the remote
<em>hub</em> using the syslog protocol.
</li>

<li>
The syslog-ng dæmon on the <em>hub</em>
forwards the event to the riemann dæmon using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a>.
</li>

<li>
The <em>control node</em> issues a subscription request to the <em>hub</em>
using either WS or SSE.
</li>

<li>
The riemann dæmon on the <em>hub</em> parses the query and starts
forwarding matching events to the <em>control node</em>.
</li>

<li>
The <em>control node</em> parses incoming events and displays them on your
terminal in real time.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The whole process, from step 1 to 6, usually takes less than a tenth of a
millisecond (three sigma), even if tens of thousands of events happen per
second.
</p>

<p>
From the user's perspective, the workflow steps are the following:
</p>

<ol><li>
<code>ssh</code> to the control node.
</li>

<li>
Run the CLI with query as argument.
</li>

<li>
Read messages on the terminal.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Syslog-ng acts as a syslog-forwarder to riemann.
Riemann acts as a real-time synchronous event publisher and subscription manager.
It can push events matching a certain query using a websocket, for instance,
to a command-line client or web browser.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Riemann Queries in a Nutshell</h3>

<p>
The query must be in riemann's domain-specific language, which is very simple
but quite strict. Basically, you have to remember that riemann events have
tags and attributes. You can query tags using the <code>tagged "foo"</code>
pragma and attributes with <code>key = "value"</code>. You can combine
conditions using <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators, and use the special
wild-card character "%" in attribute expressions in the following form:

</p>
<pre><code>
MESSAGE =~ "%quick brown fox%"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You can learn more about queries on the <a href="http://riemann.io">Riemann
website</a>. You could, for
instance, subscribe to all events having a syslog priority of "warning":

</p>
<pre><code>
PRIORITY = "warning"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Or subscribe to all events:

</p>
<pre><code>
true
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Or match events from a given IP address:

</p>
<pre><code>
HOST_FROM = "172.18.0.1"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Setup</h3>


<p><em>
Clients:</em>
</p>

<p>
On the <em>clients</em>, you'll need to configure the local syslog dæmon to
forward all events to the <em>hub</em>.
</p>

<p>
The precise method depends on the syslog application you use on the
<em>client</em>.
If you are using legacy syslogd or rsyslog, add the following line to your
(r)syslog.conf file:

</p>
<pre><code>
* @hub.example.com
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you are using syslog-ng, add the following lines to your syslog-ng.conf file:

</p>
<pre><code>
destination d_hub {
  network(
    'hub.example.com',
    transport(udp),
    port(514),
    flags(syslog-protocol)
  );
};
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
And, don't forget to add the new destination to your existing log path (see the Configuration section for an example).
</p>

<p><em>
hub:</em>
</p>

<p>
On the <em>hub</em>, you have more work to do, as you'll be installing and configuring both syslog-ng and riemann.
Make sure to download and install at least the versions listed earlier.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Installation</h3>

<p>
The procedure to install syslog-ng highly depends on the operating system you are using.
On recent Debian-based GNU/Linux distributions, chances are the distribution packages will contain a recent enough version:

</p>
<pre><code>
apt install syslog-ng-mod-riemann
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If your distribution doesn't provide the required version, the <a href="https://syslog-ng.com/open-source-log-management">syslog-ng
project's home page</a> has pointers to download packages for various
platforms. Last but not least, there's always the option of building your own
binaries using the source code available on <a href="https://github.com/balabit/syslog-ng">GitHub</a>. If you decide to go
down that path, make sure to enable the riemann destination in the
compilation options.
</p>

<p>
Installing riemann is just a matter of downloading the package from its
website and grabbing a copy of a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). On
Debian, the most straightforward option is to install
<code>openjdk-8-jre-headless</code>. You can also build riemann from source (see
instructions on its <a href="https://github.com/riemann/riemann">GitHub
page</a>). On Debian/Stretch, you could do the
following:

</p>
<pre><code>
apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
wget https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases/download/
↪0.3.0/riemann_0.3.0_all.deb
dpkg -i riemann_0.3.0_all.deb
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Configuration</h3>

<p>
The syslog-ng configuration given here is the minimum required for the task
at hand.
It doesn't technically conflict with the existing syslog-daemon
implementation, unless it's already listening on the UDP port 514. However,
on Debian-based distributions, installing syslog-ng will uninstall rsyslog,
because the packages conflict with one another.
</p>

<p>
In this light, you'll add a drop-in file,
/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf.d/riemann.conf, that syslog-ng will
include in the main configuration file. That way, it won't interfere with
the configuration file provided in the distribution:

</p>
<pre><code>
# syslog listener definition on *:514/udp
source s_syslog {
  network(
    ip('0.0.0.0')
    transport(udp)
    port(514)
    flags(syslog-protocol)
  );
};
# riemann destination definition
destination d_riemann {
  riemann(
    server('127.0.0.1')
    port(5555)
    type('tcp')
    ttl('300')
    state("${state:-ok}")
    attributes(
      scope(all-nv-pairs rfc5424)
    )
    tags('syslog')
  );
};
# log path
log {
  source(s_syslog);
  destination(d_riemann);
};
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Ensure that the /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf file includes the
following line; otherwise, syslog-ng will ignore the
/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf.d/riemann.conf file:

</p>
<pre><code>
@include "/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/*.conf"
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The above configuration defines a syslog listener on standard UDP port 514, a
riemann destination and a log path connecting the two. Refer to the
<a href="https://syslog-ng.com/documentation">syslog-ng documentation</a> for any details on the syntax used here.
</p>

<p>
The riemann configuration is given in its entirety. You simply can replace
the shipped /etc/riemann/riemann.config with the following:

</p>
<pre><code>
; Configure logging
(logging/init {:file "/var/log/riemann/riemann.log"})

; Disable riemann's internal instrumentation
(instrumentation {:enabled? false})

; Listen on the local interface over TCP (5555), websockets
; (5556), and server-side-events (5558)
(let [host "0.0.0.0"]
  (tcp-server {:host host :port 5555})
  (ws-server  {:host host :port 5556})
  (sse-server {:host host :port 5558}))

; Expire old events from the index every 5 seconds.
(periodically-expire 5)

; Index all events with a default time-to-live of 60 seconds
(let [index (index)]
  (streams
    (default :ttl 60
      index)))
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
This configuration sets up three listeners:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Port 5555 will receive events from syslog-ng in protobuf format.
</li>

<li>
Port 5556 will listen for websocket subscriptions.
</li>

<li>
Port 5558 will listen for server-side-event subscriptions.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
It also disables riemann's instrumentation service, so you're not confused
with internal messages and can focus only on syslog.
</p>

<p>
Refer to riemann's resources on the website—especially the how-to
section for details on the configuration syntax.
</p>

<p>
Now that both syslog-ng and riemann are configured to your needs, check the
configurations for errors:

</p>
<pre><code>
syslog-ng -f /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf -s
riemann test /etc/riemann/riemann.config
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If both return without errors, (re)start the services:

</p>
<pre><code>
service riemann start
service syslog-ng restart
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Control Node</h3>

<p>
The last thing you need to connect all the dots is the command-line interface
that will let you <code>tail -F</code> all logs from all the
<em>clients</em>. There
are a number of options here: the CLI you need should support either
websockets or server-side-events. Both are technologies borrowed from the web
that allow the web server (Riemann in this case) to push data to the client,
instead of the client pulling.
</p>

<p>
You'll be using websockets, as existing software tends to be more generally
available. There is a convenient <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/websocket-client">Python package</a> that works right out of
the box:

</p>
<pre><code>
pip install websocket-client
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Alternatively, you also can use a <a href="https://blog.grandcentrix.net/a-command-line-websocket-client">Node.js
implementation</a>:

</p>
<pre><code>
npm install -g wscat
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now, subscribe to the syslog flow:

</p>
<pre><code>
# subscribe to all events (query 'true')
wscat --connect 'ws://hub.example.com:5556/index?subscribe=
↪true&amp;query=true'
# or
wsdump.py -r 'ws://hub.example.com:5556/index?subscribe=
↪true&amp;query=true'
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that you may have to URL-encode the query:

</p>
<pre><code>
# subscribe to events matching the query 'PRIORITY = "warning"'
wsdump.py -r 'ws://hub.example.com:5556/index?subscribe=
↪true&amp;query=PRIORITY+%3D+%22warning%22'
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Let's push some events to it by crafting a syslog message from another shell:

</p>
<pre><code>
logger -d -n hub.example.com -p 4 -t foo bar baz
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
On the WS CLI, you immediately should see:

</p>
<pre><code>
{"host":"172.18.0.1","service":"test","state":"ok",
↪"description":null,"metric":null,"tags":["syslog"],"time":
↪"2018-04-10T13:36:04.787Z","ttl":300.0,"DATE":"Apr 10 
↪15:36:04","HOST":"172.18.0.1","FACILITY":"user","MESSAGE":
↪"bar baz",".SDATA.timeQuality.isSynced":"0","HOST_FROM":
↪"172.18.0.1","SOURCE":"s_syslog",".SDATA.timeQuality.tzKnown":
↪"1","PRIORITY":"warning","PROGRAM":"foo"}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you want to see a more traditional representation of the message (as in
/var/log/messages), you can pipe the client's output through the <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq">jq
utility</a> in the following way:

</p>
<pre><code>
wsdump.py -r [...] | jq -r '"\(.time) \(.HOST) \(.PROGRAM) 
 ↪\(.MESSAGE)"'
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
In which case, you'll see:

</p>
<pre><code>
2018-04-10T14:04:53.489Z 172.18.0.1 foo bar baz
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>
To troubleshoot syslog-ng, run it in the foreground in debug mode:

</p>
<pre><code>
syslog-ng -Fdv
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Although very verbose, the parser and debug messages are extremely valuable when
tracking configuration or payload issues.
</p>

<p>
If needed, feel free to subscribe to the very friendly <a href="https://lists.balabit.hu/mailman/listinfo/syslog-ng">official mailing
list</a>,
where many users and also the core developers are active.
</p>

<p>
Debugging riemann configuration problems can be challenging, especially if
you've never programmed in Clojure before. If there is a syntax error, like a
missing parenthesis, you quickly can be flooded by Java stack traces. Be
patient and try to find the relevant bits in the trace messages.
</p>

<p>
If that doesn't suffice, there's a very <a href="http://riemann.io/support.html">helpful community on IRC and the
mailing-list</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
What's Next?</h3>

<p>
Now that you've got a working proof of concept (PoC), there are quite a few
things you can do to improve the system. Although I won't go into much detail
about those things, here are a few ideas based on our experience at <a href="https://cc.in2p3.fr">CCIN2P3</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Security</h3>

<p>
First off, you might want to add a bit of security to the setup. You actually
made things quite worse while moving from <code>ssh+tail -f messages</code> to
the websocket solution. Anyone on the network now can subscribe to the whole
site's syslog, without any authentication. Luckily, there's a simple
solution to this: set up a reverse proxy in front of riemann's websocket
listener. As authentication is very site-specific, I won't cover it
extensively here. However, here's a simple example using the <a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy web server</a>
and basic authentication:

</p>
<pre><code>
# /etc/Caddyfile
hub.example.com:5559 {
  tls self_signed
  basicauth / user pass
  proxy / localhost:5556 {
    websocket
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
This configuration will listen to the external port 5559 and proxy the
traffic to local port 5556 if the user provided correct credentials. This
only makes sense if riemann is reconfigured to listen on the local network
interface.
</p>

<p>
On the <em>control node</em>, you now can connect to the proxy using basic
authentication:

</p>
<pre><code>
wsdump.py --headers 'Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz' -r 
 ↪'wss://hub.example.com:5559/index?subscribe=true&amp;query=true' -n
# or
wscat -n --auth user:pass --connect 'wss://hub.example.com:5559/
↪index?subscribe=true&amp;query=true'
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that the Python CLI doesn't support supplying basic auth credentials on
the command line, so you need to pass the base64 encoded
<code>user:pass</code> using
an HTTP header.
</p>

<p>
Another improvement could be to write a higher-level CLI that integrates with
your local organization's central authentication mechanisms. For example, it
could leverage roles from a central identity directory and apply access
control lists. Those could be host-based or even application-based: role A
can subscribe to events matching queries X, Y and Z.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Stream Processing</h3>

<p>
Both software suites installed on the hub can be leveraged further to
filter, aggregate and even correlate syslog messages.
</p>

<p>
Although syslog-ng can do this in a more traditional fashion by using
configuration elements like filters, parsers and template functions, riemann
on the other hand gives you full control over the event flow. In fact, its
configuration file is code that will be compiled, so you can do
virtually anything. One of the most common usages in the wild for both
software packages are structuring incoming data. Although you saw that syslog
events already feature some structure in the form of key/value pairs, both
riemann and syslog-ng can help you extract or add additional features to your
events. Those will help you filter the live stream of events and answer real
questions.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Web App</h3>

<p>
There is a web interface (<a href="http://riemann.io/dashboard.html">riemann-dash</a>) that takes advantage of
riemann's subscription mechanism.
It can display events in textual, grid or even graphical form, and it's
invaluable when you want to monitor changes in real time in a distributed
application.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Resiliency</h3>

<p>
Another caveat of this PoC is that this <em>hub</em> is a single point of
failure (SPoF).
You could do the following to improve the situation:
</p>

<ul><li>
Install syslog-ng on all the clients.
</li>

<li>
Configure all syslog-ng instances to send the logs to multiple riemann
servers.
</li>

<li>
Write a high-level CLI that uses load-balancing to subscribe to the riemann
servers' streams.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Dockerfile</h3>

<p>
For your convenience, a GitHub repository containing the means to build a
<a href="https://github.com/ccin2p3/docker-distributed-tail--f-messages">Docker
container for the solution described in this article</a> is at your
disposal. It includes the steps on how to build, run and use the
container.</p>
