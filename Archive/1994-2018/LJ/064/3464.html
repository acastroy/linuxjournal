first thing I did was research the stocks I found most interesting.
Yahoo's stock section is quite good&mdash;many important-looking numbers
and graphs. The graphs took me by surprise&mdash;I hadn't, at the time,
thought about on-the-fly images. Much of the data used for the
graphs is fairly static (one-, three- and five-year reports, for
example), but it makes no sense to keep these graphs around
permanently. It would be an awful waste of disk space, and the data
might change unexpectedly.
</p><p>I am now far more familiar with image development in general,
but until recently I was still fairly unclear on how dynamic
graphics were built for the Web. I was, that is, until
<i  >Linux Journal</i> sent me a copy of Shawn
Wallace's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Web Graphics with Perl and GNU
Software</em></span>. Although most of the graphs seen on the Web
these days use in-house developed tools, many of them started out
using the same tools described by Shawn, such as ImageMagick and
the GD library.</p><p>As the name implies, Shawn's text focuses on writing tools
using Perl. Almost all of the tools he talks about in detail have a
Perl module, making it easy to integrate them into your scripts.
Other tools work from the command line, so calling them from Perl
is still fairly easy.</p><p>The text opens with some basic network graphic issues and a
comparison of the most popular (web-supported) graphic file
formats. The comparisons are quite good, providing information on
header formats and some pointers on when and where these formats
are best used. One interesting bit was on JPEG (Joint Photographic
Experts Group). Apparently, the compression techniques in JPEG work
well for the human eye's perception of color, but tend to distort
text much more than GIF (Graphic Interchange Format). I didn't know
that before reading this, and now understand that screenshots of
dialog windows are probably better saved as GIFs. The trade-off, of
course, is in file size. No format is perfect.</p><p>A couple of good and bad things can be said about the book.
First, it sticks to well-known and published standards&mdash;in other
words, it sticks to HTML 3.2. That is a good thing, but
unfortunately it doesn't talk about HTML 4.0; for example, there is
no discussion of style sheets. It also doesn't give much space to
Netscape or Internet Explorer extensions. Deny it if you want, but
either of these two browsers is the likely tool of choice for the
majority of users. At a minimum, a table showing some of the
differences or browser-specific extensions would have been
useful.</p><p>Back on the good side, Shawn does an excellent job of
introducing and defining APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
Throughout the book, he first discusses a graphic library
interface, its API, and then follows with meaningful examples.
Well, most are meaningful. That biorhythm example in Chapter 6
seemed just a little too <span   class="emphasis"><em>Austin Powers</em></span> for my
taste. I lived in the 60's, and truly hate going back there.</p><p>Most chapters also include in-depth function references. This
is highly useful information and somewhat unexpected, considering
that each chapter starts with some straight, non-technical talk
about what to do with these libraries. Again, Shawn goes the extra
mile to provide the most useful technical information.</p><p>Two very good chapters are Chapter 5, &ldquo;Industrial Strength
Graphics Scripting with PerlMagic&rdquo; and Chapter 7, &ldquo;Web Graphics
with the GIMP&rdquo; (GNU Image Manipulation Program). The former is
extremely useful, even if you're not doing web graphics
specifically. It includes a very extensive description of the
PerlMagic interface to ImageMagic.</p><p>The GIMP chapter is too sparse for experts and too technical
for new users. However, it does provide information on the various
animation options, much of which I didn't know. The section on
Perl-Fu is good, but Perl-Fu requires Perl 5.005, which most Red
Hat 5.2 users don't have. (SuSE, Debian and other distributions may
have this&mdash;you need to run <b  >Perl -V</b> to find out.)
I find it a bit annoying that so many application-level tools make
requirements of libraries and low-level utilities not available
with standard distributions. This shouldn't be surprising with an
environment as young as Linux, but it is still annoying. Even so,
the Perl extension to the GIMP is a prize possession and shouldn't
be overlooked.</p><p>The Perl-Fu interface comes with several Perl modules. The
GIMP module allows access to plug-ins and filters via the standard
plug-in interface,
<span   class="bold"><b>gimp_run_procedure</b></span>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>GIMP::Fu</b></span> module abstracts this so
you call plug-ins by name. At least, this is the impression I got
after reading this chapter. Check out Appendix C, which is a very
good reference for writing Perl scripts for the GIMP.</p><p>The most confusing paragraph in the entire book came in the
chapter on the GIMP. Here, in a footnote, Shawn makes a valiant
attempt to explain the differences between plug-ins, script-fu
scripts and Perl scripts. It isn't an easy read, but it was a nice
try. I noticed one error in chapter 8, &ldquo;Image Maps&rdquo;, in reference
to the GIMP: there <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> an Image Map tool for
the GIMP now. I suspect the reason Shawn missed this is simply a
matter of timing. The Image Map plug-in probably arrived after
Shawn finished writing this book.</p><p>In general, the text makes a fairly poor attempt at being
platform-independent. Occasional references are made to
Microsoft-based tools, but many (perhaps most) of the tools
discussed are UNIX-specific. I think O'Reilly may have wanted this
more than Shawn did, but in either case, they probably should have
stuck with UNIX only.</p><p>The chapter on animation is good, discussing the topic from a
strictly programming perspective. Many of the techniques covered,
such as splitting an image, often work better using interactive
tools such as the GIMP. Nevertheless, much animation work is
repetitive, and having programming tools for this process obviously
helps. This chapter does a good job explaining the hows and whys of
animation programming from a web developer's point of view.</p><p>One thing I completely disagreed with was the suggestion in
chapter 10 of embedding ASCII art in HTML <b  >ALT</b>
tags. If you want to use ASCII art, as a convenience to users of
text-only browsers, set the <b  >ALT</b> tag to the
appropriate text and link the tag to a separate page containing the
ASCII art. Don't embed it in the <b  >ALT</b> tag. If you
do, you'll hate yourself later when you have to go back and edit
that HTML file by hand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7a580.0x1d73528"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Overall, I was quite impressed by Shawn's work on this
subject. My very few complaints are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Black and white images made it difficult to see
artifacts in side-by-side image format comparisons.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 2 gave Perl code first,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>then</em></span> mentioned modules described in later
chapters. I thought I'd missed something until I read past the
code.</p></li><li><p>Chapter 3 mentioned alignment with &ldquo;text flow&rdquo;
but did not define what that means. (It refers to alignment with
window edges, table or cell frames, and so forth.)</p></li></ul></div><p>These problems are minor and stood out only because I was
specifically doing a review. They don't distract from the main
purpose of the book, which is to guide developers in generating web
graphics programmatically. The real meat of the book&mdash;the in-depth
API descriptions&mdash;far outweighs any of the smaller issues.
</p><p>After reading the book, I must say I was initially
disappointed with the lack of reference to some tools, such as
WhirlGIF for animations. Then I thought more about the title of the
book and how it <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> mention &ldquo;GNU&rdquo;
specifically. If you live and breathe only GNU, this text is
perfect for you. If you are interested in GNU as well as other
options, it will fill only part of your needs. Still, it is a
fairly solid part, and definitely a great place to start when
learning to program web graphics on the fly.</p></div></div>
