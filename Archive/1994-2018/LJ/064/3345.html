    An attempt to solve the problem of network
    traffic congestion by adding a dynamic load-balancing feature to the
    existing DNS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0xcd88c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The rapid growth of computer literacy has
led to a dramatic rise in the number of people using computers
today. This rise has resulted in the development of intense
computation-oriented and resource-sharing applications. These
factors together play a prominent role in increasing the load
across the Internet, causing severe network traffic congestion.
This phenomenon, though dynamic in nature, causes a lot of user
frustration in the form of slow response times and repeated
crashing of applications.
</p><p>Developing servers with more capacity and capability of
handling this traffic is one way to solve the problem; another is
to distribute client requests across multiple servers. This second
method is an elegant way of handling this problem, since it uses
existing resources and avoids scenarios in which some servers are
overloaded while the rest of them are idle. The need for
distributing requests across servers is further strengthened,
considering:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Each TCP session eats up 32 bytes of memory (a
general rule of thumb), causing a server that has 32MB of RAM to
theoretically support one million simultaneous connections (see
Resources 2).</p></li><li><p>Given a number of servers, users always log in to
their favorite server while overlooking the load on that
server.</p></li></ul></div><p>Distributing a request across servers can be implemented by
monitoring the servers regularly and directing the request
dynamically to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>best server</em></span>. This way of
dynamically directing a request across multiple servers based on
the server load is called dynamic load balancing. This feature can
be added to the pre-existing Domain Name Service (DNS), as it
already plays a prominent role in resolving client requests and can
be configured to direct client requests across multiple servers in
an effort to avoid network traffic congestion. Here, <span   class="emphasis"><em>best
server</em></span> refers to the server with the best rating based
on a rating algorithm to be explained later.
</p><p><a href="3345s4.html" target="_self">Snapshots</a></p><p>We will explain the design, implementation and benefits of a
dynamic load-balancing DNS, dlbDNS, which extends DNS.</p><p><a href="3345s1.html" target="_self">Minimum Requirements for
dlbDNS</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0xcd8ea0"></a>Load-Balancing Models</h2></div></div><p>Four load-balancing models are available. First, RFC 1794
(see Resources 1) describes a load-balancing method using a special
zone transfer agent that obtains its information from external
sources. The new zone then gets loaded by the name server. One
problem with this method is that between zone transfers, the
weighted information is essentially static or possibly handed out
in a round-robin fashion. This method also doesn't allow a
virtual/dynamic domain where a response is created dynamically
based on the name being queried (see Resources 4).</p><p>The second model is a dedicated load-balancing server which
intercepts incoming requests and directs them to the best server.
This design employs virtual IP addresses for internal use by the
load-balancing server. One problem with this is it adds another
server to the existing cluster of servers to be monitored, instead
of utilizing the available resources.</p><p>A third model is a remote monitoring system that monitors the
performance of different servers and provides feedback to the DNS.
This design helps detect problems not visible internally, and
provides truer access time measurements and easy detection of
configuration errors that affect external users. The major problem
here is the dependency on the remote network to monitor and deliver
data (see Resources 5).</p><p>Last is an internal monitoring system that monitors the
performance of the servers and provides feedback to the DNS. Its
major advantages are easy maintainability and administration,
closeness to the source of addressable problems and no security
hazards (see Resources 5). This design is implemented in
dlbDNS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0xcd90b0"></a>Load-Balancing Algorithms</h2></div></div><p>Initially, load-balancing was intended to permit DNS agents
to support the concept of machine clusters (derived from the VMS
usage) where all machines were functionally similar or the same. It
didn't particularly matter which machine was picked, as long as the
processing load was reasonably well-distributed across a series of
actual different hosts. With servers of different configurations
and capacities, there is a need for more sophisticated algorithms
(see Resources 1).</p><p>&ldquo;Round-robin algorithm A&rdquo; can distribute requests in a
round-robin fashion evenly across servers. Although the requests
are handled dynamically, the problem is the total ignorance of
various performance characteristics.</p><p>&ldquo;Load-average algorithm A&rdquo; can distribute requests across
servers based on the server load. This design is very simple and
fairly inexpensive, but fails miserably if servers vary in
configuration and potential.</p><p>&ldquo;Rating algorithm A&rdquo; is based on the number of users and
load-average shown below. This algorithm is reasonable, as its
rating favors hosts with the smallest number of unique logins and
lower load averages (see Resources 4). This rating algorithm is
implemented in dlbDNS to determine the <span   class="emphasis"><em>best
server.</em></span></p><pre     class="programlisting">
WT_PER_USER    = 100
USER_PER_LOAD_UNIT = 3
FUDGE              = (TOT_USER - UNIQ_USER) * (WT_PER_USER/5)
WEIGHT             = (UNIQ_USER * WT_PER_USER) + (USER_PER_LOAD_UNIT * LOAD) + FUDGE
</pre><p>where the variables are
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >TOT_USER</b>: total number of users
logged in</p></li><li><p><b  >UNIQ_USERS</b>: unique number of
users logged in</p></li><li><p><b  >LOAD</b>: load average over the last
minute, multiplied by 100</p></li><li><p><b  >WT_PER_USER</b>: pseudo-weight per
user</p></li><li><p><b  >FUDGE</b>: fudge factor for users
logged in more than once</p></li><li><p><b  >WEIGHT</b>: rating of the
server</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0xcd9a50"></a>dlbDNS Implementation</h2></div></div><p>To get started, we downloaded BIND 8.1.2 from the Internet
Software Consortium
(<a href="http://www.isc.org/bind.html" target="_self">www.isc.org/bind.html</a>).
Initially, time was spent installing and understanding DNS. DNS was
installed on odie.cs.twsu.edu, a stand-alone Linux
workstation.</p><p><a href="3345l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
named.hosts.wsu</a></p><p>During configuration, a new attribute called DNAME was added
to distinguish the hosts taking part in dynamic load-balancing.
Listing 1 is a snapshot from named.hosts.wsu, containing
information on all hosts in a particular zone. In this listing, the
set of hosts kira.cs.twsu.edu, sisko.cs.twsu.edu and q.cs.twsu.edu
take part in dynamic load-balancing for
<a href="http://www1.cs.twsu.edu" target="_self">http://www1.cs.twsu.edu/</a>.
The set of hosts kira.cs.twsu.edu, mccoy.cs.twsu.edu and

Hosts kira.cs.twsu.edu and sisko.cs.twsu.edu belong to multiple
groups.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0x10d2010"></a>Server-Side Algorithm</h2></div></div><p>Here is the algorithm we added to the pre-existing DNS
feature. If the service requested is of type DNAME, do the
following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Determine the set of participating servers for this
service.</p></li><li><p>Request ratings from all participating servers by
establishing a concurrent connectionless (UDP) connection with each
server.</p></li><li><p>Using the ratings returned, determine the best
server.</p></li><li><p>Handle error conditions such as &ldquo;server is too
busy to return the rating within the time frame&rdquo;, &ldquo;the rating
returned by the server gets lost on its way back to the dlbDNS&rdquo;,
&ldquo;all servers have same rating&rdquo; and &ldquo;a server is down&rdquo;.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0x10d2430"></a>Rating Demon Algorithm</h2></div></div><p>A rating daemon runs on each server taking part in dynamic
load balancing. Here is the algorithm:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Receive request for rating from dlbDNS and respond
by returning the host rating.</p></li><li><p>Calculate the host rating once every minute rather
than calculating it at the time of request, as quick response time
is a most important feature.</p></li><li><p>Ensure the host rating is updated every minute,
independent of the dlbDNS request.</p></li><li><p>Handle error conditions such as dlbDNS closing the
UDP sockets without waiting for host response.</p></li></ol></div><p><a href="3345f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1. dlbDNS.gif</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0x10d2900"></a>Model</h2></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows the functionality of dlbDNS. The path traced
by C indicates the process of updating the server rating by the
rating daemons. The path traced by B indicates the communication
between dlbDNS and the rating daemons to determine the best server.
The path traced by A indicates the path traced by the user request.
HOST 1 has a better rating than the other two hosts, so the user
request gets directed to HOST 1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0x10d2a08"></a>dlbDNS Benefits</h2></div></div><p>Implementing dlbDNS provides efficient utilization of system
resources and ensures that facilities newly added to the existing
network will be utilized. Since DNS is used, applications such as
FTP and TELNET will also utilize dlbDNS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0x10d2b10"></a>dlbDNS Current Implementation</h2></div></div><p>Uneven distribution of load across servers has been a major
problem in the Computer Science department of Wichita State
University. bugs.cs.twsu.edu, kira.cs.twsu.edu, roger.cs.twsu.edu
and sisko.cs.twsu.edu are four Linux servers available for students
in the department. These servers vary in potential and
configuration.</p><p>dlbDNS was installed in December 1998 to effectively utilize
the servers. lion.cs.twsu.edu, the actual DNS server, was made to
direct DNAME requests toward odie.cs.twsu.edu where dlbDNS was
installed. The lines added to the configuration file were:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

bestlinux       IN      DNAME   bugs.cs.twsu.edu.
bestlinux       IN      DNAME   kira.cs.twsu.edu.
bestlinux       IN      DNAME   roger.cs.twsu.edu.
bestlinux       IN      DNAME   sisko.cs.twsu.edu.
;
</pre><p>Here, the <b  >bestlinux</b> attribute was added to
handle non-web requests from applications such as TELNET and FTP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe0580.0x10d2d78"></a>Future Work</h2></div></div><p>Currently, the <span   class="bold"><b>gethostbyname</b></span>
system call fails within the BIND code. This problem is avoided by
using a configuration file with a list of host and IP addresses.
We'd like to find a better solution.</p><p>The rating algorithm is still not complete. An algorithm that
takes into account the number of processors, CPU and memory
utilization would make the rating algorithm more efficient.</p><p>At this time, only Linux servers can take part in the dynamic
load-balancing scheme, as the rating algorithm uses files in the
/proc file structure. A more extensible design is needed.</p><p><a href="3345s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3345s3.html" target="_self">Acknowledgement</a></p></div></div>
