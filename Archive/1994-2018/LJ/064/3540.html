</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>iTux</b></span>: I envision a
Linux-based iMac. Call it an iTux (too bad, the domain is already
taken). Dress it up in those handsome penguin colors (or lack of
them), rather than the iMac's silly &ldquo;flavors&rdquo;. Use nothing but
end-of-life components with no fan and no floppy so it can be built
dirt cheap. Boot from the CD-ROM drive. Solder everything to the
boards including memory, with the possible exception of a
communications slot. Now we're talking about a black &amp; white
box: simple and reliable as an old phone. Shoot for a $500+ price
point, complete with all network connections, OS and software
including management agents. Put the money in memory and display,
which ought to be active matrix, if there's any way. Build two
classes: corporate and home. Skew cute for the home version and add
a slot for a Sony Playstation module. Message: for the price of a
Playstation, get a computer too.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Internet Floppies, Any Size</b></span>:
FTP and e-mail killed the floppy. Now it is time to unburden those
(social as well as technical) protocols. Let's create Internet
floppies. Create easily understood ways to create, share and manage
virtual Internet file servers of 10 to 100MB (or larger). This will
eliminate the need for virtual private networks, e-mail attachments
and complicated remote access routines. Any user should be able to
sign up for one with his or her ISP, then decide who else can use
it. Versions of this already exist at dedicated sites, such as
NetFloppy,
<a href="http://www.NetFloppy.com" target="_self">http://www.NetFloppy.com/</a>.
Why not at any site, any ISP, any business, using free and open
software?</p><p>ISPs would get stickier sites and happier customers.
Businesses would get turn-key field file-service solutions for
maybe $2 per user, instead of the $50-75 it might cost from a
file-service vendor. End users would get easy ways to pass files
around and back up hunks of their local directories.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1381580.0x1479450"></a>The Numbers</h2></div></div><p>Alexa Internet is best known for three things:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A neat little browser accessory that reveals stats,

sufficiently attractive that I am using them. This means I am
finally learning to use a mouse. I am actually using GnomeCard to
maintain my phone lists now. While regular users are learning Linux
command lines, I'm learning to point and click. What makes
GnomeCard interesting is that it has the characteristics of a good
point-and-click Roll-O-Dex, but on the backend it uses a straight
flat-text Vcard format. This means you're not locked in&mdash;you can
use it with other tools.  &mdash;Eric S. Raymond to Doc Searls, May

their c-tree Plus file handler, which includes the Crystal Reports
Driver to make ex-Windows users feel comfortable. File encryption
is available using algorithms that can be decrypted only by
FairCom's servers. The server includes an SDK (software development
kit) to allow developers to customize the encryption process,
resulting in an increased level of security. When talking to
Winston Atkinson of FairCom, I learned that System Development

production, manufacturing, distribution, data collection and
accounting. XLN supports Linux and is Y2K-compliant.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Metrowerks</b></span> is the
manufacturer of CodeWarrior, a developer tool package that now
supports Red Hat Linux. I talked to Jean B&eacute;langer, Chairman
and CEO, about why they chose to port to Linux, and he told me
management had initially turned down project requests for the port.
He said Metrowerks engineers did the port on their own and
presented it to management as an accomplished fact. Metrowerks is
so happy with this effort, they intend to port to other Linux
distributions in the near future. Most of the work had already been
done by the time they ported to Solaris over a year ago, but it was
still not easy, as CodeWarrior uses many system-level services. Mr.
B&eacute;langer said Metrowerks hopes to become the de facto
standard for developer tools on Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>SGI</b></span> has just released their

feels that Linux fits nicely into their high-end product offerings
and is a good match for clients who want innovative systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rebel.com</b></span> is the new name of
Hardware Canada Computing, the company that bought the NetWinder
from Corel Computing. They were at Linux Expo showing off the small

tools. The installer will include a knowledge database specific to
the needs of the ISV's software and the variables of the Linux

guys for seeing the need and stepping up to bat.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Digital Creations</b></span> introduced
their Zope Portal Toolkit. I saw a demonstration and was quite
impressed with its power and ease of use. It provides news, search,

Arthur Coston, President of AIS, who told me their first port to

the team at VA Linux Systems. He struck the deal with Larry
Augustin of VA Linux Systems during Spring Comdex. I talked to him
on June 8 while at the USENIX Conference in Monterey, CA. Jon is
actually a member of the USENIX board. The big question I asked was
why he is leaving Compaq. He gave me several answers. The bottom
line is because VA is a Linux company. If VA gives him a computer
for his home, that computer will be running Linux, so it will be
able to talk to the firewall and everything and his documents won't
be in Microsoft Word format.</p><p>Jon has worked for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for 16
years; DEC was bought by Compaq last year. At DEC, he worked as an
engineer, a marketing manager, a product manager and a Linux
evangelist. He went to DEC to help them create the best UNIX system
available, and he feels they have done that. Other people agree. He
also introduced DEC to Linux, and they are now selling Linux
systems.</p><p>Compaq has been selling servers without licenses for years,
and today many of those are Linux systems. One problem with
Compaq/DEC was a type of culture clash: whereas DEC sold thousands
of systems, Compaq sold millions. Thus, the sales techniques were
different all the way down to what could be given away at a trade
show. Also, his local boss has to approve him traveling to Texas to
talk to management; in other words, it's a big company with many
employees and all the red tape that goes with being big. Jon will
find a much more relaxed easier to deal with.</p><p>Working for VA will give Jon the opportunity to do the two
things he wants to do on a full-time basis: evangelize Linux and
put more time and effort into making Linux International a bigger
and better organization. That is, he wants to create a real board
of directors for Linux International, get the charter finished and
get every company possible involved in it. One way for Linux
International to do that is by initiating projects to which both
big and small companies can contribute. Basically, get everyone
involved in fun things, e.g., workshops. In other words, grow Linux
International and give it a higher degree of visibility.</p><p>Larry has basically agreed that Jon's job will be
evangelizing Linux and fixing Linux International. For the moment,
at least, Jon will continue to live in New Hampshire; VA is based
in Silicon Valley.</p><p>&mdash;Phil Hughes</p></div></div>
