IGEL LLC
(<a href="http://www.igelusa.com" target="_self">http://www.igelusa.com/</a>)
and owns a 10 percent interest in the company. He was born in
Germany and moved to the U.S. in 1993 to head up IGEL, founded in
1992. He holds an engineering degree in Computer Science and a
degree in Physics and Electronics. Before moving to the U.S., he
was VP of Germany's second largest PC network and UNIX support
company. He also owned a consulting company which specialized in
small business computing. I interviewed him via e-mail in mid-May.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: When did you start
up IGEL? Tell us a bit of the company's history.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: The company was
founded in October of 1992 by the same partners who owned and still
partially own IGEL GmbH
(<a href="http://www.igel.com" target="_self">http://www.igel.com/</a>) in
Germany. IGEL started out as a distributor for a SCO UNIX
Multi-Console Solution. In 1992, IGEL realized the limitations of
this technology and developed the first character-based Ethernet
TCP/IP terminal. The product, Etherminal 2C, was released in 1993.
The successors of Etherminal 2C, Etherminal C and N are still
selling today, creating a substantial part of IGEL's revenue. In
1993 IGEL developed the first (Flash-) Linux-based workstation,
Etherminal 3X. IGEL actually invented the thin-client concept. This
product had the same concept and basic functionality of our current
Etherminal thin-client product line. In 1996, IGEL developed the
Linux boot driver to boot Linux from an M-System's DiskOnChip (DOC)
Flash Memory. The driver has been released under the GPL to the
Linux community and can be downloaded from M-System's
server.</p><p>IGEL developed a compression technology to compress a
complete Linux system, including Netscape Communicator, into as
little flash memory as possible. This resulted in IGEL's first
commercially available thin client, which was released in 1998. In
mid-1998, IGEL added support for the Citrix Metaframe. RDP support
for the Microsoft Terminal Server will be available sometime in
July.</p><p>The next and final step was the development of a read-only
flash Linux file system. The development of these core technologies
resulted in a new Linux-based embedded OS which is named IGEL JNT.
IGEL JNT, besides being the OS for IGEL's thin clients, is
available to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) for licensing.
JNT is used for TV Internet set-top boxes, OEM thin clients,
network appliances, Linux/UNIX workstations and embedded computer
systems for industrial and residential applications.</p><p>In 1999, IGEL released a JNT system builder kit which again
can be licensed by OEMs, allowing them to develop their own
embedded Linux devices or modify our thin clients to accommodate
the OEM's proprietary application. IGEL, of course, does not charge
any licensing fees for the actual Linux part, only for the
compression technology, the read-only file system and the system
builder kit.</p><p>Currently established OEM partnerships include Siemens,
Schneider Cybermind, VxL and Mercedes Chrysler. With over 240,000
JNT units sold within the last 12 months, IGEL is becoming the
leader in thin-client computing.</p><p>In 1998, IGEL GmbH Germany sold 51 percent of its company to
Germany's largest Internet technology company, Infomatec. IGEL GmbH
also became a 90 percent owner of IGEL LLC (USA), while 10 percent
of IGEL LLC's ownership has been transferred to me. The
consolidation of Infomatec and IGEL provides a solid base for the
new partnership to push IGEL's JNT even further, setting a standard
for non-Windows-CE-based thin clients. The new partnership also
lays the groundwork to take IGEL public in 2001.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Why did you choose
Linux as your installed operating system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: Linux is one of the
most flexible open-source operating systems on the market. It is
incredibly stable and performant (no matter what certain benchmarks
insinuate). It is the most flexible OS on the market, and if your
readers follow IGEL's developments, they will soon be able to enjoy
incredible new JNT-based products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: The Etherminal looks
just as &ldquo;sexy&rdquo; as the Netwinder. In what way is it different? How
is it better?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: IGEL's Etherminal
series is a completely different &ldquo;animal&rdquo; than the Netwinder. It
targets a different market and comes with a much more powerful set
of functions and connectivity options. Etherminals do not have or
need any hard drive or other mechanical storage device, and are
based on legacy PC-compatible technology. The flexible hardware and
software concept allows IGEL to react to the increasing demand for
processing power in workstations and thin clients within a very
short time, giving IGEL a tremendous advantage in time to market.
The read-only file system protects the systems resources, making
Etherminal thin clients the most safe and secure desktop clients
for server-centric computing on the market. Etherminals and their
JNT OS are an ideal base for OEMs to start development for almost
any kind of dedicated embedded Linux network device. We at IGEL do
not see competitors as our enemies, but as an opportunity to
license our Etherminal and JNT technology to them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Tell us about your
product line; how these machines can be used, and who your
potential customers are.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: As of today, IGEL
offers three thin-client devices. Two of them are based on the same
hardware, while the third one is based on more up-scale
hardware.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Etherminal W</b></span> is a JNT-based
thin client to be used as a Citrix Metaframe ICA client, UNIX
workstation or a character-based network terminal. It supports
XDMCP, DHCP, ICA 3 and remote command
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span>. It is completely
self-booting, and therefore does not require a bootp server. It is
centrally managed and configured. The hardware is based on a Media
GXi 180MHz processor and is equipped with 16MB of RAM, 8MB DOC
flash memory, sound and 4MB of video memory.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Etherminal J</b></span> comes with the
same set of functionality, but adds an embedded Netscape
Communicator 4.5 with all the bells and whistles, including
Netscape's JVM. The local Netscape is ideal for saving network
bandwidth and eliminates the restrictions of 256 colors in an ICA
session while browsing the Internet. It also allows Java
applications to be run locally. On the hardware side, the unit
comes with 32MB of RAM and 16MB of DOC flash memory.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Etherminal J+</b></span> comes with the
same feature set as Etherminal J, also including the local Netscape
Communicator 4.5 and JVM. The hardware is based on a socket 7
design to accommodate processors from 100MHz (Intel Pentium is
default) to 300MHz (AMD K6). RAM size is 64MB and DOC flash memory
is 16MB.</p><p>While Etherminal W and J come with an integrated power
supply, Etherminal J+ has an external power supply which eliminates
the need for a power supply fan to cool the device. The form factor
benefits from this design as well&mdash;the unit takes up less than 50
percent of the real estate than that of an Etherminal W or
J.</p><p>IGEL is currently porting Windows NT Terminal Server's RDP to
Linux. Once available, it will be integrated as an additional
client protocol into all of IGEL's thin clients. The RDP client
will then be distributed under the GPL. IGEL is also a partner in
Citrix.</p><p>Typical end-user applications are POS, Citrix Metaframe and
Winframe ICA terminal, WTS terminals, web surfing, UNIX
workstations and Linux workstations. Since IGEL is selling through
the traditional computer reseller channel, any distributor,
reseller, VAR, ISP or ASP is a potential customer. Of course, we
have special conditions for government and educational
institutions.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thin clients
certainly seem to be popular at the moment. Has business been
increasing along with the rise in Linux popularity?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: I believe it is
actually the other way around. Thin client deployments seem to
benefit Linux as a desktop OS and hopefully in the future as a
enterprise server as well. Of course, the increasing popularity of
Linux has helped us to justify using it as our development
platform.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you expect the
upward trend to continue? For how long?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: I have been a firm
believer for many years that the server-centric computing model is
the best way to get the masses to use a computer. It is certainly
the most economical way to distribute computing power and
applications to the end user.</p><p>The client/server model never fulfilled its promises when it
comes to productivity issues, low TCO and more effective work
environments. Client/server deployments in big corporations create
support and help desk nightmares and lead to productivity problems.
It even produced legal nightmares due to end users infiltrating
corporate networks with unauthorized software. PCs on every user
desk, regardless of his or her job function, is in many cases a
very costly overkill. It creates huge problems with security and
virus issues if end users have too much freedom in what they use or
bring into corporate networks.</p><p>Today's thin-client technology marries the advantages of
server-centric computing and PC computing without the disadvantages
of the old mainframe technology. It opens up new opportunities for
ASPs and ISPs alike to work together to get the applications to the
end user. Linux can play a very vital role in this new computing
model, but it desperately needs productivity applications to put a
real dent into the current Windows-ruled desktop world. I believe
thin-client computing in whatever shape or form will stay around
for a very long time to come, and I hope Linux will play an
increasing role in this server-centric computing model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Any parting
thoughts?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Hans</b></span>: Linux and its
open-source movement is the right way to go, and I foresee a very
bright future for this operating system. Today's computing world
desperately needs innovation&mdash;something we don't get any more from
current software and hardware vendors. How else can it be explained
that we still have to live with an over 20-year-old outdated PC
hardware concept and outdated bloated software technology? I
personally believe Linux has the potential to become a major player
and make big changes in the way we will be computing in the future.
What Linux has achieved within a few years is a hint as to what is
possible in the future. <i  >Linux Journal</i>
certainly plays an important role in the development of this new
opportunity.</p><p>We at IGEL appreciate the continuous support of your
publication. <i  >Linux Journal</i> plays an important
role in our efforts to communicate our message to both the Linux
and thin-client worlds.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thanks very much for
