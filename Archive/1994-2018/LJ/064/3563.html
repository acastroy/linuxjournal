distribution, a professional, productivity-oriented package that is
highly functional, stable, secure, and especially easy to install
and administer. OpenLinux comes with a number of productivity
packages including Corel's WordPerfect 8 and StarOffice v.5, along
with the typical Linux utilities and applications (even games)
which are all incorporated into the menuing system of the K Desktop
Environment. Also included is the Caldera Open Administration
System (COAS), which is an easy-to-use graphical interface for
dealing with configuration and administration issues (similar to a
Control Panel on the Macintosh, but aimed at network
administration).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260e580.0x2706978"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>OpenLinux 2.2 is installed from an autobooting CD-ROM by way
of Caldera's graphical installation program Lizard (Linux Wizard,
that is). Provided your computer has a CD-ROM drive, autobooting
from the CD-ROM is achieved by pressing <b  >delete</b>
during startup and selecting the CD-ROM drive as the first boot
device, or you can start up the installation program from within
the particular OS which comes by default on most PCs (MS Windows).
OpenLinux's installation CD boots immediately to the graphical
interface, which <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> actually easy to use. Once
the Caldera graphic comes up (dancing people on part of a globe,
presumably happy because Linux installation is so easy), Lizard
will present a boot prompt, and if nothing is typed, will begin
probing the hardware. Lizard's probing techniques are fairly
thorough and if they do cause the computer to hang (with the
diversity of hardware available, problems are bound to come up on
some systems), typing <b  >install er=cautious</b> at the
boot prompt will tune down the probing and the installation should
continue smoothly.</p><p>The graphical installation process, once begun, is extremely
simple and consists of a few questions and answers. The first
question is which language you would like your installation
instructions in; the choices are English, German, French and
Italian. Strangely, Lizard will not let you change your mind on
this subject, so one is advised to be truthful. Once the language
is chosen, Lizard configures the mouse; the mouse should work with
the settings derived from Lizard's probe, and changes to the
configuration could cause a malfunctioning pointer.</p><p>Lizard presents several partition options: entire hard disk,
prepared partitions and custom. The first option simply prepares
the entire hard disk for use with Linux; the second is used for
situations in which one has already partitioned a drive for Linux.
The final partition option is for &ldquo;experts only&rdquo; and is what the
typical Linux user is used to: manual editing of partition
information (gasp). All of this is quite simple. The only problem I
noticed was that Lizard would sometimes ignore my swap partition,
and I would have to go back and declare my swap partition again
(just a simple back-and-forth clicking, like on a web browser).
According to the documentation if you boot from Windows,
PartitionMagic is invoked automatically to build the partitions for
you. Once the partitions are formatted, selection of installation
packages is made.</p><p>Unlike many Linux distributions, Caldera OpenLinux does not
require a user to spend time picking and choosing particular
packages. Four installation options are offered: minimal (server),
recommended, recommended plus commercial (including WordPerfect and
Star Office) and complete install (over one gigabyte of Linux
software). I tried all four sizes, and I recommend one of the
latter two, preferably the complete install if you have the
space.</p><p>A clever technique of Lizard is that installation of packages
proceeds while the user is still answering questions and
configuring the system. Right after package selection has begun,
the questions on keyboard layout, video card, monitor and
networking are raised. Keyboard layout is just a typical
straightforward selection (although &ldquo;Finnish&rdquo; is misspelled as
&ldquo;Finish&rdquo;). The video card selection offers a probe function,
which I recommend. On the test machine, Lizard correctly diagnosed
the video card, while the probe discovered the correct amount of
video memory. Monitor selection consists of choosing among over
1,700 monitors from a database. Obviously, some monitors may be
missing from the list, but any monitor which is agreeable to VESA
standards should be easily configured.</p><p>After the monitor has been selected, Lizard shows possible
resolutions for running the X Window System and KDE. To test a
particular resolution, simply select the resolution and click the
<b  >test</b> button. One difficulty I had is that Lizard
showed a KDE screen instead of the standard X test pattern, which
made it difficult to tell if I had a <span   class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span>
setting. Still, it is quite an easy procedure: point and click
until the test screen looks right.</p><p>Finally, just set the root password, add a few users, perhaps
configure networking, and then all is ready to go!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260e580.0x2706e48"></a>OpenLinux and the K Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p>Caldera selected the K Desktop Environment as the interface
of choice for its distribution, and upon startup, OpenLinux
launches right into it. If you feel uninclined to type in your user
name, pointing and clicking from a list of users is an option
(regular users' icons are just heads, but root gets to be a
conductor). However, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have to type in
your own password&mdash;there is no point-and-click solution to this
problem (yet).</p><p>The first login from any user will bring up KDE's
configuration program, which asks a few questions as to which theme
and icons the user would like. There are some typical KDE themes
from which to choose (KDE default, Macintosh OS, BeOS and Windows).
As for icons, you can choose floppies, CD-ROM, printer and even a
Caldera Systems icon for your desktop, linking you to their home
page, if you are really enthusiastic about Caldera or think you'll
be needing technical support. One mysterious issue of this icon
selection is that unless you move the configuration window, you
will not see any icons appearing on the desktop, but that is the
only problem I found with KDE.</p><p>Caldera clearly put a lot of effort into their particular
configuration for KDE, because the menuing system is neatly
organized and includes a great many applications, utilities,
networking software and other programs (even games). It is quite
impressive to click on the K icon (&ldquo;Where do you want to go
tomorrow?&rdquo; it asks) and see everything laid out so clearly,
without having to do any manual configuration. In fact, the sight
of such a selection of productivity, networking and development
software all configured and ready to go on one system could be one
of the most persuasive arguments in favor of running Linux in a
business environment; that is, when we try to convince non-Linux
users to give our OS a chance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260e580.0x2707058"></a>Caldera Open Administration System</h2></div></div><p>For some reason, an aversion to shells and text-based
interfaces has developed among modern computer users; the
preference is for GUIs these days. COAS is Caldera's solution for
network administrators who prefer a graphical approach. COAS is an
interface for dealing with issues of network administration and is
set up so as to keep track of administration changes in such a way
that one can use COAS when one chooses and traditional Linux
commands when one is so inclined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260e580.0x2707160"></a>Issues</h2></div></div><p>Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 is very close to requiring minimal
technical knowledge; however, some problems can arise. The first is
that LILO (Linux Loader) often has trouble installing on partitions
with more than 1024 cylinders. This is easily remedied by appending
<b  >linear</b> to the general section of the
/etc/lilo.conf file, but since one might expect most modern hard
drives to have more than 1024 cylinders, it seems strange that
Caldera did not automate the accommodation for this problem. Still,
I had some trouble making a successful coexistence with the BeOS.
The other problem is that because OpenLinux 2.2 aims to be secure,
authority issues can arise when trying to restart X and KDE after
one has shut down the windowing system which comes up at startup.
When a user logs into a console, the greeting message says to type
<b  >startx</b> or <b  >kde</b>. Neither of
these commands was functional on the test machine except for root,
and then only after I made changes to the .xsessionrc file. In a
business environment, this could be confusing, though the solution
may simply be to reboot. Also, StarOffice must be configured before
it can be run, which could pose difficulties for certain people.
Finally, for some reason, Caldera did not include the immortal
editor <span   class="bold"><b>pico</b></span>--I had to boot up
Emacs all the time. I am <span   class="emphasis"><em>sure</em></span> there is a
simple remedy for this problem.</p><p>As far as being up to date, OpenLinux 2.2 runs on the Linux
kernel 2.2.5. The 2.2 kernel is a fantastic production and is
especially improved in the areas of networking, interoperability
with other operating/file systems, parallel processing, backup and
RAID and hardware support, things which are especially important in
a professional environment. Also, the OpenLinux 2.2 distribution is
up to date on its numerous libraries, while maintaining backwards
compatibility for glibc 5-based applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260e580.0x2707478"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>One of the only arguments supporters of Microsoft could make
against Linux is that consumers would not use Linux because they
want total product accountability from one particular firm (in
essence, users of free software would have no one to call for
support). However, Caldera stands behind its product with a
90-day/five-incident warranty and keeps a database of potential
bugs and fixes on its web site. Support forms are available
on-line, in case one has a problem without a readily visible
solution, and Caldera is relatively quick to respond. For
businesses and individuals who cannot wait for technical support,
there is a full 24x7 fee-based support system with guaranteed
one-hour response. Also, Caldera insists it is working to ensure
Y2K compliance, though Linux users have traditionally not been very
concerned about this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x260e580.0x2707580"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>OpenLinux 2.2 is designed specifically for the business
community, and although it would be quite good for
productivity-minded home users, it is highly tuned for business
use. Businesses should find everything they need right here,
including single-party accountability for technical support. The
system appears rather secure, and passwords are shadowed. Also, I
noticed I could not log in as root via TELNET (which is good for
security).</p><p>Ultimately, this distribution is evidence of how easy Linux
can be to install, and how commercially and professionally viable
it is. Home users who like to hack might prefer another
distribution, but for businesses, this appears to be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> solution.</p></div></div>
