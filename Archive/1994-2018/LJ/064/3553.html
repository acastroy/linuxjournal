    Getting off the showroom floor turned out to be the real
    trick, as we were often stopped by people wanting to shake his hand,
    ask him a question or just tell him how wonderful Red Hat is.

22 at Linux Expo. He met me at the <i  >Linux Journal</i> booth, and we walked to a quiet place in a
nearby plaza. Getting off the showroom floor turned out to be the
real trick, as we were often stopped by people wanting to shake his
hand, ask him a question or just tell him how wonderful Red Hat is.
Even during the interview, we were &ldquo;found&rdquo; by one fan who sat
quietly and listened until we finished and then jumped up to shake
Bob's hand.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you have any
numbers on the show?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: No, I don't; you'll
have to check with Lisa Sullivan. I actually just arrived at the
show; I believe we are doing pretty well.</p><p>Our goal, of course, was to keep up our trend, which is to
double the show every year. In 1995 at North Carolina State, we had
about 200 people; the next year we had about 400 people, again at
NC State. This actually wasn't &ldquo;we&rdquo; at this point, but a couple
of students. Red Hat sponsored it in 1997 at the Biotech Center,
and about 900 people came. Last year, the show was held at Duke
University and we had about 2000 attendees. So our goal for this
year was to attract 4000 people to the show. As of Thursday noon
(after the first day of the show), we were at 3000 people. Given
that most of the attendees come for the first day of the show, that
was probably the bulk. This number does not include vendors or
speakers. I think we are well on track to making 4000, but we'll
have to wait to actually see what the numbers are.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: It certainly looks
like 4000. [Final count was 3600.]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Oh, good! It's a great
show. One of the things I've been noticing is everyone seems to be
coming every day.</p><p>I've seen a good number of people in the exhibit hall on
multiple days&mdash;normally, people do the exhibits in the morning,
then are done&mdash;just coming back to the conferences. But these
people are spending a great deal of time with each and every
booth.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That's good to hear.
Are you going to keep the goal of doubling each year?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Absolutely&mdash;if not
faster! I love to quote Linus' line whenever anyone asks him about
the future of Linux: &ldquo;World domination and fast!&rdquo; While we may be
pleased with the success of 4000 people, it isn't quite world
domination.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3553f2.jpg"></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: 8000 next year&mdash;good
luck on making it. There have been a couple of incidents that
people are talking about. One is the Pacific HiTech t-shirt
give-away. Giving out t-shirts is not allowed? I heard they were
run off.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Yeah, this is just show
management issues. You'd have to check with Stacy, who is running
the show, for more detail. Typically, for vendors to attend a trade
show, they buy booths. Vendors who try to sneak into a trade show
without buying a booth in order to get the benefit of the trade
show&mdash;well, whether you go to COMDEX or any of the other shows,
you'll be run off pretty quickly if you try to get the benefits of
the trade show without contributing to the cost of putting it
on.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That makes
sense&mdash;how about the poster for LinuxCare?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: That's a funny story,
but one we take very seriously. In the end, the only thing Red Hat
owns are our trademarks&mdash;we don't own any intellectual property&mdash;so
we have to defend our trademarks very carefully because we can't
afford to have them end up in the public domain. Legally, if you
don't protect your trademark, you can lose it. We were very
surprised by LinuxCare's cavalier attitude. It's one thing to do a
parody of someone's advertisement, which the poster was&mdash;a parody
of the Palm Pilot ad. But it's sort of odd to use a third company's
product in that parody. If LinuxCare had put a LinuxCare logo in
the woman's hands, that would have been different. But to use our
product without our permission as a parody of a Palm Pilot
advertisement&mdash;well, we were just very surprised they didn't talk
to us about it beforehand.</p><p>We have a second problem in that Linux users are 99 percent
male. The Linux community has not been perceived as a very
welcoming community to the other 50 percent of the population. To
do a parody that takes an artistic nude from the Palm Pilot ad and
turns it into a sexual nude just makes it seem we are going in the
wrong direction.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I truly agree with
you on that one. I went by the LinuxCare booth before y'all asked
them to remove it. I saw it and told them I found it
offensive.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Well, thank you. It was
Lisa Sullivan, our marketing director, who saw it and said, &ldquo;What
are these people thinking?&rdquo; She went over privately to ask them to
stop passing it out because it was sufficiently offensive and
tacky, and on top of everything else, it infringed on other
people's trademarks. They chose to ask her to talk to their lawyers
instead of just complying with the request&mdash;so we did. And that's
where the story came from.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That's amazing&mdash;I do
hate seeing lawyers called. Matthew Cunningham, my cohort here,
took a tour of your building and was very impressed. He wanted me
to ask you how you decided to use cubicles instead of private
offices.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3553f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Mr. Young's cubicle, where it all happens
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: We actually used
private offices in the past. We started with a very open plan; mind
you, this was back when we had no money. We couldn't afford
cubicles or offices; we just had folding tables. When we moved into
our first facility in December 1997, we decided it would be much
more efficient if we could close doors and concentrate on the work
at hand, so that's the route we went. After working in that
environment for a year, we recognized something: while there is a
downside to both models, the open space has the one advantage of
enabling communication. It's so critically important in our
business&mdash;in any business that's evolving as quickly as both Red
Hat and the whole Open Source movement. We are willing to put up
with the distraction of interruptions and noise and everything else
you get in an open space in order to focus on the primary benefit,
which is the instantaneous communication you can get if you don't
have offices.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Matthew was
particularly impressed that you have a cubicle yourself.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: I'm the one who gets
cut off the fastest from the information flow around the business.
I think it is doubly important that I'm sitting in a
cubicle!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What's going on with
6.0? What's new?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: There are many new
things in 6.0. My job isn't so much to make products anymore or
come to trade shows and sell them&mdash;my job is worrying about the
health of the business five years from now. That's why 6.0, as far
as I'm concerned, is so important. When you look at the health of
Red Hat, you have to worry about the health of the Open Source
movement in general.</p><p>With 6.0, and I presume it's true for Caldera's and SuSE's
and Debian's and Slackware's builds of the Linux operating system,
the acceleration in development of this Open Source community had
to be considered. What's been happening is we've been getting teams
from SAP doing Linux kernel work because they want a faster, better
OS for running their application engine. Just recently&mdash;this hasn't
had an impact in any Linux products yet&mdash;SGI released their XFS
journaling file system, which is a world-class piece of technology,
as Open Source. This is indicative not only of the fact that the
open-source development model is working, but also that it is
actually accelerating.</p><p>In the 2.2 kernel, we are seeing things like the Linux
Graphical Network Management tools that compete very effectively
with the best management tools you'll find in any of the other UNIX
systems, or for that matter, in NT. Of course, we are also getting
all the client-side tools, now that we've got both the GNOME and
KDE projects rapidly moving forward. The GTK toolkit has become a
standard. Netscape reporting all Mozilla code means moving
Navigator and Communicator over from Motif to the GTK library. Of
course, we already have the GIMP for which GTK was named, and
AbiSource is building their word processors against GTK. The GTK
libraries, which are under the LGPL, are very exciting because if
the client is going to succeed, we have to be able to support
graphical applications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Each year, Red Hat
has gotten easier to install. Now Caldera has their new Lizard
install that's really just insert the CD and have it do all the
work. Have y'all put in the same sort of easy install that they
have?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: We are very impressed
with Caldera's Lizard-thing&mdash;it's very slick. It has received some
very good reviews. We do have certain concerns with our install in
terms of going in that direction. Among others, there is always
going to be some hardware that is not supported, so you need to be
able to back up when you run into a problem. If we build a
graphical front end, we want to make sure that during the
installation process, you can back up. That aside, you can be
assured we are working on a graphical front end to the installation
tool set. We also want an open-source one.</p><p>We are very interested in what Bodo Bauer is doing with his
open-source install shield for his new company, Zenguin. That looks
like a very interesting project. I think on the installation side,
there is going to be a ton of very rapid advances. This is what is
so powerful about this community approach. This is where Caldera is
presenting huge value. If it wasn't for Caldera's Lizard install,
we might go off and work on something else instead. But with
someone pushing us, we're going to have to leapfrog back and come
up with a new set of technology. It's that competition in the
marketplace that's causing the Linux open-source-based technology
to innovate faster than you've seen in the proprietary OS
technologies coming out of Microsoft&mdash;no one is pushing
Microsoft.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Well, hopefully
Linux is pushing them now!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: I suspect you'll see a
little more innovation out of Microsoft now.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Okay, Red Hat has
all the big guys giving them venture capital. How did you manage
that? Did you go looking for them?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Yes, we refer to it as
&ldquo;Elephant Hunting&rdquo;. We went looking for them for a particular
reason. In January of 1998, we won InfoWorld's product of the year
award for the second year in a row. The first year, we tied with
NT; in 1998, they gave it to us outright. We could have been
flattered and sat back and said, &ldquo;Wow, that's pretty cool.&rdquo; Our
reaction was &ldquo;Houston, we have a problem.&rdquo; The problem was this:
Linux was winning awards everywhere&mdash;SuSE in Germany, us in many
other marketplaces with many other journalists, and the Apache
technology was winning&mdash;yet the MIS directors we were talking to
were choosing NT anyway, because the MIS directors are looking five
years ahead. When they adopt new technology, they have to worry
about the investment they have to make in that technology in terms
of training and implementation, and they have to worry about
getting a five-year life out of it. With the open-source
technologies coming from the small companies, they are saying,
&ldquo;Let's see, I can work with a bunch of guys down in the tobacco
fields in North Carolina or I can work with the world's most
profitable software company, that being Microsoft&rdquo; and making the
easy decision.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3553f8.jpg"></div><p>The problem is, even if Red Hat doubled in size or even
became ten times bigger, we would still be way too small for an MIS
director at Ford Motor Company to trust our technology. So we
realized the only way around that problem was to get the
endorsement of the industry leading players. So that by first
getting into Netscape and more recently getting Compaq, Dell and
IBM involved, you now have people like Michael Prince at Burlington
Coat Factory deploying 1200 Linux boxes he got from Dell, because
he could rely on Dell five years from now. So while Red Hat may not
be around in five years, clearly Dell Corporation will be.</p><p>That was the whole point to it, getting the big ISVs&mdash;the
Oracles and SAPS on board. Netscape indicated to the ISV community
that this was serious technology, and despite the fact that it
looks more like the Internet in terms of not being a controlled
technology, it nonetheless is a very powerful technology model and
has very effective means for ISVs to deploy their technology on
these operating systems that are being built on the Linux
kernel.</p><p>As a result, it's all in the interest of sending the right
message both to the ISVs (the industry) as well as to the
users&mdash;that this stuff is ready to be used. I think we are
beginning to see that, in terms of the interest of the industry and
the world at large and what we are all trying to do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How much are you
participating in the Linux Standards Base?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: We are hugely
supportive of standards! If you go to the LSB mailing list, you'll
find many Red Hat engineers very actively involved. When Dan
Quinlan is quoted on this subject, his quotes always seems to have
a big question mark in the middle&mdash;why are you asking me about
this?&mdash;because he knows that Erik Troan and Christian Gafton and
all our lead engineers are very actively working with him to build
the LSB. Yet, we seem to be criticized in the press for not
supporting the LSB.</p><p>There is only one place where I think we are possibly
vulnerable to that criticism and it is unfair criticism. We come
out of the Linux world, and one of the big attractions to the Linux
world is that you publish all your source code&mdash;you publish early
and you publish often, as Eric Raymond says. Thus, everything you
do is in the public space; you are living in a fishbowl. You don't
have the opportunity to do vaporware-type announcements, and we
don't. So even when it comes to standards efforts, we don't want
the world to think Linux is going to fail, unless a standards body
like the LSB succeeds; in other words, what if, for whatever
reasons&mdash;lack of support by other teams or a standard that is not
implementable&mdash;it fails? Suddenly everybody writes off Linux,
saying &ldquo;Oh, they couldn't get their act together and do a
standard.&rdquo; We're interested in seeing that standard in place, but
we're not willing to bet the future on it. We're going to work very
hard, harder than anyone else to make sure of that standard; Red
Hat has always adopted things like the Linux file system standards.
Everything the Linux community tells us is going to become the
standard. glibc was going to become the standard, so we adopted it
very aggressively. Then we were getting criticized for adopting
glibc, but we were thinking, &ldquo;Hold on, the whole development
community is telling us the future of the technology is glibc.&rdquo; So
you get into a lot of this kind of stuff where we are very focused
on staying very close to the development communities. As such, we
will not use the media to promote projects or technologies that are
not yet real. Just because that's what Microsoft does, and people
are so fed up with it that I don't think any of us should go
there.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3553f4.jpg"></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I agree; I was in
programming long enough to know that vaporware isn't a good idea.
When Standards do get put in place, how do you think distributions
will be able to stay separate?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: It depends on what
you're trying to do with Standards. We think Dan Quinlan is going
in exactly the right direction. This goes back to the Swiss stock
exchange and the MIS director to whom I was talking. He asked me
specifically, very pointedly, the question of how do you avoid the
standards trap? That is, if you define your standards too narrowly,
you limit innovation, because suddenly every player in the industry
has to go back to a 30-member standards committee to ask permission
to deploy another piece of technology. You must define your
standard clearly so that it delivers specific benefits and defines
the framework that allows the various Linux engineering teams to
build better and better operating systems out of the kernel, and
the X Window System and all the pieces that come out of this Open
Source community. We define it broadly enough so that the developer
is not limited in the innovation he brings to it; then we get the
best of both worlds. If we define the Standard badly, so that it's
not implementable because it doesn't enable the technology to
evolve forward, then all we have successfully done is handed the
future of the operating system space back to Microsoft.</p><p>So that's the balance and that's why we're saying we're going
to support this&mdash;we want to see it done properly. But there is the
risk, and Dan Quinlan will admit to it, that this thing might not
work, and if it doesn't work, we will continue to work very closely
through Linux International with &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; and everyone else to
ensure communication keeps working so our users get the benefit. As
I put it, using a car analogy, you need only a single driver's
license to drive any kind of car from a BMW to a Hyundai. That is
what we want to ensure&mdash;that you need only one driver's license to
drive any version of Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: You have had a lot
of partner announcements, and people have products coming out
ported just to Red Hat Linux. Many people are afraid that this is
going to cause Red Hat to become the Microsoft of the Linux world.
Do you think that is going to happen?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: No. Here's why. We
don't do any exclusive contracts. For example, the guys at
Metrowerks&mdash;on their box, they say it was built for Red Hat Linux.
That wasn't our idea&mdash;that was their idea for marketing purposes.
They recognized, with the partnerships we've been making, that they
wanted access to our marketing channels and to send a message to
our users that this product was specifically targeted for them. I
suspect they will do Code Warrior for Caldera and Pacific HiTech
and any other distribution that achieves a decent market size. ISVs
are porting to Linux now only because they perceive there are a lot
of Linux users. For example, our goal at Red Hat has always been to
expand the number of Linux users, not to dominate the Linux space.
When we started, Slackware had half a million users&mdash;95 percent of
Linux users at that time. Today, they have a much smaller market
share, probably a million users. Slackware has in fact doubled
their number of users in the period we've been around. So we
haven't done a particularly good job at squashing our competition!
And we have no interest in doing that. Slackware and Caldera and
Debian are very much our allies in this effort to make Open Source
the definition, to make Open Source a required feature of any
operating system the user might consider. If we can do that, we
have a real shot at displacing the proprietary binary-only
operating systems, whether they are from Microsoft or Apple or
other UNIX vendors or IBM.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3553f7.jpg"></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I talked to
Metrowerks on Thursday, and Mr. B&eacute;langer said they are
talking to other people.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Of course they would,
because they would be foolish not to. It's as simple as running
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> to rebuild it, even if the
market they are trying to build it for is, for example, using an
older C library. Most of us are using the same C libraries these
days, so the stuff probably runs. I don't know this for certain;
you'll have to check with the Metrowerks guys, but I suspect it
runs on the other distributions just fine.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: They didn't tell me
that, just that they would be talking to others. I was talking to
Clay Claiborne, a Red Hat reseller, and he told me that Best Buy
sells Red Hat for $65 while he has to pay $69.95 for it. How does
that kind of pricing work&mdash;that companies like Linux Mall and Frank
Kasper are charged a higher price than Best Buy?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: It's a real challenge
for us. According to U.S. law, you are not allowed to have multiple
pricing schemes other than for volume. So we are wrestling with
this one as we speak. We have a lot of loyal resellers. The guys at
the major shops are quite willing, if they have a product like an
operating system&mdash;this used to happen with the Macintosh OS at
places like MacWarehouse&mdash;to sell it at a loss because they know
customers will also buy more memory and a hard drive and maybe even
another computer. They are quite happy to sell that operating
system at a loss in order to get all the additional hardware
benefits from it. Also, the guys at Best Buy and Comp USA are
competing with each other for retail customers. As far as I can
tell, they are not making any money selling Red Hat, but they
perceive it is in their best interest to market their products that
way.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Are you saying that
Best Buy is paying $69 for it like Frank Kasper and Linux Mall,
then selling it at $65 as a loss leader?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: I am the wrong guy to
ask, to be perfectly honest. I don't even know what our pricing is!
I'd have to send you over to someone on our marketing side to give
you precise answers. But yes, that is a problem because they move
huge volumes, and as such, they get big discounts and smaller
resellers don't get quite the same discounts. All I can say on that
point is that we are actively working on it. We have clearly heard
the message from the channel and we are going to fix that issue as
well as we can.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Caldera started out
as the expensive distribution and has dropped their price, while
Red Hat has gone up to $80.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: No, you see, there is
complete fallacy in there&mdash;we give away our software for free, and
we continue to give our software away for free. So our price has
gone from zero dollars to zero dollars, and we are hard pressed to
see how there is a pricing increase in there. What our price
increase relates to is we do have a series of products based around
the software you can get for free.</p><p>We understand our competition isn't with Caldera or SuSE&mdash;our
competition is with Microsoft. If we are going to build world-class
support organizations and deliver world-class documentation so that
customers, who are used to buying products of the caliber Microsoft
produces, are going to choose to work with Linux and Red Hat
instead, we can't underprice that service. If we do, we won't
generate enough money to be able to deliver that quality of service
and support to our customers. So our flagship official Red Hat
Linux box set is now an $80 product because that's the minimum
price we think we can charge to provide world-class support and
documentation in that product. That product price may in fact go up
in the future if we conclude our customers are actually asking us
for it.</p><p>Meanwhile, we do have an upgrade version available for $40 on
our FTP site called the Core Product which is the full version, and
of course even here at the show, you've got Linux Central selling
$3.00 Red Hat 6.0 CD-ROMs. I'm not sure we can be accused of being
the high-point guys; I think we are the low-cost vendors, but then
so is Slackware and so is Debian. As far as we are concerned, we
think the guys at Slackware and Debian have much bigger market
shares. If we were trying to compete in the Linux space, we would
be focused on Slackware and Debian. But we are not trying to
compete in the Linux space, we are trying to compete with the very
big proprietary OS vendors who have hundreds of millions of
customers.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What can we expect
to see from Red Hat in the future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: Well, hopefully more
and more of the same. We think there are huge opportunities to do
very big projects in an open-source model. We really like what the
guys at AbiSource are doing with their products. We think the guys
at Cygnus are going to be doing very clever projects in the
open-source space. Of course, we are going to be doing even more
projects along these lines.</p><p>The enthusiasm you see here at the show has little to do with
any product, and everything to do with, for the first time, the
user getting real control over the technology they are using.
That's the one unique benefit we all deliver to the marketplace. We
intend to do more of that and do it better as we generate the
resources that enable us to do it. If the customers like it, we'll
generate the resources&mdash;we're a very customer-focused company. Go
talk to some attendees and find out what they want us to do, and
that's probably what we are going to do!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: There is a lot of
speculation that Red Hat is going to go public. Is that going to
happen?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bob</b></span>: No comment.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: No comment? Not
going to give me a scoop, eh? Well, that was the answer I expected,
but I had to ask. [On June 4, Bob announced that Red Hat was going
public
