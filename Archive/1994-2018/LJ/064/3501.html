    A brief look at several popular toolkits available for
    Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a094a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is now a reality&mdash;it is no longer
just a hacker tool or a toy for students. As such, it needs the
power of console programs ported to the graphical world. People
want easy-to-use desktops with good-looking programs. This is why
many programmers now turn to graphical toolkits.
</p><p>While many toolkits are available, they all share some basic
features. Since programming languages do not include built-in
functions to make graphical widgets, you must use add-ons.
Graphical toolkits are actually libraries which add functions to a
programming language, allowing you to integrate a graphical
interface to your program.</p><p>The main differences found between various toolkits are ease
of use, graphical appeal, cross-platform portability and language.
If, for example, you are experienced in the Tcl scripting language,
you will probably want to use the Tk graphical toolkit. If you like
Perl, you may pick Perl/GTK.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a09660"></a>GTK, the Gimp Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>The GTK toolkit seems to be one of the most popular. It is
modern and easy to use. That library was made in C as the base for
the GIMP, an image manipulation program. Now it is used by
programmers around the world for all kinds of applications,
including the GNOME desktop environment. The graphical interface
looks clean and much like interfaces on other operating
systems.</p><p>GTK is a good toolkit for writing applications in C, since it
is a C library. The GTK toolkit is built on top of the GDK library,
which is on top of GLIB. All three provide unique functions to
programmers. Available functions include memory handling, graphical
components and widgets. GNOME also has its own extensions. GTK and
GNOME are freely available software products.</p><p>The GTK library is available at
<a href="http://www.gtk.org" target="_self">http://www.gtk.org/</a>. A
tutorial on GTK is available at
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial1.2" target="_self">http://www.gtk.org/tutorial1.2/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a098c8"></a>QT from Troll Tech</h2></div></div><p>The QT toolkit was created by Troll Tech, a software company
in Norway, and is used in the KDE desktop environment. It is
written in C++ and used by programmers worldwide. The QT library
began as a commercial product, but now Troll Tech has released a
free version under an open license. Similar to GTK, it has the same
kind of widgets, including labels, entry boxes and text fields. QT
would be a good choice if you write applications in C++. The QT
library is cross-platform, and the graphical interface of programs
using it will compile without changes in both UNIX and Microsoft
Windows.</p><p>The QT widgets look very much like GTK's widgets, as well as
those of other operating systems.</p><p>The QT library is available from
<a href="http://www.troll.no" target="_self">http://www.troll.no/</a>. A
tutorial on QT is available from
<a href="http://www.troll.no/qt/tutorial.html" target="_self">www.troll.no/qt/tutorial.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a09b30"></a>wxWindows</h2></div></div><p>wxWindows (w for Windows, x for X Window System) was created
at the University of Edinburgh as a cross-platform toolkit.
wxWindows is a C++ framework that allows you to write graphical
applications. You can write your code once, then compile it under
one of the many ports of the library. It currently runs under
Microsoft Windows, Macintosh OS, Motif under UNIX and GTK. There is
one library per platform, all providing a common API.</p><p>wxWindows is a free product, under a license similar to the
L-GPL. Using it, you can write both commercial and free
products.</p><p>wxWindows is available from
<a href="http://www.wxwindows.org" target="_self">http://www.wxwindows.org/</a>.
A tutorial is available from
<a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/hello.htm" target="_self">web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/hello.htm</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a09d98"></a>GraphApp, Platform-Independent GUI Programming
in C</h2></div></div><p>This toolkit is a favorite of mine. GraphApp is a C library
that allows you to write simple graphical applications in C. It is
a cross-platform toolkit, and will work on the Macintosh OS,
Microsoft Windows, Motif under UNIX and Athena. GraphApp supports a
more limited number of widgets, but is truly easy to learn. You can
learn how to make graphical applications in less than an
hour.</p><p>A nice thing about GraphApp is that it compiles as a small
static library. This means you can compile your programs with the
library linked in them without increasing the size of the binary
much, and the user will be able to run it without installing the
toolkit.</p><p>The GraphApp toolkit is available at
<a href="http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~loki/graphapp" target="_self">http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~loki/graphapp/</a>.
A tutorial for GraphApp is available at
<a href="http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~loki/graphapp/tutorial" target="_self">http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~loki/graphapp/tutorial/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a0a000"></a>Motif, the Standard</h2></div></div><p>Motif has been the standard graphical toolkit for years on
UNIX and other platforms. It is a commercial standard and has its
own look. Motif is the base for the popular CDE desktop
environment, also a standard on many commercial UNIX
systems.</p><p>On Linux and other open systems, developers have made a free
Motif clone called LessTif. LessTif is source compatible with Motif
and available under the L-GPL. Motif and LessTif offer
cross-platform compatibility among UNIX systems. While Motif code
will not work on most non-UNIX systems, many commercial UNIX
systems come with Motif libraries. Also, Motif has the advantage of
having passed the test of time.</p><p>LessTif is available from
<a href="http://www.lesstif.org" target="_self">http://www.lesstif.org/</a>.
LessTif documentation is available from
<a href="http://www.lesstif.org/Lessdox/lesstif.html" target="_self">www.lesstif.org/Lessdox/lesstif.html</a>.</p><p>While I have not covered all existing toolkits, I have
briefly covered the most popular ones. Most programmers are
concerned about two things: graphical look and portability. GTK and
QT are probably used the most in the Linux world, mainly because of
the GNOME and KDE desktop environments. Users want a desktop that
will provide all utilities using the same graphical look. I use
both GTK and GraphApp, but this is a personal choice which every
programmer must make for himself.</p><p>The GNOME web page is at
<a href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_self">http://www.gnome.org/</a>.
