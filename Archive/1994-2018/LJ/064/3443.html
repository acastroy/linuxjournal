Edition</em></span> attempts to cover the whole of the Linux
knowledge base, and in that respect, it makes a fair showing. You
may, however, want to wait for a future edition, the reasons for
which I'll explain later.
</p><p>The book is fairly well-organized, granting a wide variety of
topics a decent amount of coverage. Even with the seemingly large
number of one thousand pages, however, there's a limit to how deep
a reader can delve; a few subjects seem spread a bit too thinly
(which is understandable, of course). The book is divided into
seven parts: Introduction to Linux, Linux Operations, Networking,
Shells, Editors and Utilities, Administration and Appendices. The
one noticeably absent area is multimedia&mdash;the only mention of
anything having to do with video, sound, graphics or gaming is a
two-page procedure on installing a sound card. Perhaps multimedia
will be dealt with in a future edition. Other than ignoring
multimedia, however, the areas chosen seem to cover the geography
of Linux fairly well.</p><p>Part I begins with an introduction to Linux, describing the
history of UNIX and Linux, then gives an overview of the whole
system (the shell, the file system structure, utilities, etc.). The
next chapter leads the reader through the installation process.
This chapter is heavily Caldera-oriented (the book comes with a
Caldera OpenLinux Lite v1.2 CD), and you probably won't have much
luck trying to install another distribution with these
instructions. Chapter three runs through basic Linux tasks such as
getting into your system through LILO, logging in and out, starting
X Windows, the manual pages, etc. Chapter four tells you about
window managers and desktops (such as the Caldera Desktop, with no
mention of KDE or GNOME). Later versions of OpenLinux include the
KDE desktop, so hopefully this will be updated soon.</p><p>Chapter five opens Part II with a guide to shell operations
(redirections, pipes, scripts, etc.). Chapter six describes the
Linux file structure, and the next chapter goes over file
management operations such as permissions and mounting file
systems.</p><p>In chapter eight, which begins Part III (Networking), one
learns how to run the basic e-mail utilities such as Mail, Elm and
Pine. Chapter nine goes over Usenet and newsreaders. Chapter ten
introduces several Internet tools (TELNET, FTP, archie, gopher,
etc.), and the Web is covered in the next chapter. In chapter
twelve, the process for creating many different types of Internet
servers (web servers, FTP servers, gopher servers, etc.) is
described in detail. Chapter thirteen goes over remote access
(UUCP, rsh, etc.).</p><p>Part IV, Shells, delves into the filters and regular
expressions, the Bourne Again Shell (BASH) and the TCSH shell. Here
you learn how to write your own shell scripts, as well as the
arcane technicalities of each of the two major shells.</p><p>Part V covers vi and Emacs in adequate detail. Though the
title of the section includes the word &ldquo;utilities&rdquo;, only those
two editors are covered.</p><p>Part VI, Administration, goes into systems configuration
(chapter nineteen is mistakenly labeled &ldquo;Device Configuration&rdquo; in
the header of each page), network administration (the basics of
TCP/IP, PPP and SLIP), X Window System configuration, typesetting
(TeX, LaTeX, Ghostscript), the standard Linux C compilers and
libraries (gcc, g++ and gdb), Perl, Tcl/Tk, Expect and gawk.</p><p>The last and seventh part is just a compilation of
appendices. The first lists hardware parameters that may be
necessary to pass to the kernel at boot time, such as those for
CD-ROM IRQs and other sometimes-annoying settings that don't
properly autodetect. The second lists all the software packages
that come with the OpenLinux CD, and the third lists the video
cards supported by the X Window System.</p><p>Apparently, the book was published before it was thoroughly
proofread&mdash;it is littered with glaring typographical and
grammatical errors, misspellings and repetitions (for example, some
text is repeated later on in the same chapter, almost word for
word). Linus Torvalds' name is repeatedly spelled without the final
&ldquo;s&rdquo;, and <b  >'/dev/cua1'</b> is used as a plural.
Given extensive proofreading by an editor with a sharp eye, and
adding a section on multimedia, the book could become a shining
jewel, but in its current state it isn't worth the price of $50
US.</p></div></div>
