    Mr. Thompson presents a bold and innovative business model for
    paying developers to produce free software.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26bc3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In &ldquo;Making Money in the Bazaar&rdquo; (June
1999), we raced across the landscape of current efforts to drive
innovation and make a living in the Open Source market. We now
introduce a system for consumer-driven Open Source funding. If
successful, it could accelerate the pace of innovation even further
and create a small industry around developing free software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26bc500"></a>The Need</h2></div></div><p>Is there some graphics hardware you wish Linux supported
better? A game you wish was ported from Windows? Or possibly a GUI
application to ease some parts of system setup?</p><p>If so, what do you do about it? If you are a developer, you
can just write it. The Linux model has been &ldquo;scratch your own
itch&rdquo; and contribute back to the community.</p><p>If you aren't a developer, don't have the time or the
necessary skill&mdash;you're out of luck. You have to wait and hope that
some other sufficiently motivated developer with the same need will
take on the project.</p><p>This can be quite frustrating&mdash;you need that graphics driver
<span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>. You could speed things up by hiring
someone to develop the software just for you. But paying a fortune
to have a custom driver developed for a $50 graphics board just
isn't feasible.</p><p>A larger group is needed to share the burden of developing a
standard driver. Several thousand people in the world probably use
that same graphics card and run Linux. Why don't some of them get
together and share the cost of having the work done?</p><p>The same concepts apply to scripts, help files,
applications&mdash;anywhere there is a demand for software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26bc818"></a>A Buyer's Co-op for Open Source</h2></div></div><p>The Internet is an amazing tool for bringing specialized
communities together. A group of people needing the same software
is just such a community.</p><p>The trick is to attract all of the interested parties to the
same web site, where they can pool their resources with others
wanting the same thing. This site must coordinate the process of
gathering support, selecting a developer, evaluating the resulting
software and collecting the funds to pay the developer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26bc978"></a>The Free Software Bazaar</h2></div></div><p><a href="3389s1.html" target="_self">Interview with Axel
Boldt</a></p><p>Axel Boldt's Free Software Bazaar was the first realization
of these ideas. It opened in the fall of 1998; within six months,
it collected over $25,000 US in offers and over $1200 in payments
towards Open Source projects. The site works by letting users
browse a list of existing offers. If a user is interested in
sponsoring an existing project or creating a new one, they send
e-mail to Axel. He then adds their offer to the listing
page.</p><p>These offers can be claimed by the first developer to
successfully complete the work. Axel then notifies the sponsors,
asking them to send payment directly to the developer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26bcb88"></a>CoSource.com</h2></div></div><p>The Free Software Bazaar is a great service to the Open
Source community. However, a huge ongoing effort is required to
maintain momentum and grow the movement into something
powerful.</p><p>For cooperative funding to become a significant force in the
Open Source market, the achievements of the Free Software Bazaar
must be multiplied many times. Managing the demands of so many
parties is a difficult problem. A cooperative funding service needs
to be innovative in solving the confidence and communication
problems between sponsors and developers. It should be convenient
and simple. It must be professional and build a strong record of
trust. In the end, it is essential to attract and maintain a
critical mass of sponsors and developers.</p><p>CoSource.com is an attempt to create a service that meets
these demands. It is a commercial enterprise created to provide the
range of services required to make cooperative funding a success
for buyers, developers and the Open Source community in
general.</p><p>It intends to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Publicize to better achieve a critical mass of
sponsors and developers for each project.</p></li><li><p>Have staff work with corporations directly to
encourage sponsorship and development of open source.</p></li><li><p>Provide VISA/MC/AMEX credit card processing to make
payment convenient (especially for non-US sponsors).</p></li><li><p>Automate as much as possible with HTML forms and a
database back-end.</p></li><li><p>Provide a stable web address and organization for
long-running projects.</p></li><li><p>Foster trust between buyers and developers through
simple, standard and legally binding on-line agreements.</p></li><li><p>Provide cash advances to developers with a proven
track record when they begin work.</p></li><li><p>Provide web space to trumpet the financial
contributions of corporations and individuals towards particular
projects.</p></li><li><p>Prevent duplication of effort by having sponsors
collectively hire a single developer to work on a project.</p></li><li><p>Allow sponsors to back out any time until a
developer is finally selected.</p></li><li><p>Allow full control for sponsors to select the
developer, development schedule, source code license, etc. that
suits them.</p></li></ul></div><p>If all these goals can be achieved, cooperative funding will
provide effective answers to the questions, &ldquo;How does one make a
living on free software?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Who is motivated to innovate?&rdquo;
</p><p>The answers are that innovation is funded directly by users
who pay for new features, which in turn supports a small army of
independent software developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26bd630"></a>How Does It Work for Sponsors and
Developers?</h2></div></div><p>It starts with an unfulfilled need. Maybe it's a driver for a
USB scanner, a plug-in to convert Excel spreadsheets or a port of
some game to Linux. The user goes to http://www.cosource.com/ and
finds the project to develop this feature. If it is not there, they
can add it with a form.</p><p>What is it worth to them for someone to develop this
software? Whether it is $10 or $1000, the customer sponsors the
project for that amount. This is not something done lightly. A
buyer is making a firm commitment to pay up if the software is
developed.</p><p>Other motivated sponsors come along and do the same. CoSource
goes out to corporations and seeks to supplement individual
sponsorships with a few large ones. Let's say the project is an HP
scanner driver. While HP isn't yet ready to pay the full cost of
developing a Linux driver, they may be willing to pay for 50% or
25% of the effort.</p><p>Developers, meanwhile, browse these same lists to identify
projects in their area of expertise. Suppose a developer has done a
converter for the Excel file format before. That developer fills in
a form to bid on the project, answering the following
questions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>How much would I have to be paid to do this
work?</p></li><li><p>What is my most conservative estimate for time to
completion? What license would it be released under (e.g., GPL,
BSD, etc.)?</p></li><li><p>Who will judge the final product for completeness
and quality (e.g., a known and trusted third-party
authority)?</p></li><li><p>What will be the URL of the project's web
page?</p></li></ul></div><p>CoSource then prices the bid for display on the system,
marking up the bid for transaction costs, historical sponsor fraud,
advance payments, project risk, etc.
</p><p>As bids are entered, sponsors are notified to evaluate them.
They submit a simple yes/no form in response. Voting yes to one or
more bids is a final commitment involving a legal agreement to
follow through if this developer succeeds. The first bid that gains
sufficient sponsorship wins. From that time forward, sponsors are
not permitted to back out and shortchange the developer.</p><p>The winning developer then begins work on the project,
providing updates on their project web page.</p><p>At some point, the developer believes he is complete. A
release is done and judged to determine if it matches the
requirements stated in the original project description. If the
release fails, the developer may try again many times until their
committed schedule runs out. If that unfortunate event happens, the
project goes back to the sponsor/bid phase.</p><p>If the release passes, the project is complete! Sponsors are
notified to fulfill their commitments. They can easily pay by
credit card. Finally, payments are consolidated and a single check
is mailed to the developer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26b45a0"></a>What Are the Goals?</h2></div></div><p>Obviously, this process is more complicated than a typical
software-buying experience. In return, the consumer gains much more
control over the quality and time frame of work. If you needed one
of the new features Windows 2000 provides, you would have to wait
two to three years after the initial promised ship date to get
them. How can a corporation plan ahead for software rollouts with
such uncertainty?</p><p>Cosourcing puts more control over features, schedule and
quality in the hands of the consumers.</p><p>Obviously, this system is not intended for charity or
non-profit activity. Rather, it is intended to be the most
effective way to outsource development of software and share that
cost with other motivated buyers. It is intended to be a way for
non-developers to &ldquo;scratch their own itch&rdquo;. It is intended to be
a fertile breeding ground for hundreds of individual and corporate
developers. It is intended to make the funding of Open Source a
collaborative effort in the same spirit the development process is
in today.</p><p>In general, it is intended to empower end users to spend
their hard-earned money making free software do what they
need.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c4580.0x26b47b0"></a>Making a New Market</h2></div></div><p>On one end of the software market spectrum is &ldquo;closed&rdquo;
software, where intellectual property is licensed on a per-copy
basis. On the other end is free software, where intellectual
property is created without payment and voluntarily given to the
community at large.</p><p>Both of these will continue to grow and thrive. On one hand,
closed software will continue to be a billion-dollar market. On the
other hand, innovative free software will continue to be developed
by students, hobbyists and professionals for various reasons. Both
systems make sense and they will continue to compete with each
other. But there is a possibility for a vibrant third market. One
which blends and bridges the differences between the other two. One
that brings the free market to free software.</p><p>This market will sell software as a service rather than a
product, so it will be compatible with Richard Stallman's original
and ongoing vision for public license code. This market will serve
the needs of end users by driving innovation in the areas that
matter most to them. This market will bring financial vitality to
free software, so thousands of individuals and small companies can
make their living developing it.</p><p><a href="3389s3.html" target="_self">Software in 2010&mdash;A Look Into the
Future</a></p><p>This vision may turn out to be a pipe dream. Consumer
psychology has rarely dealt with a case in which a group of
consumers pay for the development of a product, then allow that
product to be given away freely from that time forward.
Psychologically, this is a strange mix of self-interest and
altruism.</p><p>CoSource.com and others are going to put it to the test. If
you've ever complained about some missing piece of free software,
now you can put your money where your mouth is. Will you?</p><p><a href="3389s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
