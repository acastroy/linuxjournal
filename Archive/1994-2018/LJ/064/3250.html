    Writing a Sybase web application.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d853a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome Back! In the first two parts of
this series, we installed the Sybase database and configured the
Perl language to work with the database. In part three, we will
create a web application using our newly installed database server.
Before you can manage an application using the Sybase server, some
background information is in order. I will assume you have read the
two previous articles in the series.
</p><p>The example program is a bookstore on the Web. We will
discuss all aspects of creating and maintaining a client-server
application using the Sybase SQL server. You won't be an expert
after reading the article, but you'll have a good idea of what
needs to be done for client-server applications. The example
application will not be able to compete with Amazon.com, but it
will give you an idea of how to design a client-server application.
We'll first take a look at some Sybase SQL server basics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d85500"></a>Transactions</h2></div></div><p>The Sybase SQL Server is a transactional database server. A
transaction is a single piece of work. For example, placing an
order would be considered one transaction. Moving money from one
account to another is one transaction. Even if a transaction
affects two tables in our database, the entire transaction should
be completed or should not happen at all&mdash;it should never be
half-completed. For example, if you want to transfer $100 from your
savings account to your checking account, you either want the
transfer to happen or not happen. You don't want the $100 to be
removed from your savings account but not placed in your checking
account. The SQL to accomplish this transfer would look something
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
update accounts_t set balance = balance - 100
       where account_nbr = 'mysaving'
update accounts_t set balance = balance + 100
       where account_nbr = 'mychecking'
</pre><p>The bank wouldn't want the first update to execute without
the second one. If it were my account, I know I wouldn't. The
Sybase SQL Server allows the developer to denote where a
transaction begins and where it ends.
<pre     class="programlisting">
begin transaction
   update accounts_t set balance = balance - 100
      where account_nbr = 'mysaving'
   if @@error != 0
   begin
     rollback transaction
     return
   end
   update accounts_t set balance = balance + 100
      where account_nbr = 'mychecking'
   if @@error != 0
   begin
     rollback transaction
     return
   end
   commit transaction
   if @@error != 0
   begin
     rollback transaction
   end
</pre>


If you do not use the begin transaction and commit transaction
commands, the database server will assume each SQL command is a
single transaction. Make sure you use transaction control in your
application where it is needed. For more information on
transactions, see Chapter 17 in the Transact-SQL User's Guide.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d85710"></a>Logs</h2></div></div><p>The SQL Server uses a log to keep track of all transactions.
Each database has its own log. The log is part of the database and
is not human readable. Each change made to a database is saved in
the database's transaction log. Some databases save their data and
log information in the same area. Most databases have separate
areas for the data and their log. Each area of a database is called
a segment. By default, a database has three segments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>System: stores the database's system tables.</p></li><li><p>Log: stores the database's transaction log.</p></li><li><p>Default: stores all other database objects.</p></li></ul></div><p>You can create a database where all three segments are on the
same device. If you do this, you won't have as much control over
the database as you'd like. The best way to create a database is to
separate the log segment from the system and default segments. When
you create the database, you specify which devices to put the
database on. For more information on these segments and on creating
your own custom segments, look in chapter 16 of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>System Administration Guide</em></span> (see Resources).
For more information on creating databases, look in chapter 14. In
our example program, a database called book_d is created with 20MB
allocated for data and 10MB for log.
</p><p>All transactions that modify a database are saved in the
database's transaction log. The data in this log will keep
increasing until you back up the log to tape or disk. The data in
the log will remain even after all transactions are committed. It
stays until the log segment is backed up. This means you need to
back up your database often, or this log segment will fill up. When
the log segment fills up, you cannot make changes to data in this
database until you back up the log segment.</p><p>A function is available that will allow the database server
to automatically call a stored procedure when a segment is filling
up. So, you can write a stored procedure to automatically back up
the log when the segment is close to full. A stored procedure is an
object in the database containing SQL code. An example stored
procedure called
<span   class="bold"><b>sp_thresholdaction</b></span> that will back
up the log to disk is included in the application. For more
information about Threshold procedures, see chapter 21 of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>System Administration Guide</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d85c90"></a>Backups</h2></div></div><p>Just as any other part of a computer system, databases need
to be backed up. One approach would be to shut down the database
server, then back up the database device files. This could work,
but Sybase says a back up made this way is not guaranteed to
restore properly. Each database has to keep track of its logs and
the sequence of transactions. If any of these are out of sync with
the others, Sybase cannot use the database. Fortunately, Sybase has
created a backup server to help you back up your databases. It will
even let you run your backups while the database is still up. Your
bookstore can stay up 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p><p>You can back up your databases and logs to either disk or
tape using the Sybase backup server. To back up to tape, you'll
need to configure your tape device. Read Chapter 18 of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>System Administration Guide</em></span> to learn how to
configure your tape drive.</p><p>Depending on the size of your databases, I would recommend
backing up the logs at least once during the day and the databases
every night. If your databases are huge, you might not be able to
do this. Back up the logs as often as you can, but think of log
backups as changes made to the database. If the database gets
corrupted, you'll need to restore the database, then all the logs
you backed up since the database backup was made.</p><p>If you choose to save logs to a disk drive, I would highly
recommend they be saved on a separate disk from the one holding
your database. On one of our production database servers, we back
up the logs to disk at noon each day, then FTP them to another
system. This system has 20 1GB drives on it, so databases and logs
are located on different drives, and the log backups are on yet
another disk. For best performance, it would be best to keep
everything on separate small drives. The system can read and write
to multiple drives faster than to a large single drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d85ef8"></a>Database Consistency</h2></div></div><p>Each time you boot your Linux system, the
<span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> program is run against all
your file systems. The fsck program makes sure all the directories
and data are consistent. It is possible for a file system to become
out of sync, causing a loss of data.</p><p>The Sybase database server has a similar command. It is
called <span   class="bold"><b>dbcc</b></span> (database consistency
check). This command makes sure all data allocations are proper and
accounted for. These checks should be run regularly on your
databases. They can be scheduled just as you schedule your
backups.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d86108"></a>The Bookstore Application</h2></div></div><p>You can download the entire application from the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP server at
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue64/. To save space, the
entire application isn't presented here. There are two
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> files: 3250src.tgz and
3250cgi.tgz. The first one has the source code for all database
objects. Log in as the sybase user and unpack the tar files. Read
the README file before installing. You'll need to install the pubs2
example database shipped with the server. The second tar file has
all CGI scripts and other files needed for the application. These
files should be placed in the /cgi-bin directory of your web
server. Again, read the README file before installing. Sybase and
Sybperl must be installed to use this application. Information on
this installation is in the first two parts of this article.</p><p>This isn't an article about web development, so I won't go
into great detail about the web aspects of the application. It also
isn't a web application beauty contest. You will see I didn't spend
much time making it look nice. I'm sure you can find the time to
make the application look the way you like it.</p><p>If you installed the application in the default location, you
can start a web browser on your system and go to
<a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/store/store" target="_self">http://localhost/cgi-bin/store/store/</a>
to run the application. If you receive a &ldquo;File Not Found&rdquo; error
message, your CGI application cannot be found. On a default Red Hat
5.x system, the CGI perl script should be located at
/home/httpd/cgi-bin/store/store.</p><p>If you received an Internal Server Error message, your Perl
program probably isn't located at /usr/bin/perl. Edit the file
/home/httpd/cgi-bin/store/store/ and modify the path for Perl to
point to your Perl executable. One way to figure out the problem is
to run the Perl script at the command line. You should receive
HTML. If you receive an error message, you'll need to resolve this
problem.</p><p>If you receive the store menu, click on Search for Books. If
you receive an error message, your client cannot connect to the
database. Look at the file /home/httpd/cgi-bin/store/store.inc/.
You may need to change the name of the database server. Make sure
your database server is up and running. You should be able to
connect to it using the user name and password in the store.inc
file. Use the <span   class="bold"><b>isql</b></span> program at the
command line to test this.</p><p>Each screen of the application has a subroutine written in
Perl. The subroutine is named after the last part of the URL. To
search for books, the URL would be
<a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/store/store/search" target="_self">http://localhost/cgi-bin/store/store/search/</a>.
The subroutine responsible for this is called
<span   class="bold"><b>search</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d865d8"></a>The Application Database</h2></div></div><p>In our application, we use two databases. The first is the
pubs2 example database. We use the titles table as the list of
books. This table is read-only. We just view it; the application
does not make changes to it. The second database is called book_d
and it is created on two devices. The log segment is on device02
and has 10MB allocated to it. The data segment is on device01 and
has 20MB allocated to it. There are five tables in this
database.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>inventory_t: this table is a one-to-one
relationship to the titles table in the pubs2 database. There is
one row in this table for each row in the titles table. This table
contains the number of books in stock and the number on
order.</p></li><li><p>orders_t: this table is a list of customer
orders.</p></li><li><p>order_nbr_t: this table has one row in it. It is
used to guarantee that the order number is always unique.</p></li><li><p>types_t: this table is a list of the types of
books. It is used to populate the drop-down box on the search
screen.</p></li><li><p>user_t: this table is a list of customers.</p></li></ul></div><p>To provide access to the data, we use stored procedures in
all cases except one. Stored procedures are SQL code stored in the
database. This allows us to encapsulate procedures in the database
so it doesn't have to be replicated in all your applications. It
also provides a performance benefit. When the stored procedure is
loaded, the SQL is precompiled. When the application runs, the
server doesn't have to precompile the SQL, so the application
should run faster. We used SQL in the search1 procedure, because it
would change dramatically depending on the parameters given.
</p><p>In the scripts, we have also created a user to access the
database. Each time the CGI script runs, it logs in as this user.
The end users of your application do not need to know this, and in
fact, shouldn't know it. Even though this user has the minimum
rights necessary to run the application, you should protect this
user name and password.</p><p>This is a very small application. A few more things must be
done if you put this application into production.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make it look nicer. This application would have
looked fine in the early 90's, but in today's world, it would need
to look much better before people would use it.</p></li><li><p>Prepare and schedule automatic backups. Use
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> to back up your data at
regular intervals.</p></li><li><p>Prepare and schedule database consistency checks.
These should be run regularly, again using cron to schedule these
checks.</p></li><li><p>Create and tune table indexes. These tables have no
defined indexes. An index is extra data about the table that will
allow the database server to access the data faster.</p></li></ul></div><p>Explaining how the database server uses indexes is beyond the
scope of this article&mdash;I have a complete book on the subject.
Before you put an application into production, you should load
example data in all the tables and test queries to be run in your
application. Based on the queries, you can make good guesses as to
which indexes will be needed. There is a command in SQL that can
help tune indexes. It is <b  >set  showplan
on</b>. Entire book chapters are devoted to explaining this
command and its output.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x217f220"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, using a Sybase database as the basis for your
client-server applications is not a trivial task. The Sybase
database server is an industrial-strength database, capable of
handling hundreds of users and many gigabytes of data. Many
databases are available for Linux. Of the free ones, I believe the
Sybase database server is the most powerful. If you don't need a
powerful database, there may be better choices. If, however, you
need a high-power database to manage a large amount of data or many
users, a Sybase database server would be a solid foundation.</p><p><a href="3250s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
