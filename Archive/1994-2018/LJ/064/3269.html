    How to make those pesky new PnP sound cards work and play well
    on
    your Linux box.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b05450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Chances are, you or someone you know has
had to deal with plug-and-play (PnP) hardware. These devices are
just like &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; devices, except they have no jumpers to
configure the resources (i.e., IRQs, DMAs and I/O addresses). PnP
cards expect the computer, either the BIOS or the operating system,
to find and configure the card. It's an excellent idea, but why?
</p><p>Most Linux users enjoy configuring their computers&mdash;getting
their hands dirty working with the hardware. On the other side of
the coin is the user who expects his computer to turn on in the
morning and be ready for him to complete his work without
intervention by him. This type of user will also add hardware to
his computer, but does not want to spend time finding free
resources and setting them. PnP hardware is ideal for him.</p><p>This user can purchase a plug-and-play device, put it in his
computer, and the configuration is done automatically. This idea of
automatic configuration was designed into the PCI bus, the newer of
the common busses. Unfortunately, most users still rely on the
standard architecture defined by the industry; that is, the ISA
bus. It works well, but still has its limitations. Most notably,
plug-and-play was not considered when ISA was designed.</p><p>The designers of the plug-and-play standard decided to extend
plug-and-play to ISA devices. Wouldn't it be nice to have some sort
of detection and configuration scheme to find these devices and set
them up for the user? Think how easy computers would be! So, the
designers set up a scheme to find ISA cards and configure them to
the jumpered resources on the card. Hardware vendors loved the idea
and decided to cooperate by suggesting the removal of all the
jumpers.</p><p>Now we have a fully functional plug-and-play system for the
ISA bus, right? Well, not exactly. It still has a way to go before
it is all the way out the door. PCI architecture will take over in
the next few years before plug-and-play ISA works without any
problems. For now, we have to work with these plug-and-play ISA
devices while mourning the loss of our beloved jumpers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b056b8"></a>Using Plug-and-Play Devices</h2></div></div><p>PnP ISA devices can be used in several ways under Linux. The
kernel can find and configure them before loading any other
drivers. This method sometimes fails to find all devices and to
initialize the devices. It also requires patching the kernel with
one of the PnP add-ons.</p><p>Another way, which I recommend, is to use an initialization
program at the user level. You create a configuration file with
your devices and specify the resources each device is to use. Then,
this file is read by an initialization utility that configures the
devices. However, this method does require the drivers for these
devices to be compiled as kernel modules.</p><p>I have tried a couple of these user-level configuration
programs, and the one I have found to be the easiest and most
reliable is the <span   class="bold"><b>isapnptools</b></span>
package. This program is designed to work on systems with or
without a PnP-compatible BIOS. It will not interfere with
&ldquo;legacy&rdquo; ISA devices either (devices with jumpers); at least, I
have not had that problem.</p><p>As an example, I will configure a PnP sound card and load the
driver for it. I will assume you can install the card and you have
a working knowledge of Linux. Here's a basic overview of the setup
process:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>getting the
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnptools</b></span> package</p></li><li><p>dumping all possible values</p></li><li><p>choosing your resources</p></li><li><p>testing the configuration</p></li><li><p>compiling the kernel driver</p></li><li><p>enabling the device at bootup</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b05df0"></a>Getting the isapnptools Package</h2></div></div><p>Most of the latest Linux distributions come with the
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnptools</b></span> package. However, you
may want to grab the latest version from the
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnptools</b></span> web page,
<a href="http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools" target="_self">http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/</a>.
At the time of this writing, the latest version is 1.17.</p><p>After downloading the file, extract the contents and compile
it. Some systems may require editing the Makefile. Check the
included INSTALL file for more information. As root, I used the
following commands to compile and install the package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf isapnptools-1.17.tar.gz
cd isapnptools-1.17
make
make install (as root)
</pre><p>The installation will create the
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnp</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pnpdump</b></span> programs along with their
accompanying man pages and sample configuration file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b061b8"></a>Dumping All Possible Values</h2></div></div><p>After you've compiled and installed
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnptools</b></span>, it is time to
configure your devices. This is done by creating a configuration
file explaining the device(s) and which resources it will use. The
great thing about <span   class="bold"><b>isapnptools</b></span> is
that it will build this file for you. Then you go in and play
&ldquo;multiple choice&rdquo; (as the author puts it).</p><p>To create the configuration file, run the
<span   class="bold"><b>pnpdump</b></span> program. It scans for all
ISA plug-and-play devices and all possible configurations. These
values are dumped to standard out (STDOUT) in the file format
needed. Here is the command I use to create the file as
root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/pnpdump &gt; /etc/isapnp.conf
</pre><p><a href="3269l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Confuguration File
Start</a>
</p><p>The program failed on me a few times, but that was mainly due
to other system errors. You should now have a configuration file in
/etc if you used my command. The beginning of the file should look
something like Listing 1. The rest of the configuration file will
contain sections for the different devices it found. Now you need
to choose which resources the device will use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b06580"></a>Choosing Your Resources</h2></div></div><p>The configuration file may seem a bit confusing at first, but
it needs only a little deciphering. The basic layout for a device
section is shown in Listing 2. By default, a listing of all
possible resources for that device will be within the device
section. Basically, just uncomment the lines for the resources the
device will use. The lines are commented with # marks.</p><p><a href="3269l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Device
Section</a></p><p>Editing this file requires knowing a bit about the device to
be configured. Typically, the user manual for the device will list
which resources are required to use the device. In my case, with
the Sound Blaster AWE32, I needed a Base I/O address, one IRQ, an
8-bit DMA channel, a 16-bit DMA channel and a MIDI synthesizer I/O
address. Other resources are on my card, but I am not using them in
this example.</p><p>The example device section in Listing 2 shows the resources I
chose for my card. I chose 0x0220 for the Base I/O address, 5 for
the IRQ channel, 1 for the 8-bit DMA channel, 5 for the 16-bit DMA
channel and 0x0330 for the MIDI I/O.</p><p>Note that the I/O addresses are called IO 0 and IO 1, and the
DMA channels are called DMA 0 and DMA 1. This may make it a little
difficult to map the right values to the 8-bit DMA and 16-bit DMA.
However, if you read your configuration file after running
<span   class="bold"><b>pnpdump</b></span> and look at the default
resource settings in the user manual for your device, you can
easily match things up.</p><p>In my case, I know DMA 0 corresponds to the 8-bit DMA because
only the 8-bit DMA can have a value of 1. So, the other setting
must be the 16-bit DMA channel. The same goes for the IO settings;
IO 0 must be the Base I/O address, because the MIDI I/O address can
never be 0x0220.</p><p>Once you have uncommented the lines you need, make sure the
(<b  >ACT Y</b>) line is uncommented; otherwise, your
device will not be configured.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b069a0"></a>Testing the Configuration</h2></div></div><p>You have now passed the hard part of PnP configuration under
Linux. It is a good idea to test your PnP configuration before
going any further. You want to make sure
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnp</b></span> can properly initialize the
card with the resources you have set. Assuming
<span   class="bold"><b>isapnp</b></span> is in /sbin, execute this
command to test your configuration:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
</pre><p>If there are no error messages, your configuration should
work fine. If you do get resource conflict errors, now would be a
good time to go back and edit that configuration file. It is better
to get it working now than have to fool with it later. Play around
with the resource settings until you find those that don't produce
errors when you test the configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1b06c08"></a>Compiling the Kernel Driver</h2></div></div><p>Now we are ready for the fun part. Most Linux distributions
will come with the various device drivers compiled as modules.
Refer to the kernel documentation for more information about
modules. Basically, a module is just a device driver that can be
added to an already-running kernel. This provides a lot of
flexibility for the user, and it is modules that allow us to use
PnP devices.</p><p>PnP devices must be initialized before the driver can be
loaded, so using modules is a necessity. They are the only part of
the kernel that can be loaded after the kernel boots.</p><p>Your distribution may already include a module for the device
you want to use. In the case of sound cards, you might be compiling
one from scratch. In my example, I use a Sound Blaster AWE32. The
device driver included with my distribution is
/lib/modules/2.0.35/misc/sound.o.</p><p>If you must recompile, be sure to set any resources for the
driver according to those set in the isapnp.conf file. You can
always pass the resource values when loading the module, but having
the default ones is always nice.</p><p>To load the driver for my PnP sound card, I did this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/isapnp /etc/isapnp.conf
/sbin/modprobe sound.o io=0x0220 irq=5 dma=1\
   dma1=5
</pre><p>If all goes well, you should have a driver loaded and working
with that device. Check to make sure the module is loaded by
typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/lsmod
</pre>


If this is a sound card, try playing sound files. For network
cards, try bringing up the device with
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span>. At this point the device
should be working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a0d580.0x1eff220"></a>Enabling the Device at Bootup</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have your PnP card working under Linux, wouldn't
it be great if those devices were set up automatically at boot
time? I added the above two lines to my /etc/rc.d/rc.local file, so
that my sound driver is loaded each time I boot the system.</p><p>This example used what I view as the most common
plug-and-play situation when using Linux&mdash;a sound card. Other PnP
devices exist, such as modems and network cards. The same technique
can be applied to those cards as well.</p><p><a href="3269s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
