Rectiphy's ActiveImage Protector Linux Edition</h2></div></div><p>
At Rectiphy, innovation goes beyond the spelling of the company name to
include its new technology&mdash;that is, the company's ActiveImage Protector
Linux Edition. The product is a disk-imaging backup technology for
Linux environments that incorporates Rectiphy's Smart Sector snapshot
technology, which the company says speeds up backups and reduces disk
storage space in Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 formats. Support for the Linux-native
snapshot driver enables users to create a full backup of the Linux
server HD or volume without shutting down the OS. Bare-metal recovery is
supported, as well as retrieval of individual files from the backup image.

Stefan Kottwitz's <span   class="emphasis"><em>LaTeX Beginner's Guide</em></span> (Packt Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
Few things will burnish your hard-core technorati credentials like learning
the classic document markup language LaTeX and its typesetting companion
program TeX. The tools are used for creating scientific and technical
documents. Get up to speed fast with Stefan Kottwitz's <span   class="emphasis"><em>LaTeX Beginner's
Guide</em></span>, a new book that helps new users overcome LaTeX's relatively
steep learning curve and leverage its powerful features. Readers learn
to typeset documents containing tables, figures, formulas and common
book elements like bibliographies, glossaries and indexes. Additional
topics include management of complex documents and the latest fonts and
PDF-related features. A great deal of the book is dedicated to one of
LaTeX's most powerful features: the designing of complex math formulas
and other expressions.

Cory Altheide and Harlan Carvey's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital Forensics with Open
Source Tools</em></span>
(Syngress)</h2></div></div><p>
Syngress describes Cory Altheide and Harlan Carvey's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital
Forensics with Open Source Tools</em></span> as &ldquo;digital forensics, MacGyver
style.&rdquo; Unfortunately for the 1980s TV hero MacGyver, his toolset
predated open source. But thanks to Altheide and Carvey, you have all
the open-source forensics tools at your disposal for investigating Linux,
Mac and Windows systems, complete with guidance. Topics include
the open-source examination platform, disk and filesystem analysis,
system-specific issues and artifacts, Internet-related artifacts, file
analysis, automating analysis and more. The appendix goes into detail
on particularly useful open-source tools.

Xelltec Integrated Security System</h2></div></div><p>
The team at Xelltec categorizes it new Xelltec Integrated Security
System (XISSYS) as &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; because it enables users
&ldquo;to
remotely track and protect their laptops and handheld devices&rdquo;. The
patent-pending XISSYS microchip is an embedded security solution designed
to allow users to disable or find a stolen laptop, smartphone,
or other mobile device easily. This prevents thieves from gaining access to
sensitive data. The microchip can wipe out data, or it can 
destroy the mobile device physically with a high-frequency voltage so that it is
completely inoperable. Furthermore, if the user needs the data that
is on the mobile device, it can be copied remotely from the device to a
server before the data is destroyed. The microchip also acts as a tracking
device, enabling the owner to find the physical location of the stolen
device. Xelltec is seeking strategic alliances with popular main board and
computer manufacturing companies worldwide.

Napatech Software Suite</h2></div></div><p>
If you deploy the new Napatech Software Suite for your network
appliance development, the company says you'll need to
develop its application software only once and then simply decide which
network adapter combination works best in the particular deployment.
Besides this flexibility, the suite offers critical functionality
that can accelerate performance of network appliances. Both a hardware
abstraction and streamlined API are provided, allowing network appliance
vendors to take advantage of Napatech's full range
of intelligent network adapters quickly and easily. Hardware abstraction allows multiple
intelligent network adapters of different types to be combined on a
plug-and-play basis in a standard server platform. The same feature set
can be offered independent of the port speed. A number of open-source
software applications, such as Suricata, Snort and Ostinato are supported.

CloudPassage's Halo SVM and Halo Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
CloudPassage recently launched out of &ldquo;stealth mode&rdquo;, releasing a
formidable one-two punch for securing elastic cloud environments in
the form of Halo SVM and Halo Firewall. Punch one, Halo SVM, addresses
the specific server vulnerability management needs in cloud server
environments, such as elasticity. Customers can maintain continuous
exposure and compliance intelligence, even in rapidly growing cloud
server farms. Other features include a light footprint and ability to
assess thousands of server configuration points in seconds. Punch two,
Halo Firewall, controls server attack surfaces by centralizing and
automating host-based firewall management, the preferred alternative
to traditional enterprise perimeter firewalls, says CloudPasage.

Open-Xchange Microsoft Outlook Connector</h2></div></div><p>
Applying the Linux community's classic flair for maximizing
interoperability, Open-Xchange introduced full MAPI support to its
completely redeveloped Microsoft Outlook Connector. The move enables users
of its open-source Open-Xchange e-mail and collaboration server to use
Microsoft Outlook as the client software. The Open-Xchange alternative to
the more expensive Microsoft Exchange server integrates e-mail, calendar,
contact and task management with advanced groupware features, such as
information management and document sharing, along with cutting-edge
social-network integration. While users utilize the familiar client, the
new software connector ensures seamless synchronization with Open-Xchange
server in the background. The software connector supports Microsoft
Outlook 2003 and 2007, as well as the 32-bit version of Outlook 2010.
