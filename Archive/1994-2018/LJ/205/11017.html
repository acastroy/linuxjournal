Brain Workshop
(<a href="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net" target="_self">brainworkshop.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're looking to improve your mental faculties, especially in the area
of memory, check out this project. According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Brain Workshop is a free open-source version of the dual n-back brain
training exercise.
</p><p>
...A recent study published in <span   class="emphasis"><em>PNAS</em></span>, an important scientific journal,
shows that a particular memory task called dual n-back may actually
improve working memory (short-term memory) and fluid intelligence.
</p><p>
...Brain Workshop implements this task. The dual n-back task involves
remembering a sequence of spoken letters and a sequence of positions
of a square at the same time, and identifying when a letter or position
matches the one that appeared in trials earlier.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11017f1.large.jpg"><img src="11017f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Anatomy students will be chuffed with this brain diagram

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11017f2.large.jpg"><img src="11017f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The main playing mode involves remembering letters and
positions, two turns back.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11017f3.large.jpg"><img src="11017f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Some of the advanced playing modes of Brain Workshop include multiple 
audio streams, images, arithmetic and more.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Although running Brain Workshop isn't particularly difficult,
installing another external program, AVBin 7, is recommended.
</p><p>
Head to the project Web site, click the Download link, and click the
link, &ldquo;Source Distribution for Linux&rdquo;. This page contains instructions
for both Mac OS X and Linux. Scroll down the page for the Linux
instructions. The only other real requirement mentioned here is Python
2.5, although most modern distros likely have this pre-installed.
</p><p>
As I mentioned above, the instructions say that you should install AVBin 7. Although this
is optional, it will give you musical cues that are rather satisfying,
so I recommend doing so. Luckily for me, the Webmaster has been
good enough to provide detailed instructions for AVBin's installation,
as well as links to both 32- and 64-bit versions.
</p><p>
Once the prerequisites are out of the way, grab the latest tarball and
extract it. From here, the Webmaster again has done the work,
so I'm quoting the next step verbatim:
&ldquo;Open a terminal, enter the brainworkshop directory and type <tt  >python
brainworkshop.pyw</tt> to launch Brain Workshop. You also may enable
execute permissions on brainworkshop.pyw, if you'd like to launch it,
by double-clicking.&rdquo;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Upon entering the program, you'll be greeted with a menu and a
fabulous background diagram of an anatomical brain. I could explore a number
of options at this point, but for now, let's jump
right into the game.
</p><p>
Press the spacebar, and the level that's about to start appears, most likely
called Dual 2-Back. Here you can alter the game mode if
you know what you're doing. Press the spacebar a second time, and the level 
actually starts.
</p><p>
Now strap yourself in, because this game is much more grueling than it
first appears. Assuming you have the game set to its defaults, two
stimuli will be coming at you: positions and audio. The former appears
in the guise of a blue square, appearing randomly in any of the nine
squares. The latter takes place as letters, spoken out loud by a female
voice that just happens to sound like the one used on almost all computer
systems in every futuristic sci-fi movie ever made.
</p><p>
As this is happening, you control the game with only two keys:
A and L. Let go of the mouse, and let your left hand rest on A and your
right hand on L. Now, I'll explain how the game actually works.
</p><p>
Each level has a series of three-second Trials. The first Trial
will have the square appear in one of the boxes in tandem with a spoken
letter. The second Trial will have the square in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> box with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> spoken letter. These first two Trials don't
require you to do
anything, but instead provide the information for the following Trials.
</p><p>
Given this default mode is &ldquo;2-Back&rdquo;, the information provided in the first
Trial is the basis for testing against in the third Trial. The information in
the second Trial is for testing against the fourth, and so on. Now, let's
examine the third Trial and onward, where the actual game begins.
</p><p>
Was the position of the blue block the same as the first Trial? If so,
press the A key. Was the letter the same? If so, press L. Each Trial
may have a combination of both position and letter, or just the one, or even no matches.
</p><p>
As you can see, this game mode is all about remembering what
happened two Trials ago. This sounds easy, but
each stimulus acts independently of the other, so most of the time,
the letter and position won't land in the same place. This means
your memory has to split in two different directions&mdash;multitasking
in memory.
Does that sound tricky? Believe me, it is. I'd even go so far as to
call it intense.
</p><p>
Chances are you'll get a bad score, but that's okay. The manual
recommends starting with a game of 1-Back, but I thought I'd start you
off with the harder mode because I'm mean like that! If you want to alter
the difficulty, prior to starting a level is a list of options at the
top left where you can increase/decrease the N-Back number (try 1 for
instance), the number of trials, change the speed and so on.
</p><p>
That's all I have space for here, but if you want more information, check out the
game's documentation available at the main menu. I recommend looking
into the game's more-advanced features, such as color and image testing,
arithmetic and more.
</p><p>
All in all, this is one of the most grueling brain exercises
I've come across, and anyone looking to improve specific areas of memory
definitely should try Brain Workshop.

SerbDict&mdash;Serbian-English Dictionary
(<a href="http://serbdict.sourceforge.net" target="_self">serbdict.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I've highlighted a few language programs in this column, but so
far they've been for Japanese, Chinese and German&mdash;all languages spoken
by large populations. So a dictionary program for a language like
Serbian jumped right out at me.
According to the SourceForge page:
&ldquo;Serbian Dictionary is a bidirectional Serbian-English dictionary. It
currently contains only a command-line interface. It supports only
*nix-based operating systems at this moment. Tested on Linux, *BSD and
Cygwin.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11017f4.large.jpg"><img src="11017f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
SerbDict lets you translate words from English to Serbian and vice versa.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11017f5.large.jpg"><img src="11017f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Here's a search involving Serbian to English and a search involving
both languages simultaneously.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
I found only a source tarball at the Web site at the time of this writing,
although the installation still is quite easy. Also, the home page is in
Serbian, and I had to use a translator (Chrome's translator handled this 
well). The download page at least is called &ldquo;Download&rdquo;,
so that was easy.
The download page takes you to a basic SourceForge file list, which should
be localized into your own language.
</p><p>
Grab the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new
folder. Compiling this program is easy, just enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
And, if your distro uses root, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Using SerbDict also is very easy (at least, once I'd translated the
documentation). If you want to translate something from English into
Serbian, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ serbdict -e word
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to translate a Serbian word into English, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ serbdict -s word
</pre>
</p><p>
SerbDict appears to query a database of words and terms, and it outputs
everything, including extensions of your queried word. For instance,
querying the word &ldquo;entire&rdquo; gave me not only translations for entire,
but also for entirely and entirety.
</p><p>
If you speak Serbian (and I don't), there's a man page with instructions
on how to extend the program, available with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ man serbdict
</pre>
</p><p>
One thing I managed to pick up from the man page is that if you skip the
-s and -e extensions, any query you make will output any matches in both
English and Serbian at the same time.
</p><p>
Below your outputted text will be a message saying, &ldquo;Ukupno:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
prevoda&rdquo;. After querying those words, it turns out Ukupno means
altogether. And although &ldquo;prevoda&rdquo; didn't return any matches, prevod means
rendering, translation or version, so I'm guessing prevoda would be
some kind of plural form of these words.
</p><p>
Well, that covers Serbian, but if anyone has written a program
for a really rare or dying language, send me an e-mail. I'd love to cover it.

ebook2cw&mdash;E-book to Morse Code Conversion
(<a href="http://fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html" target="_self">fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
You know I love niche projects, but this is the first project
I've come across that genuinely made me laugh out loud and exclaim,
&ldquo;I've got to cover that!&rdquo;
To quote the Web site:
&ldquo;
ebook2cw is a command-line program (optional GUI available) that
converts a plain text (ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8) e-book to Morse code MP3
or OGG audio files. It works on several platforms, including Windows
and Linux.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11017f6.large.jpg"><img src="11017f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Turn e-books into Morse code audio tracks&mdash;I'm guessing this is intended
for Morse code students.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Quoting the documentation:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
1) Binaries:
statically compiled binaries are available at the project Web site, for Linux
(i386) and Win32. Those should be suitable for most users.
</p><p>
2) Source:
a Makefile is included; it compiles both under Linux and Windows (with MinGW).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Library requirements are mostly minimal, but for the source, you will need
the development packages (-dev) installed for the lame and ogg libraries.
</p><p>
If you're running with the source, grab the latest tarball, extract it,
and open a terminal in the new folder. Compiling this program is also
easy. Again, just enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
ebook2cw is a command-line program and using it is fairly simple,
although you'll want to keep the man pages at the ready for using
something other than the default parameters. The basic syntax is as
follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ebook2cw textfile.txt -o outputfile
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, the textfile.txt obviously represents whichever text file you want
to convert to Morse code. The -o switch is for specifying the output
file, followed by the output file's name. Notice I haven't given
the output file an extension, such as mp3. ebook2cw does this for you
automatically, and I actually recommend against doing so, as the
resulting filename becomes rather messy.
</p><p>
I don't have the space to go into detail on ebook2cw's command-line
switches, but I can at least highlight a handful that will be the most
useful to the majority of users.
</p><p>
If you want to switch from MP3 output to Ogg, use the switch -O (note
the uppercase letter).
</p><p>
The sample rate is set by default to 11khz @ 16kbps&mdash;perfectly adequate
for a series of dots and dashes, but sometimes it's a bit clippy and horrid
to listen to. If you want to change the sample rate to 44khz, for instance,
use the switch: <tt  >-s 44100</tt>. To change the bitrate,
using this combination, set the bitrate at 64kbps: <tt  >-b 64</tt>.
</p><p>
You can work things out from here, but I hope you enjoy the
results. Maybe the works of Dickens are even better, slowly spelled out
one letter at time? Either way, this project has probably given me the
biggest grin since I started this column.
I'm sure it'll be very useful&mdash;to someone.
