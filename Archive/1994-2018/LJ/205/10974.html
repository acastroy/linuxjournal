Learn how to secure your virtual environment from every angle.

The barriers between physical and virtual are disappearing rapidly in the
data center. With virtualization's myriad benefits and the emergence
of cloud computing, many shops are virtualizing their server and desktop
systems at a breakneck pace. In this great migration to the virtual,
admins face new security challenges in the transition that require a much
broader knowledge of the enterprise. Couple these new challenges with the
ease of access users now have to build their own virtual resources, and
you quickly can find your environment in a state of &ldquo;virtual
sprawl&rdquo;. The
good news is that by following a few simple guidelines and utilizing a
defense-in-depth strategy, you can minimize your risk whether you're
deploying a new virtual infrastructure or just trying to manage sprawl.
</p><p>
In the course of this article, I discuss several high-level security
concerns when deploying a virtual environment. In each area of concern
covered, I offer basic guidance for dealing with the issues,
and when possible, I offer technical solutions to address the associated
risks. In keeping with a big-picture view, I don't provide detailed
instructions for the specific solutions presented. The vastness of
the product space and the limited format of this article also prevent
me from delving into every solution available. Although I attempt
to stay vendor-neutral, not every vendor offers a product or solution
to address each security concern presented here. In those instances,
I briefly look at those products/solutions that are available.
</p><p>
To keep this discussion focused, I won't delve into any esoteric
arguments about type 1 or type 2 hypervisors, nor do I discuss the
merits of para-virtualization versus hardware translation/emulation. I
also stick to products that use a Linux-based hypervisor (including
Linux KVM). The use of the term host in this article refers to the
underlying physical system with direct access to the hardware. The term
guests refers to those virtual machines (VMs) that run an instance
of an OS on top of the host virtualization software or hypervisor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf3580.0x1deb568"></a>
Physical Security</h2></div></div><p>
The first area to consider is physical security. Virtualization
is all about separating the hardware from the OS, but VMs still run
on a piece of iron. As such, you can use the same best practices for
hardening physical hardware to secure your virtual host. Use common-sense controls like placing locks on your racks and servers and securing
keyboard-video-mouse consoles. Be aware of operational factors,
such as power, cooling and cabling. As virtualization consolidates systems
to achieve higher hardware efficiency, your host servers become hotter
and draw more power as they are utilized more. Always make sure your
data center has adequate power and cooling to maintain your systems' basic operations.
</p><p>
If building your host servers from scratch, properly size your systems
before deploying them. Several vendors provide excellent sizing
guides to do just this (Figure 1). Although these baselines may not
be an exact representation of your final deployment, they are a good
way to approximate your hardware needs. When thinking about hardware,
keep performance and redundancy at the forefront. An overtaxed system
is easier to penetrate, manipulate and deny access to. As a general
guideline, install surplus storage and memory, because those are the typical
bottlenecks on hosts. Buy as many of the fastest high-capacity disks you
can afford. More disks usually mean more IOPS. You also should have an
enterprise-grade array controller running your drives. Consider using
a RAID level that has both a stripe and uses parity, such as RAID 10, 5
or 50. Memory should be fast and large in quantity. With excess storage
and memory, you create a cushion against undersizing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10974f1.large.jpg"><img src="10974f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. HP's ESX Sizing Tool
</p></div></div><p>
Consider using a separate physical network from your production network
for your hosts. This reduces chatter on your other segments and makes it
easier to secure the segment assigned to your hosts and their guests. When
using networked or shared storage to store your VM's data files and
virtual disks, use another dedicated segment to separate and streamline
storage-related traffic.
</p><p>
In terms of redundancy, try to follow the old adage of &ldquo;buy two of
everything&rdquo;. Look for cost-effective redundant options for your host
systems, such as redundant power supplies and multipathed or teamed
network ports. Storage also should be highly redundant. Consider the
number of disks needed for each type and how many disk failures can
be tolerated when selecting your RAID level. If using network storage,
look into redundant options for your NAS/SAN/shelf. This can give you
the ability to hot-failover VMs during system failure using tools like
VMware's vMotion and Storage vMotion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf3580.0x1deb9e0"></a>
Disaster Recovery</h2></div></div><p>
Always make sure you take regular backups of your host systems. Although
technology such as vMotion can make host backups seem trivial, backups
still are vital to your disaster recovery options. Backing up a host
typically entails running an operation from a command-line interface. In
VMware, this is done from the virtual Command-Line Interface (vCLI)
using the <tt  >vicfg-cfgbackup.pl</tt> command. In XenServer, the
command is <tt  >xe
host-backup</tt>. Because KVM runs on the Linux kernel, you simply can back up the
kernel using normal methods.
</p><p>
Several options are available for backing up guests. At the
data level, guests are made up of one or more files that contain a guest's
configuration and virtual disks, so it is quite viable simply to back up
those files on the host or wherever they might be stored. The downside to
backing up guests this way is that the guest has to be powered down. You
can avoid this problem with a variety of dedicated backup solutions
that use snapshot technology to back up running guests. There are
impressive offerings from Symantec (Backup Exec) and Veeam for VMware
deployments. For XenServer environments, there is Alike by Quorum Systems
(Figure 2). If you have a mixed environment with multiple hypervisor
types, consider Arkeia's Network Backup, which can back up all of the major
vendors' systems with the exception of Linux KVM. Linux KVM users have
limited options, but one popular technique for backing up running guests
involves taking a snapshot of a guest volume using LVM and then syncing
the resulting snapshot file to another disk on a remote server. If you are
unable to back up the guest's virtual data/disk files or take a snapshot,
you always can use traditional backup methods to back up the guest OS.

Hypervisor/Host Security</h2></div></div><p>
Next up is the hypervisor. The hypervisor is the virtualization
software (or layer) that controls communication between, and access to,
the hardware and the guests. It usually is composed of a streamlined
distribution of an operating system run from either internal or external
storage and typically is segmented into its own special partition. With
the exception of Microsoft's Hyper-V, hypervisors usually are a flavor
of Linux. In the case of Linux KVM, it is actually a Linux kernel module,
but I treat it as a hypervisor.
</p><p>
As much as the hypervisor is the heart of the virtualization, it also
is a big juicy target. This was a major concern with virtualization early on,
and it continues to be so. If you can exploit and control the hypervisor on
a host, you can control every guest it controls. The primary factors in
determining the hypervisor's security are its size and complexity.
Fortunately, the current trend sees vendors reducing their hypervisor's
footprint to an operationally minimal size, which reduces the threat
surface. Regardless of size, the hypervisor still is software, and
just like any critical piece of software, it is imperative that you 
patch it regularly.
</p><p>
In addition to patching, make sure to allocate your
hardware resources appropriately on the host. This means setting limits/ceilings on your
guest's hardware utilization. As a best practice, set limits on memory
and processor utilization, or if you want to go further, set limits on
network traffic. This ensures performance baselines are met across
your guests and reduces the threat of DOS attacks or unintended hardware
spikes bringing down the host or other guests. You can set these limits
through most of the available management GUIs (Figure 3), or in the case
of KVM, you can use cgroups.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10974f3.large.jpg"><img src="10974f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Limiting Utilization with Resource Allocation in VMware
</p></div></div><p>
When using any management GUIs that access your hosts, make sure to
evaluate and develop a policy regarding access to them before providing
access to users. Follow a least-privilege model for permissions, and when
possible, use an external authentication source. Also consider using
role-based access controls (RBACs) if they are available for your solution
(Figure 4). RBACs provide granular control over operation-specific
permissions, such as the ability to create new guests or move guests
between hosts.

Guest Security</h2></div></div><p>
Securing your guests may be the easiest part of the process. You can use
many of the same practices to secure your guests as you would a physical
box. These practices include regular patching, using an antivirus,
implementing host- (guest-) based firewalls and locking down unneeded
services. If deploying a large number of VMs at once, consider using
a common template to deploy your VMs. This standardizes your builds
and makes securing and managing them easier. If you are deploying
a specific application with its own set of security best practices
(for example, Apache or MySQL) to a guest, follow those as well. Next, determine the
criticalness and/or sensitivity of your guests, and, if necessary, place
them in different security domains. It is quite possible to mix guests
in different domains on a single host. It's also possible to segment
your guests onto different host-specific or physical networks (more on this
in the next section of this article).
</p><p>
In addition to any application controls, consider using some form of
mandatory access control at the guest level, such as sVirt for KVM. sVirt
uniquely labels guest processes running on the host to identify them to
the hypervisor. This provides a framework for admins to determine which
guests and/or processes are authorized to communicate with the hypervisor
(see the sVirt sidebar). If you plan to provide remote access to your guests' OS,
determine how your clients and/or admins will do so. Will they use SSH,
VNC or remote desktop? Once you have settled on a remote access method,
be sure to use a least-privilege model and follow any best practices for
locking down your specific solution, such as using nonstandard ports
and using certificates.

sVirt</b></p><p>
To verify that sVirt is in use, use <tt  >virsh list</tt> to see
the VMs
that are running. Then, dump the VM's XML file using <tt  >virsh
dumpxml</tt>, and look for <tt  >svirt</tt> in the label:


<pre     class="programlisting">

[root@systemname ~]# virsh list
 Id Name                 State
----------------------------------
  5 jbxp4                running

[root@systemname ~]# virsh dumpxml jbxp4 | grep label
 &lt;seclabel type='dynamic' model='selinux'&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;system_u:system_r:svirt_t:s0:c335,c384&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;imagelabel&gt;system_u:object_r:svirt_image_t:s0:c335,c384&lt;/imagelabel&gt;
 &lt;/seclabel&gt;

</pre>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf3580.0x1dec900"></a>
Monitoring and Alerts</h2></div></div><p>
Once your hosts and guests are in place, regularly monitor your virtual
environment. Doing so minimizes incidents of configuration errors or
host/guest failures, unauthorized creation of new guests. There are
many ways to monitor your virtual environment, but the best is
to combine the internal OS logging on your guests with tools provided
by your virtualization product (Figure 5). There is also a budding
market of third-party products, such as Reflex Systems vWatch, which has
extended monitoring capabilities, such as the ability to monitor for 
change controls and guest software/asset inventorying.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10974f5.large.jpg"><img src="10974f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Viewing Events in XenCenter
</p></div></div><p>
Also keep an eye on performance. Even with resource allocation in place,
hosts can spike due to overpopulation or hardware failures. Most
vendors' management GUIs have some form of performance
monitoring. Open-source users can use virt-manager for KVM or Convirt
to monitor performance on KVM and Xen systems (Figure 6). With reliable
knowledge of your host utilization, you can plan future hosts better
and improve your ability to consolidate, which in many cases, means
improving ROI.

</p></div></div><p>
It always is good practice to automate your systems to alert you to
failures or outages. This logic extends to virtual environments as
well. Redundancy is great, but if a failure is not acted on in a timely
fashion, it can cost you further time and money. Alerts also may help
you with any service level agreements (SLAs) and compliance issues
(such as PCI, Sarbanes-Oxley and so on). A number of management tools have
alerting built into them, but it also is easy to integrate SNMP and
other monitoring protocols with a solution like Zenoss to keep an eye
on your virtual environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf3580.0x21e50d0"></a>
Virtual Network</h2></div></div><p>
The last area to secure is networking. Securing your virtual networking
environment can be divided into two parts: securing management interfaces
and guest networking. In most scenarios, the host utilizes one network
interface card (NIC) as a management interface and shares the remaining
port(s) between the guests. Any management interfaces should be placed on
a separate physical network from any network your guests will use. If you
are using a proprietary management client, limit access to the client
install files and make sure you use some method of authentication or
role-based access control (both mentioned earlier). If you are managing a
Linux-KVM based system, follow the normal recommendations for securing SSH.
</p><p>
When it comes to networking guests, you have two basic options: bridging
with NAT or using a virtual switch. Bridging is simple and quick to set
up, but it is less secure and only masquerades the guest's virtual NIC as
the host's NIC. Using a virtual switch gives you more flexibility in
networking your guests. The default configuration on most solutions is
to use a single default virtual switch for all guests that is uplinked
to one of the host's NICs. Now, most solutions even have the ability
to use VLANs on their virtual switch. The process of VLAN-ing involves
labeling a client NIC with a unique ID so it communicates only with
other computers that use the same VLAN ID. VLANs on a virtual switch
can exist solely on the host or span other guests and devices on the
physical network (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10974f7.large.jpg"><img src="10974f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. VMware's Highly Flexible Networking Options
</p></div></div><p>
Although VLANs provide an additional security layer to the virtual network,
they are limited to layer 2 (switching) functions. Because of this,
vendors have developed products to provide additional protection at a
virtual layer 3 (routing) and above. Vyatta's vRouter and vFirewall act
as a networking layer between the hypervisor and its guests to provide
layer 3 protection for VMware, XenServer and KVM systems. VMware also
has developed similar functionality with its vShield technology and the
resulting products. When you can extend layer 3 functionality
to your virtual environment securely, you can deploy guests safely as edge or
even public-facing devices.
</p><p>
Additionally, be sure to monitor virtual network activity. You can monitor
external traffic leaving the host using traditional sniffing, IDS
and packet capture methods. Things get a little more difficult when you
try to sniff interhost or interguest traffic, as the hypervisor makes
very different types of network-related calls between guests from what it
would with other devices on a network. As a result, traditional methods
of sniffing won't work. However, products that can sniff this traffic,
like Network Instruments' Observer, are beginning to pop up. Observer can
sniff virtual traffic inside the host and redirect it to a physical port
for analysis by an IDS, IPS or other external monitoring system.
</p><p>
In this short overview, you can see that securing a virtual environment
from every angle requires a lot of work and knowledge. Just like any
other new technology, there is a learning curve for administrators. If
you add the fact that not all of the technology is fully mature,
the curve becomes steeper and the risks greater. Don't be hesitant to
embrace virtualization though. For now, it seems to be the future
of the industry, so we probably will all have to take the plunge. If you educate
yourself about the technology and its limitations, and keep abreast
of current trends, you'll be just fine. As you progress in knowledge
and experience with virtualization, you will find it easier to identify
those areas at risk of exposure and take the appropriate precautions. The
recommendations made here are a good start. If you follow them, you should
be able to minimize your risks and rest a little bit easier when deploying
your virtualized solutions.
