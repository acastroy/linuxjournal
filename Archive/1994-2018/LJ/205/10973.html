Armitage and Metasploit let you attack your network like skilled
criminals. Use these attacks to evaluate your security posture.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270a2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Your boss calls you into her office. You stare at the fake mahogany
panels that line her wall. She strikes a match and asks, &ldquo;Did you see the
news? Criminals broke into our competitor's network. Embarrassing.&rdquo; She
lights her cigar and demands, &ldquo;I want you to test our network and tell
me that we're safe!&rdquo;

</p><p>
Many are finding themselves in this position. The Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standard requires a penetration test each
year. Sarbanes-Oxley, FISMA and HIPAA demand an annual security
review. Because of these pressures, many organizations are looking at
penetration testing.
</p><p>
A penetration test is a step beyond a
vulnerability assessment. A
vulnerability assessment pairs missing patches and configuration errors
with vague threat descriptions. A penetration test requires exploiting
vulnerabilities to learn how an attacker may get access to key systems
and files.
</p><p>
By following this article, you'll evaluate your security posture using the
same process skilled attackers follow. You'll learn how to perform
reconnaissance, exploit hosts and maneuver deeper into your network. To
do this, you'll use Armitage and Metasploit.
</p><p>
Metasploit is an open-source exploit development framework
owned by Rapid7. Armitage is one of the interfaces available for
Metasploit. Armitage makes it easy to launch exploits and conduct
post-exploitation steps once you have access to a host.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270a720"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Use BackTrack Linux to follow this article. BackTrack Linux includes
Metasploit and its dependencies. Update your Metasploit installation to
get the latest version of Armitage:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /pentest/exploits/framework3
svn update .
</pre>
</p><p>
To start Armitage:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/mysql start
./armitage
</pre>
</p><p>
Click Start MSF when the GUI comes up. Armitage will execute Metasploit
in the background and connect to it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10973f1.large.jpg"><img src="10973f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Armitage User Interface
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows the Armitage user interface; it has three parts.
The top-left is the module browser. Use this browser to search
for and execute any of Metasploit's modules. The top-right is the
targets area. Armitage displays your hosts here. The bottom is the tabs
area. Armitage opens each shell, console and browser in a separate tab.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270ab98"></a>
Reconnaissance</h2></div></div><p>
Attackers perform reconnaissance to learn your network
configuration. Accurate information allows them to execute targeted
attacks. Use reconnaissance to learn how attackers see your
network. Attackers want to know which hosts are on your network, which
ports are open and what software you're running.
</p><p>
Nmap is a popular reconnaissance tool. It scans your network to report
open ports and service banners. Nmap also guesses host operating systems
using irregularities in TCP/IP packet headers. Click Hosts&rarr;Nmap Scan&rarr;Quick Scan (OS Detect) to scan your network. Once the scan is complete,
Armitage populates its targets area with your hosts. Click View&rarr;Targets&rarr;Table View to display your hosts in a table if you have a
lot of hosts.
</p><p>
Right-click a host and select Services to see the results of your
scan. Armitage displays the open ports and service banners in a
new tab. Highlight multiple hosts to display your scan results in one
tab. Figure 2 shows a scan of my network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10973f2.large.jpg"><img src="10973f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Network Services
</p></div></div><p>
Execute the reconnaissance step from both inside and outside your
network. Outside reconnaissance will show you how attackers see
your network. You'll learn what your firewall blocks and which services
display too much information to anonymous users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270af60"></a>
Exploitation</h2></div></div><p>
It's time to exploit your network. You need to match your hosts and
services against Metasploit's 640+ exploits. The next sections in this article 
discuss automatic, semi-automatic and manual ways to do this. You
also will learn how to launch password-guessing and client-side attacks.
</p><p>
I recommend using your inside scans for this phase of the penetration
test. You should assume attackers will get inside your network
perimeter. I also recommend attacking hosts from inside your network
perimeter. This will better show what attackers can do. I justify
these recommendations in the pivoting section.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270b0c0"></a>
Automatic Exploitation</h2></div></div><p>
Armitage's Hail Mary feature uses your scan results to launch exploits
automatically. Go to Attacks&rarr;Hail Mary&rarr;by port. Armitage 
finds, filters and sorts exploits into an optimal order. Armitage
then launches these exploits against each of your hosts.
</p><p>
At the end of this attack, Armitage lists the compromised hosts
and the successful exploits. This attack is noisy, and some exploits
may crash a service before the correct exploit reaches it. However,
this attack requires little skill to run. Try this attack from outside
your network to see what your intrusion-detection system finds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270b278"></a>
Semi-Automatic Exploitation</h2></div></div><p>
Use Attacks&rarr;Find Attacks&rarr;by port to get exploit
recommendations. Armitage creates an Attack menu (Figure 3) for each
host with relevant exploits. These are the same exploits launched by
the Hail Mary attack. Right-click a host in the targets area to reach
this menu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10973f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Attack Menu
</p></div></div><p>
Armitage organizes each Attack menu by exploitable service. On my network,
I have a Windows XP SP2 host. To exploit it, I right-click the host and
navigate to Attacks&rarr;smb&rarr;ms08_067_netapi. This opens the launch
dialog shown in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10973f4.large.jpg"><img src="10973f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Exploit Launch Dialog
</p></div></div><p>
The exploit launch dialog has a table of preconfigured
options. Double-click any value to edit it. Click Show advanced options to
see other options. Most of the time you don't need to change these. Click
Launch to run the exploit against your target. If the attack succeeds,
your target turns red with lightning bolts around it
(Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10973f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Compromised Host
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270b958"></a>
Mind the Risk</h2></div></div><p>
Exploiting services is a risky business. You're introducing input into
your applications that executes flawed code paths. When possible, you
should test nonproduction systems. If you must test against a production
host, it helps to understand Metasploit's exploit rating system.
</p><p>
Metasploit rates each exploit as poor, normal, good, great or excellent.
Excellent rated exploits use simple command injection flaws. These are the
safest and most reliable exploits. Exploits rated great are reliable memory
corruption exploits. These may crash your system, but it's extremely
unlikely. Exploits rated good and below have more risk associated with them,
and they're less reliable. Armitage's Hail Mary and exploit recommendation
features use exploits rated at the great and excellent levels only. You can
change this through Armitage&rarr;Preferences.
</p><p>
Metasploit rates some exploits as manual. These exploits need extra
information, such as a user name and password, to launch. Manual exploits
are not available using the automatic and semi-automatic approaches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x270bb10"></a>
Manual Exploitation</h2></div></div><p>
Manual exploitation requires matching your devices and services to
Metasploit modules. This step requires some preparation. Create an
inventory of your network devices and the software running on each host.
</p><p>
Type each software package and device into the search field below
the module browser. Press Enter to execute the search. If you know
a Linux host is running ProFTPD 1.3.3, type ProFTPD into the search
field. Armitage displays all matching modules in the module browser.
</p><p>
Highlight hosts in the targets area to preconfigure the module's RHOSTS
option. Double-click a module to open its launcher. Click Launch to run
the attack.
</p><p>
You sometimes will see auxiliary modules in your search results. Figure 6
shows a search for Cisco. This search reveals auxiliary modules to scan
for known authorization bypass vulnerabilities and access configuration
files using SNMP. Pay attention to the auxiliary modules. They offer a
lot of attack value.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10973f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Cisco Modules
</p></div></div><p>
The manual exploitation approach is the best way to learn what
capabilities Metasploit has against your network. This approach requires
more time and skill to get access, but it's also more thorough.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x27027c0"></a>
Password-Guessing Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
Metasploit also has modules to run a dictionary-based password-guessing
attack against most services. Search for _login in the module browser
to find these modules. To attack SSH, highlight several hosts in the
targets view and double-click the ssh_login module.
</p><p>
Metasploit gives you a lot of flexibility for executing password-guessing attacks. Set the USERNAME and PASSWORD options if you want
to try one user name and password. Set USERPASS_FILE to a file with
&ldquo;username password&rdquo; entries on each line. Or set USER_FILE and PASS_FILE
to attempt access using every user name from USER_FILE with every password
from the PASS_FILE.
</p><p>
Metasploit comes with several user name and
password word lists. On BackTrack, they're located
in /pentest/exploits/framework3/data/wordlists. Double-click a
file-expecting option name (for example, PASS_FILE) to set the option using a
file-chooser dialog.
Click Launch to begin the password-guessing attack. Armitage displays the attack's progress 
in a new tab.
</p><p>
Metasploit stores successful logins in its database. Go to View&rarr;Credentials to see them. You can use these credentials to log in to a
host as well. Right-click a host, select Login, and choose the service
to log in to. If the login yields a session, the host turns red with
lightning bolts (just like a successful exploit). A session is an active
shell or agent that you can interact with.
</p><p>
Password-guessing attacks are an important part of a penetration test. You
should verify that common user name and password combinations do not
give access to your network resources. Also, guessed credentials make
other attacks possible. For example, the snmp_login module might find
a community string that an attacker uses to write a new configuration
file to your Cisco device.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x2702ad8"></a>
Client-Side Exploitation</h2></div></div><p>
To use exploits and launch password-guessing attacks, attackers need
network access to your services. A configured firewall will stop many
attacks. However, attackers are not out of options. Determined attackers
will use client-side exploits and social engineering to get inside your
network's perimeter.
</p><p>
Go to Attacks&rarr;Browser Attacks&rarr;multi&rarr;java_signed_applet to
launch a cross-platform client-side attack. This attack starts a Web
server with a malicious Java applet. The applet asks visitors to grant
the applet full rights to their local system. Disguise this applet as
a neat game, and you may get access to a lot of hosts.
</p><p>
Use Attacks&rarr;Evil Files&rarr;windows&rarr;adobe_pdf_embedded_exe to
generate a PDF file with an embedded executable that connects back to
Metasploit. This attack asks users to take an action that runs this
embedded executable. Most users are unaware of the security risks with
opening a PDF file.
</p><p>
Click Attacks&rarr;Browser Autopwn to start a Web server that will use the
browser fingerprint of each visitor to send an exploit. If you e-mail
every user in your organization with this link, how many hosts would
you compromise?
</p><p>
I recommend testing these client-side attacks on your workstations
and seeing what's possible. User education is the best defense against
these attacks. Consider demonstrating these attacks at your next training
event. Users who can recognize attacks will add to your security posture.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x2702d40"></a>
Pivoting</h2></div></div><p>
One compromised host allows attackers to attack your network from
the inside.
Metasploit's pivoting feature allows you to bounce your attack traffic
through a compromised host. Pivoting makes client-side attacks very
dangerous.
</p><p>
Pivoting works like a router within Metasploit. You choose a network
and set a compromised host as the gateway. Metasploit uses these routes
for all of its attacks and scanning modules. Right-click a compromised
host and navigate to Meterpreter&rarr;Pivoting&rarr;Setup to configure this
feature. Armitage shows a green line between pivot hosts and their known
targets (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10973f7.large.jpg"><img src="10973f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Targets with Pivoting
</p></div></div><p>
Metasploit has a built-in proxy server. Use this if you want to use an
external tool, like Firefox, through the pivots you have set up. Go to
Armitage&rarr;SOCKS Proxy to launch this feature.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x27030b0"></a>
Post-Exploitation</h2></div></div><p>
Post-exploitation is what happens after access. A successful attack
gives you shell access on non-Windows hosts. Successful Windows
exploitation gives you access to Meterpreter.
</p><p>
Meterpreter is a powerful post-exploitation agent built in to
Metasploit. Meterpreter runs from the memory of the process you
attacked. Through it, you can browse and download files, view processes,
take screenshots, log keystrokes, run privilege escalation exploits
and interact with a command shell.
</p><p>
Armitage provides an intuitive interface for much of Meterpreter's
functionality. Figure 8 shows the file browser. Right-click a compromised
host and navigate to the Meterpreter menu to explore these functions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10973f8.large.jpg"><img src="10973f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. File Browser
</p></div></div><p>
Meterpreter is powerful, but Armitage has a few tricks for shell access
too. Right-click a compromised host and navigate to the Shell menu. Select
Interact to open the command shell in a tab. Use Upload to upload a file
using the UNIX printf command. Choose Disconnect to close the session.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x2703478"></a>
Pass the Hash</h2></div></div><p>
After post-exploitation, you'll want to compromise more hosts. Pass the
hash is a technique for further compromising a Windows network.
</p><p>
Windows hosts do not pass your network credentials in the clear. Rather,
they use a challenge-response scheme to generate a hash. Windows uses
this hash to authenticate you on the Active Directory domain. Windows
hosts cache and re-use hashes to authenticate to other hosts on the
network. This saves you the trouble of retyping your password when you
access a file share. Attackers use stolen hashes to get access to other
hosts on your active directory domain.
</p><p>
Dumping cached hashes requires local administrator access. Use
Meterpreter&rarr;Access&rarr;Escalate Privileges to try several local exploits to increase
your privileges. Go to Meterpreter&rarr;Access&rarr;Dump Hashes to steal
the local cached credentials.
</p><p>
Now you need targets. Use the auxiliary/windows/smb/smb_version module
to find other Windows hosts on the Active Directory domain.
</p><p>
Go to Attacks&rarr;Find Attacks to generate an Attack menu for each
host. Highlight several Windows hosts, right-click, and use Attacks&rarr;smb&rarr;pass
the hash. Armitage lets you choose which set of
credentials to try. Pick a pair and click Launch. You've passed the
hash. Each successful login will give you a Meterpreter session.
</p><p>
Patches exist for Metasploit's Windows privilege escalation exploits.
Attackers who compromise a patched system don't have to stop
though. They may scan for an unpatched host, exploit it and then carry
out these steps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x2703738"></a>
Evaluating the Risk</h2></div></div><p>
Earlier, I defined a penetration test as a way to learn how attackers
may get access to key systems and files. I suspect you did not find
a working exploit for your key servers. Before you conclude your network
penetration test, I'd like you to think like an attacker for a moment.
</p><p>
Attackers will use social engineering and client-side attacks to get a
foothold. Attackers then will try to exploit a workstation to collect
hashes. Using pass-the-hash, your patched Windows systems are no longer
safe. What happens if attackers access your workstation, install
a key logger and download your SSH keys? One vulnerable host can lead
to a total compromise of your otherwise secure assets.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2612580.0x2703898"></a>
Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I've shown you the techniques attackers use against your
network. You learned how to scan your network, exploit hosts and carry
out post-exploitation actions. You also learned how to maneuver deeper
into your network using the pass-the-hash technique. The next step is
to apply what you have learned.
</p><p>
I recommend that you download the Metasploitable virtual
machine. Metasploitable has many services you can exploit for shell
access and information. Attack Metasploitable to become familiar with
Armitage and Metasploit before you start your first penetration test.
