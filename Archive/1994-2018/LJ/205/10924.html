Cfengine is well known as a powerful system configuration management
tool, but did you know you also can use it to secure your systems?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1166580.0x125e2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Cfengine, from the start, has had security as a key part of
its design and use scenarios. Here, I demonstrate how
Cfengine 3 can be used to increase the security of a Linux
system by monitoring file checksums, monitoring filesystems
for suspicious filenames, monitoring running processes,
monitoring open ports and managing sshd.conf.
</p><p>
Because Cfengine 3 is under active development, I suggest 
you install the latest version from the Cfengine Source
Archive (see Resources).
</p><p>
The purpose of this article is to give practical examples
of how you can use Cfengine to increase security
on a Linux system. See the Quick Start Guide in the Resources
section of this article for help in learning the Cfengine
language. (I don't provide a tutorial on the Cfengine
language here.)
This article is based on Cfengine version 3.1.5a1.

Monitoring File Checksums</h2></div></div><p>
Cfengine 3.1.4 shipped with 214 unit tests that can 
double as examples of Cfengine's functionality.
They are installed to /usr/local/share/doc/cfengine/.
I've adopted unit_change_detect.cf into detect_changes_in_etc.cf (Listing
1).

Run this with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cf-agent -KIf detect_changes_in_etc.cf
</pre>
</p><p>
cf-agent is the component of Cfengine that actually
makes changes to the system. (There are other components
to serve files, monitor system activity and so on.
cf-agent is the piece that makes changes to the system,
and the one you'd use to start learning Cfengine.) In the command above:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
-K &mdash; tells cf-agent to ignore time-based locks and allows you
to run cf-agent repeatedly (no &ldquo;cool-off&rdquo; period, which
might otherwise kick in to prevent system overload).
</p></li><li><p>
-I &mdash; tells cf-agent to inform you of its actions and any changes
made to the system.
</p></li><li><p>
-f &mdash; specifies the policy filename.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
On the first pass, cf-agent builds a file information
database containing file timestamps and inode numbers and
builds an MD5 hash for each file. You should see
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cf-agent -KIf detect_changes_in_etc.cf
  !! File /etc/hosts.allow was not in MD5
     database - new file found 
  I: Made in version 'not specified' of
     'detect_changes_in_etc.cf' near line 22
  ...
#
</pre>
</p><p>
There are two messages here, alert and info.
</p><p>
Cfengine prefixes its output to help you understand
what kind of output it is (in other words, metadata): 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Informational messages start with &ldquo;I&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Reports start with &ldquo;R&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Alerts start with !! or ALERT.
</p></li><li><p>
Notice of changes to the system starts with -&gt;.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In the above case, the alert message is accompanied
with an info message about the policy that was in 
effect when the alert was produced, its version
number (if supplied) and the line number.
</p><p>
I didn't specify the version number, but the line
number is useful. Line 22 is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
changes      =&gt; detect_all_change,
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the line responsible for Cfengine adding
/etc/passwd to the MD5 database. It tells Cfengine
what to do about changes&mdash;to detect them.
</p><p>
Now, I run cf-agent again, and it runs quietly. The contents
of /etc match the MD5 sum database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cf-agent -KIf detect_changes_in_etc.cf
# 
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I edit /etc/hosts.allow to add &ldquo;sshd: ALL&rdquo;
to simulate an unauthorized change.
Watch cf-agent scream:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cf-agent -KIf detect_changes_in_etc.cf
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ALERT: Hash (MD5) for /etc/hosts.allow changed!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 -&gt; Updating hash for /etc/hosts.allow to
MD5=2637c1edeb55081b330a1829b4b98c45
I: Made in version 'not specified' of
'./detect_changes_in_etc.cf' near line 22
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ALERT: inode for /etc/hosts.allow changed
38901878 -&gt; 38901854
ALERT: Last modified time for /etc/hosts.allow

2011 -&gt; Mon Jan 31 08:00:02 2011
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# 
</pre>
</p><p>
There are three alerts:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
MD5 hash changed (because the contents changed).
</p></li><li><p>
The inode number changed (when vi saved the file).
</p></li><li><p>
The modification time changed (when vi saved the file).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Reminder: messages about actions that Cfengine takes are
prefixed with &ldquo;-&gt;&rdquo;:


<pre     class="programlisting">
 -&gt; Updating hash for /etc/hosts.allow to
MD5=2637c1edeb55081b330a1829b4b98c45
</pre>
</p><p>
You can set up Cfengine to complain via e-mail or syslog,
so even if the intruder tampers with the MD5 database, the
alarm will sound. In commercial versions of
Cfengine (Nova), you can set up multiple Cfengine nodes
to share their MD5 databases and monitor and cross-check
each other.
</p><p>
You can run this check fairly often&mdash;every five minutes, if you
like and if your hardware will sustain it. (Computing lots of
MD5 sums can be expensive on CPU and disk I/O.) Is the
added security worth it to you?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1166580.0x125f958"></a>
Monitoring for Suspicious Filenames</h2></div></div><p>
Cfengine has a special cf-agent control variable called
<tt  >suspiciousnames</tt>. You can put a list of names
into it
to warn about during any file search (such as was done
during the MD5 hash check). If Cfengine sees these
names during recursive (depth) file searches, it will
warn about them. If <tt  >suspiciousnames</tt> is not set,
cf-agent won't check for them. It's not set by default.
</p><p>
Let me demonstrate how this works by adding the following
control block to detect_changes_in_etc.cf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
body agent control
{
suspiciousnames =&gt; { ".mo", "lrk3", "rootkit" };
}
</pre>
</p><p>
A cf-agent control block controls the behavior of cf-agent.
This is where you can set things like dry-run mode
(don't change anything but report only on what changes would
have been made&mdash;useful for learning Cfengine), the largest
file size Cfengine will edit and so on. So the
<tt  >suspiciousnames</tt>
variable is set in the agent control block. It's an array
of strings.
</p><p>
Let's create a suspiciously named file to see cf-agent
get excited:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# date &gt; /etc/rootkit
# cf-agent -IKf detect_changes_in_etc.cf
Suspicious file rootkit found in /etc
#
</pre>
</p><p>
So, if you're scanning your system directories for an MD5
hash check, you can add the suspicious name check too.

Monitoring Running Processes</h2></div></div><p>
I follow the best practice of securing servers by
disabling unnecessary services. I often want to make
sure my Web servers are not running CUPS&mdash;usually,
a Web server does not need to print!
</p><p>
The example shown in Listing 2 is based on the Cfengine
unit test unit_process_kill.cf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1166580.0x1658180"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. cups_not_running.cf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
body common control

{
bundlesequence  =&gt; { "cups_not_running"  };
}


########################################


bundle agent cups_not_running {


    processes:

            "cupsd"  signals =&gt; { "term", "kill" };

}
</pre></div><p>
The line of interest in Listing 2 is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
processes: "cupsd"  signals =&gt; { "term", "kill" };
</pre>
</p><p>
This means if there is an entry in the process table matching
&ldquo;cupsd&rdquo;, that process will be sent TERM and then KILL
signals:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# cf-agent -IKf cups_not_running.cf
 -&gt; Signalled 'term' (15) to observed process match '28140'
 -&gt; Signalled 'kill' (9) to observed process match '28140'
#
</pre>
</p><p>
But, let's not be so brutal. Cfengine can report suspicious process
names. You can keep an eye out for password sniffers, crackers, IRC bots
and so on with the policy shown in Listing 3.

  "suspicious_process_names" slist =&gt;
      {

body process_select proc_finder(pattern)

     command =&gt; ".*$(pattern).*";

     process_result =&gt; "command";
}
</pre></div><p>
The key line here is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vars: "suspicious_process_names" slist =&gt; { "sniff",
    "eggdrop", "r00t", "^\./", "john", "crack" };
</pre>
</p><p>
A variable called &ldquo;suspicious_process_names&rdquo; is a list
of strings; what we deem as suspicious process names
includes, let's say, any processes starting with ./.
As you can see, this list can include regular expressions.
Cfengine uses Perl-compatible regular expressions.
</p><p>
You can set the contents of this array to reflect what
you consider suspicious process names.
Then, Cfengine scans the entire process table (that's the
<tt  >processes: .*</tt>)
and loops over the contents of the &ldquo;suspicious_process_names&rdquo; array.
Cfengine has implicit looping over arrays, so if you have an array
@{suspicious_process_names} and you reference ${suspicious_process_names},
you're actually saying:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for ${suspicious_process_names} in (@{suspicious_process_names}
do
  ...
done
</pre>
</p><p>
That's what happens when you say <tt  >process_select  =&gt;
proc_finder("$(suspicious_process_names)");</tt> You're actually saying,
for each element in @(suspicious_process_names), find processes that
match that regex.
</p><p>
Anyway, I want this to be a security demonstration rather than a language
primer, so let's continue:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cf-agent -IKf report_suspicious_process_names.cf
 !! Matched: root     20044 20002 20044  0.0  0.0  
    4956  19   664    1 22:05 00:00:00 ./eggdrop 
#
</pre>
</p><p>
The first numeric field (20044) is the PID. The last field is the process
name. (Why is there an IRC bot on my Web server?)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1166580.0x1658cd8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Case Study</b></p><p>
In 2000, David Ressman and John Valdes of University of Chicago reported
in a LISA paper &ldquo;Use of Cfengine for Automated, Multi-Platform Software and
Patch Distribution&rdquo; how they detected a cracker using similar functionality
in Cfengine 2:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Since the people who break into our systems almost exclusively use the
compromised systems to run sniffers, IRC bots, or DoS tools, we decided to
make up a list of suspicious process names to have Cfengine look for and warn
us about every time it ran. Besides the usual suspects (more than one running
copy of inetd, anything with &ldquo;sniff&rdquo;, &ldquo;r00t&rdquo;,
&ldquo;eggdrop&rdquo;, etc., in the
process name, password crackers, etc.), we had Cfengine watch for any process
with &ldquo;./&rdquo; in the process name.
</p><p>
One afternoon, we got an e-mail from Cfengine on one of our computers that had
noticed that the regular user of that machine was running a program as
&ldquo;./irc&rdquo;. It wasn't uncommon to see our users using
&ldquo;./&rdquo; to run programs,
nor do we have objections to our users running IRC, but in this case, it was a
bit unusual for this particular user to be running an irc process (good UNIX
system administration practice also dictates that you know your users).
</p><p>
Poking around the system, we discovered that the person running this program
was not the regular user of the machine, but was someone who had evidently
sniffed our user's password from somewhere else and remotely logged in to his
system just minutes before Cfengine had alerted us. This person was in the
process of setting up an IRC bot and had not yet tried to get a root shell. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
You can add to your defense-in-depth by monitoring for suspicious process
names.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1166580.0x1659308"></a>
Monitoring Open Ports</h2></div></div><p>
You can increase your security situational awareness by knowing
on what ports your server is listening. Intruders may install an FTP server
to host warez or install an IRC server for bot command and control.
Either way, your server's TCP profile has changed (increased) in
terms of on what TCP ports it listens.
</p><p>
By constantly comparing desired and actual open TCP ports, Cfengine
quickly can detect an intrusion. Cfengine 3 runs every five minutes
by default, so it can detect a compromise pretty fast.
</p><p>
The code example shown in Listing 4 starts with hard-coded lists of what
TCP ports and corresponding process names are expected on the system:
<tt  >22 sshd 80 httpd 443 httpd 5308 cf-server</tt>. It then
uses <tt  >lsof</tt> to
get the actual list of TCP ports and process names, compare them
and report <tt  >DANGER</tt> if the comparison fails.

Managing sshd.conf</h2></div></div><p>
The next example is Diego Zamboni's Cfengine bundle for editing
the sshd configuration file and restarting sshd if any changes were 
made.
It has two parts (to abstract the under-the-hood details).
In the first part, the sysadmin edits the sshd array to set
variables corresponding to the sshd configuration parameters.
For example, to mandate Protocol 2 of SSH, set:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"sshd[Protocol]" string =&gt; "2";
</pre>
</p><p>
If the parameter is commented out, Cfengine uncomments it and
sets it to the desired value.
If the parameter is absent, Cfengine adds it and sets it to the 
desired value.
Additionally, if any changes were made to sshd_config, sshd
restarts to activate the change.

For an example of changes made, run <tt  >diff</tt> of sshd_config before and after
Cfengine edited it to set Protocol, X11Forwarding and UseDNS:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# diff /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.cf-before-edit
14c14
&lt; #Protocol 2,1
---
&gt; Protocol 2
95,96c95,96
&lt; #X11Forwarding no
&lt; X11Forwarding no
---
&gt; X11Forwarding yes
&gt; X11Forwarding yes
109c109
&lt; #UseDNS yes
---
&gt; UseDNS no
#

</pre>
</p><p>
You may notice X11Forwarding is there twice after the edit, 
because it was in the file twice before the edit, once 
commented and once uncommented. But, this does not break
things. Having <tt  >X11Forwarding yes</tt> is valid syntax, and
the <tt  >/usr/sbin/sshd -t</tt> syntax checker does not complain.
</p><p>
You also may notice that cf-agent saved a copy of the original file,
just in case.
