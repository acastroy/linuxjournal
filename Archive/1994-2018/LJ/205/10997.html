&ldquo;Statistics with R&rdquo;</h4><p>
Joey Bernard's &ldquo;Statistics with R&rdquo; was a very welcome and
useful piece [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, March 2011]. As an instructor, I noticed a
very interesting on-line GNU-licensed statistics &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; based on R,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>IPSUR</em></span>. Although available in &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; PDF
format, it is also available &ldquo;live&rdquo;
as a Lyx+Sweave file. I was never really able to get Lyx and Sweave to work (I
use plain-vanilla Lyx all the time). There are instructions on-line, but I
could not get them to work for me. Maybe it's too specialized for a column
(is it?), but maybe you have suggestions.

Work the Shell Request</h4><p>
I have a request for Dave Taylor: do a series on system admin scripts. I
have been doing basic bash stuff for years, but have several scripts that
are quite a bit more complex&mdash;specifically, wrapper functions for things
like database queries that can be included into any script or grabbing the
output of stderr, getting the exit codes from commands and acting on them.
I personally find these a challenge and would benefit from some expert
experience. Keep up the good work.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
George   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for your note,
George. It's always great to get
reader mail (as long as it's not complaining that I don't handle spaces in
filenames properly).
</p><p>
I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about here though. Can you give me a
more specific example of what you're trying to accomplish?

Second-String Desktop</h4><p>
I just wanted to comment on the desktop manager article by Shawn Powers
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, February 2011]. The memory usage stated by Shawn from the screenshots are
not the actual amounts used by the system and applications. The amount in
the article is the physical memory used. In Linux, unused resources are
considered wasted, so the kernel will cache as much memory as it can for
faster access. To get the amount of memory being used by the system, we
have to look at the used column for -/+ buffers/cache. And, the free column
on this same row is the amount available for applications.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mohamed King  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks for the tip. My main point in comparison is how much physical RAM
was used. Because that is such a critical point for low-end systems, it's
what I wanted to concentrate on. I took the snapshot immediately after the
system booted, and even if memory was freed afterward, it still loaded up
that much RAM at first, which would be a problem for low-end systems. You
are correct that the kernel is amazing at managing memory, which is why I
took my snapshot on a fresh boot.&mdash;Ed.

Linux for Science Column</h4><p>
I would like to second Kwan Lowe's comments in the March 2011 Letters regarding
Joey Bernard's new column. I <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> it. Being a computer scientist by trade,
and having
worked in engineering data processing/presentation at Boeing labs and wind
tunnel
for more than 20 years, I love working with and learning about data
analysis tools and processes.
</p><p>
If <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> would give Joey a couple more pages to work with, maybe some
articles
on CFD and Finite Elements might be fun. Also, generating fractal
landscapes
and some basic 3-D rendering (PovRay) are always fun to play with.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jim Phelps  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Joey Bernard replies:</em></span> I know that a lot of CFD people use the Ansys
products, but I'd like
to keep these pieces focused on open-source software. I have 
a piece on getting started with OpenFOAM on my list, so keep on the lookout
for that. As for longer pieces, that depends on how much space is
available in any given issue. I'll let Shawn and the rest of the
editorial team figure out what the best balance is for all the
readers.

Checking RAID Status</h4><p>
In the February 2011 Letters section, David N. Lombard suggests to check
RAID status periodically by making a cron job with a command similar to
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# echo check &gt; /sys/block/md0/md/sync_action
</pre>
</p><p>
I think that this is good advice, but I'd suggest that users should check
whether their distribution already ships with a similar solution.
For example, Ubuntu Karmic does have a cron job in /etc/cron.d/mdadm that
calls a script located at /usr/share/mdadm/checkarray every week that does
exactly what David suggested. It also has other convenient features,
such as checking whether the MD device is idle before issuing a
&ldquo;check&rdquo; command.

Tips for Finding Your Phone</h4><p>
This is to thank Daniel Bartholomew for the article &ldquo;Finding Your Phone,
the Linux Way&rdquo; in the November 2010 issue. It was very useful.
</p><p>
Regarding triggering the &ldquo;lost-phone-actions&rdquo; on the phone, I think an
important method is missed. One can send an SMS to the phone (when one
feels it's lost) and trigger these actions.
</p><p>
The advantages for this compared to the suggested methods are that you won't need a
Web site, and the phone won't need to poll it to trigger these
actions. The phone can respond back by replying to the trigger SMS (with
GPS coordinates and so on) giving you flexibility as compared to
hard-coding the recipient. One also may specify an e-mail ID to respond to in
the SMS, so that the phone can send GPS coordinates and/or photos in that
e-mail
ID.
</p><p>
Look at SMSCON (<a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=60729" target="_self">talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=60729</a>), although
I have not tried this out myself.

Home Server Series</h4><p>
Just a quick note to pass along how much I'm enjoying Kyle Rankin's article
in the March 2011 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> regarding setting up a home server.
The first paragraph was too ironic, in that I've been preaching that
same thing to people for some time now&mdash;the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; sounds nice, and
Canonical and others are putting a lot of effort in that direction, but it
may not be as universally accepted as they might think or hope. 
</p><p>
I bought Kyle's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Server</em></span> book a while back and set up a server and
network in our home, and it works great. It's just a Samba file server
for Ubuntu and Mac machines, but it stores all of our family pictures,
videos and so on. Thanks to Kyle for providing such clear guidance in that book
on how to set it up!
</p><p>
I'm just an airline pilot (not in the computer industry) hacker, educated
long ago as an aero engineer, so all of this is self-learning. When I
first gave Linux a try, I did get some bad reviews about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
and ended up spending lots of money for two of the British periodicals,
even though they tend toward the tabloid at times. The feedback
I got then was that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> was &ldquo;just for heavy business servers
people&rdquo;, and that an individual wouldn't find much use with getting it.
Your direction is clearly to improve that image, and I do enjoy what
else <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> has included lately.
</p><p>
So thanks. You've been a great help already. I'll sign off by asking
Kyle to keep this series that he's starting. It's useful for the little people
as much as more Linux-competent types, and I encourage the editors to
keep broadening the scope of the magazine as well. I do enjoy getting
it every month.
Keep up the great work!
