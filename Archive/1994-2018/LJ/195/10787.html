In this third Lightning Hacks roundup, check out how to automate
screen connections, build reverse tunnels and use the elusive SSH command
line.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2027408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Every year or so, I like to write a column I title &ldquo;Lightning
Hacks&rdquo;. This
column is inspired by the lightning talks common at most conferences. In
a lightning talk, instead of having one speaker give a 60-minute
presentation, multiple speakers give short 5&ndash;10-minute presentations. By
the end of a lightning talk, you end up hearing about all sorts of cool
topics that wouldn't have gotten their own time slot. In this column, I
get a chance to talk about a few cool &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; I've run across that
wouldn't fill an entire column by themselves.
</p><p>
In prior Lightning Hacks columns, I've covered a number of different
topics,
but this time I've decided to focus on only one: SSH. Like many system
administrators, I spend a great deal of my day within SSH sessions, and
over the years, I've found a few shortcuts and handy tips that I save
in shell scripts so I don't forget them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x20276c8"></a>
Automatically Load Screen-Like Sessions</h2></div></div><p>
This first hack seems really simple&mdash;after all, I am adding only one
extra flag to SSH. Normally, if you want to <tt  >ssh</tt> into a machine and run
a program, you simply pass the program at the end of your SSH command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh user@remotehost.example.org df
</pre>
</p><p>
Yet, if you ever have tried to write a shell script that would
automatically <tt  >ssh</tt> in to a remote machine and launch mutt or screen or
similar programs, you have seen the session either sit there or exit
with some message like &ldquo;Must be connected to a terminal.&rdquo; I ran into this
problem on my N900 palmtop when I wanted to launch two special terminal
sessions: one that automatically reconnected to a remote screen session
and another that loaded mutt. Yeah, that's right. I still prefer mutt
and irssi, even on a palmtop. Neither worked though until I added the -t flag:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh -t user@remotehost.example.org screen -dr
$ ssh -t user@remotehost.example.org mutt
</pre>
</p><p>
The first example connects to the remote host and re-attaches my remote
screen session (I run only a single screen session on my host and then
use Ctrl-a c to create windows within that session). The second example
simply runs mutt. The -t flag forces pseudo-tty allocation. It turns out
that when you run programs like screen or mutt, you need to force SSH to
create a pseudo-tty.

Route around Bothersome Firewalls</h2></div></div><p>
I know a million articles have been written about SSH
tunneling, but this particular type of tunneling is so useful; however, I
use it infrequently and forget the proper syntax. A problem you often 
may run into is needing to <tt  >scp</tt> a large number of files between
two servers (let's say londonweb1 and seattleweb1), but for some reason,
the two machines are firewalled off from each other. Usually, you have
one server that is able to <tt  >ssh</tt> into both machines (let's call that
server admin1), and if it were just one or two files that needed to be
transferred, you could copy the files first from londonweb1 to admin1,
then from admin1 to seattleweb1.
</p><p>
When you need to transfer multiple files (or perhaps pipe dd traffic)
between the two sites, it can be impractical, if not impossible, to move
data to an intermediary server first. That's where SSH reverse tunnels
come in handy. With a reverse tunnel, you launch an SSH session from
your intermediary server (admin1 in this case) to the first server
(londonweb1) and open up a local high port that is unused, such as 2222.
Then, you tell SSH to tunnel all traffic on that port over to the remote
server (seattleweb1). Once the tunnel is set up, you can use scp as
you normally would, except you point it to localhost port 2222.
</p><p>
To set up the tunnel, I would run the following command from admin1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kyle@admin1:~$ ssh -R 2222:seattleweb1:22 londonweb1
</pre>
</p><p>
The arguments to -R can be easy to mix up. Note that the last server in
the command (londonweb1) is the server to which I log in. The first argument to
-R is the port to open up on that server (2222). The next two arguments
list to which server and port to forward any traffic (seattleweb1 and
22, respectively).
</p><p>
Once I log in to londonweb1, I can use scp (or rsync) like I normally
would, but I point it to localhost port 2222:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kyle@londonweb1:~$ scp -r -P 2222 /var/www/mysite localhost:/var/www/
</pre>
</p><p>
When I initiate this scp command, all the traffic enters the
tunnel and goes to admin1, and then from there, it is forwarded to port
22 on seattleweb1. Keep in mind that this means if these machines are
far apart, your bottleneck will be the slowest link between the servers.
</p><p>
If you are a security-minded individual in charge of a network,
you may not like how easy it is to route around your basic firewall
rules. It's important to realize that reverse tunnels also can be used
to connect from inside your network to a person's home machine, so even
with incoming firewall rules set, a user still could tunnel in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f2f580.0x2027fb8"></a>
Adding SSH Tunnels on the Fly</h2></div></div><p>
A lesser-known feature of SSH is that you can enter an internal
command-line mode in an existing session and add extra tunnels. Let's say
you already have an SSH session open from admin1 to londonweb1, and
now you want to add the reverse tunnel without having to log out. First,
press ~C (that's the ~ character and then a capital C) to open the SSH
command line. Then, you can add extra port-forwarding commands as though
they were part of the original SSH command line. When you are done, simply
press
Enter to return to the regular shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kyle@londonweb1:~$ 
ssh&gt; -R 2222:seattleweb1:22
Forwarding port.

kyle@londonweb1:~$
</pre>
</p><p>
This also could be useful if you use regular SSH tunnels (the -L option)
as a poor-man's VPN and realize that, for instance, you need to set up
an extra VNC or RDP tunnel to a new server. When you use the SSH command
line, you won't have to close and break any existing sessions you have.
