Selling Linux in the Enterprise often is a tough job, but with
the right information, you can start making the case for Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd49580.0xe412a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For far too long, Linux has existed on the periphery of enterprise computing.
Whether it is skepticism of open-source technology,
a preference for paid instead of community support or the ever-forking
tree of distributions, many businesses have shied away from Linux. In
recent years, commercial Linux vendors have been hard at work polishing
their distributions in the hope of establishing a beachhead in the
enterprise. These mature distributions have rendered many past criticisms
moot, and coupled with new opportunities in emerging technologies
like virtualization, Linux stands poised to re-establish itself as an
enterprise-caliber operating system. However, if these vendors are to be
successful, they must take on the leviathan in the enterprise: Microsoft.
</p><p>
In this article, I discuss several areas of the enterprise that are
prime candidates for Linux adoption or expansion. In
each case, I look at the current Microsoft offering in that area
and then highlight a legitimate Linux-based contender. In doing so, I do
not intend to keep a running score card and come up with an unsurprisingly
biased conclusion (this is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> after all). I merely want to
start the conversation in order to demonstrate Linux's inherent business
value and strengthen the community at large.
</p><p>
There are a few caveats before I proceed. For the purposes of this
article, I have blurred the line between server and desktop platforms to
keep the discussion at a strategic level. The topics I examine may
touch upon aspects of one or both platforms. I also have limited the
distributions used here to those with paid support, as they tend to be
targeted at the enterprise market. With the exception of BIND and DHCP,
I have avoided any technologies/packages, such as LAMP, Samba, Sendmail
or any iconic Linux app I felt already has been beaten into the ground
with comparisons. I want to bring something new to the table. Finally,
this article does not tackle the thorny issue of application serving or
application compatibility. We all know the vast majority of business apps
are developed for the Microsoft platform. Wine and/or Mono are not the
answers. Developing software to emulate another vendor's code always
will leave Linux users behind their Microsoft counterparts. However, the rapid
growth of Web-based apps, advancements in virtualization (application
and desktop) and the arrival of cloud computing may change this dynamic
in the near future as applications become separated from the desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd49580.0xe41568"></a>
Desktop Security&mdash;User Account Control/Security Configuration
Wizard</h2></div></div><p>
User Account Control (UAC) has been an essential part of Microsoft OSes
since Vista. UAC protects the OS by requiring services and programs
to operate with the correct permissions via security confirmation
prompts. It is meant to limit the number of programs that run with
unnecessary administrative privileges, a long-criticized weakness of
applications developed for the Microsoft platform. Although UAC has received
praise for making strides to eliminate this weakness, many admins have
found that prolonged use leads some users simply to click Yes on the
elevation prompts rather than evaluate the security risk. This leads to
the elevation of non-desired programs, possibly to the detriment of the
system. UAC can be complemented with the use of the Security Configuration
Wizard that locks down unnecessary ports and services using a form-like
survey to determine your minimum necessary configuration.
</p><p>
Security always has been an important component of the Linux
pedigree. Utilities like sudo and chroot, which limit the context
of certain programs and operations, long have been part of the Linux
security toolbox. In the case of Debian-based distributions, root access
is prohibited except through the use of sudo. Also, most distros now
utilize either AppArmor or SELinux as an additional security layer at the
host level. Although SELinux and AppArmor take different tacts to securing
a system, each utilizes a least-privilege-based approach to minimizing
the threat surface through the use of profiles. Although SELinux (Figure
1) has the distinction of being developed by the National Security
Agency and of being extremely secure, it can be difficult to administer. By
contrast, many admins believe AppArmor is just as effective and easier to
configure. Novell includes a nice GUI tool for AppArmor in SUSE Enterprise
Linux that includes a wizard for profiling applications that is a real
time-saver (Figure 2).

Host-Based Firewalls&mdash;Windows Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
The Windows firewall included in Server 2008 and Windows 7 is a great
improvement over previous incarnations. It filters on packets, IP
addresses and source/destination program, and its management GUI is easy
to use. However, it lacks some of the advanced features found in
Linux-based firewalls. In contrast, Linux has been wed to open-source firewall
development in near lockstep since ipchains and now iptables. Although
many admins still prefer the text-based administration of iptables, there are
many easy-to-use GUI-based interfaces, such as the one found in SUSE
through Yet another Setup Tool (YaST, Figure 3). Unfortunately, these
tools often limit access to advanced features, such as port redirection,
IP translation and quality of service, which can be accessed from the
command line. To be fair, some of these capabilities are available in
Server 2008 by adding other modules (RRAS) or products (ISA), but that
adds another layer of administration and cost where Linux possesses them
out of the box. Some admins may feel that firewalls are not a significant
factor in enterprise security except in the perimeter. Others suggest
that firewalls are more important now than ever, because technologies like
the cloud and mobile computing are erasing the traditional boundaries
of the perimeter. Only time will tell.

Package Management/Updates&mdash;Automatic Updates/Windows Software Update
Services</h2></div></div><p>
The last decade easily could have been labeled the Decade of
the Patch. Because of the ever-evolving security landscape, new
vulnerabilities are discovered daily. Don't get me wrong. Security
researchers provide an invaluable service to the industry, but sometimes when
I have to push patches en masse daily, I pine for the old days when I could
just push a single service pack every so often. Patching is not solely a
Microsoft phenomenon. Vulnerabilities exist in Linux as well. Most modern
operating systems worth their salt include a native updating mechanism
to address flaws and vulnerabilities. In Windows, it is Automatic Updates
for individual systems or Windows Software Update Services (WSUS) for
managing a large number of systems. Microsoft has done well with both
programs and should be applauded for their maturation in the last five
years. Like its name implies, Automatic Updates automates the patching
of host systems through a Control Panel interface. WSUS adds reporting
features and the ability to centralize patch distribution, although the
process for approving, denying and/or superseding patches can be kludgy.
</p><p>
Linux updating mechanisms vary by distribution, but share similar
functionality with their Microsoft counterparts. Debian-based systems have
apt, Red Hat-based systems have Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM), and
SUSE has YaST (which provides a graphical front end to the ZYpp package management engine).
Each tool is easy to automate and includes the ability
to resolve dependency issues prior to an update. They also share the
ability to deploy local repositories to reduce bandwidth consumption as
with WSUS, but to achieve the nicer dashboard and reporting features
of WSUS requires subscription-based services, such as Red Hat Network
(Figure 4) or Landscape from Canonical (Figure 5).

Basic Network Services&mdash;Microsoft DNS/DHCP</h2></div></div><p>
DNS and DHCP are production network roles where many Linux servers make
their entry into an enterprise. Although these services may seem boring,
they form the backbone of the modern enterprise. On the Microsoft side, we
have the proprietary versions of DNS and DHCP included in Server 2008.
Both are configured using the Server Manger utility and then administered
through their respective mmc consoles. Microsoft has integrated
its versions of DNS and DHCP deeply with Active Directory (AD) and a multitude
of its proprietary network services. Although on the surface this may not
seem like a problem, a single misconfiguration can affect multiple parts
of the Microsoft infrastructure (AD, Exchange and so on). On the Linux
side, we
have the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND), the standards-based market
leader. BIND is a dependable workhorse that has enough flexibility to
support Active Directory and keep DNS administration separate from other
parts of the infrastructure. You can administer BIND through the command
line or GUI tools like the Red Hat BIND Configuration Tool (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10727f6.large.jpg"><img src="10727f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Red Hat's BIND Configuration Tool
</p></div></div><p>
Alongside DNS, DHCP is a critical, though overlooked network service. It
also is an excellent springboard for Linux in a new environment. It
is low impact and can integrate into almost any existing network with
little interruption. DHCP is available in most distros, and tools like
those found in YaST make administration a snap (Figure 7). DNS and DHCP
usually can be combined on a single server, as is found in many Microsoft
environments, but with a smaller footprint.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10727f7.large.jpg"><img src="10727f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Directory Services&mdash;Active Directory</h2></div></div><p>
Active Directory is the heart of Microsoft networking. It is
a powerful tool that has a solid reputation for providing reliable
directory services. Chances are, unless you are already a *nix shop,
you're probably using it right now. AD has dominated the landscape for so
long that many people forget its roots. In the strictest sense, AD is an
LDAP-based server that uses Kerberos for authentication and DNS for name
resolution. The reason for its dominance is twofold: its flagship mail
product (Exchange) requires it, and every Microsoft desktop and server
OS shipped has a built-in AD client. Directory services existed before
AD, and other alternatives are available
(even non-Linux ones) that provide similar services. 
</p><p>
One of the better
alternatives is eDirectory from Novell (Figure 8). eDirectory has its
roots in Novell Directory Services (NDS), the highly popular directory
service that dominated the enterprise in the 1990s. Although Novell
has lost considerable market share to AD in the last decade, it has
continually improved its directory products. eDirectory is scalable,
supports multimaster replication and is OS-agnostic, which means it can
easily be deployed to almost any environment (including Windows). For
Linux systems, eDirectory can run on either SUSE or Red Hat Enterprise servers.
eDirectory can be managed by using ConsoleOne (Figure 8) or the newer, sexier iManager Web
management package (Figures 9 and 10) that uses role-based assignment
of privileges. This is similar to AD; however, the level of granularity
over directory permissions found in iManager is far greater. As a side
note, Novell currently has a standing relationship with Microsoft that
each will support the other's products. This could be a benefit when
campaigning for a bigger Linux presence in a Microsoft-centric enterprise.

Virtualization&mdash;Microsoft Hyper-V</h2></div></div><p>
Virtualization may be the hottest topic in the industry at the moment. It
seems like &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; is the buzzword of every other Webinar out there. I
won't spend time explaining the value of virtualization, save that
server consolidation and desktop/application virtualization seem to
be the biggest reasons so many people are interested in it. Microsoft
made a major move into the virtualization arena with its release of
Hyper-V. Unlike Microsoft's earlier product, Virtual Server, Hyper-V
sports a fully virtualized hypervisor that removes the need for running
a virtual server on top of a &ldquo;fat host&rdquo;. Hypervisors allow guests to
access underlying hardware directly, and because there is very little
overhead, performance is dramatically improved. Hyper-V has received a
number of improvements with the release of Server 2008 R2. It now has
more enterprise-grade capabilities for management and high availability,
and most notably, support for live migrations. It can be managed with the
Hyper-V Manager Console, an enterprise-grade tool for creating and
managing Hyper-V hosts and guests.
</p><p>
There are Linux-based options for virtualization as well. For the longest
time, Xen was the darling of the Linux virtualization movement. Following
the acquisition of Xen by Citrix, many vendors have begun making the
switch to using the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) module as their primary
virtualization platform. KVM is a hypervisor module that can run in a
kernel of 2.6.20 or higher, but it does require a compatible vm-enabled
processor. Red Hat, formerly a huge supporter of Xen prior to its
acquisition, has tied its wagon to KVM. In fact, Red Hat is releasing
its KVM-based Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) product as a
direct competitor to Hyper-V, VMware and Xen. RHEV is composed of
a minimalist RHEL KVM-enabled installation, tweaked as a host system
for virtualization. Unlike most virtualization products on the market,
RHEV is rolling out a competitive subscription-based pricing model that
includes both the hypervisor and manager software in the same license
(often sold separately). It also touts advanced virtualization features,
such as live migration and automatic server failover. I really wanted
to test-drive RHEV for this article, but I was unable to obtain a trial
version of the product. Regardless, KVM runs near flawlessly in most distributions.
For demonstration purposes, I deployed KVM on Ubuntu, which
provides a Just enough OS (JeOS, pronounced &ldquo;juice&rdquo;) image configured
specifically for virtual appliances.
KVM hosts can be managed using the GUI-based virt-manager
package (Figure 11) or other command-line tools.

Cloud Computing&mdash;Microsoft Azure/Cloud Computing Initiative</h2></div></div><p>
Cloud computing is almost as buzzworthy as virtualization, which is funny
considering that it is an offshoot of the virtualization movement. Cloud
computing refers to a strategy of using a pool of resources (such as servers,
storage, bandwidth) or a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; to offer individualized servers or
services to customers. Cloud services usually pertain to Web-based
application services, but more and more apps are appearing &ldquo;in the
cloud&rdquo;.
These newer apps include corporate e-mail hosting, file storage,
user collaboration and mobile apps. Clouds are a cost-beneficial
proposition for smaller customers that want the advantages of a data
center (clustering, high availability/disaster recovery) without the
cost of maintaining one. Amazon has been a pioneer in this area with its
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service where you can purchase your own cloud
servers or applications that run within the Amazon cloud. Microsoft has
jumped into the market and poured considerable resources and energy
into the emerging technology. It has been live with its public cloud,
Azure, since 2009. Microsoft's private cloud, which will be managed
through System Center, is scheduled for release in the first half of 2010.
</p><p>
If you want to deploy a private Linux-based cloud now, you can do so
with Ubuntu. The process is remarkably simple. Download Ubuntu server
and launch the server install process. Upon boot, you will see an
option from the main install screen to install the server as a Ubuntu
Enterprise Cloud (UEC) server either as a cluster controller or as a
node. You will need one of each to get started. Once up and running,
you can download images from the management site (Figure 12) or begin
creating your own images that match your cloud needs. The cloud you
are deploying actually is a re-branded version of the open-source cloud
software Eucalyptus. Management is accomplished via command-line or GUI-based tools like hybridfox (Figure 13), a Firefox add-in that runs like
a modified version of Amazon's Elasticfox management utility.

Many other areas of the enterprise are ripe for Linux
penetration. The ones presented here represent some of the best chances
for Linux adoption in the vast majority of enterprises. I encourage
you to download and test these options to see how beneficial they can
be to your business. Linux's future development, its very survival,
rests in its ability to stake a claim in the business computing market,
and the only way to do that is by constantly challenging the status quo
with viable, cost-saving alternatives. Hopefully, I've given you some
of those alternatives here.
