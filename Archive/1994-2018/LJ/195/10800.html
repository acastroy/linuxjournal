Moving beyond the horizontal.

Old analog televisions had controls called horizontal and vertical. One
kept the picture from falling over sideways, while the other kept the
picture from sliding off the top or the bottom of the screen.
</p><p>
I think we need similar controls in our heads when we look at the product
categories we call markets.
</p><p>
In the world of free software and open source, we mostly care about the
horizontal: creating code, standards and other means for expanding markets
sideways, toward the horizons. We work to keep both developers and users
free from capture in the vertical markets we call silos, so they can do
more stuff in more ways. We don't often ask &ldquo;Where would we be without
silos?&rdquo; because we know. We would be free to build and use anything we
want, out in the market's wide-open spaces.
</p><p>
Still, innovation happens in silos too. Many of the technical graces we
take for granted would not have happened outside the walls of silos built
by Apple, Canon, IBM, Intel, Sony and other large companies with ample and
hardened intellectual property portfolios. Linux itself was developed
originally (and still primarily) for Intel's x86 CPUs. Much of what we take
for granted in chips from Intel and other makers is thick with intellectual
property protections we would hate to see applied to our own software work.
Every large maker of original electronic products (including all the
companies listed above) produces between dozens and thousands of new
patents every year, adding to portfolios that muscle licensing income and
deals of many other kinds. Occasionally, companies do battle in court, but
most of the time the dealing is quiet. If revealed, it is only through pro
forma small-print disclosures in documentation.
</p><p>
What matters is that these portfolios give large makers the confidence and
security they feel is required to produce original and appealing goods for
which there is little or no competition. This is an ideal to which Apple,
for example, constantly aspires. Back in 1997, not long after Steve Jobs
returned to lead Apple after a long interregnum, he killed off cloners of
the company's computers. Here's what I wrote about it at the time in an
e-mail to Dave Winer (which Dave later published):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
To Steve, clones are the drag of the ordinary on the innovative. All that
crap about cloners not sharing the cost of R&amp;D is just rationalization.
Steve puts enormous value on the engines of innovation. Killing off the
cloners just eliminates a drag on his own R&amp;D, as well as a way to
reposition Apple as something closer to what he would have made the company
if he had been in charge through the intervening years....
</p><p>
Now Steve is back, and gradually renovating his old company. He'll do it
his way, and it will once again express his Art.
</p><p>
These things I can guarantee about whatever Apple makes from this point
forward:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
It will be original.
</p></li><li><p>
It will be innovative.
</p></li><li><p>
It will be exclusive.
</p></li><li><p>
It will be expensive.
</p></li><li><p>
Its aesthetics will be impeccable.
</p></li><li><p>
The influence of developers, even influential developers like you, will
be minimal. The influence of customers and users will be held in even
higher contempt.
</p></li></ol></div></blockquote></div><p>
The iPod, iPhone and iPad each not only fulfilled all six of those
requirements, but also redefined their market categories in the vertical
dimension. That is, they grew the range of things that could be done with a
given device, and the size of its marketplace. The iPhone in particular
redefined the smartphone market and enlarged it far beyond the narrow
range of possibilities allowed by combinations of mobile phone makers and
mobile phone companies. New kinds of applications by the thousands burst
out of the ground like a geyser. But all are contained inside Apple's silo,
where they move only through the company's sphinctered approval and sales
processes.
</p><p>
In fact, far more can be done on Linux (notably Android) and Symbian OSes
than on iPhone's, just given the open nature of the former and the closed
nature of the latter. But, thanks to Apple, there is much more to imagine
doing outside that company's closed and private silo.
</p><p>
This is the point at which some suggest that open-source goods are
derivative, rather than original. But that's not the case. We still happen to
live in a time when investment in closed, and original stuff is
greater than investment in the open and original kind. As long as that's
still the case, we'll have the Apples of the world aiming for the heights
while the rest of us build out the widths and the depths that characterize
wide-open marketplaces.
