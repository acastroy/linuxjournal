Getting started with CouchDB, an increasingly popular non-relational database.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x291a580.0x2a12358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The surge in interest in non-relational databases&mdash;often known
collectively as NoSQL&mdash;is now impossible for Web developers to
ignore. Whether you are looking at a non-relational database for
reasons of scalability, availability, cost, performance or just
because it's a shiny new toy, there's no denying that serious Web
developers need to consider non-relational options when designing an
application. In the past few months, every project on which I've
worked has at least considered a non-relational solution, even when
the final decision was to use a relational database.
</p><p>
In the previous two installments of this column, I looked at MongoDB,
an object (or &ldquo;document&rdquo;) database with a somewhat relational feel.
MongoDB stores objects, but its query language should look somewhat familiar
to those of you who have long used relational databases. If you're
willing to consider a more radical departure from the world of
relational databases and query syntax, instead of using the map-reduce
paradigm, easy replication and a straightforward RESTful API, you
might want to consider CouchDB, now part of the Apache Software
Foundation. Even if you don't use CouchDB in production environments,
you may find (as I do) that its use of JavaScript, coupled with its
implementation of map-reduce, helps you think in new and different
ways about old problems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x291a580.0x2a12618"></a>
CouchDB Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Downloading and installing CouchDB is extremely easy. If it's not
available via a simple <tt  >apt-get install</tt> (or the yum equivalent) for
your system, or if you simply prefer to install a source version, you
can download it from the CouchDB home page at
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org" target="_self">couchdb.apache.org</a>. The version I'm running is 
slightly out of date (0.10), rather than the latest production version
at the time of this writing (0.11). Nevertheless, the differences aren't
that great, especially for the simple examples shown here.
</p><p>
After I installed CouchDB with apt-get, I started it with the following standard
command on my server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/couchdb start
</pre>
</p><p>
That starts the CouchDB server on port 5984. By
default, this means I can access the CouchDB server as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http://127.0.0.1:5984/
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are interested in accessing your CouchDB server from another
system, you can modify the CouchDB configuration file
(/etc/couchdb/default.ini on my machine) by going to the
&ldquo;httpd&rdquo; section
and replacing the name-value pair:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bind_address = 127.0.0.1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x291a580.0x2a12a38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
with your IP address instead of 127.0.0.1 (that is, localhost). Restart
CouchDB, and it will be accessible not only to local HTTP clients, but
also across the Internet.
</p><p>
Obviously, starting a CouchDB server on its well-known port and
without any security restrictions is asking for trouble. If you are
running a production instance of CouchDB, you should ensure that it
cannot be accessed or modified by the general public. CouchDB comes
with basic authentication options that make it possible to restrict
access to databases, and you should look into those before deploying
your system to a public server.
</p><p>
If you point your Web browser to your CouchDB server at port 5984, you
will see the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"0.10.0"}
</pre>
</p><p>
This response tells you several things. First, you see that all
communication in CouchDB takes place using JSON, the JavaScript object
notation that has become a lightweight method for communication among
Internet applications. Although CouchDB is written in Erlang, an
open-source language designed for distributed processing, nearly
everything associated with it uses JavaScript. Functions (as you soon will
see) are written in JavaScript, and both inputs and outputs are
sent using JSON.
</p><p>
CouchDB is also RESTful&mdash;it uses the entire vocabulary of
HTTP verbs to describe what should happen and a URL to indicate the
object on which the action should take place. Most people are
familiar with HTTP's GET and POST verbs, but less so with PUT and
DELETE. CouchDB uses all of these, combining HTTP, JSON and REST for
rich effect.
</p><p>
Thus, when you point your Web browser to your CouchDB server on port
5984, asking for the document /, you actually are issuing a GET request
for the document named /. CouchDB's response describes the server,
rather than an individual document. The response is an object
(equivalent to a &ldquo;hash&rdquo; or &ldquo;dictionary&rdquo; in languages such as Perl,
Ruby or Python) with two keys. The first, &ldquo;couchdb&rdquo;, simply says
&ldquo;Welcome&rdquo;. The second, named &ldquo;version&rdquo;, tells
you the version of the
server that is running&mdash;in this case, 0.10.0.
</p><p>
Let's change the URL somewhat, going instead to the URL /_utils. If
you go to that document, you'll see a much more interesting response.
Indeed, rather than receiving JSON, you will get a full-fledged Web
page, with a CouchDB logo in the top right. This is Futon, the
CouchDB Web-based interface. It is sometimes called the
administrative interface, but it is also quite useful for
experimenting with the database.
</p><p>
Along the right side of the main Futon page is the main
&ldquo;tools&rdquo; menu.
It normally comes up in the overview mode, but you can switch to a
number of other screens by clicking on them. Most interesting to me
is the test suite, which provides a Web-based interface to ensure
that your CouchDB installation is working correctly. Although it is
unlikely that your system has any problems, you still might want to
run the test suite, just for personal satisfaction and thoroughness.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x291a580.0x2a13068"></a>
Creating and Populating a Database</h2></div></div><p>
Going back to the overview screen, you should see a prompt at the
top saying create database. Just as with most relational database
systems, a single server may contain more than one database. Each
database then may contain any number of documents, each of which has a
unique ID and any number of name-value pairs.
</p><p>
So to get started, you need to create a new database. Click on
the link, and an AJAX dialog box opens up, asking for the name of the
database. I'm going to assume a database name of &ldquo;atf&rdquo; for this
column, although you might want to choose something closer to
your own name or interests. You may use any alphanumeric characters
(plus some symbols) for a database name, keeping in mind that a
leading underscore is used by internal CouchDB systems, meaning that
you should avoid such names for your own work.
</p><p>
After you create a database, you'll be brought to the browse
database page. Click on the new document button to create a new
document. CouchDB automatically gives the new document a unique
ID value (key name &ldquo;_id&rdquo;). You may change the ID to one of your
liking, if you have a unique numbering or naming scheme that you
prefer.
</p><p>
Then, you may add as many name-value pairs as you like, by clicking on
the add field button. The name is assumed to be a string, but the
value may be any legitimate JSON value&mdash;a number, string, array or
object. If you enter an array (within square brackets) into the
interactive Futon interface, upon completion, it will be 
represented visually as an array. The same is true with a JSON object. After
you enter it, the name-value pairs are displayed in an easy-to-read
format.
</p><p>
Once you have added some fields to your document, click the save
button.
</p><p>
I added a number of fields to a document describing me. The fields
tab in Futon shows me these values in a nice, easy-to-edit format. If
I want to see the document in its native JSON, I can click on the
source tab and see it there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{
   "_id": "0534ca63b70beb02d24b62ec4fe72566",
   "_rev": "4-bea8364f4536833c1fd7de5781ea8a08",
   "first_name": "Reuven",
   "last_name": "Lerner",
   "children": [
       "Atara",
       "Shikma",
       "Amotz"
   ]
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that in addition to the fields I already have mentioned,
there is a &ldquo;_rev&rdquo; field. That's because when you save a document, the
old version does not disappear. Rather, CouchDB keeps the old one
around, much as a garbage collector handles memory in high-level
languages, such as Ruby and Python. This means there can be
multiple documents with the same &ldquo;_id&rdquo; field, although only one is
considered current&mdash;the one with the latest &ldquo;_rev&rdquo; field value. The
revision contains an integer as well as an MD5 hash value. You 
normally can look at only the integer to identify the revision, ignoring
the hex portion of the string.
</p><p>
Do not mistake the revision tag as a means of keeping
backups or for
version control. The moment someone compacts a database, all of
the old revisions are removed.
</p><p>
As with other non-relational databases, CouchDB allows you to add,
remove and rename fields whenever you like. Each document in a
database might have its own unique field names, although in practice,
this is fairly rare. It is far more common for each document to have
a common set of fields, perhaps with some variation in special cases.
It is common to say that CouchDB is &ldquo;schemaless&rdquo;, but I think 
it's safer to say that CouchDB (and other NoSQL storage facilities)
allows the programmer to decide on the schema at runtime, rather than
in advance&mdash;much as a dynamic programming language allows you to
determine the type of a variable at runtime, rather than at
compile time.
</p><p>
One thing that obviously is missing from a JSON-based database is the
notion of a foreign key&mdash;a pointer from one document, or record, to
another. There is no built-in facility for linking one document to
another, although there certainly are ways to use information in one
document to view another document.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x291a580.0x2a13748"></a>
Outside Futon</h2></div></div><p>
It's very nice that CouchDB comes with an easy-to-use, browser-based
interface. However, this interface is clearly not what you want to be
using from your applications. As I wrote above, CouchDB communicates
with the outside world using JSON over HTTP. Any action that you just
performed via the browser also should be possible via an HTTP client.
You could use a library for a programming language; every major
language has at least one CouchDB client. But a popular and
easy-to-use option is the curl command-line program.
</p><p>
To send a simple GET request to my CouchDB server, I can write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/
</pre>
</p><p>
And sure enough, I receive the same response as before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"0.10.0"}
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, if something goes wrong, curl won't say much. For that
reason, I generally prefer to use the <tt  >-v</tt> option to curl (and most
other programs, for that matter), which shows me the HTTP request and
response as they take place. It also comes in handy to specify the
HTTP verb you want to use (GET, in this case), so I'll do that with
the -X option. Thus, I can write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
~$ curl -vX GET http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/
</pre>
</p><p>
And I see:


<pre     class="programlisting">

* About to connect() to atf.lerner.co.il port 5984 (#0)
*   Trying 69.55.225.93... connected
* Connected to atf.lerner.co.il (69.55.225.93) port 5984 (#0)
&gt; GET / HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.19.4 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.4
&gt; OpenSSL/0.9.8l zlib/1.2.3
&gt; Host: atf.lerner.co.il:5984
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Server: CouchDB/0.10.0 (Erlang OTP/R13B)
&lt; Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2010 12:03:05 GMT
&lt; Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8
&lt; Content-Length: 41
&lt; Cache-Control: must-revalidate
&lt;
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"0.10.0"}
* Connection #0 to host atf.lerner.co.il left intact
* Closing connection #0

</pre>
</p><p>
You might notice that the &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; response header indicates
that what the server sends back is in text/plain format. So, although you
might see the content as JSON, CouchDB itself indicates that it's
sending plain text. This isn't a big deal, unless you are writing a
program that specifically waits for JSON, so you might need to
modify its expectations a bit.
</p><p>
You can request your Futon URL as well, using HEAD to avoid the long
response:


<pre     class="programlisting">

~$ curl -vX HEAD http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/_utils/

* About to connect() to atf.lerner.co.il port 5984 (#0)
*   Trying 69.55.225.93... connected
* Connected to atf.lerner.co.il (69.55.225.93) port 5984 (#0)
&gt; HEAD /_utils/ HTTP/1.1
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.19.4 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.4
&gt; OpenSSL/0.9.8l zlib/1.2.3
&gt; Host: atf.lerner.co.il:5984
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
&lt; Server: CouchDB/0.10.0 (Erlang OTP/R13B)
&lt; last-modified: Fri, 23 Oct 2009 12:40:09 GMT
&lt; Date: Mon, 12 Apr 2010 12:04:43 GMT
&lt; Content-Type: text/html
&lt; Content-Length: 3158

</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, you get a text/HTML response. And, of course, you know
that Futon sends HTML for its response, because you already have been
using it from a Web browser.
</p><p>
Now, let's try to look at the atf database, which I created earlier, that
contains a single document (that is, record). How can I
retrieve that information?
</p><p>
Well, I can start by asking for the database (leaving off the -v
option now for space reasons):


<pre     class="programlisting">
~$ curl -X GET http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/atf

{"db_name":"atf","doc_count":1,"doc_del_count":0,"update_seq":4,
 "purge_seq":0,"compact_running":false,"disk_size":16473,
 "instance_start_time":"1271067859057749","disk_format_version":4}
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, asking for a database gives basic information about
that database, from the number of documents to the amount of space it
consumes on the disk.
</p><p>
You can retrieve an individual document by using its ID:


<pre     class="programlisting">
~$ curl -X GET
&#8618;http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/atf/0534ca63b70beb02d24b62ec4fe72566

{"_id":"0534ca63b70beb02d24b62ec4fe72566",
 "_rev":"4-bea8364f4536833c1fd7de5781ea8a08",
 "first_name":"Reuven",
 "last_name":"Lerner",
 "children":["Atara","Shikma","Amotz"]}
</pre>
</p><p>
If I want to modify one or more fields in this document, or even add
another field, I can do so with a PUT command. curl's -d option lets
me specify a document on the command line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
~$ curl -X PUT
&#8618;http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/atf/0534ca63b70beb02d24b62ec4fe72566
   -d '{"first_name": "Superman", "middle_initial": "M."  }'

{"error":"conflict","reason":"Document update conflict."}
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, this is surprising. CouchDB is complaining that it cannot
perform the update I need, because there is a conflict. Notice
that it does not report the error using HTTP codes (such as 500), but
rather by sending a JSON object back to me, containing the
&ldquo;error&rdquo;
key.
</p><p>
The reason CouchDB gives an error message here is that I haven't
indicated which revision I am attempting to update. Without such a
revision indicator, CouchDB assumes I have stale data and, thus,
will not allow me to update the document. Only if I send my update
with the current &ldquo;_rev&rdquo; value will the update succeed. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
~$ curl -X PUT
&#8618;http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/atf/0534ca63b70beb02d24b62ec4fe72566
   -d '{"_rev": "4-bea8364f4536833c1fd7de5781ea8a08",
        "first_name": "Superman", "middle_initial": "M."  }'
</pre>
</p><p>
CouchDB responds with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
{"ok":true,"id":"0534ca63b70beb02d24b62ec4fe72566","rev":
&#8618;"5-fe6fccb89b9512d26120fbd63dbb15c4"}
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, the update succeeded, incrementing the revision. If
you try the same update again, you will get the same &ldquo;update
conflict&rdquo;
error message as before, because there can be only one update to a given
revision.
</p><p>
Note that when you <tt  >PUT</tt> an update to a document, you must update the
entire document at once. Unlike the UPDATE command in a relational
database, adding a new revision to a CouchDB document does not modify
individual fields. Rather, it stores an entirely new document with
the same ID and an incremented revision number. This means in
this example, it's true that I have added the &ldquo;middle_initial&rdquo; field
successfully. However, I also have effectively removed the
&ldquo;children&rdquo; field, because I did not specify it in my PUT statement.
</p><p>
You can add an entirely new document to your database using the POST
verb in HTTP. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
~$ curl -X POST http://atf.lerner.co.il:5984/atf
  -d '{"first_name" : "Atara", "last_name" : "Lerner-Friedman"}'
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, I get the following response, indicating that a new
document was created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{"ok":true,"id":"aeb6925eb23278f1b8e530ba67b0172d",
 "rev":"1-f0e336978a368f679ee7b280107bc2fb"}
</pre>
</p><p>
I should add that I had a terrible time trying to use curl to create a
document, all because of the quotes. It seems that you must use double
quotes inside a JSON request (around the names of the keys and
values). Single quotes result in a strange error message
indicating that the UTF-8 encoding for JSON is invalid, which did not
quite point me in the right direction.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
CouchDB is an increasingly popular non-relational database, offering a
great deal of flexibility in storage and retrieval. This month, I
explained how to create databases in CouchDB and do basic storage and
retrieval using both the Web-based Futon interface and curl. Next
month, I will demonstrate writing JavaScript functions that process and display the
data, demonstrating the true power of CouchDB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x291a580.0x2e0cc28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
The home page for CouchDB is at the Apache Project
(<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org" target="_self">couchdb.apache.org</a>). There, you can not only download the
software, but also read documentation, from tutorials to an active wiki.
The CouchDB Web site also has links to drivers for the various
languages you're likely to use when working with CouchDB.
</p><p>
If you're interested in the JSON format used by CouchDB, you can learn
more about it at the main Web site: <a href="http://json.org" target="_self">json.org</a>.
</p><p>
Finally, two good books on CouchDB were released in the past few
months. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning CouchDB</em></span> by Joe Lennon and published by Apress is
aimed more at beginners, but it has a solid introduction to CouchDB,
Futon and how you might use the system. <span   class="emphasis"><em>CouchDB: The Definitive
Guide</em></span> by J. Chris Anderson, Jan Lehnardt and Noah Slater, published
by O'Reilly, is a bit more advanced and meaty, but it might not be
appropriate for beginning users of non-relational databases.
