Think implementing a large monitoring service is tedious? Not so with
Zabbix. Start monitoring several-dozen critical hardware and services
quickly.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x13702a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Zabbix (<a href="http://www.zabbix.com" target="_self">www.zabbix.com</a>) is an open-source, commercially backed
monitoring solution that supports UNIX, Linux, BSD, Mac OS X and Windows
platforms and is built to support large installations. Zabbix is the
creation of Alexei Vladishev and his company Zabbix SIA. This article is
based on the latest version of Zabbix, version 1.8.1, which was released
in January 2010. At the time of this writing, most Linux
distributions include the previous version (1.6) in their repositories.
There are significant changes when compared to 1.8, but most of this
article still applies. A partial feature list includes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Distributed monitoring.
</p></li><li><p>
Clients for Linux, BSD, Windows, Mac OS X and commercial UNIXes.
</p></li><li><p>
Database back end (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL or SQLite).
</p></li><li><p>
Auto-discovery mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Web-based interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Notifications via e-mail, SMS or Jabber.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for polling or trapping Zabbix client messages.
</p></li><li><p>
SNMP.
</p></li><li><p>
Agent-less monitoring (ping, port checks and so on).
</p></li><li><p>
Graphs.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although you can install Zabbix from your Linux distribution's
repositories, I'm going to install version 1.8.1 from source using
Ubuntu 9.10 for the server platform with a MySQL database back end. I
also show how to configure a Linux client with the basic monitoring
that comes with a default Zabbix installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x1370c48"></a>
Prerequisite Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Before compiling the Zabbix sources, I need to install prerequisite
packages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
shell&gt; sudo apt-get install mysql-server apache2 
 &#8618;libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php5-gd 
 &#8618;libmysqlclient15-dev libsnmp-dev libiksemel-dev 
 &#8618;libcurl4-gnutls-dev
</pre>
</p><p>
(In Ubuntu, the package names are mysql-server, apache2, libapache2-mod-php5,
php5-mysql, php5-gd, libmysqlclient15-dev, libsnmp-dev, libiksemel-dev and
libcurl4-gnutls-dev.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x1370e00"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The Zabbix sever and client will run as the user zabbix, so you need to
create an account:

<pre     class="programlisting">
shell&gt; sudo useradd -s /bin/true zabbix
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, create the zabbix database:

<pre     class="programlisting">

shell&gt; mysql -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt;
mysql&gt; create database zabbix;
mysql&gt; quit;

</pre>
</p><p>
Download the source code from <a href="http://www.zabbix.com/download.php" target="_self">www.zabbix.com/download.php</a>,
uncompress the archive and then follow the steps below to set up the
database schema and default configuration. Note that I am
using the MySQL schema files to set up my database; there are different
schema files for the other supported databases:


<pre     class="programlisting">

shell&gt; sudo tar zxvf zabbix-1.8.1.tar.gz
shell&gt; cd zabbix-1.8.1/create/schema
shell&gt; cat mysql.sql | mysql -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; zabbix
shell&gt; cd ../data
shell&gt; cat data.sql | mysql -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; zabbix
shell&gt; cat images_mysql.sql | mysql -u&lt;username&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; zabbix

</pre>
</p><p>
To compile the server code, <tt  >cd</tt> back to the root of the extracted
zabbix-1.8 source directory, and run the following command to compile the
server binaries to have support for MySQL, SNMP and Jabber:


<pre     class="programlisting">
shell&gt; ./configure --enable-server --with-mysql --with-net-snmp
 &#8618;--with-jabber --with-lib-curl
shell&gt; sudo make install

shell&gt; ./configure --enable-agent --enable-static
shell&gt; sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
I recommend building static binaries for the clients. This helps when deploying the client across different (Linux) versions. Although
the <tt  >make install</tt> command builds and installs the server
binary zabbix_server, it does not build the client agent
binary. To compile the client binaries, <tt  >cd</tt> into
zabbix-1.8.1/src/zabbix_agent, and run another <tt  >make
install</tt>.
The binaries then are installed into /usr/local/sbin&mdash;the same location
for the server binary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
shell&gt; ./configure --enable-agent --enable-static
shell&gt; cd src/zabbix_agent
shell&gt; sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Two zabbix binaries are compiled: zabbix_agentd and zabbix_agent. The
latter is used to run the client from a superserver, such as inetd, and
the former runs as a d&aelig;mon. It's recommended to run the zabbix_agentd.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x13714e0"></a>
Server and Client Configurations</h2></div></div><p>
Zabbix uses one configuration file for the server and another for the
client. Sample configuration files are available in
the zabbix-1.8.1/misc/conf directory. Make a directory called /etc/zabbix,
change the ownership of the directory to the user zabbix, and copy the
zabbix_server.conf and zabbix_agentd.conf files to this directory.
</p><p>
There isn't much to change in either of the configuration files, but
they are well documented within the files themselves. Two configuration
parameters in the client zabbix_agentd.conf file that should be changed
are the lines <tt  >Server=</tt> and
<tt  >Hostname=</tt>.
The first should point to your Zabbix server and the second
should be the hostname of the client.
</p><p>
With the exception of maybe the DBUser and DBPassword parameters in the
zabbix_server.conf file, nothing else needs to be changed if you're
running a site with less than a few hosts. Look
through both configuration files and refer to the Zabbix documentation
for any variables that could be helpful to your site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x1371748"></a>
Startup Scripts</h2></div></div><p>
You can find several startup script examples within the
zabbix-1.8.1/misc/init.d directory. Copy the one for your installation
to /etc/init.d, and make any necessary changes. For Ubuntu, I used the
scripts located in the debian directory. In both the server and agent
configuration files, I needed to change the location of the binary from
/home/zabbix/bin to /usr/local/sbin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x1371850"></a>
Zabbix Web Front End</h2></div></div><p>
The zabbix-1.8.1/frontends/php directory contains the Web-based front end
to Zabbix. Copy this directory structure somewhere below Apache's
DocumentRoot, and load that URL in your Web browser. You will be
greeted with the Zabbix Introduction screen (Figure 1). This
wizard-like page steps through your configuration and presents you
with a License Agreement. The next screen details any configuration
changes that need to be made before continuing, such as PHP memory and
execution time settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10235f1.large.jpg"><img src="10235f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Zabbix Introduction Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Once past the configuration screen, the main login screen loads. The
default account is Admin with the password zabbix. Of course, once
you're logged in, change the default password. The
front-end layout consists of two rows of options (Figure 2). Click 
Administration, then Users. Make sure the pull-down menu located on
the right side of the screen has Users selected instead of User
Groups. Next, click on the admin user. A configuration page for the
Admin user is shown (Figure 3). First, change the
password. Also, add an e-mail address (click Add next to the Media
line), as we're going to configure alerts to be sent via e-mail later
in this article.

Adding a Host</h2></div></div><p>
Three files need to be copied to a new client: the zabbix_agentd client
binary to /usr/sbin, the zabbix_agentd.conf configuration file to
/etc/zabbix and an init script. Edit the zabbix_agentd.conf configuration
file, and change the line that reads <tt  >Server=</tt> to equal the
Zabbix server name, and change the <tt  >Hostname=</tt> line to equal the client
hostname. Once completed, start up the zabbix agent with the init
script. 
</p><p>
Back on the Zabbix server Web page, click Configuration&rarr;Hosts within the Web front end.
Make sure Hosts is selected in the pull-down menu on the right-hand
side of your screen, and then click the Create Host button. The Hosts
configuration screen appears (Figure 4). You can give your host any
name you choose, but I recommend staying with the short hostname
(<tt  >hostname -s</tt>) instead of a fully qualified domain if you can. Add it
into the Linux servers group, and populate the DNS name with the fully
qualified DNS name. I could choose to monitor this host with its IP
address, but I'll trust that DNS always will be up to date. The only
other change to this page is to click Add under the Linked templates
area. Click the radio button next to Template_Linux and choose Select
at the bottom of this pop-up window. Back at the Host screen, click
Save. All the monitoring Items and Triggers included in the
Template_Linux will be added to the client.

</p></div></div><p>
The Zabbix monitoring structure starts with Items (checks or
collects data), then Triggers (monitors data in Items) and finally, Actions
(e-mail, SMS or run scripts).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x176a5a0"></a>
Items</h2></div></div><p>
Items can be considered the &ldquo;data
collectors&rdquo;. Some items are
built in
to the agent binary, and others will be custom scripts. After
installing Zabbix, you will have a range of templates that contain these
Items for common operating systems checks, such as Linux, Solaris, MAC OS
X and Windows systems.
</p><p>
Let's look at the template we used with our first client. Using the
Global search box at the upper right-hand side, search for
&ldquo;Template_Linux&rdquo;. The search results should return a page that has links to
the Items, Triggers or Graphs for this template (Figure 5). Select the
Items link. All these Items will be monitored on any host that has the
Template_Linux template applied to it, such as the first host
configured above.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10235f5.large.jpg"><img src="10235f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Template_Linux
</p></div></div><p>
Click the Item called Free disk space on /. Here are all the details
for this Item (Figure 6). Most fields are self-explanatory, but here
are few important ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Description:
a free form field that describes the check. Note that in the free
disk space check there is a $1. Zabbix replaces this with the first
field in the key (explained later).
</p></li><li><p>
Type:
a Zabbix agent type is a check preformed by the agent
running on the client at defined intervals. A Zabbix agent check is
compiled in the binary, such as checking free disk space, number of
free/used inodes or a custom written script. Another type is a Zabbix
Trapper. A Zabbix Trapper acts like an SNMP trap. Its value is 
updated only when the client sends the update by running the binary
<tt  >zabbix_sender</tt>. For example, say you have a cron job
that takes
30 minutes to finish. Normally, the Zabbix server will timeout waiting
for a response from the client running this script. A better way would
be to add a line in the cron job script to update the Zabbix server when
it's finished using the zabbix_sender program.
Another type of check is called Simple checks. This is used for
agent-less clients&mdash;for example, pinging a host or checking a specific
port (e-mail, SSH and so on) with an external host.
</p></li><li><p>
Key:
this field is the &ldquo;expression&rdquo; that Zabbix will check. It can be a
built-in key, such as the free disk space item (vfs.fs.size[/,free]) or a
custom script that you wrote. The documentation details all the built-in
keys and expressions that can be used.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10235f6.large.jpg"><img src="10235f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Free disk space on / Item
</p></div></div><p>
You also can tell Zabbix what type of data is going to be returned:
text, characters or numbers and a multiplier for that value. Also, you can
specify for how
long you want fine-grained graphs (history) and trends. The
Applications section is where you can group similar checks. For example,
if you were adding another filesystem item, you would add it to the Filesystem application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x176af40"></a>
Triggers</h2></div></div><p>
Select the Triggers link from your Global search results (Figure 5). A
trigger in Zabbix monitors the data that the Items collect. If the data
exceeds a configured threshold, it's assigned to one of six severity levels.
Figure 7 shows the triggers that come with Template_Linux.
Displayed are the severity level, status, description and an
expression that makes up the trigger. Click on the trigger named Low
free disk space on Template_Linux volume /, and the trigger
configuration screen should come up (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10235f7.large.jpg"><img src="10235f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Template_Linux Triggers
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10235f8.large.jpg"><img src="10235f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Trigger Configuration Screen
</p></div></div><p>
The first field, the Name field, should describe the problem.
For instance, &ldquo;IMAP port not responding on server123&rdquo; is better than
&ldquo;E-mail down&rdquo;. This most likely will be the text that you're going to
receive in an e-mail, page or SMS message, so a clear, descriptive name
will be very helpful at 2am should that call occur.
</p><p>
The Expression field is what Item this Trigger is going to monitor and
what its thresholds are. Our expression for this trigger is configured with
<tt  >{Template_Linux:vfs.fs.size[/,pfree].last(0)}&lt;10"</tt>,
which loosely reads, &ldquo;Monitor the host called Template_Linux and its key
vfs.fs.size[/,pfree]. If the last value it returned is less than 10,
assign it a severity level of High.&rdquo; Click Select. From here, you
can change the expression to trigger on averages, absolute values or
maximum values for a period of time. For now, I'll leave the trigger
function as is, except I want to change at what value it triggers. So
close the Condition pop-up window and change the expression to 5% by
changing the value from 10 to 5 at the end of the line. Click Save to
make the changes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1278580.0x176b620"></a>
Actions</h2></div></div><p>
Actions occur when a trigger is activated. They can be via e-mail,
Jabber, SMS message or running a remote script. Let's configure an
action to e-mail the admin if any trigger with level Disaster has been
activated. Select Configuration&rarr;Actions, and then the
Create Action button on the right-hand side of the
screen. The Configuration of Actions screen should
be visible (Figure 9). Name it something helpful, then click the
New button under Action conditions. Choose
Trigger severity from the New Condition area, and
change the severity level from Information to Disaster. Click Add
when finished. Next, select the New button in the Action operations area. Configure the operation to send a
message to a single user named admin (Figure 10). Click Add when done.
Finally, click the Save button. Now, any
trigger that you assign the severity level of Disaster will result in
an e-mail being sent to the Admin user. You can create Actions for a
single trigger from a specific host if needed, but the action above can
be treated like a &ldquo;site-wide&rdquo; action.

Daily Monitoring</h2></div></div><p>
There are several ways to monitor the clients you have configured.
One of the screens I find most informative is the Status of Triggers Web
page. Click Monitoring&rarr;Triggers (make sure Group
and Host have &ldquo;all&rdquo; listed from the pull-down on the right-hand side of
the screen). On this screen, Zabbix lists all the triggers that have been
activated, their assigned severity level, the date of last change and short
description as well as an Acknowledged and Comments column. This
could be considered a sysadmin's to-do list.
