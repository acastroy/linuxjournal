Got lots of systems? Make them into a cloud computing cluster with Eucalyptus!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1f580.0x1e17250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the March 2010 issue, I wrote an article on how you could deploy Ubuntu 9.10 as
part of Amazon's EC2 cloud computing service. Amazon's EC2 service can
be useful, but what if you have a bunch of machines already and don't want
your data outside your network? Or, what if you don't want to pay the ten-cents-per-hour fee that Amazon charges? That's where the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud
comes in. The Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud system ships with the Server Edition
of Ubuntu 9.10, and it's based on the Eucalyptus cloud cluster software.
</p><p>
What exactly is Eucalyptus? Put simply, Eucalyptus is an open-source,
Amazon EC2-compatible, cloud computing cluster package that can be run on
commodity Linux machines. Although VMware and VirtualBox do similar things,
Eucalyptus allows you to scale your cluster across multiple
machines. When
you run out of resources to run another VM, you simply can pop a new
Eucalyptus server on your network, and you're off and running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1f580.0x1e174b8"></a>
Installing Your Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you're all fired up, let's get started with the Ubuntu Enterprise
Cloud (UEC). The easiest way to get started with UEC is to do a fresh
installation of Ubuntu 9.10 Server with the UEC option. You need two
systems at a minimum to build your first cloud. One will be the cloud
controller (the master node that dispatches and monitors the instances
of the virtual machines), and the other will be the node controller
(where all the instances actually will run). Minimum configurations are
listed in the installation documentation (see Resources),
but I recommend a dual-core, 2GHz machine with 2GB of RAM and a 100GB
disk as a realistic usable minimum for each. Note that you will
need Virtualization Extensions (VT) enabled on the node controller
machine. Eucalyptus requires that. Your systems can be either 32-bit or
64-bit (mine are both 64-bit), but be advised that although the 64-bit host
can run a 32-bit instance, the opposite is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> true.
</p><p>
First, let's install the cloud controller.
To start the
install, boot your machine off an Ubuntu 9.10 Server CD, select
Install Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud at the boot menu, and then press Enter. That
starts the standard text-based install, with a twist: along the way,
you'll be asked what type of cloud installation mode you want&mdash;a
&ldquo;Cluster&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Node&rdquo;. Because you're installing the
cloud controller first,
select Cluster and press Enter. The installer will proceed normally,
but it will ask you two more questions unique to the Ubuntu Enterprise
Cloud installation: the name of your cluster (this is just a unique
identifier like &ldquo;testcluster&rdquo;) and a range of IP addresses on your LAN
that the cloud controller can allocate to instances. Once you've done
that, the installer will finish out much like a regular Ubuntu text-based
install, and your machine will reboot. That's it! Your cloud controller
is now on-line.
</p><p>
Next, you need to install a node controller. This is even easier. Boot
the computer that will become the node controller from the same Ubuntu
9.10 Server CD, select Install Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud from the boot
menu, and the installer should detect the cluster automatically and
select Node within the installer. Simply press Enter to confirm you
want to install a node and confirm your system's partitioning scheme,
and the rest of the installation is completed for you. The installer
even copies your login account over from the cloud controller.
</p><p>
Now that your nodes are up, you need to register the node controller
with the cloud controller. Log in to the cloud controller, and run the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo euca_conf --no-rsync --discover-nodes
</pre>
</p><p>
The cloud
controller will auto-discover the nodes that are running the node
controller service, and it will prompt you to register each by its
IP address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1f580.0x1e178d8"></a>
Obtaining Access</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can use the cloud, you've got to register yourself with
it and obtain credentials. Fire up a Web browser (either on the
cloud controller or on another machine on the LAN), and go to this URL:
https://&lt;cloud-controller-ip-address&gt;:8443. You have to use a secure
connection, and you'll get a security certificate warning from your
browser. Once you accept the cert warning, use the user name
&ldquo;admin&rdquo;
and password &ldquo;admin&rdquo; to log in to the page (Figure 1). Then, you'll be prompted to
change the admin password and fill in your e-mail address, so the
UEC can mail you information about your instances.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10626f1.large.jpg"><img src="10626f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Login Page
</p></div></div><p>
Next, you need to get your credentials to a location where you can use
them. I prefer to do this on the cloud controller, so run this script
as your regular user on the cloud controller:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p ~/.euca
chmod 700 ~/.euca
cd ~/.euca
sudo euca_conf --get-credentials mycreds.zip
unzip mycreds.zip
cd -
</pre>
</p><p>
This drops your credentials for the UEC into the ~/.euca
directory. The credentials can be downloaded from the UEC admin portal to
another Ubuntu machine for use if you so desire. Next, you need to add the
line <tt  >. ~/.euca/eucarc</tt> to your shell's profile (~/.bashrc on an Ubuntu
machine or the cloud controller) to source the eucarc file every time
your shell starts. If you're on another machine aside from the cloud
controller, you need to install the euca2ools package as well.
</p><p>
Now that the prep work is done, you can verify that the cluster
is working properly by running the <tt  >euca-describe-availability-zones
verbose</tt> command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@falcon:~$ euca-describe-availability-zones verbose
AVAILABILITYZONE     cluster1        192.168.1.116
AVAILABILITYZONE     |- vm types     free / max   cpu   ram  disk
AVAILABILITYZONE     |- m1.small     0002 / 0002   1    128     2
AVAILABILITYZONE     |- c1.medium    0002 / 0002   1    256     5
AVAILABILITYZONE     |- m1.large     0001 / 0001   2    512    10
AVAILABILITYZONE     |- m1.xlarge    0001 / 0001   2   1024    20
AVAILABILITYZONE     |- c1.xlarge    0000 / 0000   4   2048    20
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1f580.0x1e17f08"></a>
Installing Images on Your UEC</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's possible to make your own custom images to run on your cloud
(see Resources for a link on bundling images), it's far easier
to get one from the UEC &ldquo;store&rdquo; (Figure 2). Simply access the cloud controller at
the URL https://&lt;cloud-controller-ip-address&gt;:8443/, enter your login
and password, click the Store tab, and you'll be presented with the
UEC Store. Just find an image you'd like to install (at the time of this
writing, there are only three), and push the Install button. Your image will download
and install to your cluster automagically. Once that's done, you'll get a
How to Run? link under the grayed-out Install button. If you click
that link, you'll get the exact command line that will instantiate,
or start, your selected image.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10626f2.large.jpg"><img src="10626f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d1f580.0x1e18220"></a>
Starting Your Image</h2></div></div><p>
Instantiating an image requires you to use the command line on the cloud
controller (or wherever you installed your credentials). Before you run
your first image, you've got to create an SSH keypair so you can log in to
your instance as root once it's up and running. The key is stored and
is common across all your instances, so this script needs to be
run only once:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ! -e ~/.euca/mykey.priv ]; then
    touch ~/.euca/mykey.priv
    chmod 0600 ~/.euca/mykey.priv
    euca-add-keypair mykey &gt; ~/.euca/mykey.priv
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, configure the cloud to allow port 22 access (SSH)
inbound for all instances. The following command will allow SSH from any
source IP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
euca-authorize default -P tcp -p 22 -s 0.0.0.0/0
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can fire up your first image:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@falcon:~$ euca-run-instances emi-DF841070 -k mykey -t c1.medium
RESERVATION     r-3409079E      admin   admin-default
INSTANCE        i-46780864      emi-DF841070
                                    0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  pending mykey
                                    2009-12-10T06:26:09.471Z
                                    eki-F59010E3  eri-0A2A115C
</pre>
</p><p>
The first time you instantiate a particular image, it'll be slow
to start. Eucalyptus caches the image on the node controller, so
there's a sizable amount of data that's got to move to the node. You
can keep tabs on the status of your image by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
watch -n5 euca-describe-instances
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll see two IP addresses listed in the output
of the <tt  >euca-describe-instances</tt> command. One will be an IP on your LAN, and
the other will be a private IP. Once the instance is listed as
&ldquo;running&rdquo;,
you can <tt  >ssh</tt> to it on the IP listed in the output. Note that it doesn't
have a user account with a password on it, so you need to use the
SSH key created earlier:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bill@falcon:~$ euca-describe-instances
RESERVATION     r-3409079E      admin   default
INSTANCE        i-46780864      emi-DF841070
                                    192.168.1.170  172.19.1.2
                                    running  mykey  0  c1.medium
                                    2009-12-10T06:26:09.471Z
                                    cluster1
                                    eki-F59010E3  eri-0A2A115C
bill@falcon:~$
bill@falcon:~$ ssh -i ~/.euca/mykey.priv ubuntu@192.168.1.170

At this point, you're in your instance, and it's a fully functioning
system. You can <tt  >apt-get</tt> packages like apache or do
further system configuration
if you want. When you're done, you can exit your SSH
session, and then terminate the instance by finding the instance
ID from the output of the <tt  >euca-describe-instances</tt> command (in the
example above, it's i-46780864) and running <tt  >euca-terminate-instances
&lt;instanceID&gt;</tt>. Your instance will then shut down.
</p><p>
This article barely scratches the surface of what's possible
with the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud. Although it's less flexible than
other virtualization technologies like VMware or VirtualBox, it is
API-compatible with Amazon's EC2 service, and it allows you to build
networks of virtual machines far beyond what's possible with conventional
virtualization solutions. If you require a scalable network of virtual
systems that can be instantiated and terminated dynamically, the
Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud and Eucalyptus are for you.

Virtualization Extensions&mdash;Make Sure They're Enabled!</b></p><p>
Eucalyptus requires that the CPU on the node controllers have
Virtualization Extensions (VT) enabled. Do yourself a favor and go
into your BIOS and check that it is enabled. Simply grepping for
&ldquo;vmx&rdquo;
in /proc/cpuinfo isn't enough. The BIOS support must be enabled as
well. When preparing to write this article, I burned up several days
in testing to learn this fact. The virtual machine appeared to start,
then terminated immediately with an obscure message in the nc.log file
on the node controller like <tt  >[EUCAERROR ] libvirt: Domain not found: no
domain with matching name 'i-427C0881' (code=42)</tt>. Simply flipping the
BIOS switch that enabled Virtualization Extensions allowed the virtual
machine to start properly. Verify your BIOS settings before installation!

What's the Walrus&mdash;CooCooCaChoo?</b></p><p>
Eucalyptus includes a service known as the walrus. The walrus service is
a storage service that emulates Amazon's S3 storage. This article covers
the default installation of Eucalyptus that runs the walrus
service on the same system as the cloud controller. If you have a server
with a lot of disk space, it's entirely possible to split the walrus
service out and export hunks of disk space as volumes to the virtual
machines. In other words, it's a free implementation of a virtual SAN
for your virtual machines. Unfortunately, getting into the specifics of
the walrus goes beyond what can be covered here.

DHCP Issues</b></p><p>
The Eucalyptus cloud controller does run a DHCP server that will respond
to requests from cloud instances. However, if you have a DHCP server
on your LAN, it may be possible that your instances could receive a DHCP
address from your other DHCP server rather than the cloud controller's DHCP server.
You may want to tell your main DHCP server to ignore requests sent from the MAC addresses of
the cloud instances. All of the cloud instances have MAC addresses that
begin in d0:0d. On my DHCP server running dnsmasq, all I had to do was
add a line to the dnsmasq.conf file that said
<tt  >dhcp-host=d0:0d:*,ignore</tt>.
