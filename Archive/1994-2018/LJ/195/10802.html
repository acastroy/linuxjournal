This month, we focus on Linux in the enterprise. No, not that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise</em></span>
(I'm pretty sure I used the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> joke last year). We're talking about
large deployments of Linux. One awesome thing about such an issue focus is
that it really doesn't apply only to folks administering huge networks.
Most of the features scale down quite nicely for those of us administering
a closet in our bedroom, a server rack in the basement or just a database
on the couch. In fact, Reuven M. Lerner talks about CouchDB this month.
Silly name aside, CouchDB is becoming more and more popular as a
non-relational database. If you like what Canonical is doing with its
syncing technology in Ubuntu One, you'll want to check out the underlying
framework it uses&mdash;first and foremost, CouchDB.

Bill Childers has his head up in the clouds again, and this time he
shows us how to set up our own cloud with Eucalyptus. Sure Amazon and
that ilk are great if you don't have your own servers, but if you already
own the hardware, why not make your own cloud? Bill shows how. If
you already have your servers set up, perhaps you're just at the point when you
need to administer them, whether they're in the cloud or not. Kyle Rankin,
an enterprise sysadmin himself, presents a few more tricks of the trade
with a series of crafty ways to use SSH.
</p><p>
Perhaps you're not interested in setting up a cloud, and you just want to
make your existing servers (or cloud) do something useful. We have plenty
of that this month too. Dave Taylor continues his series on scripting HTML
forms, Michael Nugent talks about MySQL replication, and Daniel Bartholomew
discusses SQL vs. NoSQL (where we get to watch Daniel battle his own version
of Point/Counterpoint). Regardless of what services you offer on your
servers, you need to be able to monitor them. Also in this issue, Paul Tader shows
us Zabbix, a cross-platform monitoring tool that takes much of the sting
out of setting up monitoring.
</p><p>
For some of us, Linux in the enterprise is only a dream we'd like to see
come to fruition. We labor over our Linux machines at home, yet at
work, we're stuck with proprietary operating systems and closed-source
programs. Jeramiah Bowling compares Microsoft
Windows and Linux in the enterprise, pulling the rug out from under
some common misconceptions and providing some real data we might use to
demonstrate where Linux might be a better fit. Unfortunately, even if the
logic is clear, sometimes politics are a bigger stumbling block than
feasibility. Avi Deitcher writes about the whole process of introducing
open-source software and ideals to business folks. It's often a difficult
undertaking, and Avi has some smart tips.
</p><p>
What if enterprise Linux doesn't interest you at all? Don't worry; we
understand. And, even if you work on Linux in the enterprise, sometimes it's
nice to come home and enjoy your own Linux machines without worrying about
clouds, monitoring, scalability and other 9-to-5-sounding words.
Jono Bacon introduces us to Quickly this month. Quickly is a program that
supplies templates, tools and a framework to allow quick desktop
application development. If you've ever wanted to make your own applications,
but didn't want to go through the frustration of the traditional
development model, Quickly might be right up your alley.
</p><p>
We also
have a review of the Coyote Point Application Balancer, 
Dirk Elmendorf covers desktop document scanning, and John Knight introduces
some fresh projects. Plus, there are all the other articles that make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> such a
fun magazine for geeks. So whether you're building your own cloud,
tweaking your existing infrastructure or just killing time on the command
line, this issue has you covered.
