We've been digging into the Yahoo Movies database for the past few
months, as you'll recall, building a command called findmovie
that will have the following usage: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
USAGE: findmovie -g genre -k keywords -nrst title
</pre>
</p><p>
However, we slammed into a wall at 100kph last month in the
simplest of calculations: how many titles match a given combination of
query elements?
</p><p>
For example, how many action films are there that have &ldquo;death&rdquo; in
the title? That'd look like <tt  >findmovie -g act death</tt>,
but making that count actually work is tricky, because the Yahoo Movies database
output is different depending on whether there are zero matches, less
than a page of matches or more than a page of matches.
Examples of each output are
&ldquo;Sorry, no matches were found&rdquo;, 
&ldquo;(All results shown)&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;&lt; Prev | 1 - 20 of 143 | Next 20 &gt;&rdquo;, respectively.
</p><p>
Oh, and it gets worse. Sometimes when there's less than a full page
of results, you'll see something like this: &ldquo;&lt; Prev | 1 - 3 of 3 |
Next &gt;&rdquo; instead.
</p><p>
It's pretty much a huge pain in the booty, and even if you crack open
the source, there's no handy spot that says &ldquo;0&rdquo; or
&ldquo;4&rdquo; or
&ldquo;143&rdquo;. So, that's what I want to focus on this month&mdash;parsing an
HTML file to isolate and identify this particular data point.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea2580.0xf9aa90"></a>
Caching the Results</h2></div></div><p>
The first observation I have about identifying a solution is that we are
going to need to cache (or save) the results, so we can parse it more
than once to see what we find. This brings up the old shell scripting
challenge of choosing a good, unique, temporary filename.
</p><p>
I'm old-school. I'm used to using <tt  >.$$</tt> to use the process ID
as the basis of the temp file, but in fact, there are better solutions in
modern Linux systems. Check out mktemp if you're on a BSD-based
system. If that's not available, use man smartly: <tt  >man -k temp |
grep '(1'</tt> will extract the replacement that your distro has instead.
Here's a typical use of mktemp:

<pre     class="programlisting">
appname=$(basename $0)
TMPFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/${appname}.XXXXXX) || exit 1 
</pre>
</p><p>
It looks pretty similar, but by using that many X characters, the program
uses the PID and random letters, making the temp file impossible for a
hacker to guess or anticipate. The version of this script I've been
developing on my Mac OS X system had the following code snippet: 


<pre     class="programlisting">

if [ $dump -eq 1 ] ; then
  exec /usr/bin/curl --silent "$baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern"
else
  exec open -a safari "$baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern"
fi 

</pre>
</p><p>
The problem here is that using <tt  >exec</tt> to invoke a command replaces
the shell script with the command in question, which isn't going to
work. Instead, it's time to rewrite it:


<pre     class="programlisting">

if [ $dump -eq 1 ] ; then
   appname=$(basename $0)
   TMPFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/${appname}.XXXXXX) || exit 1
  /usr/bin/curl --silent "$baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern" \
     &gt; $TMPFILE
else
  exec open -a safari "$baseurl${params}\&amp;p=$pattern"
fi 

</pre>
</p><p>
That looks good. If we're dumping the file source, it'll go to the
temporary file for later analysis. If it's a request that is supposed
to launch the search results in a browser, it still uses the Mac OS X
open command. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea2580.0xf9b010"></a>
Parsing the Results</h2></div></div><p>
To figure out what's going on,
we need to account for three different possibilities, each of which has a
different &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; in the source file. Here's a rough template:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ! -z "$(grep -i "no matches were found" $TMPFILE)" ]
then
  echo there are zero results for that search.
elif [ ! -z "$(grep -i "Next&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;" $TMPFILE)" ]
then
  echo got some results with case two.
else
  echo more than a page of results
fi 
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, I'm showing only output echo statements to give you a sense of the
algorithm, but you can see that we're just testing for a known string
that hopefully won't show up in other situations. Note the third test,
though: <tt  >Next&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;</tt> is some HTML
weirdness. &ldquo;nbsp&rdquo; is a
non-breaking space, and &ldquo;gt&rdquo; is the &gt; symbol. Wrap 'em in
&ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; and &ldquo;;&rdquo;, and you have HTML character
entities.
</p><p>
To ascertain the total match count requires yet more parsing of the
output. Search for &ldquo;death race&rdquo;, and you'll find three matches,
which end up looking like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; 

</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, it's rather buried in a more complicated pattern, because
here's a typical match: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;td align=right&gt;&lt;font face=arial size="-2"&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;
&#8618;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;Prev&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;1 - 3&lt;/b&gt;
&#8618;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;... 
</pre>
</p><p>
I have to admit, I was stumped for a bit, which is why having geeky
friends like Martin and Lucretia M. Pruitt is so darn helpful. I posed
this puzzle on Twitter (I'm @DaveTaylor if you want to follow me), and
after some false starts, they suggested a simple and logical solution:
turn the &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; into individual character delimiters,
then simply use cut to pull out the field we seek. Smart!
</p><p>
Here's how that looks as a simple command sequence: 

<pre     class="programlisting">

grep -i "1 - " $TMPFILE |
   sed 's/&lt;b&gt;/~/g;s/&lt;\/b&gt;/~/g' |
   cut -d\~ -f4 

</pre>
</p><p>
Armed with this, the ugly HTML sequence above quickly reduces down to
the value 3, which is exactly what we want. One nuance, though. It turns
out that this data appears both before and after the matches, so we
need to slip <tt  >| head -1</tt> to ensure that we're parsing
only one
line and not duplicating the data entry or confusing the new parser.
This means we can create the following code:


<pre     class="programlisting">

if [ ! -z "$(grep -i "no matches were found" $TMPFILE)" ]
then
  matches=0
elif [ ! -z "$(grep -i "Next&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;" $TMPFILE)" ]
then
  matches="$(grep -i "1 - " $TMPFILE | head -1 | \
     sed 's/&lt;b&gt;/~/g;s/&lt;\/b&gt;/~/g' | cut -d\~ -f4)"
else
  matches="$(grep -i "1 - " $TMPFILE | head -1 | \
     sed 's/&lt;b&gt;/~/g;s/&lt;\/b&gt;/~/g' | cut -d\~ -f4)"
fi 

</pre>
</p><p>
You can see how I'm differentiating the three cases and how the
resultant code is fairly similar in the second and third cases. In fact,
they don't need to be separate cases, so the count is more easily
calculated like this: 


<pre     class="programlisting">

if [ ! -z "$(grep -i "no matches were found" $TMPFILE)" ]
then
  matches=0
else
  matches="$(grep -i "1 - " $TMPFILE | head -1 | \
     sed 's/&lt;b&gt;/~/g;s/&lt;\/b&gt;/~/g' | cut -d\~ -f4)"
fi 

</pre>
</p><p>
If you initialized <tt  >matches</tt> to zero, you actually can flip the
logic of the first conditional and prune it down even further:


<pre     class="programlisting">

matches=0 
if [ -z "$(grep -i "no matches were found" $TMPFILE)" ]
then
  matches="$(grep -i "1 - " $TMPFILE | head -1 | \
     sed 's/&lt;b&gt;/~/g;s/&lt;\/b&gt;/~/g' | cut -d\~ -f4)"
fi 

</pre>
</p><p>
Nice. It's a simple, straightforward and fine example of how if you
keep thinking about what you're really accomplishing with complex
conditionals, they often can be not only simplified, but sped up too.

Next Month</h2></div></div><p>
While writing these columns on working with Yahoo Movies, I've found my
interest has been pulled in a different direction: a &ldquo;name that
tune&rdquo;
game. That's what we'll start working on next month. If you want to
get a sneak peek at it and see how it evolves in real time (rather than
here in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>), jump on Twitter and follow @SongTitle.
It's going to be fun!
