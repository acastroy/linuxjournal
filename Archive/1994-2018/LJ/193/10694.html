Using Linux and a few extra parts, the Linux Laptop Orchestra
from Virginia Tech is music to our ears, in more ways than one.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17d5300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When I searched Google for &ldquo;define: orchestra&rdquo;, I received some interesting
responses. The first definition I found says &ldquo;a musical organization consisting of
a group of instrumentalists including string players&rdquo;, which describes
a rock band as well as the Boston Pops. Another defines
an orchestra as &ldquo;an instrumental ensemble, usually fairly large with
string, brass, woodwind sections and possibly a percussion section as
well&rdquo;. That one is closer to the popular conception of an orchestra,
but my favorite definition is &ldquo;a group of musicians led by the conductor
who accompany the singers&rdquo;, a clarification sure to ruffle the feathers
of many an orchestral instrumentalist.
</p><p>
The definition of a laptop orchestra requires similar flexibility. Modern
computers make excellent music machines, whether for common media
playback or for the specialized purposes of music composition and audio
synthesis. Even inexpensive laptops, notebooks and Netbooks are capable
of high-quality real-time synthesis, giving them an apparently limitless
variety of sounds. The machine is well described as a meta-instrument,
an instrument that subsumes the sound palette of traditional instruments
and adds new sonic possibilities of its own. An ensemble of such machines
might be described as a meta-orchestra, an orchestra of orchestras
or simply a laptop orchestra.
</p><p>
In this article, I combine a project profile, an interview with the team
leader and some musings on the significance of the world's first Linux
Laptop Orchestra, aka L2Ork (pronounced &ldquo;lork&rdquo;). The L2Ork is not the
first group of its kind, but it is the first such group based on Linux
system and application software. The laptop orchestra has arrived.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17d5778"></a>
History</h2></div></div><p>
Today's laptop performance groups have evolved from aesthetic concepts
and performance practices that date from the early days of the personal
computer. In the late 1970s, musicians and hackers around San Francisco
formed the League Of Automatic Music Composers. The League's many
fascinating projects included one of the first &ldquo;network bands&rdquo; based on
the newly available KIM-1 microcomputer. Eventually, the League disbanded,
but members John Bischoff and Tim Perkis formed another network band to
perform what they called Hub music. The Hub's performances were successful
enough to keep the performing group active for ten years.
</p><p>
In 1985, the arrival of MIDI revolutionized the entire music world. For
the first time, music could be composed, performed and recorded with an
inexpensive single computer, without the need for instrumentalists and at
comparatively little expense. Unfortunately, MIDI has certain drawbacks
for networked ensembles, including a relatively slow transmission rate
bound to a serial data flow. Nevertheless, ensembles of computers running
MIDI software could network within the limitations of the specification,
and even The Hub experimented with MIDI connectivity.
</p><p>
By the late 1990s, desktop computers were powerful enough to perform
real-time audio synthesis while simultaneously processing MIDI data. At
the start of the 21st century, the same measure of raw power could be
found in lightweight low-cost portable machines, and the development of
OSC (Open Sound Control) removed some of the restrictions imposed
by MIDI. Among its virtues, OSC accommodates a much wider variety
of data types and requires only common networking hardware, such as
Ethernet cabling and connectors, giving it a natural fit to designs for
computer-based orchestras.
</p><p>
The OLPC (One Laptop Per Child) Project deserves mention in this
context. A wireless LAN of OLPC laptops can be bound to one machine's
clock for synchronizing the group, giving any group of OLPC machines
the capabilities of a laptop orchestra. However, those capabilities are
restricted by the relatively low power of the machine itself.
</p><p>
In spring 2008, the prestigious <span   class="emphasis"><em>Computer Music Journal</em></span> published
two papers describing the activities of a laptop orchestra led by Ge Wang
and Perry Cook at Princeton University. The descriptions and analyses
of the Princeton Laptop Orchestra (aka PLOrk) provided the starting
points for subsequent laptop-based orchestras, such as the Stanford Laptop
Orchestra (SLOrk), and eventually found their way into the able hands and
mind of Ivica Ico Bukvic, a professor of music at Virginia Tech and the
founder and current director of the Linux Laptop Orchestra there.
</p><p>
The Princeton Laptop Orchestra defined the form and basic potential
of the laptop ensemble, but it relied upon the combination of a
powerful open-source programming language (Ge Wang's ChucK) with a
powerful closed-source application (Cycling 74's Max/MSP) running
on proprietary hardware (Apple PowerBooks and MacBooks). Alas, those
closed and proprietary aspects can drive the costs of such an ensemble
beyond the budgets of many music departments and other interested
organizations. Fortunately, the next logical step was taken by the Linux
laptop orchestra. Max/MSP can be replaced by Pd and other free software,
the restriction of vendor-specific hardware can be removed by the use
of inexpensive commodity machines and input devices, and even the cost
of the speaker arrays can be reduced significantly. During our interview,
L2Ork leader Ico Bukvic stated that the current cost per seat was about
$750 and that the cost included the computer and the speaker system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17d5ae8"></a>
And Then There Was L2Ork</h2></div></div><p>
The success of the Princeton and Stanford groups inspired Ico Bukvic to
form a similar group at Virginia Tech. However, his vision of the laptop
orchestra would take the franchise into a new direction. Ico wisely
adopted the Princeton group's general design and organization, but his
Linux background compelled him to improve the ensemble's affordability
and accessibility.
</p><p>
By 2007, Ico had founded the Digital Interactive Sound and Intermedia
Studio (DISIS) at Virginia Tech with the intention of &ldquo;fostering
cutting-edge research as well as innovative approaches to interactive
multimedia art genre&rdquo;, to quote from the DISIS Web site. With such an
infrastructure in place, Ico concluded that DISIS would be a natural fit
for the world's first Linux-based laptop orchestra.
</p><p>
Early in 2009, Ico received an internal grant from the Institute for
Society, Culture and Environment at Virginia Tech, in collaboration
with his colleague Dr Tom Martin, Associate Professor of Electrical
and Computer Engineering. By the spring, the project had acquired greater
support from Virginia Tech as well as from external sponsors that include
the Sweetwater company, MSI Computer and the Roland Corporation. At that
time, the DISIS developed its own design for a hemispherical speaker and
began assembling the various other hardware and software components needed
for the debut of the Linux Laptop Orchestra in the fall&mdash;all told, a fair
amount of achievement for a year's work. Since then, the group has expanded
to include Dr Eric Standley (Professor of Art) and seven undergraduates.
</p><p>
In December 2009, the Linux Laptop Orchestra made its official world debut
in the Squires Studio Theater at Virginia Tech (Figure 1). According
to eye-and-ear witnesses, the house was jammed, and the performance was a
great success. Critical coverage was positive, and the event even made
it to the hallowed pages of Slashdot. Clearly, fame had come to the L2Ork.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10694f1.large.jpg"><img src="10694f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. L2Ork Debut Performance
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17d5f08"></a>
The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a closer look at L2Ork's physical plant. The orchestra is
currently configured for up to 15 players. Each player operates a
basic system that includes an MSI Wind Netbook (Figure 2) with a Cakewalk
UA-1G USB audio interface, Nintendo Wiimote and Nunchuk controllers,
and a custom &ldquo;hemipod&rdquo; speaker array. The hemipods are connected to
three shared subwoofer systems.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10694f2.large.jpg"><img src="10694f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MSI Wind Netbook with Custom Software
</p></div></div><p>
The L2Ork FAQ page notes that the decision to employ the Nintendo
controllers resulted from a need to replace the Apple machines. The
Princeton group exploits accelerometer hardware built in to the MacBook
and PowerBook, but the Wiimote and Nunchuk controllers have proven to be a
happy choice. They are well supported by Linux, are sufficiently
sensitive for deployment as musical controllers, and their gestural
geometry includes a Z-axis. Also, everyone has fun playing with them.
</p><p>
The integrated audio hardware on most laptops is insufficiently powerful
for the typical needs of a desktop audio production system, much less for
the needs of a member of a laptop orchestra. The L2Ork's Wind Netbooks are
connected to the UA-1G, a USB audio interface with stereo I/O supporting
sample rates up to 96kHz and bit depth to 24 bits. The unit includes
decent analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters and provides
RCA and optical connections for S/PDIF digital I/O. I was surprised to
learn that MIDI is not a feature of the UA-1G, and I suspect that at
some future time, the L2Ork crew will want to add MIDI connectivity to
their network arsenal.
</p><p>
As you can see in Figure 3, the hemipods are definitely eye-catchers. An
amplifier and six speakers are mounted within a hemisphere enclosure for
a radiant 6-channel sound dispersal (Figure 4). Each seat in the group
has its own pod, and each pod is controlled by its single user. The pods
are potentially the most expensive component to the orchestra, but the
L2Ork group has published complete directions for users who want to cut
costs by building their own arrays.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17d6698"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
L2Ork's Netbooks run a mixture of off-the-shelf free software and
some custom control programs (also free) written especially for the
orchestra. Where the Princeton group deployed the Max/MSP software, the
L2Ork group uses its free-software doppelganger, Miller Puckette's Pure
Data, more affectionately known as Pd. Both Max/MSP and Pd present a
graphic interface to their myriad functions, which include numerous
synthesis and audio processing routines. Pd is powerful, easy to learn
and extensible by its users. This last aspect is of particular importance
when designing interfaces usable by performers who may not be literate in
either Pd or Linux itself. Pd accommodates a wide variety of I/O devices
(such as the Nintendo controllers), includes functions to provide easy
access to network connectivity, and supports OSC and MIDI. A further
list of Pd's capabilities is beyond the scope of this article, but it
must be said that Pd is a &ldquo;perfect fit&rdquo; for the laptop orchestra on a
budget. The suggested retail price for the closed-source proprietary
Max/MSP is a cool $495, while the total cost of Pd is $0.
</p><p>
Pd's integrated graphic components aren't bad (Figure 5), but they are
less than shiny, especially when compared with the program's commercial
counterpart. However, thanks to Pd's extensibility, the L2Ork group gets
to look at some more sophisticated custom GUI components.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10694f5.large.jpg"><img src="10694f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A Pd Patch for Audio Synthesis
</p></div></div><p>
Ico Bukvic is no stranger to programming a useful and attractive
GUI. While watching the L2Ork performance videos, I thought I recognized a
variant of RTmix, a program he wrote when he taught at the University of
Cincinnati. RTmix provides visual and audio cues for performers working
with computers. It also can schedule other computer-generated activities
and events&mdash;a handy tool indeed for the laptop ensemble.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17d6ab8"></a>
Playing in the Band</h2></div></div><p>
I was curious to know what academic disciplines were represented within
the group of players. I could assume the presence of at least some
musicians, and I expected a few comp-sci types, but I was surprised to
learn that in fall 2009 the group consisted of one music major,
three majors in music technology and one representative each from
biology, theater arts, engineering and political science.
</p><p>
Players without performance backgrounds may be reluctant to &ldquo;let
go&rdquo;
as they learn how to manipulate sound with the Nintendo controllers. As
they progress, they lose their self-consciousness and begin to realize that
they are exploring new performance techniques. Enthusiasm takes hold as
the players learn how to create predictable (and unpredictable) effects
by moving the controllers in defined arcs and to definite points in the
gestural space. Given the early stage of the modern laptop orchestra, a
standard repertoire of performance techniques is still being researched
and cataloged. However, it is a goal of rehearsals to ensure that each
member of the group is aware that his or her movements have specific
outcomes for the piece being played. In the same manner as a traditional
instrumentalist, the L2Orkists learn how to play their instruments with
the control of a rehearsed technique. In other words, they're not just
waving their arms around. Well, actually they are waving their arms
around, but every movement is defined and directed. And, that brings us
to the role of the conductor.
</p><p>
In a traditional orchestra, the players are led through the score of the
music by the conductor. To the untrained eye, conductors may seem to be
doing little more than waving their arms around. In fact, conductors are
responsible for many musical functions. They need to know the score
in intimate detail, to know its parts for every member in the instrumental
groups, and have a working knowledge of each instrument and the ability to
instruct players in terms specific to their instruments. Conductors are
human mixers, the one component of a group who plays no instrument yet
commands them all. Conductors are responsible for timbral and amplitude
balances, and the interpretation of an entire work is performed according
to their conception of how the piece should sound. Every artist has
a unique personal interpretive sensibility; thus, we have a multitude
of recorded versions of Beethoven's symphonies.
</p><p>
In the laptop orchestra, the conductor's role subsumes traditional
functions and adds new possibilities. With the appropriate software, the
computers in the ensemble are perfectly capable of performing without
a conductor. In point of fact, they can do without the performer too,
but that scenario is not of interest at the moment. As you can see in the
videos, the L2Ork behaves like a traditional orchestra&mdash;that is, the performers
play their instruments under the guidance of the conductor. However,
other scenarios easily present themselves, and those other possibilities
may be of compelling interest to a composer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17cd5b0"></a>
The Composer's Corner</h2></div></div><p>
See the Resources for this article for some links to music
performed by various laptop orchestras. It doesn't take long to realize
that just about any style of music can be written for and performed by a
laptop group, although Ico advised me that if the composer wants a screaming
lead-guitar solo over a manic heavy-metal bass and drum pattern, that
composer would be better off with a rock band than a laptop orchestra. Yes,
a laptop ensemble is extremely flexible, but composers still
must consider whether it is the appropriate vehicle for their music.
</p><p>
Ico Bukvic's &ldquo;Citadel&rdquo; is an excellent example of a piece written
specifically for the L2Ork group. It is a beautiful work, and while
listening to it, I wondered if it could be played by a traditional
group. I concluded that it could be arranged for such a group but that
it probably would lose something in the translation. By comparison
with some other compositions for laptop groups, Ico's piece is a
relatively conservative work, one that was likely intended to give his
players a gentle introduction to a piece written in a modern musical
idiom. Other recordings show off the less traditional, more experimental
possibilities. Of course, it is unnecessary to choose between extremes,
and composers for the laptop orchestra have access to a vast palette
of sounds and performance techniques that they can bend, fold, staple
and mutilate to their hearts' content.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17cd768"></a>
The Author Muses</h2></div></div><p>
The computer can be used to create new sounds from synthesis primitives
(oscillators, envelopes and filters), from recordings of existing sounds
(sampling, analysis/resynthesis and granulation) or from mathematical
models of the physical characteristics of sounding materials (physical
modeling). It can follow a set of instructions that tell it when to do
these things, and with the appropriate control software, the machine can
decide for itself where, when and what to play during a performance. But,
exactly how does someone &ldquo;play&rdquo; a computer? The generality of the machine
works in favor of multiple solutions to the problem of the performer's
interface. The common input devices&mdash;keyboard, mouse, joystick,
touchpad, tablet, touchscreen&mdash;can be used, although typically, they have
no tactile sensitivity. MIDI-based solutions include keyboards, guitars,
percussion pads and wind controllers, all of which have the advantage
of being familiar designs for musicians trained to play traditional
instruments. The USB port provides connectivity with pressure-sensitive
devices and other sensors whose data streams can be mapped to synthesis
parameters and score events. Composers can specify any or all of
these devices as needed, or they may design a completely new interface.
</p><p>
Given the protean nature of the instrument and its networking
capabilities, computer-based ensembles can take on many forms. The
machine can be programmed to function musically as a single instrument or
an ensemble of instruments, as a standalone performer or as a member
of an ensemble, with or without an operator. These distinctions are not
exclusive&mdash;a soloist may be accompanied by an ensemble in a concerto-like
piece&mdash;and the composition of a group is subject to fluid redefinition
over a network. Unlike an instrument in a traditional orchestra, the
machine needn't have a single permanent identity.
</p><p>
A human instrumentalist performs many related tasks when reading a score
or improvising. Ensemble players learn to master their individual parts
by attending to technical issues and by responding musically to the
dictates of the score. Within the group, there is a further exercise of
sensitivities. Each player becomes responsible for the balance of his
or her part within the group, and everyone's performance is understood
to serve a particular interpretation. Modeling the complexity of the
musical and social group dynamics of a performing ensemble presents
formidable difficulties, particularly when we want the machine to
interact with a musically convincing improvised response to another
player's improvisation while following and interpreting the guidance of
a conductor (human or otherwise).
</p><p>
Frankly, the musical mind boggles at the possibilities presented by the
laptop orchestra. Ico and I joked about creating a game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Orchestra
Hero</em></span> for the group, but why not? In the domain of education, the possible
applications of the laptop orchestra could be most attractive, especially
as costs rise and budgets shrink. I have no desire to see traditional
instruments replaced by computers, but I'd love to see the computer
become even more integrated into school music programs at all levels.

The Future Beckons</h2></div></div><p>
I hope you've enjoyed this introduction to the Linux Laptop Orchestra. Of
course, you really need to watch and listen to the group in concert, so be
sure to check out the videos and other recordings. Check out the whole
*Ork scene while you're at it&mdash;you'll be watching the cutting edge in
action. If you are sufficiently inspired, you even can put together your
own Linux laptop orchestra. The plans are freely available, the costs
are low, and the software solutions are free and open source. All that's
needed is a little do-it-yourself spirit, a little hardware hacking
and Linux on the inside.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16dd580.0x17cdb88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
An Interview with Ivica Ico Bukvic</b></p><p>
I spoke with Ico Bukvic on the hard-line and later asked him for a question-and-answer session to clarify some of the points we discussed. I must note
that we had a hard time finishing our chats, the subject matter is simply
too exciting and provocative.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Are the Netbooks networked with each other or are they standalone units?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> Networking is a critical component of the ensemble, as this is something
truly unique to the laptop orchestra genre. Hence, all machines are
networked at all times, allowing composers to take advantage of this great
opportunity to build monitoring tools, coordinate the ensemble and even
alter the ensemble's properties in real time, based on performers' actions.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> What Linux distribution are you using?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> Currently, we are using a modified version of Ubuntu 9.04 and have just
begun migrating slowly to 9.10 with the ultimate short-term goal of
eventually moving to the 10.04 LTS release.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Are you exploiting the capabilities of the real-time kernel,
low latency and JACK?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> Absolutely! Our current 9.04 setup runs the 2.26.29-rc6-rt3 real-time
kernel, which we compiled in-house. With our upcoming migration to 9.10,
we've been testing the one provided by Ubuntu Studio and have been quite
pleased by its performance in our tests so far.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Besides Pd, what other application software is used?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> Currently, all works written specifically for L2Ork rely upon Pd or
our customized version of Pd-extended. As things settle a bit, we are
definitely looking forward to incorporating ChucK and SuperCollider, which
will enable us also to perform works written for other *Orks, and
other DSP software composers may end up utilizing works written
specifically for our ensemble.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Is being a musician or programmer helpful/necessary/preferable/required
for members of the band?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> While having musical background, performance experience, and being
proficient with technology certainly helps, this in my opinion is only a
fraction of the overall L2Ork experience. If anything, I would argue that
L2Ork offers a uniquely level playing field, engaging students regardless
of their background and/or current area of study. Perhaps this is
one of its greatest creative strengths.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Has L2Ork performed music written for other laptop ensembles?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> Not yet, mainly because we have been so busy exploring our own
aesthetic identity that we've simply had no time to do so. This is, however,
definitely on top of our to-do list, and I am hoping we will be
performing other *Ork repertoire before the end of this year.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> What notable new possibilities present themselves to the composer
writing for a laptop orchestra?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> I think L2Ork's versatility is at this point probably more limited by
our imagination than its infrastructure, and I suspect this will remain true
for some time to come. After all, at the heart of L2Ork infrastructure is a
laptop, which by its very nature can take on so many different roles. This
is something I find to be tremendously exciting, and this is what attracted
me to the laptop orchestra concept in the first place.
</p><p>
Imagine having an ensemble where each performer's action, apart from
producing sound, also alters someone else's instrument. What if these
interdependencies were evolving, changing over time in a way one could not
even begin to fathom, cascading complexities that may arise from such
treatment of a musical material. Or, what about having a group of L2Orkists
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> making sound collaboratively sculpt a 3-D sculpture whose shape is
also affected by the sound produced by the rest of the ensemble and whose
resulting properties somehow feed back into other domains, affecting
instruments, lighting, or theatre, or something else.
On a more conservative side, just having full awareness of what everyone
else is doing within the ensemble can be used in all kinds of cool and experimental
ways to shape a piece's structure and consequently its drama. For instance, a
composer may request that a certain group of performers maintain a certain
amount of activity, which is generated by averaging actions from everyone
within that group. As material becomes more abstract, this quickly becomes
an invaluable tool to monitor the overall output. And the list goes on as
far as one's imagination can muster.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> What notable challenges&mdash;administrative, technical, musical,
personal&mdash;have you encountered while directing L2Ork?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> Let's just say that working with L2Ork is as trying as it is exciting.
I think to be able to truly attain understanding of and control over L2Ork,
one has to be comfortable with juggling many different roles: being an
engineer, computer scientist, user-interface designer, composer, performer and
so on. Often, these roles tend to overlap, and I found this to be particularly
exhausting.
</p><p>
Last semester must have been one of the busiest semesters I've had since I
joined Virginia Tech, if not in my entire academic career. I probably would
never have bothered if I did not think that the potential benefits weren't
worth it. In this respect, I feel L2Ork did not disappoint.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> What are some of your long-range goals for L2Ork?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> I am not sure if we have any big long-term plans, in part because we are
still so overwhelmed with the existing possibilities that we've had little
time to think five or ten years ahead. Another consideration is the pace at
which technology changes. Who knows, perhaps in five years the entire
ensemble will have technology embedded in their clothing.
</p><p>
Near-term, however, my focus is on growth both in numbers and in
repertoire, touring and strengthening ties with our peer *Ork ensembles,
encouraging Linux community participation, forming new Linux-based
*Orks and, of course, ensuring that we have adequate support to ensure
the initiative's long-term well being.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DP:</b></span> Anything or anyone else you'd like to mention?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>IB:</b></span> I would like to hereby extend my deepest gratitude to those who have
made L2Ork possible. This includes the entire Linux community and
particularly the members of the Linuxaudio.org community, our stakeholders,
sponsors, fans and supporters, as well as all the students for their efforts
and dedication and for having been brave enough to invest their time into
something so experimental.
