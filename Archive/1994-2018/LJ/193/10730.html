Developing custom channels for the Roku.

This month, the challenge is to write about Linux and entertainment. MythTV is cool,
but it's been covered. Boxee looks great, but someone beat me to that
punch. I was getting worried I wouldn't find something appropriate to cover
until my wife reminded me that the
device on which we were watching <span   class="emphasis"><em>Farscape</em></span> runs Linux, and
she suggested I see
if there was something worth discussing beyond the great selection
of documentaries. As luck would have it, there is quite a bit worth
writing about.
</p><p>
The device is the Roku Digital Video Player,
which launched in 2008. This tiny box uses Linux to stream Netflix video
to your television. Until recently, that was the only reason to get one,
but now, Roku has started announcing other channels of content (Major League
Baseball, Facebook, Pandora and more). It is interesting to see the
tiny little box expand its capability. Even more interesting is that Roku
has opened a developer program that allows anyone to create custom
channels for it.
</p><p>
Before I dive in, here's a little background. My wife is from
Seattle, Washington, and is a huge fan and supporter of the KEXP radio station. I have done
several projects in the past to bring KEXP to our home in San Antonio, 
Texas, but looking at
the Roku's capabilities, it seems like the perfect platform for bringing KEXP
on-demand to our living room.
</p><p>
The first step in becoming a developer is to go to the Roku.com Web site and
create an account in its portal. After that, click the link for
Developer. There is a small sign-up form where you agree to abide
by the rules of the developer program. Once completed, you can
download the SDK and get started.
</p><p>
Roku tries to honor its obligation to the GPL code involved in
allowing the Roku to work. If you visit
<a href="http://www.roku.com/support/gpl_rdvp.aspx" target="_self">www.roku.com/support/gpl_rdvp.aspx</a>, you can download tarballs of
software. One thing that struck me in reading the developer
agreement is the section that says &ldquo;Subject to the Grace Period, Your
Channel Application must at all times....iii. not contain any open-source
code or other restricted code that could require Roku to publicly post or
display any third-party notices or any modifications to such code.&rdquo; I
understand what the Roku folks are trying to protect themselves from. 
Apparently, parts of the Roku platform are licensed from third parties
(like the support for WMA), and Roku wants to keep
parts proprietary. I assume the MIT license is fine, but it sounds like
this environment might not be very friendly to the GPL. I posted a
question to the developer forum but did not get any response by the
time I had submitted this article for publication. 
</p><p>
Assuming you still are interested in the platform, you have three different
options for deploying a channel: push it to a local Roku, create
it as a private channel or get it approved as a public channel.
</p><p>
The public channel requires Roku's approval. Once it's
approved, Roku offers it in the channel store on the Web site.
This is the path to take if you are building a
channel for public consumption. The private channel allows you to roll out
your channel to people. The upside is you don't need
Roku's approval to roll it out. The downside is that more steps are involved
in getting the channel onto a Roku. The local push is designed for the
development phase of your channel. Once you enable development on a Roku
(use a remote to enter Home 3x, Up 2x, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right),
you can just upload your channel. The SDK includes a handy Makefile to
make this incredibly easy. This is how I have done all of my development,
as I'm developing channels for myself (and other developers). The main
limitation of this last form of development is that you can have only one
&ldquo;development&rdquo; channel installed at a time. That did not pose much
of a problem for me, but if you're sharing code, it could make things more
complicated.
</p><p>
Roku development is all done in BrightScript, which appears to be a custom
language that combines ideas from Visual Basic and JavaScript. The main
goal is to allow you to write code in a dynamic language that can
easily compile down to efficient code for the Roku's embedded environment.
This is accomplished by adding in BrightScript Components, such as
default screens and media tools. You use BrightScript to customize the
screens and build up your channel. There is even a PowerPoint
presentation template to allow you to mock up your application
screens easily.

Getting Down to Business</h2></div></div><p>
All the code for this article is being shared at
<a href="http://github.com/economysizegeek/linux_journal_roku" target="_self">github.com/economysizegeek/linux_journal_roku</a>. This will make it a
lot easier to see the different channels. Simply <tt  >git clone</tt> that repository,
and you will have the latest version of all the code. I assume you have
turned on developer mode for your Roku. You also need to set an
environment variable in your shell so that the Makefile will know where to
push the code. In my case, I added <tt  >export
ROKU_DEV_TARGET=192.168.210.244</tt>
to my .bashrc. Make sure you put in the IP address of your Roku.
</p><p>
Let's start by doing a simple Hello World! example. This will get you
familiar with the tools and also confirm that you have everything working.
In the git repository is a directory called hello_world. Inside that
directory, you should be able to type <tt  >make install</tt>, and it will 
push a new channel onto your Roku automatically. If that doesn't work, confirm
that you have make, curl and zip installed (the Makefile depends on them).
Also make sure your Roku is in Dev Mode (enter the key combo from this article).
Additionally, ensure that you didn't set the environment variable (<tt  >echo
$ROKU_DEV_TARGET</tt> should
print an IP), and
check that you didn't set it to the wrong IP (the Roku's IP can be confirmed in
Settings&rarr;Player Info).
</p><p>
Once you have sorted that out, you should be able to go to the Roku and see
a new channel called &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. Clicking on it with your
remote will start the channel. It doesn't actually do anything other than
say &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; The point is to confirm your environment and give
you a quick-and-dirty tour of what you need to start making your own
channel.
</p><p>
In the hello_world directory, you will see two directories and a few files.
The images directory has a variety of images needed for this small
application. You will notice that some have HD and some have SD in their
names. This represents High Definition and Standard Definition. Because the
Roku is connected to a television, you have to make sure any art you display
is sized correctly for the TV screen. The Makefile is there to make it
easy to compile, install and remove the channel. The manifest file is
required by the Roku to build the package on the other side. That
just leaves the source directory and the HelloWorld.brs file (Listing 1). The brs file is
the BrightScript that actually sets up the channel.

Let's do a walk-through of
the code, but if the version you get from the git repository is different, it
means I fixed a bug after this went to press.
</p><p>
The first code listing is a crash course in BrightScript. All it does is
create a Main that builds a single screen and exits on any button push.
The print statements are spit out to the Roku console. The console also
allows you to enter a debugger and see any syntax errors. You can access
the Roku console by entering <tt  >telnet $ROKU_DEV_TARGET 8085</tt>. I had to use it
a couple times to find out why the channel wasn't showing up (which
often means there is a syntax error).
</p><p>
As you can see, I created a function called Main. This is the entry point
for all BrightScript applications. I included two different print
statements. The first one works, but the second one only prints out a blank
line, because a single quote is considered a comment in BrightScript. Then,
I created two objects. The roMessagePort is where messages (events) are
sent. The roSpringboardScreen is a BrightScript component. This is
basically a screen you can reconfigure by providing information. Roku
ships with a number of these screens for your use. I chose this one
because it was the easiest to work with. I connect the screen and the
port. This tells the system to send all events from the screen to the
message port I created. There probably are cases where you need to have
different message ports for different events, but so far, I have used only a
single message port shared with every screen. 
</p><p>
Then, I create a
roAssociativeArray. This is very much like a hash (or a plain JavaScript
object). I use it to set up up a number of predefined fields. This gets
passed into the screen. Next, I create a single button on the screen and
tell the system to draw the screen. The last step is to set up an infinite
loop. The wait allows the system to sit until an event is triggered. Then, I can
have the result of that event processed. In this case, it means
the program exits.

Rocking Out</h2></div></div><p>
The next step was to add in another BrightScript component&mdash;namely
roAudioPlayer. This component handles playing MP3 streams. I wrote a new
script from scratch to do this. The channel to handle streaming is in
the kexp directory. The main file (Listing 2) is in the source/KEXP.brs (at
<a href="http://github.com/economysizegeek/linux_journal_roku" target="_self">github.com/economysizegeek/linux_journal_roku</a>).

Listing 2 is for this channel. It is different in two main
ways. First, this time, the event loop actually looks at the button being
pushed. The loop is now able to trigger a different behavior depending on
the index value of the button that was pushed. The other change is that I
created an application object. I wanted to demonstrate that Roku has
provided an incredibly dynamic language, so I built it up much the same way
you would in JavaScript. The one odd thing to notice is the use of
&ldquo;m.&rdquo; inside the methods for the app object. The &ldquo;m.&rdquo; is a
pointer to the object. You can read it as &ldquo;this.&rdquo;, because that is
how Roku is resolving it when it gets compiled.
</p><p>
The event code is also tracking the state of the stream itself. The
roAudioPlayer considers it an error if you try to pause a stream that is
not playing or try to resume a stream that is not paused. The code handles
those cases. It also handles shutting down the stream when you exit.
</p><p>
With a working streaming application in hand, I started trying to get the
&ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; portion of the KEXP Web site integrated into it. The first
step was to navigate to a show and find a URL for a single show. This
took some work, because the on-demand programs are served using a
different protocol and URL from the live feed. Eventually, I was able to
get a URL by downloading and opening files that the KEXP server provides.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, I ran into a Roku platform limitation. It does not
support the codec that KEXP is using. Currently, there is no way for a
third-party developer to add additional codec support. Because the live
stream is available in MP3, the Roku handles it fine, which has been the
case for a number of the radio feeds I looked at. So, if the stream you
want to use streams via Flash or some other codec, you may be out of luck
as well. Roku also supports WMA, but that seems to be more for files
than streams.
</p><p>
For this article, I wrote everything from scratch. When you are working on
your own projects, you won't need to do that. Roku includes a number of
different sample applications in the SDK. The code gives a great tour of
the components and how they can be used, including audio, video, XML
parsing and handling a registration process. Those examples also are a lot
more polished than the code I have provided here (they include examples of how
to create your own theme for the channel). 
</p><p>
The next thing to play with is video streaming. I chose to focus on audio
for this article, because it's very straightforward.
Streaming video means obtaining a video source, as well as encoding
it properly, and then you have to generate an XML document to describe it.
You will need a Web server that can serve both the video and the XML. Once
you have everything working, you should be able to run your own little
Netflix-style video-streaming service. Now that you have your feet wet
with Roku development, head over to Brian Lane's blog. He has
documented some hacking he's done to get all of this working
(<a href="http://blog.brianlane.com/2009/12/20/streaming-local-video-with-your-roku" target="_self">blog.brianlane.com/2009/12/20/streaming-local-video-with-your-roku</a>).
</p><p>
My goal with this article was to get streaming up for my wife (which I mostly
achieved&mdash;I'm still working on getting the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shake the
Shack</em></span> show on demand). I was
incredibly surprised at how easy it was to get up and hacking. Originally, I was
turned off by having to deal with a new language, but
BrightScript is close enough to JavaScript that it wasn't the
hurdle I thought it would be. For me, the best part is that the Roku 
already had earned its place in my AV rack thanks to Netflix. Adding the
ability to hack on it and the opportunity to try channels other people have
built makes it that much more awesome.
