A look at one of the best-known contenders in the non-relational database space.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbdc580.0xcd4358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Lately I've been teaching programming courses in both Python and
Ruby, often to seasoned developers used to C++ and Java. Inevitably,
the fact that Python and Ruby are dynamically typed languages,
allowing any variable to contain any type of value, catches these
students by surprise. They often are shocked to find that a given
variable can, at any point in the program, be assigned to contain an
integer, a string or an instance of an object, without any
constraints. They wonder how it is that anyone could (or would) use
such a language, given the possibility for runtime type errors. One of
my jobs, as the instructor of this course, is to convince them that it
is possible to work in such a language, but that doing so might
require more adherence to conventions than they are used to.
</p><p>
So, it's ironic that during the last few months, as I have begun to
experiment with non-relational databases, that I have found myself
experiencing something akin to my students' shock. My
long-standing beliefs about data integrity and what constitutes a
reliable database have gone through a bit of a shake-up. I'm still a
bit wary of these non-relational (or NoSQL) databases, and I'm far
from convinced that the time has come to throw out SQL and the
relational model in favor of something that is often easier to work
with.
</p><p>
I do think, as I outlined in last month's column, that these databases
offer a type of storage and retrieval that often is a more natural fit
for many data-storage requirements. And, just as memcached offered an
alternative storage system that complemented relational databases
rather than replacing them, so too can these non-relational databases
perform many useful functions that would be difficult with a
relational database.
</p><p>
One of the best-known contenders in the non-relational database space
is MongoDB. MongoDB is an open-source project, sponsored by New
York-based 10gen (which intends to make money from licensing and
support fees). It is written in C++, and there are drivers for all
popular modern libraries. The software is licensed under the Affero
GNU General Public License, which means if you modify the MongoDB
source, and if those modifications are available on a publicly
accessible Web site, you must distribute the source to your
modifications. This is different from the standard GPL, which does
not require that you divulge the source code to server-side
applications with which people interact via a browser or other Internet
client.
</p><p>
MongoDB has gained a large number of adherents because of its
combination of features. It is easy to work with from a variety of
languages, is extremely fast (written in C++), is actively
supported by both a company and a large community and has proven
itself to be stable in many situations and under high-stress
conditions. It also includes a number of features for indexing and
scaling that make it attractive.
</p><p>
MongoDB, like several of its competitors, describes itself as a
document database. This does not mean it is a filesystem meant
to store documents, but rather that it replaces the model of tables,
rows and columns with that of &ldquo;documents&rdquo; consisting of one or more
name-value pairs. I find it easier to think of documents as hash
tables (or Python dictionaries), in which the keys are strings and the
values can be just about anything. Each of these documents exists in
a collection, and you can have one or more collections.
</p><p>
In many ways, you can think of MongoDB as an object database, because it
allows you to store and retrieve items as objects, rather than force
them into two-dimensional tables. However, this object database
stores only basic object types&mdash;numbers, strings, lists and hashes,
for example. Fortunately, these types can store a wide variety of
data, flexibly and reliably, so this is not much of a concern.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbdc580.0xcd47d0"></a>
Downloading and Installing</h2></div></div><p>
To download MongoDB, go to <a href="http://mongodb.org" target="_self">mongodb.org</a>, and retrieve the version
appropriate for your system. For my server running Ubuntu
8.10, I retrieved the 32-bit version of MongoDB 1.2.2. There is an
option to retrieve a statically linked version, but the site itself
indicates that this is a fallback, in case the dynamically linked
version fails.
</p><p>
After unpacking the MongoDB server, create a directory in
which it can store its data. By default, this is /data/db, which you can
create with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /data/db
</pre>
</p><p>
Start the MongoDB server process with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./bin/mongod
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that you have a server running, you need to create a database.
However, this step is unnecessary. If you try to connect to a
database that has not yet been defined, MongoDB creates it for
you. I tend to do most of my MongoDB work in Ruby, so I downloaded
and installed the driver for Ruby from GitHub and started up the
interactive Ruby interpreter, irb. Then, I typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):001:0&gt; require 'rubygems'
irb(main):002:0&gt; require 'mongo'
</pre>
</p><p>
With the MongDB driver loaded, I was able to connect to the
already-running server, creating an &ldquo;atf&rdquo; database:


<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):005:0&gt; db = Mongo::Connection.new.db("atf")
</pre>
</p><p>
After this, db is an instance of the Mongo::DB class, representing a
MongoDB database. Each database may contain any number of
collections, analogous to tables in a relational database. By
default, this example database contains no collections, as you can see with this
small snippet of code:



<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):008:0&gt; db.collection_names.each { |name| puts name }
=&gt; [ ]
</pre>
</p><p>
The return value of an empty list shows that the database is currently
empty.
</p><p>
You can create a new collection by invoking the collection method on
your database connection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):012:0&gt; c = db.collection("stuff")
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have created your collection, you also can see that MongoDB has
silently created a second collection, named system.indexes, used for
indexing the contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):032:0&gt; db.collection_names
=&gt; ["stuff", "system.indexes"]
</pre>
</p><p>
Because MongoDB is a schema-less database, you can begin to store items
to your collection immediately, without defining its columns or data
types. In practice, this means you can store hashes with any
keys and values that you choose. For example, you can use the insert
method to add a new item to your collection:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):017:0&gt; c.insert({:a =&gt; 1, :b =&gt; 2})
=&gt; 4b6fe8983c1c7d6a6a000001
</pre>
</p><p>
The return value is the unique ID for this document (or object) that
has just been stored. You can ask the collection to show what you
have stored by invoking its find_one method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):021:0&gt; c.find_one
=&gt; {"_id"=&gt;4b6fe8983c1c7d6a6a000001, "a"=&gt;1, "b"=&gt;2}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that two things have happened here. First, the keys have been
turned from Ruby symbols into strings. Indeed, MongoDB requires that
all keys be strings; because symbols are used so pervasively in the
Ruby world for hash keys, they are translated into strings
silently
if you use them.
</p><p>
Second, you can see that another key, named _id, has been added to
the document, and its value matches the return value that you received
with your first insert.
</p><p>
You can ask the collection to tell how many documents it contains
with the count method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):026:0&gt; c.count
=&gt; 1
</pre>
</p><p>
As you might expect, you can store and retrieve data using any number
of different languages. Although you are likely to work in a single
language, MongoDB (like relational databases) doesn't care what
language you use and lets you mix and match them freely.
</p><p>
In the above examples, I used Ruby to store data. I should be able to
retrieve this data using Python, as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pymongo
&gt;&gt;&gt; from pymongo import Connection
&gt;&gt;&gt; connection = Connection()
&gt;&gt;&gt; db = connection.atf
&gt;&gt;&gt; db.collection_names()
   [u'stuff', u'system.indexes']
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = db.stuff

&gt;&gt;&gt; c
   Collection(Database(Connection('localhost', 27017), u'atf'), 
 &#8618;u'stuff')

&gt;&gt;&gt; c.find_one()
   {u'a': 1, u'_id': ObjectId('4b6fe8983c1c7d6a6a000001'), u'b': 2}
</pre>
</p><p>
The only surprises here are probably that the strings are all stored
as Unicode, represented with the <tt  >u''</tt> syntax in Python 2.6 (which I am
using here). Also, the document ID, with the key of _id, still
is there, but is an object, rather than a string.
</p><p>
You also can see that the MongoDB developers have gone to great
efforts to keep the APIs similar across different languages. This
means if you work in more than one language, you likely will be
able to depend on similar (or identical) method names to perform the
same task.

Queries</h2></div></div><p>
The find_one method, as you have seen, returns a single element from
a collection. A similar find method returns all of the elements
using the Enumerable module, allowing you to iterate over all of the
documents in a collection using each. For example, if you add
another document:


<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):026:0&gt; c.insert({'name' =&gt; 'Reuven',
                           'email_address' =&gt; 'reuven@lerner.co.il'})
=&gt; 4b6ff0693c1c7d6ecd000001
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbdc580.0xcd5698"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you can retrieve the IDs as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):030:0&gt; c.find.each {|i| puts i['_id']}
4b6fe8983c1c7d6a6a000001
4b6ff0693c1c7d6ecd000001
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how you can pull out the _id column by treating the
document as a hash. Indeed, if you ask Ruby to show the class of the
object, rather than its ID, this suspicion is confirmed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):031:0&gt; c.find.each {|i| puts i.class}
OrderedHash
OrderedHash
</pre>
</p><p>
But, perhaps you're interested only in some of the documents. By
invoking find with a hash, it will return only those documents that
match the contents of your hash. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):040:0&gt; c.find({'name' =&gt; 'Reuven'}).count
=&gt; 1
</pre>
</p><p>
If nothing matches the hash that you passed, you will get an empty
result set:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):041:0&gt; c.find({'name' =&gt; 'Reuvennn'}).count
=&gt; 0
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can search for regular expressions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):042:0&gt; c.find({'name' =&gt; /eu/}).count
=&gt; 1

irb(main):043:0&gt; c.find({'name' =&gt; /ez/}).count
=&gt; 0
</pre>
</p><p>
By passing a hash as the value for a key, you also can modify the
query, passing parameters that define MongoDB's query syntax. These
query operators all begin with the dollar sign ($) and are passed as
the key to a sub-hash. For example, you can retrieve all of the
documents whose &ldquo;name&rdquo; is one of the values in a specified
array, as
follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):049:0&gt; c.find({'name' =&gt;
                           {'$in' =&gt; ['Reuven', 'Atara', 'Shikma',
 &#8618;'Amotz'] }  }
                       ).count
=&gt; 1
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can sort the results by invoking the sort method on the
result set, using a similar syntax:


<pre     class="programlisting">
irb(main):049:0&gt; c.find({'name' =&gt;
                           {'$in' =&gt; ['Reuven', 'Atara', 'Shikma',
 &#8618;'Amotz'] }  }
                       ).sort({"name" =&gt; 1})
</pre>
</p><p>
Just as you can sort a result set, you also can perform other actions
on it that are analogous to several relational counterparts, such as
grouping and limiting the number of results. If you are used to a
functional style of programming, in which you chain a number of
methods to one another, this style easily will lend itself to
working with MongoDB.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
MongoDB is causing many ripples in the open-source and database
worlds because of its high performance and easy learning curve. This
month, I covered the basics of installing and working with MongoDB.
Next month, I'll look at some more-advanced topics, such as indexing
(which makes queries execute much faster), embedding objects in one
another and referencing objects across collections.

Finally, I continue to think that there are parallels between dynamic
languages and document-oriented databases. Steve Yegge, an engineer
at Google, has written about the growing popularity of dynamic
languages, and I strongly recommend his presentation for an
interesting perspective on the issue:
