Safentrix's Cloud-Based Hosted E-mail Security Service</h2></div></div><p>
Safentrix bills its new and free cloud-based hosted e-mail security service
as the world's first to offer outbound e-mail security. The service
provides spam and virus filtering for incoming e-mail as well. The firm
says its product provides peace of mind to organizations worried
about misused e-mail servers, given that the majority of spam results from
this misuse. Other key features include compatibility with all common
e-mail servers, a control panel secured with high-grade encryption,
a geographically dispersed network with multiple redundant servers,
near-zero false positives, near-zero maintenance, up to 20,000 users

Sam Lightstone's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making it Big in Software</em></span> (Prentice Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
Got the drive to be a software legend but lacking the road map to get
there? You might want to pick up Sam Lightstone's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making it Big
in Software: Get the Job. Work the Org. Become Great.</em></span> from Prentice Hall.
Lightstone covers the road to the top in a step-by-step manner, from
landing a job with great potential, to moving your way up and then blazing
your way to the pinnacle. He says that everything has changed radically
in &ldquo;the biz&rdquo;, and professors and career counselors never tell you the
complete story. Other topics include mastering nontechnical skills
crucial for success; understanding the &ldquo;sweet science&rdquo; of software
R&amp;D; &ldquo;working the org&rdquo; to move up rapidly; managing time, projects and
life; and even breaking out into entrepreneurship. Also included are 17
interviews with legends such as Steve Wozniak, Marc Benioff and our own
personal fave, Linus Torvalds.

and dimensioning; libraries of standard mechanical parts (ANSI, DIN);
calculations of standard mechanical components; and tools for working
with bills of materials (BOM) and blocks. Version 2010 2.0 adds new
features, such as geometric constraints among entire solids, advanced
tools for working with Boolean trees, a significantly improved user
interface and improved DWG import. A free 30-day trial version is
available for download.

Wolfram Research's Workbench</h2></div></div><p>
Speaking of Mathematica, that application's maker, Wolfram Research, has
released version 2 of Workbench, an Eclipse-based IDE that is specialized
for Mathematica and other Wolfram technologies. The platform, says
Wolfram, &ldquo;combines Mathematica's ever-growing programming language and
world-renowned computation, visualization and modeling features with
one of the world's leading IDEs&rdquo;. Developers, thus, enjoy the luxury of
working with any Eclipse-supported language. New in version 2 is the
ability to create documentation for Mathematica applications, as well as
a host of improvements to code editing and navigation. Workbench requires
Mathematica 6 or higher and is compatible with Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
Workbench is also a key tool internally for Wolfram for the development
of Mathematica, Wolfram|Alpha and other technologies.

Ksplice Uptrack Service</h2></div></div><p>
Likening this service to changing out a car's engine while speeding
down the highway, Ksplice Uptrack from Ksplice, Inc., eliminates the
need to reboot Linux servers to reboot their kernels. Thus, crucial
updates and security patches can be applied live without rebooting or
disrupting running applications. Ksplice Uptrack subscriptions are
currently available for six leading versions of Linux including Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian GNU/Linux, CentOS, Parallels Virtuozzo
Containers and OpenVZ.

Android mobile development, FancyPants supports digital video (STB,
DVR, home-media center), office automation (printers and MFPs) and other
consumer electronics and industrial automation areas. FancyPants further
enables total separation of user interfaces from applications that use
them, offering developers &ldquo;a unique autonomous user-interface model,
enabling comprehensive deep customization of Android device GUIs on a
per-application, or suite of applications, basis&rdquo;.
