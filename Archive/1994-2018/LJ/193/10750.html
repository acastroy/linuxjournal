Anyone who ever has been to a Linux or open-source conference knows that
Linux geeks know how to have fun. Whether it's a late-night Atari 2600
fragfest (Penguicon 2009) or the SourceForge parties at OSCON (pretty much
every year, from what I can tell), Linux is not just for work. We
figured <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> shouldn't just be for work either, and with summer
right around the corner, we decided to dedicate this month to entertainment.
Oh, and if you are reading this in the southern hemisphere? Well, summer
is right around the corner for you too&mdash;it's just a larger corner!
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts out the issue with an article on MongoDB. I suspect
he chose the topic because MongoDB is an entertaining name, but whatever
Reuven's motivation, MongoDB is an interesting non-relational database.
This month, he shows us how to install and work with Mongo. Next month, we'll
get down and dirty with it. Dave Taylor, on the other hand, gets down and
dirty this month with HTML forms and shell scripts. If that sounds like an
odd mix, be sure to check out his column, because Dave is doing
some cool things with seemingly mundane HTML forms.
</p><p>
If you're like me, entertainment generally means either reading a book or
watching TV. When you're a Linux user, watching TV probably is a bit more
geeky than it is for the rest of the world, and this issue, we have a lot of
toys to cover. We start with Dirk Elmendorf's Economy Size Geek column. I've talked about the Roku
device several times in past issues, and although it's unlikely my pleading is
what got the company to open up development for its product, for
whatever reason, Roku decided it was time. Dirk shows us how to create
custom channels for the Roku and explains how to install them for your
Roku-riffic enjoyment. If the Roku isn't up your alley or, at the very
least, isn't in your entertainment center, perhaps Michael J. Hammel's
article comparing MythTV and XBMC is more your cup of tea. Both programs
are designed for consuming multimedia, and both programs are amazingly
awesome. Michael does the heavy lifting for us, and he shows the ins and outs
of these highly functional, if not slightly different, programs.
</p><p>
In order to enjoy a video on your computer or living-room entertainment
center, it's important to get that video in a format that is playable.
Anthony Dean shows us Handbrake this month, which does a great job of
converting DVDs into formats playable on pretty much every device on the
planet. I use Handbrake to convert DVDs so I can watch them on my Nokia
N900, which obviously doesn't have a DVD player of its own. Although
Handbrake will convert videos for the N900, playing movies certainly is not
all the little handheld computer is capable of doing. Kyle Rankin has a
review this month of his N900, and you'll want to check it out.
</p><p>
It's possible television really isn't your idea of entertainment. We
totally understand that. Whether you just want to play music, or you want
an entire orchestra in your laptop, we've got you covered. Dave Phillips
looks at L20rk, which is much more than a bunch of MIDI files playing
together like an orchestra. Maybe that's more than you're up for, and you
just want to listen to music on your computer. Sometimes the hardest part
is choosing which program to use for the playing. Windows and Macintosh
users generally choose between WMP and iTunes, but in Linux, we have a
wide variety of players. This month, Bruce Byfield breaks down five of the
more common ones for us. Even if you are a die-hard XMMS fan, you'll want
to check out Bruce's article comparing Amarok, Banshee, Exaile, Rhythmbox
and Songbird.
</p><p>
Finally, we realize many of you are cyborgs and have little interest in
human entertainment. Or, perhaps you're just the type of person who
prefers to secure your network for fun. Well, we care about you too, and
Mick Bauer and Kyle Rankin will keep you entertained this month with the
continuation of their articles on OpenVPN and network troubleshooting.
When you add the product reviews, UpFront articles, New Products and Doc
Searls' look at distribution models, we have an issue that is certain to
please. Hopefully, it will even entertain. As for me, I'm getting ready
for Penguicon 2010. Although I don't think we'll have another Atari 2600
battle, I'm sure it will be great. With a bunch of Linux geeks, it's hard
not to have fun!
