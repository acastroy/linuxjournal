gbrainy&mdash;Brain Teaser
(<a href="http://live.gnome.org/gbrainy" target="_self">live.gnome.org/gbrainy</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
People interested in sharpening their mental faculties in an
environment that is genuinely challenging would do well to give this a
go. According to gbrainy's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
gbrainy is a brain-teaser game and trainer to have fun and to keep
your brain trained. It provides the following types of games:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Logic puzzles: games designed to challenge your reasoning and
thinking skills.
</p></li><li><p>
Mental calculation: games based on arithmetical operations designed
to prove your mental calculation skills.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory trainers: games designed to challenge your short-term memory.
</p></li><li><p>
Verbal analogies: games that challenge your verbal aptitude.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
gbrainy provides different difficulty levels, making gbrainy enjoyable
for kids, adults or senior citizens. It also features player's game
history, player's personal records, tips for the player, or fullscreen
mode. gbrainy also can be extended easily with new games developed by
third parties. 
</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
For those chasing binaries, packages are available for Debian, Ubuntu,
Fedora, SUSE, Mandriva, One Laptop Per Child and NetBSD. Also available
is the obligatory source tarball, and for those who want to run the
bleeding-edge version, you can grab it using git. I won't be covering how
to run git here, but nevertheless, I will incorporate git users into a line
of my instructions. As usual, I'm going with the source tarball.
</p><p>
Here are the library requirements, according to the gbrainy Web site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
intltool 0.35 or higher.
</p></li><li><p>
Mono 1.1.7 or higher.
</p></li><li><p>
GTK and GTK Sharp 2.8 or higher.
</p></li><li><p>
librsvg 2.2 or higher.
</p></li><li><p>
Cairo 1.2 or higher.
</p></li><li><p>
Mono.Addins 0.3 or higher.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And, also according to the Web site, for a standard Ubuntu installation, the
packages required for compiling
gbrainy are intltool, mono-gmcs, mono-devel, libmono-dev, libgnome2-dev,
libgnomeui-dev and libmono-cairo2.0-cil. 
</p><p>
Download the latest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the new folder. 
If you've downloaded the development git version, before carrying on, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./autogen.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
For everyone else, simply enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro doesn't use sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that compilation doesn't seem to require the use of make. 
Once the installation is finished, run the program with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gbrainy
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once you're inside, using gbrainy is pretty straightforward. The
GUI layout and design are excellent, along with many other functions,
such as text input, difficulty settings and so on. gbrainy even has a
special setting to adjust for the color blind. 
Starting out in gbrainy is obvious. There are buttons
for testing the following subjects: Logic, Calculation, Memory, Verbal or All
(for taking every subject at once).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10733f1.large.jpg"><img src="10733f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
gbrainy presents you with challenging mathematical problems that often test your
spatial abilities alongside arithmetic.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10733f2.large.jpg"><img src="10733f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Interesting sequences and lateral thinking often play a part in 
gbrainy's Logic section.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10733f3.large.jpg"><img src="10733f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
In the Memory tests, you'll find yourself using different ways to memorize things
from
what you may have done previously, especially when
you're given such a short time limit.
</p></div></div><p>
As each test starts, bear in mind that most questions aren't in the
realm of &ldquo;mildly taxing&rdquo;. Even on the default medium setting, most of
these questions are quite tricky. It quickly will become apparent which
subjects you have a knack for and which you'll struggle with.
</p><p>
Logic uses puzzles, such as number and block sequences, grid layouts
and so on, generally for guessing the next number or arrangement in a
sequence.
</p><p>
Calculation typically has you guessing for the closest number to
something, using very thought-intensive divisions, multiplications,
averages and so on, that seem to move beyond basic arithmetic skills.
</p><p>
Memory introduces a time factor, so pay close attention. Things such
as a series of directions, a grid containing different objects or words
spelling out colors that are actually colored with something different
(such as the word yellow colored blue) are shown on-screen for a very
short amount of time, and you'll be asked about an individual element
that's usually pretty hard to recall.
</p><p>
And finally, there's Verbal, which plays games like
finding the odd word out, identifying the word most suitable for a given situation,
choosing what word can be used in relation to a certain word pairing and so on.
</p><p>
Thankfully, the text input is very dynamic in that the developers
have thought ahead about what possible combinations people may enter,
so chances are if you enter something in a different case or some
other kind of textual variation, the input accepts it
or instructs you as to how to answer the question.
</p><p>
All in all, this is a very challenging package. 
I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a
mainstay of educational distros, but hopefully, it catches on in standard
distributions as well.

Step Into Chinese&mdash;Language-Mining and Flashcard System
(<a href="http://new.asymptopia.org/staticpages/index.php?page=StepIntoChinese" target="_self">new.asymptopia.org/staticpages/index.php?page=StepIntoChinese</a></h2></div></div><p>
If you've been playing around with other flashcard systems trying to
learn Chinese or perhaps running into problems with
switching between Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Pinyin, 
this may be the project for you. To quote the Freshmeat page
and parts of the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Step Into Chinese is a flexible language-mining and flashcard system
to assist English speakers seeking to understand the Chinese language. It
was designed to address the lack of a one-to-one correspondence between
Chinese characters and corresponding Pinyin morphemes.
</p><p>
The lack of a one-to-one correspondence between Chinese characters and
the corresponding Pinyin is often regarded as the greatest difficulty
facing learners of Chinese. Step Into Chinese has been designed to
address exactly this difficulty.
</p><p>
Inside is an extensively cross-referenced data structure that allows
the user to pursue deeper understanding of contexts, for example, by
&ldquo;locking on&rdquo; to a particular Pinyin context and viewing successive
instances of the same morpheme used in similar contexts.
</p><p>
The user can also &ldquo;lock on&rdquo; to English words in the Pinyin
translations, English words in the collective phrase translations,
and even Unicode strings used to represent Chinese characters in either
traditional or simplified representations. Frequency information relative
to the number of occurrences of each Pinyin morpheme, in each context
throughout the data structure, is displayed for each entry.
</p><p>
The application data structure contains over 26,000 modern Chinese
words and concepts, corresponding to over 8,300 separate Chinese
characters. Colors are used consistently throughout the application for
rapid location and absorption of information. 
</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Apologies for the long project URL above&mdash;you're probably better off
just visiting the main page at <a href="http://new.asymptopia.org" target="_self">new.asymptopia.org</a>. Why this
confusion? Well, Step Into Chinese (SIC) is part of a collection of
software developed by Asymtopia Software, a grass-roots open-source
development company. In order to download SIC, you first need to
create an account at the Web site, but don't worry, it's &ldquo;free and only
to prevent excessive download abuse by non-humans&rdquo;. It also allows you
to participate on the Web site. I'm interested in several projects from
Asymtopia and probably will be highlight them in the coming months,
so you might want to go ahead and make an account now.
</p><p>
Before I go further, in terms of library requirements, you
need to install the pygame libraries, which on my Kubuntu system were
named python-pygame. As far as package options go, there seems to
be only a .tar.gz file (no binaries), but don't fret, the installation is
easy. Download the newest tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in
the new folder.
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo setup.py
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro doesn't use sudo, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# setup.py
</pre>
</p><p>
From here, you can run the program with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ stepintochinese
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
First, a screen displays the status of some postprocessing,
which has to do with Pinyin morphemes and their usage contexts. This
may take a minute, but let it be. Soon you'll be inside the
main screen. To give you an idea how it works, SIC already will have
a word entered (that word being hello) and in the process of being
displayed in &ldquo;screensaver mode&rdquo;, where each English word is shown along
with its Chinese translation in both Pinyin (Romanized letters) and
Chinese characters, which can be set to either Traditional or Simplified.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10733f4.large.jpg"><img src="10733f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Step Into Chinese allows you to look up English words in both
Traditional and Simplified Chinese, as well as Pinyin.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10733f5.large.jpg"><img src="10733f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
You also can look up words in Chinese using Pinyin (Romanized letters);
here I'm displaying a word in Chinese Simplified.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10733f6.large.jpg"><img src="10733f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Taken from the Web site, this keyboard reference is an invaluable tool.
</p></div></div><p>
Now all this might be a bit confusing to take in at first, so let me
break it down for you. The word hello will be on-screen, but you'll
want to enter your own words to translate, so let's do that now. First,
press backspace once, and screensaver mode (which I'll explain in a minute)
will stop, allowing you to enter your own text. Now, keep pressing backspace
until hello is gone, enter your own text, and press Enter. Your word
now will appear in translated form above or at least a part of it in
another English word (for instance, &ldquo;car&rdquo; may be inside
&ldquo;careless&rdquo; or
&ldquo;carriage&rdquo; and so on).
</p><p>
If the displayed translation isn't the one you want, press Enter
again, and the next translation will be displayed. Keep pressing Enter, and
you can scroll through all translated possibilities. Note that SIC 
accepts only American English. As an Australian and like most of the English-speaking world, I actually speak British English (this is an American
publication; I don't normally spell this way), so entering something
like &ldquo;mum&rdquo; or &ldquo;colour&rdquo; turned up with nothing. So if your entry doesn't
produce any results, it might be that you're not using American English.
</p><p>
Let's move on to the screensaver mode. This is where the traditional
flashcard system comes into place. Press F3, and all of the possible
translation options will cycle through the display at a default rate
of ten-second intervals. If you want to use SIC as a screensaver
of sorts, pressing F12 puts SIC in full-screen mode.
</p><p>
As for Chinese characters, you probably will want to switch
between Chinese Traditional and Chinese Simplified, so press F2 to do so
for the standard display mode, and then press F4 for screensaver
mode.
</p><p>
So far, I've dealt only with English text input, and SIC isn't
restricted to that. You also can enter words in Chinese to display their
meaning, albeit in the Romanized Pinyin form (actual Chinese text input
is a much more complicated process in a non-Chinese OS setup, and this is
aimed at foreign international users after all). Pressing F1 switches
the search mode's parameters between English, Pinyin Chinese or Unicode
searches.
</p><p>
That's about all I have space for this month, but ultimately, my time
with Step Into Chinese has been a pleasant one. Although the interface
is initially confusing, once you've been introduced to the basics,
operating SIC actually is quite a simple process. I also like how the
Asymtopia folks have shown some artistic flair in using fonts that are
funky and colorful to make a pleasant working environment. SIC is highly
recommended.
