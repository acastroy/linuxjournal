In a world full of powerful Android devices, is the Nokia N900
the best Linux computer you can fit in your pocket?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x1153358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first time I thought about the N900 was about a year and a half
before it was ever released. I was at the Penguicon conference, and some
friends and I had settled down at a table to continue the time-honored
tradition of chatting with each other on IRC even though we were a few
feet away from each other. I noticed a friend take out a Nokia N800 and a
Bluetooth keyboard and proceed to chat and browse the Web as though
it were a laptop. I was amazed someone had managed to put together a
smaller computer than I had, which made me start to reconsider what
an ultraportable computer really was.
</p><p>
I always have preferred my portable computers to be, well,
portable. My very first laptop was a Toshiba Libretto 50CT, and it
was about the size of a VHS tape if you are old enough to know what
those are. Since then, all of my laptops have been in the ultraportable
category. As I looked at my friend's N800, I concluded that the main
things missing were a bit more speed and cellular connectivity. After
all, when the wireless was spotty at the conference, many of us were
tethered to our cell phones or air cards. I decided if Nokia's next
version of the Nseries was fast enough and had a cellular connection,
it would be the device for me.
</p><p>
It should come as no surprise that when Nokia announced the N900, I
was immediately intrigued. Would this be the new portable Linux computer
I was looking for? Also, as a sysadmin who shares on-call duties, did
I still need to drag my laptop around when I was on call, or could I do
everything from this device? I have been fortunate to be able to spend a
few months with an N900 Nokia provided me, and in this article, I review
the N900 from the perspective of a longtime Linux geek who wants to
know whether it can give me a small and open Linux device that can
replace a Netbook or even a laptop for portable computing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x1153618"></a>
Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
One of the things that could make or break the N900 as a Netbook/laptop
replacement is its hardware. As you'll see, the N900's hardware is a
hybrid between a Netbook and a smartphone. Here are some of the main
technical specs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
600MHz ARM Cortex-A8 (like in the iPhone 3GS, Palm Pre, Droid, Beagleboard and
Open Pandora).
</p></li><li><p>
256Mb RAM plus 768Mb swap on Flash.
</p></li><li><p>
3.5" 800x480 resistive touchscreen.
</p></li><li><p>
32Gb included storage + empty MicroSD slot for up to 16Gb more.
</p></li><li><p>
802.11b/g, quad-band unlocked GSM cellular connection and FM transmitter.
</p></li><li><p>
Bluetooth and microUSB port with tethering support over both.
</p></li><li><p>
5 megapixel camera, 3x digital zoom.
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated GPS with AGPS.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you are in the US, although the N900 is unlocked
and can be used on any GSM network, if you want 3G speeds, you will have
to use T-Mobile, as the N900 doesn't support AT&amp;T's 3G frequencies.
</p><p>
The box also includes headphones, power adapters and a TV-out cable,
but unfortunately, it's only a composite cable so you won't get the full
800x480 resolution of the native screen. Although it tends to work okay for a
movie or a video game, when I used it to show slides during a presentation,
the text was a bit difficult to read.
</p><p>
Finally, like the N810 before it, the N900 includes a slide-out hardware
keyboard suitable for thumb typing. The keyboard itself is a bit small
and has only three rows of keys and an offset spacebar that can throw
you until you get used to it. But, the keyboard feels
pretty solid, and after using it for a few weeks, I can type fast enough
to keep up in IRC. If you want to do extended typing on the N900, I
recommend investing in a larger keyboard. Unlike the prior Nseries,
there is no USB-host mode, so you'll need a Bluetooth keyboard.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x1153e00"></a>
The Maemo Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p>
A number of portable devices have similar
hardware specs to the N900, but what makes it different is the
software. Like the Nseries devices that preceded it, the N900 runs
Maemo&mdash;Nokia's Debian-based Linux distribution. Maemo really feels like
any other Debian-based distribution only optimized for a small
touchscreen.
Although you have custom desktop widgets, panels and application
management, behind the scenes, you'll find standard Linux systems like
apt-get, X, pulseaudio, upstart, dbus, gconf and sudo. Also, it's simple
to get root on Maemo without hacking firmware or voiding warranties. Simply
install the rootsh package that's available in the default repositories,
and type <tt  >sudo gainroot</tt> to get a root shell.
</p><p>
Maemo's desktop environment feels a lot like a slimmed-down,
touchscreen-friendly GNOME desktop. The desktop is one screen high and up
to four screens wide, and you can touch the screen and drag left or right
to switch between desktops. Figure 1 shows a somewhat tweaked version
of a Maemo desktop featuring shortcuts to some favorite applications,
but you also can put shortcuts to contacts, bookmarks or various widgets
on the desktop as well. Widgets act much like plasmoids or other desktop
widgets and let you manage the media player, check the weather, check
news or Twitter feeds, or do other similar tasks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10739f1.large.jpg"><img src="10739f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Maemo Desktop with the Matrix Theme
</p></div></div><p>
Along the top of the desktop is a bar that acts much like a panel on
GNOME or KDE. On the top left-hand corner is a button you use to switch
between desktops, an application launcher screen and an Expose-like
application switcher that shows all of your currently running applications
(Figure 2). This last feature is particularly well done and really makes
the N900 stand out for its multitasking abilities. You also can press
the Ctrl-Backspace shortcut keys to present the application switcher.
It is very easy to switch between
different programs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10739f2.large.jpg"><img src="10739f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x11543d8"></a>
Contact Integration</h2></div></div><p>
The contact list integration on the N900 is one of its
most compelling features. From a user-interface perspective, there is
little difference between sending an SMS, sending an instant message,
making a cell-phone call or calling someone via Skype or VoIP. All
of these communication methods can be integrated into each contact in
your contact list and are managed from a central settings page. There 
also are packages to extend IM support to all the major IM protocols. Once
you sign into an account for the first time, those contacts are added
to your contact list, so you can merge them with any existing contacts.
</p><p>
For instance, if I set my Skype account to be on-line, people in my
contact list who were currently on-line would have a little green dot
next to their contact, and if I had a contact shortcut on my desktop,
it would be there as well. If I want to IM or call people via the Skype network, all
I have to do is open their contact and click that particular option. If
any of my friends send me an SMS or an IM, it shows up in a standard IM
window. If they call my cell phone or Gizmo number or make a Skype call,
the N900 rings the same way in each case.
</p><p>
I've not mentioned the phone functionality much
because, honestly, I rarely use a cell phone for actual phone calls. I
hesitate to refer to the N900 as a phone at all, because although it
certainly can make phone calls, it's really more of a portable computer
than a phone. The phone feature seems to work fine for me, but if you
come to the N900 primarily to make phone calls, you will discover that
it's a portable computer first and a phone second or third.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10739f3.large.jpg"><img src="10739f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x1154748"></a>
Browser</h2></div></div><p>
A good deal of my time on a computer involves a Web
browser. Compared to many other portable devices, the browser on the N900
is among the best I've seen. Its MicroB browser is essentially a slimmed-down version of Firefox and renders pages like you'd expect in a regular
full-sized browser without the need to load a &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; version of a page.
</p><p>
Of course, most non-optimized Web sites do appear a little small on the 3.5"
screen. If you double-click on a section of a page, the browser zooms
in so that section fills the width of the browser. I really liked
this automatic zooming, especially for two- or three-column Web sites 
with content in one column and navigation bars on the sides. When
you zoom in on an article, the rest of the navigation zooms out past the
edges of the screen, so you can focus on what you want to read. You 
also can zoom with the hardware volume keys at the top of the device or 
make a clockwise or counter-clockwise gesture on the screen with
your finger.
</p><p>
The browser currently supports Flash 9.4. I've been able to view
regular streaming video fine, and full-screen mode works like you'd
expect. Certain Firefox add-ons, such as Adblock and Greasemonkey, also have 
been ported to the MicroB browser already, but because of the differences
between MicroB and standard Firefox, your favorite extension may or may
not work out of the box.
</p><p>
For average sites, the CPU seems to provide adequate performance and
even will render sites like Facebook, Google Calendar and Google Wave
fine. I've noticed that some JavaScript-heavy sites, like the non-mobile
version of Google Reader, do lag on the browser, and sites that use AJAX to
provide their own scrollbars (like Google Reader) can be a bit of a pain
to navigate. Overall though, I found I could browse the Web like on any
other browser. To me, this is a great advantage to the N900 versus other
mobile devices, as there has been a trend to write custom applications for
various sites (like Facebook) to overcome poor performance
on mobile browsers. On the N900, you don't really need a custom Facebook
application, as the regular site works fine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x1154a08"></a>
Terminal</h2></div></div><p>
When I'm not using a Web browser on a Linux machine, I'm in a terminal,
so the N900's terminal capabilities were important to me. 
The terminal is installed by default, so that's one mark in
Nokia's favor. Also, there's a somewhat hidden shortcut of Ctrl-Shift-x
that launches a terminal automatically. Granted, it's a bit
tough to press that keyboard combo, but the fact that one exists at all
shows that this environment doesn't ignore people who like to get their
hands dirty on the command line.
</p><p>
As you start to use the terminal, you'll notice that many of the
common keys you might like to type in a terminal are not on the hardware
keyboard. For instance, to get |, &lt; or &gt;, you have to press a special
function key to bring up a list of special characters. The terminal
does provide a shortcut bar along the bottom of the window with some
common keys, so you can tap those on the touchscreen, but I just
couldn't believe that | was left out. As with most things on the N900,
you can tweak this shortcut bar. All of the settings for the terminal
and many other applications are in gconf, so to add a pipe, I just needed
to run two commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
gconftool-2 --set --type list --list-type=string 
 &#8618;/apps/osso/xterm/keys '[Tab,Escape,Page_Up,Page_Down,bar]'
gconftool-2 --set --type list --list-type=string 
 &#8618;/apps/osso/xterm/key_labels '[Tab,Esc,PgUp,PgDn,|]'
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to switch out or add other keys, it's just a matter of
changing those two gconf entries.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10739f4.large.jpg"><img src="10739f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Default Terminal with Font and Shortcut Bar Tweaks
</p></div></div><p>
By default, the N900 terminal uses a BusyBox shell and vi, but if you
want bash and vim, they are only an apt-get away. After the initial
tweaks, I've been pretty satisfied with the terminal. I can
<tt  >ssh</tt> easily
into a remote server and run mutt and connect to my irssi screen session.
If you do this though, you'll find yourself looking for the missing Alt key
to switch between irssi windows. It turns out that Esc works like Alt in
standard terminals, so to switch to window 2 in irssi, just press
Esc 2. In fact, that should work in your regular desktop terminal as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x154d128"></a>
Other Default Applications</h2></div></div><p>
The N900 comes with quite a few applications out of the box, and although
I don't cover them all here, a few are worth mentioning. 
One of the most important of these is probably the package manager. This program
acts much like any other graphical package manager you might be used
to on Linux. Maemo packages everything in debs and provides its own
APT repositories. In fact, if you are comfortable with apt-get, you
can install the same programs via the command line. You also can add
additional repositories, including ones you've made yourself if you want,
but out of the box, you have access to Nokia's own repositories along
with the stable maemo.org repository.
</p><p>
Maemo.org is the central site that organizes the Open Source community
behind Maemo and is loaded with documentation, news and the main
community forum. Many of the most popular applications from prior
versions of Maemo have been ported to the N900, although you might not
see them all out of the box. Although the main maemo.org repository is on
by default, only applications that have been throughly tested show up
there. If you are willing to risk some instability, you can add Testing
and Devel repositories that somewhat mirror the Debian testing and
unstable system. Applications that are shown to be stable in Devel move
up to Testing and eventually are promoted to the main stable maemo.org
repository.
</p><p>
The N900 also includes a media player, photo management, calendar
and e-mail program. None of these applications stand
out, but they all seem to do an adequate job. The media player can
take advantage of hardware acceleration, and with the right third-party
packages, you can get support for most media formats you'd want to
play. Although the calendar application can't natively sync to Google
Calendar, you can somewhat work around that with its native Exchange
sync feature, even though you still can sync only your first Google
Calendar. The good news is that most of the limitations you might find in
these default programs can be solved with third-party software available
from the maemo.org repositories.
</p><p>
GPS navigation is the one main exception to being able to solve
application shortcomings with third-party programs. I found the Ovi
Maps application included by default to be a bit sluggish and
unintuitive and overall wasn't too impressed. Unfortunately, although
a few other third-party GPS programs are available for the N900,
none available at the time of this writing seem to be able
to provide a better set of features than the default.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x154d338"></a>
Interesting Third-Party Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Maemo's software selection may not have the numbers that Android
or the iPhone have yet, however, in the short time that the N900 has been
available, quite a large number of useful programs are already in the
repositories. Also, the Maemo platform provides you with more options as
a developer, and you can write programs in C, C++, Python or even bash and
with either the GTK or Qt graphics toolkits. The maemo.org repositories
are where the most interesting and useful applications are, and it's where
the N900 really shows some of its strengths as a platform.
Here are a few third-party apps I've personally
found useful:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
OpenVPN: open-source VPN to tunnel into my home network from anywhere.
</p></li><li><p>
gPodder: excellent podcast program.
</p></li><li><p>
BlueMaemo: turns the N900 into a Bluetooth keyboard, mouse and gaming pad.
</p></li><li><p>
VNC and rdesktop: connect to and control remote desktop sessions.
</p></li><li><p>
fbreader: great ebook reader with Project Gutenberg integration.
</p></li><li><p>
DrNokSnes, iNES and SDLMAME: SNES, NES and MAME emulators.
</p></li><li><p>
qtirreco: uses the IR port to turn the N900 into a universal remote.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Duke Nukem</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
III</em></span>: enough said.
</p></li><li><p>
Panucci: media player optimized for podcasts and audio books.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Beyond these programs, many interesting small packages 
extend the functionality of the N900, whether it's adding extra IM protocol
support, remote control via wiimote or applications like MPlayer, nmap
or even AbiWord. In fact, one of the most interesting programs is 
easy-deb-chroot. It sets up a complete Debian ARM chroot image on your
filesystem and gives you access to a regular Debian ARM install. This
means that even though GIMP, for instance, hasn't been ported to Maemo
yet, it, OpenOffice.org, Konqueror, Wireshark and just about any other app
from the Debian ARM repositories are available on the N900 and can run
from within the chroot environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x154dc28"></a>
Day-to-Day Use</h2></div></div><p>
So after all this, what is it like to use the N900 every day as a portable
computer? No matter what, a laptop with a faster processor, bigger screen,
more RAM and larger keyboard probably is going to be nicer and easier
to use than any portable counterpart. Of course, the majority of the
things I use a computer for don't really <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> a large
screen, fast processor or full keyboard. Ultimately, I'm talking about
trade-offs and whether the limitations in the N900's size and hardware
are made up by its features and portability.
</p><p>
The first thing you have to keep in mind is that even though hardware
acceleration takes care of some things, CPU-intensive programs still
are going to perform as though they are on a 600MHz processor. The N900 still
handles multitasking in this circumstance better than other devices I've
seen, but when the CPU is hammered (like when I update my podcasts or
applications), GUI transitions stutter, and sometimes it takes a
second or two to switch programs.
</p><p>
The browser itself works well, so if you spend a majority of your time
on the Web, you'll probably find the N900 does a good job. The display
still is a 3.5" 800x480 screen, so even though it's crisp and bright,
it's not as nice as a 12" or 15" laptop display. Because each program
shows up maximized and it's easy to switch between open windows, this is a
manageable problem, but if you squint on smaller screens, you might want to
check out an N900 in person first to make sure you can see the screen fine.
</p><p>
The keyboard is not too bad, but it does take some getting used to. I would
have liked another row of keys, but honestly, when you are thumb typing, no
matter how things are arranged, you aren't going to hit your touch-typing
speeds. I can chat at decent speeds, and it works fine for other short-term
typing, but I'm not going to write full articles on the N900 without a
Bluetooth keyboard. Also, because you have to press Fn key combos to get to
most symbols, working with vim or programming is a good deal slower.
</p><p>
In many ways, the N900
is like a laptop in that its battery life can vary widely depending
on how you set it and what you do with it. If I
take basic common-sense steps for power management, such as adjusting
the brightness and turning off any vibration or sound notifications I
don't want, I can get a full day's moderate use out of the N900
on a charge. That includes listening to a few hours' worth of podcasts,
browsing the Web on and off, playing some games, connecting
to a remote screen session over SSH and chatting with irssi, and other
regular use. Obviously, if I play a lot of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake III</em></span> or do other tasks
that peg the CPU or network for long periods, the battery takes a
hit. As long as a portable device can last through the day
with normal use, so I can charge it at night when I'm asleep, that's good
enough for me.
</p><p>
One warning about battery life though. I've noticed that some IM plugins
can have a dramatic effect on battery life. Also, one reason that
some software is in the Testing or Devel repositories is that they
haven't been optimized for the N900 yet and might cause significant
drain on your battery.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x105b580.0x154df98"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
So, does the N900 live up to my expectations? Before
this device, I took my laptop to and from work every day, and it was
with me wherever I went&mdash;especially if I was on call. Since I've been
evaluating the N900, my laptop has stayed at home so far unless I'm
giving a presentation. Even when I'm on call, I've found between the
VPN support, SSH, VNC and rdesktop, I can manage all of my servers
from anywhere. Even when I'm at home, half the time I just
want to do basic tasks like browse the Web, check e-mail and chat, so I
don't bother to open my laptop&mdash;I just use the N900. When I telecommute
or write an article, the laptop is more comfortable, but I've found
I use it much less otherwise. I also should note that when the time came
to send back the review unit, I bought an N900 of my own. Having a real
Linux computer in my pocket with always-on Internet access was just too
hard to pass up.
