The Internet is down. Or, is it? Read more to find out how to know for
sure.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2148580.0x2240408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This column is the third in a series dedicated to one of my favorite
subjects: troubleshooting. Because my column generally is aimed more at tips and
tricks and less on philosophy and design, I don't talk much about
overall approaches to problem solving. Instead, in this series, I
describe some general classes of problems you might find on a Linux system, and
then I discuss how to use common tools, most of which are probably already
on your system, to isolate and resolve each class of problem.
</p><p>
In my previous column, I introduced some ways to troubleshoot network problems
on your local network. Many network problems extend past your local network and
either onto other local subnets or onto the Internet itself. In this column,
I provide you with the tools and techniques for answering that
immortal question: is the Internet down, or is it just me?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2148580.0x2240618"></a>
The Internet Is Down</h2></div></div><p>
The scenario I use here to test troubleshooting skills is one that 
everyone has run into at one point or another&mdash;you try to load a Web site, perhaps
even a reliable site like Google, and it won't come up. Because I covered
local network troubleshooting in my last column, I'm assuming you 
already have gone through those steps and are ready to proceed past the local
network. Even though this example deals with testing access to the
Internet, you can use the same steps to troubleshoot problems accessing any
remote network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2148580.0x2240778"></a>
Test Your Gateway</h2></div></div><p>
For your computer to communicate with any other computer outside your local
network, you must have a gateway (router) configured on your local network, and
you must be able to reach it. Without getting into heavy-duty network theory, a
router connects two or more networks and knows how to route packets between
those networks. Your Linux computer has a list of all of the routers it knows
about for each network of which it is a member and when it should use those routers
all stored in its routing table. You can use the route command
to show your computer's current routing table:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ route -n
Kernel IP routing table
Destination  Gateway   Genmask         Flags Metric Ref  Use Iface
10.1.1.0     *          255.255.255.0   U     0      0     0 eth0
default      10.1.1.1  0.0.0.0          UG    100    0     0 eth0
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, I have one gateway defined: 10.1.1.1. It is listed as my
default gateway, which is the router it will use whenever it doesn't have any
other routers defined for that network. In my case, it's also the only router in
my routing table. That means any time my machine wants to communicate with
a remote network (in my example, anything that's not within
10.1.1.0/255.255.255.0 or 10.1.1.1&ndash;10.1.1.254), it's going to send the packet
to 10.1.1.1 to forward on.
</p><p>
So now that I know my default gateway, I use ping to test whether it's
available:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ping -c 5 10.1.1.1
PING 10.1.1.1 (10.1.1.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=3.13 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.43 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=1.79 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.1: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=1.50 ms

--- 10.1.1.1 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 4 received, 20% packet loss, time 4020ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 1.436/1.966/3.132/0.686 ms
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, four out of five ping packets were received, so I can be reasonably
sure my gateway works. If I couldn't ping the gateway, either my network
admin is blocking ICMP packets (I hate when people do that), my switch port is
set to the wrong VLAN, or my gateway is truly down. If the gateway is down,
fixing the problem might mean rebooting your DSL or wireless router (if that's
how you connect to the Internet) or moving your troubleshooting to whatever
device is acting as your gateway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2148580.0x2240ae8"></a>
Test DNS</h2></div></div><p>
In my case, I was able to ping the gateway, so I'm ready to move on to DNS.
Because
most of us don't browse the Web by IP address, we need DNS to resolve the
hostnames we type into IP addresses. If DNS isn't working correctly, even if we
technically can reach that remote IP address, we never will know what the IP
address is.
</p><p>
A basic way to test DNS is via the nslookup command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nslookup www.linuxjournal.com
Server:	 10.2.2.2
Address:	10.2.2.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	www.linuxjournal.com
Address: 76.74.252.198
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, DNS is functioning correctly as far as I can tell. I say as
far as I can tell, because I'm assuming that 76.74.252.198 is the correct IP
address for www.linuxjournal.com. If it were the wrong address, that very
well could be the cause of the problem! The DNS server in this case is
10.2.2.2, but
in some environments, it could be the same IP address as your gateway.
</p><p>
Even though the DNS server worked, because I want to show how to troubleshoot
DNS,
I need some examples of how it can fail. To illustrate this, let me show a few
different nslookup commands that have failed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nslookup www.linuxjournal.com
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
</pre>
</p><p>
This error tells me that nslookup couldn't communicate with my DNS server.
That
could be because either I don't have any name servers configured on my system
or I just can't reach them. To see whether I have any name servers configured,
I would check my /etc/resolv.conf file. This file keeps track of what name
servers I should use. In my case, it would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
search example.net
nameserver 10.2.2.2
</pre>
</p><p>
If your resolv.conf file doesn't have a name server entry, you have found
the problem. You need to add the IP address of your name server here. Because I
do have a name server defined in resolv.conf, the next step is to attempt to
ping the name server's IP with the same ping command that I used for the
gateway above. If you can't ping the name server, either a firewall is
blocking ICMP (those pesky network administrators!) or there's a routing
problem between you and the name server. To rule out the latter, use a
tool called traceroute. Traceroute tests the route between you and a remote
IP address. To use it, type <tt  >traceroute</tt> followed by the IP address you want to
reach. In my case, I would use 10.2.2.2:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ traceroute 10.2.2.2
traceroute to 10.2.2.2 (10.2.2.2), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
1  10.1.1.1 (10.1.1.1)  5.432 ms  5.206 ms  5.472 ms
2  10.2.2.2 (10.2.2.2)  8.039 ms  8.348 ms  8.643 ms
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I can route to 10.2.2.2 successfully. To get there, my packets
first go to 10.1.1.1 and then move straight to 10.2.2.2. This tells me that
10.1.1.1 is likely the gateway for both networks. If there are more routers
between you and your remote server, you will have more hops in between. On the
other hand, if you do have a routing problem, your output might look more like
the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ traceroute 10.2.2.2
traceroute to 10.2.2.2 (10.2.2.2), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
1  10.1.1.1 (10.1.1.1)  5.432 ms  5.206 ms  5.472 ms
2  * * *
3  * * *
</pre>
</p><p>
If you start seeing asterisks in the output, you know the problem likely
begins on the last router on the list, so you would need to start
troubleshooting from that router. Instead, you might see output like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ traceroute 10.1.2.5
traceroute to 10.1.2.5 (10.1.2.5), 30 hops max, 40 byte packets
1  10.1.1.1 (10.1.1.1)  5.432 ms  5.206 ms  5.472 ms
1  10.1.1.1 (10.1.1.1)  3006.477 ms !H  3006.779 ms !H  3007.072 ms
</pre>
</p><p>
This means your ping timed out at the gateway, so the remote host could be
down, unplugged or otherwise inaccessible, so you would need to troubleshoot its
connection to the network.
</p><p>
Note: traceroute relies on ICMP, so if ICMP is blocked on your network, install a
tool called tcptraceroute to perform a similar test over TCP (the syntax is the
same, you just type <tt  >tcptraceroute</tt> instead of
<tt  >traceroute</tt>).
</p><p>
If you can ping the name server but it isn't responding to you, go
back to my previous column and perform all the troubleshooting steps to test
whether the remote port is open and accessible on the remote host. Keep in
mind though that DNS servers use port 53 on TCP and UDP. Again, if you aren't
sure what port a service uses, check the /etc/services file on your system. It
lists most of the common services you will use.

Other Name Server Problems</h2></div></div><p>
Another common nslookup error you might run into is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ nslookup web1
Server:      10.2.2.2
Address:     10.2.2.2#53

** server can't find web1: NXDOMAIN
</pre>
</p><p>
Here my name server at 10.2.2.2 responded to me but told me it couldn't find
the record for server web1. This error could mean that I don't have web1's
proper domain name in my DNS search path. If you don't specify a host's fully
qualified domain name (for instance, web1.mysite.com) but instead use the
shorthand form of the hostname, your system will check /etc/resolv.conf for
domains in your DNS search path. It then will add those domains one by one to
the end of your hostname to see if it resolves. The DNS search path is the line
in /etc/resolv.conf that starts with the word <tt  >search</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
search example.net example2.net
nameserver 10.2.2.2
</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, when I search for web1's IP address, my system will first search for
web1.example.net, and if that has no records, it will search for
web1.example2.net. If you want to test whether this is the problem, simply run
nslookup again but with the fully qualified domain name (such as
web1.mysite.com). If it resolves, either make sure you always use the fully
qualified domain name when you access that server, or add that domain to the
search path in /etc/resolv.conf.
</p><p>
If you try nslookup against the fully qualified domain name and you still get
the same NXDOMAIN error above, your problem is with the name server
itself.
Troubleshooting the full range of DNS server problems is a bit beyond what I
could reasonably fit in this column, but here are a few steps to get you
started. If you know your DNS server is configured to have the record you
are looking for itself, you need to examine its zone records to make
sure that particular hostname exists. If, on the other hand, you are searching
for a domain for which you know it doesn't have a record (say,
www.linuxjournal.com),
it's possible your DNS server isn't allowing recursive queries from your
host or at all. You can test that by trying to resolve some other remote host
on the Internet. If it doesn't resolve, it's probably a recursion setting.
If it does resolve, the problem might very well be with that remote site's
DNS server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2148580.0x2241748"></a>
Test General Internet Routing</h2></div></div><p>
If after all these tests you find that your DNS servers are working fine, but
you still can't access the remote server, the final step is to perform another
traceroute like above, only directly against the remote server. So for
instance, if you wanted to test your route to www.linuxjournal.com, the traceroute
might look like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ traceroute www.linuxjournal.com
traceroute to www.linuxjournal.com (76.74.252.198), 30 hops max, 
 &#8618;60 byte packets

</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I'm 15 hops (or routers) away from the www.linuxjournal.com
server. This is an example of a successful query, but if you ran the same query
and noticed a number of rows of asterisks that never made it to your
destination <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> you couldn't ping www.linuxjournal.com
directly, the problem could be an Internet routing issue between you and the
remote network. Unfortunately, it's probably something outside your control,
but fortunately, these sorts of problems tend to resolve themselves pretty
quickly, so just keep trying.
</p><p>
If, on the other hand, your traceroute command was successful, but the remote site
still didn't work, go back to the steps I discussed in my previous column on
how to use telnet and nmap to test whether a remote port is open. It 
actually could be that the remote server is down (hey, it happens to the best
of us) or that someone has configured a firewall to block you from that remote server.
</p><p>
I hope this series has kindled (or rekindled) your interest in
troubleshooting under Linux. One of the things I love about Linux is how little
it hides from you about how it works and how many troubleshooting tools it
provides when things do go wrong. If this has piqued your interest, there
are many more troubleshooting avenues for you to explore&mdash;from DNS servers like
I mentioned above, to troubleshooting just about any type of service. Also, if
you have any other great tools or techniques you use to track down these
problems, drop me a line. I'm always on the lookout for tools to solve problems
faster.
