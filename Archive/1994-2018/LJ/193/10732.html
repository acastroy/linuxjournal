There are so many choices of music players for Linux, it's hard to know which one
will work best for you. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10cf580.0x11c73b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
On modern computers, music players are as standard as word processors
and spreadsheets, but how do you choose one?
You can take for granted that music players using the same soundcard and speakers will produce roughly the same quality of sound. You
also can assume that any music player you try will be able to play
any music format that your operating system supports, including, for
GNU/Linux, the free Ogg Vorbis format. A modern music player will 
support various sources as well, ranging from the local collection of tracks on
your hard drive to CDs, DVDs, external players and on-line sources, such
as Internet radio and podcasts. So, how do you decide?
</p><p>
To suggest an answer, I looked at five of the most popular music
players for GNOME and KDE&mdash;Amarok, Banshee, Exaile, Rhythmbox and
Songbird&mdash;using the current versions available in the Debian unstable
repository. After comparing them in each of six general usability categories, I ranked them and tallied the results.

Interface and Usability</h2></div></div><p>
Dragging and dropping tracks, desktop notifications and minimizing
music players to the notification tray are all standard features these
days. The differences in how each music player handles those features
are usually minor, although Amarok, like most current KDE apps, provides
the most customization for notifications. It also repurposes its middle
context pane when you are moving tracks from the media source pane on
the left to the playlist on the right by temporarily transforming it
into live links that you can drop selections on to get different results.
</p><p>
However, the largest problem for all these music players is how they
handle collections of local tracks and podcasts and music stores that 
easily can number in the thousands these days. Unfortunately, in four out of
five cases, the handling of all this information is not well thought out.
</p><p>
The endless displays of tracks, albums, artists and playlists not only
make for a cluttered window, but also can leave users with a feeling that
they have too much information. At times, what controls actually do can
be difficult to discover, as with the filters for Rhythmbox's search
filter, which easily can be mistaken as controls for altering the panes
displayed in the window. Too often, the space for each column in a pane
is so limited and track or album names are so truncated in anything
less than a full-screen view, they almost might not be listed at all.
</p><p>
The exception to this rule is Amarok, whose three main panes maximize the
display space in the window while using every sort of trick&mdash;from expanded
trees to hiding music sources not currently in use&mdash;to reduce the clutter
and information overload. Exaile and Songbird manage some of the clutter
in their default views with tabs, but Banshee and Rhythmbox both have a
series of permanent panes that feel badly in need of cleanup. You can,
of course, greatly improve the layout of all the music players via the
View menu by selecting which panes or columns to display, but Amarok
remains far ahead in general appearance. If you really want to remove the
clutter, you can hide the middle context pane, reducing the information
in Amarok to a functional minimum. Another possibility is to undock one
or more of Amarok's panes to create a separate floating window that you
can refer to only as needed.
</p><p>
Still, all five players do what they can to help users navigate. All
can sort lists in ascending and descending order, and all include search
filters, although Amarok gives you more control over both sorting and
filters. In addition, Amarok and Banshee both offer bookmarks.
</p><p>
After Amarok, the best-designed is Songbird, whose Web structure gives it
an instant familiarity. Songbird also features skins, called feathers,
and a zoom for changing the size at which information is displayed,
but these features, although novel and convenient, are not enough to
challenge Amarok seriously.

Editing Metatags</h2></div></div><p>
The metatags for tracks are essential to any music player, not only for
display, but also for automating various features, such as CD ripping
and suggesting music similar to the current track.
</p><p>
In all five music players, tags are lumped into statistics about how often
each track is played, how the track is rated and background
information, such as lyrics and cover art. Yet, despite the importance
of tags, Rhythmbox and Exaile do not include a general Comment tag for
miscellaneous information, and only Exaile and Amarok have any provision
for custom tagging (and you easily can miss the Add button in Exaile).
</p><p>
An even larger omission is the fact that you can edit tags only by
albums in Amarok. The reason may be that Amarok is designed to play
music equally by track or album, while the other players are oriented
toward tracks. Yet, even so, editing tags under albums means that you
have to enter them only once instead of ten or more times.
</p><p>
Another useful feature for handling tags in Amarok is to guess them
from the filenames. If you have ripped music from a source like K3B,
which names files according to sequences of tags, this feature can
eliminate drudgery even further. The feature is not always accurate, however,
and it can cause trouble when illegal characters are used in a filename,
yet, even so, anyone digitalizing masses of music will find it essential.

Automating Playlists</h2></div></div><p>
With all five players, you can randomize the order in which the tracks
on a playlist are played. However, with Rhythmbox, that is as far as
automation goes.
</p><p>
Banshee, Exaile and Songbird all have controls to create automated
playlists based on criteria, such as the most played or the least
played. In Banshee, two unique playlist controls are Recently Added and
Unheard, while Songbird includes Artists on Tour, which selects from
artists who are touring soon in your area. By contrast, Exaile's playlist controls are less
useful unless you are planning for a party, as they include Top 100,
Newest 100 and Random 100 and 500&mdash;a selection that sounds like an
effort to re-create the Top 40 radio that many people originally turned
to music players to escape.
</p><p>
Exaile is more to the point with its Smart Playlists, in which you
can specify the criteria for automated playlists. This feature is
duplicated almost exactly in Songbird, but in my experience, it works only
erratically in either Exaile or Songbird.
</p><p>
However, the most sophisticated automated playlists are found in
Amarok. Amarok's Dynamic Playlists include three types of bias:
Proportional Bias, in which playlists are forced to include set
percentages of tracks that match the designated tags; Custom Bias, in
which playlists include set percentages to match the tags; and Fuzzy
Bias, which sets how much tags can vary from the tags specified. You
can mix all of these biases to create playlists that match or
exceed those in the other four players, and best of all, new lists are
created with almost no delay when you click the Repopulate button.

Context and Background</h2></div></div><p>
One disadvantage of digitalized music is that it lacks the background
information you can get with a CD in the form of liner notes. Some
tracks and albums use context tags to give information about producers and
backup music, but this practice is relatively rare, and the information
is not nearly as rich as with traditional media. Even the latest version
of Amarok, in which you can add custom tags, you can't really re-create
the information that comes with CDs via tags.
</p><p>
Instead, music players are starting to provide alternatives to liner
notes using resources from the Internet. All five players can hunt
the Internet for lyrics and covers, although with Rhythmbox, doing so 
requires enabling plugins. Exaile and Amarok also search for Artists and
Albums, while Banshee bizarrely opts for a context pane that includes
Top Albums and Top Tracks by the current artist&mdash;information that is
minimally useful and more than a little imaginary the first few times you
play tracks. However, taking a hard-core fan approach, Songbird outdoes
the rest by searching for reviews, news, photos and videos.
</p><p>
The success of these efforts to provide extra context depends partly
on the artist and album. In every case, the effort is more likely to be
successful if artists are popular or at least have a cult following
that increases their chances of being listed in Wikipedia or on fan
sites. Disambiguation pages also can be a problem.
</p><p>
Even more important, searches can be long and may end with no
results. Searches in Songbird for reviews and news often take longer than
a single song, while in Amarok a long lyric search can freeze the track
controls, although the track keeps playing. However, on the plus side,
context features sometimes can produce unexpected benefits for the true
fan, such as alternate record covers or (as I once found for The
Pogues' &ldquo;Fairytale in New York&rdquo;) unrecorded versions of the lyrics.

Scripts and Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
In free software, music players are second only to Firefox and
OpenOffice.org in their efforts to extend functionality by creating a
community of plugin writers. With each player, many of these plugins
automate specific Internet sources. Other plugins alter the interface
or add features.
</p><p>
Rhythmbox provides no means for easily browsing or installing new
plugins. Because the functionality provided often is standard on the
other players (such as finding cover art), the impression is either
that few people are writing plugins for Rhythmbox or that the
project conceives plugins as a way of providing a smaller standard code
base. Banshee similarly has a limited number of plugins, including some
that could be standard features, although it does distinguish itself with
extensions for creating bookmarks and detecting BPM (beats per minute).
</p><p>
By contrast, the other three players have a much richer ecosystem of
plugins. Songbird distinguishes itself by add-ons for creating a mash
tape or for learning about upcoming local concerts. Amarok's plugins
are focused largely on providing alternative sources for lyrics and
for automated logon to Internet sources, many of them (such as those
for CBC radio or on-line readings of the Koran) obviously intended for
specific local audiences. Only a few of Amarok's scripts, such as the
script for copying the current song information into the clipboard, are
intended to extend functionality, perhaps in part because the Amarok 2.x
series of releases is relatively new, and at least until recently,
developers were busy providing basic functionality that users missed
from the 1.x series of releases.
</p><p>
The most varied set of plugins for functionality is found in Exaile. For
example, you can add plugins to display cover art with an album or on
the desktop, set an alarm, enable support for Metacity hot keys in GNOME,
reduce the window to a minimal size and many other possibilities. Among
this variety, Exaile's lack of a control for adding new plugins seems
a strange oversight.

Additional Features and Customization</h2></div></div><p>
All five players have features that do not fit neatly into other
categories. Rhythmbox's are modest: a minimal window and a full-screen
mode, and visualization&mdash;a random pattern that displays while music
is playing. Banshee's are almost as modest, with options for how files
and the local music collection are handled.
</p><p>
With Exaile, the other features start to get more interesting. Exaile
includes a blacklist manager, so you can exclude tracks that you prefer
not to hear but are not ready to delete, as well as commands within the
context menu to burn selections to CD/DVD.
</p><p>
In comparison, Amarok's extras are largely practical. They include the
ability to reposition notifications (which can come in handy if they
block your set of icons) and the ability to edit database settings. An
especially useful feature is the storage of passwords to sites in KDE
Wallet to keep them secure while making them easily accessible. However,
if you do not use on-line sites often, you may find logging in to KDE
Wallet each time you start Amarok irksome.
</p><p>
In keeping with its Web origins, Songbird has a strong emphasis on
privacy and security. It has Firefox-like controls for ensuring privacy,
including a Clear Private Data feature. Also like Firefox, it can store
passwords for sites and use a master password to save you the effort of
remembering the other ones. Songbird preferences also include a page in
which you can choose what information you want to share with sites that
you log in to. Still another sign of its Web orientation is a tab in the
preferences for setting up how you use iTunes.
</p><p>

Choosing a Music Player</h2></div></div><p>
I awarded one point for a first-place finish, two for a second-place
finish and so on, which means a low score is better. Tallying the
results, Amarok gets first place with 8 points, with Exaile and
Songbird tied for second, with 15 points apiece. They were
followed by Banshee with 20 and Rhythmbox with 26.
</p><p>
These results don't tell the whole story. For instance, many uses will
reject Banshee automatically because it depends on Mono.
Others might prefer Banshee because it is GNOME-based
or Rhythmbox because it includes a minimal feature set.
</p><p>
Just as important, I could have included at least five
more players. When you consider Audacious, Listen, Quod Libet and
Sonata, you realize just how broad the selection of free music players
is. However, I selected these either because they are the default
players with most distributions or because they have a substantial cult
following. For better or worse, they are the most popular music players
on the free desktop at the time of this writing. 
</p><p>
However, even if you do not take the ranking as absolute, the reasons
behind the rankings may help you decide which player is right for you. This
exercise also suggests something about the current state of music
players, with Amarok well in the lead and Rhythmbox fading, and the
others sometimes sporting innovative features but failing to mount a
general challenge to Amarok's dominance in the field.
