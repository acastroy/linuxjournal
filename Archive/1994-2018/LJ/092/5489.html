    With Linux moving to the desktop, life gets more complicated for system administrators.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1336580.0x142e608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Until now, system administrators running
Linux have had it fairly easy. But this won't last long. Why? Well,
until now Linux has been basically a server OS. The GUI, and
therefore window manager, was just a pretty option. But as Linux
moves to the desktop, the Linux system administrator's life becomes
much more complicated. Now, it's not just a matter of knowing how
to configure sendmail, DNS and Apache, but being able to fix GUIs
users have managed to break somehow. That means knowing, inside and
out, KDE, GNOME, XFCE, TWM, FVWM, MWM, Blackbox, etc. Sure, your
present company may dictate KDE and enforce the choice. But another
company will push GNOME or any of a dozen other WMs. Then there's
the rogue &ldquo;power user&rdquo; who knows enough to be dangerous and has
installed a private copy of his or her favorite WM. I've looked at
the KDE configuration files and I'm awed. My /opt/kde/share/config
has more files than /etc. Guess I'll be figuring them out for a
while. Then it's on to GNOME. Yes, I know there are GUI config
tools for all this. And that's all well and fine when you're
standing in front of the system. But when the broken system is on
the other end of a 56k dial-up connection, vi is still my tool of
choice.
</p><p>vcheck:
<a href="http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/~gomar/stuff/vcheck" target="_self">www.tu-ilmenau.de/~gomar/stuff/vcheck</a></p><p>If you must maintain a system with the latest and greatest
that's out, then vcheck can be a lifesaver. I don't know of any
distribution that will keep libraries and other files up to date
except for security reasons. I find that my libraries must be the
most current for new software to build. This utility makes it easy.
The default configuration will check on your kernel, but adding
entries is easy. A quick cron job and you always have the latest
software ready for installation. Requires: Perl and Perl modules:
LWP::UserAgent, Getopt::Long, File::Copy, HTTP::Request and
File::Basename.</p><p>GtkDiskFree:
<a href="http://gtkdiskfree.sourceforge.net" target="_self">gtkdiskfree.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>While I generally prefer the command line to check disk
usage, this particular utility is very nice. What I like about it
is that I can put a copy on all my systems, then use ssh's ability
to run an application remotely and display it locally (if you have
X11 forwarding configured). I can put half a dozen on the screen
and keep an eye on all the systems at once. Requires: libgtk,
libfdk, libgmodule, libdl, libglib, libXext, libX11, libm,
glibc.</p><p>ettercap:
<a href="http://ettercap.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ettercap.sourceforge.net</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ettercap</b></span> goes beyond the
simple (though extremely useful) tcpdump and shows you more about
what's happening on your LAN. It can show all traffic between two
hosts or can show only web traffic, etc. It also can analyze
encrypted traffic and works even on a switched LAN. It can,
however, be a little hard on a LAN on startup as it uses an ARP
storm to gain LAN information in a switched environment. Of course,
there are always command-line options that can be used to override
this behavior. Requires: libdl, libform, libncurses, libm, libssl,
libcrypto, glibc.</p><p>Perltidy:
<a href="http://perltidy.sourceforge.net" target="_self">perltidy.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>I may be wrong (and often am), but I believe most
administrators have at least a little knowledge of Perl. It's just
that Perl is so darn useful and simple it's relatively easy to
write in. And combined with a lot of powerful modules, so much can
be done by those of us with little real programming knowledge. The
Perltidy application can help you by making your Perl code a little
easier to read. I personally don't always indent. And between
writing sessions (write/test/rewrite) I find I occasionally do
things differently. Perltidy attempts to clean up all that and
more. It's not perfect, but it does make your code more readable.
Requires: Perl and the Perl module IO::File.</p><p>gocr:
<a href="ftp://jocr.sourceforge.net" target="_self">jocr.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>The gocr program is an attempt to bring optical character
recognition (OCR) capabilities to Linux. This program is designed
to work with PNG files (faxes) to turn them into ASCII text. I
tried a number of different documents and found that, while gocr
does work, it is fairly sensitive to the font size and type used.
If someone sends you a very fancy fax with italics and fonts in
differing sizes, gocr probably won't help much. But a very plain
fax using a courier font comes through fairly well. As usual, your
mileage may vary. Requires: libpnm, libpgm, libppm, glibc.</p><p>ipband:
<a href="http://ipband.sourceforge.net" target="_self">ipband.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>This utility will show you bandwidth utilization on your
network. Yes, you can use MRTG, but if you don't want to run SNMP
and a web server, this will do you well. Most administrators need
something to help justify increases in bandwidth or capacity for
your LAN, or just to identify the bandwidth hogs. Requires:
libpcap, glibc.</p><p>GtkLP:
<a href="http://www.stud.uni-hannover.de/~sirtobi/gtklp" target="_self">www.stud.uni-hannover.de/~sirtobi/gtklp</a></p><p>If you're running CUPS as your printer software, you might
want to look at GtkLP for use in the X Window System. While CUPS
comes with a web interface, it's not the quickest way around the
CUPS system. GtkLP will get you around much more quickly. The
utility is easy to use and allows you to do a number of things much
more easily than with CUPS' web interface. Worth a look. Requires:
libcups, libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libm, libssl, libcrypto, glibc.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
