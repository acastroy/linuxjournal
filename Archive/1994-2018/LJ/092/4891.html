    Tailoring math-intensive documents to fit the Internet.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf4e580.0x10464a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ironically, 20 years after the advent of
the World Wide Web, it is still a struggle to publish
math-intensive scientific documents on the Web. New standards like
MathML have been out, but before the popular web browsers support
them, the best way to reach a maximum audience is still to put math
formulae as in-line graphics in HTML documents.
</p><p>In the off-line world, TeX/LaTeX packages are known to
produce the best formatted scientific documents. LaTeX is, in fact,
a standard format for many academic journals. For scientists and
researchers, the best of two worlds is to write in LaTeX and then
publish on the Web. LaTeX2HTML is the perfect tool for that.</p><p>LaTeX2HTML originally was written by Nikos Drakos in 1993 as
an open-source project. It was improved and enhanced by many
members of the Open Source community. LaTeX2HTML converts LaTeX
documents to standard HTML format. Since HTML is a text format, it
converts all the nontext elements into in-line graphics. It is a
Perl application and runs on many platforms including most flavors
of UNIX/Linux and Windows.</p><p>In this article, I first give an example of how to convert a
simple LaTeX document to HTML and discuss how the program handles
in-line graphics and style files. I then explain the
LaTeX2HTML-specific LaTeX commands/environments. Finally, I discuss
a more creative use of LaTeX2HTML&mdash;using it on the server side. For
simplicity, the term formula refers to anything that is in LaTeX's
math mode. That includes simple in-text math symbols,
&ldquo;displaymath&rdquo; formulae and numbered equations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf4e580.0x10466b8"></a>A Simple Example</h2></div></div><p>The usage of the command is very straightforward. If you want
to publish your LaTeX document, mydoc.tex, to the Web, you
run</p><pre     class="programlisting">
latex2html -local_icons mydoc.tex
</pre><p>LaTeX2HTML creates a new subdirectory (mydoc/) and puts all
HTML files and image files in it. You can now copy mydoc/ under the
document tree of your web server, and your document is available at
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourserver</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span>/mydoc/index.html.
</p><p>The title, headings and emphasized text are marked up
properly with HTML tags. All the formulae/tables/figures and
anything that normal HTML cannot display are converted into in-line
graphics.</p><p>If mydoc.tex has several sections/subsections, LaTeX2HTML
generates an HTML file for each section and a table of contents
with links to each section. Each page has a navigation bar with
links to next/prev sections and the table of contents. If you want
only one big HTML file, use the <b  >-split 0</b>
command-line switch.</p><p>LaTeX2HTML needs to know where to find the icon images on the
navigation bar. The simplest solution is to use the -local_icons
command-line switch, which instructs LaTeX2HTML to copy the
navigation icons into the directory mydoc/. You also can use custom
navigation icons by replacing mydoc/*motif*.gif files with your
own.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf4e580.0x1046a80"></a>In-Line Graphics</h2></div></div><p>I use math formulae as an example to explain how LaTeX2HTML
handles in-line graphics. It does the same thing for floating
objects such as figures and tables.</p><p>LaTeX2HTML scans through mydoc.tex and extracts all math
formulae into a file called images.tex. In images.tex, each formula
is on a separate page. It then calls <b  >latex
images.tex</b> and <b  >dvips -S 1 -i</b> to
generate a one-page PostScript file for each formula. Ghostscript
is used to convert and resize PostScript files into GIF or PNG
images. LaTeX2HTML will remember the image names and insert the
links back to HTML files generated from mydoc.tex.</p><p>There are several command-line switches to control the image
generation process. For example, switch ps_images instructs
LaTeX2HTML to use links to external PostScript files rather than
in-line graphics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf4e580.0x1046ce8"></a>Style Files</h2></div></div><p>LaTeX2HTML handles style files differently for text and
in-line graphics. LaTeX2HTML ignores any style file when it
generates main text HTML files from mydoc.tex. However, style files
often define new commands and environments that cannot be ignored.
As a workaround, LaTeX2HTML allows users to rewrite the style file
in Perl format. When LaTeX2HTML encounters a style file, it
searches for the Perl translation and incorporates it into the main
script. Fortunately, many popular style files already have been
translated into Perl. To write such translations requires a working
knowledge of the LaTeX2HTML internal structure. It is a difficult
task, but you have the source code.</p><p>We want formulae, figures and tables to look exactly the same
as they would print out on paper, with all the custom symbols,
fonts and spacing. So, images.tex includes all the style files used
by mydoc.tex. Since images.tex is processed by LaTeX, the style
files are handled correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf4e580.0x1046e48"></a>Write for the Web</h2></div></div><p>LaTeX2HTML is powerful in converting existing documents into
web format. LaTeX2HTML offers a set of custom LaTeX commands and
environments that allow you to include your own HTML markups in the
text. You can take full advantage of normal HTML: you can add web
forms, clickable image maps, external links/graphics or even Java
applet/script to your document. For example, if you want to include
a link to an outside web page in your generated HTML pages, you can
just insert the following to mydoc.tex:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\htmladdnormallink{link title}{http://yourlink}
</pre><p>or more generically,
<pre     class="programlisting">
\begin{rawhtml}
&lt;A HREF="http://yourlink"&gt;link title&lt;/a&gt;
\end{rawhtml}
</pre>


If you want to print out a paper version of that HTML-enhanced
document, you can include style file html.sty and then process it
with normal LaTeX. Most of those LaTeX2HTML-specific
commands/environments are ignored by LaTeX.

web-based mathematical communications. Listing 1 demonstrates a
Perl function that takes in a math-mode LaTeX string and returns an
HTML markup for an image that displays the formula. There are other
ways to do it more efficiently, but this is just an illustration of
what LaTeX2HTML can do. It can be used in chat rooms or bulletin
boards to allow the user to input and broadcast complex math
formulae.</p><p><a href="4891l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Perl Function Converting
