<i  >LJ</i>. The new look is great. It even seems the
writing is more professional in these last two issues than it had
been in the past. I initially thought this issue was the best I'd
read! But the October 2001 issue is right up there, if not better!
I had considered dropping my subscription to
<i  >LJ</i> because the articles read too informally. I
don't know if that makes sense. But these last two issues have been
excellent! Keep up the good work.</p><p>&mdash;Matt C.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c13580.0x1d0b3f8"></a>Shorter UPFRONT?</h2></div></div><p>I must say that overall I like the new format of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I am disappointed, however, in
the reduced content of the UPFRONT section. I really enjoyed all
the quotes and odd statistics in the old format of the UPFRONT
section. I hope that the lack of these items in the September 2001
issue is only a temporary condition.</p><p>&mdash;John Metzner</p><p>Not to worry, John&mdash;the amount of UPFRONT content varies
somewhat month to month.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c13580.0x1d0b660"></a>Disallowed Dirty Phrase</h2></div></div><p>I could not resist trying the small driver from the article
&ldquo;Loadable Kernel Module Exploits&rdquo; (<i  >LJ</i>,
September 2001). But there were some problems: 1) there are too
many headers in Listing 1, 2) char * temp_buf is unused, 3)
wrapped_write() should stick whether to &ldquo;n&rdquo; or &ldquo;count&rdquo; as one
of its parameters and 4) wrapped_write I would put as
wrapped_write(int fd, void *buf, size_t n).</p><p>I liked the idea about replacing all &ldquo;Linux sucks&rdquo; phrases
to &ldquo;Linux rules&rdquo;, so I tried to implement it. I extended the
wrapped_write function to do such a replacement. The function
strstr() gave me problems while compiling, and I did not find an
implementation of it on my Mandrake 8.0 laptop. &ldquo;extern strstr&rdquo;
was everywhere. So I used a simple loop with strncmp(), and it
proved to be more useful because it can replace several occurrences
of a phrase. To do so and please the compiler, I removed &ldquo;const&rdquo;
from the wrapped_write() parameters to write back to &ldquo;void *buf&rdquo;.
Also, I had to change the linux/version.h file because I had
compiled the kernel myself, and insmod was swearing at the
difference. But in the end when I had succeeded, I really enjoyed
playing with such a kernel module: whenever I tried to type that
dirty phrase it was immediately replaced. I tried some editors,
sent naughty e-mails to myself and so on...great! Thanks a lot to
the author; now I agree with Linus Torvalds: the real purpose of
Linux is to have fun.</p><p>&mdash;Vladislav Belogroudov</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c13580.0x1d0b870"></a>Agrees with Jones</h2></div></div><p>I would like to express my strong agreement with Daniel D.
Jones, whose letter you published in the October 2001 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. The French chef gag employed in
Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s Cooking with Linux column is irritating and
tiresome. While the content of the column is of some value, I doubt
I'm alone in finding the style annoying and unhelpful.</p><p>&mdash;John Doherty</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c13580.0x1d0ba28"></a>Satisfied Diner</h2></div></div><p>I look forward to my monthly visit to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>. His topics are always interesting, his
explanations have that extreme French lucidity, and I live in hope
that Fran&ccedil;ois will pour me some of that Chambertin 1998.
Perhaps Mr. Jones has a touch of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>mal de mer,

&ldquo;CheapLinux&rdquo;? Living next to a major city like San Francisco in
the state of California, I guess one just starts speaking Spanish
without realizing it. A Spanish name does not imply low quality.
But are you sure you haven't stepped on some legal toes using the
name El Cheapo Linux? Google finds 2,440 pages with El Cheapo
Linux.</p><p>&mdash;Steven M. Ruiz</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rosen replies:</b></span> Mr. Ruiz, I'm
sorry you took offense at my Spanish-sounding name for Linux. I
suppose I could have used the made-up mark &ldquo;Cheap Linux&rdquo; to make
the point that a trademark eventually becomes associated with a
product and conveys many marketing messages based on the meaning of
the words in common parlance as well as the mental associations
created by advertising dollars. I didn't have to go to Spanish for
that point. I used a foreign-sounding mark for another reason,
although I failed to explain the reason in my article. (There is
only so much one can say in about 500 words!) Many people assume
that translating a trademark into a foreign language (or
foreign-sounding language) will help them avoid trademark
infringement claims. The law doesn't work that way. I doubt the US
Trademark Office would allow registration of Manzana computers, or
Linux Sombrero Rojo, or that Apple Computer or Red Hat would stand
idly by while those marks were applied to competing goods. I
suppose I could have chosen more precise Spanish (Linux Barato),
French (Linux Vulgaire) or German (Linux Billig) for my example.
Perhaps then someone else besides you would have taken umbrage, or
I could have escaped without criticism at all. I did a quick Google
search on &ldquo;El Cheapo Linux&rdquo;. Indeed there are many hits. But my
quick scan found none that would qualify as a valid trademark.
(That's a relief!) It appears that, even were a person to seek
trademark registration for that mark, it would be disapproved as
being merely descriptive, or perhaps now, generic. For what it is
worth, I meant no disrespect. I represent a number of
Spanish-speaking clients, I do pro-bono work for nonprofit Hispanic
groups in the Bay Area, and I even lived in Guatemala when I was a
child. So I'm not trying to sound like I'm disparaging your
language (or any language) or the people who speak it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c13580.0x1d0be48"></a>Love the MUD</h2></div></div><p>In the October 2001 issue Marcel turned me on to that
delectable project called ALICE. In his article, he gave notice of
an age old net entertainment called MUDs. I want to thank Marcel in
cooking up such fine recipes in the past, and for adding a bit of
MUD seasoning to his cuisine.</p><p>MUD games and Linux fit together hand in hand. Ask a few of
the local geeks in the office, such as Alan Cox or Illiad, what a
MUD is. Graphical games are greatly enjoyed, but you just can't
beat sitting down and role playing or hacking up your best bud
through a text-based interface. Huzzah Marcel and

stated (on page 44):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Since then, universities like Berkeley and
companies like VA Linux have developed efficient software packages
for cluster monitoring and have made them open source. We use a
node-cloning package called SystemImager from VA Linux

actually created and developed by yours truly, Brian Finley. VA
Linux did release a version of my software, as did SGI, in a
