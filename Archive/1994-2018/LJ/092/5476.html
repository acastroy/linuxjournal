    Making sure your system processes and critical applications log the events and states you're interested in with syslog.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xeee500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Whatever else you do to secure a Linux
system, it must have comprehensive, accurate and carefully watched
logs. Logs serve several purposes. First, they help us troubleshoot
virtually all kinds of system and application problems. Second,
they provide valuable early warning signs of system abuse. And
third, when all else fails (whether that means a system crash or a
system compromise), logs provide us with crucial forensic data.
</p><p>This article is about making sure your system processes and
critical applications log the events and states you're interested
in. The tried-and-true tool for achieving this is syslog.
<span   class="bold"><b>syslog</b></span> accepts log data from the
kernel (by way of klogd), from any and all local processes, and
even from processes on remote systems. It's flexible as well,
allowing you to determine what gets logged and where it gets
logged. A preconfigured syslog installation is part of the base
operating system in virtually all variants of UNIX and
Linux.</p><p>This month, therefore, we discuss syslog configuration and
use it in-depth, probably in much greater detail than you've
previously considered. In my experience the vast majority of Linux
users, and even administrators, tend to leave their syslog
installations with default settings, tweaking them little if at
all. This is seldom a good idea.</p><p>I should also mention that if you're really interested in
granular, flexible logging, Balazs Scheidler's excellent syslog-ng
(syslog, new generation) is well worth checking out. But it's still
nowhere near as ubiquitous as syslog, so I won't do more than
mention it this time. See the Resources section for more
information on syslog-ng.</p><p><a href="5476s1.html" target="_self">What about klogd?</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xeee818"></a>Configuring syslog</h2></div></div><p>Whenever syslogd, the syslog d&aelig;mon, receives a log
message, it acts based on the message's type (or facility) and its
priority. <span   class="bold"><b>syslog</b></span>'s mapping of
actions to facilities and priorities is specified in
/etc/syslog.conf. Each line in this file specifies one or more
facility/priority selectors followed by an action. A selector
consists of a facility or facilities and a (single)
priority.</p><p>In the following syslog.conf line, mail.notice is the
selector and /var/log/mail is the action (i.e., &ldquo;write messages to
/var/log/mail&rdquo;):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail.notice     /var/log/mail
</pre><p>Within the selector, &ldquo;mail&rdquo; is the facility (message
category) and &ldquo;notice&rdquo; is the level of priority.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xeeea80"></a>Facilities</h2></div></div><p>Facilities are simply categories. Supported facilities in
Linux are auth, authpriv, cron, d&aelig;mon, kern, lpr, mail, mark,
news, syslog, user, UUCP and local0 through local7. Some of these
are self-explanatory, but of special note are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>auth: used for many security events.</p></li><li><p>authpriv: used for access-control-related
messages.</p></li><li><p>d&aelig;mon: used by system processes and other
d&aelig;mons.</p></li><li><p>kern: used for kernel messages.</p></li><li><p>mark: messages generated by syslogd itself that
contain only a timestamp and the string &ldquo;--MARK--&rdquo;. To specify
how many minutes should transpire between marks, invoke syslogd
with the -m [minutes] flag.</p></li><li><p>user: the default facility when none is specified
by an application or in a selector.</p></li><li><p>local7: boot messages.</p></li><li><p>*: wildcard signifying &ldquo;any facility&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>none: wildcard signifying &ldquo;no facility&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xeef210"></a>Priorities</h2></div></div><p>Unlike facilities, which have no relationship to each other,
priorities are hierarchical. Possible priorities in Linux are (in
increasing order of urgency): debug, info, notice, warning, err,
crit, alert and emerg. Note that the urgency of a given message is
determined by the programmer who wrote it; facility and priority
are set by the programs that generate messages, not by
syslog.</p><p>As with facilities, the wildcards &ldquo;*&rdquo; and &ldquo;none&rdquo; also may
be used. Only one priority or wildcard may be specified per
selector. A priority may be preceded by either or both of the
modifiers &ldquo;=&rdquo; and &ldquo;!&rdquo;.</p><p>If you specify a single priority in a selector (without
modifiers), you're actually specifying that priority plus all
higher priorities. Thus the selector mail.notice translates to
&ldquo;all mail-related messages having a priority of notice or
higher&rdquo;, i.e., having a priority of notice, warning, err, crit,
alert or emerg.</p><p>This behavior can be canceled by prepending an = to the
priority. The selector mail.=notice translates to &ldquo;all
mail-related messages having a priority of notice&rdquo;. Priorities may
also be negated: mail.!notice is equivalent to &ldquo;all mail messages
except those with priority of notice or higher&rdquo;, and mail.!=notice
corresponds to &ldquo;all mail messages except those with the priority
notice&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xeef420"></a>Actions</h2></div></div><p>In practice, most log messages are written to files. If you
list the full path to a filename as a line's action in syslog.conf,
messages that match that line will be appended to that file. (If
the file doesn't exist, syslog will create it.) In the syslog.conf
line above, we instructed syslog to send matched messages to the
file /var/log/mail.</p><p>You can send messages other places too. An action can be a
file, a named pipe, a device file, a remote host or a user's
screen. Pipes usually are used for debugging. Device files people
use tend to be TTYs, but some people also like to send security
information to /dev/lp0, that is, to a local line printer. Logs
that have been printed out can't be erased or altered by an
intruder, and this is an excellent use for old dot-matrix
printers.</p><p>Remote logging is one of the most useful features of syslog.
If you specify a hostname or IP address preceded by an &ldquo;@&rdquo; sign
as a line's action, messages that match that line will be sent to
that remote host. For example, the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.emerg          @mothership.mydomain.org
</pre><p>will tell syslogd to send all messages with emerg priority to
the host named mothership.mydomain.org. Note that the remote host's
(in this example, mothership's) syslogd process will need to have
been started with the -r flag in order for it to accept your log
messages. By default, syslogd does not accept messages from remote
systems.
</p><p>If you run a central logserver, which I highly recommend,
you'll want to consider having some sort of access controls on it
for incoming messages. At the very least you should consider
TCPwrappers' hosts-access (source-IP-based) controls or maybe even
local firewall rules (ipchains or iptables).</p><p><a href="5476s2.html" target="_self">Stealth Logservers</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xeef790"></a>More Sophisticated Selectors</h2></div></div><p>You can list multiple facilities separated by commas in a
single syslog.conf selector. To extend our original syslog.conf
line to include both mail and UUCP messages (still with priority
notice or higher), you could use this line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail,uucp.notice     /var/log/mail
</pre><p>The same is not true of priorities. Remember that only one
priority or priority wildcard may be specified in a single
selector.
</p><p>You may, however, specify multiple selectors separated by
semicolons. When a line contains multiple selectors, they're
evaluated from left to right; you should list general selectors
first, followed by more specific selectors. Think of selectors as
filters: as a message is passed through the line from left to
right, it passes first through coarse filters and then through more
granular ones.</p><p>Continuing our one-line example, suppose we still want
important mail and UUCP messages to be logged to /var/log/mail, but
we'd like to exclude UUCP messages with priority alert. Our line
then looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail,uucp.notice;uucp.!=alert     /var/log/mail
</pre><p>Actually, syslogd's behavior isn't as predictable as this may
imply. Listing selectors that contradict each other or that go from
specific to general, rather than the other way around, can yield
unexpected results. Therefore, it's more accurate to say that for
best results, list general selectors to the left and their
exceptions (and/or more specific selectors) to the right.
</p><p>Wherever possible, keep things simple. You can use the logger
command to test your syslog.conf rules (see the &ldquo;Testing System
Logging with logger&rdquo; section toward the end of this
article).</p><p>Note that in the second selector (uucp.!=alert) we used the
prefix &ldquo;!=&rdquo; before the priority to signify &ldquo;not equal to&rdquo;. If
we wanted to exclude UUCP messages with priority alert and higher
(i.e, alert and emerg), we could omit the &ldquo;=&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mail,uucp.notice;uucp.!alert      /var/log/mail
</pre><p>You might wonder what will happen to a UUCP message of
priority info; this matches the second selector, so it should be
logged to /var/log/mail, right? Based on the above examples, it
won't. Since the line's first selector matches only mail and UUCP
messages of priority notice and higher, such a message wouldn't be
evaluated against the second selector.
</p><p>There's nothing to stop you from having a different line for
dealing with info-level UUCP messages, however. You even can have
more than one line deal with these if you want. Unlike a firewall
rule-base, each log message is tested against all lines in
/etc/syslog.conf and acted on as many times as it matches.</p><p>Suppose we want emergency messages broadcast to all logged-in
users as well as being written to their respective application
logs. We could use something like the sample shown in Listing 1 to
achieve this. Note the &ldquo;-&rdquo; sign in front of the write-to-file
actions. This tells syslogd not to synchronize the specified log
file after writing a message that matches that line.</p><p><a href="5476l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. A Sample syslog.conf
File</a></p><p>Skipping synchronization increases the chances of introducing
inconsistencies such as missing or incomplete log messages into
those files, but it decreases disk utilization and thus improves
performance. Use the minus sign, therefore, in lines that you
expect to result in frequent file writes.</p><p>In Listing 1 we see some useful redundancy. Kernel warnings
plus all messages of error-and-higher priority, except authpriv
messages, are printed to the X-console window. All messages having
priority of emergency and higher are printed there too and are also
written to the screens of all logged-in users.</p><p>Furthermore, all mail messages and kernel messages are
written to their respective log files. All messages of all
priorities (except mail messages of any priority) are written to
/var/log/messages.</p><p>The previous examples were adapted from the default
syslog.conf that SuSE 7.1 put on one of my systems. But why isn't
such a default syslog.conf file fine the way it is? Why change it
at all?</p><p>Maybe you needn't, but probably you should. In most cases
default syslog.conf files either assign to important messages at
least one action that won't bring those messages to your attention
effectively (e.g., by sending messages to a TTY console on a system
you only access via SSH), or they handle at least one type of
message with too much or too little redundancy to meet your
needs.</p><p>Table 1 summarizes syslog.conf syntax, facility values,
severity values and action types. Note that the three main columns
of this table are independent; there's no correlation between
facilities, severities and actions, i.e., a message may be sent to
any facility with any severity and have any allowed action
performed on it. Note also that the numeric facility and severity
codes are provided strictly for reference; you should not use these
in syslog.conf, but you may come across them in source code or in a
packet-dump of network traffic.</p><p><a href="5476t1.jpg" target="_self">Table 1. Summary of syslog.conf Usage
and Values</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xee68b8"></a>Running syslogd</h2></div></div><p>Just as the default syslog.conf may not meet your needs, the
default startup mode of syslogd may need tweaking. Table 2 and
subsequent paragraphs touch on some syslogd startup flags that are
particularly relevant to security, but for a complete list you
should refer to the man page sysklogd(8).</p><p><a href="5476t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. syslogd Startup
Flags</a></p><p>In addition, note that when you're changing and testing
syslog's configuration and startup options, it usually makes sense
to start and stop syslogd and klogd in tandem (see the Sidebar
&ldquo;What about klogd?&rdquo; if you don't know what klogd is). Since it
also makes sense to start and stop these the same way your system
does, I recommend that you use your system's syslogd/klogd startup
script.</p><p>On most Linux systems this startup script is either in
/etc/init.d/syslog or /etc/init.d/sysklog (sysklog is shorthand for
&ldquo;syslog and klogd&rdquo;).</p><p>The first syslogd flag we'll discuss is the only one used by
default by Red Hat 7.x in its /etc/init.d/syslog script: -m 0,
which disables mark messages. These messages contain only a
timestamp and the string &ldquo;--MARK--&rdquo;, which some people find
useful for navigating lengthy log files. Others find them
distracting and redundant, given that each message has its own
timestamp anyhow.</p><p>To turn mark messages on, specify a positive nonzero value
after -m that tells syslogd how many minutes should pass before it
sends itself a mark message. Remember that mark has its own
facility called, predictably, mark, and you must specify at least
one selector that matches mark messages (such as mark.*, which
matches all messages sent to the mark facility, or *.*, which
matches all messages in all facilities).</p><p>For example, to make syslogd generate mark messages every 30
minutes and record them in /var/log/messages, you first would add a
line to /etc/syslog.conf similar to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mark.*               -/var/log/messages
</pre><p>You would then need to start syslogd as shown here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mylinuxbox:/etc/init.d# ./syslogd -m 30
</pre>


Another useful syslogd flag is -a [<span   class="emphasis"><em>socket</em></span>].
This allows you to specify one or more sockets in addition to
/dev/log for syslogd to accept messages from.
</p><p>If you've ever secured a nameserver running BIND, you may
have used -a to allow a chroot-ed named process to bounce its
messages from a dev/log device file in the chroot jail to the
non-chroot-ed syslogd process. In such a case, since named can't
access /dev/log, it has its own, for example, /var/named/dev/log.
You therefore need a line in /etc/init.d/syslog like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
daemon syslogd -m 0 -a /var/named/dev/log
</pre><p>Note that the d&aelig;mon function at the beginning of this
line is unique to Red Hat's init script functions; the important
part here is
<pre     class="programlisting">
syslogd -m 0 -a /var/named/dev/log
</pre>


More than one -a flag may be specified, like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
syslogd -a /var/named/dev/log -a /var/otherchroot/dev/log -a /additional/dev/log
</pre>


Continuing down the list of flags in Table 2, suppose you need to
test a new syslog configuration file named syslog.conf.test but
prefer not to overwrite /etc/syslog.conf, which is where syslogd
looks for its configuration file by default. Use the -f flag to
tell syslogd to use your new configuration file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mylinuxbox:/etc/init.d# ./syslogd -f ./syslog.conf.test
</pre>


We've already covered use of the -r flag, which tells syslogd to
accept log messages from remote hosts, but we haven't talked about
the security ramifications. On the one hand, security clearly is
enhanced when you use a centralized logserver or do (almost)
anything else that makes it easier for you to manage and monitor
your logs.
</p><p>On the other hand, you must take different threat models into
account. Are your logs sensitive? If log messages traverse any
untrusted network, and if the inner workings of the servers that
send those messages are best kept secret, then in fact the risks
may outweigh the benefit (at least, the specific benefit of
syslogd's unauthenticated clear-text remote logging
mechanism).</p><p>If this is the case for you, you definitely should consider
using syslog-ng. <span   class="bold"><b>syslog-ng</b></span> can
send remote messages via the TCP protocol and therefore can be used
in conjunction with stunnel, ssh and other tools that greatly can
enhance its security. Since syslog uses only the connectionless UDP
protocol for remote logging and, therefore, can't tunnel its
messages though stunnel or ssh, syslog is inherently less securable
than syslog-ng.</p><p>If your log messages aren't sensitive (at least, the ones you
send to a remote logger), then there's still the problem of
denial-of-service and message-forgery attacks. If you invoke
syslogd with the -r flag, it will accept all remote messages
without performing any checks whatsoever on the validity of the
messages themselves or on their senders. Again, this risk is most
effectively mitigated by using syslog-ng.</p><p>One tool you can use with syslog to mitigate partially the
risk of invalid remote messages is TCPwrappers. Specifically,
TCPwrappers' hosts-access authentication mechanism provides a
simple means of defining which hosts may connect, via which
protocols, to your logserver. Hosts-access authentication is
tricked easily by source-IP spoofing (especially since syslog
transactions are strictly one-way), but it's better than nothing
and is probably sufficient to prevent mischievous but lazy
attackers from interfering with syslog.</p><p>If you're willing to bet that it is, obtain and install
TCPwrappers (all modern Linux distributions have a binary package
of it; some even install it by default), and refer to its
hosts_access(5) man page for details. Note that despite its name,
TCPwrappers' hosts access can be used to control UDP-based
applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf6580.0xee71a8"></a>Testing System Logging with logger</h2></div></div><p>Before we leave the topic of system-logger configuration and
use, we should cover a tool that can be used to test your new
configurations regardless of which log d&aelig;mon you use.
<span   class="bold"><b>logger</b></span> is a command-line
application that sends messages to the system logger. Besides its
relevance as a diagnostic tool, logger especially is useful for
adding logging functionality to shell scripts.</p><p>The usage we're interested in here is diagnostics. (Although,
come to think of it, you really should use this tool in any
important scripts you routinely run, especially ones that run
unattended via cron or at.) The easiest way to explain how to use
logger in this regard is with an example.</p><p>Suppose you've reconfigured syslog to send all d&aelig;mon
messages with priority &ldquo;warn&rdquo; to /var/log/warnings. To test the
new syslog.conf file, you'd first restart syslogd and klogd, then
you'd enter a command like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mylinuxbox:~# logger -p daemon.warn
"This is only a test."
</pre><p>As you can see, logger's syntax is simple. The -p parameter
allows you to specify a facility/priority selector. Everything
after this selector, and any other parameters or flags, is taken to
be the message.
</p><p>Because I'm a fast typist, I often use while-do loops in
interactive bash sessions to run impromptu scripts (actually
complex command lines). The following sequence of bash commands
works either interactively or in a script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mylinuxbox:~# for i in
&gt; do
&gt; logger -p daemon.$i "Test daemon message, level $i"
&gt; done
</pre><p>This sends test messages to the d&aelig;mon facility for each
of all eight priorities. Listing 2, presented in the form of an
actual script, generates messages for all facilities at each
priority level.

testing and using custom syslog configurations. May your logs be
