    The modular design and absence of a back-end database make for a powerful and adaptable interface.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2508580.0x2600710"></a></h2></div></div><p>To quote their web site, &ldquo;Webmin is a
web-based interface for system administration for Unix.&rdquo; I found
Webmin a few years ago when I was looking to register the domain
webmin.com. I had an idea for a cool control panel to help
administer my Linux server farm, and I was annoyed that someone had
gotten to the domain first, until I started looking at the software
they had for downloading. After that I was hooked.
</p><p>Webmin's goal of providing a web-based interface is not
unique. A number of tools are out there, both open source and
commercial, with the same goal. What makes Webmin stand out from
the crowd is that it can be useful to both experienced and
inexperienced Linux administrators. Before I explain how it
fulfills such a difficult task, let's look at how you install the
software and what you can do with it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2508580.0x2600870"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>Before we delve into the feature set of Webmin, I should
explain a little about its design. Webmin is basically a large
collection of CGIs written in Perl. It runs its own web server on a
port that you specify when you install it, allowing you to manage
the security of Webmin separately from your real web server. The
full list of supported platforms is on the site, and it includes
Red Hat, Solaris, Debian, *BSD, HP-UX, IRIX, AIX, DEC, SCO and Mac
OS X.</p><p>What makes Webmin unique is its modular design. Every service
or feature is exposed through a set of modules. This means that if
the application you would like to control from Webmin is not
supported, you can use the Webmin API to build a new module that
will allow Webmin to control it. Webmin ships with 50 standard
modules and many more are available, so you have plenty of source
code examples to help get you started. Although Webmin itself is
distributed under the BSD license, the modules you build can be
distributed under any license you choose. This keeps the tool open
to submissions from both the Open Source community and commercial
vendors.</p><p>Installation is a breeze; go to
<a href="http://www.webmin.com/webmin" target="_self">www.webmin.com/webmin</a>
and download either the RPM or the tarball. If you use the tarball,
you will need to run the setup.sh once you have unpacked it. This
program handles the installation for you. One tip if you use the
tarball: make sure you unpack it where you want those files to
live. After you have installed Webmin, do not delete the Webmin
directory you just unpacked or Webmin will not work. If you want to
uninstall Webmin later, an uninstall script is included that will
remove the initial directory as well as all the other files Webmin
puts on your drive.</p><p>Now that you have Webmin installed, you need to open a web
browser and log in to the IP address/resolvable server name and
port (typically 10,000) that you configured Webmin to use when you
installed it (see Figure 1). Once you have logged in, you should be
greeted by the index page of Webmin, including several category
tabs in which the various Webmin modules are grouped (see Figure
2). For example, the &ldquo;Webmin&rdquo; tab is where all the configuration
settings for general themes, users, modules, etc., are located (the
default theme is used in these figures). Other tab groupings
include System, Servers, Networking, Hardware and Others.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5477f1.large.jpg"><img src="5477f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p><p>The System tab handles tasks that have to do with managing
the computer or server itself. This includes setting disk quotas,
setting up NIS, altering PAM, looking at the syslog, adding users,
managing cron, setting up NFS and even modifying boot-time services
or rebooting the server.</p><p>The Servers tab groups all the server service configuration
modules together. This is where you will find Apache, BIND, DHCP,
sendmail, Squid and a number of other related modules (see Figure
3).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5477f3.large.jpg"><img src="5477f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Webmin Modules under the Server
Tab</p></div></div>
</p><p>The Networking tab is a new addition, and on Linux it offers
a good GUI ipchains configuration module, as well as a subcategory
of various network utilities such as ping, traceroute, whois and
dig.</p><p>The Hardware tab, of course, handles things that are directly
hardware-related. This is where you will find information about
your disk partitions, system time, network interface
configurations, LILO and even software RAID.</p><p>The last tab is a potpourri category that has a full
Java-based ssh/Telnet client, Java-based file manager, special
user-definable module called Custom Commands, system log viewer,
Perl modules section, and web-based system and server-status
monitoring module. The Custom Commands module lets you build a
simple interface to Webmin that allows you to run any command you
want. This can be very useful if you need Webmin to do something
specific that does not require a full module to accomplish. Figure
4 shows some custom examples that were created quickly and
easily.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2508580.0x2601478"></a>Step-by-Step Guide</h2></div></div><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to configuring a new
virtual-hosted web site in Apache. This guide will show you how to
set up the document root, cgi-bin and logging. It looks a lot more
complicated than it is. (I discovered that writing the directions
for a point-and-click interface takes a lot more effort than just
pointing and clicking.)</p><p>For this example, the user ID &ldquo;dirk&rdquo; already exists, and
the virtualhost/domain we will create is test.com. It also assumes
that you are using Wu-FTPd and that the domain you are setting up
already resolves in DNS. First create the directories (folders)
that will contain the HTML files, log files and CGI scripts for
your web site. Go to the main Webmin page and click on the Other
tab. Next, click on File Manager.</p><p>Use File Manager to navigate to the home directory of the web
site's administrator. The administrator's home directory is the
directory that the user will go to when using FTP to connect to the
server. The home directory of this user is /home/username. Double
click on the home directory (folder) in the left column. Double
click on the user name of the web site administrator inside the
home directory.</p><p>Now you need to create the necessary directories for the web
site. Click on the New Folder button (the button that says &ldquo;New&rdquo;
with the folder icon) to create the main directory for your domain
(e.g., /home/dirk/test.com). Double click on the directory you
created (e.g., test.com) to move inside it. Now, create three
folders (htdocs, logs and cgi-bin) in the directory you just
created. In our example, we would have created the following
directories: /home/dirk/test.com, /home/dirk/test.com/htdocs,
/home/dirk/test.com/logs and /home/dirk/test.com/cgi-bin.</p><p>Now, go back to the home directory for the user. In the right
column, click once on the directory for the web site (e.g.,
test.com), then click on the Info button at the top of the page. In
the Info window, change the user and group to the correct user ID
(e.g., dirk). Change the pop-up menu in the &ldquo;Apply changes to&rdquo;
section to &ldquo;This directory and all subdirectories&rdquo;. Click
Save.</p><p>Go back to the main Webmin page by clicking on &ldquo;Return to
index&rdquo; at the bottom of the page. Click on the Servers tab, then
click on Apache Webserver. If this is the first time you have
clicked on Apache Webserver in Webmin, it will ask you to allow
Webmin to check the configuration of Apache (just click on
Configure).</p><p>Now scroll to the bottom of the page, and you will see a form
for adding new virtual sites. Enter the IP address for the web site
in the Address text field. If you are doing name-based hosting,
make sure the &ldquo;Add name virtual server address&rdquo; box is checked. The
Document Root should be
/home/<span   class="emphasis"><em>userid</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span>/htdocs
(e.g., /home/dirk/test.com/htdocs). Enter the name of the web site
in the Server Name text field (e.g., www.test.com), and click
Create.</p><p>Scroll through the Virtual Servers list until you find the
web site you created. Click on the Virtual Server for that web
site. To set up your cgi-bin folder, click on &ldquo;CGI Programs&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;CGI directory aliases&rdquo; row. In the From text field, enter
/cgi-bin/. In the To text field, enter
/home/<span   class="emphasis"><em>userid</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span>/cgi-bin/.
This must end with a &ldquo;/&rdquo; (e.g., /home/dirk/test.com/cgi-bin/).
Click Save.</p><p>Click on Log Files. In Access Log Files, enter
/home/<span   class="emphasis"><em>userid</em></span>/<span   class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span>/logs/access_log
(e.g., /home/dirk/test.com/logs/access_log) in the text field that
has File or Program written above it. If you would like to have a
log that contains hits and referrer information, then in the Format
column of the &ldquo;Access log files row&rdquo;, switch the check box from
Default to the check box next to the text field and enter
&ldquo;combined&rdquo; in the text field. Click Save, and click on
&ldquo;Networking and Addresses&rdquo;. Enter the e-mail address of the
webmaster for this web site in the &ldquo;Server Admin email address&rdquo;
text field. Then check the box next to the text field, and click
Save.</p><p>You have now set up the web site, but before it goes live
there is one final and important step. In the upper right-hand
corner is a link called Apply Changes; click on it to activate your
changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2508580.0x2601aa8"></a>Security</h2></div></div><p>Webmin offers a number of security features. The first line
of defense is a user ID/password authentication system that is
completely independent of the user ID list kept in the /etc/passwd
file. This means someone can be granted access to Webmin without
allowing the user any other OS-level system privileges. Webmin also
fully supports SSL. If you have the Perl SSL module installed, all
your Webmin sessions can be encrypted to prevent attackers from
gaining information about your system from watching them.</p><p>Webmin also allows for fine-grained control of the various
available modules. You can, for example, grant users control over
the entire DNS server without giving them access to Apache
configurations or limit them to only the domains they own in the
DNS module (see Figure 4). This ability to limit and redistribute
control can come in handy if you need to delegate tasks to other
administrators. Finally, Webmin also can be configured to log all
changes made via the interface, a feature that is extremely useful
for troubleshooting.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2508580.0x2601c08"></a>What Makes Webmin Great?</h2></div></div><p>As you can probably tell, I am a big fan of Webmin. I like
that the license lets me get the source code and do what I want. I
love the fact that the module system lets me build new things or
add modules others have built. I currently am testing the LTSP
module for Webmin to help manage some unruly I-Openers. The ability
to transfer tasks to less experienced administrators (roommates)
and know that they cannot deviate from the area I have provisioned
for them, lightens my workload.</p><p>If that were all Webmin had to offer, I would be quite
impressed. There is one final benefit of the Webmin architecture,
however. Webmin works directly with all the files on the system to
affect its changes, meaning it does not use a database or other
means of storing information that is in any way nonstandard. I can
therefore edit the httpd.conf for Apache by hand without worrying
that it will cause problems for Webmin. From a support standpoint,
this means I can install Webmin on a server and turn it over to
someone else. If that person problems I still can use all of my
scripts and vi knowledge to troubleshoot the problem.</p><p>The command-line friendliness and absence of a master
back-end database that pushes the config out to the flat files are
things that control panel designers all too often forget. They end
up building a system requiring that everything be done via the
control panel or it will break. Webmin allows me to mix-and-match
administration styles at my convenience. For example, I tend to
make my Apache configuration changes directly. BIND, however, is a
different story. BIND is notoriously picky, so I use Webmin as a
convenient front end to BIND. It offers me all the esoteric options
and greatly lowers the risk that a typo will cause a resolve error.
To me, the amazing thing is how well Webmin fits into my
administration toolbox. I do not have to use it, but it is always
there.</p><p>New administrators will come to like Webmin because of its
depth of features. The point-and-click interface means that you do
not have to keep everything in your head, which can prove to be a
daunting task for someone new to administering a Linux server.
Webmin's core modules expose almost every feature and function of
the services they support. This means you easily can add
configuration options that you did not previously know
existed.</p><p>My only caveat to this is that although Webmin is well
organized and feature-complete, it is not for absolute beginners.
If you do not know what an A record for DNS is, then Webmin will
not help you. Webmin maps the underlying Linux to a web interface,
so sometimes when you get this much flexibility and power, you have
to sacrifice ease of use. Once you know the fundamentals of the
services, Webmin can be a great tool&mdash;just don't expect it to
summarize the O'Reilly book on BIND for you.</p><p><a href="5477s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
