    Hugo shows how to use Mondo to restore your system in the event of catastrophic data loss.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26f95b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Every computer user has lost data at some
point. Unfortunately, the experience rarely teaches the user to
backup his or her data regularly. Mondo Rescue creates one or more
bootable Rescue CDs based on your filesystem. In the event of
catastrophic data loss, you will be able to restore your entire
system. Mondo supports Lin/Win dual-boot systems, RAID, ReiserFS,
ext2, ext3, XFS, JFS and VFAT.
</p><p>I wrote Mondo because no other program did what I wanted, nor
was any program as easy to use. I back up, wipe, format and restore
my own system at least three times a week using Mondo's latest
release. Mondo is the only backup regime that I use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26f9710"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>Mondo is a thriving open-source project; it can restore your
OS and data from bare metal, and data loss has not been reported
since May 2000. The project is coming along nicely.</p><p>In the beginning, Mondo was created to back up Windows-only
systems and provide disaster recovery facilities for Windows users.
While running a small computer store near Nashville, Tennessee, I
realized that many of the people that bought computers from us were
bringing them back to have the disks reformatted and the
applications re-installed. Was this because they did not know how
to maintain their own PCs? Was our hardware to blame? Either way,
we needed a way to restore a fresh copy of Windows onto a typical
PC, unattended, in 10-15 minutes. We were using Norton Ghost at the
time, but Ghost didn't let us restore selectively; it was all or
nothing. Also, Ghost tended to crash when copying Linux
partitions.</p><p>Our idea was to run Linux on a CD but have Windows archived
in big tarballs on said CD. Well, to cut a long and tortuous story
short, it worked. I even managed to write code that would create a
Windows-bootable VFAT partition.</p><p>In March 2001, an employee of Hewlett-Packard (Grenoble)
became interested in the project. Bruno Cornec, a skilled
programmer in the server division, began to look at the code. He
started to play with it and improved it in numerous ways. Between
September 2000 (when the project was shut down) and March 2001, two
new versions of Mondo were released. Both were made possible almost
entirely by Bruno Cornec, Maciej Kulasa and other
contributors.</p><p>In June 2001, I built a new computer and got to work. By July
4, I had fixed all the major bugs, and Mondo v1.00 was released (no
jokes about Independence Day, please).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26f9978"></a>How It Works</h2></div></div><p>Mondo is just a bit shell script that wraps around two other
tools: Mindi and afio.</p><p>Mindi, aka Mindi-Linux, is a mini-distribution that generates
boot disks from your kernel, modules, tools and libraries. It is
more likely than a generic boot disk to be binary-compatible with
your existing software because its tools are copied straight from
your hard disk. It also can generate an El Torito 2.88MB boot disk
image. Mondo uses Mindi to create a 2.88MB boot &ldquo;disk&rdquo; and
associated data &ldquo;disks&rdquo;, which are incorporated in each Mondo CD.
Whichever modules were loaded at backup time are reloaded at boot
time. So, in theory you will boot into almost the same environment
you were in when you backed up.</p><p>Mondo-Archive works something like this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It squeezes your files into several tarballs, each
5-10MB in size.</p></li><li><p>It puts those tarballs in a directory.</p></li><li><p>It puts an El Torito boot floppy image and
associated data files in that directory.</p></li><li><p>It points mkisofs at that directory and pipes its
output to cdrecord, which causes a CD to be burned that contains a
copy of that directory and its contents.</p></li><li><p>It repeats the above steps for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> CDs, <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> being the number
of CDs it takes to accommodate all your files.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26f9fa8"></a>Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Mindi v0.38 comes with a 2.4.7 fail-safe kernel, in case your
kernel does not support all the features required by a boot disk.
This is not Mondo being picky; this is Linux being awkward. Some
kernels are just not suitable for boot disks. Novice users should
stick with their default kernel and make Mindi use its own kernel
by saying no when asked if they want to make a boot disk with their
own kernel.</p><p>Advanced users should make sure that their kernel includes
the following, built-in: CD-ROM support, IDE CD support, IDE
support, initrd and RAM disk support, floppy disk drive support,
stable loopfs support (which means it really needs to be 2.2.17 or
later, or 2.4.5-ac10 or later) and ISO9660 support.</p><p>In case your kernel does not support these features, you
should probably use Mindi's own kernel until you are confident
enough to build your own kernel. If you find that Mindi's kernel
does not support something you need (e.g., XFS) then please let me
know. I will probably add the feature to the next release of
Mindi.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26fa160"></a>Getting and Installing Mondo</h2></div></div><p>To install the program, go to
<a href="http://www.microwerks.net/~hugo" target="_self">www.microwerks.net/~hugo</a>
and download Mondo and Mindi. The latter is part of the former but
was forked because Mindi also creates standalone boot disks based
on your kernel, modules, tools and libraries. Installation
instructions for both tools are provided on the Download web
page.</p><p>RPM users have it easy; they simply need to download Mindi's
RPM to /tmp, download Mondo's RPM to /tmp and then type the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Uvh /tmp/mondo-1.13-1.i386.rpm /tmp/mindi-0.39-1.i386.rpm
</pre><p>Tarball users have a slightly harder time; they must download
Mindi's tarball to /tmp, download Mondo's tarball to /tmp and then
type the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tmp
tar -zxvf mindi-0.39.tgz
cd mindi-0.39
./install.sh
cd ..
tar -zxvf mondo-1.13.tgz
cd mondo-1.12
./install.sh
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26fa420"></a>Other Tools Needed by Mondo</h2></div></div><p>Some distributions lack certain crucial packages. The
packages most often missing are afio, cdrecord, bzip2, libnewt0.50,
libslang1 and mkisofs. Some users may have to create a gawk-to-awk
shortcut. You can find these tools on the web site of the vendor of
your distribution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x26fa528"></a>Make a Test CD</h2></div></div><p>Making a test CD is a good idea because the new user can try
it and not mess up his or her system. First, be sure that Linux
knows how to use your CD writer. Then, run
<b  >mondo-archive</b>.</p><p>To find your CD writer, type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dmesg | grep CD
</pre><p>If your CD writer is an IDE device, it will show up here as
/dev/hd<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> being a
letter between a and h. If SCSI emulation is properly configured,
you will see your CD writer listed when you type
<pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord -scanbus
</pre>


If your CD writer is properly installed, you will see
<pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>0,0,0</em></span> --- JoeCamel 4x CD Writer
</pre>


or something similar. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>0,0,0</em></span> number to the
left of the device description is the SCSI device where the writer
can be found. Write this number down.
</p><p>If you want your rescue CD to include certain special
programs, e.g., your copy of BRU, add the file and its config files
to /usr/share/mindi/deplist.txt by hand. Mindi will find the
libraries and add them for you.</p><p>Run Mindi to create some boot disks just to make sure Mindi
works properly on your system. Type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/share/mindi
./mindi

</pre><p>If your kernel is too large (more than about 900KB), you
cannot make boot floppies, although you still can make a bootable
CD image. The easiest way to test Mindi in either case is to press
N to &ldquo;Create boot floppies?&rdquo; and Y to &ldquo;Create iso image?&rdquo; Then
use <b  >cdrecord</b> to make a bootable CD-R or CD-RW.
Type
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /root/images/mindi
</pre>


Then choose one of the following calls to write the CD, depending
on whether the disk in the drive is a CD-R or a CD-RW. Please
replace <span   class="emphasis"><em>x,x,x</em></span> with your writer's SCSI node.
For CD-RW, type
<pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord blank=fast dev=<span   class="emphasis"><em>x,x,x</em></span> speed=2 mindi.iso
</pre>


and for CD-R, type
<pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord dev=<span   class="emphasis"><em>x,x,x</em></span> speed=2 mindi.iso

</pre>


Close all applications; reboot from the CD instead of the hard
disk. (You may have to edit your BIOS settings to make your
computer try to boot from the CD before the hard drive.) If your
computer boots okay from the CD then you know Mondo also will
generate a bootable rescue CD reliably. Of course, an ideal rescue
CD will use your own kernel. I recommend that you use your own
kernel if possible, to minimize the risk that the boot CD won't
support your hardware or filesystems, etc.
</p><p>Finally, to do a complete backup, type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home
mondo-archive --burn-cds 2 <span   class="emphasis"><em>0,0,0</em></span> --comp-level 9
</pre><p>The 2 indicates that you are writing at 2x speed. If you are
burning to CD-RWs, type
<pre     class="programlisting">
mondo-archive --burn-cds 2 <span   class="emphasis"><em>0,0,0</em></span> cdrw --comp-level 9
</pre>


After running the command, insert a blank CD-R(W) into the drive
and leave the PC running. That's all.
</p><p>I always choose the maximum compression level (9) because I
start Mondo and then go to work. When I come home, I insert the
second CD-RW and wait a half an hour. That is a day's
backup.</p><p>The default compression level is 3. If you are in a hurry,
use <b  >--comp-level 1</b> to speed up the backup
process. You will use more CDs that way, but it should take less
time to run.</p><p>If Mondo does not find a CD in the drive when it tries to
write files to the CD, it will pause with a Retry/Fail/Abort
message. If you insert a CD and choose Retry, it will retry as if
nothing had gone wrong. If you choose Abort, the program will stop.
If you choose Fail, the program will skip that CD but continue the
backup process. Mostly, you should choose Retry.</p><p>If there are specific paths that you do not wish to backup,
you may exclude them with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--exclude-paths /foo /bar /xanadu
</pre><p>If you want to include only certain paths, use
<b  >--bkpath /home</b>. So, if you want to backup only
your home and boot directories but exclude the communal MP3 folder,
use this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mondo-archive --burn-cds 2 <span   class="emphasis"><em>0,0,0</em></span> cdrw --exclude-paths /home/MP3s /home/WAVs /home/secret
</pre>


If you do not want to burn the CDs immediately but would rather
create ISO disk images to be burned later, do this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mondo-archive --isodir /root --bkpath /home /boot --exclude-paths /home/MP3s /home/WAVs /home/secret
</pre>


This will create 1.ISO, 2.ISO, etc., and save the files to the
/root directory.
</p><p>Before running Mondo-Archive, be sure to add some files to
/usr/share /mindi/deplist.txt, run <b  >mount</b> to make
sure you have mounted the partitions that you want be backed up and
run <b  >df</b> to determine backup size/compression/CDs
needed.</p><p>You can speed up the compare process by switching to another
terminal after booting and running ide-opt. Use Alt-left cursor key
and type <b  >ide-opt</b>. This enables DMA and other
good stuff.</p><p>To compare the backup against your live filesystem, please
boot from the CD and choose compare mode (type
<b  >compare</b> and then press Enter). Check
/tmp/mondo-restore.log after the compare cycle to see which files
do not match. Aside from the initial teething troubles you might
encounter with making boot disks from your kernel (some kernels are
not appropriate for boot disks and have to be recompiled), you are
likely to discover that Mondo is quite boring. It does what it says
it does. It squeezes all your files onto your CD-R(W)s, and it
restores them again if necessary. It partitions your drives,
formats them, restores the data and runs LILO to set up your boot
sector.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x2af37f8"></a>Bare-Bones Restore</h2></div></div><p>Imagine that your hard drives happen to be wiped,
deliberately or accidentally. Or, imagine that you want to clone
your existing operating system. In either case, you want to run in
Nuke Mode. After booting from your Mondo CD, type
<b  >nuke</b>, press Enter and watch the show. That's
it.</p><p>If you want to see exactly what Mondo is doing while it is
restoring, press Alt-A and type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /tmp/mondo-restore.log
</pre><p>to monitor its progress in detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x2af3a60"></a>Selective Restore</h2></div></div><p>If you want to restore only some files, or if you do not want
to prep/format your drives, then you should boot into interactive
mode. Type <b  >interactive</b> and then press Enter at
boot time. You will be asked to say yes/no to a range of questions:
do you want to partition your devices? Do you want to format them?
Do you want to restore everything? Do you want to restore
something? Do you want to run LILO to set up your boot
sectors?</p><p>Interactive mode is for people who have lost a subset of data
from their live filesystem or perhaps who have lost some data from
their latest backup and want to restore a subset of data from an
earlier backup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2601580.0x2af3c18"></a>Using Expert Mode</h2></div></div><p>When you have backed up your system, booted from the CD in
compare mode and verified the archives, you are in a position to
experiment with your system. You could move partitions around,
resize them, enable or disable RAID, play with other boot loaders,
etc. That is what Mondo is really good for. The greatest threat to
a typical Linux installation, in my opinion, is a careless root
user.</p><p>If you want to try some of these tricks, boot from your Mondo
CD and choose expert mode. This will drop you to a shell prompt.
Edit the mountlist file. Then, type
<b  >mondo-restore</b> and choose Interactively from the
pop-up menu. The mountlist is a text file, /tmp/mountlist.txt,
located on the RAM disk after you boot from the Mondo CD. It lists
the various partitions that will be created, their sizes, their
mountpoints and their formats. To change the size or layout of your
partitions, just edit that file with <b  >pico
/tmp/mountlist.txt</b> (or use your favorite editor). Save
and close by pressing Ctrl-X and then Enter.</p><p>Here is a sample mountlist. The sizes are in kilobytes, so
count the zeros carefully when modifying the values. Remember, the
new layout will not take effect until you run
<b  >mondo-restore</b> to repartition and reformat the
drives:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda1    /mnt/windows       vfat        4096000
/dev/hda2    swap               swap        256
/dev/hda3    /                  ext2        8192000
</pre><p>To change the root partition's size and format, simply alter
the relevant fields:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda1    /mnt/windows       vfat        4096000
/dev/hda2    swap               swap        256
/dev/hda3    /                  reiserfs    16384000
</pre>


Or, you could move from using multiple primaries to using a primary
partition (hda1), an extended partition (hda2, created/handled by
Mondo) and several logical partitions. Note the new /dev/hdaN
entries:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda1    /mnt/windows       vfat        4096000
/dev/hda5    swap               swap        256
/dev/hda6    /                  reiserfs    8123000
/dev/hda7    /usr               reiserfs    4099000
/dev/hda8    /home              reiserfs    4099000
</pre>


If you have added a second hard drive (e.g., primary slave) then
you could move some of your partitions to that drive. See below and
note the changes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda1    /mnt/windows       vfat        4096000
/dev/hda2    swap               swap        256
/dev/hda3    /                  reiserfs    81422000
/dev/hdb1    /home              reiserfs    9481000
/dev/hdb5    /usr               reiserfs    16384000
/dev/hdb6    /tmp               reiserfs    1589000
</pre>


It is slightly more complicated to move to RAID because you have to
create an /etc/raidtab file. You can do this from within Expert
Mode. Just type <b  >pico /etc/raidtab</b> and create a
good raidtab file. (That is beyond the scope of this article.)
Then, replace the conventional device with a RAID device
(/dev/mdN):
<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/hda1    /mnt/windows       vfat        4096000
/dev/hda5    swap               swap        256
/dev/md0     /                  reiserfs    16384000
</pre>


After editing the mountlist, run <b  >mondo-restore</b>.
When asked if you want to partition and format the drives, say yes.
You may want to restore the data or run LILO to initialize the boot
sector, depending on what you are doing. If you are simply testing
a new partition layout, you probably want to say no when answering
the other questions. Otherwise, say yes.

easy to use. If the backup software is too fiddly then the user
simply will not bother. If it is unreliable, then the user will be
lulled into a false sense of security, only to have his or her
hopes dashed when the crunch comes. I back up my own system with
Mondo two or three times a week. I restore regularly as part of the
