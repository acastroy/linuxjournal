NetworX to work on LinuxBIOS, and I've been on a steep learning
curve ever since. After working on LinuxBIOS, I am qualified to say
that I have no question that the kernel code is high-level code and
that C is a high-level language.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2743580.0x283b710"></a>What Is LinuxBIOS?</h2></div></div><p>When a microprocessor powers up, it starts executing
instructions located in a ROM chip. These initial instructions are
responsible for initializing the hardware (especially enabling RAM)
and loading an operating system. The implementations and interfaces
to this functionality vary from machine to machine, but its basic
responsibility remains the same.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4888f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Boot Process Stages
</p></div></div><p>On the Alpha platform the microprocessor reads an entire
serial ROM, referred to as the SROM, into the instruction cache and
begins executing code. The code in the SROM initializes the
processor and memory and loads the SRM from a Flash EEPROM. The SRM
then loads the palcode (basically the real kernel on the Alpha),
initializes a little more hardware and loads an operating system.
Since the firmware is split into two pieces, the SRM can be
upgraded or even replaced. In fact, the initial design of the Alpha
architecture specified that there would be different firmware (at
the SRM level) for each operating system.</p><p>The x86 microprocessor begins executing code in 16-bit mode
at 16 bytes short of the end of the address space, with the CS
register pointing to 64K below the end of the address space. On the
8086 this is at address 0xf000:0xfff0 == 0xffff0, just below 1MB.
On the 80286 the address is 0xfffff0, just below 16MB. And on the
80386 and above, this space is at 0xfffffff0, just below 4GB. For
the 286 and later Intel processors, the value in CS is not one that
you can ever load again. To compensate for this, the hardware maps
the ROM chip at both 0xffff0000 and 0xf0000.</p><p>Unlike the Alpha, x86 processors fetch instructions one at a
time from the ROM chip. As ROM chips are essentially ISA devices,
this leads to some interesting consequences, the first being that
until some form of caching is enabled, the code runs quite slowly.
The second effect is that the chipset must come up mostly enabled,
as the usual path to the ROM chip is from the CPU to the
Northbridge, to the PCI Bus to the Southbridge, to the ISA Bus to
the ROM. When working with a known good board, this second fact
makes the debugging of initial devices much easier.</p><p>The standard PC BIOS has the responsibilities of initializing
the hardware, loading an operating system and providing a variety
of services (mostly in the form of minimal device drivers) after an
operating system has loaded.</p><p>SPARC and PowerPC architectures have specified firmware, also
known as OpenBoot, Open Firmware or the defunct IEEE 1275. The
standardized Forth firmware sits close to the same location that
the SRM does on the Alpha. There are several unique things about
Open Firmware: it runs on multiple processor and machine
architectures; it uses a Forth-based byte code, so the binaries are
processor-independent; and it does most of its system
initialization from this Forth-base byte code.</p><p>The Itanium/IA64 architecture uses the EFI firmware and is
more architecture-dependent than Open Firmware because its drivers
are either IA32 or IA64 code. In scope it appears to be even more
ambitious; EFI includes an IP stack and some filesystem drivers. As
with Open Firmware, the early hardware initialization stage is not
specified.</p><p>Requirements placed upon the firmware by the Linux kernel are
minimal. The Linux kernel directly drives the hardware and does not
use the BIOS. Since the Linux kernel does not use the BIOS, most of
the hardware initialization is overkill. Linux is not alone in this
respect; I don't know of a modern operating system that doesn't
follow this trend. Modern operating systems require only basic
system initialization services. Extra device drivers and system
features that firmware like EFI, Open Firmware or even a PCBIOS
provide are not necessary except to help load the operating system.
Since these services are not necessary, the LinuxBIOS code does not
provide them.</p><p>The LinuxBIOS code is sufficient to load a standalone program
encoded as an ELF executable from a Flash ROM. A standalone program
can be an operating system kernel like Linux, but most standalone
programs are hardware diagnostics or boot loaders (e.g., Memtest86,
Etherboot and RedBoot). LinuxBIOS is expected to be paired with a
standalone boot loader in order to load the operating
system.</p><p>The original idea of LinuxBIOS was to load the Linux kernel
from the ROM and build a boot loader on top of that. The boot
loader nbc implements this idea, loading a Linux kernel or a
standalone program over the network and booting from Linux using
the kexec kernel patch. This solution works fine when 512KB of ROM
(or more) is available. Unfortunately, most standard motherboards
shipping today have only 256KB of ROM. For the x86 platform it is
nearly impossible to get a useable Linux kernel under 360KB.</p><p>Various strategies have been developed to address these
systems limited by the amount of available ROM. Some of these
strategies include Tiara, which appears to be a complete firmware
and boot loader for the SiS630 chipset; Etherboot, which has been
ported to work under LinuxBIOS; RedBoot, which runs under LinuxBIOS
but is not yet useable; and some hacks on LinuxBIOS itself.</p><p>Alpha firmware requires a standalone program to be familiar
with the motherboard it is running on, which can be problematic.
While having this level of familiarity is nice, supporting a new
motherboard can be extremely difficult because of the number of
pieces of software that must be updated. With LinuxBIOS we do our
best to avoid that problem.</p><p>We start with the traditional x86 approach: initialize the
Super-IO chips to working and expected values (i.e., serial ports
at their expected legacy address, IRQ, etc.) and then provide IRQ
routing tables and mptables for SMP.</p><p>For the long term we need a table tracking the capabilities
Plug-and-Play has identified. This software lists what hardware is
present and configures which resources the hardware will use, or at
a minimum it lists which resources an individual device uses. The
solution I am working on involves creating a table of devices with
information about how they are connected to each other on the
motherboard. The table will list devices not currently
participating in any kind of Plug-and-Play enumeration, as well as
give enough information so that IRQ routing can be handled.
Additionally the idea seems to fit in well with the struct device
tree planned for the 2.5 kernel. ACPI appears to offer an
alternative solution but it seems PC-centric, and the interpreted
byte codes seem unnecessary and even dangerous.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2743580.0x283be48"></a>Is LinuxBIOS Doable?</h2></div></div><p>Since the first IBM PC, the hardware architecture of the boot
ROM has evolved considerably, so that today virtually every machine
has a BIOS that can be upgraded in the field or recovered from a
failed upgrade. The common technique to accomplish this is to have
a socketed Flash ROM on the motherboard. The Flash chip allows
software to update it while the socket allows replacement of the
chip if the update somehow fails. With this type of hardware
architecture, developing custom boot firmware is now possible. For
production machines, you can update firmware with no special
hardware, and during development you can recover if something goes
wrong.</p><p>A downside to current PC hardware architectures is that
normally boot ROMs, at 256KB, are too small. This is enough space
for firmware, but it isn't large enough for the Linux
kernel.</p><p>The Linux kernel can run from LinuxBIOS as well as it does
from a standard PCBIOS, when the port is done correctly. To date I
successfully have ported LinuxBIOS to three motherboards. On the
latest board, the results of booting Linux from LinuxBIOS and the
PCBIOS are indistinguishable. So while there are significant
technical hurdles in porting LinuxBIOS to new platforms, these can
be and have been overcome.</p><p>Having access to adequate documentation is a nontechnical
factor to consider. Convincing hardware vendors to support
LinuxBIOS, or to release the documentation for someone else to code
it, has met limited success to date. Missing or limited vendor
support is not a new issue for free software, and it has been
overcome in the past&mdash;now is not the point in the game to be
discouraged. It is worth remembering that without these kinds of
efforts there would be no new hardware on which we could run free
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2743580.0x283c058"></a>What Applications Are Available for
LinuxBIOS?</h2></div></div><p>Currently two different interest groups are working on
LinuxBIOS: one working on embedded systems and one building
large-scale computer clusters. For these applications the legacy
x86 firmware is suboptimal.</p><p>LinuxBIOS has a lot to recommend itself for embedded
applications. As it is released under the GPL, LinuxBIOS is
royalty-free. LinuxBIOS generally weighs in under 64KB and doesn't
waste ROM space with unnecessary functionality. Because it isn't a
legacy design, LinuxBIOS starts up fast, even without code
optimization.</p><p>In August 2001, General Software announced a 0.8-second boot
to LILO on an embedded board after a hardware reset. This is a
reasonable amount of time to do the job, but under LinuxBIOS such
impressive results are routine. I can load the kernel over the
network from a cold power-on in two seconds flat on a
dual-processor server board&mdash;without optimizing LinuxBIOS.</p><p>The small footprint of LinuxBIOS has impressed SiS enough
that they have devoted a developer to port LinuxBIOS to their
chipsets, aiming at embedded applications. This demonstrates one
well-supported platform.</p><p>For computer clusters, which is what Linux NetworX
specializes in, LinuxBIOS has a lot to recommend itself as well.
The serial port is the native console, so you don't need video
hardware. Serial connections can be redirected easily into a
terminal server for remote console access. The early setup of the
serial console also brings benefits. For example, LinuxBIOS can
report all errors and hardware failures over the serial console. A
normal BIOS, even with serial console extensions, will initialize
the serial port too late in the game for some failures to be
detected, and it will usually fail if the CMOS is cleared.</p><p>LinuxBIOS also supports network booting on most hardware
platforms, allowing changes to boot options to be made simply by
altering a setting on a DHCP server. Since the code is open source,
if the network booting policy is not to your liking it can be
changed. The fast booting of LinuxBIOS means that if you are
debugging something and have to reboot a node, the hardware doesn't
waste the valuable time of the system administrator.</p><p>The openness of LinuxBIOS and its focus on Linux allow it to
be configured and managed from user space under the Linux kernel.
Anything done from user space also can be set up to be done
remotely. This is a great advantage in homogeneous clusters,
allowing firmware changes to be made and managed globally instead
of one node at a time.</p><p>With large numbers of machines, the probability of hardware
failure is much larger than for a single machine. The reduced
hardware requirements of LinuxBIOS&mdash;such as unneeded floppy drives,
CD-ROMs or hard drives to boot from, and no need for a video card
and keyboard to control the system&mdash;can lead to a less expensive
and more reliable system. Fewer hardware components lead to a
reduced risk of hardware failures.</p><p>For clusters, LinuxBIOS also brings the potential to plug in
to the cluster and, with nothing more than the firmware running,
have a machine that acts as a single system, instead of a rack that
looks like a collection of nodes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2743580.0x283c420"></a>What Hardware Does LinuxBIOS Support?</h2></div></div><p>In the LinuxBIOS tree there are currently ports to 13
different mainboards. LinuxBIOS has been ported to both x86 and the
Alpha hardware architectures. It has run on the AMD Athlon, AMD
Duron, Pentium II, Pentium III, Alpha 211264 CPUs, ALI m1631,
Digital Tsunami, AMD 760, AMD 760MP, Intel 440BX, Intel 440GX, VIA
VT8601, SiS540, SiS550, SiS630 and SiS730 chipsets. And this is
just the code that has been finished and placed in the main
LinuxBIOS tree. Other ports are still in progress and haven't been
committed as of this writing. So while the hardware support is
limited, the list is growing. LinuxBIOS currently is not tied to
any specific chipset, vendor or processor architecture.</p><p>The quality of the hardware support varies. On the chipset
front, support for SiS chipsets is very good. Both Intel and AMD
have a standard policy of documenting their chipsets so the support
at both is pretty good. Via does not publicly document their newer
chipsets, making support here a challenge.</p><p>On the processor front, Compaq has made the important details
public, so supporting Alpha processors is doable. Development for
the Alpha has not been a high priority, however, because the Alpha
is an expensive processor with a dubious future.</p><p>The Pentium II and Pentium III are fairly well documented in
Intel manuals, except for the L2 cache initialization of their slot
processors (the L2 cache initialization is now supported). The AMD
Athlon and Duron are not well supported because AMD hasn't publicly
documented everything that needs to be set up for their
processors.</p><p>Support from the board manufacturer isn't necessary because,
most of the time, components on a motherboard can be identified by
just looking at it.</p><p>Board manufacturers generally are interested in supporting
only one firmware for their motherboards. As LinuxBIOS currently
does not provide a compatibility layer for booting other operating
systems besides Linux (notably Windows), there hasn't been much
interest from board manufacturers in deploying LinuxBIOS in its
current form.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2743580.0x283c6e0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>LinuxBIOS provides an innovative look at the job of firmware,
how it is structured, written and licensed. As machines become
increasingly integrated, LinuxBIOS is rising to meet the demand for
greater code reuse and flexibility. If the snowballing interest in
the technology is any indication, it looks to have a bright
future.</p><p><a href="4888s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
