    An excerpt from our French chef's recently published book.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a2580.0x229a608"></a></h2></div></div><p>By the time you get this issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, my new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
System Administration: A User's Guide</em></span>, will have hit the
shelves. Because they are just so darn cool, the folks at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> have given me some space in this
month's issue to give you a teaser from the book.
</p><p>Being the kind of guy that I am, I ached over what to present
while trying to keep it short. After all, there's so much to choose
from. Setting up a scanner? A CD writer? Blocking unwanted access
to your network? Printing? Backups? Sendmail tweaks? What? In the
end, I decided to talk about something that doesn't get enough
press in today's internet world, and that's good old-fashioned user
security. What you are about to read is an excerpt from Chapter
Seven of the book, &ldquo;Users and Groups&rdquo;. It is not the complete
chapter, nor are all the pieces in order. &ldquo;The chef has been
sipping too much of his own wine&rdquo;, you say? Not at all. In fact,
like my alter ego, I wanted to use this space to give you a sample,
a taste if you will, of what you might find in the pages of my new
book. Think of it as nibbling from a buffet table. As Chef Marcel
would say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon app&eacute;tit</em></span>!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a2580.0x229a8c8"></a>Living in a Multiuser World</h2></div></div><p>Linux is a multiuser operating system, meaning that one or
more users can work on it at the same time. Every user is
referenced by their user name. Each user name has a user ID (UID)
associated with it and one or more groups. Like user names, group
names are also represented by a numeric identifier, this time
called a group ID (GID). A user's UID is unique as is a group's
GID.</p><p>When it comes to your files and directories, security on a
Linux system is defined by means of permissions, which directly
relate to the user ID. Users are either administrative users or
regular users. The chief administrative user is called root. A
user's ID is used to decide what commands can be executed and what
files can be read from or written to.</p><p>Each user ID also has a password associated with it. That
password can and should be changed on a regular basis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a2580.0x229aa80"></a>When Not to Use the Root User</h2></div></div><p>The short answer here is that you should never use the root
user unless you absolutely have to. The danger lies in the fact
that the root user is virtually omnipotent on the system. A mistake
can have serious implications that can wipe out your entire system.
Unless you absolutely have to, it is best to work as a
nonadministrative user. There are other reasons as well.</p><p>The first is security. Because the root user has access to
everything, it makes sense that only those who really need to have
access are given the root password. The fewer people who have
access to root, the better. Let me give you a few good reasons for
jealously guarding root access: it makes it easier to maintain
security, it decreases the risk of dangerous code and errors do not
(usually) have global implications. Yes, it is still possible for a
nonroot user to do great damage to a system, but the risk is much,
much smaller.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a2580.0x229abe0"></a>Checking the Password File</h2></div></div><p>As if you didn't already have enough things to do, here's yet
another job. On a regular basis, you should run a report to
identify accounts or logins that have gone dormant. This is a nice
way of saying &ldquo;people who are gone and who are not coming back
anytime soon&rdquo;.</p><p>An earlier chapter of the book explains the finger command,
which displays information relating to the last time an account was
used. Try typing this command to list each user ID and to check the
last login time. Note that the single quotes (just before the sort
command and just before the pipe symbol) are actually back quotes
(or back ticks). The back quote is usually found with the tilde (~)
just under the Esc key on most keyboards.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
finger 'sort /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d":"' | grep -i log | more
</pre><p>The output of this command looks something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">

<span   class="bold"><b>Warning:</b></span> you must use your good
judgment (an absolute requirement for system administration) on
this one. Some of these accounts&mdash;sync and lp, for instance&mdash;are
system accounts. It only makes sense that no one will have ever
logged in through them. On the other hand, Mr. Einstein (at the top
of the list) has never logged in either and his is certainly not an
administrative login. It could be that this is a new account (and
it is) or that you created an account for a user that never was
used. In the latter case, you should probably get rid of that
account.
</p><p>Now, I used that example to give you a feel for your
command-line prowess. However, I should tell you that there is a
cleaner way to do this. Your Linux system comes with a handy little
command called lastlog that does just this sort of thing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>Geek trivia:</b></span> you can't edit
or modify this file, but the lastlog command information comes from
the file /var/log/lastlog.
</p><p>Here is another thing you should do. Every once in a while,
run the command pwck. By default, it walks through your /etc/passwd
and /etc/shadow files and does some basic integrity checks, such as
making sure that the right number of fields are present and that
each name is uniquely identified. For the group file, there is a
companion command called grpck.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a2580.0x229b058"></a>How Crackers Crack Your Passwords</h2></div></div><p>The reason for a good password goes right back to my
description of the password file earlier in the book, specifically
as it relates to the password field in nonshadow files. Here's a
quick reminder of the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
root:2IsjW45pb4L56:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre><p>The password field (field 2) is encoded by virtue of a
hashing algorithm. If you are curious as to the gory details, type
&lt;@cxb&gt;man crypt&lt;@$p&gt; and you'll find everything you
ever wanted to know about encoding passwords. The short form is
this: that strange password is actually a coded version of your
password based on a two-character, randomly generated salt. This
salt is then used to seed the hashing routine to generate the final
group of characters.
</p><p>The term hashing represents a technique for taking a string
of characters (a person's last name, for instance) and generating a
unique key (ideally) for easy retrieval of the information from a
database. What you are doing is encoding the normal text into a
shorter, (usually) numeric representation.</p><p>Password crackers figure out passwords by using that salt to
generate passwords against every word in the dictionary. While this
sounds pretty complex, it's not. A simple program calls the crypt
routine, runs the hash on a word and then compares it to the
password entry in the /etc/passwd file. If it matches, bingo! They
have your password. If it doesn't, they move on to the next word.
On a reasonably punchy system, it doesn't take all that long for
crackers to work their way through every password in the
book.</p><p>Don't believe me? Take a look at the output in Figure 1 from
a little program called Nutcracker, a freeware tool that does the
kind of brute-force password checking I was talking about.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4851f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Why Dictionary Wofrds Make Bad Passwords
</p></div></div><p>As you can see in Figure 1, picking something you'll remember
easily because it is a common word is a bad choice for a
password.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a2580.0x229b528"></a>I Logged in from Where?</h2></div></div><p>Have a look at what happens when I log in to a machine.
Everything looks normal. I have a login name, a request for my
password. I enter the password and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>, I am in. But hold on&mdash;read that
little one-line message that appears after I enter the
password:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
login: mgagne
Password:
Last login: Mon Jan  8 16:00:39 from energize
</pre><p>What the heck is &ldquo;energize&rdquo;? Energize is the hostname of
the computer from which I last logged in apparently, except I don't
have a system called energize. Furthermore, let's pretend that I
don't know anyone with that system and I always log in from the
same place. The only explanation is that somebody from a system
called energize logged in to the server with my login name and
password.
</p><p>This is just a hypothetical situation, but it does illustrate
one other habit that you should consider training your users to
adopt. If they are logging in from the same PC day in and day out,
that message should never change. If they do not recognize the
hostname in the last login message, they should make it a policy to
alert you.</p><p>Security isn't just the domain of the system administrator.
After all, you've got plenty on your hands. Any help is
appreciated. You need to get the users involved. Let them know that
system security is their business as well as yours.</p><p><a href="4851s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
