Business Platform</h2></div></div><p>On September 25, 2001, the research firm D.H. Brown released
a study that went a long way toward legitimizing Linux as a serious
business platform and not just a handy way to serve up web pages
and perform other low-level business grunt work. The report
begins:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For the first time since D.H. Brown Associates,
Inc. began studying the functional capabilities of Linux-based
operating systems, the strongest Linux distributions surpass the
weakest UNIX systems in overall functionality. Using the version
2.4 Linux kernel has improved the features of the operating system.
In addition, all of the vendors studied&mdash;SuSE, Red Hat, Caldera,
Turbolinux and Debian GNU&mdash;have increased the breadth and depth of
their bundled network infrastructure software.</p></blockquote></div><p>The report analyzed scalability, RAS (reliability,
availability, serviceability), system management, internet and
web-application services, and directory and security services.
&ldquo;With these upgrades in place, the leading distributions of Linux
are able to serve as general-purpose operating systems for a wide
range of departmental and workgroup applications.&rdquo; The graphic
below shows how the various distributions stacked up.

Overall Functional Ratings
</p></div></div>

</p><p>In a 1999 study, D.H. Brown articulated the prevailing
business wisdom about Linux at the time: &ldquo;that Linux was primarily
suited for low-end web, file and print service, along with use in
appliance servers and clustering for high-performance technical
computing.&rdquo; Now, the company says, &ldquo;the leading Linux
distributions are quite capable of serving as general-purpose
operating systems for a broad range of departmental and workgroup
applications.&rdquo;</p><p>Where Linux fell short of the top UNIX systems, the report
said, was in areas &ldquo;such as high-end shared memory multiprocessing
(SMP) scalability and advanced reliability features [which] require
a degree of close coordination between hardware and software
designers that has not yet emerged in the Linux community&rdquo;. The
report adds, however, that &ldquo;the gap between Linux and these UNIX
systems has certainly closed at a rapid pace.&rdquo;</p><p>For more information, visit

close attention to Linux, and the practice continues. In the past
we've run occasional snapshots of one month's download percentages.
This time we're looking at the six-month download trend running
through August 2001 (see Figure 1).</p><p>Mandrake has been a steady leader, with Red Hat a strong
second (though with a somewhat downward trend over the
period).</p><p>As we see from the huge spike in SuSE downloads in May 2001,
a six-month total tends to even out any one month's extreme
results. Still, it's easy to ponder that SuSE spike: it was over
1.2 million downloads.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5500tucowsf1.large.jpg"><img src="5500tucowsf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

the whole six-month period, showing the top ten distributions.
While there is a clear break below the Big Five shown in the trend
chart, the Brazilian CONECTIVA distro is an interesting standout
contender.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5500tucowsf2.large.jpg"><img src="5500tucowsf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
