    Marcel shows you how to view the strange world of Linux in exciting new ways using fsv, 3dfile and XCruise.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x22ab608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, I am impressed. When I asked you to select a wine
with depth, I must admit that while I had complete confidence in
you, this time I am truly pleased. The 1997
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Volnay-Santenots du Milieu</em></span> is a wonderful
choice. Please make sure that you bring back enough for our guests.
I am expecting them shortly. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>,
Fran&ccedil;ois.
</p><p>But they are already here! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bienvenue, mes
amis</em></span>. Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home
of fine Linux cuisine. Please sit. Fran&ccedil;ois is down in the
cellar fetching the wine. You know, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
I constantly am amazed when I think of the parallels between good
food and wine and cooking with Linux. Take this month's issue for
instance...ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have made good time. Please
open the wine and serve our guests.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci</em></span>.</p><p>Just as a good restaurateur becomes one with their wine
cellar, so does a good administrator become one with their system.
Every directory and every file is as familiar to the system
administrator as their own hand. Of course, in terms of
visualization, I have had an advantage with the wine cellar. From
time to time, I wander its cool halls, letting its bottles, labels
and smells fill my senses. However, as Linux system administrators,
we have been forced to imagine this world. But today, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, all that changes. Today, your Linux system becomes
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>place</em></span>. With the help of a few open-source
recipes, your filesystem is about to enter the third
dimension.</p><p>The first item on today's menu is a little something
innocently called fsv (filesystem viewer), a concoction by Daniel
Richard. When you fire up this little program, it scans your entire
filesystem (relative to your position in the filesystem's
hierarchy) and provides you with a new and unique view of what you
will find there. Suddenly, files and directories appear as cubes of
varying heights like buildings in a strange city. Click on a
directory and you can zoom in to that directory and explore the
&ldquo;city&rdquo; beneath it. It offers two different visualization modes: a
map view and a tree view. The tree view is interesting in that
directories now appear like skyscrapers in a fantastic, cyber city.
Figure 1 shows fsv in action.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5504f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This Is the City&mdash;Your Filesystem in fsv
</p></div></div><p>You can get fsv from
<a href="http://fsv.sourceforge.net" target="_self">fsv.sourceforge.net</a>.
You will need a couple of things to start, such as OpenGL or Mesa,
GTK+ (both of which are probably already installed on your system
or are as close as your distribution CD), as well as Janne
L&ouml;f's GtkGLArea OpenGL widget set for GTK+, available at
<a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea" target="_self">www.student.oulu.fi/~jlof/gtkglarea</a>.
If you are running an RPM-based distribution, you also can find
various precompiled packages on
<a href="http://www.rpmfind.net" target="_self">www.rpmfind.net</a>. But I
digress, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>Extract the source and build as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf fsv-0.9.tar.gz
cd fsv-0.9
make
make install
</pre><p>In order to run the program, you simply type
<b  >fsv</b>. Depending on your starting directory, this
may take a few seconds. You also can specify the starting directory
on the command line if you wish. For instance, if you wanted to
start at your Linux kernel source, you would type the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fsv /usr/src/linux
</pre>


Daniel is not the only one with a three-dimensional vision of his
Linux system. Another interesting project is aptly named 3dfile.
Once again, the 3-D visualization comes to us courtesy of OpenGL or
Mesa and Mircea Mitu.
</p><p>As Mircea Mitu is quick to point out, 3dfile is not quite a
file manager, although it does do some pretty cool things (besides
rocking representational icons back and forth). For instance, if
you click on a red block (these represent executable files), you
will launch that application. I fired up a game of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Maelstrom</em></span> that way and wasted far too much
time. Here's something else to try: right-click on a filename and a
small pop-up menu will appear. If you happen to be looking at a
text file, you can view the file as text. The other viewing option
is hex, a great way to impress your nontechnical friends. Open up a
file in the hex viewer, study it carefully and say something like
&ldquo;Ah, there's the problem.&rdquo; System administrators need to keep the
magic alive, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>Have a look at Figure 2, and then we shall toss this little
recipe together and get 3dfile working for you.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5504f2.large.jpg"><img src="5504f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Rocking File Blocks with 3dfile
</p></div></div><p>You'll need to visit
<a href="http://web.ss.pub.ro/~mms/3dfile" target="_self">web.ss.pub.ro/~mms/3dfile</a>
to pick up your copy of the source. The installation is quite
straightforward as well, but does have one interesting first step
before the nearly traditional ./configure:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf 3dfile-0.1.8.tar.gz
cd 3dfile.0.1.8
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>Running the program is as easy as typing
<b  >3dfile</b>. I found working with 3dfile to be quite
intuitive. The only thing that may not be immediately apparent is
that row of buttons at the bottom. Run your crosshairs over these
and you'll find navigation even easier.
</p><p>The next item on our menu offers another way of looking at
the system. Leander Seige's TDFSB is interesting in that it lets
you wander through an OpenGL-generated filesystem with a rather
enjoyable twist. Directories hover as silver spheres upon a
floating grid landscape. What I find really interesting here
becomes apparent when you happen upon a graphic or image file. The
image is rendered as a three-dimensional image around which you can
move. Have a look at Figure 3 for a peek at TDFSB in action.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5504f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The 3-D Landscape of TDFSB Revealed
</p></div></div><p>Building TDFSB is not complicated, but I warn you that
Leander's source does not provide an elegant means of compiling the
program. The README does contain just about everything you'll need
to compile on your system, and it is very, very short. Please read
it. In a moment, I will show you what I did to make it run on my
system.</p><p>Start by visiting the TDFSB site and picking up the source.
TDFSB's home is at
<a href="http://www.hgb-leipzig.de/~leander/TDFSB" target="_self">www.hgb-leipzig.de/~leander/TDFSB</a>.
The only other thing I needed was the gdk-pixbuf image library
(part of GNOME):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf tdfsb.tgz
cd tdfsb
</pre><p>This is where you have to look at your README. From that, I
created the following, single-line install script. Please note that
while the text wraps, it is one line. It essentially was created by
cutting and pasting from that README file. Ah, yes, the system I
tested this on was a notebook running Red Hat 7.1:
<pre     class="programlisting">
        gcc -L/usr/X11R6/lib -I./ -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lXmu
            -lXi -lXext -lX11 -lm -lgdk_pixbuf -march=i686
            -malign-loops=4 -malign-jumps=4 -malign-functions=4
            -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strength-reduce
            -x c -o tdfsb tdb3.c -I/usr/include/gdk-pixbuf
            -I/usr/include/glib-1.2 -I/usr/include/gtk-1.2
            -I/usr/lib/glib/include
</pre>


Now, run the program by typing <b  >./tdfsb</b>. To get a
little floating, heads-up display help menu, type
<b  >h</b>. Since your mouse is the means by which you
navigate this world, you can toggle its release by typing the
letter <b  >r</b>. The system on which I tested did not
have 3-D acceleration hardware, but there is little doubt that you
could benefit from a nice, fast video card when using TDFSB.
</p><p>Ah, I see that closing time is approaching. But before you
go, allow me to share a final and quite different way of looking at
your systems. Those friends of ours who are new to Linux have, from
time to time, been heard to remark that Linux is like a strange new
world. The tools we have just explored demonstrate some of the many
fascinating faces this world can have.</p><p>But &ldquo;world&rdquo;? How about solar system? How about galaxy? This
is without a doubt what Yusuke Shinyama had in mind when creating
XCruise. This great little package is a file manager of sorts, one
that lets you navigate your disk as though it were a universe all
its own. Each filesystem is a galaxy, files are stars (the bigger
the file, the bigger the star) and symbolic links are wormholes.
Your humble chef and his faithful waiter have been known to spend a
great deal of time navigating their respective Linux systems in
this way.</p><p>Anxious to launch into your own private universe? Have a look
at Figure 4, then cruise on over to
<a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/pub" target="_self">www.unixuser.org/~euske/pub/</a>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5504f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Cruising the /etc Galaxy with XCruise
</p></div></div><p>Building the package is simplicity itself. Just follow this
basic recipe and you are almost ready for launch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf xcruise-0.24.tar.gz
cd xcruise-0.24
xmkmf
make
</pre><p>The resulting binary is sitting there in the directory and
can be copied to wherever you like. To run the program, type
<b  >./xcruise &amp;</b>. You may find that the default
incarnation of XCruise is a bit large for your screen. Luckily, you
also can use X geometry settings to change the size to something
more suitable to your display. For instance, my notebook has an
1024 x 768 display, but I only want to have XCruise fill an 800 x
600 area. To do this, I start the program this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
./xcruise -geometry 800x600+0+0
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>Magnifique</em></span>! Using my left mouse button, I
travel forward at incredible speeds while the middle button (or
both buttons on a two-button mouse) lets me move out and back. The
scroll keys let me vary my angle and direction. Ah, this Linux
universe is rich and exciting, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
</p><p>Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Once again, it is closing
time. Time for Fran&ccedil;ois to fill your glasses a final time
and for us to return to the real world, a world, that after today,
you may never see the same way again. Until next time; <span   class="emphasis"><em>au
revoir</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Your table will
be waiting.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;</em></span>! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon
