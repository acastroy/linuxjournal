Apache is the most popular Web server and one of the most successful
open-source projects of all time. Since April 1996, Apache has served
more Web sites than any other Web server. Many of the world's largest
Web sites, including YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia and Craigslist,
use Apache to serve billions of page views per month. Over the years,
Apache has proven itself to be a very stable, secure and configurable
Web server. Although Apache is an excellent Web server, what if there
were an alternative with the same functionality, a simpler configuration
and better performance? That Web server exists, and it's called Nginx.
</p><p>
Nginx, pronounced &ldquo;Engine X&rdquo;, is a high-performance Web server and reverse
proxy. It was created by Igor Sysoev for <a href="http://www.rambler.ru" target="_self">www.rambler.ru</a>,
Russia's second-largest Web site. Rambler has used Nginx since summer 2004, and it's
currently serving about 500 million requests per day. Like Apache, Nginx
is used by some of the largest Web sites in the US, including WordPress
(#26), YouPorn (#27), Hulu and MochiMedia. As of May 2008, Nginx is the
fourth-most-popular Web server, and it is currently serving more than two
million Web sites. As it is only trailing behind Apache, IIS and GFE,
it is effectively the second-most-popular Web server available for Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15cd568"></a>
Why Use Nginx?</h2></div></div><p>
Like Apache, Nginx has all the features you would expect from a leading
Web server:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Static file serving.
</p></li><li><p>
SSL/TLS support.
</p></li><li><p>
Virtual hosts.
</p></li><li><p>
Reverse proxying.
</p></li><li><p>
Load balancing.
</p></li><li><p>
Compression.
</p></li><li><p>
Access controls.
</p></li><li><p>
URL rewriting.
</p></li><li><p>
Custom logging.
</p></li><li><p>
Server-side includes.
</p></li><li><p>
WebDAV.
</p></li><li><p>
FLV streaming.
</p></li><li><p>
FastCGI.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It is stable, secure and very easy to configure, as you will see later
in the article. However, the main advantages of Nginx over Apache are
performance and efficiency.
</p><p>
I ran a simple test against Nginx v0.5.22 and Apache v2.2.8 using ab
(Apache's benchmarking tool). During the tests, I monitored the system with
vmstat and top. The results indicate that Nginx outperforms Apache when
serving static content. Both servers performed best with a concurrency
of 100. Apache used four worker processes (threaded mode), 30% CPU and
17MB of memory to serve 6,500 requests per second. Nginx used one worker,
15% CPU and 1MB of memory to serve 11,500 requests per second.
</p><p>
Nginx is able to serve more requests per second with less resources
because of its architecture. It consists of a master process, which
delegates work to one or more worker processes. Each worker handles
multiple requests in an event-driven or asynchronous manner using special
functionality from the Linux kernel (epoll/select/poll). This allows
Nginx to handle a large number of concurrent requests quickly with
very little overhead. Apache can be configured to use either a process
per request (pre-fork) or a thread for each request (worker). Although
Apache's threaded mode performs much better than its pre-fork mode,
it still uses more memory and CPU than Nginx's event-driven architecture.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15ce118"></a>
Installation and Basic Usage</h2></div></div><p>
Nginx is available in most Linux distributions. For this article, I
use Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy), which includes Nginx version 0.5.33. If your
distro does not have Nginx, or if you want to run a newer version,
you always can download the latest stable version (v0.6.31 at the time of this
writing)
and install from source.
</p><p>
Run the following command as root to install Nginx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# apt-get install nginx
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that Nginx is installed, you can use the startup script to start,
stop or restart the Web server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/init.d/nginx start
# /etc/init.d/nginx stop
# /etc/init.d/nginx restart 
</pre>
</p><p>
Most configuration changes do not require a restart, in which case you
can use the reload command. It is generally a good idea to test the
Nginx configuration file for errors before reloading:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# nginx -t
# /etc/init.d/nginx reload
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's go ahead and start the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/init.d/nginx start
</pre>
</p><p>
Nginx now should be running on your machine. If you open http://127.0.0.1/
in your browser, you should see a page with &ldquo;Welcome to nginx!&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15ce590"></a>
Main Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
Now that Nginx is installed, let's take a look at its config file, 
located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. This file contains the server-wide
settings for Nginx, and it should look similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user www-data;
worker_processes  1;
error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;
pid  /var/run/nginx.pid;
events {
  worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
  include  /etc/nginx/mime.types;
  default_type  application/octet-stream;
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log;
  sendfile  on;
  keepalive_timeout  65;
  tcp_nodelay  on;
  gzip  on;
  include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
We are not going to change any of these settings, but let's talk about
some of them to help us understand how Nginx works. The worker_processes
setting tells Nginx how many child processes to start. If your server
has more than one processor or is performing large amounts of disk
IO, you might want to try increasing this number to see if you get
better performance. The worker_connections setting limits the number
of concurrent connections per worker process. To determine the maximum
number of concurrent requests, you simply multiply worker_processes
by worker_connections.
</p><p>
The error_log and access_log settings indicate the default logging
locations. You also can configure these settings on a per-site basis,
as you will see later in the article. Like Apache, Nginx is configured
to run as the www-data user, but you easily can change this with the user
setting. The startup script for Nginx needs to know the process ID for
the master process, which is stored in /var/run/nginx.pid, as indicated
by the pid setting.
</p><p>
The sendfile setting allows Nginx to use a special Linux system call
to send a file over the network in a very efficient manner. The gzip
option instructs Nginx to compress each response, which uses more
CPU but saves bandwidth and decreases response time. Additionally,
Nginx provides another compression module called gzip precompression
(available as of version 0.6.24). This module looks for a compressed
copy of the file with a .gz extension in the same location and serves
it to gzip-enabled clients. This prevents having to compress the file
each time it's requested.
</p><p>
The last setting we are concerned with is the include directive for
the sites-enabled directory. Inside /etc/nginx, you'll see two other
directories, /etc/nginx/sites-available and /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. For
each Web site you want to host with Nginx, you should create a
config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available, then create a symlink
in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled that points to the config file you
created. The main Nginx config file includes all the files in
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled. This helps organize your configuration files
and makes it very easy to enable and disable specific Web sites.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15ce850"></a>
Static Web Server</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we covered the main configuration file, let's create a config
file for a basic Web site. Before we begin, we need to disable the
default site that Ubuntu created for us:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, create a new configuration file called
/etc/nginx/sites-available/basic with the following contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
  listen  127.0.0.1:80;
  server_name  basic;
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/basic.access.log;
  error_log  /var/log/nginx/basic.error.log;
  location  / {
    root  /var/www/basic;
    index  index.html index.htm;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Create the root directory and index.html file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /var/www/basic
# cd /var/www/basic
# echo "Basic Web Site" &gt; index.html
</pre>
</p><p>
Enable the site and restart Nginx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
# ln -s ../sites-available/basic . 
# /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>
</p><p>
If you open http://127.0.0.1/ in your browser, you should see a page with
&ldquo;Basic Web Site&rdquo;. As you can see, it is very easy to create a new site
using Nginx.
</p><p>
Let's go over the new configuration file we created. The server directive
is used to define a new virtual server, and all of its settings are
enclosed in braces. The listen directive indicates the IP and port
on which this server will accept requests, and server_name sets the
hostname for your virtual server. As I mentioned earlier, the access_log
and error_log settings can be set on a per-site basis. It is usually a
good idea to provide each site with its own set of log files.
</p><p>
Next is the location directive, which allows you to modify the
settings for different parts of your site. In our case, we have
only one location for the entire site. However, you can have multiple
location directives, and you can use regular expressions to define
them. We have two other directives inside our location block: root and
index. The root directive is used to define the document root for this
location. This means a request for /img/test.gif would look for the
file /var/www/localhost/img/test.gif. Finally, the index directive
tells Nginx what files to use as the default file for this location.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15c55b0"></a>
Static Web Server with SSL</h2></div></div><p>
Some Web sites, such as on-line stores, require secure communication
(HTTPS) to protect credit-card transactions and customer information.
Like
Apache, Nginx supports HTTPS via an SSL module, and it's very easy
to set up.
</p><p>
First, you need to generate an SSL certificate. The openssl command will
ask you a bunch of questions, but you simply can press Enter for each one:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# apt-get install openssl
# mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
# cd /etc/nginx/ssl
# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
</pre>
</p><p>
Create a new config file called /etc/nginx/sites-available/secure, which
contains the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
  listen   127.0.0.1:443;
  server_name  secure;
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/secure.access.log;
  error_log  /var/log/nginx/secure.error.log;
  ssl on;
  ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;  
  ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;  
  location / {
    root   /var/www/secure;
    index  index.html index.htm;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Create the root directory and index.html file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /var/www/secure
# cd /var/www/secure
# echo "Secure Web Site" &gt; index.html
</pre>
</p><p>
Enable the site and restart Nginx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
# ln -s ../sites-available/secure . 
# /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>
</p><p>
If you open https://127.0.0.1/ in your browser (note the https),
you probably will get a warning about not being able to verify the
certificate. That's because we are using a self-signed certificate for
this example. Go ahead and tell your browser to accept the certificate,
and you should see a page with &ldquo;Secure Web Site&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This config file is very similar to our previous config, but there
are a few differences. First, notice that this new server is listening
on port 443, which is the standard port for HTTPS. Second, we enabled
the SSL module with the line <tt  >ssl on;</tt>. If you compiled Nginx yourself
instead of using the Ubuntu package, you need to make sure you specified
<tt  >--with-http_ssl_module</tt> when you ran
<tt  >./configure</tt>; otherwise, the SSL
module will not be available. Third, we used the ssl_certificate and
ssl_certificate_key directives to point to the certificate and key we
created earlier.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15c5c38"></a>
Virtual Hosting</h2></div></div><p>
In many cases, you will want to run multiple Web sites from a single
server. This is called virtual hosting, and Nginx supports both IP- and
name-based vhosts.
</p><p>
Let's create two virtual hosts: one.example.com and two.example.com. First,
we need to add a line to our /etc/hosts file, so that one.example.com
and two.example.com point to our server (normally you would do this
using DNS):


<pre     class="programlisting">
# echo "127.0.0.1 one.example.com two.example.com" &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we need to create a configuration file for each site. First, create
a file called /etc/nginx/sites-available/one with the following contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server {
  listen   127.0.0.1:80;
  server_name  one.example.com;
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/one.access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/one.error.log;
  location / {
    root   /var/www/one;
    index  index.html index.htm;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, make a copy of that file called /etc/nginx/sites-available/two, and
replace each occurrence of &ldquo;one&rdquo; with &ldquo;two&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
# cp one two
# sed -i "s/one/two/" two
</pre>
</p><p>
Create the root directories and index.html files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /var/www/{one,two}
# echo "Site 1" &gt; /var/www/one/index.html
# echo "Site 2" &gt; /var/www/two/index.html
</pre>
</p><p>
Enable the sites and restart Nginx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
# ln -s ../sites-available/one .
# ln -s ../sites-available/two .
# /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>
</p><p>
If you open http://one.example.com/ in your browser, you should see a
page with &ldquo;Site 1&rdquo;. For http://two.example.com/, you should see
&ldquo;Site 2&rdquo;.
</p><p>
We just created two name-based virtual hosts running on 127.0.0.1 by
changing the server_name directive. For IP-based virtual hosts, simply
change the listen directive to use a different IP for each site.
</p><p>
Now, go ahead and disable these two virtual hosts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/one
# rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/two
# /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't forget to remove the line we added to /etc/hosts when you are done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14d5580.0x15c6420"></a>
Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to being an extremely fast static Web server, Nginx also
is a load balancer and reverse proxy. A load balancer is a device used to
spread work out across multiple servers or processes, and a reverse
proxy is a server that transparently hands off requests to another
server. Among other things, this allows Nginx to handle requests for
static content and to load-balance requests for dynamic content across
many different back-end servers or processes.
</p><p>
For this example, let's create a very simple Python Web server
to serve up some dynamic content. Don't worry if you are not familiar
with Python; we're just using it to display a Web page that indicates
on which port the server is running. Save the following to a file called
/tmp/server.py:


<pre     class="programlisting">
import sys,BaseHTTPServer as B
class Handler(B.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
  def do_GET(self):
    self.wfile.write("Served from port %s" % port)
  def log_message(self, *args):
    pass
if __name__ == '__main__':
  host,port = sys.argv[1:3]
  server = B.HTTPServer((host,int(port)), Handler)
  server.serve_forever()
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we can start two of these local servers, each on a different port:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# python /tmp/server.py 127.0.0.1 8001 &amp;
# python /tmp/server.py 127.0.0.1 8002 &amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you open http://127.0.0.1:8001/ in your browser, you should see &ldquo;Served
from port 8001&rdquo;, and if you open http://127.0.0.1:8002/, you should see
&ldquo;Served from port 8002&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, create a new configuration file called
/etc/nginx/sites-available/proxy with the following contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
upstream python_servers {
  server 127.0.0.1:8001;
  server 127.0.0.1:8002;
}
server {
  listen   127.0.0.1:8000;
  server_name  proxy;
  access_log  /var/log/nginx/proxy.access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/proxy.error.log;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://python_servers;
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Enable the site and restart Nginx:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
# ln -s ../sites-available/proxy .
# /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre>
</p><p>
If you open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, you should see a
page with either &ldquo;Served from port 8001&rdquo; or &ldquo;Served from port
8002&rdquo;,
and it should alternate each time you refresh the page.
</p><p>
Let's go over some of these new settings. The upstream block defines a
name for a group of back-end servers. In our case, we defined a group
named python_servers, which contains the two local Python servers
we started on port 8001 and 8002. We then configured Nginx to hand
off all requests to our back-end servers with the line <tt  >proxy_pass
http://python_servers;</tt>. Nginx automatically load-balances the requests to
each Python server in a round-robin manner. You also can set weights for
each back end, so you can direct more or fewer requests to specific servers.
</p><p>
Nginx handles back-end failures automatically and will stop sending
requests to a failed back-end server until it starts responding again. To
demonstrate this, we can kill off the Python process that's running on
port 8001. Use the jobs command to find the job number for the Python
process running on port 8001, and use <tt  >kill %&lt;job
number&gt;</tt> to kill
the process:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# jobs
# kill %1
</pre>
</p><p>
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser and keep refreshing the page,
you should see only the &ldquo;Served from port 8002&rdquo; page. Nginx detected that
the back-end server from port 8001 was not responding, so it stopped sending
requests to that server. Now, restart the Python process for port 8001:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# python /tmp/server.py 127.0.0.1 8001 &amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
Keep refreshing the page and you should see your browser start alternating
between &ldquo;Served from port 8001&rdquo; and &ldquo;Served from port
8002&rdquo; again. Nginx
detected that the port 8001 back end was responding and began sending
requests to it.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Whether you are looking to get the most out of your VPS or are attempting
to scale one of the largest Web sites in the world, Nginx may be the
best tool for the job. It's fast, stable and easy to use. Thanks to
Igor Sysoev for creating this excellent piece of software.
