When was the last time you heard someone mention
the browser wars? Most pundits love to point out that Internet Explorer's
only real competition is Mozilla Firefox. One or two will give Opera a
nod. But, what about the underdogs of the browser world?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1668580.0x1760408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Speed of lightning, power of thunder? What is this I hear? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon
Dieu</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois! How on earth did you find that old
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Underdog</em></span> clip? Ah,
of course&mdash;YouTube. I am surprised, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span> that
you even know
about this old cartoon&mdash;one, I confess, I enjoyed a great deal in my
youth. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You don't know it? You were just doing
some research
for the issue's theme, underdogs? To be honest, I'm not exactly
sure what our editors meant, but I don't think rescuing Sweet Polly Purebred
from the evil Simon Bar Sinister was what they had in mind. Underdogs,
Fran&ccedil;ois, refer to people (or animals or things) who are disadvantaged
in some way. They may be smaller and not quite as strong as their opponent,
so that in a contest or fight, they are expected to lose. People love
to see the underdog win. But enough of this, Fran&ccedil;ois. Our guests are
arriving as we speak.
</p><p>
Welcome once again, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, where fine wine is
a naturally perfect match for fine Linux and open-source software. Please,
take your seats and make yourselves comfortable while my faithful waiter
attends to the wine. Fran&ccedil;ois, please head down to the cellar and bring
back that 2006 Torbreck Barossa Valley Woodcutter's Shiraz we were,
uhm, submitting to quality control earlier today.
</p><p>
Before you arrived, Fran&ccedil;ois and I were discussing the meaning of
the word underdog. Cartoon characters aside, in the desktop Web browser
world,
you will find some true underdogs. I'm not talking about Firefox, and
I'm sure most people no longer see Firefox as an underdog when compared
to the Redmond OS's flagship browser. Instead, I want to show you some
Web browsers worthy of the underdog label that you may well want to
consider using. Despite not being as feature-rich as the heavyweights,
these lightweight browsers have small memory footprints, make few demands
on system resources and are, in many cases, as fast as lightning. Let
me start with a text-only browser that, strangely enough, does graphics.
</p><p>
Links, created by Mikulas Patocka, is a text-only Web browser
that is surprisingly rich in features (Figure 1). It can display tables
and frames, and it supports colors, clickable links, SSL pages, background
downloads and more. Sure, it works in text, but you have never seen pages
load as quickly as you will when you decide to view the World Wide Web the
way many of us first saw it&mdash;sans pictures. People doing research
who want uncluttered information need to put away their graphical
browsers and fire up Links. The effect of seeing only what you need, loaded
in an instant, is a wonderful experience. Once you have used it, you
always will make sure it is loaded on every Linux distribution you run.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f1.large.jpg"><img src="10160f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Links is a perennial favorite
for text-only Web browsing. When you can't get to a graphical desktop,
nothing beats Links.
</p></div></div><p>
Links' popularity means you don't have to look far for it. Most
distributions have it in their repositories. Source is, of course,
available
from <a href="http://links.sourceforge.net" target="_self">links.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p><p>
Although it's true that Links is a text browser, it does respond
to mouse clicks. In a nongraphical environment, you navigate by using
cursor keys, jump from link to link with the Tab key, page using the
spacebar and follow a link by pressing Enter. In a text console running
under
a graphical desktop, things are a little different. When you see a link,
simply click, and you will go there.
</p><p>
Did I say text-only? I may have been mistaken. Graphically speaking,
Links isn't merely a text browser. An update to Links, available
from Twibright labs at <a href="http://links.twibright.com" target="_self">links.twibright.com</a>, provides
a
graphical interface that works even if you aren't running a graphical
desktop. That's right. This Links will work on your framebuffer console
as well (Figure 2). Once again, you should have no trouble finding
the package in your repositories. The difference is in the command. To
run the text-only version of Links, use the command
<tt  >links</tt>. For a graphical
version of Links, try <tt  >links-graphic</tt>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f2.large.jpg"><img src="10160f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. If you
thought Links was a text-only browser, think again.
</p></div></div><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned. Please pour for our guests. Enjoy,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. This Shiraz has a wonderfully rich aroma,
complexity and texture, along with black cherry draped over the signature
Shiraz
peppery flavor. Make sure you fill my glass as well, Fran&ccedil;ois.
</p><p>
Another alternative to the monster browsers of today, and one that is
entirely graphical in nature, is Dillo. Created by Jorge Arellano
Cid, Dillo's demands on your system are meager, and its performance is
seriously snappy. It won't render complex pages or tables particularly
well, but it does support image browsing and bookmarks. Dillo's small
size, speed and tiny memory footprint can sometimes make up for its
limited features. Figure 3 shows Dillo in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f3.large.jpg"><img src="10160f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Dillo is a seriously
snappy graphical browser.
</p></div></div><p>
The current 0.8 branch of Dillo is no longer maintained, but it's
still a mainstay in most major distributions' repositories. It's
easy to find and install. A new version based on FLTK2 is where
development is going at this stage. Those of you feeling a little brave
and willing to do a little source code compiling are invited to download
the development code from the site at <a href="http://www.dillo.org" target="_self">www.dillo.org</a>.
The classic
source is also available.
</p><p>
Finding a balance between the needs of offering a feature-rich browser
while maintaining speed at a maximum and resources at a minimum is the
driving force behind the final two items on tonight's menu.
</p><p>
Our next selection for tonight is Christian Dywan's Midori,
a great little Web browser whose rendering engine uses WebKit instead of
Gecko. For those who may not know, WebKit is an open-source rendering
engine based on KHTML, the HTML rendering engine created by the fine
people of the KDE Project. Midori (Figure 4) also features tabbed
browsing, custom context menus, configurable interface, JavaScript
plugins and, of course, peppy rendering, courtesy of WebKit.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f4.large.jpg"><img src="10160f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Cool name aside, Midori is the
only browser I've found that can pass the Acid3 test.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1668580.0x1761538"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Think you may have heard of WebKit somewhere
else? That's because WebKit is the engine behind Mac OS X's Safari
browser.
</p></div><p>
Changes to Midori's interface and behavior are largely controlled via
the Preferences dialog (Figure 5). Click Edit on the menu bar, and
select Preferences. From there, you can set a default home page, change
the look and feel (including default fonts), and more. You'll also find
evidence of Midori's young age when you run into pages that don't yet
allow edits.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f5.large.jpg"><img src="10160f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Preferences menu gives
you access to much of Midori's configuration.
</p></div></div><p>
Midori is, as I mentioned, a young browser. It's also a
fascinating and promising project, and it's fast. Really fast. And,
it's the only browser on my system to pass the Acid3 test
(<a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org" target="_self">acid3.acidtests.org</a>).
</p><p>
The final item on our menu is Hidetaka Iwai's Kazehakase, a
graphical browser that uses the Mozilla Gecko rendering engine to display
Web pages. As such, it doesn't lack for much when it comes to showing
off Web sites as you expect to see them. Kazehakase, which means
&ldquo;Wind
Doctor&rdquo; is named after a short story by the Japanese author
Sakaguchi
Ango. This is a great little program that features tabbed browsing,
customizable mouse gestures and keyboard shortcuts, RSS bookmarks
and more (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f6.large.jpg"><img src="10160f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Kazehakase is an excellent
browser based on the Mozilla Gecko engine.
</p></div></div><p>
Possibly the coolest thing about Kazehakase is its graded user
interface. It's a great concept. By default, the user interface is kept
as simple as possible, providing users with only the basics both in
terms of menu options and configuration of system preferences. The user
interface level (UI levels) can be set to beginner, medium or expert. At
each level, you find additional hidden gems under the surface that let
you fine-tune the browser. There are two ways to change the UI level. The
first is by changing the preferences. To get to the system preferences,
click Edit on the menu bar, then select Preference. The beginner UI
preferences window appears with the main options to the right and
a sidebar menu on the left (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f7.large.jpg"><img src="10160f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. On the left, you can see Kazehakase's basic (or beginner)
preferences. To the right is the same dialog but in expert mode.
</p></div></div><p>
There are only four categories of simple changes here. If you change
the UI level to expert, a much more complex and complete preferences
menu appears, as shown on the right-hand side of Figure 7. If you choose,
you also can toggle the UI level directly from the menu bar by clicking
View and selecting your level of expertise from the UI level submenu
(Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10160f8.large.jpg"><img src="10160f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Becoming an expert
in Kazahakase is just one little menu option away.
</p></div></div><p>
Kazehakase isn't widely available in distribution repositories, so you may
have to resort to the old extract-and-build five-step for that one. This
is a great little browser and well worth checking out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1668580.0x1b5a3e8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Marcel's extract-and-build five-step is available from his Web site at
<a href="http://www.marcelgagne.com/fivestep.html" target="_self">www.marcelgagne.com/fivestep.html</a>.
</p></div><p>
There you have it, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, the underdogs of the
browser
world&mdash;some of them anyhow, as I am sure there are plenty more. Can
any of them compete against the big guys? That depends on your needs
and constraints. If fast as lightning trumps a bulked-up feature
set, the underdogs win. The same is true on a small, underpowered
machine. Researchers who are more interested in text may opt out of
the graphical browsers entirely. Each underdog, you might say, can have
its day.
</p><p>
Speaking of day, this one is nearly done, and the only browsing I intend
to do after closing is in the wine cellar. Speaking of which, keep your
glasses handy as Fran&ccedil;ois will happily refill them a final time. Raise your
glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us
all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
