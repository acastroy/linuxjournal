Databases make the world go round, but sometimes fitting a round data peg into a
square database hole is less than ideal. What's a programmer to do?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x2370358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Relational databases are really great for storing and retrieving data,
but sometimes, they aren't quite up to the task. Joe Celko, whose
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SQL for Smarties</em></span> books are among my favorites, dedicated an entire
volume to the issue of trees and hierarchies. These data structures
might be common and useful in most programming languages, but they can be
difficult to model as tables, particularly if you care about efficient
use of the database. Things become even trickier if you're dealing
with a number of related, but distinct, types of entities, such as
different types of employees or different types of vehicles.
</p><p>
One way to solve this problem is not to use relational databases.
Objects can be quite good at handling trees and arrays, as well as
inheritance hierarchies. Furthermore, object databases do exist, and
the Python-based Zope application framework has demonstrated that it's
even possible to have object databases in production. Gemstone's
demonstration of Ruby running on top of its Smalltalk VM, with its
accompanying object database, means that Ruby programmers soon
might have access to similar technology.
</p><p>
But, object databases still are far from the mainstream. Most Web
developers have access to a relational database, and not much else.
Is there anything that we can do for these people?
</p><p>
This month, we take a look at two different ways we can
handle data that doesn't quite fit into a relational database. These
techniques are quite different from one another, and they don't even come
close to the full range of possibilities you can get with a
relational database. But, they both work and are used in production
environments&mdash;and if your data doesn't seem to fit into
standard database paradigms, you might want to consider one of them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x23706c8"></a>
PostgreSQL's Table Inheritance</h2></div></div><p>
Some data-modeling issues are typically even harder to deal with. For
example, a classic introduction to the world of object-oriented
programming describes a human resources department. The HR department
tracks employees, all of whom have some common characteristics. But,
some employees are programmers, some are secretaries, and some are
managers&mdash;and each of the employee types has specific data that needs to
be associated with them.
</p><p>
In an object-oriented world, it's easy to model this. You create an
employee class, and then create multiple subclasses of programmer,
secretary and manager. Subclassing creates an &ldquo;is-a&rdquo;
relationship, such that a programmer is an employee. This means
that programmers have all the attributes of an employee, but also
have some additional characteristics that distinguish them from an
ordinary employee. With these subclasses in place, we then can create
an array (or any other data structure) of people in our company,
knowing that although some are programmers and others are secretaries,
they're all employees and can be treated as such.
</p><p>
Translating this idea to the world of relational databases can be a
bit tricky. One solution is to use inheritance in your database
tables. PostgreSQL has done this for years; thus, it's called an
object-relational database by many users. You can do the following
in PostgreSQL, for example:


<pre     class="programlisting">

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    id            SERIAL,
    first_name    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    last_name     TEXT    NOT NULL,
    email_address TEXT    NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    UNIQUE(email_address)
);

CREATE TABLE Programmers (
    main_language    TEXT    NOT NULL
) INHERITS(Employees);

CREATE TABLE Secretaries (
    words_per_minute    INTEGER    NOT NULL
) INHERITS(Employees);


INSERT INTO Employees (first_name, last_name, email_address)
    VALUES ('George', 'Washington', 'georgie@whitehouse.gov');

INSERT INTO Programmers (first_name, last_name,
                         email_address, main_language)
    VALUES ('Linus', 'Torvalds', 'torvalds@osdl.org', 'C');

INSERT INTO Secretaries (first_name, last_name,
                         email_address, words_per_minute)
    VALUES ('Condoleezza', 'Rice', 'rice@state.gov', 10);

</pre>
</p><p>
If we ask for all employees in the system, we'll get all three of the
people we have entered:


<pre     class="programlisting">

atf=# select * from employees;
 id | first_name | last_name  |     email_address
----+------------+------------+------------------------
  1 | George     | Washington | georgie@whitehouse.gov
  2 | Linus      | Torvalds   | torvalds@osdl.org
  3 | Condoleezza| Rice       | rice@state.gov
(3 rows)

</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, this query shows only the columns of the Employees
table, which are common to that table and to those that inherit from
it. If we want to find out how many words per minute someone types,
we must address that query specifically to the Secretaries
table:


<pre     class="programlisting">

atf=# select * from secretaries;
 id | first_name | last_name | email_address  | words_per_minute
----+------------+-----------+----------------+------------------
  3 | Condoleezza| Rice      | rice@state.gov |               10
(1 row)

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the id column for all three tables, which was defined as
SERIAL (that is, a nonrepeating incrementing integer), is unique across
all three tables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x2370bf0"></a>
Polymorphic Associations</h2></div></div><p>
The way that PostgreSQL has integrated this type of object
hierarchy into its relational system is impressive, flexible and
useful. And yet, because it is unique to PostgreSQL, it means that no
higher-level, database-agnostic application framework can support it.
This especially is true in Ruby on Rails, which tries to treat all
databases as similar or identical, going so far as to encourage
programmers to use a Ruby-based domain-specific language
(migrations) to create and modify database definitions. Using
PostgreSQL's inheritance features might work, but it will take a fair
amount of twisting to make it compatible with Rails.
</p><p>
Besides, Rails already has a feature, known as polymorphic
associations, that lets us work with distinct types of items as if
they were part of a single class. This isn't the same as an object
hierarchy&mdash;we can't say that secretaries and programmers are both
types of employees. But, we can say that secretaries and programmers
are both employable and treat them as similar via that description.
</p><p>
To begin, you might remember that Rails has something known as
associations, which allow us to connect one model to another. For
example, let's say that each company has one or more employees. Thus, we
can create some simple models. We can generate migrations with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate model company name:string
./script/generate model employee first_name:string
    last_name:string email_address:string company_id:integer
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, we can turn the automatically generated migration files into
actual database tables with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we can indicate that each company can have one or more employees
by modifying the model files. For example, we add the following to
employee.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :employees
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Similarly, we can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Employee &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
end

</pre>
</p><p>
With has_many and belongs_to in place, we now have created an
&ldquo;association&rdquo; between these two models. This might not seem too
exciting, but it means we can treat the two tables as object
classes and each row in the table as an instance:

<pre     class="programlisting">

xyz = Company.create(:name =&gt; 'XYZ Corporation')

george = Employee.create(:first_name =&gt; 'George',
    :last_name =&gt; 'Washington',
    :email_address =&gt; 'georgie@whitehouse.gov',
    :company_id =&gt; xyz.id)

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p xyz.employees.first
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x2371220"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and we get back our george user. Similarly, we can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p george.company
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x2371380"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and get back our xyz company. This is all standard stuff for Rails
programmers, and it is part of the ActiveRecord feature known as
associations. You can create all sorts of associations, giving them
arbitrary names. For example, we could say:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :employees
  has_many :employees_with_a, :class_name =&gt; 'Employee',
            :conditions =&gt; "first_name ilike '%a%'"
end

</pre>
</p><p>
With this in place, and after restarting the console (or typing
<tt  >reload!</tt>), we now can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xyz = Company.find_by_name('XYZ Corporation')

xyz.employees_with_a
</pre>
</p><p>
This prints the empty list&mdash;not surprising, given that we have
defined only a single employee so far, and his name didn't contain an
a. But, now we can create a second employee:


<pre     class="programlisting">

jane = Employee.create(:first_name =&gt; 'Jane',
                       :last_name =&gt; 'Austin',
                       :email_address =&gt; 'jane@bookauthor.com',
                       :company_id =&gt; xyz.id)

</pre>
</p><p>
If we run our association again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xyz.employees_with_a
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x23717a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
now we get our jane employee.
</p><p>
This is all well and good, but what happens if we want to represent
different types of employees, each of whom is employed by a company,
but with different associated data? This is where polymorphic
associations become useful. In order for this to work, we need to
change the definitions of our models, as well as the relationships
among them (if you're playing along at home, blow away the
existing Employee and Company models before continuing):


<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate model company name:string
./script/generate model contract employable_id:integer
 employable_type:string company_id:integer
./script/generate model programmer main_language:string
 first_name:string last_name:string email_address:string
./script/generate model secretary words_per_minute:integer
 first_name:string last_name:string email_address:string
</pre>
</p><p>
The above invocations of script/generate create four different models:
one for a company, another for a programmer, another for a secretary
and a fourth for a contract. Our PostgreSQL model allowed us to
have a single Employee table and to have programmers and
secretaries inherit from that table. Rails doesn't let us specify
that one model inherits from another. Rather, we use Rails to
describe the relationships among the models. Companies are connected
to programmers and secretaries via employment contracts.
</p><p>
Because we are looking at the relationships among standalone models,
rather than an inheritance hierarchy, there's no obviously good place
in which to stick attributes that are common to programmers and
secretaries. In the end, I decided to put the attributes in the
programmer and secretary models, respectively, despite the repetition.
</p><p>
Now, let's define the associations:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :contracts
end

class Contract &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :employable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
end

class Programmer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :contracts, :as =&gt; :employable
  has_many :companies, :through =&gt; :contracts
end

class Secretary &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :contracts, :as =&gt; :employable
  has_many :companies, :through =&gt; :contracts
end

</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, each company has many contracts. Each contract joins
together a company and someone who is employable. Who is employable?
Right now, only programmers and secretaries fit the bill, connecting
to the employable interface with contracts, and then to a company
via a contract.
</p><p>
Behind the scenes, Rails is pulling a nasty trick, one that should
make any good database programmer feel sick. The contract model
includes two fields (employable_id and employable_type), which point
to a single row in a particular table. In some ways, this is sort of
a poor man's foreign key. But the difference is that the foreign key
can point to any of several tables. And, of course, there is no error
checking; only the application can stop me from entering a random text
string in the employable_type column.
</p><p>
So, now we can create some relationships:


<pre     class="programlisting">

xyz = Company.create(:name =&gt; 'XYZ Corporation')

p1 = Programmer.create(:first_name =&gt; 'Linus',
                       :last_name =&gt; 'Torvalds',
                       :email_address =&gt; 'torvalds@osdl.org',
                       :main_language =&gt; 'C')

Contract.create(:employable =&gt; p1, :company =&gt; xyz)

s1 = Secretary.create(:first_name =&gt; 'Condoleezza',
                      :last_name =&gt; 'Rice',
                      :email_address =&gt; 'rice@state.gov',
                      :words_per_minute =&gt; 90)

Contract.create(:employable =&gt; s1, :company =&gt; xyz)

</pre>
</p><p>
That's already pretty remarkable. Because both programmers and
secretaries are employable (as they both expose the employable
interface to the contracts model, using <tt  >has_many :as</tt>), we can join
each of them to an instance of the contract model.
</p><p>
But, it gets better, if we add a few more associations:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class Contract &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :company
  belongs_to :employable, :polymorphic =&gt; true

  belongs_to :programmer,
    :class_name =&gt; 'Programmer', :foreign_key =&gt; 'employable_id'
  belongs_to :secretary,
    :class_name =&gt; 'Secretary', :foreign_key =&gt; 'employable_id'
end

class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :contracts

  has_many :programmers, :through =&gt; :contracts,
           :source =&gt; :programmer,
           :conditions =&gt; "contracts.employable_type = 'Programmer' "

  has_many :secretaries, :through =&gt; :contracts,
           :source =&gt; :secretary,
           :conditions =&gt; "contracts.employable_type = 'Secretary' "

end

</pre>
</p><p>
With this in place, we now have a complete bidirectional association
between programmers and secretaries on one side and companies on the
other. Thus, we can say:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt; xyz.programmers
=&gt; [#&lt;Programmer id: 1, main_language: "C", first_name: "Linus",
last_name: "Torvalds", email_address: "torvalds@osdl.org", created_at:
"2008-06-12 00:47:58", updated_at: "2008-06-12 00:47:58"&gt;]

&gt;&gt; xyz.secretaries
=&gt; [#&lt;Secretary id: 1, words_per_minute: 90, first_name:
"Condoleezza", last_name: "Rice", email_address: "rice@state.gov",
created_at: "2008-06-12 00:54:34", updated_at: "2008-06-12
00:54:34"&gt;]

</pre>
</p><p>
But, we also can say:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt;&gt; Programmer.find(1).companies
=&gt; [#&lt;Company id: 1, name: "XYZ Corporation", created_at: "2008-06-12
    00:47:18", updated_at: "2008-06-12 00:47:18"&gt;]

</pre>
</p><p>
Moreover, we can iterate over xyz.contracts, bringing together the
secretaries and programmers models into one package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt; xyz.contracts.each {|c| puts c.employable.first_name}
Linus
Condoleezza
</pre>
</p><p>
Although Rails does not provide inheritance within the models,
polymorphic associations make it possible to come close to such
functionality. You also get a bunch of convenience
functions that make it more natural to work with these additional
attributes.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Not all data fits cleanly into two-dimensional tables. When this
occurs, you can try to shoehorn your data into an inappropriate
container. Or, you can try to use the help that is built in to one or
more levels of your software stack. If you use PostgreSQL, 
inheritance can be really useful. If you use Rails, you can take
advantage of polymorphic associations, allowing you to treat two or
more models with a common API as similar. This isn't the sort of
thing you'll do each day, but it's a useful skill to have on
hand for cases when you need to take unusual data.
