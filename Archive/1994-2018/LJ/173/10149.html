PlayStation Portable Video Converter 
(PSPVC, <a href="http://pspvc.sourceforge.net" target="_self">pspvc.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
First off is a handy tool for all you fellow PSP owners
out there. PSPVC allows you to convert a video file into the PSP's
native format and take care of its mandatory file-naming
scheme. According to PSPVC's Web site:
&ldquo;PSPVC is an FFmpeg front end for converting video files for the PSP. It
allows you to queue several conversions with different parameters for
each. It supports MPEG-4/SP (all firmware) and H264/AVC (firmware 2.0+).&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10149f1.large.jpg"><img src="10149f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
PSPVC&mdash;PSP owners now can convert their videos with ease with this nice little application.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
PSPVC is available with certain distro repositories, but I'm running
the bleeding-edge source version. In terms of requirements,
PSPVC isn't too picky and uses fairly common libraries for most
multimedia systems, including nasm, libfaac, liba52, libxvidcore
and GTK+ 2.0. However, you also need the development packages for these
multimedia libraries&mdash;named in the style of liba52-dev,
libfaac-dev and so on&mdash;although this may not be the case if you are
using a source-based distribution instead of a binary one.
</p><p>
Grab the installation tarball from the project's Web site,
and extract it to a new directory. Enter the new pspvc-install directory,
open a terminal there, and enter the following command
(as root or with sudo):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ./install.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're lucky, the install script should configure and compile itself
in one long go. If it gets stuck partway through, it probably needs
a library, and it will let you know in an error message. Once the
script is finished, a menu entry usually appears under Multimedia&rarr;PSPVC - Video Converter, or you can
start it by entering <tt  >pspvc</tt>
at the command line.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once loaded, the first thing you need to do is choose a video file
to convert. The first field has a Browse button next to it, so
choose the file you want to convert from there, and click Open. The file 
is loaded into the main screen, and you are given a number of options
from which to choose before conversion. The first is called Profile, 
where you can select the video's aspect ratio (16/9 for widescreen or
4/3 for the older full-screen format), bitrate and codec. If you choose
MPEG-4/SP, it will work on any PSP. However, selecting H264/AVC gives
you better quality, but works only on PSPs that have had a firmware
upgrade since version 2.0.
</p><p>
If the video's volume is too loud or quiet, the Volume
field allows you to adjust it before encoding starts. The
PSP Filename field is the trickiest; it contains the MAQ number,
which makes you choose a filename number that hasn't already
been assigned in your PSP's video folder. This requires you to plug in
your PSP, look under the video folder (my PSP uses mp_root/100mnv01,
but yours may differ) and choose a number that doesn't appear on any
filenames, if you already have some files in there. If there's nothing there
to begin with, 10001 will do fine; otherwise, choose a new number.
</p><p>
Once all the options are out of the way, press Convert. A new window
appears showing the conversion process, and a thumbnail generator
lets you see a preview of the video you are converting. Once
the conversion is finished, your new video will be sitting in the same
folder as the video you chose to convert. Copy this new file to your
PSP's video folder along with its corresponding <span   class="emphasis"><em>videoname</em></span>.thm
file, and your new video is ready to play.
</p><p>
All in all, PSPVC is a simple and pain-free application that even has
an easy compilation process. If you're a PSP owner, I'd put PlayStation
Portable Video Converter in the must-have category. Hopefully, it
will appear in most distro archives soon.

PCManFM&mdash;Lightweight File Manager
(<a href="http://pcmanfm.sourceforge.net" target="_self">pcmanfm.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
PCManFM is a lightweight file manager that is both quick
to load and easy to use. It includes tabbed browsing and
device viewing, and it may well scratch an itch for those who like things
streamlined. Here's the feature list, according to the project's Web site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Extremely fast and lightweight.
</p></li><li><p>
Can be started in one second on normal machines.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
Drag-and-drop support.
</p></li><li><p>
Files can be dragged among tabs.
</p></li><li><p>
Loads large directories in a reasonable amount of time.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10149f2.large.jpg"><img src="10149f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
PCManFM&mdash;Fast and Light File Management, with Tabbed
Browsing
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ffd850"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Aside from the usual X11 libraries, here are the needed dependencies,
as stated on the project's Web site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
automake &gt;= 1.9.
</p></li><li><p>
libgtk2.0-dev &gt;= 2.6.
</p></li><li><p>
libglib2.0-dev &gt;= 2.6 (2.10+ is highly recommended).
</p></li><li><p>
libgamin-dev or libfam-dev (libgamin is preferred).
</p></li><li><p>
libstartup-notification0-dev.
</p></li><li><p>
libhal-dev (required when the --enable-hal configure option is used).
</p></li><li><p>
libdbus-1-dev (required when the --enable-hal configure option is used).
</p></li><li><p>
libhal-storage-dev (required when --enable-hal configure option is used).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you have the dependencies out of the way, head to the Web site,
grab the latest tarball and extract it to a new folder. Open a terminal
in the new folder, and do the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x23f6230"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or with sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
It should work without any issues, and if it doesn't, the configure script should
pick up any snags.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once the installation finishes, PCManFM can be started either by
entering <tt  >pcmanfm</tt> at the command line or by going to
Utilities&rarr;PCMan File Manager. Once inside the main screen, you'll
notice two panes. The left contains links to your home folder, the
desktop and your storage devices. The right contains all of your
files and folders. For tabbed browsing, you can go to File&rarr;New Tab, or press Ctrl-T. You can
open a new window by selecting 
File&rarr;New Window or pressing Ctrl-N.
</p><p>
For further usage exploits, I recommend tweaking the settings under
Edit&rarr;Preferences. Here you can change things such as colors and
icon and font sizes, but most important, you can define which
terminal you want to load via a shortcut, such as xterm, eterm
and so on. Once this is set, when you are browsing around any folders,
pressing F4 or choosing Tool&rarr;Open Terminal opens a new terminal
that already is pathed to the folder in which you're sitting.
</p><p>
Ultimately, PCManFM is the best lightweight file manager I've used so far.
It has a feel reminiscent of a streamlined Konqueror, and I 
recommend it to anyone who needs a file manager that is light on
resources. For any lightweight distro builders, I also recommend trying
this as your default file manager&mdash;the interface is very intuitive
and familiar. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x23f6650"></a>
Xfburn&mdash;XFCE CD Burner	
(<a href="http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfburn" target="_self">www.xfce.org/projects/xfburn</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, we have a CD-burning application for fans of the
Xfce desktop, or even for those wanting a nice but light application for
slower machines. According to its Web site, &ldquo;Xfburn is a simple CD/DVD-burning tool based on libburnia libraries. It can blank CD-RWs, burn
and create ISO images, as well as burn personal compositions of data to
either CD or DVD. It is currently under heavy development.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10149f3.large.jpg"><img src="10149f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Xfburn&mdash;Very K3b-ish but without the Bulk
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Xfburn is available in some repositories, but as usual, it's typically an older
version (I'm compiling 0.3.0 at the moment; at the time of this writing, the
Ubuntu servers have version 0.2.0). Running with the source version,
there are a few picky requirements, but not too many. Like almost all
Linux apps designed for a certain desktop, they can be run in
any desktop you like, but you need to have some of the original
desktop's libraries installed. So yes, install Xfce while you're there.
</p><p>
As for other dependencies, the configure script whined about libburn and
libiosfs, which I installed from the Ubuntu archives, but that didn't work. The
Web site mentions libburnia, which I couldn't find in the archives at all,
so I actually grabbed the source for libisofs and compiled that, which
did work (the libburnia/libisofs home page is at <a href="http://libburnia-project.org" target="_self">libburnia-project.org</a>). The
last thing the configure script niggled about was something called exo,
which was fixed when I installed libexo and libexo-dev. After that was 
all sorted out, it was smooth sailing from there.
</p><p>
So, grab the latest tarball, extract it, open a terminal in the new folder
and do the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x23f6c28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, as root or with sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# make install
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
On what must be a record string of luck, Xfburn was the third app
in a row to install itself in the menu. Check under Utilities&rarr;Xfburn. If it's not there, enter
<tt  >xfburn</tt> at the command line. For me,
first impressions were of a slimmed-down K3b, and if you're finding this
strangely reminiscent of that last PCManFM section, you're right. This
is another one of those instant-loading programs that doesn't contain a
zillion warning messages upon startup, and it has functional aesthetics without
being ugly and GNOMEish (yes, I said it&mdash;send all hate mail to the address
at the end of this article).
</p><p>
However, usage still is fairly restricted for the moment. As you can see
from those three big buttons at the start, you currently are limited to
&ldquo;Burn Image, New Data Composition and Blank Disc&rdquo;. Any new projects
are opened in new tabs, K3b style, leaving the welcome screen at
the first tab, allowing you to continue with more burning tasks. The
Preferences section is clean and simple, and it lets you scan for
devices without any of the manual trickery you may expect from a lightweight
application. The nicest touch I found was the drop-down box toward the
bottom right of the screen when composing a new disc that lets you 
choose whatever size disc you are using on the fly&mdash;very refreshing.
</p><p>
For the moment, this application is quite limited in that it's data-only for now (no audio CDs or video DVDs), but it still is in heavy
development. The development team has made the wise choice of making the
program very modular and scalable, allowing them to add bits later
but keep the mechanics tight on what they have coded for now. Again,
for any lightweight distro builders, this is a neat choice, and
once development has added further functionality, Xfburn and PCManFM
would make a formidable combination for everyday desktop usage.
