An overview of current capabilities and achievements in Linux audio development.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fc2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The world of Linux audio covers many domains, from basic desktop sound
services to embedded systems, from simple Internet telephony to the
demands of professional recording studios. This article presents
an overview of the Linux audio world and its current status.
</p><p>
Due to the breadth of the topic, I have divided this article into two
parts. For the same reason, it is impossible to discuss any particular
program in-depth in this kind of survey. However, I cover many of
the programs mentioned here in my articles for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>),
and I refer readers to those articles for more detail on
individual programs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fc568"></a>
General Commentary</h2></div></div><p>
Sound support in Linux has progressed grandly since my first experience
with the system in the mid-1990s. The mainstream distributions all
have excellent device detection, including sound card detection,
and the typical desktop audio functions are configured transparently
during installation. Most distributions let users 
add and configure extra sound devices manually, but some detect and
configure multiple devices automatically. Any configuration needed
after installation is handled similarly through control panels and other
user-friendly utilities. In addition to technical advances, Linux sound
and music applications have grown in number and sophistication. We now
have excellent software for media production and playback, and there is
good reason to expect continued development in audio-oriented
domains.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fc670"></a>
Software Categories</h2></div></div><p>
In this overview, I distinguish between the two broad categories of
system software and applications software. System software here includes
the kernel sound system and other tools and utilities that make the
user-level programs work. This software is usually not associated with
normal usage, and typical users may, in fact, never even know about
it. Nevertheless, this layer is where the heavy lifting is done, and
although it's not flashy or sexy, it is the heart of the Linux audio
system. In contrast, applications software includes the programs that
present themselves to users via the distribution's menus, toolbars
and file managers. This software is what typical users understand
and employ on a regular basis.
</p><p>
The first part of this article covers system software and a variety of
other audio-related software domains. The second part focuses on the
state of Linux sound and music production software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fc7d0"></a>
System Software</h2></div></div><p>
ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) provides the core audio and
MIDI services to the Linux kernel. These services include the device
drivers installed with the kernel, a library and API for programmers,
various user-level tools and utilities, and firmware for some USB and
other devices. If a project's development is reflected in its changelogs,
ALSA is clearly a very active project, with a steady stream of
enhancements and fixes, and an expanding list of supported sound cards
and audio chipsets.
</p><p>
The developers at 4Front Technologies have improved their OSS (Open Sound
System) Linux package in similar fashion. In 2007, the company announced
the decision to place the system under open-source licensing. As a result,
OSS is now a free, open-source project, complete with source repository,
Bugzilla, wiki and protection by the GPL, BSD and CDDL licenses. But,
all this goodness isn't only for Linux. The OSS package also provides
high-quality audio/MIDI services to our comrades on UNIX systems, such
as FreeBSD and Solaris.
</p><p>
ALSA and OSS provide the device drivers needed to make your sound hardware
usable by the operating system. Sometimes they create these drivers
by consulting material provided by manufacturers, and sometimes they
reverse-engineer a driver. To my knowledge, only Audio Science 
offers Linux drivers developed in-house. Audio Science manufactures
high-quality audio hardware marketed mainly to radio broadcasters,
and codes and provides native Linux drivers for its products. Ah,
if only [manufacturer's name deleted] would be so wise.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fc988"></a>
Desktop Sound Servers</h2></div></div><p>
Normal desktop actions and activities that require audio services
include system sounds, media players, Internet telephones and
simple recording. However, normal users now expect amenities, such as
transparent software mixing and relatively glitch-free performance, in
a multitasking system. ALSA's dmix plugin provides software mixing, but
not all distributions want to employ it. Thus, competition remains 
for the position of the default Linux desktop audio server. GNOME
still uses esd (the Enlightened Sound D&aelig;mon), and KDE still backs the
aRts d&aelig;mon, but the PulseAudio Project definitely is the newcomer
to watch. PulseAudio already has been adopted as the sound server of
choice for the OLPC XO laptop and for recent releases of Ubuntu, and
there's reason to believe it may overtake esd and/or artsd as the One
True Server for typical users' sound-related activities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fcae8"></a>
For the Professional: JACK</h2></div></div><p>
The demands of professional audio production require a different order
of performance from a sound server. None of the servers mentioned
above are capable of drop-out free performance under heavy resource
demand&mdash;for example, multichannel recording with high sample rates and
bit depths&mdash;and they cannot be considered suitable under pro-audio
conditions. Fortunately, Linux has JACK, a truly professional-grade
audio server and master transport system. If you plan on producing
professional-quality audio with Linux sound and music software, you 
need to know JACK.
</p><p>
JACK development is steady and continues to expand the system's
capabilities. JackMIDI is showing up in more applications, and the
jackdmp Project points the way toward JACK's future on multiprocessor
architectures. Current versions already run on OS X, and there's even
been a successful port to Windows. Currently supported back ends now
include ALSA, OSS, PulseAudio, FreeBob/FFADO (for FireWire devices)
and CoreAudio (on OS X).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fcc48"></a>
Other Notable System Software</h2></div></div><p>
Erik de Castro Lopo has contributed some essential components to the
Linux audio infrastructure. His libsndfile provides programmers with
a comprehensive library for handling file I/O for a great variety of
soundfile formats, and his libsamplerate has found broad acceptance as the
preferred tool for high-quality sample rate conversion. These libraries
relieve applications programmers from the burden of writing code for
very common tasks, and both packages are common dependencies throughout
the world of Linux audio software. I'm also happy to report that both
libraries are currently maintained.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fcd50"></a>
Common Applications</h2></div></div><p>
The sound-related software most familiar to typical users includes media
players, games and audio communication devices. In each instance, the
application itself does not handle audio directly, instead relying on
the kernel's sound API (that is, ALSA). This reliance frees application
developers to focus on features, rather than on how to interface with users'
sound hardware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fce58"></a>
Media Players</h2></div></div><p>
Linux music players are a mixed blessing. For average users, programs
such as Amarok, Banshee, Rhythmbox and the XMMS clan work well for
playing most audio formats (MP3, Ogg, WAV, AIFF and so on). AlsaPlayer
continues to provide a lighter-weight player, not so feature-rich but
stable and JACK-savvy. JACK-awareness is one of my personal complaints
with most of the current music players, but I have reason to hope that
the major players will get it and at least provide a plugin for JACK
connectivity. And, while I'm dreaming, I'd also like to see Linux media
players adopt the JACK master control system. More typical wish lists
include true gapless playback and support for huge collections. The
development teams of the popular players are quite aware of these requests
and are working to address them in future releases. As Figure 1 indicates,
some developers are indeed moving forward.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10162f1.large.jpg"><img src="10162f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Amarok does JACK with libxine.
</p></div></div><p>
Multimedia players, such as MPlayer and Xine, continue their development
march forward. These projects are well established, and many users rely
on them heavily for more than just DVD and video file playback. MPlayer
(and its sister software MEncoder) is a veritable toolkit for a wide
variety of video and audio tasks, and the Xine library is used by many
other applications that need video capabilities. Both programs play
a wide variety of video and audio formats, and both include hooks for
user-friendly GUIs.
</p><p>
Alas, there is a snake in the grass in this field. Video players depend
on codecs that provide support for the seemingly endless variety of video
formats, and many popular formats are patent-encumbered. One immediate
result of this situation is the difficulty or impossibility of including
these codecs in a mainstream Linux distribution. Some distros simply point
users to a repository where they can download the necessary packages,
but it would, of course, be better if the codecs could be installed along
with the players. However, until patent law reform takes place (in the
US, at least), there can be no other way to supply the software.
</p><p>
Playback of encrypted DVDs also is problematic. It appears that
the MPAA is no longer pursuing legal action against distribution
of the DCSS software, but distribution vendors remain hesitant to
include the software directly. Again, users typically are directed to a
distribution point on the Internet where they can acquire the software
they need to watch their legally purchased discs. Although these extra
steps may seem trivial to seasoned users, they often are confusing and
seem unnecessary to novices, especially when there is little or
no understanding of the legal ramifications. Nevertheless, until patent
encumbrance and copyright entanglements are things of the past, the extra
steps will be necessary if users expect fully functional media playback.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fd278"></a>
Game Sound</h2></div></div><p>
Beyond <span   class="emphasis"><em>PySol</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>XScrabble</em></span>, I'm not much of a gamer. However, I do
follow the updates on the Linux Game Tome and the Linux Games sites,
and the scene for Linux gaming and game development clearly is alive
and active. Game-centric programming toolkits flourish; new games appear
frequently (with the attendant and predictable variability in quality),
and even the occasional port from Windows shows up. The common critique
I hear from avid gamers is that Linux is a great platform for running
games, but too few great games exist in native Linux versions. Indeed,
Windows users can claim a massive number of high-quality games available
only for that platform, but from this dabbler's perspective, the Linux
gaming world is healthy and developing nicely.
</p><p>
Most of the currently maintained game development toolkits (ClanLib,
Crystal Space and SDL) support ALSA and OSS, but the Allegro library also
supports JACK, which I think is very cool. The
OpenAL Project still is under development, but slowly. Creative Labs
and Apple have invested in the system's development, mainly for Vista
and OS X, but it appears that 3-D and surround sound (5.1, 7.1) are fully
supported in the Linux releases as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fd4e0"></a>
Embedded Devices</h2></div></div><p>
Linux-powered portable hardware is common these days, so we can expect
to encounter the Linux sound system at work in those devices too. Alas,
I own no such devices and cannot directly comment on implementation
and performance of the sound system in that hardware. However,
LinuxDevices.com publishes a handy on-line list of Linux-powered
audio/video devices, most of which are media players, set-top boxes,
integrated media phones and so forth. Two notable exceptions to the
category include Ron Stewart's amazing Trinity, a portable Linux-powered
DAW (Figure 2), and the Plugzilla, a rackmounted standalone audio plugins
player. I don't own either of those units, but both should be tested and
evaluated as soon as possible. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10162f2.large.jpg"><img src="10162f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Emulators and Proprietary Software</h2></div></div><p>
The Wine Project has reached its 1.0 release stage. Among its many
virtues, we find support for a variety of audio/MIDI back ends, including
ALSA, JACK and OSS. Some sound and music programs for Windows 
run flawlessly with Wine, including Cockos Software's excellent Reaper
audio/MIDI sequencer, thanks to work on the wineasio driver. This driver
communicates with Wine's JACK support to yield surprising low-latency
performance when running ASIO-compliant Windows applications under Wine,
including VST/VSTi plugins. However, even with wineasio, it still
is unlikely that the major music and sound packages for Windows (Cubase,
Logic, Finale and so on) will run flawlessly under Wine. Those programs tend
to be large packages with a complicated relationship to the operating
system, typically more complicated than can be emulated with Wine.
</p><p>
Ardi's Executor, a Mac OS emulator, is gone, but at least two good
Atari emulators remain. If you want to run all that late 1980s MIDI music
software written for the Motorola 68K CPUs, XSteem and Hatari will do
the job. Alas, the Steem Project appears to on hold, but Hatari is in
current development.
</p><p>
The DOSemu Project continues on its steady development track. Recent
releases include significant improvements to the emulator's sound and
music capabilities, better integrating its functions with the kernel's
ALSA system. The DOSBox Project supports sound through the SDL audio
library, with special emphasis on game sound compatibility. MIDI output
is supported, but current versions lack MIDI input capability.
</p><p>
Emulators may become relics if virtualization delivers equal or better
performance. I have not yet tested music and sound applications in
environments such as VMware or VirtualBox, but the specifications for
those systems typically include ALSA and OSS support via virtualized
hardware. Unfortunately, the virtual sound devices are compatible typically
with the SoundBlaster16 or Intel's ubiquitous AC97 audio codec. These
devices are sufficient for low-demand programs, but they are not suitable
for use with high-end music and sound software for Windows.
</p><p>
A few intrepid commercial sound and music software houses have offered
Linux ports of their packages. The Renoise tracker (Figure 3) is available
in an excellent version for native Linux. Jorgen Aase's energyXT2 DAW
(digital audio workstation) has a sizable base of Linux users, and
Garritan recently announced that Aria, its next-generation sampler
engine, will be available in a native Linux version. Other vendors, such as
NCH Software (WavePad) and Cockos (Reaper), advertise that their programs
work with Wine and extend official support to that environment.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10162f3.large.jpg"><img src="10162f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Renoise in Its Native Linux Version
</p></div></div><p>
The number of these packages hardly constitutes a flood of releases
from major Windows developers, but such small streams can grow. More
users are becoming interested in Linux, and some percentage of those
users will be focused on its audio capabilities and its applications
for sound and music production. An opportunity exists for commercial
developers to expand into the Linux world, and their way has been made
clear by the solidity of the Linux audio infrastructure. I applaud the
houses that already have crossed into the Linux world, but it
remains to be seen whether these motivations and attractions are strong
enough to compel other commercial houses to develop native Linux packages
of their software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19fdc70"></a>
Development Tools and Environments</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux audio infrastructure provides well-designed and well-tested
programming interfaces for sound and music applications developers,
particularly if they employ JACK to handle audio (and now MIDI)
I/O. Alternatives include the OSS API and directly programming ALSA,
but JACK is truly the superior solution.
</p><p>
Regarding GUI toolkits: Qt and GTK remain the dominant players, but FLTK
and wxWidgets also are popular. This multiplicity of GUI toolkits has been
a problem for plugin developers, although the emerging LV2 specification
may resolve that issue.
</p><p>
Python and its GUI bindings have become popular for some types of music
applications, Tcl/Tk remains a popular scripting language for smaller
applications and rapid prototyping, and Java programmers have added
a sizable number of excellent applications to the Linux audio software
armory. Java audio programmers also can employ JJack, a JACK audio driver
for the JavaSound API. At this time, only the Frinika sequencer makes
use of JJack, but I hope to see it receive the attention it deserves.
</p><p>
The JUCE multiplatform development environment provides excellent
tools for developing audio applications. The JUCE framework is fully
JACK-compliant, but unfortunately, its adoption has been slow so far. Current
implementations include Rick Taube's GraceCL (next-generation algorithmic
music environment), Kjetil Mattheussen's Mammut (massive FFT audio
transformer) and Lucio Asnaghi's JOST plugin system. These programs
all have attractive GUIs with excellent audio capabilities&mdash;all courtesy
the JUCE framework.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19f4710"></a>
Media-Optimized Linux Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
Audio/video-optimized Linux distributions are
flourishing. Stand-out
systems include Planet CCRMA, 64 Studio, JAD, MusiX, Dynebolic and
Ubuntu Studio. Some of these distros include ISO images for making live
CDs that can be used to test the system without installing it to your
hard disk. All of them have been engineered for low-latency performance,
and all are currently maintained. These distributions are the Linux audio
novice's best friends; they are highly recommended for anyone who wants
to work seriously with audio/MIDI on Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19f4870"></a>
Community</h2></div></div><p>
Ivica Ico Bukvic is the current director of Linuxaudio.org, which is
&ldquo;...a not-for-profit consortium of libre software projects and artists,
companies, institutions, organizations and hardware vendors using Linux
kernel-based systems and allied libre software for audio-related work,
with an emphasis on professional tools for the music, production,
recording and broadcast industries.&rdquo; Among its many purposes, the
organization functions as a portal to a variety of &ldquo;priority&rdquo; links,
including URLs for an applications index, a software mirror, a VST
plugins compatibility database and other useful resources.
</p><p>
Linux audio developers meet annually at the Linux Audio Conference,
held in Koln in 2008. Rumor says that LAC2009 may be held in
Parma, Italy, but no definite plans have been made at the time of this
writing. This conference
is the event of the season for Linux sound folk&mdash;a four-day fiesta
of presentations, performances and much sharing of ideas, code and
music. Keep an eye on the LAC link page at Linuxaudio.org for news of
next year's conference, and be there if you can.
</p><p>
Program-centric communities have evolved around the maintained
projects. Communications channels include the typical forums, wikis,
mailing lists and IRC channels, but they now include channels, such as
YouTube and MySpace. YouTube has become an especially useful channel
for demonstration and instructional videos. Some examples of Linux audio
software in action can be found there now, and I expect more to appear.
</p><p>
A wide variety of music made with Linux software can be heard at Hans
Fugal's LAM site. Other good sources for Linux-made music include the
Linux Audio Users mailing-list archives, the Internet Archive and, of
course,
the forums and other comm channels mentioned above.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1904580.0x19f4b30"></a>
Closing Remarks</h2></div></div><p>
In my opinion, the Linux audio infrastructure is now a solid structure, with
exceptional capabilities and provision for future development. JACK is by
itself a most remarkable achievement, and it has become the cornerstone
for all serious audio applications, particularly in the pro-audio domain.
</p><p>
Configuration has been all but completely automated during installation,
and post-installation configuration has become a no-brainer in most
distributions. Distribution developers deserve high praise for the work
done in this regard. Again, it's not sexy stuff, but it makes a great
difference to the newbies and even to the not-so-newbies.
</p><p>
Audio performance on the normal multitasking desktop has been a
problematic point, but the PulseAudio Project promises a satisfactory
resolution to that problem. Only time will tell if its adoption becomes
widespread.
</p><p>
Normal applications that require audio support are well served by
the current software map. Requested features are being implemented,
and usability has improved greatly since Ye Olden Times. With software
mixing and relatively xrun-free playback, the desktop audio system is
looking and sounding better all the time.
