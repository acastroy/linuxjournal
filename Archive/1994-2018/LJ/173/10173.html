SnapLogic for Amazon EC2</h2></div></div><p>
Under the paradigm &ldquo;Really Simple Integration&rdquo;, the firm SnapLogic
has released SnapLogic for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), a new
variant of its open-source data integration framework. SnapLogic for EC2
&ldquo;provides Amazon Web Services users with a convenient SnapLogic deployment
option that scales easily and eliminates the costs of acquiring and
maintaining expensive server hardware&rdquo;. SnapLogic for EC2 also makes it
easier than ever to &ldquo;easily integrate data in the cloud with data behind
the firewall&rdquo;. Offered in two editions, a GPL'd Community Edition
and a commercial Enterprise Edition, SnapLogic enables enterprises
quickly and easily to make data from databases, SaaS applications,
SOA Web services and other common data sources. The Really Simple
Integration paradigm allows knowledge workers to use familiar tools,
such as Web browsers, Google and Excel to discover, consume, transform
and publish enterprise data, creating a virtuous cycle of self-service
data access and distribution.

iStor Networks' 10GbE integraStor iS512-10G</h2></div></div><p>
The latest iSCSI solution from iStor is the iS512-10G, a 10Gb
model of the iS512 integraStor storage system, which iStor calls &ldquo;the
world's fastest scalable iSCSI storage array optimized for small
and medium businesses&rdquo;. This second-generation 10GbE iSCSI storage
array offers native 10Gbps architecture supporting full duplex wire
speed data rates in excess of 1,100MB/sec and is &ldquo;2.5 times faster
and significantly less expensive than 4G Fibre Channel&rdquo;, says iStor.
iStor also notes that mass adoption of 10GbE is close to or perhaps
at its tipping point, given the cost per Gbps of 10GbE ports dropping
below that for 1GbE ports, as well as the rate of server consolidation
driven by virtualization.

Talend's Open Profiler</h2></div></div><p>
Got &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; data? Skip the Pine-Sol and opt for Talend's Open Profiler.
Open Profiler is an open-source data profiler, which enables companies
to assess the quality of data and decide which actions must be taken to
correct the dirty data that irritates customers and costs companies time
and money. &ldquo;Data profiling is the first step to achieving reliable,
trustworthy data&rdquo;, says Talend. Such profiling reduces the time and
resources needed to find problematic data and allows companies to identify
potential problems before beginning data-intensive projects, such as data
integration or new application development. It also allows business
analysts to have more control over the maintenance and management of
the data.

Arkeia's EdgeFort 500 Series Backup Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
Arkeia is expanding its appliance business with the new EdgeFort
500 Series, an all-in-one, hardware and software backup system.
This set of appliances comes standard with 5TB virtual tape library
(expandable to 10TB), disk-to-disk-to-tape management software, Fibre
Channel connectivity and is fully integrated with Arkeia's network backup
software. Arkeia's federated data management architecture allows remote
and centralized data protection, making it possible for remote offices
and branch offices to back up, restore and archive critical data, with no
local IT resource needed. The EdgeFort 500 series is for the largest
data centers, while the earlier 100, 200 and 300 models were for small,
medium and large ones.

HP's Tru64 UNIX Advanced File System</h2></div></div><p>
Although HP's Tru64 UNIX Advanced File System (AdvFS) has been available
for more than 16 years, the big news is the recent contribution of its source
code to the Open Source community. HP states that &ldquo;the AdvFS source code
includes capabilities that increase uptime, enhance security and help
ensure maximum performance of Linux filesystems&rdquo;. HP will contribute
the code as a reference implementation of an enterprise Linux filesystem
under the terms of General Public License Version 2 for compatibility
with the Linux kernel. In addition, HP will provide design documentation,
test suites and engineering resources. HP further hopes that the source
code will serve as a technology base to advance ongoing development of
Linux by providing a comprehensive foundation for Linux kernel developers
to leverage and improve Linux filesystem functionality.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Adobe AIR in Action</em></span> (Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
The authorial team of Joey Lott, Kathryn Rotondo, Sam Ahn and Ashley
Atkins are riding the Adobe AIR wave with their new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Adobe AIR in
Action</em></span>, published by Manning. Adobe AIR, which also is available for the
Linux platform, is a cross-platform runtime environment that allows Web
developers to use their existing skills to start building applications
for the desktop. The example-driven book introduces AIR to developers
familiar with Flash and Flex, showing them how to build solid AIR-driven
desktop applications. Readers will learn the essential features of the
AIR API. The book shows how to create and customize native windows, as
well as how to read and write files and folders on the local filesystem.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Adobe AIR in Action</em></span> also shows how to set up and connect to a local
database, detect network connectivity and connect to Web services, bridge
ActionScript and JavaScript, and deploy and update their applications.

Chris Haseman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Android Essentials</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Will Google's Android mobile OS live up to its billing and shake up
the world of mobile devices? Judge for yourself with the help of
Chris Haseman's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Android Essentials</em></span> from Apress. Intended for
professional software engineers seeking to move their applications
into the mobile space, this book is a &ldquo;no-frills, no-nonsense,
code-centric run through the guts of application development&rdquo;
on Android. Rather than cover the entire Android catalog, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Android
Essentials</em></span> focuses on only four main topics: the application life
cycle and OS integration, user interface, location-based services
and networking. Among other things, readers will learn 
how an Android application functions and communicates with the handset
that hosts it, the complexities of timers, services and multimedia
playback and much more.

Protecode for Governance and IP Management</h2></div></div><p>
Protecode is a software-development solution for governance and IP
management that utilizes so-called protecoding, a unique methodology
to ensure software pedigree tracking. The company says that the latest
release &ldquo;enables commercial software developers and open-source creators
to accelerate managed adoption of open-source code in a simple, painless
process&rdquo;. Protecode automatically generates records of software content,
identifies and reports associated pedigree and licensing information by
checking its properties and compliance against an organization's policies,
establishing IP ownership and creating a software Bill of Materials (BOM).
The tool brings forward the detection of license policy violations to the
developer's desktop, where they can be addressed before becoming deeply
embedded into the product. A complimentary one-year subscription to
Protecode currently is available to anyone working actively on an 
Eclipse Project.
