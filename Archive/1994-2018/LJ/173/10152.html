How Linux models a DIY path out of the coming DTV catastrophe.

Like
many older geeks, I cut my technical teeth by hacking radio and
television gear. I built my first AM receivers with crystals and wires
wrapped around oatmeal boxes. In grade school, I built receivers and
transmitters from kits by Lafayette and Heath. I became a ham radio
operator at age 12, and I was obsessed with the innards of my Hammarlund
HQ-129x receiver and my Johnson Viking I transmitter.
</p><p>
In high school, I put a home-brew radio station on
the air, at 550kc (this was before we called cycles Hertz) on the AM
dial. We had only dials then. I possessed defective math skills, but I
was good with the concepts, especially as they applied in the
terrestrial sphere. I understood the inverse square law and the
geometries of wavelength applied to signals working in the real world.
</p><p>
In college, I followed a digressive
path into the humanities, but maintained an obsession with RF transmission
and propagation. In my twenties, I worked for a while in radio (where I got the Doc nickname), where among my duties was tweaking
transmitters and climbing towers to change bulbs. Among my many minor
distinctions was laying out the scenario by which many small-town FM
stations in central North Carolina would grow to become 100,000-watt
giants on towers up to 2,000-feet high, serving large portions of the
state and beyond.
</p><p>
Today, on this page, I am committing
a bold prophesy&mdash;one informed by more than 50 years
of obsessing about RF propagation: television as we know it
will end next February. It will end because nearly every station, by
long-standing FCC orders, will vacate the familiar channel on which it
has radiated for generations and go somewhere else on what used to be
TV's &ldquo;dial&rdquo;. More important, you're not going to get a signal at all
unless you're lucky enough to live within sight of the transmitting
antenna.
</p><p>
Well, you might say, most of us don't get TV from
antennas anymore. We get them from cable or satellite, which is true.
And, most stations will continue to call themselves Channel 2 or
Channel 13, even if their new digital signal is on Channel 50 or on
Channel 18. But there will still be problems. UHF doesn't propagate as
well as VHF. Digital signals don't degrade as gracefully. And, getting a
converter box to turn digital signals into analog ones for your old
television will be pointless if there's no signal there at all.
</p><p>
I
won't even bother going into the other ways that DTV transmission
will be a bust. The only thing that matters is that the conceptual
basis of TV as we've known it since WWII&mdash;signals transmitted through
the air, serving a physically limited region&mdash;will be nullified by
reality. And, that reality will include far more than technical failings
on the transmit side. The far bigger revolution will be on the
production side. Because production won't be limited to entertainment
giants pumping &ldquo;programs&rdquo; through a limited set of familiar
&ldquo;channels&rdquo;.
Instead, the power to produce will belong to everybody. The ends will
have the means. Horses will leave TV barns by the millions.
</p><p>
Which brings me to Linux, free software and open source.
We've
been modeling the DIY production of goods in the wild for the better
part of two decades (or longer if we date our start with the origins
of the Free Software movement). We've also been building our own
&ldquo;solutions&rdquo; since long before that term came into vogue as a synonym
for &ldquo;products&rdquo;. 
</p><p>
It's no coincidence that the transmitters on
which billions watch YouTube are Linux servers. Or that Linux is in
most of the world's set-top-boxes already. As we pointed out in an
UpFront piece last month, it's even in the new Sony Bravia flat screens too.
</p><p>
But,
those solutions are all locked up. We need the open ones now&mdash;ones
that let people produce and distribute whatever they want, any way
they want, without the need to live within the channel-bound framework
of the old closed world of television's &ldquo;content distribution&rdquo;. We need
Google, Amazon and other big &ldquo;back-end&rdquo; services to store our produced
goods and distribute them agnostically&mdash;that is, without subordinating us
to back-room dealings with Hollywood.
</p><p>
That's where the rub
will come in. After TV as we know it fails in February, look for
Hollywood to do new deals with the cable and phone carriers. The deal
will be to create a two-tiered Internet&mdash;one in which the fast part
will be a new TV transmission system to replace the old one. On the
receiving end of Hollywood bucks will be AT&amp;T, Comcast, Cox, Time-Warner and Verizon. The end result will be big downstream bandwidth
for Big Content, and few if any upstream improvements for
&ldquo;consumers&rdquo;.
</p><p>
We
have to fight that. There will be much call for taking the fight to
Congress, but the more important battle will be in our own brains,
where we'll need to come up with inventions that mother necessity for a
symmetrical, unbiased Internet that works as a pure utility for
everybody. If we succeed, the Linux Way wins. If we fail, we'll get TV
2.0. Sadly, it will be built on Linux too.
