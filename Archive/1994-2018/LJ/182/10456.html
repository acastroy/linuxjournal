Are four hacks better than one? This month, check out four short Linux
tips that will save you time and effort (or just rotate your X display like
a top).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2003580.0x20fb3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It was exactly one year ago when I wrote my first Lightning Hacks
column. The column was inspired by lightning talks that often occur
at conferences. In a lightning talk, instead of one speaker giving a
presentation for an hour, different people give 5&ndash;10-minute
presentations. The idea is that many people are working on cool projects
but may not have an hour's worth of material to present. And, the audience
gets a rapid-fire presentation of a few different topics instead of one
long lecture.
</p><p>
The idea behind lightning hacks is similar&mdash;I can cover
some quick hacks I think are interesting but that don't warrant a full
column. For example, in the first Lightning Hacks column [June 2008], I talked
about an expanded wmctrl script that reset all of my windows to default
locations and sizes, another script that toggled my laptop output for
when I connect to a projector, and finally, I discussed how to use rdiff
to create small diff files for large binaries. Now that a year has passed,
I think it's time for lightning to strike twice.

Change to Your Previous Directory</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a quick one. I've mentioned this trick to a number of people, and
I get one of two responses. This is one of those tricks (like
Ctrl-R shell expansion in bash) that you either already know about and seems
obvious to you, or one that you can't believe took so long to discover.
</p><p>
If you have spent a lot of time on the command line, you probably
have heard about the pushd and popd scripts. These scripts let you create a
stack that you can push directories on to and later pop them when you
want to return to a previous directory. This script is cool, except you
have to know in advance you want to save a directory and push it, so
you can pop it later&mdash;I never seem to remember. Generally speaking, what
I need is some quick way to go back to my previous directory. Lucky for
me, bash's cd has this feature built in. All I do is type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd -
</pre>
</p><p>
Bash keeps track of your current working directory in the $CWD variable
and your previous directory in $OLDPWD. If you type <tt  >cd
-</tt>, bash 
substitutes - with $OLDPWD. Although you certainly could just type
<tt  >cd $OLDPWD</tt>,
<tt  >cd -</tt> is faster and easier to remember.

SSH Key One-Liner</h2></div></div><p>
If you have to manage a lot of servers or run remote scripts in cron,
SSH keys are a lifesaver. It's so nice to be able
to <tt  >ssh</tt> to a machine
and instantly log in without typing a password. Of course, one of the
more annoying parts of the process can be setting up the SSH keys on
the remote host. Typically, the process goes something like this: run
<tt  >ssh-keygen</tt> locally, <tt  >scp</tt> the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the remote server,
then <tt  >ssh</tt> to the remote server and append that key to your remote
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.
</p><p>
The above method works, but if you can do the entire thing with a
one-liner, why wouldn't you? Here's the SSH one-liner that will copy your
local SSH key to the remote host, so you have to type the password
only once in the whole process:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh user@server.example.net "cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" 
 &#8618;&lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2003580.0x20fbcf8"></a>
Image Drives over SSH</h2></div></div><p>
Many great imaging tools are available, but for me, it's still hard
to beat dd (unless your drive is dying, in which case you should use
ddrescue). It is such a powerful, blunt, ancient UNIX tool, it's hard not
to love it. These days, I don't image too many drives. I use kickstart
for server deployments and rsync when I want to migrate files. That said,
I still do image drives when I want to perform forensics on the host.
</p><p>
One problem you often have when you image drives is that your server
might be in a data center hundreds or thousands of miles away. Even
if the server is close by, you might not be able to add an extra drive
on the fly. In either case, most sysadmins end up imaging the drive over
the network. Traditionally, this was done via netcat, but these days, you
always have to figure out some port you can use that won't be blocked by
the firewall. Another problem is that netcat will transmit potentially
sensitive data over the network in plain text. The modern solution to
this problem is to use SSH. Many servers now have SSH running and
available out of the box, and with modern processor speeds, the encryption
overhead shouldn't be too bad either.
</p><p>
The one-liner to image drives over SSH works much like the one I used for
SSH keys above. It takes advantage of the fact that if you pipe data or
redirect input to SSH on the command line, it will forward it to the remote
connection. So, if I wanted to image /dev/sda on my local machine to a
file called /media/disk1/sda-image.img on server.example.net, I would type
the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda | ssh user@server.example.net "cat 
 &#8618;&gt; /media/disk1/sda-image.img"
</pre>
</p><p>
If I didn't want to image to a file and instead wanted to image
directly to a drive on server.example.net, I simply could replace
/media/disk1/sda-image.img with that device file (I just would need to
log in as root).
</p><p>
Because you can image a drive over SSH, it makes sense that you can use a
variation on the command to restore your image back to a drive. Here's
the inverted version of the above command that I would use if I wanted to
restore the /media/disk1/sda-image.img image I created back to /dev/sda:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh user@server.example.net "cat /media/disk1/sda-image.img" 
 &#8618;| sudo dd of=/dev/sda
</pre>

Rotate Your Screen Around and Around</h2></div></div><p>
My laptop doubles as a tablet, and even though I don't use the tablet mode
very often, when I do use it, I like to be able to rotate the screen
around to portrait mode and back. Now, dock applications exist that
can do this with a few clicks, and I always could just try to remember
the right xrandr commands, but instead, I wrote a little script that
I then bound to one of the hardware buttons on my laptop display. Each
time I press the button, it runs the script and rotates the screen another
90 degrees.
</p><p>
The key to the script is to keep track of your current orientation. When
xrandr rotates, it rotates only left, right, inverted or normal, so if
you already are rotated to the left and rotate left again, it won't
change. To accomplish this, I just write the current orientation to a
temporary file. Listing 1 shows the full script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2003580.0x20fc278"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Screen Rotation Script</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

export ORIENTATION=`cat /tmp/.orientation`

if [ $ORIENTATION -eq "90" ]; then
        xrandr --auto
        xrandr --output LVDS --rotate inverted 
        echo 180 &gt; /tmp/.orientation
        echo "180" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center \
        --pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 \
        --font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 \
	--offset 40 &amp;
elif [ $ORIENTATION -eq "180" ]; then
        xrandr --auto
        xrandr --output LVDS --rotate left 
        echo 270 &gt; /tmp/.orientation
        echo "270" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center \
        --pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 \
        --font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 \
        --offset 40 &amp;
elif [ $ORIENTATION -eq "270" ]; then
        xrandr --output LVDS --rotate normal 
        echo "Normal" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center \
        --pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 \
        --font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 \
        --offset 40 &amp;
        echo 0 &gt; /tmp/.orientation
else
        xrandr --auto
        xrandr --output LVDS --rotate right 
        echo 90 &gt; /tmp/.orientation
        echo "90" | osd_cat --shadow=2 --align=center \
        --pos=bottom --color=green --delay=2 \
        --font=lucidasanstypewriter-bold-24 \
        --offset 40 &amp;
fi

</pre></div><p>
Notice in Listing 1 that I also added an echo piped to osd_cat. This is optional and
just displays the current orientation on my screen. If you want to use
this, be sure you have the osd_cat utility (it's included with the
xosd-bin package in Debian and Ubuntu). The way the script is set up, it
will run through each of the orientations in order before it goes back
to normal. Because the temporary file will be deleted any time the machine
reboots, I made sure to set the default mode to rotate 90 degrees.
