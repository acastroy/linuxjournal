    AX is a replacement X-Windows or X-11 server
    based on X11R5 and is available for most 386-, 486-, and Pentium-based
    UNIX systems (including our favorite&mdash;Linux).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a8580.0x25a0348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Accelerated-X (AX) Graphical Display
Server version 1.1 is sold by X-Inside Incorporated. AX is a
replacement X-Windows or X-11 server based on X11R5 and is
available for most 386-, 486-, and Pentium-based UNIX systems
(including our favorite&mdash;Linux).
</p><p>The AX product is under continuous development, and as of
this writing is available as AX version 1.2 Beta/4 for beta testers
and AX version 1.1 for users who wish to purchase the current
stable version (1.1). The product arrived in a plain white envelope
which contained a single 1.44MB diskette, a single 3/8 inch-thick
User Guide, and a two-page release note.</p><p>System requirements: any 386/486/Pentium system with 4MB of
memory, Linux, at least 4MB of free disk space under /usr, a mouse,
and a supported graphics board and monitor (more about this
later).</p><p>System recommendations: any 386/486/Pentium system with at
least 8MB of memory more than the OS requires, a 3-button mouse,
swap space which is 2/3 times the amount of system memory, and a
high-end graphics card and monitor.</p><p>As a general recommendation, X-inside suggests, as do I, that
you get the XFree86 distribution and get it working in at least one
graphics mode for your system. You will at least need the XFree86
distribution installed, as AX is only a server, not a complete X
distribution.</p><p>Before you start, you will need the graphics board name and
vendor, the amount of graphics memory, the graphics chip set, the
display capabilities of the board; the monitor name and vendor, the
maximum resolution, and maximum refresh rate; the national language
of the keyboard in use, the mouse name and vendor, whether the
mouse is 2 or 3 button, and the mouse interface (and if it uses a
serial interface, then you will need the name of the serial device
the mouse is using).</p><p>With this information, the install action is simple and
straightforward. As root, insert the diskette,
<b  >cd /usr/X386/lib/X11</b>
, then
<b  >tar -xvzf /dev/fd0</b>
 (assuming your 1.44MB is /dev/fd0). Next, run the install script
<b  >AcceleratedX/bin/Xinstall</b>
, which creates two directories, /usr/X11/bin/Xaccel and
/usr/X11/bin/Xsetup, then renames the existing X server to
/usr/X11/bin/X.LINUX and makes a link from /usr/X11/bin/X to the
Xaccel server. Lastly, run Xsetup to choose your graphics board,
chip set, resolution modes, mouse, etc., to create the
configuration file /etc/Xaccel.ini. When you exit Xsetup, you are
ready to run AX.</p><p>Don't make any other changes to your system or to X-Windows.
Furthermore, AX is even set up to be uninstall friendly. Xinside
provides a script AcceleratedX/bin/Xuninstall which does the bulk
of the work. Several files are still left on your system which you
must remove by hand&mdash;/etc/Xaccel.ini and any $HOME/.Xaccel.ini
files in user directories.</p><p>I took the time to run some benchmarks with the xbench suite
to determine if the manufacturer's claims were real (up to 450,000
xstones and getting faster everyday). The test system was a
486/DX33 with 16MB of memory and VLB. I tested a ISA ET-4000 (9427
xstones), ISA Orchid F1280 (59,189 xstones), and a VLB Genoa
Phantom ET4000/W32 (112,442 xstones). The benchmark numbers that
were generated matched very well with those available from Xinside.
Therefore, I feel that Xinside's benchmarks are true and believable
(for more information, see their WWW site, send them e-mail, or
call them). Generally, I found that AX produced a speed increase
between 10 and 500 percent in various X-Window operations with
higher performance gains dependent on better (read &ldquo;more
expensive&rdquo;) graphics boards in comparison to XFree86. The AX server
has direct support for almost all of the high-end graphics boards
(in the price range of $250-$2500).</p><p>The most amazing part of the AX product is the configuration
(or the re-configuration) process. Xsetup is a menu-driven
configuration program. Simply choose your graphics board/chip set,
resolution, etc., and the Xsetup program does the rest. AX has
graphics board support for 170 different boards and over 36
monitors. If, however, you decide you need written instructions,
the user manual provides fourteen pages of configuration details
and about forty pages of technical details. I am pleased to say I
did not need to use the manual. Xsetup and AX did what I
expected.</p><p>The environment for which I use Linux and X-Windows often
requires changing graphics boards and graphics monitors. Before AX,
I might spend one-half of a day just reconfiguring X-Windows
(especially for each new graphics card and monitor combination).
After AX, it took about 2-5 minutes to reconfigure (generally, it
took more time to close the computer case than to
reconfigure).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>AX</b></span> has support for a variety
of hardware that I did not get a chance to test, but does warrant
mention. Most notably, AX contains multi-headed X-server support
which allows up to 8 graphics cards to be installed and in use and
permits the cursor to be moved from one screen to another
(generally, each screen is displayed on its own monitor). Each
board may have different resolutions and depths. Generally, all
displays share all pointing devices. AX also has built-in support
for graphics digitizing tablets which allows you to use a tablet
instead of a mouse. Most common tablets are supported.</p><p>While AX is a good product, it is not perfect (but who can
honestly say their software is bug free?). One of the mice I used
during testing was not correctly identified as being a three-button
mouse (instead it functioned as a two-button variety). This
<span   class="bold"><b>only</b></span> happened after a cold boot;
otherwise it was identified correctly. Also, the release notes warn
that the VGA console may be set to a non-standard character mode
(i.e. other than 80x25 mode) during the Linux boot. If you are
running in such a mode, upon returning from AX your console will
have its contents skewed. Currently, there is no workaround from
AX. Xinside suggests that you use the 80x25 standard mode and does
not consider this a bug because they have valid technical reasons
for this behavior which they will explain to technically curious
users.</p><p>I have been running AX for several months (during this review
process) and have not had a single problem with compatibility or
with stability. The AX product just seems to work. If your system
requirement includes high performance X-Window graphics, then you
should be taking a serious look at AX. To receive more information,
