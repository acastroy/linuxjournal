    This year, an entire track was devoted to Linux, and Linus's
    presence was
    announced in a front-page article in the show daily,
    Update.Daily.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2858580.0x2950240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last year, DECUS (Digital Equipment
Computer User Society) surprised some people by bringing Linus
Torvalds to New Orleans to give two short talks about Linux. Why
Linux at a Digital-oriented trade show? What did Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) and DECUS care about Linux? Why would DECUS
members be interested in hearing Linus Torvalds talk about Linux?
</p><p>This year, an entire track was devoted to Linux, and Linus's
presence was announced in a front-page article in the show daily,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Update.Daily</em></span>. The Linux-related sessions were
well-attended, not only by Linux die-hards, but also by fans of
Digital Unix (n&eacute;e OSF/1), OpenVMS, and even Windows NT.
Why?</p><p>Part of the answer is that DEC has not only given Linus a
computer with DEC's new Alpha CPU in order to port Linux to it, but
is actively sponsoring it, supporting it, and participating in it
at the corporate level. One of DEC's booths included an Alpha-based
system running Linux/Alpha as a demonstration of the success they
have had with the ongoing port, and it was well received. Although
the X Windowing System and networking are not yet running,
Linux/Alpha is now &ldquo;self-hosting&rdquo; (meaning you can compile the
Alpha kernel on the Alpha under Linux), and DEC projects an
end-user release sometime this fall.</p><p>When asked why DEC was participating so heavily in porting a
free operating system&mdash;one which could be perceived as a competitor
to other DEC operating systems, especially Digital Unix&mdash;to the
Alpha, Jon &ldquo;Maddog&rdquo; Hall, Senior Leader in the Digital Unix
Marketing Group, said, &ldquo;It was inevitable. Either I got the Alpha
for Linus, or he was going to do the port to the PowerPC... DEC can
either try and stop it and look foolish and stupid, or they can
help it along and look like heroes.&rdquo;</p><p>Jim Paradis, Principal Software Engineer of the Alpha AXP
Migration Tools and the leader of the DEC team working on the Linux
port, agreed. &ldquo;If we didn't do it, <span   class="emphasis"><em>somebody</em></span>
was going to do it. When you have a hot chip like Alpha in low-cost
platforms, and a low-cost operating system like Linux, sooner or
later, someone is going to want to put the two together. We can
either be ahead of the curve or behind the curve.&rdquo;</p><p>He also said that DEC needed a smaller operating system than
Digital Unix, OpenVMS, or Windows NT, and they considered porting
the system then known as Chicago (currently &ldquo;Windows 95&rdquo;) to the
Alpha. However, Linux was considered a better choice, not only
because it is technically superior, but also because Linux has
become so popular that many users will purchase an Alpha instead of
some other high-performance CPU such as a Pentium or
PowerPC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2858580.0x29505b0"></a>Guru</h2></div></div><p>Linus himself gave several talks, including a DC-area Linux
User's Group session Tuesday night, a highly-publicized &ldquo;featured
presentation&rdquo; Wednesday afternoon, and a 5-hour Linux tutorial on
Thursday. His talk on Wednesday was part of a series of 10 talks
throughout the day on various Linux-related topics, and was an
introduction to Linux. His well-attended tutorial was, essentially,
a technical session which gave an overview of the Linux kernel. All
of Linus' talks included question and answer sessions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2858580.0x29506b8"></a>A Panel</h2></div></div><p>The last session Wednesday was a panel discussion with
several panelists, including Linus. In reality, the entire audience
became the panel, and talked about relevant issues, including how
local Linux users' groups (LUGS) can be helpful both for Linux
users and for spreading Linux. Linus pointed out that what Linux
really needs now is more mainstream commercial applications.
Following are other Linux talks that took place on Wednesday:
Digital and the Linux Operating System; Introducing Linux on Alpha;
Parallel Processing with Linux and Transputers at YSU; Linux: Past,
Present and Future; Linux in the Real World&mdash;A Powerful Idea;
Distributed Computing with Linux on the Beowulf Parallel
Workstation; Publishing and the Linux Market; Painless GUI
Programming in Linux OS; Writing Linux Device Drivers; Linux: What
is it Good for.

significant and surprising interest in Linux. At trade shows, we
often see seasoned Unix users who are interested in Linux, but at
DECUS, we saw a very large number of VMS users, including DEC
employees, who expressed strong interest in using Linux. Also, the
Linux BOF (Birds-Of-a-Feather) session was attended by diverse
users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2858580.0x2950920"></a>Next Year</h2></div></div><p>The Linux track was so successful that an even larger track
is being planned for December 2-7, 1995 at the Moscone Center in
San Francisco. DECUS `95/San Francisco will include the possible
mbone broadcast of sessions for those with high-bandwidth internet
connections who can't make it to the show. The show promises to
have more sessions, more symposia, and (we hope) more vendors.
