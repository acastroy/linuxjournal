    This month, Dean takes some time off to play and reports his
    successes and failures.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afa580.0x1bf2450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have to start this month's article with
an apology. The original introduction focused on Unix as a mature
operating system but one that lacked maturity in the area of
entertainment. After a week of exploring the variety of Unix games,
I realized my mistake. Unix games may not be as profitable or
numerous as DOS games but they have been tremendously influential,
and that needs mention.
</p><p>The first popular games started on the mainframes.
&ldquo;Adventure&rdquo; spawned &ldquo;Zork&rdquo;, which spawned the adventure game
industry. On the strategy side, I believe Empire was translated
from the mainframe. Mac and MS-DOS versions met with great success.
Empire also influenced the strategy genre by combining a &ldquo;conquer
an unknown world&rdquo; motif with multi-player capability, an influence
that, in part, resulted in Warlords II, one of my favorite strategy
games. Even today, Unix is still a major influence on the gaming
world, via the Internet, through Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs). These
interactive sessions began the requirement now for many non-Unix
games, that they allow for multiple players over a modem or
network. Many on-line services are now offering multi-player
versions of the most popular MS-DOS games.</p><p>Novice to Novice will take a little recreational detour this
month and explore a variety of games that may come with Linux disks
or CDs. In my case, Slackware Professional 2.1. The eventual goal
of this article will be to get DOOM running and use a Sound Blaster
16 because DOOM without the gruesome sounds of unbridled carnage
just isn't right.</p><p>Slackware allows you to install two sets of games. One set,
&ldquo;Y&rdquo;, contains the BSD games collection and a Tetris clone. The
other set, &ldquo;XAP&rdquo;, contains X-Windows applications and includes some
games like GNU chess and xboard (which allows you to run the ASCII
GNU chess in X).</p><p>I loaded the BSD collection and soon after removed it, with
one exception: Mille, a clone of Parker Brothers' popular card game
Mille Borne. The binary found on the main Slackware disk had a bug
that occurred when the game was extended. Sometimes there'd be an
annoying buzzing lockup. However, I found a version on the tsx-11
archive disk that ran smoother. Very addictive!</p><p>There are more games than the BSD compilation available. If
you snoop around on any of the archive CDs you're bound to find
gold. When I found something of interest, I would copy it over to
/usr/local/games. It seemed like an appropriate spot to put things.
[/usr/games is for games that are installed by the system;
/usr/local/games is a good choice for user-installed games
&mdash;ED]</p><p>The Sunsite disk had a plethora of games conveniently divided
into general categories like action, strategy, X11, and RPG
(role-playing games) which was a major stopping point for me. The
names sounded familiar. Some of the games like Rogue, Moria, and
(Net-) Hack have been successfully translated to DOS, and in at
least one case, given a major facelift. For example, SSI's Dungeon
Hack is directly evolved from Hack but redone with SuperVGA
graphics and a variety of other additions.</p><p>For the heck of it, I copied over Rogue. Any game with a name
like my favorite comic book heroine automatically gets special
consideration. The version I copied was 5.3pl2. Besides the source
code, the archive had a precompiled binary, which I appreciated,
but when I ran it, it crashed: &ldquo;missing library&rdquo;. Fine. I compiled
the source cleanly and ran the new binary. It ran for a few
keystrokes before stopping from &ldquo;segmentation faults&rdquo;. Sigh! I
dismissed Rogue and looked for other entertainment.</p><p>I found something called Omega (version 0.78.1) on the TSX-11
CD that I thought would be like the DOS tank programming game of
the same name; instead, it was another Hack clone. This one, unlike
Rogue, ran well and my wife had to drag me away after a half hour
of playing. It's easy to forget that you don't always need snazzy
graphics to produce a deep game. ASCII role-playing games like this
amaze me with their detail. Sure, you can add graphics, but then
that 500K game explodes into multi-megabytes of size. Also, a
keyboard interface can allow you a greater variety of options,
which Omega has, than a mouse-based interface cluttering up a
graphics screen. The problem is simply remembering the overwhelming
number of commands, but a printout of the help file solves that
easily enough.</p><p>Chess! I've always loved chess, not just the game but the
lore and history around it. Since I had installed GNUchess and
xboard, well, how about a game of chess? I ran GNUchess straight up
and got the ASCII board, moved a few pieces, and lost. Admittedly
my chess rating, if I had one, would be somewhere in the low
hundreds. But GNUchess worked! Now for the X-Windows interface. I
activated my swapfile, entered X-Windows, called up an Xterm shell,
and typed in <b  >xboard</b>. Quickly a rather pretty
chess board appeared. Quickly my hard drive started whirring. I
made my first move and the opponent's clock started its countdown
from 5 minutes. The hard disk continued to go berserk for 2.5
minutes before I destroyed it out of mercy. This long amount of
time for the first move was unacceptable. Perhaps it was the
swapfile. I exited X-Windows, shut off the swap, and tried xboard
again. This time the board appeared along with an error message
about &ldquo;GNUchessx exited unexpectedly&rdquo;. Sigh! So much for chess.
[Adding more swap would have solved the problem with xboard.
&mdash;ED]</p><p>I discovered Empire (Chainsaw version 3.12) under &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;
and debated compiling it. The README mentioned that it would
require TCP/IP among other things. Sure Linux has that and more,
but I backed down from compiling. I wasn't hooked up to any
network; I just wanted to see what one of these games looked like
without having to compile anything. Luckily, I found Conquest
(5.5.1a) which, after copying to / and unarchiving, produced an
executable game with little modification necessary. Running
X-Windows and calling up Xterm, I typed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xset +fp /usr/X386/lib/X11/fonts/misc/xconq
xset fp rehash
</pre><p>to set some appropriate paths; entering xconq produced a
large window showing a very complex game. No help file was
immediately available from within the game so, after moving a few
pieces, I exited. Besides, it was a network game so I really
couldn't have gotten the full experience from it, playing alone.
</p><p>A strong case for Unix games is that for many you get the
source code. If the game is too easy or too hard, or needs a
wandering wizard&mdash;rewrite it! The only answer to this from the DOS
side of things is the occasional release of construction sets.
Generally, however, these sets do not allow you to change all
aspects of a game, just what the designers will allow you to
change. That's not quite like having the source code. The negative
side is having the source code and not having it compile cleanly.
To an expert hacker, this presents no obstacle&mdash;dive into the code
and make corrections, but for novices, it's agony. That's why, when
some of the above games crashed, I moved on. And on that line of
thought...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afa580.0x1bf2a28"></a>On to DOOM!</h2></div></div><p>On the primary Slackware disk, I found an untarred,
unarchived DOOM v1.666 under /usr/games/doom. Also, I found an
archived version under /sunsite/games/X11/action/doom. Eager to
play, I copied the four files (a README, a sound driver, the data
file and the binary) to my own /usr/games/doom. Setting my swap
file active, I launched into X-Windows, opened a terminal window,
went to the proper subdirectory, typed
<b  >linuxxdoom</b> and waited. The terminal window
showed the familiar DOOM launch lines.
</p><p>I waited. My hard drive started grinding. Terminal messages
gave a variety of errors which I assumed would be related to the
lack of a sound driver.</p><p>And waited. A minute passed and the hard drive was going
berserk. Anxiety crept into the room and waited to pounce.</p><p>And waited. A small window appeared. The opening screen of
DOOM kind of showed up. It looked horribly dark and grainy, but
when I clicked the mouse button, the background to X-Windows
changed colors and the DOOM window suddenly, dramatically cleared
up.</p><p>I was in DOOM! The movement was, surprisingly, a little
jerky. I brightened up the screen via the F11 key (gamma
correction). Yes, this was DOOM. I played for a bit and then quit.
DOOM without the gruesome sound is gruesome itself.</p><p>The DOOM readme suggests using version 3.0 of Hannu's sound
driver but fails to tell where it can be located. The Sound HOW-TO
mentions using a shell script found in
/usr/src/linux/drivers/sound/Readme.linux, except that no such
subdirectory or file existed in my setup. Snooping with mc
(Midnight Commander) in /dev, I noticed many empty files including
/dev/dsp, which is used for sound. I also noticed and read through
the MAKEDEV file and decided to try it.</p><p>Entering <b  >MAKEDEV audio</b> did nothing&mdash;at
least, nothing that I could see. The files still remained at size
0. [Device files are always 0-sized. Device files are also
sometimes called &ldquo;special files&rdquo;, for good reason&mdash;ED]</p><p>Yes, this has all the makings of a minor crisis. Re-reading
the Sound HOW-TO reveals the bad news: recompile the kernel to
support sound. No, no, NO! What did I do to deserve this? I just
wanted to play Doom with sound. Having to recompile the kernel just
to get sound had to be insane, but it seemed that this simple
yearning for DOOM had to develop into a learning experience.
[Actually, recompiling your very own kernel allows you to make a
smaller kernel, which gives you more memory to work with, which
means that more of the games will work without the massive swapping
experienced here&mdash;ED]</p><p>After a day of blaspheming a variety of Linux gods (primary
and many secondary), I calmed down to tackle recompiling the
kernel. The first thing I did was copy the remaining kernel source
code from the &ldquo;D&rdquo; set on the CD-ROM. The kernel had been split into
three archives, and I had already copied over the third archive as
a recommended part of general installation. Admittedly, I found it
quite cool that I could fiddle with the source code if I so
chose&mdash;something I know I'll <span   class="bold"><b>never</b></span>
experience with Windows or DOS.</p><p>Next: I read the manual. It mentioned creating two
links:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -sf /usr/src/linux/include /usr/include/linux
# ln -sf /usr/src/linux/asm /usr/include/asm
</pre><p>which I changed to match what appeared under my /usr/src. I
typed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ln -sf /usr/src/linux-1.1.59/include \
/usr/include/linux
# ln -sf /usr/src/linux-1.1.59/asm \
/usr/include/asm
</pre><p>which worked for me.</p><p>After setting the links, I switched to /usr/src/linux-1.1.59
and entered <b  >make config</b>, which prompted me with
a barrage of questions. For the most part, I accepted the default
answers except when it came to SCSI, CD setup (I chose the Sony
cdu31a option) and sound. Since I don't have any SCSI devices, I
opted to eliminate that ability. For sound, I first accepted the
default of all sound options, but when configuring the individual
parts, a non-SoundBlaster value conflicted with something I
specified for my Blaster. The program stopped because of that. I
restarted the configuration and this time chose not to fully
install all sound options. This way I got to pick just the
SoundBlaster options and configure for them.</p><p>After the make <b  >config finished</b>, I typed
<b  >make dep</b> which (according to the System
Administration Guide) fixes all of the source dependencies. No
problems here.</p><p>Finally the big moment: <b  >make Image</b> to
create the actual image. No, it stopped, saying the command wasn't
supported anymore and instead to type <b  >make
zImage</b> to create a compressed version.</p><p>I did so and the computer started grinding away. About ten
minutes later it crashed: lack of virtual memory. Dumb error on my
part! Setting my swap file active with <b  >swapon
/swap</b>, I restarted the compiling and relaxed as the
grinding began.</p><p>And continued. 5 minutes. 10 minutes. 30 minutes. About an
hour later it finished and <span   class="bold"><b>finished
cleanly</b></span>. No problems! My chest puffed out in manly
pride, and I drank deeply from a virtual beer.</p><p>Now what to do with the two resulting files called
zSystem.map and zImage? Using <span   class="bold"><b>mc</b></span>,
I found a similar zSystem.map under /boot. I renamed it and copied
the new one in its place. A quick perusal of the System
Administrators Guide revealed that sometimes the kernel is called
vmlinuz and sure enough I found such a file under /. I renamed it
and copied zImage as vmlinuz to /.</p><p>[This was enough because Dean uses UMSDOS and does not use
LILO. The majority of Linux users, who use LILO to boot, will need
to run <span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span> in order to make their
new kernel bootable. Many documents, including the article Dean
mentions below, document how to do this&mdash;ED]</p><p>The new kernel turned out smaller&mdash;about two-thirds the size
of the old kernel. Hopefully this will translate into a slight gain
in speed. I also discovered&mdash;actually I remembered&mdash;that
<i  >Linux Journal</i> had an article in Issue 7 about
compiling the kernel, called &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Performance Tuning
for the Faint of Heart</em></span>&rdquo;. A quick review revealed that I
answered the various kernel questions correctly. Very comforting
and also informative. The article explained many of the default
choices.</p><p>Time for the real test: shutdown Linux and reboot. The kernel
loaded cleanly and apparently recognized the SoundBlaster. Great! I
set up the swap file, fired up X-Windows, called up a term window,
got into /usr/games/doom and ran <b  >linuxxdoom</b>. It
did its stuff, grinding and YES, YES, YES, DOOOOOOOOM WITH
SOUND!!!!! It worked!</p><p>For a while, I thought it wouldn't work because there were
many error messages during loading saying &ldquo;<b  >can't find
lumpname ( )</b>&rdquo;, but it worked!</p><p>Now, one more thing to test: whether DOOM would allow me to
use an alternate .WAD file (data file) with the game. One of the
great appeals of Doom is that the program allows you to use other
data files, thus giving you good value for your $US40. People have
created 1000s of new levels, sounds, and effects for Doom, Doom II,
and the newest family member, Heretic. I doubted that I could use
an alternate WAD with this shareware version of Doom because it is
version 1.666. Supposedly, the earlier 1.2 version did have the
external WAD support, but that meant users wouldn't necessarily buy
the full version. Id Software, the publishers, removed that ability
in the later shareware versions. Only registered users get to enjoy
swapping WADs. I happen to have a WAD handy, so let's try it
out:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
doom -devparm -file acheron.wad -wart 1 3
</pre><p>The program starts and ends quickly. As I expected the
shareware DOOM v1.666 won't run external WADs. I can vouch that the
registered Unix version will allow that ability (having played it
on a friend's Sun network).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1afa580.0x1bf39a0"></a>A Parting Rant</h2></div></div><p>Unix, for all its maturity as an operating system, still
lacks success in the entertainment field primarily because
businesses and schools, the primary users of Unix, don't require
it. Not to deny that Unix hasn't influenced the gaming field&mdash;it
undeniably has. But Unix still is sold as a high-end solution and
hence is priced out of the home market where the entertainment
market has its largest hold. Besides, why would anyone run Unix at
home?</p><p>And yet, with Linux, a compact and essentially free Unix, the
home market opens up. If Linux, or any other similar operating
system, can create a valid and popular niche in the home market
then the scenario changes. With the home market opened up, we see a
fantastic new potential for Unix-based entertainment.</p><p>Anybody want to design a killer Linux game?</p></div></div>
