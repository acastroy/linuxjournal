    A look at two popular Motif for Linux distributions, GUI
    Corporation's
    SWiM Motif 2.0 and Metro Link Inc.'s Motif 2.0.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17bd580.0x18b53a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most frequently asked
questions in the Usenet Linux newsgroups is &ldquo;Motif for Linux?&rdquo;.
Why? To answer that, I should first explain a little about what
Motif is and why it is in such demand in the Linux community.
</p><p>Motif is a set of programming libraries and header files,
copyrighted by the Open Software Foundation (OSF), which allow
programmers to create X programs using the Motif &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo;.
Similar to the Athena toolkit (libXaw), the Motif toolkit (libXm)
is also based on the Xt toolkit (the X &ldquo;Intrinsics&rdquo;), but the Motif
toolkit has a distinct 3-D look to it which makes it much more
pleasant-looking. Motif also includes a window manager called
<span   class="bold"><b>Mwm</b></span> which, as of version 2.0,
allows virtual desktops, a feature that users of earlier versions
of Motif have wanted for a long time. Many people think of Motif
and Mwm as the same thing, but Mwm is really just a small part of
Motif. Motif is accepted as the standard X toolkit by major Unix
vendors like IBM and HP, so it seems natural that Linux users want
to use Motif on Linux platforms as well.</p><p>Even if you don't ever intend to develop Motif applications,
having Motif on your system will be useful. Having access to the
Motif shared libraries, which are included with Linux Motif
distributions, will allow you to compile many freely-available
Motif applications with shared Motif library support, resulting in
much smaller binaries which take up significantly less memory than
statically-linked binaries which you can retrieve from the Internet
or copy from CD-ROMs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17bd580.0x18b55b0"></a>Which Motif for Linux?</h2></div></div><p>This is another frequently asked question by Linux users. Two
of the more popular Motif for Linux distributions, GUI
Corporation's SWiM Motif 2.0 and Metro Link Inc.'s Motif 2.0, are
reviewed here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17bd580.0x18b56b8"></a>Metro Link</h2></div></div><p>Motif 2.0 for Linux from Metro Link consists of five 3.5"
disks, a quick installation guide, and the OSF Motif 2.0 User's
Guide booklet. The user needs to have the XFree86 3.1.1 libraries
already installed and a minimum of 8 MB RAM for things to work.
Included on the disks are the Motif man pages, source to the
OSF/Motif demos, precompiled binaries, Mwm, shared and static
libraries, header files, the Uil compiler, Mrm, some extra
utilities such as a pixmap editor, an xbm browser utility, and a
huge set of colored pixmaps. Metro Link also includes the Xpm
pixmap library, which OSF requires for building Motif 2.0 apps.
</p><p>The installation is completely trivial as long as you follow
the quick installation guide. Simply extract the files from the
disks, untar them, and you're ready to play. The product takes up
anywhere from 20 to 30 MB of disk space, depending on whether you
wish to install the sources to the man pages. I chose not to, since
the preformatted cat pages were also provided, and it saved some
disk space.</p><p>Having everything installead, I proceeded to compile Mosaic,
xmcd, and a bunch of other free Motif apps available on the net.
Everything went smoothly, xmkmf working flawlessly with Metro
Link's new Imake.rules, Motif.rules, and Motif.tmpl files. Not one
problem. I also decided to build the included OSF/Motif demos, and
that also worked out painlessly. I was a very happy camper. I
actually expected something to go wrong, but that never happened.
<span   class="bold"><b>Mwm</b></span>, the window manager, also ran
smoothly, although on an 8 MB machine that might not be true.
Compiling Motif apps on an 8 MB machine will also probably be very
slow, but on my 16 MB machine (the recommended RAM amount)
everything worked great. Metro Link offers free technical support
for Motif 2.0 by phone, fax, and e-mail, but I can't tell you how
good the support is because I never had to use it. I never ran into
any problems with their product.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17bd580.0x18b58c8"></a>SWiM</h2></div></div><p>Next up is GUI Corporation's SWiM Motif 2.0. The main
distributors are ACC Corp. (U.S.) and Lasermoon Ltd (Europe). SWiM
Motif 2.0 ships on CD. Also included are the OSF Motif 2.0 User's
Guide booklet and an installation guide. Similar to Metro Link's
distribution, SWiM also includes Mwm, shared and static libraries,
header files, Uil compiler, Mrm, man pages, and source to the
OSF/Motif demos. In addition, the SWiM CD includes the source to
all OSF Motif 2.0 documentation, including the Motif 2.0
Programmer's Manual, X11R5 and ELF shared libraries (as well as
X11R6 ones), the complete XFree86 3.1.1 distribution, live file
systems for XFree86 3.1.1 and SWiM Motif 2.0, and an archive of
over 300 MB of Motif programs gathered from different places. The
distribution takes about the same disk space as Metro Link's, and
the memory requirements are the same.
</p><p>After mounting the CD, I proceeded to install SWiM. The
installation guide that I had was geared towards a floppy disk
installation, based on SWiM's previous release which was not on CD.
The README in the top CD directory did not really give any
installation instructions, but after navigating around the
subdirectories, I managed to find the directory with the main
distribution. Along the way I came across directories which had
X11R5 and ELF libs, so I assumed that the default installation was
using X11R6 (XFree 3.1.1) libs. I was right. I then ran the Install
script and everything went well until the script bombed because it
was trying to untar something to the current directory, which was
read-only since it was on the CD. As the last step of the
installation, SWiM is supposed to untar a file (mwm_make.tar) and
then compile mwm from the contents of that file using the shared
Motif libraries that it had installed earlier. Since I was on a
read-only file system it naturally failed. I looked at the Install
script and proceeded to untar the mwm_make.tar file in /tmp and
build mwm there. This worked out and then I was done with the
installation.</p><p>I then started X and Mwm and proceeded to compile some
programs. Everything worked perfectly and smoothly. SWiM comes with
a mxmkmf program (and mx5mkmf for X11R5 users) which replaces xmkmf
when compiling Motif programs using Imake files. For use with
mxmkmf, SWiM also installs new Imake.tmpl, Motif.tmpl, and
Motif.rules files in /usr/lib/X11/config, which are, by default,
for use with X11R6-based distributions.
<span   class="bold"><b>X11R5</b></span> replacements are also
installed in a seperate subdirectory. Instead of running xmkmf, I
ran mxmkmf to compile the demos. Things worked according to
plan.</p><p>I did run into some problems later when trying to use the uil
compiler to produce some uid files required by some of the demo
programs. It seems that SWiM installed an X11R5-based uil binary
during the installation process, even though the distribution was
set up for an X11R6 based system. Since I couldn't find an
X11R6-based uil binary, I had to fetch some X11R5 shared libraries
in order to run the uil compiler&mdash;not too big a deal, but I would
have preferred to have an X11R6 binary. Other than that, and some
of the installation problems, SWiM worked fine. Free technical
support is also available in Europe for SWiM from Lasermoon
Ltd.</p><p>One major difference between SWiM and Metro Link Motif 2.0 is
that while Metro Link's shared Xm library requires linking with the
Xpm library, SWiM's doesn't, since the Xpm library is compiled into
SWiM's Xm library. I mention this difference because shared
binaries compiled with SWiM won't work on a Metro Link system and
vice versa, due to the differences between the shared Xm
libraries.</p><p>At the time of writing this article, the Linux community is
moving towards ELF shared library support from the current a.out
format. The SWiM CD includes ELF shared libraries, but the Metro
Link distribution does not; since ELF libraries are still under
development and changing very rapidly, Metro Link has decided to
wait until ELF is stabilized and in wider use before releasing ELF
libraries with their Motif 2.0 package. By the the time you read
this article, this change will probably have already taken
place.</p><p>[InfoMagic just released Moo-Tiff and it will be reviewed in
