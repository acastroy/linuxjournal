<span   class="emphasis"><em>I would like to get a little background on
you.</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> I grew up in
Connecticut and then got a degree from Duke in North Carolina. I
had a dual major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
Then I went to work at Kodak in Rochester, New York for eight years
working on publishing and printing software. Now I work at
Microsoft.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Did you work
on Unix systems at Kodak?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Yes, we started
working with old Sun systems, possibly Sun 1s and then Sun 2s, Sun
3s and Sun 4s. Thus most of my Unix experience was with the BSD
flavor of Unix. We initially worked with SunView then migrated to
working with X11R4 and Open Look.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>When did you
get involved with Linux? And why?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Version .12 in 1992,
I think. It seems like so long ago. I had played with Minix at home
but didn't see it as being more than something that would run the
ls command. I saw no chance to run X on it. Linux, however, had
real memory management and looked like a possible platform for X
and I wanted to give a port of X to Linux a try.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Did you
consider one of the BSDs as an alternative to
Linux?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Yes, I did, but at
the time BSD required a dedicated machine rather than a partition
on an otherwise MS- DOS disk; it offered no math co-processor
emulation and just seemed less open than Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>So your
first step was to get Linux up and running, and the next step for
you was to port X to Linux?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Right. I saw Linux as
a great platform for running X at home and considered it a good
challenge to get things to work. Also, the number of available apps
for X made having a Linux port very enticing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>What were
the development steps?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> X used a lot of
[Unix] System 5 stuff so I decided that the job was to make Linux
fit X rather than X fit Linux. That is, I started writing the
needed System 5 system calls for Linux. The end result is that the
X server for System 5 and Linux are almost identical. A side
benefit is Linux now includes System 5 as well as BSD
functionality. This has made porting other applications to Linux
fairly easy.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>What were
the problems along the way? And when did things get
exciting?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> X11R5 was stable but
the C libraries for Linux were still evolving, not to mention the
kernel itself. The daily task was more dealing with what worked and
didn't work in the libraries, which were changing quickly, than
doing the actual X development. This was my intent as part of the
make-Linux-fit-X effort.</p><p>I remember that producing a running X server was a great
stress test of both the libraries and the kernel, and we found a
number of subtle bugs and compatibility problems in the
process.</p><p>Because there was no graphical screen code at the time, I
wrote a curses driver so I could test the X server code. Getting
the server working meant that sockets had to work as did networking
and virtual terminals. The big breakthrough was when the server
came up with my curses driver. Because each pixel was represented
as a dot in character mode, all I could see was an 80x24 patch of
the &ldquo;display&rdquo; but there it was: the biggest &ldquo;X&rdquo; cursor in the world
sitting over a huge xterm shell prompt. Huge, but it did
work.</p><p>Once I was at this point, it was fairly easy to then add the
other code to get the video to work in graphics mode. At this
point, the pre-XFree86 team was gearing up (I call it &ldquo;pre-XFree86&rdquo;
because it wasn't called that until much later). David Wexelblat
and David Dawes, along with a small group, decided to actively
support X11R5 on 386 platforms. This was a tremendous boon for
Linux and I never dreamed that XFree86 would become what it is
today.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>The X
development team has a different organizational structure than
Linux. Well, actually, X has a structure, but Linux decisions
really just use the &ldquo;send it to Linus approach&rdquo;. How do you feel
about this?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> XFree development is
more controlled than Linux. They use the BSD method rather than the
Linux method. This has put some people off, but it really isn't a
problem. In fact, it may be better for X development. Linux
development has been very open and we all appreciate that. But
Linux development lends itself more to that sort of environment
than X, where a tighter decision-making mechanism is needed. I
don't think there are any cases where reasonable suggestions have
been ignored. People are always welcome to join the team, but the
level of involvement may scare off those who only wish to dabble.
The current group of active developers spend a lot of time with
XFree86.</p><p>Today, Linux development needs to maintain backward
compability. For that reason I ran the 1.0.9 kernel on my
development system until 1.2 came out so I could make sure that new
code would not break on the last production kernel.</p><p>It is important that Linux offer a stable, reliable path for
upgrading as many of today's users are actually just that: users.
They use Linux as the operating system upon which they run an
application rather than develop software for Linux or modify Linux
itself.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Are you
currently doing any X development?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Yes. I am working on
moving the X distribution to use ELF libraries. The next release of
XFree86, 3.1.2, will probably be a maintenance release where the
main distribution will still use a.out binaries, but ELF binaries
will be included as well.</p><p>I am also doing little things here and there, but it's not
the same level of involvement that there used to be. The package
has gotten to such a point where it is instantly useful to a very
large group of people. New development within XFree86 centers on
new drivers and support for future XC projects.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Let's
predict the future. Where is Linux going, and then, where do you
fit in to that future?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> To be commercially
viable, Linux needs applications. The CD manufacturers, to their
credit, are trying to make a &ldquo;shrink-wrapped&rdquo; version of Linux.
What they have done so far is good but there needs to be
more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>And what is
&ldquo;more&rdquo;?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> First, you need easy
answers to questions like &ldquo;can you run <span   class="emphasis"><em>blank</em></span>
under Linux&rdquo;. My sister, for example, runs some computer
applications that aren't available for Linux. She would also need a
nice graphical interface to system management; something as close
to &ldquo;load and go&rdquo; as possible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Okay, what
would your sister need available to make Linux a viable
choice?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Word processing, a
stat package and a database.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>The big one
missing here is a word processor. I don't think she wants vi and
troff.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Nope. And there are
quite a few people without the technical expertise to handle such
low-level software. They want to be productive&mdash;to solve their
problems. Linux can provide a much better platform than anything
else to develop these solutions, but the solutions themselves are
not quite there.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>How about a
package that had all these applications in them plus a phone
book.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> And a scheduling
package, and then you would have something that would meet the
needs of an average PC user. The basic question to answer is, &ldquo;Why
should I run Linux rather than another operating system?&rdquo; The apps
we design need to be something that's difficult, if not impossible,
to produce on any other platform available today. And note, the
competition is not standing still, either. Comparing today's plans
against today's commercial offerings means being instantly obsolete
once those plans are realized and the competition has had time to
catch up.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>What if we
add an Internet-access package? That would use the real
multi-tasking capabilities and included networking of
Linux.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> Yes, I think we are
on the right track.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Okay, where
do you fit into this future?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> I am working on some
packages like these. I am really interested in working on this but
I have a job which takes up quite a bit of my time. I know this is
a common problem.</p><p>Because of the delays of the Internet and the part-time
nature of people working over the Internet, I think this would need
to be done commercially rather than as a cooperative effort over
the net. Full-time, highly-focused development has obvious
advantages. That's where you can take the time to really put
together something nice&mdash;nice enough for my sister to use.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>If I won the
lottery and had money to burn, what do you think it would take to
make this whole package a reality?</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> A team of 10-20
people could make the package to end all packages we discussed
above happen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil:</b></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>I'll let you
know if I win the lottery. In the meantime, thanks for taking the
time for this interview.</em></span></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Orest:</b></span> You're welcome. I
enjoyed it.</p></div></div>
