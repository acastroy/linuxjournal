    In the May issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Eric explained how to set
    up and install CERN's World Wide Web server software. This
    month, he tells us how to use HTML to create hypertext
    documents for viewing by Web surfers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0xdb64a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a
simple language for representing document format styles and links
to other documents or media types, such as images or sound
recordings. HTML can be used to create documents which contain
styles such as underlined or bold-faced text. It can also be used
to mix text, images, and sounds into a single document, the
individual elements of which may be located on geographically
distant systems around the world.
</p><p>HTML is designed to create documents for the World Wide Web
and it helps determine what is displayed when you are browsing
documents with your favorite WWW browser. You can use it to create
your home, or welcome page or to create a research document,
article, or book. This document can then be viewed locally or made
accessible for viewing by other Web surfers through the use of a
WWW server, such as NCSA's or CERN's httpd daemon. This article
introduces you to HTML basics so you may get started creating your
own HTML documents.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0xdb6608"></a>Document Tags</h2></div></div><p>You can use your favorite text editor to create an HTML
document. The document will be composed of text, which will be
displayed directly to the user, and markup tags, which are used to
modify the appearance of the text or to incorporate images or
sounds as part of the document. Tags are also used when referencing
other documents or different locations within a document. Document
references are called <span   class="emphasis"><em>hypertext links</em></span> or
simply &ldquo;links&rdquo;.</p><p>A tag for indicating the start of a particular format is
represented as a tag name enclosed in a pair of angle brackets. To
indicate the termination of a format, the tag name is prefixed with
a <b  >/</b>. For instance,
<b  >&lt;I&gt;Italics&lt;/I&gt;</b> would display the
word &ldquo;Italics&rdquo; in italic format. Let's examine a simple HTML
document.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Sample Document&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;A Sample HTML Document&lt;/H1&gt;
Here is some &lt;B&gt;Bold text&lt;/B&gt;,
and here is some &lt;I&gt;Italic text&lt;/I&gt;.
&lt;/BODY&gt;
</pre><p>This makes use of a few basic tags. The text between the
<b  >&lt;HEAD&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;/HEAD&gt;</b> tags is the document header. The
header contains a <b  >&lt;TITLE&gt;</b> tag which
indicates the start of the document title tag and is terminated by
a <b  >&lt;/TITLE&gt;</b>. The title usually isn't
displayed as part of the document text by most browsers, but
instead is displayed in a special location. For instance, Mosaic
displays the title in the title box at the top of the browser
window.</p><p>After the header is the body of the document, which is
contained between the <b  >&lt;BODY&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;/BODY&gt;</b> tags. Inside the body the
<b  >&lt;H1&gt;</b> represents the start of a first level
document heading. There are six levels of headings. Each increase
in level results in a decrease in the prominence with which a
heading is displayed. For instance, you might want to use an
<b  >H1</b> heading for displaying the document title in
the document text, and then use <b  >H2</b> for
subheadings.</p><p>This is probably a good time to mention that tags are
case-insensitive. Thus <b  >&lt;TITLE&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;title&gt;</b> are the same tag; however, I will
continue to capitalize document tags for clarity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0xdb6d98"></a>Physical Format Style Tags</h2></div></div><p>Physical format styles are used to indicate the specific
physical appearance with which to display text. The following is a
list of physical format tags:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;B&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/B&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Displays <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> in bold face.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;I&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/I&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Displays <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> in italics.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;U&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/U&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Displays <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> underlined.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;TT&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/TT&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Displays <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> using a typewriter font.</p></dd></dl></div><p>The problem with physical formats is that there is no
guarantee that a particular browser will display the text as
expected. A user may modify the fonts that a browser uses, or the
browser may not even have the specified font style available. For
instance, if a text mode browser is used to display a document, it
is unlikely that italic text can be displayed at all. To avoid the
ambiguity associated with the display of physical formats, you may
use logical format tags. In fact, it is usually recommended that
you use logical format tags, in preference to physical format tags,
wherever you can.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0xdb7a50"></a>Logical Format Style Tags</h2></div></div><p>I've already introduced you to one logical format. The H1
through H6 heading styles are logical formats for headings. If
physical heading styles existed in HTML, you would have to specify
a particular font and font size for each heading (for example,
30-point Courier). Following is a list of some of the more common
logical format styles:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;CITE&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/CITE&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Used when <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> is the title of
a creative work such as a book.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;CODE&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/CODE&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Used when <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> is a piece of
computer code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;EM&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/EM&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Display <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> with
emphasis.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;SAMP&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/SAMP&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Used when <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> is a piece of
sample output.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;STRONG&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/STRONG&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Display <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span> with strong
emphasis.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Of particular note, it is better stylistic practice to use
the <b  >EM</b> logical style in place of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>italics</em></span> physical style, and to use the
<b  >STRONG</b> logical style in place of the
<span   class="bold"><b>bold</b></span> physical style.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x11b0d78"></a>Page Breaks, Rules, and Preformated Text</h2></div></div><p>Carriage returns and white space are usually ignored in HTML.
This is done because different browsers have different display
capabilities. Where one browser might be able to display 100
character lines, another might not. This presents a problem when it
is necessary to have a forced break, such as between paragraphs.
Special tags were created so that an author could force a break in
a document. Following is a list of tags which can be used to force
a break in a document:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;P&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Force a paragraph break.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;BR&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Force a line break.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><b  >&lt;HR&gt;</b></span></dt><dd><p>Force a line break with a horizontal rule.</p></dd></dl></div><p>As a general note, it is best to use break commands, as well
as other HTML directives in ways that keep your document device
independent. The browser your readers use might format documents
with different line lengths. If you use a <b  >BR</b>
directive at each line break found in a paper document you were
converting into HTML, a browser might insert additional line breaks
as well. This could result in a choppy-looking document, probably
with alternating long and short lines.</p><p>Notice that these break tags don't have an associated closing
tag. For instance the <b  >&lt;BR&gt;</b> doesn't have an
associated <b  >&lt;/BR&gt;</b>.</p><p>If you do want to display something exactly as it is typed,
HTML provides a tag for preserving the format of preformated text.
The
<b  >&lt;PRE&gt;</b><span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span><b  >&lt;/PRE&gt;</b>
directive instructs a browser to display <span   class="emphasis"><em>text</em></span>
exactly as it is typed in the document. Once again, keep in mind
that characteristics of some browsers may make it difficult for
them to display the text in the exact format you expect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x11b1770"></a>Lists and Definitions</h2></div></div><p>HTML provides for bulleted and numbered lists. Following is
an example of HTML code which will generate a bulleted or
unnumbered list of items:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Apples
&lt;LI&gt;Oranges
&lt;LI&gt;Pears
&lt;/UL&gt;
</pre><p>The <b  >&lt;UL&gt;</b> tag indicates the start of
an unnumbered list. Each item in the list is preceded by an
<b  >&lt;LI&gt;</b> tag to indicate the start of a new
item in the list. Note that the <b  >&lt;LI&gt;</b> tags
don't have closing tags, and that when displayed, each list item
will be separated by a carriage return.</p><p>To change this list to a numbered list, just change the
<b  >&lt;UL&gt;</b> and <b  >&lt;/UL&gt;</b>
tags into <b  >&lt;OL&gt;</b> and
<b  >&lt;/OL&gt;</b> tags. A numbered list will display
each item in the list preceded by a number instead of a
bullet.</p><p>Another type of list is a definition or description list.
Following is a snippet of HTML code demonstrating how to code a
definition list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Apple
&lt;DD&gt;A red colored fruit
&lt;DT&gt;Orange
&lt;DD&gt;An orange colored fruit
&lt;/DL&gt;
</pre><p>A <b  >&lt;DL&gt;</b> tag begins a definition list,
and a <b  >&lt;/DL&gt;</b> tag ends the list. The
<b  >&lt;DT&gt;</b> indicates a term to be defined, while
a <b  >&lt;DD&gt;</b> indicates a term definition. When
the browser formats the list, each term and definition will be on a
line by itself: the term is usually left justified with definition
indented directly beneath it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x11b1e50"></a>An Example Document</h2></div></div><p>Let's look at an example document which contains many of the
text markups which I just explained. The HTML source for the
example document is listed below, and the formatted document, as
displayed by Mosaic, as I have configured it, is shown in Figure 1,
below.</p><p><a href="1081f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1.</a></p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;TITLE&gt;Example Document 1&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Example Document 1&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;A Few Physical Styles&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;I&gt;This is in italics&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;B&gt;This in in Bold face&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;U&gt;This is underlined&lt;/U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;A Couple Logical Styles&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;EM&gt;This is text is displayed with
        emphasis&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;STRONG&gt;This text has strong emphasis&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;An Unnumbered List&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Apples can be red
&lt;LI&gt;Oranges can be orange
&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;A Definition List&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Term One
&lt;DD&gt;This is a short definition.
&lt;DT&gt;Term Two
&lt;DD&gt;This is a much longer definition, which
demonstrates what happens when a definition is
carried over to more than one line.
&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
</pre><p>Note a few interesting things about how the browser displayed
this document. Text marked up to be underlined is not displayed as
underlined. This demonstrates one of the dangers of physical
styles&mdash;some browsers may not support, or may not display a
physical style as expected. Also, note that italic text looks like
emphasized text and bold text looks like strong text. Notice the
use of BR and P break tags, and the display of a multiline
definition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x11b20b8"></a>URLs</h2></div></div><p>Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, are designed to provide a
standard format by which to point to a file. The file may exist on
any network-accessible machine the browser has access to, and files
may be accessed using a variety of protocols. The general form for
a URL is:
<b  ><i><tt>protocol</tt></i>:<i><tt>//host.domain</tt></i>[:<i><tt>port</tt></i>]<i><tt>/path/filename</tt></i></b></p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span> indicates how the browser
should communicate with the host it is requesting a file from.
Probably the most common protocols are <b  >http, file,
gopher</b>, and <b  >ftp</b>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>http</b></span> protocol indicates that the
browser should contact the server using the hypertext transport
protocol, which is used by servers designed to serve HTML
documents. The <span   class="bold"><b>file</b></span> protocol is
used to retrieve a file from a local directory. Many browsers also
support an <span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> protocol for
retrieving non-local files using anonymous ftp. The gopher protocol
is used to retrieve documents from a gopher server.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>host.domain</em></span> is the host and domain
name of the remote server to contact in order to retrieve a
document. If the document is on the local system, you can create a
partial URL that does not specify the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>host.domain</em></span>. To do this, you would omit the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>//host.domain</em></span> from the URL. Following the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>host.domain</em></span> is the optional (as indicated by
the &ldquo;[ ]&rdquo; characters, which should not be entered) port to connect
to in order to retrieve a document. This option is often omitted
since most remote services will be provided at a well-known port on
the remote system. For instance, the http protocol is commonly
found on port 80, while gopher is found on port 70. When omitting
the port, omit the &ldquo;:&rdquo; character as well.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>path</em></span> is used to indicate the
directory location of the desired document. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> specification indicates the name of
the file on the server where the document is stored.</p><p>As an example, if you wanted to view the document foo.html,
which you know is located in directory /docs/ on the server
remote.host.name, you could use the URL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://remote.host.name/docs/foo.html
</pre><p>Your browser would then display the foo.html document. It is
worth noting that many browsers will use the file extension to help
determine how to display a document. For instance, .html is
commonly used for html documents and .text is used for text
documents. For this reason, it is usually a good idea to append a
standard extension to your documents to help ensure that they will
be displayed properly. You may want to refer to the documentation
on your browser to determine what file extensions are supported,
although many browsers are now referring to the mailcap file to
help determine the interpretation of a particular extension.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x10c32b8"></a>References</h2></div></div><p>Why do we care about URLs? URLs are used to make references
to image, sound and other media files that you may want to include
or have a hypertext link to. URLs are also used to create links to
other documents. Let's look at an example of how to include an
inline image in a document.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;IMG SRC="http://remote.host.name/gifs/foo.gif"&gt;
</pre><p>The <b  >IMG</b> tag has an attribute, a
specification which indicates a particular characteristic about a
tag. In this case, the SRC attribute indicates the image the tag
refers to. Assuming that your browser is capable of displaying
inline GIFs, foo.gif would be displayed along with the text of the
document containing the <b  >IMG</b> reference. Remember
to use proper file extensions for image references. A browser will
use the extension to determine how to properly display an image.
For instance, <b  >.gif</b> is used for GIF images while
<b  >.xbm</b> is used for X bitmaps.</p><p>To create a hypertext link to another HTML document you might
use the following HTML directive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;A HREF="http://remote.host.name/docs/foo.html"&gt;Foodocument&lt;/A&gt;
</pre><p>This is an example of an <span   class="emphasis"><em>anchor</em></span>. An
anchor is specified using an <b  >A</b> tag, which
typically has an <b  >HREF</b> attribute. Unlike the
<b  >IMG</b> tag, an anchor has to be terminated with a
<b  >&lt;/A&gt;</b>. In this example, &ldquo;Foo document&rdquo; will
be displayed in the documents as a hypertext link, or anchor, to
foo.html. Many browsers will display this anchor using colored text
or some other indication that the text represents a link. When the
reader selects such an anchor, the browser will attempt to retrieve
the document specified by the <b  >HREF</b>
attribute.</p><p>Hypertext links may also point to images which are viewed
using an external viewer or to sounds which are played when the
link is selected. An image can be used as a link instead of using
text. The following code demonstrates how to do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;A HREF="http://remote.host.name/docs/foo.html"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://remote.host.name/gifs/foo.gif"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</pre><p>In this example an <b  >IMG</b> tag is used as the
anchor for foo.html. This effectively makes the inline foo.gif an
anchor a user selects. Anchors which are images present another
problem. How is a text mode browser going to present an image, and
if it can't present the image, how is a user going to select the
link? Fortunately, HTML provides an additional attribute for the
<b  >IMG</b> tag. The <b  >ALT</b> attribute
can be used to specify a text string as an alternate to displaying
the image. This can be done as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;IMG SRC="http://remote.host.name/gifs/foo.gif" ALT="FOO"&gt;
</pre><p>The ALT attribute is also useful to provide a method a text
browser can use to display an inline logo, or some other image that
isn't necessarily a hypertext link.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x10c3ba8"></a>A Second Example Document</h2></div></div><p>Now let's look at a second example document which contains
inline images and anchors. The HTML source for the second example
document is presented below. <a href="1081f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure
2</a> shows how Mosaic might display this document.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;TITLE&gt;Example Document 2&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;The Second Example Document&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://remote.host.name/gifs/foo.gif"&gt; An inline image
&lt;HR&gt;
 This is an &lt;A HREF="http://remote.host.name/docs/foo.html"&gt;
anchor&lt;/A&gt; to the foo.html document.
&lt;HR&gt;
&lt;A HREF="http://remote.host.name/docs/foo.html"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="http://remote.host.name/gifs/foo.gif" ALT="FOO!!!"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
This image is also an anchor to the foo.html
document.
&lt;/BODY&gt;
</pre><p>Notice how the anchor, <span   class="emphasis"><em>anchor</em></span>, is
embedded in the text of the document, as are the inline images.
Further, the document text is aligned at the bottom of the image.
This can be changed by using the <b  >ALIGN</b> attribute
of the <b  >IMG</b> tag. Here is an example which aligns
the text with the center of the image:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="http://remote.host.name/gifs/foo.gif"&gt;
</pre><p><b  >top</b> and <b  >bottom</b> are also
valid options for the <b  >ALIGN</b> attribute.</p><p><a href="1081s1.html" target="_self">Online HTML References</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbe580.0x10c4128"></a>Further Things To Explore</h2></div></div><p>This article is only designed to give you an introduction to
