Build a secure file server with cross-platform compatibility.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27d4580.0x28cc460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I began a multipart series of articles on how to build a
secure file server based on Samba for local (non-Internet-facing) use. I
gave an overview of file server security goals, described why Samba might
be the best tool for the particular job of serving &ldquo;network
drives&rdquo; to
clients on different platforms connected to a Local Area Network, defined
a number of Samba acronyms and concepts, and explained how to install the
Samba server d&aelig;mons, client utilities and its configuration GUI, Swat.
</p><p>
This month, I expand upon our usage scenario and begin
demonstrating how to construct an smb.conf file that executes this
scenario in a secure fashion. As usual, I cover not only
security, but also how to get things working in general&mdash;it isn't helpful
to be told how to secure a process that isn't behaving the way you expect
in the first place.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27d4580.0x28cc6c8"></a>
Usage Scenario</h2></div></div><p>
As I explained last month, we want to build a convenient and secure file server that supports both Windows and Linux (and other
*nix) clients. Specifically, we want to build a non-Internet-facing
Samba file service that supports several different levels of security:
Guest (anonymous) access, read-only access for some authorized users
and read/write access for other authorized users.
</p><p>
To use more Samba-specific terms, our server will operate with
&ldquo;user-mode&rdquo; security, using a combination of local Linux/UNIX user account
information and Samba-specific hashes of those users' passwords to
authenticate access to workgroup resources. A workgroup, you may remember
from last month, may include shares provided by multiple Samba servers,
but each server in that workgroup must maintain its own
user database independently (which is why Domains and Active Directories are better
choices than workgroups for more complex environments). Accordingly,
our sample workgroup will use a single server.
</p><p>
To flesh out our example scenario still further, let's suppose I've got a
boardinghouse and my tenants are a trio of FBI special agents: Skippy,
Knute and Pepe. Being fond of my cooking, they keep a close watch on my
weekly meal schedule, which I post on my Samba server every Sunday
night&mdash;you can bet nobody works late any evening on which tater tots will
be served. This schedule is a public document, as far as I'm concerned
(I'm vain about my cooking).
</p><p>
If my resident agents help mow the grass, feed the hedgehogs and tune
the piano, they get a break on rent. So, I also maintain a schedule of
chores they all can read, but which, of course, I don't want them to
be able to change themselves (imagine the outrage if Pepe always got to
feed the hedgehogs).
</p><p>
Besides, being secret agents after all, these guys don't want anyone else to know
who'll be outside raking the compost on any given Saturday&mdash;you never
know when the enemies of freedom might strike. So, the chore schedule
is private, and it can be read but not altered by my tenants.
</p><p>
Finally, unbeknownst to the boys, their boss has asked me to log their
Web-surfing activity from my firewall. Although the joke's on him (they all
use TOR), these logs are nonetheless super-secret. Actually,
those logs probably don't belong on any file server at all, but
sometimes I amuse myself by adding fake entries to Skippy's log (&ldquo;GET
HTTP://thesharperimage.com/expensive_gifts_for_your_boss.html&rdquo;), so my
firewall stores them on a restricted share on the Samba server.
</p><p>
To summarize, I need to create a workgroup (I'll call it FED-CENTRAL)
with four user accounts (skippy, knute, pepe and mick) and three
file shares (SUPPER, CHORES and BUZZ-OFF).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27d4580.0x28ccae8"></a>
Samba Configuration: Global Settings</h2></div></div><p>
With that, we are ready to go. Assuming you successfully installed
the Samba server and client packages per last month's instructions,
the first step in configuring Samba is to set some global variables.
</p><p>
There are two different ways to configure Samba. The first is by editing
/etc/samba/smb.conf directly using your text editor of choice, and then
restarting the smbd and nmbd Samba d&aelig;mons. You very well may gravitate
to this method as soon as you're comfortable with Samba, because it's
the quickest and most direct way to change Samba's behavior.
</p><p>
Lately, I've become a big fan of the second way, however: Swat, the
Samba Web Administration Tool. If you're scandalized by my endorsing a
graphical tool that requires you to set a root password (which, by default,
doesn't exist on Ubuntu systems), see last month's column. Suffice it to
say that in this case, I'm not talking about an Internet-facing system,
and the educational benefits of Swat outweigh its security risks here.
</p><p>
Besides, Swat really isn't a crutch; it simply presents you with a Web
form for assigning values to all possible variables in smb.conf, with
convenient Help buttons that send you directly to the appropriate
section of the relevant man page. The more you use Swat, the more
comfortable you'll be editing smb.conf directly. How many GUIs can you
say <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> about?
</p><p>
I'm going to assume you had no problems with the instructions I provided
last month on installing Samba and Swat, including configuring and
restarting inetd, and that Ubuntu users were able to stomach issuing
the <tt  >sudo passwd root</tt> to set a root password. (And, even if you weren't,
or simply prefer not to use Swat, all of what follows still should be
useful, because the variables and values in my Swat screenshots and examples
are the same as those contained in smb.conf.)
</p><p>
Running Swat is easy. Simply start your browser of choice, and point it to
http://localhost:901/. The first thing you'll see is Swat's Home page,
which consists of a row of navigation buttons (Home, Globals, Shares,
Printers and so forth). These appear on every one of Swat's screens,
but unique to the Home page is a list of links to local man pages, HOWTOs
and even complete books. I leave it to you to explore those; this page
leads to a wealth of useful information for Samba users at all levels
of skill and experience.
</p><p>
For now, however, let's dive right into Samba's global
settings. If you click the Globals button, and then scroll down to
where the actual settings begin, you should see something like Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10256f1.large.jpg"><img src="10256f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Some Global Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Obviously, we want to change the value of workgroup from WORKGROUP to
FED-CENTRAL. The default for netbios name, however, is the hostname
Samba automatically read in from /etc/hostname, and you usually can leave
that alone, although you don't have to. This is the name that turns up in
people's &ldquo;network neighborhood&rdquo; browser when they look for your server.
</p><p>
The default value for security, which is user, also is exactly what
we want. The same is true of encrypt passwords being marked yes.
</p><p>
The next two variables, however, client schannel and server schannel,
need to be changed. Schannel refers to the secure channel method of
allowing Samba clients to log on to Samba servers, and we don't want
this to be optional. We want it to be mandatory. Therefore, for both
of those variables, we should change the value from auto to yes.
</p><p>
The last variable shown in Figure 1 is map to guest. That value 
tells Samba under what circumstances it should grant guest access to a client
that has just had a failed login attempt. Samba's default for this is
normally never, which effectively disables guest access. But, as you
can see in Figure 1, on my Ubuntu system, the default value actually
is Bad User, which means that if people try to log on with a nonexistent
user name, they'll be given guest access.
</p><p>
If you scroll farther down on Samba's Global page, you should see
something like Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10256f2.large.jpg"><img src="10256f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. More Global Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Continuing through these global settings, obey pam restrictions
implies that Samba will honor PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
settings. But in practice, if encrypt passwords remains set to yes,
Samba will ignore PAM altogether.
</p><p>
passdb backend specifies what type of database Samba should use to store
its password hashes. The default (tbdsam) is usually the best choice.
</p><p>
guest account is the local Linux account that will be used for clients
who fail authentication, as I described earlier when talking about map
to guest. passwd program, passwd chat and unix password sync
involve how and whether Samba mediates end users' attempts to change
their passwords via Samba (Windows file sharing) sessions. Leave these
at the default settings unless you don't want users to be able to change
their passwords that way.
</p><p>
By now, you may be wondering, what's the difference between Samba's
password database and the list of hashes stored in /etc/shadow, given the
fact that they correspond to the same set of local user accounts? The
short answer is, Samba (SMB/CIFS) uses an authentication protocol with
which UNIX password hashes are not compatible.
</p><p>
The bad news is that Samba's password database is, thus, totally redundant
with Linux's, and it creates the potential for users having to remember
two different passwords. The good news is that if passwd program and
passwd chat are set correctly (which they should be by default, if
you use your Linux distribution's official Samba packages), and unix
password sync is set to yes, Samba automatically will update 
users' Linux passwords every time they change their Samba password. 
(I talk about this more in the next section.)
</p><p>
Moving on, valid users allows you to specify a list of Linux/UNIX user
accounts to which you want to grant access to Samba shares. The default
value "" (null) results in all local Linux accounts being valid. For
our example scenario, I've set valid users to mick, knute, pepe,
skippy and nobody.
</p><p>
admin users allows you to grant superuser privileges on all shares
for one or more local user accounts, regardless of Samba or Linux file
permissions on that share. Be careful with this setting! It has the
effect of executing local commands as root on behalf of such users. In
Figure 2, I've specified mick as an admin user, because I often use
that account for system administration tasks anyhow.
</p><p>
read list allows you to specify which users should have default read-only permissions on shares. As you can see in Figure 2, I've set our
read list to knute, pepe and skippy.
</p><p>
Similarly, write list specifies a list of users who should have
read-write privileges by default. I've set that value to mick.
</p><p>
printer admin is out of the scope of this article for now (though I may cover printer
shares later in this series). hosts allow and hosts deny, however,
are noteworthy. They allow you to create TCP Wrappers-style access control
lists. hosts allow is a whitelist of IP addresses, network addresses,
hostnames or domain names that should be allowed to connect by default
(assuming successful authentication, of course).
</p><p>
hosts deny is a blacklist, also consisting of IP addresses, network
addresses and so forth, whose members won't even be permitted to attempt
authentication. Samba will break any connection attempted by any host
matching this list. The hosts_access(5) man page provides complete
information about the syntax of the values of these two variables.
</p><p>
And, that's it for global settings, for now. To write the changes we've
made to our working /etc/samba/samba.conf file, click Swat's Commit
Changes button.
</p><p>
Some of the variables you set to custom strings, such as valid users,
may not appear when the screen refreshes. To see them, simply click
the Advanced View button (next to Change View To: near the top of
the page).

Setting Up User Accounts</h2></div></div><p>
The last task we've got space for this month is setting up our user
accounts, and there are four steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create the accounts under Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
Assign those accounts Linux passwords.
</p></li><li><p>
Create Samba password database entries for each.
</p></li><li><p>
Have the users change their Samba passwords.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Step one is to use whatever method you usually use to create user accounts
on your system&mdash;either by using your system administration GUI of choice
(such as GNOME's Users and Groups applet) or via the commands useradd,
userdel and so forth.
</p><p>
For example, to create Pepe's account, I could use the following command. Note
the <tt  >sudo</tt>, necessary for Ubuntu. On other
distributions, <tt  >su</tt> to root
before executing these commands, and omit the sudo that each begins with
here:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo useradd -c "Pepe" -m -g users pepe
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates the user account pepe with the comment Pepe,
automatically creates a home directory (/home/pepe) and assigns it to
the group users. To be extra paranoid, you could insert the string
<tt  >-s
/bin/false</tt> after <tt  >-g users</tt>, which will disable normal Linux logins for
Pepe's account, making it useless for anything other than Samba access.
</p><p>
Step two is to set each user's Linux password, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo passwd pepe
</pre>
</p><p>
Obviously, you need to communicate whatever password you set here to
Pepe in a secure fashion, and Pepe will need to change this password to
something you don't know. (But that part happens in step four.)
</p><p>
Step three is to use the smbpasswd command to create each user's Samba
password database entry, like so:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ sudo smbpasswd -a pepe
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll be prompted to set and confirm Pepe's Samba password, after which
the new account will be added. It's probably a good idea to use the same
initial password here that you used in step two.
</p><p>
Finally, you'll want Pepe to log in to the system (assuming you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>didn't</em></span> set his shell to /bin/false) and issue the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pepe@casademick$ smbpasswd
</pre>
</p><p>
Pepe will be prompted for his old password, his new password and
confirmation of his new password. Assuming all three of those are good,
Samba will change both Pepe's Samba password and his Linux password
accordingly. Note that this synchronization does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> occur when
you create a new Samba password entry as root, using the -a flag.
</p><p>
If Pepe has an invalid shell, such as /bin/false, you'll have to let him
sit at your console while you type the command <tt  >sudo smbpasswd
pepe</tt>,
and then turn your back while he changes his password. You'll then need
to do the same thing with the command <tt  >sudo passwd
pepe</tt>, because Samba does
not synchronize Linux/UNIX passwords if you execute smbpasswd as root.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27d4580.0x2cc6700"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Regenerating smb.conf in Debian/Ubuntu</b></p><p>
What if, in the process of tinkering with your Samba configuration, you
so completely lose track of what you've changed versus what you started
with that you want to begin again with the default /etc/samba/smb.conf
file? And, what if you failed to create a backup copy of smb.conf before
you changed it?
</p><p>
You might think Swat could do this. Swat has default buttons next
to each configuration option. Clicking a default button is supposed
to replace your custom value with the value from the default smb.conf
file included with Samba. However, in my own experience, the behavior
of these buttons is erratic. Sometimes null values are (incorrectly)
returned, and clicking the default button for every option is
time consuming anyhow.
</p><p>
My advice is that if you're using Debian or one of its derivatives,
such as Ubuntu, and you need a fresh smb.conf file, you should completely
un-install the package samba-common, and then re-install it. (This
also will result in things that depend on samba-common to be un-installed,
so
note which packages you'll need to re-install after you've
restored samba-common.)
</p><p>
In between removing and re-installing samba-common, you may want to check
/etc/samba to make sure smb.conf is truly gone, and delete it if it isn't.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We've specified our usage scenario, set up some basic global settings
using Swat and started adding users. Next month, we'll create the actual
shares, but if you can't wait until then, you'll have no problem figuring
out how using Swat's ample documentation. The &ldquo;Official Samba 3.2.x
HOWTO and Reference Guide&rdquo; (see Resources)
also may help. Have fun, and be safe!
