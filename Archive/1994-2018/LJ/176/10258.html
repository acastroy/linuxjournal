What are the most significant
trends in the world of Linux-based devices?</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Henry Kingman:</b></span> Some trends in the world of Linux may be:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Using desktop and server software instead of special
&ldquo;embedded&rdquo; software
(Nokia started this trend).
</p></li><li><p>
Using Linux in place of an RTOS (real-time OS).
</p></li><li><p>
Better &ldquo;free&rdquo; sources of Linux, such as the kernels, BSPs and
filesystems supplied by chip or board suppliers and open-source projects.
</p></li><li><p>
More commercial support options, with hybrid service/product companies like
Embedded Alley making headway.
</p></li><li><p>
Better tools, with the industry aligning behind Eclipse and its top-level
Device Software Development Platform.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Trends <span   class="emphasis"><em>caused</em></span> by Linux may include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Ridiculous feature proliferation, such as multiple radios in mobile
devices, car stereos that can park the car, vending machines that phone in
orders and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Ubiquitous networking.
</p></li><li><p>
Ubiquitous Web control interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Near-ubiquitous media rendering and GPS.
</p></li><li><p>
Richer interfaces across the board.
</p></li><li><p>
Ever-shorter product life cycles.
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Rick Lehrbaum:</b></span> First, Linux is really well established. It's become the
default choice for devices with 32-bit processors&mdash;that is, developers tend
to start with the assumption that they'll use Linux and use something
else only if they require special capabilities, or if the
&ldquo;politics&rdquo; of
their company are strongly stacked in favor of an RTOS or Windows CE/XPe.
</p><p>
Second, Linux has become the default OS for several device categories,
including the emerging MID, Netbook and Nettop product categories;
traditional thin-client terminals; Wi-Fi routers; set-top boxes, such as
TiVo and the Roku Netflix box; and very significantly, mid- and high-end
mobile phones. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Shawn Powers:</b></span> I think largely the idea that Linux is no longer a
buzzword, but rather the norm, is very significant. It's almost unsettling
that so many devices are incorporating Linux, and yet that isn't as unique
and exciting as it used to be from a marketing standpoint. Back in August
at LinuxWorld, I noticed a huge trend in that so much of the conference
<span   class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> Linux, but wasn't really
<span   class="emphasis"><em>about</em></span> Linux. It's as if we've finally
taken over the world, and it's not as exciting as we thought it would be.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill Weinberg:</b></span> Linux is becoming
increasingly ubiquitous as an embedded
software platform. From data gleaned from analyst reports and from my own
direct contact with OEMs, about one-third of 32- and 64-bit designs are
using Linux. Application areas include mobile telephony, consumer
electronics, automotive systems/GPS, telecommunications and networking
infrastructure, even medical and aerospace/defense.
</p><p>
Trends that I see include consolidation of systems/software
platforms&mdash;mobile in particular.
The visible manifestations of the trend toward consolidation include the
merger of dot-orgs like LiPS and LiMo; companies like ACCESS, Azingo,
Purple Labs and others joining LiMo and embracing that platform spec; Intel
embracing Ubuntu/Canonical as part of Moblin and also buying OpenHand; Wind
River buying Mizi Research; and Sun refocusing the role of Linux-based
JavaFX Mobile to complement Google/Android.
</p><p>
Frankly, more important (in my humble opinion) than &ldquo;.organic&rdquo; mergers and
activities is ORGANIC consolidation. In particular, if you look at the
range of FOSS and commercial mobile platforms (including those mentioned
above), you will see a consolidation of foundation components around:
the Linux kernel 2.6, glibc, GTK+/Cairo/Pango, WebKit, GStreamer and Java
(still a must for legacy interoperability).
This development is illustrated in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10258f1.large.jpg"><img src="10258f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Consolidation (Copyright LinuxPundit 2008)
</p></div></div><p>
The second major trend is
that the upward motion of the value line put OEMs in the pilot
seat.
OEMs and integrators have a better range of choices with regard to buying
and/or building a Linux-based embedded platform and toolkit. They can
certainly turn to OSVs, like MontaVista and Wind River, and/or smaller
packaged product/services companies. They also can purchase
application-purposed vertical stacks for mobile, automotive, MIDs and so on
from companies like those mentioned above. They also can, with more
confidence than ever before, self-integrate bits directly from OSS projects with
their value-added internal code and ISVware. And, they can mix and match.
This development is illustrated in Figure 2.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a60580.0x2f52548"></a>Are you optimistic for the future of
Linux-based devices?</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kingman:</b></span> Yes. If they are running Linux, they won't crash, and the battery
will last a long time.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Lehrbaum:</b></span> Yes, very much so. Silicon vendors now favor Linux as the
number-one platform to get their new device-oriented processors, chipsets
and peripheral controllers up and running on, so Linux support gets a
strong head start and is generally promoted by chip makers.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Powers:</b></span> Oh, without a doubt. In fact, although I was joking a bit
regarding &ldquo;taking over the world&rdquo;&mdash;I think Linux will continue to
spread into the embedded market. It just makes sense. Also, with projects
like Moblin and its ilk, embedded Linux on devices is looking really
snazzy.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Weinberg:</b></span> I remain very bullish on Linux as embedded systems software,
notwithstanding announcements from Nokia, Symbian and others (see my blog,
address in the Resources for this article) and advances by Microsoft. These and other moves/gestures
toward openness and FOSS &ldquo;scratch the itch&rdquo; for access to source code as
documentation and for source escrow, but they don't offer the unique
combination of community-driven development, scalability, performance and
real self-determination that you get with Linux and accompanying FOSS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a60580.0x2f52968"></a>
Do you consider any particular devices from the past year or
so to be game-changers for the success of Linux? If so, why?</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kingman:</b></span> The Wind River Linux Platform for
Infotainment, for showing Linux
could crack the automotive OEM equipment market; Motorola's Rokr Z6, for
showing that a Linux phone could ship in volume in the US; the Netflix
Player, for showing how inexpensive and powerful Linux multimedia devices
can be; the myriad Orion-based NAS devices, for making NAS affordable to
home users; and low-cost, power-efficient Nettop and Netbook devices, such
as the Eee PC, for bringing desktop Linux to the masses.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Lehrbaum:</b></span> I really like the Netflix movie-streaming set-top-box
(manufactured by Roku). Linux has long been a winner in TV set-top boxes
(think TiVo), and it's an area of exploding interest, given the growing
ubiquity of broadband and drive toward streaming content to everyone's home
theaters.
</p><p>
Automotive infotainment systems&mdash;featuring GPS, traffic updates, Internet
access, streaming media, VoIP and so on&mdash;is another area set to
explode.
</p><p>
There also are two+ major emerging device categories that both typically
either come standard Linux or offering Linux as a full-fledged alternative to
Windows: MIDs (mobile Internet devices), Netbooks and Nettops. All these
terms were coined by Intel. MIDs strongly favor Linux due to being more
appliance-like with built-in applications and not a lot of capability for
normal users to alter the application set. Netbooks, typified by the Eee
PC, have fully functional OSes, albeit stripped to fit in limited resources
(often Flash, though HDDs sometimes are available as an option). They are
generally available with Linux-only offered for the least expensive models
and a choice of Linux or Windows XP Pro for the higher-end models (which
have more RAM and storage Flash or HDD). A variant of the Netbook is the
Nettop, having similar computing resources (including chipsets) but 
packaged in a mini PC-style box rather than the mini laptop-style formats
of Netbooks.
</p><p>
The [articles on Netbooks by Lehrbaum, linked to in the Resources section]
project the Netbook market will reach 50
million units by 2012, up from about 5 million this year. Obviously, given
Linux as a baseline OS in the low-end models, this could be good news for
Linux. However, as costs come down and RAM/Flash becomes higher density, the
barriers to using Windows (depending on Microsoft's price positioning)
could make Windows affordable. But clearly, the lower the end-user pricing
of a Netbook, the less likely it is going to be able to afford a full-function MS
OS like Windows XP or Vista.
</p><p>
So there is exciting potential here for Linux. Furthermore, bearing in mind
that the whole idea of Netbook is the Net&mdash;that is, Web-based applications
are central to its functioning. Thus, a Netbook is a bit like an
Internet-connected thin client, and Linux does very well in such scenarios.
Consequently, Netbooks should be considered a very high-priority target for
Linux, just as mid- to high-end mobile phones are an important battleground
for embedded Linux.
</p><p>
And, just as Netbooks are a fertile field for Linux, the same is true with
Nettops&mdash;devices in which much of the heavy-lifting apps
are Internet-based, and the device itself mainly needs a browser, e-mail
client (not even required), media players and other basic functions, but
are not expected to be true PCs that run every app you might want to try to
load from a DVD.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Powers:</b></span> Yes, indeed. The Eee PC began a trend that not only caught on like
wildfire, but also significantly displayed Linux as a viable operating
system for standard computer usage. We're just beginning to see how the
Linux Netbook idea will change computing. The Netbooks are smaller than
standard computers (or even notebooks), so they have a lot in common with
handheld devices, and yet they are fully functional, so they demonstrate some of the
same characteristics as a standard desktop solution. I think Netbooks
might bridge the gap and open the door for vendors to take another look at
pre-installing Linux on OEM hardware&mdash;even on the big desktop machines.
That's my hope anyway.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Weinberg:</b></span> Embedded Linux is already incredibly ubiquitous in intelligent
devices. The real question is &ldquo;What would change the game?&rdquo; I
think there are two vectors that could boost embedded Linux positioning:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Truly open mass-market devices running Linux plus enabling middleware that
would engender and excite both ISVs and a targeted developer community.
</p></li><li><p>
Highly differentiated devices where Linux at the core would make a real
impression on end users and build brand equity.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I haven't seen either of those situations emerge yet, but then again, other
embedded platforms don't enjoy either scenario. Most RTOSes are
100% invisible to end users (except when they fail). Even Windows Mobile
does not enjoy ubiquitous end-user pull, nor much popularity among
developers, even if in some markets it's the only game in town.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a60580.0x2f53150"></a>
What limitations or barriers need to be overcome for world
domination by Linux in the devices space?</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kingman:</b></span> Well, Linux has been the dominant device OS since 2003 or 2004,
according to the market research I see. For it to continue, I see three
hurdles to clear:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Each vertical market may ultimately need to fight fragmentation by
forming an industry group and/or support existing standardization efforts,
like CELF, LiMo, the LF and so on. That way, the &ldquo;value line&rdquo; separating
what you get for free vs. where you start differentiating your product can
continue to rise, which in turn will attract new adopters. Linux is a
collaboration, and I suspect that the better we work together, the bigger
it will get.
</p></li><li><p>
Within the limitations of the fast product development cycles embedded
Linux developers have to deal with, it would be great if more of them would
get involved in Linux kernel development. By &ldquo;active role&rdquo;, I mean tracking
current kernel versions when feasible during development and submitting
patches to the LKML. This saves Linux from being wholly shaped by
enterprise server companies, but it also makes things easier when the time
comes to port your stack forward to a new kernel version (if you ever plan
to do that), especially if your patches are accepted.
</p></li><li><p>
It would be great if things continue to get easier, financially, for the
commercial embedded Linux OS and tool providers like MontaVista, Wind
River and others. These companies contribute quite a bit to open-source
projects, like Linux and Eclipse, as well as to standards bodies and
industry groups, helping to ensure that embedded interests are
well represented in key projects.
</p></li></ol></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Lehrbaum:</b></span> One area of concern is the lack of a truly dominant,
mainstream,
free graphical application toolkit for device applications based on Linux.
Qt is popular, but there are licensing and royalty requirements for
commercial device applications. This could result in design wins for
Windows CE, which is offered at a fairly low royalty rate to OEMs, and
which has excellent and inexpensive development tools.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Powers:</b></span> If you look at the number of Linux-based devices in the
market now&mdash;not a whole lot needs to be done. I think perhaps we need to market
&ldquo;Linux Inside&rdquo; stickers, so people actually know there's a penguin under
the hood.
</p><p>
If you look slightly outside the gadget or device arena, however, there
are a few hurdles that are still sizable. I have a friend who works for
Honeywell, designing hardware-testing solutions. Much of the firmware and
software he develops for the hardware is still in MS-DOS. Many vendors are
still embedding with DOS and providing only DOS drivers for their hardware.
Since he's a friend, I've been hounding him for years to start switching
over to Linux instead of building layers of DOS on top of Windows
solutions, but in the end, he's held hostage by hardware vendors not opening up
their specs enough to allow a programmer any access outside their
proprietary DOS or Windows drivers. Because much of what he builds is
mission-critical (and often could endanger lives), reverse-engineering isn't
something he feels confident doing. It's very frustrating.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Weinberg:</b></span> In real-world terms, &ldquo;world domination&rdquo;
and 30%+ market share are
almost synonymous. However, some ongoing barriers to adoption include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The refusal by the kernel developer community to stabilize kernel APIs
and driver architecture to help OEMs and OSVs &ldquo;future-proof&rdquo;
device drivers. The mismatch between the practices of this important
community and actual industry practices is a gap that neither side is ready
to bridge.
</p></li><li><p>
The hazy definition of &ldquo;embedded Linux&rdquo; and &ldquo;mobile
Linux&rdquo; that is
presented to ISVs and other developers not currently familiar with Linux.
Although Windows/CE/Mobile, Symbian and Java are actually rather fragmented of
their own accords, they at least provide the appearance of unified APIs and
SDKs. The situation for Linux is improving. See the emerging
quasi-standardized APIs from LiMo, OHA and others.
</p></li><li><p>
The insistence of many embedded industry players, advocates and opponents
of embedded Linux alike, in perpetuating concerns about GPL and other OSS
licensing terms. Reciprocity need not be equated with
&ldquo;infection&rdquo; and
&ldquo;contamination&rdquo;.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a60580.0x2f53d00"></a>
Are there any &ldquo;dud&rdquo; devices out there that don't live up to
their promise in your view?</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kingman:</b></span> Any Linux device released without source code or a promise to
provide it is a dud in my book. There tends to be more GPL license
violations in the device world, I guess because people think that no one
will notice or want to modify software that's &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; inside a device.
But, it's pretty obvious which devices out there run Linux. Usually, you
can tell from a glance at the spec sheet&mdash;let alone any of the more-technical telltale fingerprints.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Lehrbaum:</b></span> The Nokia 770. I've had one since it came out and have updated to
the latest released OS for it, but I have to say that its capabilities are
quite disappointing&mdash;particularly in comparison to how well Apple's
iPhone performs on a small touchscreen.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Powers:</b></span> Well, my Eee PC's tiny keyboard annoys me, but my fat fingers
shouldn't count as a strike against ASUS. If there's a potential dud, it
would be with the saturation of Netbook solutions from multiple
vendors, and multiple revisions from the same vendors. I'm not sure
whether
that means it's a dud or just the natural progression of a viral product
idea, but I do worry that it will start to veer people away from the tiny
Notebook concept.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Weinberg:</b></span> It's best to reference the reviews on LinuxDevices.com. The biggest
dud concept, however, is that Linux-based phones confer almost none of the
virtues to those devices that the OS does to other devices.

nice, clean UI.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Powers:</b></span> Although I've never touched one, the Nokia devices look like
awesome little handheld devices. The ASUS Eee PC 701 was very significant,
and even if just by merit of originality, it's one of my favorites. I like
the OpenMoko FreeRunner, and although it's not ready for prime time yet, I
think it might be a huge boon to Linux-based cellular phones. Add in the
adorable Tux Droid, and I think you have a handful of really nifty Linux

Roku's Netflix Player (<a href="http://www.roku.com/products/netflixplayer" target="_self">www.roku.com/products/netflixplayer</a>)</b></p><p>
&ldquo;Instant movie gratification&rdquo; coos Henry Kingman of Roku's
Linux-driven Netflix Player, a networked video device that delivers Netflix
streaming content directly to your television. It provides access to a
library of more than 12,000 on-demand titles from Netflix. The Netflix Player
is HD-ready and has all the connections you need to connect to a TV, HDTV,
home theatre or A/V receiver, including HDMI. The device includes Ethernet
and Wi-Fi (802.11b/g), allowing one to play, pause, fast-forward and rewind
movies directly from the Internet over a home network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10258f3.large.jpg"><img src="10258f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Roku Netflix
</p></div></div><p>
Roku has used Linux on the Netflix Player has since its inception.
Roku's David Westerhoff, Director of Software Engineering, says his
company chose Linux because it has &ldquo;come a long way&rdquo; and allows it to
&ldquo;focus on developing [its] application and helps keep the costs
down&rdquo;. Westerhoff adds that having the source code gives his team the
flexibility to &ldquo;go deep if necessary to debug, troubleshoot and
optimize our software for the best user experience&rdquo;. During product
development, Roku developers found and fixed about a half-dozen distinct
bugs in the build toolchain, plus some driver-specific bugs. However, the
2.6.19.1 Linux kernel has been very stable and required no modifications to
the product.
</p><p>
The device uses the MIPS-based PNX8935 SoC from NXP Semiconductors for
application and video processing. The application is written primarily in
C++ and runs a Linux 2.6.19.1 kernel. Roku uses DirectFB to provide an
abstraction layer for the graphics and video services on the platform and
Qt 4.3 to provide a framework for UI development. The device has no hard
disk, just 256MB of DDR RAM to provide the memory needed for its
applications, plus the buffering necessary to support streaming video
playback.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Robust video streaming over home networks takes a significant amount
of effort to get right&rdquo;, adds Westerhoff. Therefore, the Player uses
dynamic bandwidth detection to select the best possible stream for the
user's network and then monitors it continuously during playback to
provide the best user experience possible. If the available bandwidth
changes, the device responds by selecting a new stream at a bitrate
appropriate for the situation.

Wind River Linux Platform for Infotainment (<a href="http://www.windriver.com" target="_self">www.windriver.com</a>)
</b></p><p>
Although the Wind River Linux Platform for Infotainment (WRLPI) will remain
in development until late 2009, our experts see it as a watershed
development for the Linux device space. Wind River calls the platform an
&ldquo;automotive-optimized commercial Linux&rdquo; for applications for the
in-vehicle infotainment segment of the automotive industry. John Bruggeman,
Wind River's Chief Marketing Officer, spoke of a &ldquo;pure open-source
strategy&rdquo;&mdash;that is, not just a distribution but a &ldquo;full and complete
platform&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The company chose Linux because consumer electronics manufacturers and
suppliers in the automotive sector have found that traditional proprietary
approaches come with numerous barriers. These include not only integration
and interoperability challenges, but also a lack of the flexibility to create
true differentiation. Wind River says that its platform will improve both
product development and time-to-market concerns.
</p><p>
WRLPI will be optimized for the Intel Atom processor and will offer
pre-integration with third-party networking and multimedia applications,
such as speech-recognition and speech-to-text technologies by Nuance
Communications, Inc.; Bluetooth and echo-cancellation and noise reduction
solutions by Parrot; music management and automatic playlisting
technologies by Gracenote, Inc.; multimedia networking solutions by SMSC;
and DVD playback by Corel's LinDVD.
</p><p>
Wind River's senior VP and GM of the Linux product division, Vincent
Rerolle said that WRLPI will &ldquo;reduce the daunting complexity in the
in-vehicle market&rdquo; and be a &ldquo;disruptive innovation expected to
challenge the traditional approach to proprietary solutions and spawn a
level of creativity not yet seen in this segment&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Other WRLPI features include support for popular audio and video standards;
connectivity with numerous devices, such as the iPod; rich 3-D graphics
support; power-state management; quick booting/initialization and
automotive standards connectivity (for example, CAN and MOST).

Kangaroo TV (<a href="http://www.kangaroo.tv" target="_self">www.kangaroo.tv</a>)</b></p><p>
It's official, folks&mdash;Linux has gone Joe Sixpack. That's because our
beloved OS has infiltrated the world of NASCAR autoracing and other
sporting events. Embedded Linux is the horsepower under the hood of
Kangaroo TV, a new device available for rental at NASCAR (and soon other)
events that gives spectators a more entertaining autoracing experience.
The wireless, handheld Kangaroo TV provides racing fans a slew of event
information, including ten live MPEG-4 video feeds (replays, highlights and
in-car views), 64 AC3 audio feeds (driver-to-pit conversations and
commentary) and a plethora of real-time stats.

</p></div></div><p>
Jean Arseneau, Kangaroo's CTO, says that his firm chose Linux four
years ago for many reasons, including its good fit with the ARM processor,
strong customization possibilities, easier standardized device driver
development, easier graphic application development with embedded Qt,
availability of codec open-source libraries and a small footprint, among
others.
</p><p>
Linux also has allowed Kangaroo to offer advanced features, says Arseneau,
such as video fluidity and audio quality with low latency and a high level
of user customization. The device is upgradeable through the USB port by
becoming a mass storage to the PC.

TomTom GO 930 (<a href="http://www.tomtom.com" target="_self">www.tomtom.com</a>)</b></p><p>
TomTom's GO 930 is one of the slicker portable navigation devices
(PNDs) running Linux that has caught our experts' attention. Just
switch on the GO 930 and get moving, right out of the box, to find any
address in the US, Canada or Europe, complete with turn-by-turn spoken
instructions. Bill Weinberg raves about the TomTom devices because they
offer &ldquo;a great experience at an aggressive price and have features that
I really love&rdquo;. He touts the community-based points of interest and IQ
Routes (explained below), as well as TomTom's humorous approach to
in-car navigation. For instance, you can choose John Cleese's voice to
guide you, chuckling your way from point A to point B.

Although TomTom is coyest of all about sharing information on its Linux
internals, it trumpets the IQ Routes that Weinberg enjoys. These are
optimal driving routes that have been gathered by its users, calculated by
gathering voluntary, anonymous historical driving data from more than seven
million users.
</p><p>
But, the GO 930 isn't the only Linux-driven PND in TomTom's lineup&mdash;all of
the company's products are and have been since 2004.

Our beloved Linux can do almost anything, including producing real, fresh
ice cream in 45 seconds flat! Well, it used to do that anyway. For almost
three years, Linux was the OS inside the MooBella Ice Cream System, a
device that produces hard-packed ice creams fresh to order. The device also
used Firefox and open-source SQL databases. LinuxDevices.com's Henry
Kingman interviewed MooBella's VP of Engineering, Jim Baxter, who spoke
highly of Linux, saying, &ldquo;This product has gotten further than I ever
imagined, in my wildest dreams.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Then in early 2008, MooBella switched manufacturers, the new one a
Windows-only shop chosen for non-OS-related reasons, said Bob Brooks,
MooBella's Director of Marketing. Although we are saddened to see such a
neat device move over to the other side, it's a great feeling to know
that our favorite OS can help make your favorite ice cream!
