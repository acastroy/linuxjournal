Gadgets are tools, but referring to a tool
as a gadget implies a bit of fun. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dab580.0x1ea3460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What on Earth is that, Fran&ccedil;ois? Something to make your job
easier? Come on, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, let's be honest. I don't work you
that hard. So what does that thing do? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> It's a combination
corkscrew, pen, pocket knife, compass, notepad, wine thermometer, music
player and crumber? That's the silliest thing I've ever heard of. You
know I love gadgets as much as you do, but I think you outdo me with
your choices. Our guests are arriving, Fran&ccedil;ois. Pay attention, and I
will show you some really useful gadgets. 
</p><p>
Good evening, everyone. It is wonderful to see you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois has prepared your usual
tables and was just about to get tonight's wine. And, what a wine,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. This 2006 wine from Tuscany is produced by Ornellaia and goes
by the name of Le Volte (Figure 1). It's a rich, full-bodied, almost
chewy red with lots of dark fruit on the palate. Your mouth will
thank you. Fran&ccedil;ois, you'll find our shipment in the east wing of the
cellar, near the secret passageway. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10259f1.large.jpg"><img src="10259f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Sampled and Approved
</p></div></div><p>
These days, software gadgets are designed to exploit the eye-candy
capabilities of modern systems, and we'll look at some of those in a
moment. But, what if your system isn't a modern computer? What if you 
have only limited memory and no high-end graphics system? Have no fear; I've
found a couple gadgets guaranteed to be resource-friendly while still
providing little productive value. The first is necessary for people using
a Linux system who feel they may be missing out on that most important
of Windows tools. Yes, I'm talking about the Blue Screen of Death,
lovingly crafted for Linux by Folkert van Heusden.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10259f2.large.jpg"><img src="10259f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Every computer
needs a Blue Screen of Death&mdash;sort of.
</p></div></div><p>
Get the source from <a href="http://www.vanheusden.com/bsod" target="_self">www.vanheusden.com/bsod</a>,
extract it and then simply type <tt  >make</tt> (or
<tt  >make install</tt>) to
build it. To run it, type <tt  >bsod</tt>. Your console, or terminal
window, displays the Blue Screen of Death. There are no options or flags,
so it's very easy to use.
</p><p>
Of course, the Blue Screen of Death doesn't do much. And, it's nowhere near as
interesting as, say, watching fish in an aquarium. We've got that
taken care of as well with our next gadget. In keeping with our low-tech,
low-end gadget needs, this aquarium doesn't require a graphics
card. It's Kirk Baucom's ASCIIQuarium (Figure 3). The program
displays a variety of fish, the occasional sea monster or man-eating
shark, all in glorious ASCII.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10259f3.large.jpg"><img src="10259f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Fish are endlessly
fascinating to watch, even when they're merely ASCII characters in a
terminal window.
</p></div></div><p>
Believe it or not, ASCIIQuarium is included in the repositories for
various distributions, so you probably don't need to build it. However,
source is available should you choose to go that route. There is no
building to be done because ASCIIQuarium is a single Perl script. It
requires only that you have the Curses and Term::Animation Perl modules
installed. While the aquarium displays its two-dimensional life, you can
press R to force a redraw, P to pause the display
or Q to quit.
</p><p>
If ASCII seems just too, ahem, quaint for a desktop gadget, you'll
be happy to know that you can get a different kind of aquarium with
some nicer graphics. Most modern software gadgets
tend to be small programs that run on your desktop background or
wallpaper. Sometimes they become the background. One such program is
xfishtank (Figure 4), written by Eric Bina. Once again, this
is an easy program to find in your distribution's repositories.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10259f4.large.jpg"><img src="10259f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. xfishtank,
because people need fish swimming across their workspaces.
</p></div></div><p>
Running xfishtank on most systems is as simple as typing the
program name. You also can fire up your program launcher (Alt-F2), and type
<tt  >xfishtank</tt> to populate your aquarium. Whether you see
something right
away depends somewhat on the desktop environment you are running. Most
environments,
GNOME included, don't require any additional steps, but KDE does
need to check with you before allowing programs to run on the desktop
background. Right-click on your desktop, and select Configure Desktop
from the pop-up menu. When the dialog box appears, click the Behavior
icon in the left-hand sidebar. A three-tabbed window appears on the
right-hand side. Look near the top on the General tab, and you'll see a check
box with the words Allow programs in desktop window. Click that check
box, and then click OK. 
</p><p>
I mention this now because you may need
it again with some of our other gadgets. A lot of the newer background
gadgets are small programs that take up a small portion of your screen,
quietly displaying useful information, such as system load, memory usage
or network traffic. But, wouldn't you rather see Tux running around on your
screen, walking across your windows, skateboarding or parachuting
down to your taskbar? Me too. You can thank Robin Hogan for writing
xpenguins to help us out of that productivity conundrum. When you
run xpenguins, Tux, in all the forms I mentioned, suddenly takes over
your screen (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10259f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The penguins
in xpenguins are an industrious lot&mdash;floating, skateboarding, drilling,
walking, reading and more.
</p></div></div><p>
Should you decide your screen isn't busy enough, you can increase
the default number of penguins by using the -n flag. That
default is defined in the current theme. Theme? Did I say theme? If
those wonderful little penguins vying for your attention aren't enough,
you are running the right program, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. One of the really
fun things about xpenguins is that it comes with multiple themes. To
discover those themes, type <tt  >xpenguins -l</tt> at the
command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xpenguins -l
Big Penguins
Bill
Classic Penguins
Penguins
Turtles
</pre>
</p><p>
To select a particular theme, do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xpenguins -t Bill
</pre>
</p><p>
Figure 6 shows the result. Bill, the famous hacker from Red
Mond, wanders across your screen taking away Linux systems and replacing
them with his own brand of OS. Yes, this is a takeoff of the (in)famous
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xbill</em></span> game.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10259f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The evil
hacker known only as Bill can replace those cute little penguins on
your desktop.
</p></div></div><p>
Even more themes are available. Visit the xpenguins
Web site, and check out the user-contributed themes at
<a href="http://xpenguins.seul.org/contrib" target="_self">xpenguins.seul.org/contrib</a>. Before we move on, I
want to mention one last flag available with xpenguins&mdash;the -s
flag. That one makes it possible for you to squish the characters with your
mouse cursor. If you find yourself a little squeamish at the result,
the -b option means no blood.
</p><p>
I could pass the next one by, but I really need to mention
it. It's a little less tasteful, but it's lots of fun if you want to turn off your
coworkers. xcockroach,
written by Nicolas Adenis-Lamarre, generates
a variety of cockroaches that scurry across your screen and hide under
your active windows. Move the window and the critters run off in all
directions. It's pretty disgusting, but certainly entertaining. Unlike
xpenguins, there is no squash function. You can, however, change
themes and behaviors for your roaches. For a full list of options,
type <tt  >xcockroach -h</tt>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10259f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. A close-up
of a roach-infested desktop&mdash;luckily, getting rid of them is as easy as
issuing a kill command.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's get off the nostalgia bus now and take a look at the
modern state of desktop gadgets. KDE 4.1's impressive desktop features a
new desktop shell called Plasma. Plasma is, in a way, the ultimate
gadget&mdash;it's a gadget that runs gadgets. Inside Plasma, you run
programs (or widgets or gadgets) that appear on the desktop. Each of
these programs is commonly referred to as a plasmoid. Plasmoids are
more than programs, however. Each is a containment that can contain
other plasmoids, all of which are, technically, able to communicate with
one another. Plasma, the desktop shell, is just one big containment that
contains other plasmoids. The panel at the bottom of the screen with its
system-tray icons, taskbar, clock and program launcher is yet another
containment. Shakespearean fans can think of it as a play within a play.
</p><p>
Plasmoids use scalable vector graphics (SVG). These graphics can be
zoomed and rotated smoothly, meaning that plasmoids can live pretty much
anywhere on your desktop, in any size and any orientation. The result is
super-sweet eye candy of the gadget variety.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dab580.0x229d0d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Yes, we have a real issue with this whole gadget
thing. It's called language. Some people call them gadgets, and others refer
to them as widgets. KDE 4.1 calls them both widgets and plasmoids. Other
environments refer to these things as toys. Gadgets and widgets and
plasmoids and toys, oh my! 
</p></div><p>
To add a plasmoid to the KDE 4 desktop, click on that
cashew icon in the top right-hand corner of your screen. A small pop-out
menu appears. If it says Unlock Widgets, make sure you click that
first, then recall the menu. Now, you should see Add Widgets at the top
of that menu (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10259f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Click the
cashew to add desktop widgets, or plasmoids, or gadgets, or whatever
you like to call them.
</p></div></div><p>
When you click Add Widgets, a window labeled Add Widgets 
appears (Figure 9). It contains a list of all the plasmoids 
installed on your system, and each one has a description below its
name. Some of my favorites include Dictionary, a live desktop word lookup;
Luna, a moon-phase display; and the Twitter Microblogging applet. I also
enjoy a variety of clocks, including a classic analog clock as well as a
binary model. Those little yellow sticky notes also are handy. There's
even a plasmoid that pulls in and displays your favorite comic strips
right on your desktop. Figure 9 shows a number of different plasmoids
running on my desktop.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10259f9.large.jpg"><img src="10259f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. KDE 4.1 plasmoids seriously
dress up a desktop. Shown here are the KDE Twitter, Luna, binary and analog
clock, notes, dictionary, calculator and trash plasmoids. 
</p></div></div><p>
While the plasmoids are unlocked, you can pause over any of them
to fade in the controls (Figure 10). Each has a rotate handle,
a resize handle and a button to close the plasmoid. Many, though not all,
also are configurable and offer a settings icon.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10259f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

handles (or buttons) fade in when you hover over a plasmoid, letting
you rotate, resize, configure or close the plasmoid.
</p></div></div><p>
Running all these cool desktop gadgets is great, but what
if you've got a dozen windows open, and you want to re-read today's
comic? Minimizing all those windows can be a pain, but it's one you
don't need to suffer. Press Ctrl-F12, and the Plasma dashboard
jumps to the forefront of your running windows, letting you see
and interact with any of your plasmoids.
</p><p>
The last item on tonight's menu comes from those gadget-crazy
people over at Google who come to us with the aptly named Google
Gadgets. Unlike plasmoids, you can't rotate them, and they live
only on your current virtual desktop, but the sheer number of gadgets,
not to mention coolness factor, makes Google Gadgets a must. I
was able to install Google Gadgets for my system from the Mandriva
repositories, so check yours first. You also can get the latest from
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux" target="_self">code.google.com/p/google-gadgets-for-linux</a>.
</p><p>
When you install Google Gadgets for Linux, you'll find that there
are two versions of the code: one for the Qt toolkit (KDE) and
another for GTK (GNOME). When you first run the program (with a
shortcut command named <tt  >ggl</tt>), an icon appears in your system
tray. To add gadgets to your desktop, right-click the icon and select
Add Gadgets. Figure 11 shows a sampling Google Gadgets running
on my desktop. There's a nice flowerpot that requires you to water
and care for the flowers in order for them to grow (ignore the flowers and
they wither and die). If, like me, you never can have enough trivia,
check out the Absolut Trivia gadget (yes, that Absolut), which displays
a new piece of trivia every few seconds. To help me make decisions,
I've got a Magic 8 Ball. The weather, always important, shows up in a
cool weather globe. And, of course, when I've been working too long,
the RSI Break gadget tells me to take a break.

Figure 11. A sample of the hundreds of gadgets available from Google Gadgets for
Linux.
</p></div></div><p>
One gadget you likely won't need by the time you read this is the
George Bush &ldquo;days left in office&rdquo; countdown gadget, which is either
a countdown to freedom and renewed sanity, or a dark day for American
politics, depending on where you sit on the GBW fence. Although I can't say
for sure, I suspect that an Obama or McCain countdown timer probably
is in the works. 
</p><p>
There are tons of gadgets available, so how do you choose?
When you select Add Gadgets from the system-tray icon, it fires up
the Gadget Browser. Using the Gadget Browser (Figure 12), you can
select from hundreds of gadgets, categorized according to
interest and function, as well as new and updated gadgets. Those created
by Google have their own category.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10259f12.large.jpg"><img src="10259f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Google's Gadget Browser lets you select from several categories of
gadgets, including those created by Google.
</p></div></div><p>
For instance, click on Lifestyle, and you will be able to choose from
more than 150 gadgets that do all sorts of wonderful things, including display
horoscopes, recipes, quotes from various sources or pictures from the
world's greatest beaches. You know, that last one doesn't sound half bad.
</p><p>
Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I fear it is that time again. The hour
is late,
and closing time is upon us. As you have seen, useful tools need not
be all business, just as business in this fine restaurant is, in fact,
much closer to pleasure. With one of the world's finest wine cellars
and undoubtedly the finest waiter in the world, how could it be anything
else? Speaking of whom, Fran&ccedil;ois, kindly refill our guests' glasses a
final time. Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, raise your glasses and
let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
