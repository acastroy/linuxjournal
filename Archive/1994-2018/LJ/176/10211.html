Nokia Internet tablets are more than just small Webpads and e-mail
appliances. Take a look and see just what they're capable of doing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2303580.0x23fb250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been a fan of tiny computing devices for a long, long time. I started
my obsession for having a &ldquo;PC in your pocket&rdquo; with the Hewlett-Packard
95LX and stayed with that platform for a long time&mdash;graduating to
a 100LX, then a 200LX. The 200LX was eminently hackable, as it was
basically a PC/XT running DOS 5.0 with CGA graphics. At one point, I had
the 200LX doing some crazy things, including acting as a mobile Internet
terminal while I was on vacation touring Europe. 
</p><p>
I then moved on 
to the Palm line of organizers, but although the features grew, the
ability to hack the system slowly diminished. I'd pretty much given
up on an easy-to-hack portable PC, until Nokia released its series
of Internet tablets. Once I saw the N800 in action, I knew I had to get
my grubby paws on one and see just how far the little platform could be
hacked. I'm happy to say, I haven't been disappointed.
</p><p>
Nokia has released three models of Internet tablets at the time of this
writing: the 770, N800 and N810. The 770 was basically the prototype
Internet tablet, while the N800 and N810 are very similar in basic
architecture. Because the 770 is somewhat unique, this
article applies only to the N800 and N810. The Nokia Internet tablets
have been covered in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> before&mdash;the N800 actually won the
&ldquo;Ultimate Linux Handheld&rdquo; award in September 2007. Doc Searls and Jim
Thompson wrote an article in that same issue and demonstrated the device's
value when paired with a Bluetooth GPS and a cellular phone. That's one
type of hack for the tablet, but there are many others.
</p><p>
The first &ldquo;hack&rdquo; anyone should do to the tablet is to flash it to
the latest version of the operating system, if that's not been done
already. The N800 ships by default with OS2007 (maemo 3.2, code-name
Bora), and the N810 ships with OS2008 (maemo 4.0, code-name
Chinook). However, a new version of OS2008 was released in June 2008
(maemo 4.1, code-name Diablo) that enabled over-the-air upgrading,
much like apt-get does for Debian-based laptops and desktops. If you
are <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> running this on your tablet, that's the first hack you should do.
</p><p>
The full instructions for updating your tablet are available on Nokia's
wiki (see Resources), but I
summarize them here. To update the OS on your tablet, the first thing
you should do is run the internal backup utility (found in the Settings
menu), back up the contents of the tablet, and then transfer the contents
of that backup to your PC. Next, download the Linux &ldquo;flasher&rdquo; utility and
the latest firmware image for your particular tablet to your PC. Ensure
that
the battery on your tablet is fully charged, power off the tablet, and
connect the tablet to your PC. Finally, execute the flasher utility as
root with a similar command line as shown on the wiki, and plug the tablet in to
the charger. The flasher utility displays messages as the firmware
load progresses, and the tablet reboots automatically. That's it!
</p><p>
A tiny but very useful &ldquo;hack&rdquo; for the Internet tablet is to populate
it with large Flash media (SD cards on the N800, miniSD cards on the
N810) and use it as a USB storage device. Nokia had the foresight to
give the tablet the ability to look like a USB mass storage device to
a PC when a USB cable is connected. I have two 8GB SD cards in my N800,
and I always leave a couple gigs of storage available on one of the
cards, so that in a pinch, I can jack the tablet up to a PC and use it as
a portable hard disk. It has come in handy more than once.
</p><p>
Another useful &ldquo;hack&rdquo; that's really easy is installing Linux
applications that have been ported to the tablet. One of my favorite
applications on the tablet is the popular IM application Pidgin, as shown
in Figure 1. Although the Nokia tablets come with an XMPP-compliant Jabber
client, I find that having a consistent UI and behavior from desktop to
laptop to tablet is really nice. Getting Pidgin installed on the tablet is
really easy, as it's in the official Nokia software repositories. Simply
fire up the Application Manager from the Settings menu, search for
Pidgin, and click install. The launcher for Pidgin will be in the
Extras section of the menu.

</p></div></div><p>
Of course, a Linux machine of any kind isn't really complete until it runs
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LXDoom</em></span> has been ported to
the tablet, and it runs just great, as shown in Figure 2. The controls take a little getting used
to, due to the nature of the touchscreen and the directional pad on the
tablet, but the game runs with a very playable framerate. Other
games have been ported to the tablet, including <span   class="emphasis"><em>Battle of
Wesnoth</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Nethack</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bomberman</em></span> and even
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>.

</p></div></div><p>
Another really interesting hack for the Nokia tablets is using
them to emulate other computing environments. ACCESS (the owners of the Palm
operating system) has released a free (as in beer) Virtual Machine
(VM) for Nokia tablets that allows PalmOS applications to run on the
tablet. To install the VM on your tablet, go to the link provided in
the Resources section of this article, and register to download the VM. A
link for downloading the VM will be sent to you via e-mail. Open that
e-mail message on your tablet and click the link, and you'll be sent to a site
where you can agree to the EULA and download the binaries. Make sure to
open the package in the Application Manager, and it will 
install automatically after you click OK in a couple dialogs. 
</p><p>
Once you launch
the application, you will see a start screen (Figure 3) where you can
select the PalmOS app you want to run. Click the app, and then
click Launch, and the VM launches that app (Figure 4). Once the
app starts, you are in a PalmOS VM, and you can even call up a PalmOS
&ldquo;home&rdquo; screen by clicking on the house icon (Figure 5). This
comes in very handy if you are a recovering Palmaholic who's got that
one killer app you haven't been able to find on any other platform
(TealAuto is that one for me!).

Other emulators have been
ported to the tablet as well, such as Basilisk (if you are a fan of old
Macintosh applications), DOSBox for old DOS programs or games and Bochs
(if you want to try your hand at running Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 on
your tablet). There are documented cases in the Nokia forums of people
running Windows 95 and even Word 6.0 on their tablets.
</p><p>
The tablets also make great IP
telephones. Not only is there a Skype
client for the unit, but there also are fring and Gizmo clients, as well
as the Web-enabled Google-based Grandcentral. The
Internet Tablet Talk forum has a post that describes how to tie a free Gizmo and a
free Grandcentral account together to get 100% free land-line phone calls
from your Nokia tablet. Other than the Gizmo account and software, there
are no real &ldquo;hacky&rdquo; things needed, other than a willingness to tie two
services together in a way that neither provider envisioned.
</p><p>
So far, I've touched on some of the easier software hacks you can do that
will extend your tablet. You can
perform other more-advanced hacks on both the OS and hardware, but you need to have one thing
before you can proceed with them, and that's a root shell. 
</p><p>
In previous
versions of the tablet's OS, this was truly a hack. In OS2008 (Diablo)
this has been turned into an installable package, so it's really easy
now. Simply open the Application Manager, search for the rootsh
package and install it. Then, once you have a shell open in the X
terminal, run <tt  >rootsh</tt>, and you will have root access to your tablet.
</p><p>
Once you've got a root shell, you really can start digging into the
OS of the tablet. One of my favorite hacks is to run the OS off an SD
card rather than the internal Flash disk. Not only is it faster if you
have a Class 6 SD card, you also can partition the disk so that you'll
have more space for applications, and you still will have the internal
Flash copy of the OS in the event that you break something. 
</p><p>
This process is
documented in full on the maemo.org wiki (see Resources), but the steps are actually pretty easy and can be summarized
in this article. First, you need to have the root shell enabled on your
tablet as described above. Then, you need to partition the SD card into
two partitions: the first partition is a FAT32 partition for your
data, and the second is an ext2 partition for the copy of the tablet's
OS. After you've prepared the card, you need to install some packages
from the command line (wget, tar, an upgrade script called nupgrade.sh
and a couple tablet-specific packages like initfs_flasher). initfs_flasher
flashes the boot sector of the internal Flash disk to pop up a boot menu
that lets you boot the tablet from internal Flash, an SD/MMC card
or an external device like a USB memory stick.
</p><p>
Once initfs_flasher
has finished doing its magic and you have set the default boot device,
you're ready to clone the OS to the SD card. This is as easy as becoming
root on the tablet and running the nupgrade.sh script with the proper
arguments. Note that you'll run it five times according to the wiki&mdash;this lets you monitor each step of the way. The steps are as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Creating the ext2 filesystem on partition two of the SD card.
</p></li><li><p>
Temporarily mounting partition two as /opt.
</p></li><li><p>
Temporarily mounting the rootfs as /floppy.
</p></li><li><p>
Cloning the OS from /floppy to /opt.
</p></li><li><p>
Committing the filesystem updates and umounting /floppy and /opt.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The device reboots when it's done, and the boot menu pops up. At
that point, just select what you want to boot from the menu. If you're
really feeling adventurous, try &ldquo;Advanced Booting&rdquo; your
tablet,
so you can boot multiple copies of the OS from the card. The wiki
has an example procedure that shows how you can set up a card to have a
2GB data partition and boot five different copies or versions of the
tablet OS! Just the thing for the curious tablet user.
</p><p>
All of these hacks have dealt with the software or firmware of the
tablet in one way or another. A very useful hardware hack is enabling
a USB host mode on the tablet. The tablet as shipped is a USB device,
suitable for hooking to a PC and showing up as a device attached to
that PC. A tablet, running in USB host mode, would be able to utilize
a full-size keyboard and USB disk drives, effectively making it more of
a PC. This previously was a hardware-only hack, requiring soldering
special USB cables to put the USB port into host mode. 
</p><p>
With OS2008,
Nokia put software hooks into the OS to allow users to flip the port
into host mode. This is enabled by a small package called USBControl,
which is in the Nokia repositories as well, and it can be installed via
the Application Manager. Once you run USBControl, switching from device
to host is as easy as touching a button. Then, simply hook up the device you
want
to use with the tablet using any adapters that are necessary, and
that's it (assuming there are drivers for that device in the OS). Most
input devices and storage devices are enabled out of the box.
</p><p>
The Nokia N800 and N810 are both great little devices and are much more
than the sum of their parts, thanks to their open-source heritage and
Nokia's willingness to allow them to be extended and hacked in this
fashion. Kudos to all the maemo.org developers and hardware engineers
for creating such a hackable and fun platform!

Getting more information on the tablets and their extensibility is easy,
thanks to excellent documentation on the Internet about
these units. The first stop when looking for information should be the
maemo.org site. This site is the home for all things tablet-related, from
the Nokia wiki, to the software repositories, as well as the software
updates and source code archives. It's all on maemo.org&mdash;except for
the true hacks. Those can be found in the archives of the Internet Tablet
Talks forums. The people there have come up with some truly amazing hacks
and other really neat ways of using the tablets, and there's something
new almost every day there.
