Google makes good on an ancient Netscape promise.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b95580.0x1c8d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What Netscape was to Web 1.0, Google is to Web 2.0. Like Netscape, Google
is Net-native, pioneering, hacker-friendly, generous and likable. It
charges for some stuff, but it gives away the most popular stuff for free.
That's because it groks the Because Effect: you make money because of what
you give away for free. Netscape made money with server software because
it gave away the browser. Google makes money with advertising because
it gives away search&mdash;and a growing portfolio of other services and
applications that create vast new environments where advertising can be
placed.
</p><p>
But, one gets major d&eacute;j&agrave; vu watching Google succeed at doing exactly what
Netscape wanted to do more than a decade ago, which was make the Web itself
into a platform, with the browser serving as a kind of operating system.
Netscape failed that mission for a variety of reasons, the most obvious of
which was taunting Microsoft. In a long <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> story about the Microsoft
antitrust case (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html" target="_self">www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html</a>), John Hieleman wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...here was Andreessen publicly proclaiming in the summer of 1995 that
Netscape's plan was to reduce Windows to &ldquo;a poorly debugged set of device
drivers.&rdquo; &ldquo;They didn't save it up&rdquo;, Myhrvold said.
&ldquo;They f*cking pulled up
alongside us and said, 'Hey, sorry, that guy's already history.'&rdquo;
</p><p>
The tactic drove Redmond into a rage. The day after Andreessen's quote
appeared in the press, John Doerr, the prominent venture capitalist and
Netscape board member, received a chilling e-mail from Jon Lazarus, one of
Gates' key advisers. In its entirety, it read, &ldquo;Boy waves large red flag in
front of herd of charging bulls and is then surprised to wake up
gored.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That was back when Microsoft was still, as Bill Gates loved to say, &ldquo;hard
core&rdquo;. It was at the top of its game, which was Xtreme Business
Hardball. There are legal limits on how hard you can play that game, as
Microsoft found out when the feds went after the company. But Netscape's
wounds were also self-inflicted. As I put it in &ldquo;The Shrinking
Subject&rdquo;
in 2000 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4159" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4159</a>),
&ldquo;For a year or two, Netscape looked like it could do no wrong. It was a
Miata being chased down a mountain road by a tractor trailer. As long as it
moved fast and looked ahead, there was no problem with the truck behind.
But at some point, Netscape got fixated on the rear-view mirror. That's
where it was looking when it drove off the cliff.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It also failed to execute. As I put it in that same article, &ldquo;Worst of
all, it bloated the browser from a compact, single-purpose tool to an
immense contraption that eventually included authoring software, a
newsgroup reader, a conferencing system and an e-mail client&mdash;all of
which were done better by standalone applications.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Today, Netscape is a skin mounted on an AOL wall. Netscape.com now
redirects to netscape.aol.com. And the last Netscape Navigator-branded
browser rolled off the line early this year. Meanwhile, Google has authoring
software (Blogger), a whole e-mail system (Gmail), all of Usenet, Google
Groups, an on-line calendar, a document system and lots of other stuff.
Some of it (Google Toolbar, Gmail) can bloat a browser, but only if the
user wants it. Otherwise, Google has seemed content to let its spin-off,
Mozilla, with Firefox, gradually eat away at Microsoft's dominant browser
share&mdash;both by being a good product and by serving as host to an endless
variety of extensions and plugins.
</p><p>
That is, until early September 2008. That's when Google announced
Chrome&mdash;a
new browser that really does serve the role of an operating system. Google
explained Chrome through a 39-page series of illustrations in comic book
style by the brilliant Scott McCloud
(<a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome" target="_self">www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome</a>). With Chrome, tabs aren't just for Web
pages. They're for processes, &ldquo;each having its own memory and its own copy
of the global data structure&rdquo;. Sound familiar? The doc adds, &ldquo;We're
applying the same kind of process isolation you find in modern operating
systems. Separate processes rendering separate tabs.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Chrome uses WebKit, the open-source rendering engine that began as KDE's
KHTML software library, then grew through work by Apple and a list of other
companies that now include Nokia, Trolltech, Adobe and Google. Chrome also
adds a pile of other new browser building materials, including Gears and
the V8 JavaScript engine. All are open source (using the BSD license).
</p><p>
The Chrome comic concludes, &ldquo;We hope v8's performance will set a new bar,
and that the other development teams will continue to improve in this
space. Because if you look at any other system that's become faster over time,
what happens is you get bigger, better, more inventive apps.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Especially Google's huge back-end apps that run in the cloud. In his blog,
Nick Carr writes, &ldquo;To Google, the browser has become a weak link in the
cloud system&mdash;the needle's eye through which the outputs of the company's
massive data centers usually have to pass to reach the user&mdash;and as a
result, the browser has to be rethought, revamped, retooled, modernized.
Google can't wait for Microsoft or Apple or the Mozilla Foundation to make
the changes...so Google is jump-starting the process with Chrome.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Netscape may have lost the &ldquo;browser war&rdquo; long ago, but Google is winning at
a different game entirely&mdash;one in which the browser is just a way of
organizing applications, documents and other things users need to make the
most of where they all now live, which is on the Net&mdash;not on a desktop
operating system. And, let's not forget that most of the cloud's services
run on Linux servers, including nearly all of Google's.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, Chrome is still available only for Windows. Google promises
Mac and Linux versions as soon as possible. When Chrome comes out on Linux,
it will be interesting to see if it will be to Linux's advantage to have a
browser, rather than an operating system, serving as an application
framework.
If that's the case, maybe the best-debugged set of device drivers will
finally win on the desktop too.
