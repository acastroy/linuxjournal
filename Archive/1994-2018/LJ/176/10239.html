<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #176, December 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>NILFS2 filesystem</b></span> is a new versioning filesystem, hot off the
presses from <span   class="bold"><b>Ryusuke Konishi</b></span>. This
filesystem does continuous data
snapshotting, so that immediate recovery is possible after any
inadvertent file deletion or corruption. The project has the support
of <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>, who has put it in his own tree for wider
distribution and testing. At this stage, the on-disk data format is
nearly stable according to Ryusuke, but that will be a key issue in
getting the code accepted into the main tree. Once the code is
accepted, any changes in disk format almost certainly will have to
include support for all previous formats. In general, this is extremely
undesirable in a filesystem, so it's likely that Ryusuke will try to
finalize the data format before submitting the code to <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan Corbet</b></span> has written lots of extremely useful kernel
documentation, including O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device
Drivers</em></span>. Recently,
he wrote a fairly long <span   class="bold"><b>intro to kernel
development</b></span>, intended for
developers employed by companies who support their kernel work. The
goal is to make sure those companies understand what to expect from
the developer community and from the relationship between their
engineers and that community. This is an excellent document, filled
with detailed advice and explanations to help newcomers understand how
best to get their features into the kernel. Jonathan has submitted the
work for inclusion in the Documentation directory of the kernel
sources, though it also may appear on <a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a> at some point.
</p><p>
The old <span   class="bold"><b>FireWire wiki</b></span>, having been overrun by spammers, is being
replaced. <span   class="bold"><b>Stefan Richter</b></span> created <a href="http://ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org" target="_self">ieee1394.wiki.kernel.org</a>, which is
already more up to date than the old spammy one, and it's better maintained
as well. Those pesky spammers! When we all have nanotech brain
implants, will the spammers get into those as well?
</p><p>
Reporting <span   class="bold"><b>BIOS bugs</b></span> to user space may be useful or it may just be
overkill. <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Renninger</b></span> has been working on this though. Various
subsystems, such as ACPI and PCI, can introduce BIOS bugs, and the
kernel has to sanity-check all of them. Thomas' argument is that
user-space code would get several benefits from having access to the
results of this sanity checking. Applications would be easier to test;
they'd be better able to respond to the bugs when they were
encountered; and users debugging their systems would be better able to
identify the problems. Thomas wants to log all of these BIOS bugs to
the system log files, where any user-space program could access them.
On the flip side, as <span   class="bold"><b>Bjorn Helgaas</b></span> points out, the specific log
entries for each of these BIOS bugs would have to be maintained
individually, and new ones would have to be created by hand. The whole
infrastructure would be subject to rapid aging, just like on that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek</em></span> episode, except without the miraculous cure. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span>
thought the benefits would outweigh the risks, offering various
implementation suggestions, and even Bjorn had implementation
suggestions of his own. So, it does seem likely we'll be seeing BIOS
bug logging coming out of the kernel soon.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>MTD subsystem</b></span> is being worked over
pretty well to try to support
Flash drives greater than 2GB. <span   class="bold"><b>Bruce
Leonard</b></span> has been leading
this charge, although unfortunately, he hit some technical obstacles
when he modified the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel ABI</b></span> (Application Binary Interface). This
is a real no-no, but as <span   class="bold"><b>Tim Anderson</b></span> points out, it may be
necessary only to extend the ABI rather than actually change its existing
interfaces. Once Bruce and others figure out the right interface for
it, it's a dead certainty we'll be getting large Flash drive support
in the kernel, probably very soon.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Woodhouse</b></span> has been following up on his effort to remove all
<span   class="bold"><b>binary firmware</b></span> from the kernel. This controversial effort is inspired
by the fact that it's weird having lots of binary-only data in an
open-source project. But, weird as it is, it's been very convenient for
kernel developers to have the firmware in the tree. David's effort
involves extracting all those binary blobs into a single firmware git
repository, which he has now created. He's also opening up the tree
not only to firmware that has been distributed with kernel sources,
but also to all firmware everywhere that vendors want to make available to
Linux users. So, we'll see what comes of that, and whether they run into
similar conflicts as those between kernel developers and GCC
developers, where members of each project blame certain problems on
the other project, leading to long-term disputes. This is less likely
in David's firmware project, as the kernel folks could easily just
revert to including their selected firmware blobs in the kernel again
if there are any real disputes. Time will tell.

<h2 class="title">The Dell IdeaStorm Index</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #176, December 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The Dell IdeaStorm site (<a href="http://www.dellideastorm.com" target="_self">www.dellideastorm.com</a>) was an inspired move by the company, providing a
way for the market to tell a major supplier what to do, rather than the
reverse, which has been the default for the whole Industrial Age.
</p><p>
When the site first went up, it sustained what we might call an Insistence
on Service Attack by Linux and open-source geeks. Since then, however, the
pressure hasn't let up. At the time of this writing (on September 10, 2008), the same kind
of demand is there.
</p><p>
What we see with IdeaStorm now is a rolling picture&mdash;almost a
scroll&mdash;of market demand. Here's the current list in the order the
items appear on the
page:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Put Ubuntu on the list of operating systems when building a PC.
</p></li><li><p>
No more plastic wrap, please.
</p></li><li><p>
BIOS upgrades that don't require Windows.
</p></li><li><p>
Provide Linux drivers for all your hardware.
</p></li><li><p>
Standardize power cables for laptops.
</p></li><li><p>
Can we get Studio Hybrid with Ubuntu?
</p></li><li><p>
There should be an option of having no trialware on all computers.
</p></li><li><p>
Please make the Ubuntu XPS Notebook cheaper than the XPS Vista Notebook.
</p></li><li><p>
Use magsafe power connectors.
</p></li><li><p>
Pre-installed OpenOffice.org | alternative to MS Works &amp; MS Office.
</p></li><li><p>
When you choose not to implement an idea, explain why.
</p></li><li><p>
Mini 9 Netbook Ubuntu price must be cheaper than the XP price with same
config.
</p></li><li><p>
Have Firefox pre-installed as default browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Switch to LED monitors.
</p></li><li><p>
Quit forcing McAfee subscriptions.
</p></li><li><p>
Tell us what Wi-Fi chipset a laptop has.
</p></li><li><p>
Backlit keyboards.
</p></li><li><p>
Stop overcharging on notebook RAM.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To sum up, customers want practical improvements, transparency, promotional
crap removal and Linux/Ubuntu support (the latter shows up four times).
Maybe some other makers will start listening too.

<h2 class="title">Going MoBile</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #176, December 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>WAP Review</em></span> calls <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s
mobile site, <a href="http://m.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">m.linuxjournal.com</a>, &ldquo;a
beauty&rdquo; and adds, &ldquo;No tiny dumbed-down mobile site, it features just about
everything found on the full site, including archives, commenting, forums
and videos in mobile format.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For that, we also can thank MoFuse (<a href="http://mofuse.com" target="_self">mofuse.com</a>), which hit the streets last summer with a
slick Linux-based way of cutting the cruft out of Weblogs and presenting
them readably on mobile phones and other handhelds (we gave the company a
mention in &ldquo;Laundering Blog Layouts for Mobile Devices&rdquo; in the
Upfront section of our October 2008
issue).
</p><p>
Now that MoFuse has put some rubber on the road, we thought it was a good
time to hit David Berube, Founder &amp; Chief Architect of MoFuse, with a few
questions about his fledgling business and Linux's role in it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10239mofusef1.large.jpg"><img src="10239mofusef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
David Berube
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> How's it going so far?
</p><p>
DB: We are now approaching 14,000 mobile sites, and we just raised a seed
round of funding from the Slater Fund in Providence, Rhode Island&mdash;our home town.
We're moving quickly!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> What got you going with Linux?
</p><p>
DB: I chose Linux for a few reasons: 1) it's powerful and can do the job
we need at MoFuse really well; 2) it's open, and that is key to how I'm
working as an entrepreneur and how our small team can be so efficient; and
3) it's inexpensive&mdash;another key factor for a company just starting out.
</p><p>
Linux being free means a lot to an entrepreneur. Using Microsoft would have
cost me more to get going when compared to a Fedora install. Also, there
are many avenues out there I can reach out to for free and get help&mdash;more
so on an open platform because it is community-driven. When I have a
problem, I can almost always find the answer using a quick Google search.
In the past, when I was using Windows servers, the answer or solution wasn't
easily accessible.
</p><p>
Basically, Linux has enabled MoFuse to create what it is today and
indirectly help foster the mobile Web. I'm sure these are things you've
heard numerous times before, but it is very true for MoFuse.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> Well, we've heard some of the same rationales before, but fostering the
mobile Web from an open-source angle is somewhat new. How are you doing
that?
</p><p>
DB: Lots of ways, but one that comes to mind is the OpenX (<a href="http://www.openx.org" target="_self">www.openx.org</a>) ad server. The
OpenX team has done a fabulous job with it, and it's a great product. It's
not in production, but we are working with it heavily behind the scenes to
convert it to a mobile ad server. On our side, we're making modifications so
that we can use it as our primary mobile ad server.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS:</b></span> How about the larger mobile Web? Any handheld platforms you prefer?
</p><p>
DB: I'm very excited about Android and the prospects for a mainstream open-source mobile operating system using Linux. This will lower barriers for
smaller companies and help further the growth of mobile far beyond where it
is today&mdash;and hopefully, help drive the handset costs down so more
consumers can have access to smartphones.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> One thing I like about MoFuse is that it cuts the bloat out of blogs
and everything else that runs through it. Do you think this will have a
positive influence on blog design and send some hints to the authoring
software development folks?
</p><p>
DB: I don't know. When I design anything, I do it with two things in mind,
the user (viewer) and simplicity. I think MoFuse reflects that, and my
personal blog (<a href="http://blog.daveberube.com" target="_self">blog.daveberube.com</a>) certainly does. I
like simple; I'm a
fan of 37signals because of its take on design, and I try to bring that
same take into projects I work on. But, as you know, some of the bigger
blogs need to make space for advertising, and that can really clutter a
design. There needs to be a balance between design and revenue.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> I have a hope that mobile platforms,
as they become more popular, will
drive development in the direction of simplicity. If that happens, what
will you be looking for from other developers, bloggers, Web site designers
and your own team?
</p><p>
DB: With anything, you begin to see features creep in. It's a battle every
developer wages, and it's not easy. You really need to figure out what is
needed and what isn't. The good thing about mobile is that applications and
Web sites need to be simple in order for them to function. For example,
there is no mouse, so you must make the user interface simple to use in
order for users to be able to do the things they need.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span> Speaking of thin and lightweight, have you checked out Dave Winer's
&ldquo;news river&rdquo; concept? The best example is <a href="http://nytimesriver.com" target="_self">nytimesriver.com</a>, which Dave put
together for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span>, but which it seems to have ignored.
</p><p>
DB: Yes, I have. It's straight to the point, is what it is. Nothing more,
nothing less&mdash;perfect.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS:</b></span> Let's talk about the iPhone. My own view is that Apple has created a
very slick data device that also happens to be a phone. It points toward a
phone business that needs to be a data business. Meanwhile, the other phone
makers have many different devices, with many different SDKs. This
encourages developers to come to this one very capable platform, even
though Apple is its one huge gatekeeper.
</p><p>
DB: Apple really has created not just a great device, but a whole new
concept that flies in the face of the carriers, including its partner
AT&amp;T. Jobs has really leveraged the Apple brand to bend carriers to its
needs, although Apple did cave in a little with the iPhone 3G and the
forced contract with AT&amp;T that subscribers now need to sign.
</p><p>
What I dislike about Apple's iPhone and the App Store are its limitations. Why
are there limitations? Why can't a developer create video recording
software? Why can't developers create navigational software? Why does Apple
get to be the gatekeeper to what gets exposed to the users? Why can't the
users be their own gatekeepers?
</p><p>
It also stifles innovation! A company isn't going to invest $100,000 in
developing new software for the iPhone, if there is no guarantee that Apple
even will approve of the software. Apple wants you to invest your time and
money into developing for its platform, but there is always a risk that
iPhone users never will get a chance to see it themselves. If that happens,
you virtually have no other avenue to get to all those millions of iPhone
users, except maybe marketing it to jail-broken phones. I just hope that
over time, Apple will open up the platform a little more. We could really see
some cool things if it did that.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS:</b></span> Meanwhile, on the Linux side, I've discovered some of the phones can't
do sound yet. Can they compete? How?
</p><p>
DB: That will change. Sound is moving forward. If you don't have it now,
you will have it soon.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
DS:</b></span> And, you think Android will make it happen?
</p><p>
DB: Hope so. The problem Android is going to have is that the carriers are
still going to try to lock down the operating system. It's going to be an
OS that is fractured, because it's not going on one single device but on
many. That means developers are going to have to create applications that
work for devices with and without a touchscreen, with and without a QWERTY
keyboard, with 3G and Wi-Fi and without. The list goes on. That's a challenge,
but hopefully what Android can do is at least create a standard moving
forward.
</p><p>
It's up to the carriers. If they don't lock down the operating system and
really let it be a true sandbox for developers, I'm positive we will
see great innovation. The mobile phone is capable of doing so much. It's a
device that we always have with us, and it's always on. It's the most
personal computing device we have.

was headquartered in Seattle, not far west of U-Dub: the University of
Washington. RL is one of many old UNIX/Linux hands in the Alpha Geek circle
there.

I ran into Bob again at Digital ID World in September 2008, in one of the few
open-source sessions held there. He sat in the back row, worn laptop on his
knees, and asked Knowing Questions. So, I immediately asked him to be the
object of our subject for this month. Here's how he ran down his goods:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
My laptop is a three-year-old IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad X41 (non-tablet), now running
Fedora 9. I have used a series of &ldquo;ultralight&rdquo; ThinkPads for perhaps a
dozen years (560Z, X21, X31 and now X41), and run Red Hat or Fedora Linux on
every one. I do all my work on my laptop and carry it everywhere, so
lightness, durability and stability are key. This combination has worked
for me.
</p><p>
In my job (identity management architect for the University of Washington
and Internet2), I do lots of e-mail (4,000 messages sent per year, average 200
incoming per workday). I use Pine, for much the same reasons as above for
my choice of laptop and OS: it's fast, very stable and keeps on working
year after year. It's nice to know that the folks who write it work
upstairs from me, but I haven't needed any special support.
</p><p>
Maybe the most retro choice on this machine is the Window Maker window
manager. It hasn't changed much at all in the last several years, but once
again, it's fast and keeps on working. I live happily switching among my
20 virtual desktops with well-practiced keystrokes, and don't miss all
those fancy features.
</p><p>
Like anyone else, I use modern full-featured apps like Firefox and
OpenOffice.org, but if I'm not reading or composing e-mail in Pine, I'm
probably taking notes in Emacs. I guess I'm just a retro kinda guy.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And it's great to have those guys around.
