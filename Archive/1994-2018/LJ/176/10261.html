Want to make sure your application will scale? Consider memcached,
which allows you to speed up response time, as well as reduce the load on
your database server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3f580.0x1037358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the watchwords for modern Web developers is scalability.
Whether we're following the latest news about Twitter's servers or
writing our own applications, developers always are thinking about
whether their system will be scalable.
</p><p>
This issue has been particularly prominent during the spring and summer
of 2008, as Ruby on Rails (my preferred platform for Web development)
has been criticized for its use of RAM and its relatively slow
execution speed. The massive server problems that Twitter experienced
during the first half of 2008 were widely described as stemming from
Twitter's use of Rails (despite denials from Twitter's technical
team) and led to speculation that Rails cannot be used for a scalable
application. One of the hosts of the weekly RailsEnvy podcast makes a
point of sarcastically saying that &ldquo;Rails doesn't scale&rdquo; in each
episode, because it was said so frequently.
</p><p>
There's no doubt that Rails is more resource-intensive than many other
application development frameworks. This is partly due to the need
for improvements in the Ruby language itself&mdash;improvements that look
like they'll be available within the coming year. And, it also is true
that the Rails framework uses more CPU and memory than some of its
counterparts, such as Django, because of the nature of the features
that it offers.
</p><p>
But, there's a difference, I believe, between calling Rails
resource-intensive and calling it inherently unscalable. Scalability
has more to do with the architecture and design of an application,
allowing it to grow naturally from a single box containing both the
Web and database servers to a network of servers. A Web application
written in C might execute very quickly and, thus, handle a larger load
on a single server, but that doesn't mean the application is
inherently more scalable. At a certain point, even an efficient C
program will reach its capacity, and if it isn't designed with this in
mind, the more efficient application will be the less scalable one.
</p><p>
So, I tend to think about scalability as an architectural problem,
one that ignores the specific programming language in which an
application is implemented, and which is different from the issue of
execution speed and efficiency. You can have highly scalable programs
written in an inefficient framework, but it does take a bit more
discipline and requires that programmers think carefully about the
way they are writing the code. Even if you're starting
on a single computer, designing the software in a scalable way
allows you to distribute the load (and tasks) across a number of
specialized servers.
</p><p>
One of the most important issues having to do with scalability
actually has little or nothing to do with the Web application
framework on which the program is written. Most modern Web
applications use a relational database for persistent data storage,
which means that the database server can be a bottleneck. Even if the
database server isn't pushing its limits, the fact is that it takes
time for a relational database to process a query, retrieve one or
more appropriate rows and send them back to the querying application.
</p><p>
If your application is highly dynamic, it might use as many as a dozen
SQL calls for each page, which will not only stress your database,
but also significantly reduce the speed with which you can service
each HTTP request. Longer request times mean that your users will be
drumming their fingers longer and that your server will need more
processes to handle the same number of requests.
</p><p>
One solution is to use multiple database servers. There are solutions
for hooking together multiple servers from an open-source database
(for example, PostgreSQL or MySQL), not to mention proprietary (and
expensive) solutions for commercial databases, such as Oracle and
MS-SQL. But, this is a tricky business, and many of the solutions
involve what's known as master-slave replication, in which one
database server (the master) is used for data modification, and the
other (the slave) can be used for reading and retrieving information.
This can help, but it isn't always the kind of solution you need.
</p><p>
But, there is another solution&mdash;one that is simple to understand and
relatively easy to implement: memcached (pronounced
&ldquo;mem-cash-dee&rdquo;). Memcached is an open-source, distributed storage
system that acts as a hash table across a network. You can store
virtually anything you like in memcached, as well as retrieve it
quickly and easily. There are client libraries for numerous
programming languages, so no matter what framework you enjoy using,
there probably is a memcached solution for you.
</p><p>
This month, we take a quick look at memcached. When integrated into a
Web application, it should help make that application more
scalable&mdash;meaning it can handle a large number of users, spread across
a large number of servers, without forcing you to rewrite large
amounts of code. Version 2.1 of Ruby on Rails went so far as to
integrate memcached support into the framework, making it even easier
to use memcached in your applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3f580.0x1037988"></a>
Memcached</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned previously, you can think of memcached as a network-accessible
hash table. Like a hash table, it has keys and values, with a single
value stored per key. Also like a hash table, there aren't a lot of
ways to store and retrieve your data. You can set a key-value pair;
you can retrieve a value based on a key, and you can delete a key.
</p><p>
This might seem like a limited set of functions. And, it is, if you
think of memcached as your primary data store. But, that's exactly the
point. Memcached never was designed to be a general-purpose database
or to serve as the primary persistent storage mechanism for your
application. Rather, it was meant to cache information that you 
already had retrieved from a relational database and that you 
probably were going to need to retrieve again in the near future.
</p><p>
In other words, memcached allows you to make your application more
scalable, letting you take advantage of the fact that data is
fetched repeatedly from the database, often by multiple users. By
first querying memcached and accessing the database only when
necessary, you reduce the load on your database and increase the
effective speed of your Web application.
</p><p>
The main cost to you is the time involved in integrating memcached
into your application, the RAM that you allocate to memcached and the
server(s) that you dedicate to memcached. How many servers you will
want to allocate to memcached depends, of course, on the size and
scale of your Web site. You might need only one memcached server when
you start out, but you might well need to expand to ten, 100 or even
several hundred memcached servers (as I've heard Facebook uses) to
maximize application speed and efficiency.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf3f580.0x1037b98"></a>
Using Memcached</h2></div></div><p>
On my Ubuntu system, I was able to install memcached with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get install memcached
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I started memcached with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/memcached -vv -u reuven
</pre>
</p><p>
The -vv option turns on very verbose logging, allowing me to see
precisely what is happening from the server's perspective. The -u
flag lets me set the user under which memcached will run; it
cannot be run as root, for security reasons.
</p><p>
Now, let's write a short client program to store and retrieve values.
I'm going to write the client program in Ruby, although you can use
almost any language (including Perl, Python or PHP) that you like. I
used the memcache-client Ruby gem to connect to the memcached server,
which I installed by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install memcache-client
</pre>
</p><p>
Here is a short program that connects to the memcached server, stores
a value and then retrieves a value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/ruby

# Load necessary libraries
require 'rubygems'
require 'memcache'

# Create the memcached client
CACHE = MemCache.new 'localhost:11211'

# Set a value
CACHE.set('foo', 'bar')

# Retrieve a value
value = CACHE.get('foo')
puts "Value = '#{value}'"
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the first thing we do is create a client to the
memcached server. You can specify one or more servers; in this case,
we indicate that there is only one, running on localhost, on port
11211. It might surprise you to learn that although memcached is
described as a distributed caching mechanism, the various memcached
servers never speak to one another. Rather, it is the client that
decides on which server it will store a particular piece of data,
and it uses that same algorithm to determine which server should be
queried to retrieve that data.
</p><p>
So in this program, we connect to our server, set a value (much as we
would set it in a hash table) and then retrieve it. It's nothing very
exciting, although the fact that the memcached server might be on
another computer already makes things interesting.
</p><p>
Here is a slight variation on the previous program. Notice the third
argument to CACHE.set, as well as the invocation of sleep afterward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'memcache'

CACHE = MemCache.new 'localhost:11211'

CACHE.set('foo', 'bar', 3)

sleep 5

value = CACHE.get('foo')
puts "Value = '#{value}'"
</pre>
</p><p>
This time, the output looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Value = ''
</pre>
</p><p>
Huh? What happened to our value? Didn't we set it? Yes, we did,
but we told memcached to expire the value after three seconds. This
is one important way that memcached makes it easy to be integrated
into a Web application. You can specify how long memcached should
continue to see this data as valid. By passing no expiration time,
memcached holds onto the value forever. Allowing the data to expire
ensures that cached data is valid.
</p><p>
Just how long you should keep data in the cache is a question
only you can answer, and it probably depends on the type of object
you're storing. Orders from your on-line store probably
should expire after a short period, because they likely will change as
users
visit your site. But, information about users is unlikely to
change once they have registered, so it might make sense to hold
onto that for a longer period of time.
</p><p>
It might seem strange for me to be describing memcached as a
repository for complex objects, such as orders or people. And yet,
memcached is fully able to handle such objects, assuming they are
marshaled and unmarshaled by the client software. Thus, we can have
the following short program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'memcache'

CACHE = MemCache.new 'localhost:11211'

CACHE.set('foo', [:a, :b, 'c', [1,2,3],
        {:blah =&gt; 5, :blahblah =&gt; 10}, Time.now])

value = CACHE.get('foo')
puts "Value = '#{value.map{ |i| i.class}.join(', ')}'"
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, we see that memcached is happy both to set and retrieve
values of a variety of classes. This means that even if we create a
complex class, we can store it in memcached and retrieve it later.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Memcached is an important part of nearly any Web application's
strategy for scaling. It can reduce the time it
takes to access certain types of information dramatically, resulting in faster
response times for users and freeing up the relational database
server for other jobs. Deciding exactly which objects can and should be
stored in memcached and determining how long they should be kept in
the cache before expiring are issues that must be addressed for each
individual application.
</p><p>
Next month, I'll explain how memcached support has been integrated into
Ruby on Rails, making it quite easy to take advantage of this
technology in your own applications&mdash;and, dare I say it, help your
applications become truly scalable.
