Upcoming Topics</h4><p>
Why can't you guys be a little more consistent with the focus on topics?
The ULB issue has been coming out in different months in the last few years,
and it's kind of hit or miss, because I can't seem to find anywhere on your
Web site a little section that would say what's going to be in the next
issue. And, what is up with the ULBs being nothing more than just 
high-end gaming PCs? Whatever happened to real workstations? Is nobody
using those anymore?

You can find our editorial calendar with upcoming topics here <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/xstatic/author/topicsdue" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/xstatic/author/topicsdue</a>. As far as
your ULB question, we've been working with readers to find out exactly what
should constitute a ULB these days. Stay tuned.&mdash;Ed.

A Rant</h4><p>
I am having lots of problems with installers on recent
&ldquo;Linuxes&rdquo;. They all
assume that just because I am installing their OS, it will be my
primary OS. FAIL! My partitions are Kubuntu-swap-spare, and I use the spare
(usually ext3) partition to test new OSes. Every time I do so, I have to
use a live CD to get the bootloader straightened out. What a mess! And, until
I fix it, I can't get any work done with my primary OS.
</p><p>
Slackware gave me a choice: put the bootloader in the MBR or in the
partition superblock. This made chainloading easy. Why can't I get that
choice in any of the Debian/Ubuntu family? They overwrite menu.lst without
warning. I plan on trying a BSD on the spare partition, won't that be
fun?
</p><p>
I also wish GRUB used a single config file. Then, I could save that file to
a thumbdrive and fix things with one command, rather than digging out a
live CD and fumbling with Yet Another Shell Syntax. Say what you will about
lilo, at least it was simple and consistent.

As a longtime software developer working in health care (health
insurance-related applications), I read Doc Searls' &ldquo;Why We Need
Hackers to Fix Health
Care&rdquo; with great interest [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, October 2008]. My company, while our software is Windows-based
and proprietary, struggles daily with interoperability issues with systems
from other vendors with which our applications communicate. No patient
lives are at risk if our applications encounter issues as described by
Doc.
</p><p>
I'm curious about one thing that Doc said. He said that he was &ldquo;using a
Web browser on one of the nursing workstations there. I was surfing for
about ten seconds when every screen in sight went blue.&rdquo; Just what was Doc
doing that caused the issue? Or was it mere coincidence of timing?

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

He was just surfing. Hard to say whether it was coincidence or
timing.&mdash;Ed.

Greetings. I just received my October 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, and one of the wonderful articles I saw was the review
of the HP Media Vault mv series product (mv2xxx and mv5xxx products).
Having played with one for a few months now, I was surprised at the amount
of research that did not go into the review.
</p><p>
For example, take the failure to mention the rather extensive hacking
guide posted at <a href="http://www.k0lee.com/hpmediavault" target="_self">www.k0lee.com/hpmediavault</a> and written by one of the
HP engineers responsible for this product. How can a review of these
devices fail to mention this site? It has links to the source code for the
product, how to replace a drive, re-flash instructions and so on.
</p><p>
Otherwise, it's nice to see an open-source-friendly NAS being reviewed&mdash;especially one that is open and hackable.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Ted Johnson  <br><br>
</p><p>It was merely an oversight. Thank you for pointing out the hacking
guide.&mdash;Ed.

Since you recently mentioned some interest for the FoxyTag speed-camera
warning system [see New Projects, July 2008], I invite you to consult the latest press release at
<a href="http://www.foxytag.com/blog/?p=48" target="_self">www.foxytag.com/blog/?p=48</a>. This article has been copied in many
blogs and some popular Web sites, including mashable.com.

I have been using Linux since the mid-1990s when I had to load a huge stack
of floppies to get a command-line version running. Currently, on my primary
PC, I dual-boot Windows XP and PCLinuxOS. This machine is a five-year-old
home-built machine with an AMD, Socket-A ASUS A7VBX-X motherboard. I keep
using it, because it works great with both XP and Linux. My laptop is an old
Dell C400 that runs Ubuntu 8.04 wonderfully well.
</p><p>
Linux always has worked well for me with the hardware of yesteryear, but
that no longer appears to be the norm. I recently decided to build a dual-core machine to replace my old Socket-A machine. I built up a BioStar
TF8200 A2+ with 4GB of RAM, a SATA primary drive and two more SATA drives
for a RAID-1 /home. I soon discovered that today's new
hardware is
not very Linux-friendly. I have tried many distributions and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span>
distribution can correctly process audio from the motherboard's onboard
Realtek ALC888 audio chip combined with the NVIDIA support chipset.
Likewise, there are problems with the onboard NVIDIA GF8200 graphics. Only
Sabayon Linux can use it &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;. It is a nightmare. Of
course, Windows XP runs all of the hardware just fine.
</p><p>
My issue is that, today, it is very, very difficult to build a modern
system that is Linux-compatible. I encourage you to work with motherboard
and peripheral boards to advertise the products that are Linux-compatible. Given the dearth of computer makers seriously selling Linux
computers and the difficulty of building a modern Linux-compatible system,
I am concerned there never will be a serious mainstream proliferation of
the Linux OS.
