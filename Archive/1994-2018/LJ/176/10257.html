Yes, it runs Linux. Yes, you can hack it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0xda62a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Kindle has been out for a year now, and Amazon has had plenty of time
to work out any kinks in the software and hardware. It should
be a rock-solid device, right? I decided to find out. After spending some
quality time with the Kindle, I now can say the answer is mixed. 
Some things work great on the Kindle, but other
things just don't, and some of those things probably never will work
right (until Kindle 2.0, that is).
</p><p>
The good news is that the Kindle is readily available. Early on, it was perpetually out of stock on Amazon's Web site. Some critics
claimed the shortages were self-inflicted, and Amazon claimed demand
was simply &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo;. Whatever the reasons were, they have been
overcome. You want one delivered tomorrow? Done.
</p><p>
The Kindle comes in a very attractive package that resembles a
book. Inside the box, you get a USB cable, a power brick, a manual,
a handsome carrying case and the Kindle itself.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f1.large.jpg"><img src="10257f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Kindle comes with everything you see here.
</p></div></div><p>
After performing my solemn duty as a man and a geek of throwing away the
manual, it was time to get the Kindle up and running. The first order of
business was to plug it in and charge it up, and then, get some
content on it. Thankfully, charging takes only a couple hours, and you
can use the Kindle while it's charging.
</p><p>
Connecting the Kindle to your computer is as easy as connecting any other
modern electronic device via a standard USB cable. The Kindle shows up
as a removable device, like most cameras and thumbdrives. If you have
an SD card plugged in to the SD card slot, it also shows up.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f2.large.jpg"><img src="10257f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This screen appears on the Kindle while USB is plugged in.
</p></div></div><p>
First and foremost, the Kindle is defined by its screen. The E Ink
display immediately sets it apart from LCD and CRT displays. The best
word to describe it is steady. I can stare at it for hours without my
eyes growing tired like they do with LCD displays. Yes, it is only
black and white with a few levels of gray, but for something designed for
reading, it is ideal, or nearly so. The current generation of electronic
pager displays isn't perfect&mdash;the blacks aren't truly black, and the
whites are more of a light gray&mdash;but it's pretty close.
</p><p>
The Kindle is powered by a PXA255 XScale processor and has 256MB
of internal Flash memory (with 180MB available for books and other
content). Under the back cover of the Kindle is an SD card slot, the
reset hole and the battery.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f3.large.jpg"><img src="10257f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Ports on the Bottom of the Kindle
</p></div></div><p>
Navigation on the Kindle is handled by the Prev Page, Next Page and
Back buttons along either side of the Kindle and by a clever scroll
wheel, which functions as the Kindle's mouse replacement.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f4.large.jpg"><img src="10257f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Kindle is small and light.
</p></div></div><p>
The keyboard on the Kindle is cramped. The keys are too small, and they
require too much force when pressing them. It works though, and the typing needed is
minimal, so I can live with it.
</p><p>
All documents on the Kindle behave more or less the same. There's no
scrolling; instead, you page through the text. You can change the font size
and use the scroll wheel to look up words in the built-in dictionary or
follow links to other places in the document. You can bookmark a page by
moving the scroll cursor to the top of its track and virtually folding
down the top-right corner of the page. You also can add notes to the text
and highlight passages by drawing boxes around them.

The Kindle's Features</h2></div></div><p>
One of the earliest complaints leveled against the Kindle was that it is
tied to Amazon.com and its storefront. Along those lines, the two most
common fears were &ldquo;If my Kindle loses its memory, will I lose all
my books and have to buy them again?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is Amazon my only source for
content?&rdquo; The answer to both of those questions is no.
</p><p>
Amazon keeps a record of all of your
purchases and lets you re-download them at any time. You also can back up
your Kindle files on your computer.
The Kindle is well integrated
into Amazon's bookstore, but it is not tied to it. Several
eBookstores have eBooks for free download or purchase,
including ManyBooks.net, WebScription, Mobipocket.com and many
others (see Resources).
</p><p>
Mobipocket is the originator of the Mobipocket eBook format. It
was purchased by Amazon in 2005, so it's not surprising that the default
format for Kindle eBooks is Mobipocket. Amazon adds DRM, unfortunately,
to the otherwise Mobipocket-formatted eBooks it sells through Amazon.com
and the built-in-to-the-Kindle bookstore. True to the real intent of
DRM, this does little to stop piracy and everything to punish and annoy
honest citizens. But, and this is a big one, the Kindle reads unencrypted
Mobipocket files just fine. All of the sites listed above offer books in
Mobipocket and other formats. My favorite of the bunch is ManyBooks.net,
because it specializes in public domain books&mdash;meaning the books
available for download on its site are not only free, they're also free
(if you know what I mean).
</p><p>
One of the Kindle's neatest features is its wireless
capabilities. The Kindle cannot connect to your Wi-Fi network, but it
doesn't need to. Instead, it uses a built-in EVDO modem to connect to what
Amazon calls its Whisper Net, but in reality, it's just Sprint's
CDMA network. There is no charge for using this network, even for Web
browsing. Instead, the costs are rolled in to the price of the Kindle
itself, and the books, magazines and services you buy from Amazon.
</p><p>
Actually, I shouldn't include &ldquo;services&rdquo; in the above list, because right now, the only service Amazon charges for
is its document-conversion service. You can e-mail Word, HTML
or image documents to &lt;yourname@kindle.com&gt;, and they are converted
and sent directly to your Kindle for $0.10 each. There's also a free
version where you can e-mail documents to &lt;yourname@free.kindle.com&gt;, and
you'll get a link to the converted document sent back to you (getting it
onto your Kindle is your responsibility). The yourname part of the e-mail
can be set and changed at Amazon.com in the Manage Your Kindle section.
</p><p>
I tested the conversion functionality with several documents, and I tried
both the no-cost and regular services. There wasn't any difference in
the time it took to convert the documents. The only difference was that one
was sent to my Kindle automatically and the other arrived in my e-mail
and had to be transferred manually to my Kindle.
</p><p>
My first test involved sending some .pdf files for conversion. The
text converted fine, but I lost the graphics, some of the formatting,
internal links and the .pdf's table of contents. I can't be too upset
about what failed though, as .pdf isn't an officially supported file
format. With all the PDF documents I have, it's nice that it works, even
with some limitations.
</p><p>
I also tried sending over .gif, .jpg, .odt, .ods, .doc, .xls, .rtf
and .html documents. The .html, .rtf, .gif, .jpg and .doc documents
came through fine, but the translation service did not recognize the
OpenDocument or Excel documents.
</p><p>
By default, this service converts and sends to your Kindle only documents
sent from your primary e-mail address as configured at Amazon.com. You
can add additional e-mail addresses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0xda7590"></a>
The Kindle Is Open to
Experimentation</h2></div></div><p>
The Kindle's main menu has an Experimental item on it. This submenu
has three choices: Basic Web, Ask Kindle NowNow and Play Music.
</p><p>
Basic Web is what it claims to be&mdash;a basic Web browser. It has two viewing
modes: Default and Advanced. Default strips out most formatting and just
provides the content of the page you're viewing. Advanced mode tries
to render some of the page's layout.
</p><p>
Ask Kindle NowNow is a human-powered search service from Amazon. You
can ask a question and submit it, and then real people will research
it on-line and send up to three responses
to your Kindle. The service is free for now, but I can't imagine it
will remain free indefinitely. To test it, I sent the question: &ldquo;When
will the successor to the Kindle be announced?&rdquo; 
About 30 minutes later, I had three answers on my Kindle and in my
e-mail inbox. They were all along the lines of &ldquo;not this year&rdquo;. The first
one was the best; it was well researched and included statements from
Amazon on the subject. The other two were short and not as informative,
but still good. The responses also included links. Clicking on the links opens
up the Kindle Web browser to the page in question&mdash;rather handy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f6.large.jpg"><img src="10257f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Ask Kindle NowNow any question, and people will try to answer it.
</p></div></div><p>
Playing music on the kindle works for MP3 files. No other formats
work. There's also no playlist support and no user interface apart from
the Play button on the Experimental page. There are two undocumented
keyboard shortcuts you can use: Alt-F to skip to the next song and Alt-P
to Play/Pause the music. It's not the most useful of music players,
but it does play music.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0xda7a08"></a>
The Kindle's Openness</h2></div></div><p>
Because the Kindle runs on Linux, you can download the source code to
the Kindle from Amazon's Web site. Several bits of the code, like the
GUI layer, are not available.
</p><p>
The source code tar file weighs in at 72.4MB. When untarred,
you are left with a gplresults directory. Inside this directory are
the following tar.bz2 files:
alsa-lib-1.0.6.tar.bz2, alsa-utils-1.0.6.tar.bz2, binutils-2.16.1.tar.bz2,
bsdiff-4.3.tar.bz2, busybox-1.01.tar.bz2, bzip2-1.0.3.tar.bz2,
dosfstools-2.11.tar.bz2, e2fsprogs-1.38.tar.bz2, freetype-2.1.10.tar.bz2,
gcc-3.4.2.tar.bz2, jpeg-6b.tar.bz2, libpng-1.2.8.tar.bz2,
linux-2.6.10-lab126.tar.bz2, module-init-tools-3.1.tar.bz2,
ncurses-5.4.tar.bz2, ppp-2.4.4b1.tar.bz2, procps-3.2.7.tar.bz2,
taglib-1.4.tar.bz2, u-boot-1.1.2.tar.bz2, uClibc-0.9.27.tar.bz2,
util-linux-2.12.tar.bz2 and zlib-1.2.3.tar.bz2.
</p><p>
We can deduce several things from this list: the
Kindle boots with Das U-Boot, it uses FreeType for fonts, ALSA for audio,
and it is using a Linux 2.6.10 kernel.
I'm not a programmer, so I didn't delve into the code to see what was
changed, reworked or added.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0xda7c18"></a>
Hacking the Kindle</h2></div></div><p>
One of the more interesting pieces of code on the
Kindle is BusyBox. Its
presence suggests there is support for a command-line interface of some
sort. It turns out there is, but it's not easy to access.
</p><p>
If you take the back cover off the Kindle, there is a little covered
access port next to the battery. This access port can be removed with
a small flat-head screwdriver. Under the cover is a small
ribbon connector port, which functions as a console port. See Resources for
links to the
full details of the hack.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f7.large.jpg"><img src="10257f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The console port on the back of the Kindle is small.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0x11a01d8"></a>
Exposing the Kindle's Secrets</h2></div></div><p>
Thanks to the intrepid hacker who hacked into the Kindle through the
console port, several hidden features of the Kindle have been brought
to light.
</p><p>
First, there is a basic picture viewer built in to the Kindle. To
enable it, you need to create a folder on the Kindle called pictures
or dcim. In that folder, you can organize your photos into subfolders. Press
Alt-Shift-Z while in the main menu of the Kindle, and each folder will
appear as a separate &ldquo;book&rdquo; on the last page of the list of books.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f8.large.jpg"><img src="10257f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The options for the picture viewer app are few.
</p></div></div><p>
While viewing pictures, you can use the menu to enable and disable
dithering and shrink to fit. You also can view photos in full-screen
mode. While looking at your pictures, you can press Alt-Shift-0 to set
the current picture as the picture for the Kindle screensaver. You also can
press F to toggle full-screen mode.
</p><p>
A picture viewer isn't the only hidden application. There also is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Minesweeper</em></span> game. You can launch it from the Kindle home screen by
pressing Alt-Shift-M. From the menu, you can select different grid sizes
from 4x5 to 8x10 to 14x14. Unfortunately, the novelty of having
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Minesweeper</em></span>
on the Kindle wears off as soon as you start playing. The Kindle's E Ink display
just isn't suited to quick changes to the screen. Moving
the cursor in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Minesweeper</em></span> is an exercise in patience: you press L,
wait a few seconds, and with any luck, the cursor moves one space to the
left. The slowness of the gameplay is probably why Amazon never provided
a proper link to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Minesweeper</em></span> in the interface. I'm
glad Amazon didn't take
it out though, as it shows the Kindle is at least marginally capable of running
a wide variety of software.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10257f9.large.jpg"><img src="10257f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You can play <span  class="emphasis"><em>Minesweeper</em></span>, if you have the patience for it.
</p></div></div><p>
The Browser has a few neat keyboard shortcuts, including links
to Google Maps to show your current location (Alt-1), nearby gas stations
(Alt-2), nearby restaurants (Alt-3) and nearby hotels (Alt-4). When you
press Alt-5, a little box pops up asking &ldquo;Are you looking for something
nearby?&rdquo;, and you enter what you're looking for, and it searches for
it. Well, it would, if any of these shortcuts worked. Instead of working,
the Kindle just goes to Google Maps and puts &ldquo;Not Avail,Not
Avail&rdquo; into
the location box. Either it just doesn't work in my area, or there is
some switch waiting to be thrown at Amazon or Sprint to enable it.
</p><p>
Finally, there are several global shortcuts that come in handy. The first
is Alt-Shift-R, which reboots the Kindle. Next is Alt-Shift-., which
restarts only the Kindle GUI. This last one is the most useful, for me
anyway&mdash;Alt-Shift-G is a global screenshot shortcut.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0x11a0ac8"></a>
Some Annoyances</h2></div></div><p>
The Kindle is underpowered, especially with larger books or when it's busy indexing or doing some other background task.
</p><p>
Next, the Kindle crashed a few times during my testing. Granted, I was
running several apps that don't officially exist, but I don't feel I
should have had to use the reset button as often as I did. Amazon still
has some work to do there.
</p><p>
The Mobipocket format is another annoyance. It is an old binary format
from the days when the Palm was known as the Pilot. It's not a very well
documented format, and all of the tools for converting documents to it
are proprietary and Windows-only.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcae580.0x11a0c80"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The big question regarding the Kindle is whether it is actually worth
$350. My thought is it is, <span   class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> you read <span   class="emphasis"><em>a
lot</em></span>.
</p><p>
And, I do. I carry around lots of books and printouts and miscellaneous
scraps of paper&mdash;some for enjoyment and many for my job. I used to try
reading things on my computer, but found my eyes quickly tired, so I
switched to printing out longer articles and documentation I wanted
to read. Apart from being environmentally wasteful, all that loose,
printed material has to be organized or it grows into a big mess.
</p><p>
The Kindle has eliminated a lot of the mess. Now, when I head back to the
server room, the only thing I need to carry is the Kindle&mdash;no stacks
of notes and no reams of product documentation. It's all in the Kindle,
along with a new novel to read while waiting for the server to finish
its install. And, my desk is cleaner than any time in recent memory.
</p><p>
Is it worth $350? For me? Yes.
