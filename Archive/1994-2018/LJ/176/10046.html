Use Puppet for configuration management.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd0250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you have more than one UNIX box in your care, you know
how duplication happens. Every machine needs a common set of
settings. Package upgrades need to be deployed. Certain packages need
to be on every server.
</p><p>
You also want to make sure that any changes to your systems happen in
a controlled manner. It's one thing to start off with two servers that
are similarly configured; it's another thing to know they're the same
a year later, especially if other people are involved.
</p><p>
Puppet is a system for automating system administration tasks (in the
author's own words). In the Puppet world, you define a policy (called a
manifest) that describes the end state of your systems, and the Puppet
software takes care of making sure the system meets that end state. If a
file changes, it is replaced with a pristine copy. If a required package
is removed, it is re-installed.
</p><p>
It is important to draw a distinction between shell scripts that copy
files between systems and a tool like Puppet. The latter abstracts the
policy from the steps required to make a system conform. Puppet is smart
enough to use apt-get to install a package on a Debian system and yum
on a Fedora system. Puppet is smart enough to do nothing if the system
already is conformant to the policy.
</p><p>
The Puppet system is split into two parts: a central server and the
clients. The server runs a d&aelig;mon called puppetmaster. The clients run
puppetd, which both connects to, and receives connections from, the
puppetmaster. The manifest is written on the puppetmaster. If Puppet is
used to manage the central server, it also runs the puppetd client.
</p><p>
The best way to begin with a configuration management system like
Puppet is to start with a single client and a simple policy, and then
roll it out to more clients and a more complex policy. To that end,
start off by installing the Puppet software. Puppet is written in the
Ruby scripting language, so you need to install that before you begin
(Ruby is available as a package for most distributions).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd0618"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Packages Are Good</b></p><p>
Some people scoff at the idea of using a prebuilt binary package and
prefer to build everything from source. That'll work, but it just
doesn't scale. When you get further along with Puppet, you'll see how
your manifest can manage packages with a single line. It's certainly
possible to specify all the files you built, but then you're putting in
a lot of needless effort.
</p><p>
You can (and should) build your own packages where needed. Packaging
your own applications means you will build the software consistently,
version after version, so that files will be in the same place and you
won't accidentally drop features. Building your own packages also handles
dependencies against other packages and keeps track of software versions.
</p><p>
In all likelihood, you will end up with your own package repository
that holds your locally developed packages and any vendor packages that
you've modified. You also will use Puppet to ensure that your clients are
pointed at your repository.
</p><p>
Installing Puppet from a package also lets you manage the client's
Puppet software through Puppet itself. Need to upgrade in order to get
more features? Simply update your manifest. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd0930"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
If you choose to install from source, you need the facter and puppet
tarballs from the author's site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
http://reductivelabs.com/downloads/facter/facter-latest.tgz
</p></li><li><p>
http://reductivelabs.com/downloads/puppet/puppet-latest.tgz
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The facter tarball contains the Facter utility, which generates facts
about the host system. Facts can be anything from the Linux distribution
to whether the host is a virtual machine. The puppet
tarball contains both puppetd and puppetmaster.
</p><p>
Untar the files (<tt  >tar -xzf facter-latest.tgz</tt> and
<tt  >tar -xzf puppet-latest.tgz</tt>).
Change to the newly created facter directory, and run <tt  >ruby
install.rb</tt> as
root. You will do the same for the puppet directory, which installs
both the client and server packages.
</p><p>
Then, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
puppetmasterd --mkusers; chown puppet /var/puppet 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd0e58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
on the puppetmaster to
create the puppet user (which also creates the initial directory structure
and then fixes a permissions problem). You can skip this step if you
are installing from packages.
</p><p>
On the client, run:



<pre     class="programlisting">
puppetd --mkusers; puppetd --server puppet.example.com --test
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd1068"></a></h2></div></div><p>
substituting the name of your puppetmaster
for puppet.example.com, which creates the user and directory structure on
the client, and then begin the SSL key exchange between the client and
the server. You will get an error about certificate validation, because
the certificates are not trusted yet.
</p><p>
Back on the puppetmaster, run <tt  >puppetca --list</tt> to show the outstanding
certificate requests. You then can use <tt  >puppetca
--sign</tt> to accept the
certificate, as shown below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[root@test1 etc]# puppetca --list
test2.ertw.com
[root@test1 etc]# puppetca --sign test2.ertw.com
Signed test2.ertw.com
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, the client and server have a mutually trusted connection. The
next step is to define the manifest. For this article, I'm using the network
time protocol (NTP) d&aelig;mon as an example. The goal is to define a
manifest that ensures the d&aelig;mon is installed, configured and in the boot
sequence.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd1328"></a>
Defining the Manifest</h2></div></div><p>
In Puppet terms, a resource is something being managed and the attributes
that define it. A resource might be a file that has permission attributes
or a package with a name and a version. Puppet comes bundled with many
resource types; you also can create your own or download those that
others have made.
</p><p>
The central manifest is defined in /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp. Start
with a simple resource defining the NTP package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package { 
    ntp:
        ensure =&gt; installed
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The above defines a package resource called ntp with one
attribute called ensure. The ensure attribute defines the state
of the package, with values such as installed, absent, latest
or even a version number.
</p><p>
Puppetmaster will notice the change in site.pp and reload the
manifest. The client will check in only every half-hour, so you can
restart puppetd or send the process the SIGUSR1 signal to force the
client to check back with the server immediately. If all goes well,
your client will read the manifest and install the ntp package. Try
removing the package, and it will be replaced within 30 minutes.
If not, check your logs (usually /var/log/messages) for any errors,
and make sure your site.pp is correct.
</p><p>
NTP also requires a configuration file called /etc/ntp.conf. Puppet has a
resource type called file that handles files. The puppetmaster will hold the
master ntp.conf and copy it to the clients should they change their copies.
</p><p>
Create a directory in /var/puppet called files. Then, create
/etc/puppet/fileserver.conf as shown below, and restart puppetmasterd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[files]
    path /var/puppet/files
    allow *
</pre>
</p><p>
fileserver.conf defines file shares for the internal Puppet file server. The
above example implements a share called files, which corresponds to a
directory on the puppetmaster called /var/puppet/files. Use a URL like 
puppet://puppet.example.com/files/etc/ntp.conf to access a file located
at /var/puppet/files/etc/ntp.conf on the puppetmaster. The <tt  >allow
*</tt> grants
access to all puppet clients.
</p><p>
Put a working ntp.conf in /var/puppet/files/etc/, and then add the
following to your existing site.pp:



<pre     class="programlisting">
file {
    "ntp.conf":
        mode =&gt; 644,
        owner =&gt; root,
        group =&gt; root,
        path =&gt; "/etc/ntp.conf",
        source =&gt; "puppet://puppet.example.com/files/etc/ntp.conf"
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The format of this file resource is much like the package you previously
set up. The resource has a tag of ntp.conf (which is quoted because of the
period). The mode, owner and group attributes specify the file's
permissions. The path attribute is the local path, which, if omitted,
defaults to the value of the tag (the tag does not have a full path in
this case, however). Finally, the file's source is a puppet URI that
will be pulled from the puppetmaster.
</p><p>
Restart the puppet d&aelig;mon on the client (or wait 30 minutes), and you
will see ntp.conf has been updated. If you try to change it, you will
see that it is replaced in the next cycle.
</p><p>
The final resource needed is the service resource, whose job is to make
sure a d&aelig;mon is running and that the d&aelig;mon is in the startup scripts (or
not, if that's your desire). Add the following fragment to your site.pp:


<pre     class="programlisting">
service {
    ntpd:
        ensure =&gt; true,
        enable =&gt; true,
        subscribe =&gt; [ File["ntp.conf"], Package[ntp] ]
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The service resource handles the ntpd service. The ensure attribute makes
sure the d&aelig;mon is running, and the enable attribute makes sure it is part
of the startup script. The mechanics of this are handled by a provider, and each OS and distribution can have a different provider for each type
of service. On Red Hat and Fedora systems, the service provider uses the
chkconfig and service utilities.
</p><p>
The subscribe attribute brings the three resources together. The service
resource is subscribed to the ntp.conf file resource and the ntp package
resource. If any one of them change, the service resource is notified, which is
an indication that the service should be restarted. This means you can push out
changes by editing the master file on the puppetmaster, and on the next cycle,
the client will download the new configuration and restart the d&aelig;mon without
your intervention.
</p><p>
The subscribe attribute can take either a single element, such as
Package[ntp], or multiple elements written in array format, such as
[ element1, element2]. Also be careful to capitalize the reference,
as the lowercase version has been deprecated and will not work at some
point in the future.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bd1b10"></a>
Introducing Classes</h2></div></div><p>
Although powerful, these resource definitions can become unwieldy. Puppet
has ways around this too. Create a directory under manifests called
services, and create a file in this directory called ntpclient.pp
with the following contents:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class ntpclient {
    package {
        ntp:
            ensure =&gt; installed
    }

    file {
        "ntp.conf":
            mode =&gt; 644,
            owner =&gt; root,
            group =&gt; root,
            path =&gt; "/etc/ntp.conf",
            source =&gt; "puppet://puppet.example.com/files/etc/ntp.conf",
    }

    service {
        ntpd:
            ensure =&gt; true,
            enable =&gt; true,
            subscribe =&gt; [ File["ntp.conf"], Package [ntp] ],
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This new file contains the three resources you created earlier, surrounded
by a class definition. A class groups several resources, which simplifies
your configuration and promotes manifest sharing.
</p><p>
Now, replace your site.pp with this simplified manifest:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import "services/*"

include ntpclient
</pre>
</p><p>
The import line reads in all the files inside the services directory. The
include line evaluates the class, which means that the class will be
applied to the node. This configuration has the same effect as the one
before, except the NTP client functionality now has been bundled
into the class.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bc86b8"></a>
Getting Selective</h2></div></div><p>
So far, the manifest has assumed that all clients get the same
configuration. The easiest way to give different configurations to
different clients is with a node definition. A node definition applies
a series of configuration directives to a given set of nodes. Replace
your site.pp as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import "services/*"

node test2, test3 {
    include ntpclient
}

node default {

}
</pre>
</p><p>
With this policy in place, only test2 and test3 will have the ntp client
class applied. Any other client will be caught by the default statement,
which has no resources defined.
</p><p>
Facter is another way to differentiate hosts. Facter generates facts about
a machine, such as the operating system, hostname and processor. Simply
type <tt  >facter</tt> to see a list of the currently known facts. Here is a
subset of the facts generated on one of my test machines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
architecture =&gt; i386
domain =&gt; ertw.com
facterversion =&gt; 1.3.8
fqdn =&gt; test2.ertw.com
hardwareisa =&gt; i686
hardwaremodel =&gt; i686
hostname =&gt; test2
id =&gt; root
ipaddress =&gt; 192.168.1.143
ipaddress_eth0 =&gt; 192.168.1.143
kernel =&gt; Linux
kernelrelease =&gt; 2.6.18-8.el5xen
lsbdistcodename =&gt; Final
lsbdistdescription =&gt; CentOS release 5 (Final)
lsbdistid =&gt; CentOS
lsbdistrelease =&gt; 5
macaddress =&gt; 00:16:3E:5D:22:17
macaddress_eth0 =&gt; 00:16:3E:5D:22:17
memoryfree =&gt; 159.17 MB
memorysize =&gt; 256.17 MB
operatingsystem =&gt; CentOS
operatingsystemrelease =&gt; 2.6.18-8.el5xen
processor0 =&gt; Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1.80GHz
processorcount =&gt; 1
ps =&gt; ps -ef
puppetversion =&gt; 0.24.2
</pre>
</p><p>
Facts are exposed in the manifest as variables. The operatingsystem fact
is seen as $operatingsystem. A common use of this is to make the same
resource behave differently, depending on the operating system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
file { "foo" 
    name =&gt; $operatingsystem ? {
        solaris =&gt; "/usr/local/etc/foo.conf",
        default =&gt; "/etc/foo.conf"
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The above example uses a Puppet selector to set the name attribute instead
of a static string. A selector is much like a case statement in that it
can return different values depending on the input. This file resource
refers to /usr/local/etc/foo.conf on Solaris systems and /etc/foo.conf
on other systems. The system type is determined from the input to the
selector, which is the $operatingsystem Facter variable.
</p><p>
You can add your own facts by writing a Ruby script. See Resources
for links to documentation for adding custom facts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ad8580.0x1bc8ad8"></a>
Puppet vs. the Alternatives</h2></div></div><p>
My first experience with configuration management was with a product called
cfengine. With cfengine, I was able to manage a Web cluster of 14
servers easily and reduce the time to install a new node from several hours to
a matter of minutes. Puppet's author has a great deal of cfengine
experience and built Puppet to address many shortcomings of cfengine.
</p><p>
Given that cfengine has a much wider install base than Puppet,
why would one choose Puppet? After comparing the two, I've discovered
several reasons. First, Puppet has a much cleaner configuration than
cfengine. In the cfengine world, you are concerned with the ordering of
certain operations, whereas Puppet handles ordering with the subscribe
attribute (and some others).
</p><p>
Cfengine has many commands for adding and removing lines from files,
which don't exist natively in Puppet. Puppet addresses this by providing
native resource types for many of the systems that I found myself editing
by hand, such as mountpoints. Using a dedicated resource type means the
manifest is clear and simple.
</p><p>
Cfengine is open source, but it has a more closed community than Puppet. You
can extend cfengine through modules, much akin to Puppet's recipes and
facts, but it is nowhere near as integrated. Puppet seems designed
from the start to be extensible, where cfengine feels like an
afterthought. Puppet also promotes recipe sharing by making them
modular, where sharing cfengine code is more difficult because the
resources are in different parts of the cfengine policy.
</p><p>
Puppet is written in Ruby, and cfengine is written in C. Initially,
I thought this was an advantage for cfengine, but after getting into
Puppet, I realized it's not a big deal. Puppet's author takes great
pains to abstract Puppet's configuration from the Ruby language,
so no knowledge of Ruby is needed.
</p><p>
I found the learning curve for cfengine to be the steepest. Granted,
I had no understanding of configuration management when starting with
cfengine, and I had some cfengine experience by the time I started with Puppet,
but many of my stumbling blocks have been fixed in Puppet.
</p><p>
Both projects offer support over their IRC channels. Cfengine has an
extensive on-line manual and a fair bit of third-party documentation on
other Web sites. Puppet has an excellent wiki and a comparable amount
of third-party documentation.
</p><p>
Although Puppet is younger compared to cfengine, its openness
and extensibility are what make it a better choice than cfengine.
