    Training is a sound investment networked to future growth.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x25805b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I was recently talking with a close
friend who works as a systems software developer for a small
startup technology company. The architects are planning a
transition to Linux servers as their platform, but the company does
not want to provide Linux training for their staff. When I asked
why, he replied, &ldquo;It's too expensive.&rdquo; Even though the OS license
is free, the documentation is free, and the source code is free,
this company was overlooking an important factor: the costs of
inadequate training can far exceed the costs of educating staff.
</p><p>Networked systems in the workplace continue to grow and
expand. As an example, the current growth rate of the Internet is a
factor of two every eight months. Linux is considered by many to be
the most powerful and versatile network operating system to arrive
on the scene in recent years. Due to its power and flexibility, its
rate of deployment is also growing rapidly. More and more
organizations are turning to Linux as a low-cost, reliable and
increasingly supported network-computing platform for a variety of
business and Internet applications.</p><p>As businesses strive to keep up with this fast-paced network
development, their employees need to experience a parallel growth
in skills for optimum job performance. Unfortunately, it's common
for organizations to bring in training providers only after the
need becomes evident&mdash;almost as an afterthought. This makeshift
method of training prevents adequate planning for anticipated time
and financial investments. And &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;proactive&rdquo;
training programs are a sure-fire way to knock off any company's
competitive edge.</p><p>A Linux training solution that is designed to grow along with
an organization brings benefits that can permeate operations across
the board. Sufficient education ensures that senior administrators
are not overwhelmed with on-the-job training, encourages employees
to stay on for the long term, reduces the likelihood of emergencies
and strengthens employees' ability to deal with a crisis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x25807c0"></a>Reviewing the Basics of Linux Training</h2></div></div><p>Employees who can benefit from Linux training range from NT
administrators with little or no Linux command-line experience to
experienced UNIX systems administrators with a broad background in
heterogeneous environments.</p><p>When introducing or expanding the use of Linux into an
organization, the phases of deployment must be dovetailed with a
training plan. Clearly, the first training phase should be aimed at
decision makers and system administrators. Key administrators and
IT managers often attend training sessions together, working and
learning as a team. The next phase involves a pilot program, with
Linux installed in isolated situations. As the Linux system is
implemented throughout the organization, the scope of training
broadens to include system developers, content and media
professionals and other users. Finally, ongoing training is used to
refresh knowledge and ramp up employees new to their
organization.</p><p>Every Linux distribution is based on the GNU (open-source
software that functions as UNIX but is not UNIX) tools and shells,
and the installed systems are frequently referred to as GNU/Linux
platforms. Since the power and flexibility afforded by Linux begins
at the command line, the first level of training should begin with
the Bourne Again Shell (bash) along with GNU utilities. The second
level of training should address installation of a GNU/Linux
distribution, including the best techniques for planning and
executing the installation. The third training level should
instruct students in the configuration and maintenance of freely
distributed software services and daemons running under Linux,
along with security and lock-down practices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2580978"></a>Preparing for the Training Process</h2></div></div><p>During the training cycle, system administrators will be
unavailable for their regular duties. Larger organizations often
arrange for on-site delivery of the courses. On-site training,
where education providers bring the &ldquo;classroom&rdquo; directly to a
company location, can reduce expenses such as travel costs and also
reduce employees' training time obligations.</p><p>Providing sufficient operations support for available staff
is critical to a successful training plan. Whether courses are held
on or off site, students must be relieved of work responsibilities
(or on-call status). If a student remains in the classroom while
attempting to provide ad-hoc hotline support for an operational
crisis, it's a lose/lose situation. The student is unable to focus
sufficiently on both the training and the crisis support&mdash;the value
of training is lost, and the quality of support is marginal.
Students must mentally and physically detach to immerse themselves
in classroom experience to maximize the return on the educational
investment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2580ad8"></a>Reaping the Benefits of Linux Training</h2></div></div><p>The payback for instituting a well-planned instructor-led
Linux training program is both progressive and far-reaching. The
following are areas where an organization can expect to find
substantial benefits as a direct result of successful Linux
training.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2580be0"></a>Acquiring Linux Fluency</h2></div></div><p>The GNU/Linux culture is inherited from the various flavors
of UNIX. The evolution of Linux that occurred during the 1990s
mirrors that of UNIX during the 1970s and 80s. Due to the nature of
the GNU General Public License, the open-software culture and
peer-review process have created an evolution that provides
universal accessibility to computer professionals and power users
alike.</p><p>The legacy culture of Linux makes an understanding of the
roots of UNIX and the nature of free software critical. Gaining
Linux fluency allows new users and administrators to strengthen
their abilities to communicate with seasoned veterans of the Linux
environment. Learning about basic Linux resources, the structure of
a typical distribution, the wealth of contributed documentation
available and the philosophies of the system's design all work to
jump-start Linux fluency.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2580d40"></a>Easing the Way for Linux Administrators</h2></div></div><p>In larger organizations, senior administrators often provide
on-the-job training for their staff. But the senior administrators'
most critical role lies in planning for growth and evolution of the
network of systems for which they're responsible.</p><p>When Linux instruction is provided in a classroom setting,
students can dedicate time to intensive, hands-on training that
achieves a well-rounded knowledge base faster and more effectively.
Additional one-on-one training and mentoring&mdash;aimed specifically at
the needs of the organization's workplace&mdash;is a better investment
of senior administrators' time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2580ea0"></a>Learning That You Don't Know What You Don't
Know</h2></div></div><p>For both users and administrators, the scope of the tools and
facilities available under GNU/Linux systems is enormous. When
approached with &ldquo;how do I...&rdquo; questions, veteran administrators
often respond with &ldquo;Well, that depends.&rdquo; With a GNU/Linux-based
training solution, a wide arsenal of methods can be taught to solve
potential or actual problems in many different ways.</p><p>A holistic classroom approach, which includes lectures, labs
and a hands-on interactive learning environment, allows students to
be rapidly exposed to methods, tools and techniques they otherwise
may not discover for months. It is not uncommon to hear a student
exclaim, &ldquo;I never really understood how that worked!&rdquo; or &ldquo;What I
just learned in that last session alone made it worth being here
this week!&rdquo;</p><p>The instructor-led setting allows students to pose questions
and explore many aspects of conventional approaches to Linux-based
solutions. Students interact with one another and discover how
others have addressed similar configuration and maintenance issues
in the past. This &ldquo;shared&rdquo; learning environment enables students
to benefit from the experiences and discoveries of fellow learners
and instructors.</p><p>Linux training programs should provide each student with
access to a Linux system during hands-on labs. The labs speed the
process from learning the basics to putting the knowledge to work,
and support different learning styles among the students.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x25810b0"></a>Managing Employee Retention and Growth</h2></div></div><p>To avoid being overwhelmed by the rapid growth in today's
networking systems, Linux users and administrators need to receive
training that enables them to stay ahead of the curve. The
combination of accelerated technologies and inadequate training is
a setup for failure; staff members become frustrated and often
begin to look at new opportunities for professional growth.</p><p>Furthermore, training is often perceived by employees to be a
reward or a job perk. By providing a proactive training and
development program, employers demonstrate that they value their
employees and both parties feel there is something at stake in the
continued employee-employer relationship.</p><p>Regarding training, there is a paradox that some
organizations are afraid of: if they offer top-notch training,
employees may eventually take their enhanced skills elsewhere. In
fact, employees are far more likely to remain in an environment
where they can grow their skills and develop their careers. Since
employee recruitment has become so competitive, many employers seek
opportunities to train and promote from within. Employees have
ample prospects for advancement, while employers fill staffing
needs without paying relocation fees, signing bonuses and other
recruitment expenses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2581268"></a>Achieving Diversity through
Cross-Training</h2></div></div><p>Providing cross-training for employees who maintain a
specific job focus reduces operation risks by enabling staff
members to deploy contingency plans smoothly and rapidly. For
example, an administrator who maintains an NT or Novell server can
be cross-trained in Linux. When the inevitable human resources
crunch occurs, the workload can be easily redistributed. If a staff
member is out for a work emergency or due to a personal crisis,
another can step in and help fill the role. Diagnosing a problem
over a long-distance connection to someone who doesn't know the
first thing about the bash interactive shell can be a frustrating
experience at best and can lead to potentially greater catastrophes
than the initial problem.</p><p>Distributing knowledge and skills to employees through
cross-training also provides staff with a better understanding of
multiple problem and solution domains available in their networked
computing environment. By providing cross training of Linux skills
to staff members who are responsible for other systems (such as NT
or Novell), the collective of knowledge can assure the very best
overall practices are employed. By the same token, appropriate NT
systems training for staff members who are primarily focused on
Linux will lend them understanding of how best to leverage the
strengths and weaknesses of each operating system
environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x25813c8"></a>Increasing System Security and Reducing
Risks</h2></div></div><p>In today's high-speed networked computing environment, both
inadvertent damage and malicious attacks can cripple a system in
the blink of an eye. Damage recovery is a painfully slow and
meticulous process. Data is almost never completely restored, and
the time devoted to system recovery has net-zero
productivity.</p><p>With proper training and planning, however, preventive
measures can be taken to avoid risks and speed recovery in event of
a breach. Knowledge of how best to protect the system through
management of permissions and system services allows the
administrator to maintain tight system control, while determining
allowable access. Initial planning for system installation will
accommodate the most-favored backup strategies within the
organization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2488580.0x2581528"></a>Considering the Costs of Inadequate
Training</h2></div></div><p>The costs associated with Linux-based training are easily
determined. It's far more difficult to ascertain the tangible and
intangible costs of not investing in training. The backlash of not
instituting an educational program can include reduced staff
productivity and the loss of potential employee innovation and
creativity. And the company's customers are another critical
factor; clients depend on a networking organization for high-end
technical knowledge and service. It just takes one slip to lose
credibility, and perhaps business as well.</p><p>Finally, lack of adequate training could pave the way to
security risks. Linux has become a big player on-line, and its
growing popularity has led to an ever-expanding threat of potential
damage from hackers. With sufficient knowledge of the Linux
operating system, employees know which features or unused services
to disable to ensure site protection.</p><p>The costs of inadequate training can be either obvious or
subtle, but they trickle down through most phases of operations.
Solid training allows a diverse staff to play from the same sheet
of music, and the advantages are equal for both direct employees
and paid consultants. In the final analysis, providing an ongoing
education program for employees is the most important networking an
organization can do.</p></div></div>
