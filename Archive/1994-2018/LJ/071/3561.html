your beginner's book on SQL or Oracle. If you want a beginner's
book, get the third edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Practical SQL
Handbook</em></span> by Judith Bowman, et al. (Addison Wesley,
1998). This is also not an introduction to Oracle database
administration. It is a handbook to have nearby if you are an
Oracle database administrator (DBA) or are about to become one.
Given the release of Oracle8 (covered by this book) for Linux, you
may be in danger of the latter. The authors assume you already know
more or less what you want to do, and they have made it easy to
look up exactly how to do it. They are both Oracle DBAs of long
standing, and both are active in Oracle user groups. The authors
clearly write from experience.</p><p>The book is divided into two sections: the first, DBA Tasks;
the second, a reference work for DBAs.</p><p>The first part's organization somewhat reflects the life of a
database. In their introduction, the authors cover some theoretical
ground, which you will find useful. The introduction ends with
configuration planning. This section is one you probably won't need
very often, but if you are ever in the position of setting up a new
database or porting one to a new server, you should read this
chapter. There is much good advice on a task you don't do often,
but which is essential to making the database work correctly within
your budget. The book then covers installation and performance
tuning. Again, these two chapters cover things you don't do often,
but which are important. Performance tuning is not the same as
query optimization, covered in a later chapter.</p><p>Following this is a chapter on backups, essential for data
integrity. The authors discuss the various types of backups one can
do with Oracle or the underlying operating system, their advantages
and disadvantages. Step-by-step procedures for several different
types of backups and restorations are then given. As the authors
say in the chapter, &ldquo;The time to plan for recovery is before you
need to recover data.&rdquo; The authors recommend you walk through
several of the backup/restoration procedures to practice and test
the ones you will use.</p><p>Next are chapters on networking and security. The final
chapter covers a number of Oracle tools and has a tantalizingly
short section on how to find the many third-party tools for Oracle.
Much of the rest of the book consists of reference pages for
commands the Oracle DBA will find useful.</p><p>When you need more information on Oracle and Oracle
administration, refer to the appendix, &ldquo;Resources for the DBA&rdquo;.
This covers books, magazines, organizations (and their web sites),
newsgroups and list servers. It is an excellent starting point, and
in typical WWW fashion, will head you onward from resource to
resource.</p><p>Finally, the index includes entries for the various
Oracle-specific SQL commands and parameters. At a minimum, the
index will be very useful for reverse-engineering some of those
cryptic SQL statements that inadvertently get left around any
database shop.</p><p>The language in the book is terse and concise, almost
laconic, and very much to the point. On any question, the authors
provide rules of thumb or points to consider, but leave the final
decision up to the reader. Recommendations are also sprinkled
throughout the first part of the book. The authors explain their
recommendation, which means the reader learns the &ldquo;why&rdquo; as well
as learning a good practice.</p><p>The first edition was printed in April 1999. By June, four
errata were posted on the web page, and a second, corrected
printing was due by the end of that month. Clearly, O'Reilly takes
the professionalism and accuracy of their books seriously.
O'Reilly's web site is one of the best around. Looking at a web
page for a book is never as good as holding the dead trees in your
hands in a bookstore, but O'Reilly's web site comes close. If you
are not sure whether this book is for you, check out its entry at
the web site. If you are an Oracle DBA or are about to become one,
I highly recommend it.</p></div></div>
