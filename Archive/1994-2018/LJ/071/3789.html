    If you have an RS6000, you could be running Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdf500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Several months ago, IBM announced it
would support Linux on IBM PowerPC hardware. Since then, IBM has
given their sanction to a specific distribution of Linux for the
IBM PowerPC-based RS/6000 platforms. To round things out, IBM has
also made progress on arranging commercial-grade Linux software
support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdf608"></a>Supported Machines</h2></div></div><p>IBM's announcement of Linux support actually bridges two
product lines: the Intel-based and PowerPC-based platforms. The
Intel-based product line includes systems such as Netfinity,
IntelliStations, Thinkpads and the PC300 series. Information on
compatibility of Netfinity systems with Linux is available at the
Key Labs web site.</p><p>Linux distributions supporting the Intel-based product line
include Red Hat, Caldera, TurboLinux and SuSE. IBM has established
a marketing and support alliance with each of these vendors. For
example through these vendors, there is now a Linux release of
IBM's DB2 Database. Things change so quickly, one should check with
each of these Linux vendors to verify their current offerings.
Running Linux on Intel machines is quite common, so I will not say
more about Linux on the Netfinity platform.</p><p>The RS/6000 product line contains Power, Power2, Power3 and
PowerPC architectures. Each of these architectures contains several
different classes of machine capability. Within the RS/6000 product
line, official Linux support is limited to just a few CHRP PowerPC
architecture systems. At the time of this writing, the supported
systems include RS/6000 Models 7046-B50, 7043-150 and 7025-F50.
There are plans to add support for the model 7043-260. The F50 and
260 are multiprocessor machines.</p><p>If you are going to purchase one of the supported systems to
run Linux, make sure optional components being purchased also
support Linux. I've seen one posting by a 7043-150 owner having
problems installing Linux. It turns out several different graphic
cards can be purchased with the 150s. Only three models of the
graphic cards were supported&mdash;guess which one wasn't in the
machine. This is one area that must be verified prior to purchasing
your supported RS/6000.</p><p>Those investing in the supported PowerPCs should have access
to detailed information on the specific hardware configurations
that were used to determine that Linux can be installed and runs
properly. The IBM PowerPCs need a site like the one Key Labs has
for compatibility of Netfinity products and Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdf870"></a>Sanctioned Linux Distribution</h2></div></div><p>Terra Soft Solutions, Inc. produces the Yellow Dog Linux
(YDL) distribution. This distribution is the official
IBM-sanctioned distribution for the supported PowerPC RS/6000
platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdf978"></a>YDL Installation Guide</h2></div></div><p>The YDL Installation Guide is well-written and laid out.
Unfortunately, the install guide that came with my copy of the
media is heavily written and illustrated for the Macintosh hardware
and install processes. YDL made a couple of change pages available.
These pages primarily added single-sentence references to the model
numbers of the supported RS/6000 platforms. Included was one page
on installing YDL on an RS/6000. There are six pages with
illustrations discussing preparing the Macintosh for Linux
installation. Hopefully, the RS/6000s will receive a little more
print in the next release of the guide.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdfa80"></a>Sources of Support</h2></div></div><p>For supported RS/6000 systems, Terra Soft Solutions, Inc.
offers installation support for a reasonable fee. I would recommend
purchasing the installation support if you are installing YDL on a
supported RS/6000. The additional cost for this support is nothing
when compared to the cost of a supported RS/6000. Terra Soft
considers installation support to be at an end once the product has
been installed. According to the installation support description,
installation is complete once root access has been obtained.</p><p>An agreement has been established with Linuxcare, Inc. to
provide post-installation support services and training for the
RS/6000 and Yellow Dog Linux. Linuxcare offers four levels of
on-call support. Prepackaged support levels have been grouped into
Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum levels of support. There are
options for obtaining customized levels of support, including
24-hour, 7-day-a-week support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdfbe0"></a>Other IBM PowerPCs</h2></div></div><p>Proud owners of older IBM PReP PowerPC machines may also be
able to use a PowerPC Linux distribution. Yellow Dog Linux is
heavily oriented toward the CHRP machines. Nevertheless, their web
site indicates the official YDL distribution has been successfully
installed on the following non-supported IBM models: the 830 and
850, the 860, the 40P, the Nobis and INDI platforms. I understand
the Nobis and INDI are Italian machines. Several Motorola systems
were also listed as working, but not officially supported for this
distribution. Most of these PReP machines have not been sold for
several years. It looks as if they are beginning to enter the
secondary and hobbyist market.</p><p>The 830/850 machines came from the PC side of IBM. The 850's
proper name is IBM Personal Computer Power Series 850. It is
catalogued as Personal Computer Model 6070 and comes with either a
100MHz, 120MHz or 133MHz CPU. This IDE-based PReP PowerPC system is
not a member of the RS/6000 product line, nor is it a member of the
RS/6000 43P family of machines. While some folks have gotten a
release of Linux running on this machine, getting Linux installed
on this IDE-based machine can be a major, and very frustrating,
challenge.</p><p>Another machine from this PReP era is the Thinkpad Power
Series 850 (also known as a Model 7249-850). The RS/6000 Notebook
860 (Model 7249-860) replaced the ThinkPad 850. I have seen a few
mailing list postings indicating some folks have their ThinkPad 850
and Notebook 860 running Linux. These SCSI-bus PReP machines seem
to have had a little better luck running PowerPC Linux than the
IDE-based machines.</p><p>The 40P is another system that is about the same vintage as
the PC Power Series machines. The 40P is another desktop PReP
SCSI-2-based PowerPC system. This unit is categorized as an RS/6000
platform and is formally known as a Model 7020-40P. This machine
type is listed as having had Linux successfully installed. While
listed, the install process is not at all smooth and does have its
difficulties.</p><p>The RS/6000 Model 7248 is another IBM PReP PowerPC platform.
On the surface, there appear to be several similarities between the
7248 and the PC Power Series 850. Don't let these similarities fool
you; there are differences between the two machines. The 7248
machines came from the RS/6000 side of IBM. The model 7248 was the
first generation of 43Ps. These came with either a 100MHz, 120MHz
or 133MHz CPU. This SCSI-2-based system was replaced with the
current CHRP model 7043 version of the 43P. I've seen a couple of
postings indicating success with installing and running PowerPC
Linux on the model 7248 versions of the 43P.</p><p>I recommend caution if you plan to install YDL on a PReP
machine. After several hours of trying, I still could not get my
IDE-base PReP machine to recognize the YDL floppy boot files. I
switched to another distribution and didn't have any better luck.
The SCSI-based PReP machines seem to have an install success rate
better than the IDE-based ones. Vendors such as LinuxPPC, Inc.,
Debian, TurboLinux and others offer their own versions of PowerPC
Linux. One of these distributions may play better with your PReP
machine. You will have to experiment to find out which one is best
for you. Hopefully, PowerPC Linux support for these IBM PReP
PowerPCs will expand as more of these older IBM machines come into
the hands of the Linux-capable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdfea0"></a>Do Your Homework</h2></div></div><p>If you are going to venture into installing Linux on a PReP
IBM PowerPC, spend some time reviewing both the current and
archived mailing lists for Yellow Dog and LinuxPPC. Let people on
the list know what you are planning. Be specific about which Linux
distribution you plan to use and the model of your PowerPC. They
can help you avoid some blind alleys and dead-end avenues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfdffa8"></a>Proper System Firmware</h2></div></div><p>Not having the proper firmware installed on your PReP machine
could affect your installation of Linux. It may not be important to
some, yet most of these PReP machines require a specific firmware
release to be Year 2000 ready. IBM maintains a Year 2000 web site
where you can verify whether a different firmware release is
required for your system. Caution: use only firmware designated for
your machine&mdash;doing otherwise could break your machine beyond
repair. IBM's Year 2000 site for firmware information is in
Resources. Virtually all of IBM's PReP machines are listed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xee7580.0xfe00b0"></a>Disclaimer</h2></div></div><p>The information in this article was gleaned from various web
