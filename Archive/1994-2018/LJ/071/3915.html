    Learning algebra can be fun using a computer and software from
    Learning Logic Labs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28d5580.0x29cd2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I remember a summer day that was as
wonderful as a carefree day can be, but it slipped away to produce
probably the worst day of my life. For on that day, I received my
eighth-grade algebra schedule. How was it possible that I had been
placed in Mr. Johnston's class? He, who was capable of striking
fear in the hearts of even the boldest of my classmates. Didn't he
slam students against the lockers? Didn't he yell at them in class?
How was I, a quiet and shy thirteen-year-old, to survive the year?
I felt there just had to be some mistake. It wasn't fair that this
was happening to me, considering math was usually my favorite
class. But no, there wasn't any mistake or any getting out of it.
Mr. Johnston's algebra class became a reality for the next nine
months of my young life. I discovered he was even more fearsome
than I had heard. I decided my goal for the year wasn't to get an
&ldquo;A&rdquo;, but to survive until June! Even though Mr. Johnston is
tough, I soon learned first-hand that he is an excellent teacher
who cares deeply about his students. I made this discovery shortly
after the third week of school. I finally began to breathe easier,
relax a bit in class and enjoy the work.
</p><p>By the beginning of the second six weeks, I was getting
bored. Could it be because I understood how to solve the equation
the first time he showed us how? Why couldn't he just let me go
ahead and solve the equations once I understood? I didn't need his
help after the first time. I was getting frustrated! Does this
sound familiar? No doubt some of you have been in the same
situation. You've had to endure a class in which the instructor was
teaching at a rate geared for the average student rather than your
faster rate. Or, perhaps the opposite is more accurate. You feel
totally lost, everyone else is catching on quickly, and the teacher
is leaving you behind.</p><p>Wouldn't it be nice if all learners could move at their own
rate, rather than be forced to move at the teacher's pace? Students
would have the best of both worlds if material were fully explained
on a computer screen, so the classroom teacher would be free to
work individually with the student if a problem occurred. Think of
the advantages to having all material randomized, so that students
on the same screen would be presented a different set of problems.
This would mean students couldn't copy answers from each other on
homework or tests. Imagine having homework assignments
automatically printed with the student's name, and later checked by
the computer for immediate feedback.</p><p>How about automatically generated tests, presented to cover
specific material the student has mastered since the last test?
Consider the increased teacher productivity that could result from
all students working independently on material specific to their
needs, and grades being managed by a gradebook feature. How about
the luxury of being able to schedule students assigned to
Pre-algebra, Algebra I and Algebra II into one computer lab during
the same period of time? What about the advantage for students
mastering a section of material before they move on, so as to avoid
of misunderstanding showing up in a later course? Consider the
convenience of having the program automatically download
enhancements and additional courseware as they become available.
Imagine all this, along with a mechanism for teachers and students
to communicate directly with program developers.</p><p>Do these features sound like a math teacher's dream? They're
a reality with the development of Learning Logic (L2). A
self-paced, computerized algebra program, Learning Logic is
currently being used in algebra classrooms in twelve U.S. states
and runs on a Red Hat 5.2 Linux platform.</p><p>The average Learning Logic Lab consists of a single Linux
server. Students work on X terminals running in 1024x768 mode
connected to the server via a 10- or 100-base twisted-pair network.
A PostScript-capable printer automatically prints student homework
and tests. A classroom modem allows the NSCF to connect remotely to
the server. A PPP connection to the server can also be set up to
assist the NSCF Support Team in diagnosing any possible problems.
The programs Maple and Reduce are used as an artificial
intelligence engine for evaluating a wide range of possible student
answers.</p><p>Why Linux? For starters, it's a free operating system! The
source is freely available, so if there is a need to fix something,
it can be done without external assistance. It's also much easier
to debug. Linux has message and error logs to indicate specific
problems, and if that doesn't work, one can always read the core
files. It comes with networking built in, so there is no need for
third-party software. Compilers and development libraries already
exist, so there is no need to buy expensive libraries.</p><p>Drivers evolve quickly since many people worldwide are
working in Linux to develop software. Many commercially available
UNIX systems don't have the driver support, due mostly to a limited
staff. Often, one has to buy extra driver packs.</p><p>With Linux, most drivers are free. In addition, Linux does
not install a new package or replace system libraries without
letting users know. Window programs often store things in the main
system directories when a new program is installed. This can cause
a problem if the libraries are different. Linux updates are quick,
and mail and network services are usually included in any
commercially available release. They usually include the source
code.</p><p>Linux is particularly well-suited for a school environment
for several reasons. Firewalling and other forms of network
security are built into the OS, and Linux supports them at the
kernel level. As with most types of UNIX, viruses are virtually
nonexistent in Linux. There are also a number of drivers available,
and Linux does not throw away the <span   class="emphasis"><em>obsolete</em></span>
drivers just because someone <span   class="emphasis"><em>thinks</em></span> no one
uses them any longer. Schools are generally on limited budgets, so
they often have to make do with older hardware. Most importantly,
with Linux a standard PC can be used to run an entire classroom of
25-30 workstations.</p><p>Why Red Hat? When project development began, Slackware was
used before migrating to Red Hat Linux 4.1. Even though it was not
free, at the time Red Hat was the easiest to install and had the
most professional installation interface. Essentially, it had
everything needed right out of the box. RPMs make it easier to
install updates and fixes, and it provides a common database to
search through to determine which version of a specific package is
installed. Learning Logic was created at the National Science
Center Foundation (NSCF), a not-for-profit foundation located in
Augusta, GA. The NSCF has no salespeople and Learning Logic is
spread mainly by word of mouth. Teachers are attracted to Learning
Logic's flexibility, its ability to be tailored to meet the needs
of the individual student and its variety of teacher management and
reporting tools such as the gradebook feature.</p><p>Some schools report that students who use Learning Logic
Algebra I are faring better than their peers when both groups reach
Algebra II. Data indicate that L2 students in these schools
maintain a lower Algebra II failure rate. Teachers also report that
L2 students tend to make more As and Bs in Algebra II, compared to
students who are not exposed to Learning Logic Algebra I. In the
fall of 2000, Learning Logic will celebrate its tenth anniversary.
At its inception in 1989, a Motorola 88K multiprocessor system was
used in Learning Logic classrooms. SunOS, AIX, SCO and OSF/1 have
each been used as the operating system at some point. Now, faster
PCs and Linux result in improved capabilities and speed as well as
a wider range of hardware choices.</p><p>At the time Learning Logic was first introduced into schools
during its beta test period, UNIX had very few followers in the
secondary school arena. However, since Linux has gone to algebra
class in the form of Learning Logic, it has become more of a
household word in Learning Logic schools.</p></div></div>
