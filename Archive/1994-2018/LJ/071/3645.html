    Shell utilities can simplify the maintenance of
    your path variables.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa7580.0x2b9f608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Few UNIX users give much consideration to
their path variables. They are typically used in a &ldquo;set and
forget&rdquo; fashion, and consequently, they often end up like straggly
weeds, overgrown and unlovely. Take a look at this mess:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $PATH
/opt/kde/bin:/localbin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:
/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/stephen
/scripts:/home/stephen/bin:/opt/CC/test/bin:/usr/sbin:
/usr/bin/X11:/ora01/app
/oracle/product/7.3.2/bin:/scripts:/opt/CC/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
</pre>


Given this undifferentiated stream of characters, how long will it
take you to:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>List all the bin directories in PATH?
(<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> won't help&mdash;try it)</p></li><li><p>Swap the order of /bin and /usr/bin?</p></li><li><p>Remove that pesky /opt/CC/test/bin
directory?</p></li><li><p>Get rid of the duplicate directories?</p></li></ul></div>

Despite their apparent simplicity, path variables can be tricky
beasts to manipulate. It's all too easy to end up with duplicate
entries in a path, and even the act of checking the contents is not
straightforward. Adding a new directory to PATH is easy enough, but
even then you may end up with a duplicate, because your eyes don't
parse a colon-separated list efficiently.
</p><p>A path variable is any shell or environment variable
comprised of textual elements separated by colons. You are almost
certainly familiar with the so-called search path,
<b  >PATH</b>, which your shell uses to find executable
files, but there are other standard paths, such as
<b  >MANPATH</b>, which the man program uses to locate
man pages, and <b  >LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, which the
dynamic loader can use to find shared libraries.</p><p>Path variables consist of textual elements separated by
colons, and the (admittedly non-standard) term I use for these is
&ldquo;path element&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;pathel&rdquo;. (You'll also see the term
&ldquo;path prefix&rdquo; used, but not by me.) I'll also abbreviate &ldquo;path
variable&rdquo; to &ldquo;pathvar&rdquo;.</p><p>All the utilities I describe here assume the bash shell
(though there are Korn shell versions available as well), and they
have been tested using bash 1.14.7 and bash 2.03.4.</p><p>I assume you know how to set and access variables in a shell
and have used (or seen) shell control constructs (if, for and
while). I also assume you are not necessarily clear about shell
variables versus environment variables, or shell scripts versus
shell functions, and specifically, that you have no idea what
<span   class="bold"><b>eval</b></span> does.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa7580.0x2b9fd98"></a>Utilities</h2></div></div><p>Here's a brief description of some path-variable
utilities:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>addpath</b></span>: adds a
pathel to a pathvar only if the pathel cannot be found on the
pathvar (e.g.,
<b  >addpath -p NEWP/<i><tt>abc/</tt></i></b>).
</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>delpath</b></span>: removes
pathels from a pathvar (e.g., <b  >delpath -p NEWP
/<i><tt>abc/</tt></i></b>).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>edpath</b></span>: allows
editing, and thus arbitrary modifications, of a pathvar.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>listpath</b></span>: echoes
the pathels of a pathvar on separate lines; the output can then be
filtered using grep, for example.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>uniqpath</b></span>: removes
duplicate pathels from a pathvar.</p></li></ul></div><p>A good shell utility should provide some guidance to the
user, and accordingly, each pathvar utility has a
<b  >-h</b> option, which writes usage information to
standard output. Furthermore, a good utility should not be fragile;
it should check its arguments for sanity, as far as possible. This
is doubly important when an important variable such as PATH is
being altered. The path utilities share common option-handling code
to simplify this sanity checking.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa7580.0x2ba0630"></a>Taming Options and Arguments</h2></div></div><p>Traditionally, shell scripts have handled their options in a
somewhat ad hoc manner. The option-handling code in a script will
often comprise a hand-crafted loop around
<span   class="bold"><b>getopts</b></span> (which I'll describe
later); this loop sets variables and issues error statements, as
appropriate to the requested options. While this approach is
common, it requires duplication of code in every script that is
written. This is tedious and error-prone.</p><p><a href="3645l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Option-handling code generally performs a small set of
functions (i.e., setting variables and issuing messages), so we can
usefully write a shell function to standardize this behaviour. Take
a look at Listing 1, a shell script called
<span   class="bold"><b>testoptions</b></span>.</p><p>To run this script, we could make the file executable by the
owner (<b  >chmod u+x testoptions</b>) and type its name.
If you do that, you should see something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ testoptions
./testoptions: options: command not found
</pre><p>This occurs because line 3 of the script refers to
<span   class="bold"><b>options</b></span>, a shell function, which
we haven't told the shell about yet. When we do so, we can run
testoptions again, this time with some arguments:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ testoptions -a -b fred -d
opt_a=1
opt_b=fred
opt_c=
options_missing_arg=
options_unknown_option=d
options_num_args_left=0
</pre>


Now, the shell function options has looked at its first argument
(&ldquo;ab:c&rdquo;), a coded specification of the name and type of the
expected options. It uses this to interpret its remaining
arguments, which in this case are all those originally passed to
testoptions (i.e., <b  >-a</b> <b  >-b</b>,
<b  >fred</b> and <b  >-d</b> because
<b  >$@</b> is converted into a quoted list of all
arguments to the script).
</p><p>The argument specification (ab:c) is in the form expected by
the <span   class="bold"><b>getopts</b></span> command and means &ldquo;we
take three options, <b  >-a</b>, <b  >-b</b>
and <b  >-c</b>, and <b  >-b</b> requires an
argument&rdquo;. The fact that <b  >-b</b> requires an
argument is indicated by the colon.</p><p>Each time the options function sees one of the allowed
options in its argument list, it creates a new shell variable
indicating the argument was present. So, for example, when the
second argument (<b  >-a</b>) is examined, options
creates a variable called <b  >opt_a</b> and sets its
value to 1. Similarly, if an illegal option is passed, options
creates a variable called <b  >options_unknown_option</b>
and sets its value to the name of the illegal option. As you can
see from the output shown above, if an option requires an argument,
the supplied argument is used as the value of the new variable.
(Perl scripters will recognize this behaviour from the Getopts
modules, which were, in fact, the inspiration for options.)</p><p><a href="3645l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>The fundamental problem is that options can't know in advance
which variable names it will have to create, so they can't simply
be hard coded in some way (at least not efficiently). Listing 2 is
the code for options. The first couple of lines inform the shell
that what follows is a shell function. A shell function is a
collection of commands in a file that can be run by typing that
name (i.e., typing <b  >options</b> in a shell runs the
commands in that script) and that run in the context of the shell
calling the function. This last part is important; that is, when a
shell runs a function, its commands take effect in that shell, in
the same way as commands typed on the command line of an
interactive shell. You should compare this to the effect of
commands executed in a shell script, where a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> shell is created to run the commands. For
example, if you execute the command
<span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span> in a shell function, the
current directory will be altered; in a shell script, the cd will
take effect only in the new shell created by running the script.
When the script has finished, you'll be in the same directory as
before you ran it. Shell functions also have numbered arguments
(i.e., <b  >$1</b>, <b  >$2</b>, etc.) just
like scripts.</p><p>The next part of options performs some initializations. The
first six executable lines declare variables. Since code in a
function executes as if it was run in the calling shell, if we
create a variable in a function, it will exist in the shell at the
end of the function. If we don't want this behavior, we can make a
variable local to a function by preceding it with the reserved word
<b  >typeset</b>. (In bash, you can use
<b  >local</b> instead, but <b  >typeset</b>
works in ksh, too.) Thus, the variable <b  >opts</b> will
not exist at the end of options, but
<b  >options_shift_val</b> will, for example.</p><p>After checking the number of arguments, we set
<b  >opts</b> to the value of the argument
<b  >spec</b>, with an additional leading colon. So, with
our testoptions values, <b  >opts</b> would contain
<b  >:ab:c</b>. The leading colon prevents getopts from
issuing spurious error messages. The first argument is then shifted
away by the <span   class="bold"><b>shift</b></span> command. This
means the argument that was <b  >$2</b> becomes
<b  >$1</b>, <b  >$3</b> becomes
<b  >$2</b>, and so on. This is a common trick in shell
scripting, used when an argument is no longer needed.</p><p>The meat of the function begins with the line
<b  >OPTERR=0</b>. This code section does the work of
examining the options and creating the variables. We delegate the
option examination to getopts and create variables using
eval.</p><p>The shell command <span   class="bold"><b>getopts</b></span>
examines the positional parameters (<b  >$1</b>,
<b  >$2</b>, etc.). When you call it the first time, it
examines <b  >$1</b>; the next time
<b  >$2</b>, and so on. When called in a while loop as in
Listing 2, it will look at all positional parameters and return
<b  >false</b> when finished, thus terminating the loop.
Remember, options expects its first argument to be the getopts
specification, and the remaining arguments to be positional
parameters. However, we shifted the getopts specification away, so
<b  >$1</b>, <b  >$2</b> and so on are indeed
the positional parameters when getopts examines them. The
<b  >$opts</b> argument to getopts tells it the legal set
of arguments, as described above.</p><p>If getopts sees a legal option, it stores it without the
leading <b  >-</b> in the <b  >argname</b>
variable, and if that option takes an argument, it stores that
argument in a variable called <b  >OPTARG</b>. If an
incorrect option is seen, getopts stores an error code in
<b  >argname</b> and the name of the incorrect option in
<b  >OPTARG</b>. There are two sorts of incorrect
options:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An option in which the name is not listed in the
getopts specification. In this case, getopts stores
<b  >?</b> in <b  >argname</b>.</p></li><li><p>An option requiring an argument, but where the
argument is missing; getopts stores <b  >:</b> in
<b  >argname</b> if this occurs.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> getopts has a bug: it
stores <b  >?</b> in both these cases. Listing 2 contains
a workaround. <span   class="bold"><b>ksh</b></span> does not have
this problem.
</p><p>If neither of these problems occurs, we have a valid option
and can go on to create a variable. This is done in the final
<b  >if</b> statement in the loop. The
<b  >then</b> branch handles the case when the option has
an argument and the <b  >else</b> branch handles the case
when there is no argument; both use eval. Let's look at one of
these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eval opt_$argname=$OPTARG  # set option name
</pre><p>Suppose we're processing the <b  >-b</b> option
with an argument of <b  >fred</b>:
<b  >argname</b> will contain <b  >b</b> and
<b  >OPTARG</b> will contain <b  >fred</b>. We
want the shell to run this code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
opt_b=fred
</pre>


Our first attempt is likely to be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
opt_$argname=$OPTARG
</pre>


reasoning that the shell will replace <b  >$argname</b>
by <b  >b</b>, <b  >$OPTARG</b> by
<b  >fred</b>, and we're done. Good try, but it doesn't
work. If you're sitting in front of a bash shell prompt now, try
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ argname=b
$ OPTARG=fred
$ opt_$argname=$OPTARG
</pre>


You should see this message: <b  >bash: opt_b=fred: command not
found</b>.
</p><p>Which command is not found? The shell did indeed expand the
variables. The problem is that, although the shell has generated
the string <b  >opt_b=fred</b>, it considers its work on
the line to be finished and tries to execute a program called
&ldquo;opt_b=fred&rdquo;. Although the line after processing looks like a
shell command, the shell won't notice this, because it processes
each line only once. To fix this problem, we need to instruct the
shell to expand the variables in this line and then start over
again, processing the line as if it is the first time. That is
precisely what the eval at the start of the line accomplishes. When
the shell processes an expanded line, it will recognize eval as a
command to create a shell variable and will create one.</p><p>Remember, these variables are being created in a function and
will continue to exist after the function has terminated. Thus, we
can call the options function from a script (or indeed another
function) and use the variables it has created in any way we
like.</p><p>In the interest of space, I have not described all the steps
the shell performs when it expands a command line; for the gory
details, consult <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the Bash Shell</em></span> from
O'Reilly &amp; Associates.</p><p>To ensure the shell knows about a function, there is one
option in bash and two in ksh. In bash, you must &ldquo;source&rdquo; the
file containing the function in one of your start-up scripts such
as .bash_profile (or equivalently, include the code directly in the
start-up script). In ksh, too, you can source a file in a start-up
script, or alternatively, put your function files in a directory
(perhaps called $HOME/functions) and add this directory to the
<b  >FPATH</b> environment variable. When you type the
name of a command unknown to ksh, it looks in the directories in
<b  >FPATH</b> to see if there is a function file with
that name. If so, it reads the file, remembers the function
definition and executes it.</p></div></div>
