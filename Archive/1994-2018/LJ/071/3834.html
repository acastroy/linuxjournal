Do I need to include something more in my chat to make the modem

</p><p>There isn't anything else you should include in your chat
script; however, some servers may be slow to start up the LCP
communication, and thus your <span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span>
daemon will timeout before then. To raise the number of LCP
configure-request packets before pppd determines it is not
responding, you can add the <b  >lcp-max-configure</b>
option to your /etc/ppp/options file, followed by the number of
LCPs to send. For example,
<b  >lcp-max-configure&nbsp;30</b>  would raise the
number from the default of 10 to 30. You might also want to remove
the&mdash;Andy Bradford, andyb@calderasystems.com</p><p>You need to add <b  >debug</b> on your pppd command
line and look at the /var/log/messages file. You also want to
replace chat with <b  >chat -v</b>. Those two combined
will give you lots of debug output and hopefully a better idea of
what is failing and where.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,

driver for my printer. I'm getting dependency issues. The files
required (as printed by <span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>)
are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libc.so.6(GLIBC2.0) libc.so.6(GLIBC2.1) libm.so.6(GLIBC2.0)
libm.so.6(GLIBC2.1)
</pre><p>I've upgraded the libc libraries to glibc 2.1, but this
seemed to have no effect. Looking at the dependency list, it also
seems to need libc.so.6 and libm.so.6 without the GLIBC attached,
and it has no problem finding these. I've looked at FTP sites for
files with these names and cannot find them. Can anyone tell me
what these are and if I need to find them, or whether I can tell
rpm to ignore them?  &mdash;Doug Morgan, dmorgan@cfa.harvard.edu
</p><p>Often, a dependency on libc6 or libm6 means only that the
binaries were compiled to use these versions of the libraries&mdash;they
can often be recompiled against an older libc/libm without any
problems. To do this, grab the SRPM (it should have the extension
.src.rpm), do</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm --rebuild
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>and install the resulting binary .rpm. Use this
approach with caution, as there are applications that exhibit bugs
under the older libc/libm (or won't compile). Still, in my
experience, it generally works just fine.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,
maxwell@ScottMaxwell.org</em></span>
</p><p>Although you can install glibc 2.1 on a glibc 2.0 system, it
may be better for you to upgrade your system to SuSE 6.3 instead.
However, if you do have all the libraries installed, but for some
reason the RPM database doesn't agree, you can force the package to
install with
<b  >rpm&nbsp;--nodeps&nbsp;<i><tt>package</tt></i>.i386.rpm</b>.</p><p>Another option is to get the .src.rpm version of your package
and rebuild it for your system: <b  >rpm --rebuild
<i><tt>package</tt></i>.src.rpm</b>. The resulting
package should be in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,

wondering if Linux supports this. I have heard Linux is the best
OS, and I have heard Windows NT is the only OS that supports
multi-processing.  &mdash;William Cason, fordsho@bellsouth.net</p><p>Linux does indeed support SMP. In fact, I use a fast dual-CPU
Linux box at work.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell, maxwell@ScottMaxwell.org</p><p>Linux may or may not be &ldquo;the best&rdquo;, depending on what
you're trying to do and what you're looking for. It does support
multi-CPUs on recent kernels (2.2.x), and some distributions like
Red Hat support SMP at install time. Some require you to compile
your own kernel.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, merlin_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x139c580.0x1494e48"></a>Radio Days</h2></div></div><p>I run Linux Red Hat 6.0 and Netscape 4.7, and I am struggling
to install Real Player. I successfully installed (using RPM) Real
Player 5.0 (<span   class="bold"><b>rvplayer</b></span>) and verified
using GNOME; RPM shows the program is installed correctly. In the
Netscape options, I set up MIME for file RA and RAM to use
rvplayer. When I click on an Internet site with radio, nothing
happens. There is a message on a Linux newsgroup, saying there
seems to be a problem with rvplayer 5.0 and the 2.2.  &mdash;Yossi
HaYored, hayored@mindspring.com</p><p>That is correct; you need the beta version of the G2 player.
You can get it from

Merlin, merlin_bts@valinux.com</p><p>I had trouble getting rvplayer 5.0 to work on a 2.2.5 kernel
myself, but rvplayer 6.0 worked just fine for me.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,

successful installation using a monitor other than my personal one.
When I took it home to my monitor, it gave me a blank screen, and
the monitor's on light goes from green to maroon, indicating a
problem after it entered its graphical interface. When I try to
reinstall Linux Mandrake or Caldera 2.2, it gives me a blank screen
when it does its graphical interface or when I try to probe for a
video card. I have a Compaq V50 monitor and Creative Labs 4MB video
card. When I was able to get a successful installation, I was using
a Micron monitor. Could there be a compatibility issue, and will
there be a way to get Linux installed at all? This monitor
configuration works with Windows just fine.  &mdash;Andy Kissner,
thekiss@netzero.net</p><p>What's apparently happening is that X is trying to drive your
monitor too hard. For this reason, graphical installs are not
necessarily going to work. At least with Red Hat, you can ask for a
text-mode install when you boot the first floppy. Some
distributions, like Debian, will install only in text mode, which
is fine for you, and others expect to see a VESA-2-compliant video
card and a monitor that can accept suitable refresh rates. Your
best bet, once a distribution is installed, is to edit XF86Config
(usually in /etc/X11 or /etc) and reduce the value of those two
parameters:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
HorizSync 30-50
VertRefresh 50-70
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The values given here may work, but you should
really put in the ones specified in your monitor's manual.  &mdash;Marc

mounting and unmounting everything in /dev, but that seems
particularly ungraceful.</p><p>2. How do I log out? I can switch to superuser and shut down,
but letting my kids and wife be superuser defeats at least one
reason for preferring Linux over Windows.</p><p>3. I tried to set my default shell to tcsh instead of bash.
It doesn't seem to have taken. In particular, my .cshrc file (or
.tcshrc) is not read at login.  &mdash;Tim Allison,
tallison@logicon.com</p><p>1. The answer is very different, depending on whether your
Zip is parallel, IDE or SCSI. There are two HOWTOs which you should
read: ZIP-Drive and ZIP-Install.</p><p>2. In a shell, type <b  >logout</b>. In X, you have
to find the logout option. It depends on which window manager you
are using and whether you use XDM (runlevel 5). When in doubt,
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >BACKSPACE</b>
will kill your X session, but that's the sledgehammer
approach.</p><p>3. To change your shell, you can use
<span   class="bold"><b>chsh</b></span> or simply edit /etc/passwd
and change the last field for root. Make sure that whatever shell
you specify exists. To find out which shell you are currently
running, try <b  >echo&nbsp;$SHELL</b>. If you are indeed
running tcsh, try doing an <span   class="bold"><b>echo</b></span> in
~/.tcshrc to see if it is run or not, and consult the tcsh man page
which explains which files are being run, depending on whether your
shell is a login shell or not.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,
