    Since our readers are Linux enthusiasts who would prefer to work
    with a Linux system rather than a Windows one, this month's focus is on Linux
    training.

came to talk to the students about our futures: jobs and options
available after graduation. One thing every one of them stressed
was the importance of going on to get further education and
training. Without it, we were told we would face a life of work in
the food industry or as sales clerks or low-level car mechanics. We
were shown charts of how much more money we would make with the
proper university degree or training certificate for the job we
wanted. These things are still a top priority for most people
entering the work force today. Developing skills that are fun as
well as attractive to business consumes the minds of students
approaching graduation and entering the real world.
</p><p>Since our readers are Linux enthusiasts who would prefer to
work with a Linux system rather than a Windows one, this month's
focus is on Linux training. Training is needed so we can get out
there and actually support ourselves using our favorite operating
system. Many ways of getting that training are available, and we
take a look at the ones most in use: traditional classrooms and
web-based courses. All are geared toward getting Linux
certification so that you can prove your worthiness to potential
employers. We also have updates from the two existing certification
programs: Linux Professional Institute and SAIR Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25b7580.0x26af348"></a>Columns</h2></div></div><p>We hope you have been enjoying our new &ldquo;Cooking with Linux&rdquo;
column, which premiered last September and began in earnest with
the January issue. Marcel Gagn&eacute; is a talented author who has
written for us in the past, and we are happy to have him join us as
a regular contributor. He also writes a column called &ldquo;SysAdmin's
Corner&rdquo; which appears on our web site
(<a href="/" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/</a>). Marcel is a
Linux geek with a nice sense of humor&mdash;what a guy!</p><p>Another web column you might like is &ldquo;Currents&rdquo; by Bryan
Pfaffenberger, a university professor with a keen intellect, who
probes the issues facing the computer and software industry today.
He challenges us to think and form our own opinions about open
source, copyrights, software patents and more.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson, Editor in Chief</p><p><a href="3858s1.html" target="_self">Contents</a></p></div></div>
