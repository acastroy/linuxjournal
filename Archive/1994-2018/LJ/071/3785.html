    The president of Future Technologies describes his FTLinux
    Course training program for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4b5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Some time ago, I heard that success in
mathematics means being able to formulate a good question and
answer it. When I decided to write a book for Linux, the question I
proposed was, &ldquo;What is the best way to teach Linux to novice Linux
users?&rdquo; My answer was to write a course in Hyper Text Markup
Language (HTML). HTML is cross-platform, so the course can be read
on any PC: Windows, Macintosh, OS/2, BeOS, UNIX and Linux. HTML is
the most-used language on the Web, where Linux users generally go
to download software, browse and consult resources.
</p><p>I also include the <span   class="bold"><b>man2html</b></span>
program, so customers can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>learn Linux in a nice environment, such as a web
site</p></li><li><p>browse Linux files on the Linux file system</p></li><li><p>consult Linux man pages</p></li><li><p>move quickly through the course</p></li><li><p>go directly to the Web or FTP site to browse for
information or download software</p></li></ul></div><p>My intention for this course was to support as many languages
as possible. I regularly speak Spanish, Italian and English, so it
was natural for me to write the course in these languages. Demand
for German Linux technology is high from a commercial and a
technical point of view, and France moved to Linux some months
after the rest of Europe, so I also include these languages. Our
contract with ADC Japan
(<a href="http://www.adc.co.jp" target="_self">http://www.adc.co.jp/</a>)
allows us also to include Japanese. Future languages will probably
be Portuguese, Turkish, Hebrew and Chinese, but this will depend on
the market.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4bbe0"></a>The Project</h2></div></div><p>I drew on my twenty years in computer science and my various
technical jobs with UNIX to write this course. I organized the
project into the following sections:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>BASE: dedicated to new Linux users</p></li><li><p>WebMaster: for HTML programmers, webmasters and
web-server installers</p></li><li><p>X Window: dedicated to X Window System users and
programmers; also Tcl/Tk and Java X techniques</p></li><li><p>System Integrator: how to integrate MS Windows,
Macintosh and other operating systems in Linux networks</p></li><li><p>System Administrator: the specific role of the
system administrator in companies, includes in-depth shell
programming</p></li><li><p>Programming: for C/C++ programmers, also network
programming techniques</p></li></ul></div><p>The BASE course was originally written for Caldera OpenLinux
in Italian. I started to write it for OpenLinux 1.0 in 1997,
slowly. The course has been updated to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.2 and now
2.3. The first edition, FTLinuxCourse 1.0 for OpenLinux 1.3, was
released in Italy for the Italian market in December 1998. In
February 1999, we released the version for the U.S. market.
</p><p>The Red Hat course was written directly in English, then
translated into Italian. The latest version, 2.3, covers the latest
Red Hat, SuSE and LinuxPPC distributions.</p><p>I have developed some useful shells and samples that are
included in the FTContribs directory. I also contacted O'Reilly
&amp; Associates to include all the examples from the O'Reilly book
series in the BASE CD-ROM. My friends at Xi Graphics gave me
authorization to include the latest AX and LX demo.</p><p>In addition to the 40MB of coursework (excluding the course
material in PostScript and Adobe PDF formats), there are 10MB of
shells, TeX, LaTeX and PiCTeX examples available, our contributions
in the FTContrib, plus more than 250MB of ExternalContribs,
including examples from books (such as the O'Reilly series and
others), articles from the Web, Netscape checkers, RFC and other
software.</p><p>The product is continuously updated and includes Linux news,
free software and more. The latest decision was to include the
Linux OS itself.</p><p>The WebMaster course is new and important. It includes HTML
programming and Internet web-server installation.</p><p>The X Window System was created in 1984. After several years
of use on expensive UNIX workstations, Linux helped move X to the
desktop. Today, for less than $80 US, it is possible to design and
write X programs. Understanding and learning how to program X can
be hard work. The X Window course covers many topics including
C/C++, Tcl/Tk and Java programming, from the command line or by
using builders such as <span   class="bold"><b>dtbuild</b></span> or
KDevelop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c420"></a>Why a Training Product for Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Linux is free. People can download it off the Internet or
install it from a CD-ROM. Each distribution includes a manual that
explains Linux installation duplication. Users will then need a way
to enter the Linux universe and learn the commands, how to search
files, how to change the resource on an X application, how to
create users, how to run a program in the background, etc. To
supply tutorials for this method was the main reason I wrote the
course.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c528"></a>Certification or Not?</h2></div></div><p>This is another interesting question. The answer must be
vendor-independent. Linux is not a single vendor, but comes from
many working together. To be certified on Linux means to know Linux
regardless of distribution. After learning the distributions,
students can then study Networking (covered in the System
Integrator course), X (covered in the X Window course), Programming
(covered in the WebMaster: HTML Programming, X Window and
Programming courses), System Administration (covered in the
relative course) and so on.</p><p>Instead of becoming certified, the student must become a
master or guru. The word &ldquo;certified&rdquo; means certified by someone
or some company. A single, fixed choice in Linux is wrong. Linux is
a successful operating system because it is horizontal; it is
graphical, supports shell programming from the command line,
supports binaries from other operating systems, includes games, is
stable, is serious, is funny&mdash;it is everything. Having a
certificate in Linux should mean knowing about all Linux topics and
all Linux distributions, not just one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c688"></a>Who Are the Linux Experts?</h2></div></div><p>A Linux expert may be a young hacker or an old UNIX expert.
The UNIX experts need to know how Linux is different from UNIX. For
example, Linux kernel compilation is completely different from any
previous UNIX models. The concept of kernel modules and the kernel
organization is new, so the &ldquo;old&rdquo; UNIX experts will need to learn
it. From the other side, both the great and young Linux experts
should study the UNIX story. Linux history starts with the UNIX
story, not from Torvalds' first kernel release. The kernel was the
conclusive link in a long chain including the GNU software, the X
Window System, TeX and other freeware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c790"></a>Going Further on Training</h2></div></div><p>During the first months of 2000, FTLinuxCourse (also called
Fast Training Linux Course) will reach version 3.0. In this
version, we will expand the Linux Command Reference from 163
commands with examples to 1,000. We will also include a search tool
and an analytical index. We will cover more on Tcl/Tk, Python, Perl
and other programming tools.</p><p>At the moment, FTLinuxCourse includes the course on CD-ROM
and a Linux CD-ROM. The GOLD edition comes with a course for
Caldera, Red Hat and SuSE, along with their respective CD-ROMs. We
are talking to an Italian publishing company about presenting
FTLinuxCourse and to Sun Italy about including StarOffice. When
this step is concluded, FTLinuxCourse users will have a complete
course with more than 1,000 questions and answers, a Linux
distribution and StarOffice. In February 2000, we will begin to
develop a DVD version&mdash;a video course for Linux in all
languages.</p><p>We are also working on a new project called &ldquo;Linux Web
Campus&rdquo;. Like a university campus, we will recruit Linux experts
as teachers and teach people from the Web. Linux enthusiasts can
subscribe to a specific course from any city in the world and take
classes on the Web. The campus is based on the original &ldquo;Learning
Networks&rdquo; idea. In the beginning, we plan to use only HTML pages
to teach Linux and test Linux knowledge with CGI exams. The final
goal of LinuxWebCampus is to create Linux experts who can teach
Linux to others, from the same web campus or elsewhere.</p><p>Another project is creating Linux Utilities (dedicated to
Peter Norton), to simplify Linux tasks such as kernel
recompilation. This project will also extend Linux from a UNIX
point of view. These utilities will be offered for download from
the LinuxUtilities.org web site or on a CD-ROM at low cost.</p><p>The last project involves teaching customers how to build
their own Linux distribution. This is a very futuristic project. We
will develop utilities to locate, test and install remote Linux
programs. We will show how to create a minimal Linux distribution
including the Caldera LIZARD (available for free at OpenLinux.org),
the RPM from Red Hat, KDE, our LinuxUtilities and other FT
applications.</p><p><a href="3785s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3785s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
