NetWinder could wind nets?&rdquo;--Dan Wilder, SSC Technical
Manager</em></span>
</p><p>And furthermore, what is a NetWinder? A NetWinder is a
StrongARM-based Linux box, built as a network server. NetWinders
come in three models: OfficeServer, Developer and ThinClient. Of
these, the OfficeServer and Developer models are the familiar
NetWinder server boxes, while the ThinClient is a new creation, a
graphic terminal the size of a notebook, which one would presumably
use with an OfficeServer. The Developer model is an expanded
OfficeServer designed, as one might infer, for developers. It has
more interfaces and development tools, as well as an active
developer community. The OfficeServer, our subject for today, is
the standard NetWinder, a device on which to run your networks,
whether they are dozens of office computers or just a few terminals
around your house.</p><p>Any old Linux box can function just fine as a server (at last
estimate, more of the Internet was running on &ldquo;any old Linux box&rdquo;
than anything else), but the NetWinder isn't any old Linux box. The
core of the NetWinder is the StrongARM architecture, RISC
technology developed cooperatively by ARM and DEC (although DEC was
bought by Compaq, Intel now produces StrongARMs). We'll get into
the technical details of the chip later, but it's important to
appreciate some superficial differences in the processor which
enable the NetWinder to be so compact. StrongARM is popular with
embedded systems because it runs on little energy and stays cool.
Hence, the NetWinder can be tiny and resource-minimal, important
factors since it is designed to be on all the time. It is intended
to run headlessly; that is, without a monitor. Users need not know
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> about Linux to use a NetWinder, and
they may never even know which software it's running&mdash;it's just a
small magic box, exactly what most people want. Before we open up
the magician's funny box to see how it works, let's look at what it
does.</p><p>Late one morning, my co-workers heard me whining quite loudly
about my difficulties compiling some software on the NetWinder,
followed by, &ldquo;Good grief! It hasn't even got Netscape!&rdquo; Needless
to say, something had to be done to quiet me, so a fellow
suggested, &ldquo;Why don't you use it how it's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>supposed</em></span> to be used?&rdquo; In honor of this
fellow, we shall now use the NetWinder as it's meant to be used;
that is, as a headless Internet, file and print server.</p><p>Configuration of the NetWinder is fairly simple. As long as
you assign the NetWinder a valid IP address, you can plug it in and
immediately point a web browser at it. Configuration is supposed to
take place under Windows, but it can be done through any browser. I
actually prefer to plug in a monitor and keyboard, edit a couple of
files and have it up in short order. However, if you know nothing
at all about Linux, the web-based interface will walk you through
the installation. Although I have heard reports of some people
having trouble installing the NetWinder, I hardly had to do
anything to it. Perhaps I have a more recent edition.</p><p>Once initially configured, the NetWinder will cheerfully
perform (well, our last lightning storm that allegedly downed MS's
&ldquo;hacker-proof&rdquo; box also rebooted the NetWinder), and if you want
to make any changes, point your browser to its address and log in.
You can log in as a user or as an administrator. The user menu
offers directory information, infoplace document organization,
discussion group access, user profile access, a search menu and
on-line help. What these things do is self-explanatory; they exist
for generic users and office people, and the menus are clear and
simple.</p><p>The administration mode menu is essentially root, with menus
for editing user accounts, group data, host information, system
management, service availability and network configuration. Again,
the submenus are clear, allowing you to turn services on and off at
a single click. Using the NetWinder web interface is as easy as
accessing the web page of a printer (you may have noticed the
curious trend of printers having their own web servers). One might
expect a network server to be complicated, but it's not. Maybe
that's the point of the NetWinder; it's not necessarily more
powerful than a standard Linux box, but it's so accessible it makes
the power of Linux available to those who have not devoted years to
the study of UNIX-Linux networking power, with point-and-click
simplicity.</p><p>What can you do with a NetWinder? Let's say you're rich from
past mining exploits and you've got a mansion with over 60 rooms,
some of which you would like to wire for the Internet. There's been
a mammoth copy party and the guests have left computers all over:
some Macintoshes from pre-Linux days, a dozen Linux machines, a
couple of FreeBSD and NetBSD boxes, and even something running
BeOS. An evil spirit that haunts your house insists on running
Windows in the attic, so let's pretend you've got an NT box up
there. While looking for a solution, you suddenly hear a child's
voice say, &ldquo;Welcome to NetWinder!&rdquo; (which you'll hear
<span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> time you boot). Suddenly, you realize
you are now ready to network all your machines.</p><p>First, get a really big hub and an ISP account with
high-speed access: for example, DSL or cable modem. I recommend not
wasting any effort on ISDN. If you already have a LAN, you can add
the machine to the network and use the web interface to set
everything up. Otherwise, hook up a monitor, keyboard and mouse and
try manual configuration, either directly through editing files or
with the <span   class="bold"><b>nwconfig</b></span> program. As soon
as you can get to the NetWinder with a web browser, you can
configure everything quickly. Plug the 10 BT Ethernet into your DSL
or cable modem (or use the serial port if necessary), the 100 BT
Ethernet into your hub's uplink, then plug all your computers into
the hub. Configure individual addresses and names for them, and
you've got a network.</p><p>Presumably, you also want services. The NetWinder menus and
manual explain how to set up services. The obvious things to start
with would be the Web and e-mail, since these seem to consume most
on-line interest. Apache is always running so you can reach the
administration menu, but you can also run a generic web site with
it through virtual hosts; there's even a web page creator program,
although it's not exactly advanced. Hence, residents in your house
can have their own web pages. E-mail is simple to set up; just
enable SMTP through the administration menu, and point your local
mail reader to the NetWinder. To read the mail from your terminal
(instead of logging in to the NetWinder as a user), enable POP-3 or
IMAP services and tell your local mail reader the NetWinder's
address. You can establish e-mail forwarding and filtering and even
set up automatic response messages for when you're away.</p><p>The NetWinder can do whatever you expect of a Linux box,
including file and print sharing across UNIX, Macintosh and Windows
machines. Advanced administrators can do various things, from
establishing BBS-like threaded discussion forums to rather
bureaucratic things such as imposing quotas all over the place.
Using the NetWinder as it's designed to be used won't disappoint,
but would these machines be viable as home computers?</p><p>The NetWinder has almost everything you could want for a home
computer, except the software. The OfficeServer has Ethernet ports,
serial and parallel ports, PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, and even
an infrared receptor (presumably for wireless keyboards that aren't
supported), but it is missing some software. The most glaring
omissions are Netscape and <span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span>,
although I am told that Netscape should be ported soon and I
suspect gdb was left out by mistake. Also, the NetWinder's
distribution is an old Red Hat with FVWM95-2, and that's so
pass&eacute; these days. Debian works on the StrongARM and is now
the number-one choice of hackers, so Rebel.com ought to modernize a
bit. Anyhow, window managers and the Web enthuse me less than RISC
chips, so I thought I would learn about the chip by using gdb, but
that was not to be. However, I did find out about the chip through
some e-mails and a process someone called &ldquo;reverse engineering&rdquo;
(writing C programs, compiling with <b  >gcc -S</b>, and
deciphering the chip from there).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110b580.0x1204268"></a>The StrongARM Architecture</h2></div></div><p>If you haven't seen RISC assembly code before, it may be
strange to see so many operands on a single line. After all,
CISCers are used to simple syntax like MOV A,B (or MOV B,A). RISC
technology, by comparison, allows you to specify several operands
on a single line as well as communicate more than just the usual
relative, absolute and immediate addressing information. Although
many hackers these days avoid learning assembly code (ESR
recommends C, Python, Perl and LISP in his advice on how to be a
hacker), it is difficult to appreciate operating system design
without such knowledge. Of course, <span   class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> has
to know it or nothing could get implemented. When porting Linux to
a new platform (such as StrongARM), assembly code is more important
than is usually the case.</p><p>One fault of Linux that Tanenbaum criticized (not the least
politely) back in 1992 was that Linux was platform-specific, that
is, a monolithic kernel for Intel 386. Today, Linux has been ported
to several hardware platforms, and the kernel is more modular. We
need to be familiar enough with assembly code to be able to do the
porting and debugging work, and we must not get too dependent on
it, lest we write too much platform-specific code. The idea is,
Linux is superior to any hardware platform, so we use a
cross-platform assembler (meaning C) for the code and limit our
involvement with the specifics of the chips. (This way, when the
x86 dies, Linux lives.) Nevertheless, RISC chips are simple, with
only a few instructions, yet one can do so much on a single
instruction. RISC technology, particularly in the context of
parallel processing, is affiliated with the microkernel, and
hopefully we will see more of both in the future. In the meantime,
let's get back to the chip.</p><p>The StrongARM SA-110 has the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>16 32-bit registers for user programs (r0 through
r15)</p></li><li><p>21 basic opcode types, including 63 of what we
would typically consider opcodes in the CISC world (which when
multiplied by 15 conditionals would represent 945 instructions),
with a host of other operations available</p></li><li><p>one of fifteen conditionals available for every
opcode</p></li><li><p>2.1 million transistors (RISC economizes on
transistors, which is a bit ironic these days)</p></li><li><p>32KB of cache (16KB for instructions, 16KB for
data)</p></li><li><p>a 233 MHz operating speed, overclocked to 275 MHz
on the NetWinder for 250MIPS (million instructions per
second)</p></li></ul></div><p>The SA-110 has no math coprocessor. The chip performs
extremely well on tasks where the instructions and data can be
entirely cached and no floating-point operations are involved.
Tasks involving too much code and data to make use of the cache
become slow, and floating-point operations grind the chip to a
halt. While some of these differences have to do with how well the
Linux kernel and gcc jive with the chip set, without an FPU, a chip
is disadvantaged (but the StrongARM excels at floating-point
emulation, if you code specifically for it). If you check out the
benchmarks (see Table 1), you can see how scattered the results
are. I would not rest too much on them; the machine is quite perky,
despite its typically lower than K6/233 scores. My favorite
benchmark, the chess test, has NetWinder evaluating between 17 and
19 thousand positions every second (about one million per minute).
Rebel.com expects to have 600MHz StrongARMs soon, and if the
micro-architecture techniques get seriously improved (low power
consumption and desire to avoid pipeline stalls make speculative
execution and multiple branch prediction respectively impractical,
though unique qualities of ARM could make other tricks possible)
and the processor visits the debugger, future NetWinders should be
much faster. (But then again, how much processor power do you need
for e-mail, web, file, print, FTP and TELNET services?) The machine
in question has 64MB of memory (34.8MB free), with most services
turned on. As for disk access, Table 2 shows what Bonnie reports.
</p><p><a href="3802t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p><a href="3802t2.html" target="_self">Table 2</a></p><p>As you can see, the results are sporadic, with the processor
scoring lower than a K6/233 in many cases and the disk drive
operating much slower than a typical desktop hard drive. In spite
of the low benchmarks, the machine has never lagged on me and does
its tasks quite well. This is probably one case where the
benchmarks don't mean very much, unless you plan on using the
NetWinder for crunching numbers and maintaining huge databases. The
chip set is fun to use, and I think hackers who are interested in
the StrongARM might like to take a look at these machines, as well
as anyone who wants a simple machine for use as a server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110b580.0x1204b00"></a>A Different Chip Set</h2></div></div><p>The joy of C is that we can bring programs written in it
across hardware platforms without too much difficulty. This means
Linux should be able to hop onto the 64-bit architectures fairly
well. Desktop machines appear to be heading in the Alpha and
Itanium direction (is anyone else frustrated by Intel
architecture?), which bodes well for proponents of RISC. Ideally,
we will be heading in a microkernel direction as well. What does
this mean for the 32-bit StrongARM? Well, there's an active
development community bringing Linux to StrongARM. At
<a href="http://www.arm.uk.linux.org" target="_self">http://www.arm.uk.linux.org/</a>,
you can find the latest details, including screen shots of
Enlightenment running on a NetWinder, along with support for Acorn,
Archimedes, A5000 and various other ARM boxes. Intel makes
StrongARM right now but is pushing the IA-64, while Compaq has
recently been pointing out that Alphas are truly nice processors.
It seems as though the Wintel stranglehold on operating systems has
now been broken, and we are seeing more freedom in the chip area as
well (even Intel finds itself with more freedom). As long as we
keep Linux available across numerous chip sets (without network
externalities favoring one too heavily over the other), we can
offer a freedom to choose in the chip arena, which theoretically
should get us on better chip sets at lower cost. As long as
instruction sets stay free from patent and copyright restrictions,
we chip users should expect more happiness. In any event, at least
we're moving in a RISC direction, so the next logical steps would
involve multiple processors on the hardware end and microkernel
design in the software arena. The StrongARM itself seems destined
largely for embedded systems, but since embedded systems are a
strong point of Linux (for one reason, we have no licensing
issues), it's good to keep it supported.</p><p>If you get into StrongARM programming, you'll find yourself
able to use four operands with one opcode (or more if you get into
coprocessor instructions) and do things in a single line that would
have taken several in x86 or other CISC chips. One thing I like is
being able to perform a bit shift on the same line as a command.
For example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sub r1, r2, r3, lsl r4
</pre><p>would logically shift r3 to the left by the number in the
lower byte of r4, subtract this from r2, and put the answer in r1.
This is just one example of the efficiency of one command line in
ARM (and other RISC) instruction sets. Additionally, all
instructions are conditional (checked against the CPSR, current
program status register) and you can specify one of 15 conditions
for each instruction. Again, we're not supposed to get too
dependent on assembly code, but at least this one is fun to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110b580.0x150fb28"></a>Improvements</h2></div></div><p>No matter how Linux-based the NetWinder might be, it could
stand a couple of improvements. For one, the graphics driver
displays a VGA console with a 60Hz refresh rate, and that's too
slow. Also, when scrolling quickly through a text file in vi, the
NetWinder can skip a line; you might think you're editing one line,
but when you save the file, you discover you've actually rewritten
the line directly above. The perkiness and fast scrolling qualities
are nice, so I hope there is a solution to the line-skipping
problem other than slowing down the terminal. As for distributions,
it has been mentioned that Debian would be preferred, and a modern
window manager would be nice. I hope the newer StrongARMs get
faster and their unique design doesn't make it too difficult to
implement useful micro-architecture techniques which could
accelerate the chip considerably. It's a nice design, and I
wouldn't mind seeing these chips in 64-bit.</p><p>As for the software, criticisms of the UNIX model attack its
accessibility rather than its performance. The neat thing about the
NetWinder is that it brings accessibility to Linux networking. If
free software developers looked at the NetWinder model and
developed similar easy-to-use interfaces for configuring a network
on generic Linux boxes, Linux might come across as less
intimidating. The fact remains that computers
<span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be of service even to people who don't
want to devote their lives to them. Imagine if, without any
knowledge of Linux or UNIX, you could use a web browser and a cable
modem or DSL to have your own permanent net presence. At a click,
you could turn services, firewalls, web pages, e-mail services,
printers, etc. on and off. Essentially, this would have many of the
practical rewards of learning UNIX, without all the work. This is
already available with the NetWinder on StrongARM architecture, but
it won't become widespread until it's free. I would recommend that
Rebel.com release the NetWinder configuration software under GPL
(not a pseudo-free license); otherwise, we might want to consider
using it as a model for a free source project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x110b580.0x150fce0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>As an office server, it performs flawlessly. The web-based
interface makes Linux networking accessible to non-UNIX types. The
functions and features are based on the Linux kernel, GNU software
and various other projects such as Apache. (This is the &ldquo;it's
Linux, it has to be good&rdquo; principle&mdash;true once again.) The
benchmarks gave the NetWinder fairly low scores, but these are
misleading. The NetWinder is an inexpensive solution to the server
problem. If you have the technical know-how, you might be able to
do better for the price. For example, you could build your own
server and configure it yourself, delivering a faster machine
without too much effort. Still, if you want the web-based
interface, small size, low power consumption, ease of use and
corporate support, you'll do fine with a NetWinder. Developers
could really have fun with it, although I would recommend the
Developer model for them, since it's even more fun. We still have
to see if a good web browser gets ported to the NetWinder before we
know whether it will be a viable platform for normal Linux use.
Nevertheless, NetWinders may be only the beginning of clever uses
for ARM-based Linux. Try to get your Windows-using acquaintances to
buy one of these; it could be the start of something cool.</p></div></div>
