    Watching movies is a favorite leisure-time activity for many
    people. Today you can watch movies on your laptop computer
    as well as your TV screen. But can you do it with Linux?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1022580.0x111a558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Under most circumstances, when someone
refers to a DVD (digital versatile disc), they're talking about a
movie. After all, DVD originally stood for Digital Video Disc.
However, there's much more to the DVD standard than just the
DVD-Video format.
</p><p>Many new computers come equipped with DVD-ROM drives and a
Windows-based application for playing DVD-Video. The difference
between DVD-ROM and DVD-Video is comparable to the difference
between CD-ROMs and audio CDs. The DVD standard also includes
DVD-Audio (the likely successor to the audio CD), and the DVD-RAM
and DVD-R writable formats.</p><p>What's so great about these DVD formats? They store huge
amounts of data compared to a CD. The typical DVD can hold 4.7GB of
data, compared to the 650MB capacity of a CD.</p><p>Should your next computer have a DVD-ROM? It's clear that
DVD-ROMs are well on their way to replacing CD-ROMs. The additional
cost of a DVD-ROM over a CD-ROM is less than $100 and will continue
to drop.</p><p>DVD-ROM players can also read audio CDs and data CDs, so
there's no need to have both a CD-ROM and a DVD-ROM drive. However,
some older DVD-Video players are unable to read CD-R discs. I was
disappointed to find out that an audio CD-R I created worked fine
in a cheap portable CD player, but not in my (much more expensive)
DVD player. Strangely, the CD-RW media usually work fine. There's a
good technical explanation of this problem in the DVD FAQ. Newer
DVD-ROMs shouldn't suffer from this limitation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1022580.0x111a7c0"></a>Linux File Systems and DVD</h2></div></div><p>What you're probably wondering is whether or not you can use
a DVD-ROM under Linux. The good news is you can, and it's simple to
do.</p><p>Most DVDs use a bridged file system so they can be mounted
using either the ISO 9660 file system (used by CD-ROMs) or the
newer UDF file system. Most likely, your Linux kernel already has
support for ISO 9660 built in, so you should be able to mount a DVD
in your DVD-ROM drive.</p><p>If you want to try out the UDF file system, you will need to
either patch your 2.2 kernel or upgrade to the 2.3 kernel (or 2.4,
if it's out). The UDF file system offers some additional features
over ISO 9660, but none are necessary to read a DVD-ROM, unless it
is a UDF-only DVD.</p><p>Being able to read a DVD and play a DVD movie are two
different issues. You won't be able to pop your copy of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> in and watch it right away.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1022580.0x111aa28"></a>Playing DVD Videos</h2></div></div><p>It is possible to play DVD videos under Linux; however, at
this point, it's a challenge to do so. (See section on Breaking
DVD's Security.)</p><p>Two primary projects are underway to bring DVD Video playback
to Linux: LiViD (Linux Video and DVD Project) and LSDVD. The focus
of LSDVD is on a commercial, closed-source solution, while LiViD
aims to develop an open-source DVD player. Both projects are early
in the development process.</p><p>Movies can be decoded using either hardware or software.
Hardware decoding takes place in a dedicated card, such as
Creative's Dxr2 DVD Decoder. You can obtain a Linux driver for Dxr2
at Creative's open-source page. Software decoding requires a tool
to decrypt the Content Scrambling System (CSS) copy
protection.</p><p>If you don't have a Dxr2 card, you'll need a 500MHz Pentium
III or better to handle software decoding. The LiViD Linux DVD
HOW-TO provides instructions on setting up software
decoding.</p><p>You'll need to download some extra software, including a
kernel patch and the CSS decryption tool. However, due to legal
pressures, the needed CSS utility disappears from web pages soon
after it appears. If you're a skilled surfer, you should be able to
find a copy of the tool somewhere.</p><p>Convergence Integrated Media is working on a PCI DVD Decoder
card that will take care of CSS decrypting as well as video and
audio decoding. The card and Linux drivers should be available
soon.</p><p>If you're the adventurous type, try that DVD movie under
Linux. However, most users will want to wait until a more
user-friendly package for DVD-Video playback is available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1022580.0x111ad40"></a>Breaking DVD's Security</h2></div></div><p>DVD-Video uses a copyright protection scheme called the
Content Scrambling System (CSS) which is designed to prevent people
from duplicating the digital content of DVDs. Several groups of
Linux developers are working on creating a Linux DVD player. LSDVD
aims at creating a commercial player for Linux that will not be
open source, due to licensing restrictions and costs. (See their
home page for a good explanation of these costs.)</p><p>LiViD wants to create an open-source player. There are
open-source decoders for both the AC-3 audio and MPEG-2 video
formats found on DVDs. The CSS encryption was the last obstacle to
playing DVD movies on Linux.</p><p>A Norwegian group called MoRE reverse-engineered the
Windows-based software DVD player from Xing Technologies, a
subsidiary of Real Networks. They discovered a mistakenly
unencrypted key that could be used to unlock DVD movies.</p><p>It's interesting to note that U.S. export restrictions on
encryption played a part in this. The CSS scheme uses 40-bit
encryption, the U.S. export key-length limit, allowing the MoRE
team to crack the rest of the unencrypted keys. Thus, the export
restriction made MoRE's job easier.</p><p>MoRE made their work available to others by posting their
DeCSS decryption program, the CSS algorithm and the encryption keys
to the world.</p><p>The breaking of CSS caused wide speculation on the future of
DVD. Some suggested that certain movies wouldn't be released on
DVD. Others speculated that DVD-Audio players would be held up.
Most seem to agree that none of it would have happened if someone
had made a Linux DVD movie player available.</p><p><a href="3784s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3784s2.html" target="_self">Talking to Jens Axboe</a></p></div></div>
