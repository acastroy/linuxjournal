    Taking care of computers in schools can present special
    problems; this program solves them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e2b500"></a></h2></div></div><p>K12Admin is an account administration
system designed specifically for K-12 school systems. It can be
used to administer accounts on Linux servers in individual schools
from a central location. The interface to the system is web-based.
A teacher in a school who has been granted account-administration
rights will be able to create student and staff accounts, delete
accounts, create/delete local groups, modify the membership of
local and global groups and change passwords within that one
school.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e2b608"></a>History</h2></div></div><p>K12Admin was developed at Coast Mountains School District in
British Columbia, Canada. It was originally used to administer the
accounts in an NT domain. We needed a method for allowing staff in
one school to create accounts for their school without accidentally
messing with accounts from other schools. The web interface and
database ran on a Linux machine, and account changes were made on
the NT Primary Domain Controller using a TCP/IP connection. Soon
after this, we set up a Linux server in each town to use as an
authenticating proxy server. The Squid logs on each of these
servers were copied to the main account administration computer and
analyzed for potentially inappropriate use by scanning for a list
of keywords in the URL.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3578f1.large.jpg"><img src="3578f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Main K12Admin Menu
</p></div></div><p>Many accounts had already been created on the NT system
before we set up the Linux server for account administration, so we
did not have UNIX passwords for these accounts. To solve this
problem, we modified the source for the Squid proxy server so that
it redirected users to a page where they could &ldquo;register&rdquo; their
account if proxy authentication failed. The user name and password
they entered here were checked against a POP server running on an
NT server before being added to the password database on the Linux
servers.</p><p>Once we had UNIX passwords for all users, it became possible
to use Linux servers in the schools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e2b978"></a>Creating Accounts</h2></div></div><p>When accounts are created, a list of first and last names is
typed or pasted into a text box. Unique user IDs are created using
the first and last names of the users. There are currently two
different user ID creation schemes in K12Admin. One uses part of
the first name and all of the last name. Under this scheme, my user
ID might be stonnesen, sttonnesen, stetonnesen, etc. until a unique
user ID was found. The second scheme uses the first name and the
initial letter of the last name. Under this scheme, my user ID
might be stevet, stevet2 or stevet3 until a unique user ID was
found. This second scheme makes for a more anonymous user ID if
protection of children's privacy is a concern in your
district.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3578f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Form for Creating New Accounts
</p></div></div><p>When accounts are created, each user ID can be assigned an
individual password by the administrator, all accounts being
created can be assigned the same default password, or random
passwords can be generated for each account. Currently, the random
passwords generated consist of a three-letter word, a single digit,
plus another three-letter word (e.g., far6yet). With the word list
I'm using, this results in a password space of just under 2,000,000
passwords. Not exactly the best security you could ask for,
especially since my list of three-letter words is now quite public.
I am considering adding an option to generate truly random
passwords (such as &ldquo;a5Tr43Zp&rdquo;), but these are quite difficult for
students to remember. It might be better just to instruct students
(and staff) on good password-selection techniques and get them to
change their assigned passwords right away. K12Admin has
system-wide global groups that grant special-access privileges to
users:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Web Users</em></span>: members can
authenticate with a proxy server to access the Web.</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Dial-in Users</em></span>: members can

</p></div></div><p>In addition to the global groups, local groups can be created
which are unique to each school. These can be used to create class
groups (Grade 7, Grade 4/5, Division 14, etc.) or other logical
groupings (Yearbook Club, Computer Club, etc.).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e2c948"></a>Modifying Accounts</h2></div></div><p>Accounts can be modified by account administrators or by

<span   class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of computers. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>k12admin-server</em></span> will be the central account
administration computer for the district. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>k12admin-client</em></span> computers will typically be
Linux servers in the schools that update their account information
from the k12admin-server computer. These computers will likely be
used as web proxies, file servers, web servers, e-mail servers,
etc. Lastly, I will refer to the computers our users sit at as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>workstations</em></span>.</p><p>K12admin-client computers run updates once an hour. The
updates are done using <span   class="bold"><b>rsync</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> to securely and quickly copy
files from the k12admin-server and run a script, called &ldquo;setup&rdquo;,
which is part of these files. Password files (passwd/group,
shadow/gshadow, smbpasswd, squid.auth, apache.auth) on the client
are updated at this time. The hourly update also runs some audits
of the school server. Specifically, it scans the log files and
generates a synopsis of which accounts have been used and when.
This information is sent back to the k12admin-server computer,
where it is inserted into an audit database which can be queried by
the user. This allows a user to determine if their account is being
used inappropriately.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3578f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Audit of Account Usage for User &ldquo;demoteacher&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>The Squid proxy log files on the k12admin-client computer are
also scanned for potential inappropriate use. The log files are
scanned for one of a list of keywords. These keywords can be
grouped into different categories (porn, chat rooms, gaming,
executable downloads) and enabled or disabled on a per-school or
per-server basis. Again, this information is transferred to a
database on the k12admin-server where it can be reviewed by school
administrative staff at any time. A synopsis is also e-mailed to
school administrative staff weekly.</p><p>Individual k12admin-client servers can be configured from the
web page with a variety of options. They can be attached to one or
more schools. You can also have more than one server attached to
the same school. This allows you to have one server for two small
schools connected by Ethernet, or have several servers in a large
school. Servers can be configured to update passwd/group files,
update smbpasswd files, update Squid-authentication files, update
Apache-authentication files, create home directories for new
accounts, and clean up old home directories, either by deleting
them outright or moving them to a temporary holding area.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e23a70"></a>Planned Improvements</h2></div></div><p>The K12Admin system is quite functional as it stands.
However, my goal is to create a server appliance which can be
placed in a school and administered entirely through the K12Admin
interface. What I see happening in schools now is that a teacher is
given &ldquo;release&rdquo; time to maintain the network in the school.
Attempts to &ldquo;homogenize&rdquo; the network are difficult when teachers
in individual schools have invested significant amounts of time in
learning how to run their chosen network operating system and
setting up their network. In order to make K12Admin a viable
alternative, I see a few obstacles to overcome:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Server administration must be easy to learn. Since
K12Admin is geared specifically to a K-12 setting, it should have
an advantage over a vanilla, out-of-the-box, network operating
system.</p></li><li><p>The servers must be flexible enough to serve the
needs of all users in a K-12 setting. Since I have experience with
only one school district's way of doing things, I need feedback
from other users to determine which options are required to meet
their needs.</p></li><li><p>When problems do occur, they should be easy to
diagnose, both for technical staff and the users in the school. I
have some problem-diagnosis tools in place for monitoring disk
space, swap space and &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; printer spools. These tools need to
be expanded. I was hoping to incorporate the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;
network monitor to take care of some of this, but the license is
too restrictive.</p></li></ul></div><p>Here is a list of planned additions to K12Admin:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Creation of default shares on the client servers
(exported by Samba, Netatalk, NFS, Coda, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Applications: general applications used by client
computers, be they Macintosh, Windows, Linux or whatever. There
will, of course, be separate shares for each type of client
computer.</p></li><li><p>Library: share for library administration
software.</p></li><li><p>Administration: share for school administration
software.</p></li><li><p>Localgroups: share holds a directory for each local
group created within the school, accessible only by members of that
group. This share will contain a class folder for which teachers
have write access, a drop box, and a public folder to which
everyone can write. This makes it easy to share files with the
members of your class or some other logical group.</p></li><li><p>HTML: web server root directory.</p></li><li><p>CD: a share where CDs can be copied in order to be
shared back to client computers.</p></li><li><p>Default: skeleton files for creating new user home
directories are placed here.</p></li><li><p>Rebuild: share for storing images of client
workstations for rebuilding purposes.</p></li><li><p>More server configuration options, such as the
ability to configure the services which should run on a particular
server (i.e., dhcpd, Samba, Netatalk, Apache, Squid, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Monitor the status of services that have been
configured to run on each server. Possibly integrate the &ldquo;Big
Brother&rdquo; network monitoring tool, if its license allows.</p></li><li><p>Integration with Bruno Vernier's EDUML
standard.</p></li><li><p>Possible integration with the Roster project.
Roster is a server configuration system designed for
college/university applications. It contains methods for updating
server types other than Linux.</p></li><li><p>Modularize (OOP!) the data layer (Roster has this
already and might be usable).</p></li><li><p>Extend the Squid proxy scan to scan the HTML files
in the Squid cache, matching files to URLs using the Squid
logs.</p></li><li><p>Ability to add users to multiple schools. Useful
for staff members who teach part time in two schools, or district
staff who may work in all schools in the district (this latter case
is a special one that should probably be handled
differently).</p></li><li><p>Generic configuration of system files such as Samba
configuration, Squid configuration, Netatalk configuration, network
configuration (dhcpd, IP masquerading, etc., using private IP
addresses).</p></li><li><p>Support for having &ldquo;backup&rdquo; k12admin-server
machines that synchronize their databases with the main
k12admin-server and can be used for automatic failover
protection.</p></li></ul></div>

systems. There is also a tar archive file for installing on other
systems.</p><p>There are two packages: k12admin-server and k12admin-client.
The k12admin-server package should be installed only on the
computer that will be the main account administration computer for
your district. The k12admin-client package should be installed on
every machine that will be updated from the k12admin-server
machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e24c50"></a>Installing k12admin-server</h2></div></div><p>The k12admin-server package contains the files necessary to
use a machine as the central account administration server.
Typically, you will want k12admin-server installed on only one
machine in your district. It is possible to install the
k12admin-client package on the same machine as the k12admin-server
package, although for security reasons this may not be desirable.
It would be better if the accounts on the server computer were
administered manually, so that students and staff members do not
have accounts on the server and are less likely to try mucking
around there.</p><p>Install the k12admin-server package by running</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dpkg -i k12admin-server*deb
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i k12admin-server*rpm
</pre>


(use <b  >-U</b> in place of <b  >-i</b> if
this is an upgrade) in the directory where you have stored the
package. If this is a first install, you will be told to run
<span   class="bold"><b>k12admin-server.setup</b></span> as root to
create the MySQL database. This file was placed in the /usr/bin/
directory when the package was installed, so it should be in your
path.
</p><p>If you are installing the package from a tar file, unpack the
archive, go (<span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span>) to the
k12admin-server* directory and run <b  >make install</b>
to install the package.</p><p>In order to create the MySQL database, you will need to enter
the root password of your MySQL server. Note that the MySQL root
password is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same as your normal root
password. You should have been prompted to enter a password for
your MySQL server when that package was installed. The script will
allow you to keep trying passwords until it succeeds. Just press
<b  >ENTER</b> if your MySQL root password is blank. If
this is the case, the k12admin-server package will prompt you for a
new password, as it is a grave security risk to have a blank MySQL
password.</p><p>The second password asked for by the k12admin-server.setup is
one for the k12 MySQL user. This user is used by the scripts to
connect to the MySQL database. You do not need to memorize this
password, as it is stored in the /etc/k12admin.MySQL.pass file
which is readable by the k12admin and www-data users only. You can
change this password at any time by rerunning the
k12admin-server.setup program.</p><p>Now you must configure Apache so it knows where the k12admin
files are located. Once Apache is configured and reloaded, you
should be able to access the account administration system at
<tt  >http://<i><tt>yourservermachine</tt></i>/k12admin/</tt>
from any web browser. Log in as user
<span   class="emphasis"><em>demoteacher</em></span> with <span   class="emphasis"><em>demopass</em></span>
as the password.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x1e253e0"></a>Apache Configuration</h2></div></div><p>I strongly recommend using
<span   class="bold"><b>apache-ssl</b></span>
(http://www.apache-ssl.org/) in order to encrypt packets between
your web browser and the k12admin-server. This is especially true
if there is potential for someone to be sniffing packets that are
being transmitted. The basic authentication that is part of the
HTTP standard is not encrypted, and your password can be grabbed
easily off every outgoing web request if you are not using a secure
server.</p><p>You must edit the Apache configuration files to enable the
account-administration system. Add the following lines to the
bottom of Apache's access.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Alias /k12admin/ /var/k12admin/web/
     ScriptAlias /k12admin-cgi/ /var/k12admin/webscripts/
     &lt;Directory /var/k12admin/&gt;
     AllowOverride AuthConfig
     &lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre><p>You might also have to change the user and group of the
Apache web server process. It may be set to &ldquo;nobody&rdquo; by default.
The web server process must have access to the database containing
sensitive account information. The password for accessing the
database is stored in /etc/k12admin.MySQL.pass and is readable by
only the www-data user and the k12admin group. It is, therefore,
necessary to have the Apache process running as www-data. This
account was created when k12admin-server was installed, if it
didn't already exist.
</p><p>To set the user and group of the Apache process, change the
following lines in Apache's httpd.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
User www-data
Group www-data
</pre><p>Reload Apache after making these changes. On Debian systems,
reload Apache by running
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/apache reload
</pre>


or
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/apache-ssl reload
</pre>


On Red Hat, run
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd reload
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x2137b28"></a>Installing k12admin-client</h2></div></div><p>The k12admin-client package contains the files necessary to
update a machine using information from the k12admin-server
machine.</p><p>Install the k12admin-client package by running:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">

(use <b  >-U</b> instead of <b  >-i</b> if you
are upgrading) in the directory where you have the package. If this
is an initial install, you will be asked to run
<span   class="bold"><b>k12admin-client.setup</b></span> as root.
</p><p>If you are installing the package from a tar file, unpack the
archive, go (<span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span>) to the
k12admin-client* directory and run <b  >make install</b>
to install the package.</p><p>You will be asked for the name of the k12admin-server and the
root password of that machine. The name of the k12admin-server can
be an IP address or a host name (as long as the host name can be
resolved to an IP address, of course). Once you supply the server's
host name, the post-installation script will try to connect to the
server using ssh to inform the server that it has a new client and
copy the client's ssh key to the server. The ssh program will ask
you for the root password of the server machine. The root password
is not stored anywhere by the post-installation script. If you ever
wish to connect your k12admin-client computer to a different
k12admin-server machine, simply rerun the
<span   class="bold"><b>k12admin-client.setup</b></span>
program.</p><p>After the post-installation script completes, the server will
take up to five minutes to notice the new client and register the
new ssh key. Configure the new client by using a web browser to
access the account administration system. From the main menu,
select &ldquo;Domain Tools&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Edit Servers&rdquo;. Your new client
should appear in the list of servers. Select your new client server
and click on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Edit Server</em></span> button, then
configure appropriately.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d33580.0x2138100"></a>Updating Files for Clients</h2></div></div><p>Every five minutes, the data in the MySQL database on the
server is converted to plaintext files which can be copied to the
clients and used to update their local files. This process is
accomplished by the /var/k12admin/scripts/server/k12.updateserver
script. This script is run by <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>
every five minutes as the k12admin user. It can also be run
manually, but it must be run by the k12admin user and not by root.
When this script is run, it generates several files in the
/var/k12admin/serverdata/ directory that are used by the clients.
This script also uses a lock file in the /var/k12admin/lock/
directory to prevent multiple instances of
<span   class="bold"><b>k12.updateserver</b></span> from running
simultaneously and to prevent clients from performing their updates
while the files are still being generated.</p><p>There is another key file in the /var/k12admin/serverdata/
directory, called &ldquo;setup&rdquo;. This file contains all the code used
for updating and auditing the clients. This file is copied to the
clients before the clients are updated, so do not edit this file on
the clients if you are trying to add new features&mdash;edit it on the
server.</p><p>On the client machines, updates are done once an hour. The
script that does the updating is /usr/bin/k12.updateclient. Since
this script must modify key system files, it is run as root from
the system crontab file.</p><p>If run interactively, this script executes
/var/k12admin/clientdata/setup with no command-line arguments. To
avoid any delay in the menu coming up, the rsync is not performed.
One option on the menu is to perform the rsync, if the latest data
from the server is desired.</p><p>If run with command-line arguments, the script first runs
rsync (using ssh as the transport agent) to sync all the files from
the /var/k12admin/serverdata/ directory on the server to the
/var/k12admin/clientdata/ directory on the client, then executes
/var/k12admin/clientdata/setup with the same command-line arguments
it received.</p><p>If the script is run without arguments, it will enter an
interactive mode and present a menu of options from which to pick.
It will also show progress information that is not displayed in the
batch (non-interactive) mode. In batch mode, the following
arguments can be supplied:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >k12.updateclient auto</b>: performs

data from the /var/k12admin/serverdata/ directory on the server to
the /var/k12admin/clientdata/ directory on the client. When setup
is run interactively, this syncing is not done before the menu is
brought up, so if you need the latest data from the server, choose
this option first.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span>: updates
the passwd, group, shadow, gshadow, smbpasswd, squid.auth and
apache.auth files, depending on the configuration of the
server.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>homedirs</b></span>: creates
new home directories and cleans up old ones. Old home directories
can either be left alone, deleted or moved to a temporary holding
area (/var/k12admin/oldhomedirs/) where they are deleted when they
are 30 days old.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>audit</b></span>: run a
security audit on the local server. This goes through various log
files and determines which accounts have been used. This
information is copied to the server, where it is added to the audit
table in the database, so any user can review where and when their
account has been used.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>atalktable</b></span>:
generates a mapping of AppleTalk nodes to AppleTalk computer
names.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>squid</b></span>: audit of
the Squid proxy authentication files.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>apache</b></span>: audit of
any authenticated access to an Apache web server.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>netatalk</b></span>: audit of
access to AppleTalk services (logins from a Macintosh
computer).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>samba</b></span>: audit of
access to Samba services (logins from a Windows
workstation).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>: audit of ssh
(secure shell) connections.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>squidmonitor</b></span>: not
really a security audit, this searches through the proxy logs for
any potentially inappropriate web browsing and also sends this
information back to the server computer for review by school
staff.</p></li></ul></div>

No changes will be made on the client computers until they have
been configured through the web interface. Default settings are all
&ldquo;off&rdquo;. For example, passwords are not updated and home
directories are not created. The k12admin-client servers are
configured from the Domain Tools Edit Servers menu option.
