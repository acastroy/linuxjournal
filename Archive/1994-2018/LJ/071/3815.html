average &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; for the system administrator. Although it
addresses some of the how-to's, it is more of a &ldquo;why-to&rdquo;. The
book is divided into 3 parts: Principles, Practicum and Services.
Throughout, administration principles are emphasized, followed by
practical suggestions.</p><p>Part I, Principles (chapters 1-7), starts out with a
discussion of &ldquo;The Prime Directive: to provide and maintain access
to system resources.&rdquo; In other words, why we are doing this job;
not just because it's fun, although it should be most of the time.
It goes back to the basic reason for the existence of computers&mdash;to
provide a service to the users. &ldquo;Requirements Analysis&rdquo; is then
examined to put some legs on the prime directive.</p><p>If you are responsible for your own Linux box at home or at
work, you might let &ldquo;Recovery Planning&rdquo; slip, but when you are
supporting the work of others in the enterprise, a recovery plan is
essential. Computers will fail. Users will make mistakes. How will
you respond? The authors present the interesting concept of a
rescue partition and an auto-rescue configuration to automate
recovery from some disasters, although they missed the opportunity
to identify just what constitutes &ldquo;a full suite of repair tools&rdquo;.
The experienced system administrator will know some, but the
beginners need more guidance. Numerous recovery issues are
discussed, including administrator error.</p><p>Too often we get caught up in a putting-out-files mode. The
chapter on capacity planning gives guidance in preventing fires.
Principles ends with a discussion of the Help Desk, Network
Computing and Security Policy.</p><p>Part II, Practicum (chapters 8-16), begins with the topic of
enforcing security. Certainly not an exhaustive treatment,
considering another recently published book has several hundred
pages on just this one subject, but fundamental topics are
addressed. Exploits and their consequences should have you thinking
of your recovery planning again. This chapter and most of the
following chapters end with a reading list citing relevant HOW-TOs
and many other books. Booting and shutdown reviews LILO, MILO and
SILO and the System V startup/shutdown rc scripts. If you need to
build a custom kernel, the chapter entitled &ldquo;Configuring and
Building Kernels&rdquo; gives some helpful hints. Everyone finds some
tasks repetitive. The chapter on scripting offers ideas in several
scripting languages.</p><p>There are two kinds of computer users: those who do backup,
and those who will. The Backup chapter discusses practical
solutions to the problem. Most computers are on a network today.
Networking Technologies discusses IPv4, IPv6 and related protocols.
This chapter has an extensive reading list.</p><p>Do you have several systems to support? Wish they all had the
same configuration? System Profiles gives good guidance here. This
chapter has the best discussion of disk partitioning theory I have
read&mdash;not just a set of recommended sizes, but why various branches
ought to be separated into their own partitions. Once you have a
partitioning plan, the OS has to be installed on all machines and
upgraded as necessary. Automated Installation and Upgrade discusses
some how-to guidelines, including Red Hat's
<span   class="bold"><b>kickstart</b></span>. User and Group
Administration appropriately follows.</p><p>Part III, Services (chapters 17-21), has 40 pages reviewing
network services, mail, printing and faxing, working with NFS and
managing NIS. Little nuggets of information are sprinkled
throughout.</p><p>Appendix A is something we hope we never need, but know we
must deal with: emergencies. It starts with the lost root password
and ends with some miscellaneous performance problems. Appendix A
is followed by a glossary, worth reading in that it's more of a
mini-encyclopedia than a dictionary. The index is huge for a book
this size (41 pages long), making it a valuable tool for using this
book as a reference.</p><p>Eric S. Raymond, writer of the book's Forward, says in a
review on its back cover, &ldquo;This book is a reference for the
experienced Linux administrators and a guide for new ones.&rdquo; I
heartily agree and recommend a thorough reading.</p></div></div>
