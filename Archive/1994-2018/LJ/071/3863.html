    Mr. Hynum talks to Tobin Maginnis of Sair Linux about his
    certification and training program.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e8580.0x14e0500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Sooner or later, like it or not, it had
to happen. The corporate &ldquo;suits&rdquo; have discovered Linux. Wall
Street went ga-ga over Red Hat, Inc. last August and swooned again
for VA Linux Systems in December. Predictably, some financial
analysts stood back and wrung their hands like fretful parents,
warning of the perils of puppy love, calling it a passing
infatuation. And they're partly right. The stock market is ever
fickle, and investors are always cruising for a fresh, new face.
</p><p>Professional pessimists aside, those in the know about Linux
and corporate America have no doubt the two were meant for each
other. The more pressing concern among the Linux faithful is that
free enterprise may compromise the Open Source movement and the
ideals it has long stood for.</p><p>Dr. Tobin Maginnis, a Linux devotee since its inception,
worries about that, too. As founder and president of Sair, Inc. of
Oxford, Mississippi, Maginnis has developed a certification program
aimed at moving Linux into the IT mainstream without sacrificing
its integrity. The program, called Sair Linux and GNU Certification
(SLGC), is unmatched in the industry for its breadth, depth and
scope, covering training and testing in all recognized
distributions. Best of all, it has the blessing of open source's
founding fathers&mdash;pioneers like Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond and
Bruce Perens, all of whom serve on Sair, Inc.'s board of
advisors.</p><p>Compaq
(<a href="http://www.compaq.com" target="_self">http://www.compaq.com/</a>),
the second largest computer manufacturer in the world, has already
signed on, partnering with Sair, Inc. to become a Sair Internal
Training Organization. John Wiley &amp; Sons
(<a href="http://www.wiley.com" target="_self">http://www.wiley.com/</a>)
is publishing SLGC test preparation materials and making them
available globally, and Sylvan Prometric
(<a href="http://www.sylvanprometric.com" target="_self">http://www.sylvanprometric.com/</a>),
the international leader in IT certification testing, is offering
SLGC exams at its testing facilities worldwide.</p><p>Other deals in the making include negotiations with a
strategic partner in South Korea to establish Sair Asia, which
would serve the emerging Pacific Rim markets including South Korea,
Japan and China.</p><p>And that's just for starters. Dr. Maginnis, a professor of
computer science and a Linux researcher at the University of
Mississippi in Oxford, told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The question is not what can or will Linux do for
corporate America. The fact is, Linux has been serving corporate
America for years. It's not uncommon to ask a CEO or CFO if their
company uses Linux and to have them respond, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; But ask their
IT department the same question, and the answer always seems to be
&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux is truly unique among operating systems in
that many corporations have already adopted it for internal use
without upper management's knowledge or approval. Production goals
and budgets are always in conflict, and management always expects
to be able to do more with the same resources. So a clever
programmer says, &ldquo;Hey, why don't we use that old Intel 486 we
replaced last month? I know Linux will run on it. We can set it up,
do a quick configure and finally get management off our backs.&rdquo;
That's more common than a lot of people realize.</p></blockquote></div><p>Only now, upper management is finally catching on, and
they're definitely not complaining.
</p><p>Maginnis caught on to open source's potential two decades ago
and became one of its earliest converts. When AT&amp;T released its
Version 6 UNIX to universities in the late '70s and early '80s,
Maginnis used it to teach operating systems in his classes at Ole
Miss. Between 1979 and 1983, he and colleague Don Miller developed
Thriftnet, a suite of networking programs for UNIX and other
operating systems, and the software was distributed free.</p><p>As open source evolved, Maginnis stayed abreast of every new
development, from Minix to FreeBSD, which he taught in
graduate-level courses. He began using Linux as a network server
and firewall in 1995. His current research topics include the
construction and integration of distributed operating system
components into the Linux kernel and the development of a
performance-oriented distributed operating system.</p><p>Besides his academic credentials, Maginnis is an experienced
businessman and entrepreneur. The seven-year-old Sair, Inc., a
custom software programming company, has developed more than 45
large computer graphic and simulation programs for Chicago-area
companies. Its client list includes Abbott Laboratories, Illinois
Superconductor, Siemens Medical Systems, Dade International and
Kraft General Foods.</p><p>A student gave Maginnis the idea for Linux certification in
1997:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One of my students stopped me in the hallway one
day and asked if there was a Linux certificate. There wasn't one,
but the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. The
problem was, enrollment in computer science programs had been on
the decline, but there was a strong demand for trained
professionals in the workplace. Vendor certificates were clearly
becoming a trend in the industry. It occurred to me that this was a
chance to do something real for the promotion and acceptance of
open-source software.</p></blockquote></div><p>The result was SLGC, aimed at providing the highest-quality
certification training material and exams in the industry. Sair's
efforts are focused on the continued development and distribution
of the most accurate, timely and progressive materials in the
constantly growing and evolving market.
</p><p>These materials cover the most popular and recent
distributions as well as regional variations for premium packages
offered to corporate clients, both in the U.S. and internationally.
The materials are offered through established training centers,
including New Horizons Computer Learning Centers Inc.
(<a href="http://www.newhorizons.com" target="_self">http://www.newhorizons.com/</a>)
and Productivity Point International
(<a href="http://www.propoint.com" target="_self">http://www.propoint.com/</a>),
as well as through independent facilities around the world. Exams
are available through Sylvan Prometric and VUE
(<a href="http://www.vue.com" target="_self">http://www.vue.com/</a>) in
more than 140 countries (for a sample exam, go to Sair's web site
at
<a href="http://www.linuxcertification.com" target="_self">http://www.linuxcertification.com/</a>).</p><p>In addition, Sair's self-study materials can be purchased
through traditional retail outlets such as Barnes &amp; Noble
bookstores and through Amazon.com.</p><p>Best of all, SLGC is structured to follow existing models of
professional continuing education and testing. Offered in four
levels, SLGC qualifies its graduates as administrators, engineers
and master engineers.</p><p>Purists need not be alarmed. SLGC is designed to serve the
needs of corporate America while advancing the cause of Linux
itself, a cause that remains dear to Maginnis' heart. &ldquo;Our
certification program is built, first and foremost, on a commitment
to the Linux community,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>According to Kevin Seddon, vice president of operations for
Sair, Inc., Linux certification is the obvious next step in the
Open Source movement's evolution:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>IT professionals have long recognized Linux for
its strengths&mdash;stability, flexibility and efficiency. Those are
valuable qualities in the corporate world as well, which is why
Linux is being seen as a viable alternative to Microsoft. Corporate
acceptance, in turn, means increased funding for open-source
research and development in order to meet the private sector's
needs. With major corporate clients on board, they will pour in the
resources. The possibilities are limitless.</p></blockquote></div><p>In addition, all the major computer manufacturers&mdash;IBM,
Compaq and Dell, to name a few&mdash;have made a major commitment to
Linux and open-source software. Most already sell machines with a
preinstalled Linux/GNU system. &ldquo;That's a clear sign of Linux's
initiation into the mainstream,&rdquo; Seddon said.
</p><p>Compaq, for example, has committed hundreds of millions of
dollars to Linux, putting it to work on their new X86 and Alpha
servers. Under the terms of Sair's partnership with Compaq, Sair
will provide corporate training (using Sair's materials) to Compaq
personnel and help develop new Linux-based training materials for
the X86 and Alpha ASE programs. &ldquo;Toward that end, Compaq and Sair,
Inc. will work together to expand Linux's capabilities, which, in
the long run, benefits the Linux community as a whole,&rdquo; Seddon
said.</p><p>Sair is also working closely with Linux user groups around
the world to hone and improve SLGC's knowledge matrix and
objectives. And, in the finest Linux tradition, Sair has pledged to
give back a percentage of its revenues to the Open Source community
to help fund additional research and development. Maginnis has
said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We recognize that the Linux phenomenon is the
result of many idealistic people who will never be paid for their
years of hard work. We think the best remedy to this situation is
to actively support the development of new open-source software.
It's common sense that if free software creates a special business
environment, that business should find a way to give back to the
Open Source community. Other companies have done that, and Sair
will do it, too.</p></blockquote></div><p>In that regard, Sair's plan is to identify and fund key
projects which will best serve the Linux movement. Possible
projects include creating anti-aliased fonts for X11 or creating a
grammar checker.
</p><p>Finally, Sair, Inc. is working to develop an international
consortium of universities and businesses actively involved in
open-source research and development. The goal is to create a
focused, structured and prioritized research network in which
researchers around the world share information and collaborate on
projects for the private and public sectors. Seldon said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This consortium would bring together many of
open-source's greatest minds&mdash;both in the public and private
sector&mdash;and help them work together to solve common problems. It
would attract more funding for research. It would help cut back on
duplication of effort. And it would provide an organizational
structure through which information can be shared and disseminated
more effectively and promptly.</p></blockquote></div><p>Maginnis and company are convinced that certification will be
the spark plug that fires the Linux engine in the coming years.
Certification is, simply put, skill validation, but it means more
than that. Certification sets criteria and standards that must be
met in order to serve the needs of the market. It's a focused,
results-oriented process which IT professionals are accustomed to
and which the business world expects. Seldon told me:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>That's the beauty of SLGC. It's a comprehensive
program created by someone inside the Linux community who has
successfully &ldquo;translated&rdquo; the process by working through
traditional outlets such as training facilities, testing facilities
and the corporate community. And, through our board of advisors,
some of the greatest names in the Open Source movement have
contributed to it.</p></blockquote></div>

Even so, Sair's work is just beginning. International Data Corp.
(IDC) research states that Linux was the fastest-growing server
operating environment in 1998, growing more than 190 percent in
that year alone and capturing more than 15.8 percent of the 4.4
million unit revenue shipment server operating systems market
segment. According to a December 10 article in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Los
Angeles Times</em></span>, many corporate investors sense the
potential for Linux to become the backbone of the Web. They also
believe it could play a significant role in providing the software
for the expected wave of new digital appliances, such as video
recorders and mobile computers.
</p><p>If that's the case, Sair, Inc. is uniquely positioned to meet
an ever-growing demand for IT professionals certified in Linux. In
conclusion, Maginnis said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>All the signs are that Linux certification is an
idea whose time has come. We are obviously excited about the
possibilities. At the same time, we recognize our responsibility to
the Linux community. We strongly believe in the ideals of the free
software system, and we plan to show our commitment to those ideals
in very tangible ways. For me, personally, it's been a privilege to
have worked within this community for 20 years and to watch Linux
evolve and thrive. There are a lot of unsung heroes out there who
made it happen and who will continue to make it happen. We look
forward to working with them in the future and doing our own small
part for Linux. We know we can't do it without them.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>
