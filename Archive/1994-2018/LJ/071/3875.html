    &ldquo;Of all the practical implements common to the Texas ranchman

world's most open and choice-rich technology market, does Red Hat
have Microsoft-grade market shares? If Linux distributions are
bottled water, why does Red Hat move so much more digital
H&lt;-&gt;2&lt;-&gt;O than Caldera, Debian, TurboLinux and the rest
of them?
</p><p>The answer, by acclaim, is that Red Hat has
<span   class="emphasis"><em>branded</em></span> itself better than anyone else. Okay,
it helped that Red Hat made installation of software easy with the
Red Hat Package Manager, now used by pretty much everybody. And
maybe it helped that Red Hat used Python as the scripting language
for their system-administration tools. But the prevailing
perception is that Red Hat is a branding success.</p><p>That success is extremely enviable. In fact, we are
witnessing a record tide of brand envy right now. The whole dot-com
world is gaga over this ancient and brutal marketing notion, and
Red Hat is offered as a huge case in point. Thanks to the success
of brands like Red Hat, branding is a huge marketing fad, fueled by
apparently limitless billions poured through startups and into the
media from swelling vats of venture capital.</p><p>This flood of dot-com advertising dollars is driving up the
price of traditional media and driving out the traditional
advertisers along with it. A billboard on Silicon Valley's Highway
101 now rents for upward of $100,000 per month: more than double
the price from just one year ago. Gone are ugly ads for car dealers
and office supply stores, replaced by artful ads for WhatEver.com,
which is no doubt branding itself.</p><p>This begs the question: just what is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>branding</em></span>, anyway?</p><p>Search for the subject at About.com, and you'll find links to
nearly three hundred pages, all but one of which is devoted to body
art (&ldquo;branding &amp; tattooing&rdquo;). The remaining page is a set of
marketing links, among which you won't find a word&mdash;or a link to a
word&mdash;about what branding is, where it came from, or why it's so
hot in the dot-com world.</p><p>The FAST search engine
(<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com" target="_self">http://www.alltheweb.com/</a>)
finds 1,699,630 pages with the word &ldquo;brand&rdquo; and 92,288 with the
word &ldquo;branding&rdquo;. Oddly, few of those pages are about artful skin
burns. Or maybe all of them are. Because both brand and branding
come to marketing from the cattle business, by way of the first
company to adopt the term &ldquo;brand&rdquo;, and the one that still
understands it best: Procter &amp; Gamble. From that company's
history page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>P&amp;G's brand management system began to take
shape in the late 1920s. In 1931, Neil McElroy, the Company's
Promotion Department Manager, created a marketing organization
based on competing brands managed by dedicated groups of people.
The system provided more specialized marketing strategies for each
brand and Procter &amp; Gamble's brand management system was
born.</p></blockquote></div><p>This development coincided with the birth of commercial
broadcasting, which P&amp;G did much to fund and define. In 1923,
P&amp;G's Crisco was one of the first radio program sponsors. In
1933, P&amp;G's Oxydol sponsored the radio serial &ldquo;Ma Perkins&rdquo;.
By sponsoring other shows with other detergents, P&amp;G helped
create the label &ldquo;soap opera&rdquo;.
</p><p>In 1948, McElroy took over as president of Procter &amp;
Gamble. By then, P&amp;G was already what they still call
themselves today: the world's top branding company. P&amp;G now has
over three hundred brands, dozens of which are #1 or #2 in their
categories: Tide, Cheer, Vicks, Pringles, Crest, Pampers, Tampax,
Ivory and Clearasil are all P&amp;G brands. What makes them brands
is the fact that their identities have been burned into our
brains.</p><p>Brand management isn't for cowboys. It's a military job.
Companies like P&amp;G are in a constant battle for shelf space,
often pitting the company's own brands against each other. Because
the fundamental nature of that battle has not changed for
generations, the principles of branding have long since been
proven. Always show the package in the first eight seconds of a TV
commercial. Always repeat the name at least five times. Always
promise a benefit.</p><p>When an advertising campaign breaks the rules, the rules it
breaks are the ones P&amp;G still teaches&mdash;along with the secrecy,
the protectiveness, the paranoia, the company song (yes, like IBM,
they have one) and all the other varieties from the canons of brand
management.</p><p>While it's safe to say that most dot-com marketing folks
don't come from this kind of mindset, it is also untrue. Marketing
has always modeled itself on warfare. The verb &ldquo;market&rdquo; is a
transitive verb. It acts on a direct object. Since markets tend to
be competitive and we conceive competition as a kind of warfare, it
is no surprise that marketing is thick with military thinking. In
&ldquo;Marketing Warfare&rdquo;, Al Ries and Jack Trout write,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The true nature of marketing today is not serving
the customer; it is outwitting, out-fighting and out-flanking your
competitors. In short, marketing is war where competition is the
enemy and the customer is the ground to be won.</p></blockquote></div><p>No wonder so much marketing treats customers like dirt.
</p><p>Most of marketing and branding rhetoric today is of a kinder,
gentler sort. But it is also kind of vague. &ldquo;Identity, personality
and reputation, while related, are not synonymous,&rdquo; one
correspondent wrote to me. &ldquo;Branding encompasses parts of all of
them.&rdquo; Buzzwords are like that. They encompass, but they don't
define.</p><p>If you can't define what you mean, at least use a good
metaphor. That's something Red Hat's Bob Young has always done very
well. In his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Under the Radar</em></span>, he
writes,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Our goal had always been to become the Heinz
ketchup of the Linux world&mdash;low-cost, high-quality, reliable and
predictable.</p></blockquote></div><p>Bob Frankel, whose Big Time Branding site
(<a href="http://www.frankel-anderson.com" target="_self">http://www.frankel-anderson.com/</a>)
ranks high on most searches for branding, has this definition of
the subject:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Branding is not about getting your prospect to
choose you over your competition; it's about getting your prospect
to see you as the only solution.</p></blockquote></div>

Clearly, Red Hat does that, and they do it in a way that works in
the Open Source world, where there are plenty of other equally
appetizing varieties of ketchup.
</p><p>Again, why? I think it has to do with trust. My old partner
David Hodskins once defined brand as &ldquo;the capitalized value of the
trust that exists between a company and its customers.&rdquo; As I write
this, the capitalized value of Red Hat is $14,632,710,582, give or
take the few hundred million Red Hat gains or loses on any given
day. That's a lot of trust.</p><p>It so happens that natives of the Open Source world put a
very high value on trust. You earn that trust (as you do anywhere)
by being as open and honest as possible. I believe this is manifest
in the high market valuations of highly trusted Linux companies.
Agreed: the stock market is a very different place than the market
for open-source code. But the stock market is also proving to be
highly intuitive. It assigned high valuations to Netscape, Yahoo!
and other Internet stocks long before the rest of the business
world realized that the Net truly was going to goose up the whole
economy. And now it is doing the same with Linux stocks.</p><p>What do they trust? It's more than just a few Linux brands.
It's the explosive potential of what can't be owned, but can be
shared.</p><p>So maybe Red Hat succeeded because it was on the radar all
along.</p></div></div>
