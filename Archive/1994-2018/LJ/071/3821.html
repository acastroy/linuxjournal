GNU/Linux</em></span> is well-organized and well-written. The
author, Bill McCarty, is an associate professor of computer science
and obviously knows his stuff. The layout is well-done, and not
filled with cutesy graphics to distract the eye.</p><p>Many books geared for the Linux newbie have come out in the
past year&mdash;most of them try to stay vendor-neutral. This book
follows the recent trend of focusing on one distribution, in this
case, Debian. I actually like this trend, as many newbies are
confused when presented with variations in the different
distributions, so sticking to one should make discussion clearer
and shorten the learning curve for some. Also, Debian is not the
easiest of distributions to install and use, so a book devoted to
it is deserved.</p><p>This book contains a goodly amount of information, and not
all of it is for the newbie. It is truly a guide to the entire
system, not just an introduction. While introductory material such
as a history of Linux, installing, configuring, definitions, etc.
is presented, much more complex operations, such as setting up both
a local (LAN) and a wide-area (WAN) network, are also
described.</p><p>The material is presented in a straightforward manner, using
clear, easy-to-understand language. However, I did feel the book
was written with the computer-literate reader in mind. Even though
he defines basics such as &ldquo;what is an operating system&rdquo;, it still
reads as if he expects you to already know. Indeed, he tells you
how to get information you will need to install Linux by using your
MS Windows menus.</p><p>Mr. McCarty devotes entire chapters to user administration
and X configuration, as well as networking. His desktop of choice
is GNOME, and it too receives a chapter. Also included are chapters
on games and connecting to the Internet. The appendices include a
Linux directory tree, the principal Linux files, Debian utilities
and a Linux Command Quick Reference. A CD-ROM containing the Debian
2.1 distribution is bound into the book.</p><p>The book is not without its faults. One amusing mishap is in
Chapter 4. An introduction to useful Linux programs states that you
will learn the simple text editor
<span   class="bold"><b>pico</b></span>, then the author proceeds to
teach you the simple text editor
<span   class="bold"><b>ae</b></span>. Guess he changed his
mind.</p><p>Overall, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Debian GNU/Linux</em></span> is a
complete reference guide to this distribution, and well worth
adding to your collection of Linux books.</p></div></div>
