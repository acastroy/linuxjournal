The Distributed Security
Infrastructure lets you create disjoint virtual security zones on a
physical Linux cluster.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12de558"></a></h2></div></div><p>
An increasing number of projects use Linux and other open-source
software as basic building blocks to create
clusters. Examples range from clusters that perform massive
computations of visual effects for movies to
clusters used as next-generation telecommunication servers.
</p><p>
More and more often, various issues, including economics,
management and flexibility, require applications
to run on the same physical cluster.
An illustration of this situation in the telecom world is carrier-grade
clustered servers shared among different operators. The operators share
the global infrastructure of the cluster and provide different services
to their clients but want to keep their binaries and data
private. In such cases, cluster administrators
do not have access to the source code for these applications, and
security mechanisms cannot be enforced at the source code
level. Hence, a security infrastructure is needed to ensure that
a given application's resources cannot be tampered with or used by
other entities on the cluster.
</p><p>
The Distributed Security Infrastructure (DSI) provides a solution for such
a situation. It attempts to build
a coherent security framework dedicated to carrier-grade Linux clusters by
dividing a cluster into several virtual
subclusters, guaranteeing controlled/restricted connections between
them. Even though the project is only in its second year of design and
development, we believe DSI is a useful tool for cluster
administrators. This article presents how to use DSI to set virtual security zones
inside a Linux cluster.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12de710"></a>
DSI Architecture and DSI Tools</h2></div></div><p>
In this section, we briefly introduce DSI's architecture. DSI is
composed of one security server (SS) and multiple security managers
(SMs), one per node (Figure 1). The SS centralizes management of the
cluster: it gathers alarms and warnings sent by SMs and propagates a
unique security policy over the cluster. On the other hand, SMs are
responsible for enforcing security on their own nodes. Furthermore,
messages are exchanged between the SS and SMs over encrypted and
authenticated channels, using SSL/TLS over CORBA event channels.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6803f1.large.jpg"><img src="6803f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The DSI Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
Security mechanisms in DSI are implemented at the process level to check
the access privileges a process has to a resource. Each process is
identified by its security context identifier (ScID) and the node identification
on which it is running (SnID).
</p><p>
SnIDs are assigned using the DSI SetNodeID tool. All processes sharing the same
security context are assigned the same
ScID. ScIDs can be assigned automatically by the system
according to DSP rules (see below), or they can be assigned
specifically to a given binary using the DSI SetSID tool. This
allows grouping of binaries according to their security contexts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12dea80"></a>
The DSP Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
In DSI, writing a security policy for the cluster consists of granting
or denying permissions to a given SnID and ScID pair. These rules are
valid for the whole cluster. All rules are centralized in an XML file
on the SS to ease management.
</p><p>
DSI provides a way to update and
enforce transparently and automatically a unique homogeneous view of the whole cluster's
security. Once the administrator modifies existing rules or adds a new
rule to the distributed security policy (DSP), the DSP must be loaded on the SS using the
dsiUpdatePolicy tool. Then, dsiUpdatePolicy checks the DSP file
against our DSP XML schema (syntactical checks). If the DSP is
validated, the SS propagates the new rules to all nodes of the cluster
using the secure communication channels. Finally, each SM enforces the
rules at kernel level calling the distributed security module
(DSM, see Figure 2). DSM is based on the LSM kernel patch. Its detailed
description is beyond the scope of this article; see the on-line
Resources section for links to more information.

Distributed Access Control</h2></div></div><p>
Controlling access to local resources is rather simple: the DSM module
retrieves the local ScID and SnID of the requesting process and checks
corresponding permissions in the security rules.
Actually, the originality of DSI lies in distributed access control.
Currently, only socket communications are implemented. To illustrate this,
we detail the access control mechanisms when a process tries to access a
resource located on another node (Figure 3):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The access request first is intercepted by the local DSM, which
checks that the process has the privilege to call locally the socket-related
systems calls.
</p></li><li><p>
Then, the ScID and SnID of the requesting process are added by
DSM to each IP packet sent to the remote node.
</p></li><li><p>
On the receiving node, the remote DSM uses the ScID and SnID of
the requesting process, extracted from the IP packet, to check its permission
to communicate with both the target socket and the process to which
the target socket belongs.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, the remote DSM locally checks that the process to which
the target socket belongs may receive information from the
requesting process.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6803f3.large.jpg"><img src="6803f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12df370"></a>
The Problem</h2></div></div><p>
In this section, we walk through a simple scenario, which presents a
problem and explains how DSI can help solve it.
Say we want to share a cluster of two nodes (we
begin small), among two telecommunication operators, PhoneMania and
RingBell, each running their own applications on the cluster's
nodes. Both offer a phone quotation service: end users call
entry point servers (using TelecomClient) and request quotes for
given companies. The entry point servers (PhoneManiaEP and RingBellEP)
forward the requests to their back-end servers (PhoneManiaBE and
RingBellBE), which retrieve the quotes and send them back to the
end user.
</p><p>
From a cluster operational point of view, the problem is the
following: how can we prevent a PhoneMania application from
forwarding its requests to RingBell's back-end servers? Without any
specific security infrastructure, PhoneMania could do so when its
back-end server is overloaded or simply when it does not have the
requested information&mdash;not to mention more aggravated scenarios of
subscriber's data theft or intentional harm meant for competitors and so
on. To illustrate such a scenario, we implemented all actors as simple UDP
client and server applications (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6803f4.large.jpg"><img src="6803f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Simple Telecom Scenario
</p></div></div><p>
Here is the fraud scenario step by step:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
PhoneMania and RingBell launch their back-end servers
on a node called munster:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[munster demo]$ ./RingBellBE -h 10.1.1.2 -p 9001
RINGBELL: bind on 10.1.1.2:9001
..
[munster demo]$ ./PhoneManiaBE -h 10.1.1.2
-p 8801
PHONEMANIA: bind on 10.1.1.2:8801
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Then, as PhoneMania is overloaded, he decides to use
RingBell's resources. So, on node colby, the entry point
server of PhoneMania (port 8800) forwards
all requests from his customers to RingBell's back-end servers (port 9001):

<pre     class="programlisting">
[colby demo]$ ./PhoneManiaEP -h 10.1.1.1
-p 8800 -b 10.1.1.2 -r 9001
PHONEMANIA: bind on 10.1.1.1:8800
PHONEMANIA: connect on 10.1.1.2:9001
..
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
When a client requests a quotation at PhoneMania's entry
point (port 8800), PhoneMania actually uses RingBell's
back-end server to answer (port 9001). Simply put, PhoneMania
gets paid by using RingBell's resources:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[colby demo]$ ./TelecomClient -h 10.1.1.1
-p 8800
Connecting to : 10.1.1.1:8800

</pre>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To prevent this, we propose to subdivide the shared cluster
securely into disjoint zones with DSI. Next, we show step by step
how to use DSI to do this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12dfaa8"></a>
Installing and Configuring DSI</h2></div></div><p>
First, we need to install DSI on all nodes of the cluster. After
downloading the latest DSI tarball from SourceForge (see Resources), DSI should compile
on your machine, as it uses the standard configure and make
strategy. We detail how to build and install DSI in the DSI
documentation found on the SourceForge site.
</p><p>
You should run the Security Manager on each node. For our two-node
cluster, this means it runs on colby and munster:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[colby]$ cd ~/dsi
[colby]$ source dsi_setup.sh
[colby]$ ~/dsi/bin/dsiSecManager
</pre>
</p><p>
To simplify, colby also acts as a security
server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[colby]$ cd ~/dsi
[colby]$ source dsi_setup.sh
[colby]$ ~/dsi/bin/dsiSecServer
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d65a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The SS and SMs communicate with each other using CORBA event channels.
</p><p>
We load the DSI kernel module DSM on each node to enforce security at
the kernel level:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ~/dsi/lsm
$ su root
Password:
# ./load
# /sbin/lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by    Not tainted
dsm                    36332   0 (unused)
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, we configure DSI by defining different IP addresses used on each
node for secure and nonsecure communications. To do so, we wrote a
tool called DciInit; see the DSI documentation at the SourceForge site for more details on the format
of the dci_policy.conf file and how to use DciInit:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ~/dsi/user/tools
$ ./DciInit ~/dsi/etc/dci_policy.conf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d6808"></a>
The Solution: Setting Up the Virtual Subclusters</h2></div></div><p>
Basically, to create disjoint virtual subclusters, you need to assign
different ScIDs to PhoneMania's resources (in our example, ScID=10)
and RingBell's resources (ScID=20). Then, add new rules to DSP to
restrict any connection from the zone defined by ScID 10 to the zone
defined by ScID 20 and vice versa. By organizing the resources of each
operator in separate groups, without any possible connection between
them, we actually achieve a virtual subdivision of the
cluster. Additionally, the administrator can create another zone
defined by ScID 30 with privileges to access both subclusters for
administrative purposes.
</p><p>
First, let's assign the ScIDs of each binary on each node (using
the DSI SetSID tool):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ~/dsi/user/tools/SetSID PhoneManiaEP 10
Changing from SID 0 to SID 10
$ ~/dsi/user/tools/SetSID PhoneManiaBE 10
Changing from SID 0 to SID 10
$ ~/dsi/user/tools/SetSID RingBellEP 20
Changing from SID 0 to SID 20
$ ~/dsi/user/tools/SetSID RingBellBE 20
Changing from SID 0 to SID 20
$ ~/dsi/user/tools/ls_dsi .
PERMISSION      USER    GROUP   BSID  FILE
-rwxr-xr-x      lmcaxpr install 10    PhoneManiaBE
-rwxr-xr-x      lmcaxpr install 20    RingBellBE
-rwxr-xr-x      lmcaxpr install 10    PhoneManiaEP
-rwxr-xr-x      lmcaxpr install 20    RingBellEP
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d69c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When DSM is loaded, it enforces default permissive security rules. To
achieve cluster subdivision, we have to edit the DSP file
~/dsi/etc/SampleDSP.xml and replace all the existing security rules with
our own.
</p><p>
PhoneMania's sockets are assigned ScID=10, and RingBell uses
ScID=20. The following rule assigns ScID=10 to PhoneMania's
entry point UDP socket (port 8800):

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;class_SOCKET_INIT_rule&gt;
  &lt;protocol&gt;UDP&lt;/protocol&gt;
  &lt;port&gt;8800&lt;/port&gt;
  &lt;SnID&gt;ALL&lt;/SnID&gt;
  &lt;ScID&gt;10&lt;/ScID&gt;
&lt;/class_SOCKET_INIT_rule&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d6b78"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We need three other similar rules: one for PhoneMania's back-end server
and two others for ScID=20 for RingBell.
</p><p>
Then, PhoneMania's processes (source ScID=10) are allowed to
create, send or receive messages on sockets they own
(that is, with target ScID=10):

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;class_SOCKET_rule&gt;
  &lt;sScID&gt;10&lt;/sScID&gt;
  &lt;sSnID&gt;ALL&lt;/sSnID&gt;
  &lt;tScID&gt;10&lt;/tScID&gt;
  &lt;tSnID&gt;ALL&lt;/tSnID&gt;
  &lt;allow&gt;CREATE CONNECT LISTEN RECEIVE SEND&lt;/allow&gt;
&lt;/class_SOCKET_rule&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d6d30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Create a similar rule for RingBell's processes.
</p><p>
Of course, communication between ScID=10 and 20 must be denied.
This is done simply by setting no socket permissions at all
between those ScIDs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;class_SOCKET_rule&gt;
  &lt;sScID&gt;10&lt;/sScID&gt;
  &lt;sSnID&gt;ALL&lt;/sSnID&gt;
  &lt;tScID&gt;20&lt;/tScID&gt;
  &lt;tSnID&gt;ALL&lt;/tSnID&gt;
  &lt;allow&gt;&lt;/allow&gt;
&lt;/class_SOCKET_rule&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d6ee8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Create a similar rule between source ScID=20 and target ScID=10.
</p><p>
Back-end and entry point servers of a given operator may be
located on different nodes of a cluster; remember, we're sharing a
cluster, not dedicating one node to RingBell and another to
PhoneMania. Hence, processes of PhoneMania (source ScID=10) must be
able to communicate with other PhoneMania processes (target
ScID=10) through the network. The same holds true for RingBell:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;class_NETWORK_rule&gt;
  &lt;sScID&gt;10&lt;/sScID&gt;
  &lt;sSnID&gt;ALL&lt;/sSnID&gt;
  &lt;tScID&gt;10&lt;/tScID&gt;
  &lt;tSnID&gt;ALL&lt;/tSnID&gt;
  &lt;deny&gt;NETWORK_RECEIVE&lt;/deny&gt;
&lt;/class_NETWORK_rule&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, PhoneMania (ScID=10) and RingBell
(ScID=10) processes usually are launched from a shell (default ScID=2).
So, basically, we need to allow the shell to create a new
process. This is done with a transition rule:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;class_TRANSITION_rule&gt;
  &lt;parent_ScID&gt; 2 &lt;/parent_ScID&gt;
  &lt;SnID&gt;ALL&lt;/SnID&gt;
  &lt;binary_ScID&gt;10&lt;/binary_ScID&gt;
  &lt;new_ScID&gt;10&lt;/new_ScID&gt;
&lt;/class_TRANSITION_rule&gt;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d7150"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The binary_ScID is the ScID explicitly assigned to the binary. Remember, we assigned ScIDs to PhoneManiaBE or PhoneManiaEP using
SetSID. The new_ScID is the ScID assigned to the new process
also created. As access to sockets 8800 and 8801 is granted only to
ScID=10, for PhoneMania, the new process should be assigned ScID=10.
A similar rule for RingBell should be created.
</p><p>
This is all we need in the DSP&mdash;12 security rules. Then, we
update the security policy in the whole cluster by sending an update
event to the security server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[colby]$ cd ~/dsi/SS/test/demoSecOM
[colby]$ ./dsiUpdatePolicy ~/dsi/etc/DSP.xml
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d7308"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The security server reads the updated DSP file (located in
~/dsi/etc/DSP.xml) and displays warnings if there are syntax errors.
Finally, it automatically sends updates to each security manager; no
need to log in to each machine to update the security policy manually
or develop your own version of system management Perl-based
software. This feature can be a benediction when you have a cluster of hundreds of nodes
physically spread out around the world (think grid computing).
</p><p>
Now, it's time to try the case again in which PhoneMania
forwards requests to RingBell's back-end server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[colby demo]$ ./TelecomClient  -h 10.1.1.1 -p 8800
Requesting quotation for Ericsson
Quote Ericsson
...
[colby demo]$ ./PhoneManiaEP -h 10.1.1.1 -p 8800
-b 10.1.1.2 -r 9001
PHONEMANIA: bind/connect on 10.1.1.1:8800 = 0
PHONEMANIA: bind/connect on 10.1.1.2:9001 = 0
Quote Ericsson

Quotation request received
...
[munster demo]$ ./RingBellBE -h 10.1.1.2 -p 9001
RINGBELL: bind on 10.1.1.2:9001
...
</pre>
</p><p>
On the other node (munster), we notice that RingBell's back-end server
is no longer handling PhoneMania's requests, although PhoneMania
illicitly redirects them to RingBell. You can use logs
generated by DSI, located in /var/log/messages to trace illicit requests:


<pre     class="programlisting">
May  6 07:47:31 munster kernel: DSI-LSM MODULE -
dsi_sock_rcv_skb check permission sscid 10
ssnid 1 tscid 20
May  6 07:47:31 munster kernel: DSI-LSM MODULE
Error - dsi_sock_rcv_skb - No Permission
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e6580.0x12d7570"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
We have shown a practical solution for sharing a cluster securely among
different applications belonging to different users. The DSI Project
allows users to create disjoint security zones
for each application in the cluster easily. Once DSI is installed on the
cluster, the effort needed to create a new security zone for new
applications scales down to setting appropriate ScIDs to binaries and
including corresponding rules in the DSP file. Source code
modification is not required and probably would be impossible
anyway.
