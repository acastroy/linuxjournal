Although it may be tempting to blame faulty software, incomplete
patches or inadequate monitoring
when security is breached on the Internet, a network or a personal
computer, we must remember the part we ourselves play in computer
security.
</p><p>
Internet security is the focus of this month's issue; back in the April
2004
issue, we looked at application and intranet security. More articles
discussing these and other aspects of security can be found on the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site. For an overview of how
Linux and open-source software are meeting the security requirements of
government agencies, read &ldquo;Open Source Innovation within the
DoD&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7644" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7644</a>) and &ldquo;GNU/Linux Clears Procurement
Hurdles&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7678" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7678</a>). Both articles are part of
Tom Adelstein's Web column, Linux in Government. Keeping track of
government's standing on Linux and open source is important, especially
considering the warning issued this past summer by one government
agency&mdash;the United States Computer Emergency Readiness
Team&mdash;&ldquo;advising
people to use a different Web browser&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If you are looking to enhance security on your home or small
office network, putting a firewall in place is a good
start. But, you knew that and you probably already have one. How
about something a little more interesting&mdash;something that could turn
into a nice little DIY project? In &ldquo;Building a Diskless 2.6
Firewall&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7383" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7383</a>), author Christian Herzog explains how
you can salvage some minimal hardware, replace the hard drive with a
CompactFlash (CF) card and employ BusyBox to build a machine with an
&ldquo;iptables firewall, SSH d&aelig;mon, DHCP server and DNS
server&rdquo;. Christian's
tutorial walks you through choosing the right software, selecting the
best filesystem for the CF card, compiling the 2.6 kernel, filling
the filesystem and booting with GRUB.

We all know that one important component of computer security is being
prepared and able to recover when something goes wrong, as it always
does on some level. A large part of one's ability to recover depends on
the quality of the data backups, yet backups don't always rank high on
people's to-do list. In fact, Phil Moses, author of &ldquo;Open-Source Backups
Using Amanda&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7422" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7422</a>), notes, &ldquo;Data probably
is the most important element in computing, but in too many cases I see
data backups overlooked or approached in such a carefree manner that I
shiver.&rdquo; To this end, Phil focuses his article on Amanda, explaining how
its ability to take on multiple configurations and multiple backup tape
devices, &ldquo;while requiring a minimum amount of time and
resources&rdquo; makes
it an ideal backup solution.

Finally, for something a little different, check out Marco Tabini's
article &ldquo;PHP as a General-Purpose Language&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6627" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6627</a>). Using a PHP-based news aggregator
script as an example, Marco demonstrates how the command-line version
of PHP can &ldquo;perform complex shell operations, such as manipulating data
files, reading and parsing remote XML documents and scheduling
important tasks through cron.&rdquo;
