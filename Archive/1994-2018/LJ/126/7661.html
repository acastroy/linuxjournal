This financial firm decided to build its own redundant WAN routers.
Here's a no-nonsense look at the tricky parts and how it all worked.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last summer, the investment company I work for decided to build a
disaster recovery site. This location, 40 miles from New York City,
would provide a mirror of our Downtown Manhattan operation. We decided
to utilize Linux as much as possible for this project for the following
reasons:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
We primarily are a Linux operation already, so we could use our
existing experience.
</p></li><li><p>
We could customize the configuration as much as we wanted, because
everything would be open source.
</p></li><li><p>
We hoped Linux solutions would be less expensive than other
solutions, such as Cisco's.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In this article, I focus on our use of Linux in wide-area network (WAN) routers. I define a WAN router
as a system that connects to both wide-area links,
such as T1 or T3 lines, and local-area networks, such
as 100baseT, and forwards packets between the two
networks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0c6b8"></a>
Network Design</h2></div></div><p>
We purchased dedicated connections because this is a disaster recovery
site and we need the connections to be as reliable as possible. Based
on our calculations, one T3 (45Mb/sec) and four T1 (1.544Mb/sec each)
lines would provide sufficient bandwidth for our operations. Ultimately, we
decided to use the T3 link as the primary connection and leave the T1s
as a bonded 5.7Mb/sec backup link.
</p><p>
The choice of WAN connectivity determined our network design. For
redundancy, we installed two WAN routers at each site. The routers are
identical and contain hardware to connect to both the T1 and T3 links.
With the use of splitter hardware, we hoped to connect all the WAN links
to all the routers, as shown in Figure 1. However, that design ultimately turned
out to be extremely difficult to implement, due to technical issues I
discuss below.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7661f1.large.jpg"><img src="7661f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Redundant WAN Links
</p></div></div><p>
In addition to the WAN links, we also connected the remote site to the
Internet through the hosting company backbone. We operated on the principle
that more connectivity was better, and this turned out to be useful
when we were designing the network. There's nothing like accidentally
bringing down your T3 with a mistyped command to make you appreciate a
back door to your routers over the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0ca28"></a>
Hardware Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
Our space for servers at the hosting company was limited to one standard
rack. This put space at a premium, because we needed to install a lot of
servers. Thus, we decided to use 1U systems for the WAN
routers. This was a difficult decision to make, as hardware options are
limited in that form factor. In retrospect, it would have
been much easier to use 2U systems for the WAN routers.
</p><p>
The next step was the selection of T1 and T3 interface
cards. The main choice here is whether to use a card
with an integrated channel service unit/data service
unit (CSU/DSU) that connects directly to the incoming
WAN circuit or a card with a high-speed serial
connection along with a standalone CSU/DSU. Given our
space constraints, an integrated card made the most
sense. In previous WAN installations, we
used Cisco 2620 router boxes with T1 cards installed.
However, that was not appropriate for this project
because we wanted to connect multiple T1 and T3 lines.
</p><p>
After much searching, the only vendor we found that could supply both
T3 and multiport T1 cards was SBE, Inc. The market for these cards is
small and the number of vendors is limited. My suggestion for finding
WAN cards is to start asking tech support a lot of questions and see
how they respond. Also, carefully look over the driver and hardware
specs before committing to a particular vendor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0cbe0"></a>
Designing the Router Computers</h2></div></div><p>
With the T3 and four T1 cards from SBE, we would require a system with two
free full-height, half-length PCI slots. We decided on Tyan S5102
motherboards with a single Pentium 4 Xeon 2.4GHz CPU. For memory, we
used 256MB of ECC RAM for maximum reliability.
</p><p>
To cut down on the chance of system failure, we used Flash-based IDE
devices. We found a device from SimpleTech that connects and operates
like a conventional hard drive. We decided on a 256MB device as we
thought that would be enough room for Fedora Core 1 to operate.
</p><p>
The complete computer systems (minus the WAN cards) were purchased from
a white box system supplier. This proved troublesome, though, as the supplier
was not able to produce four completely identical systems. The systems
had variations in CPU fan manufacturers and memory speeds.
</p><p>
One area where the system supplier was helpful was in finding the
right case. Only one of the numerous system vendors I contacted could
supply a motherboard and case combination that could hold two
full-height PCI cards. We had hoped to use a stock system from a
supplier such as Dell or IBM, but none of the big names could give us
a system that matched all our criteria.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0cdf0"></a>
Circuits and Cabling</h2></div></div><p>
It's critical to have redundant circuits connecting an office to a
backup site. Determine who serves your sites and find a backup site
served by multiple providers. Our office is connected physically to
two providers, so we ended up ordering the T3 from one and the T1s
from the other. If you don't research carefully which providers have
actual physical connections to your sites, you are likely to end up
with all your circuits running through one vendor's cable at some
point.
</p><p>
T1s come on standard RJ-45 cables. Typically, the provider terminates
the T1s&mdash;and their responsibility&mdash;at your demarcation point (demarc).
The demarc generally is where all your phone connections are made. From
the demarc, it is a simple matter to run regular Ethernet cables to your
racks.
</p><p>
T3s are more complicated. The physical connection is two coaxial
cables, one for transmit and one for receive. T3s use RG-59A cable
with BNC connectors. The T3 provider informed us that our server room
was too far from its equipment in our building, so a T3 repeater was
necessary. This required 4U of space and a 120-volt outlet in our
rack. Luckily, this distance flaw wasn't repeated at the hosting facility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0cfa8"></a>
Splitting the Circuits</h2></div></div><p>
Our goal was to connect all circuits to all WAN routers (Figure
1) and leave the circuits turned off on the spare system on each
end. One router at each end would be the master for the T3, and the
other would be the master for the four T1s. If either router
failed, the circuits could be brought up on the other router.
</p><p>
Based on our research, in particular, some of Cisco's high-end telco
equipment, we knew that splitting the circuits was possible. The key
constraint is only one system on each end can be transmitting and
receiving at a time. That turned out to be a large problem because
SBE's hardware was not designed to be inactive while connected to a
line. The critical flaw was the transmitter on the T3 cards
automatically turns on when power is applied to the card. So, if you
have the T3 circuit up running between two systems, one on each end,
and you power-cycle the spare system on one end, the T3 goes down
because both systems on one end are trying to transmit. This can be
worked around partially by sending a shutoff command to the transmitter
on the card. This isn't possible until the machine is loaded and the OS
is installed, a potential delay of several minutes.
</p><p>
We also discovered that the T3 signals on the coaxial cables must be
impedance-matched. The impedance on a T3 cable is 75 ohms. If
you simply
split that connection, the impedance on the two resulting cables is 37.5
ohms, which may or may not work, depending on your hardware. The
correct way to split T3 cables is to use what's called a power
splitter, which contains a transformer to balance the
impedance properly at 75 ohms on all connections. We used passive power
splitters from Micro Circuits, Inc.
</p><p>
Splitting the T1s was much simpler. It's sufficient to use
RJ-45 tee connectors to turn one incoming cable into two outgoing
cables. Also, the SBE 4T1 card is designed to not turn on the transmitter
until the driver is loaded, so you can share the connection between
systems.
</p><p>
We were able to make all these split connections work. However, due to
the startup problems with the T3 cards and other issues, we currently do
not have the splitters installed. If you want to try doing this step, you
have to get everything working rock solid without splitting before even
attempting it. Otherwise, you will be removing the
splitters every time there is a problem with a circuit because you won't
have confidence in your setup.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0d268"></a>
Rolling Our Own Distro</h2></div></div><p>
The choice of a 256MB Flash drive for storage dictated a compact
OS install. At Telemetry, we have standardized on Fedora Core 1 for all
Linux systems. Thus, it was convenient to run FC1 on the router
systems as well. The two goals:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create something similar to stock Fedora Core 1 that would fit on a
small drive.
</p></li><li><p>
Change the system configuration to avoid unnecessary writes to the
drive. This is important because Flash drives have a finite lifetime,
so placing log files on them is a bad idea.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
It turns out to be relatively easy to build a custom Fedora
system, especially compared to what was available in previous Red Hat
releases. The key is to build your own system image on another
machine with a fresh RPM database and then transfer that image to the
router. Listing 1, available from the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
FTP site [<a href="../listings/126/7661.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue126/7661.tgz</a>],
shows how to build a basic system image. The procedure is to create a new
RPM database somewhere on your build system, install a minimal set of
RPMs to create the system and then install all other RPMs you want. I
use the --aid option to rpm to tell it to satisfy all dependencies
automatically by looking in a directory where I have placed copies of
all the Fedora RPMs. This saves me the work of manually determining
all the dependencies. Once you have the system image built, copy it
over to the router for testing.
We were able to create a workable system that used 171 of the 256MB
available on the Flash drive.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0d630"></a>
Tweaking the Router Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The goal of using a Linux router is to minimize disk reads and writes.
This is necessary because the memory in a Flash drive can be
written to only a fixed number of times, typically in the hundreds of
thousands. The way to minimize writes is to treat the router as though it
were a
laptop. First, enable laptop mode in the kernel, as described in the
September 2004 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
This causes the system to delay
writes until a read is requested instead of sending writes to the disk
as soon as they occur.
</p><p>
Second, adjust your filesystem mounting options to delay writes as well.
For ext3, set the commit interval to 60 seconds. Then, mount the
filesystem with the noatime option so that reads on files don't generate a write of
modified access times.
</p><p>
Third, move all log files off the drive and into a
RAM-based filesystem, tmpfs. Listing 2 shows how
to restructure your filesystem to move all log files
out of /var and into a tmpfs called /var/impermanent.
For this to be really useful, you also need a script,
such as the one in Listing 3, that saves all the
log files in a tarball on system shutdown and restores
them on boot [Listings 2 and 3 also are available on the
<i  >LJ</i> FTP site]. This script should be called as early
as possible in /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit on startup and as
late as possible during shutdown in /etc/init.d/halt.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0d898"></a>
Configuring the WAN Links</h2></div></div><p>
WAN links are confusing! For example, the T3 and T1 drivers use
different versions of the kernel HDLC stack. This means we have to
keep two different versions of the sethdlc program used to set the
protocol on the WAN circuit, one built against each hdlc stack.
</p><p>
There are many configuration parameters to set on a T3 or T1
circuit&mdash;external or internal timing? CRC size? HDLC mode? and so
on.
Fortunately, SBE's tech support was helpful and supplied many
configuration and troubleshooting tips.
</p><p>
We decided to bond the four T1s into one bonded circuit, using teql.
This worked, but performance was terrible if one of the T1s was
removed, even after it was reconnected. My coworker, Bill Rugolsky,
tracked the problem down to a lack of link status reporting. The SBE
card could report whether the link was up or down, but this message
was not propagated up the stack. Thus, teql continued to try to
send out packets using down interfaces. Bill resolved this by patching
the SBE driver and installing patches others had created to fix teql
and linkwatch notification. The driver patches were provided to SBE,
and we hope they are included in the next revision of their driver.
</p><p>
Our boss Andy Schorr did the work to set up OSPF to handle routing
over the WAN links. The open-source package Quagga, a successor to
Zebra, provides the necessary framework. If one of the
links goes down (remember, there are two links, the T3 and the virtual
link over the bonded T1s), Quagga detects this and starts routing
packets over the other interface. Traditionally, point-to-point links
are configured to borrow the address of another interface, typically
eth0. However, we decided to use dedicated subnets for each point-to-point
link. Andy had to modify the source code to make Quagga work properly
in this setup.
</p><p>
We also had to figure out some iptables rules to make Quagga work
correctly with the bonded T1s. The teql device is send-only, so
packets never appear on it. This causes Quagga to drop the
packets, because they come in on the wrong interface. The fix is a
couple of iptables rules to make packets arriving on all the T1
interfaces (hdlc0 through hdlc3) appear on teql0:


<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i hdlc\+ -j TTL --ttl-inc 1
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i hdlc\+ -j ROUTE --iif teql0
</pre>
</p><p>
The bottom line is that setting up WAN links is tricky work and
requires much study and tweaking. Don't expect things to work
simply because you connect the cables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe0dc08"></a>
Obstacles along the Way</h2></div></div><p>
We had to resolve a number of problems while configuring these WAN
routers. Some of the earlier ones were with the WAN drivers, as
mentioned above. As I was writing this article, we discovered that
our T1 performance had deteriorated badly, with highly variable ping
times&mdash;up to 1 second instead of the usual 10ms. We traced this to one
of the WAN cards not generating interrupts; it had come
loose in the PCI slot. The widely varying packet delays were
occurring because the other device sharing the same interrupt line
(eth0) was sending interrupts. This, in turn, caused the SBE driver to
wake up and process its interrupts.
This type of non-obvious failure highlights the importance of link-quality monitoring.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe045a0"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
We are satisfied with the basic architecture, but a number
of improvements need to be made. Given the annoyances of managing multiple
T1s in a bonded interface, we now are planning on upgrading the T1s to
a second T3. When we do that, we may drop the circuit splitting
entirely. Circuit splitting adds a whole new level of complexity to
the entire system, and we are unsure if it is worth it.
</p><p>
We have to continue to improve our monitoring of both line status and
line quality. It is difficult to complain to circuit vendors about
performance if you don't have historical data to back up your
assertions.
</p><p>
It would have been convenient to use off-the-shelf servers for the
router boxes. We have been investigating the latest 1U rackmount from
a major manufacturer, but for several reasons it is unsuitable. The
showstopper is that the BIOS does not allow booting from any Flash IDE
device. The vendor knows of this limitation but will not fix the
BIOS. Thus, we see ourselves building our own systems for the
foreseeable future.
</p><p>
We will be building additional internal router boxes for handling LAN
traffic, based on the WAN router model we have developed&mdash;1U systems
with Flash drives running a minimal Fedora kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd14580.0xe047b0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although this project is not complete, I feel we've accomplished enough
to take a moment to evaluate its success. The key question is: would
we do it again? The answer is a qualified yes. Our WAN routers
perform the task of providing redundant connections between our office
and backup sites. The usefulness of splitting the WAN circuits for
redundancy is a wash as it adds so much complexity to the design.
</p><p>
This project has taken significantly longer to complete than we
anticipated, a general symptom of developing
your own solutions. The answers are there, but you
expend more time finding them. Having a sharp,
dedicated team (as I did) is crucial to making it
all work. Just make sure to budget extra time for all
the annoying little problems that are sure to arise.
