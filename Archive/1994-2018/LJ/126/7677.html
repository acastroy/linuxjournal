Hardware vendors, please sell me a
high-quality laptop without a pre-installed OS.
We'll both make money.

I'm a collector, but I have one collection I
alternately love and hate. I have several thousand
&ldquo;Designed for Microsoft Windows&rdquo; stickers. I love
them because each one marks a laptop that's been freed
from the Microsoft matrix. I hate them because they
remind me that any laptop you'd actually want
to own for three to four years is born into slavery
by its maker.
</p><p>
EmperorLinux has been installing, configuring,
testing and supporting Linux on brand-name laptops
and notebooks since 1999. This is not easy work.
Getting Linux running well, with full support for all
the hardware on a freshly minted laptop, presents
many significant technical hurdles. Any Linux
laptop worth its salt requires quite a raft of
distribution-specific and system hardware-specific
configuration file modifications, many of which are
beyond current Linux automated configuration tools.
Of course, no modern laptop will have full hardware
support without a very heavily patched kernel.
Customers&mdash;rightfully so&mdash;want solid support for
IEEE-1394 FireWire, ACPI (with suspend), Wi-Fi (both b and g),
external VGA and everything Windows users get from a laptop.
No stock Linux distribution kernel can do this,
and the Linux vendors all disclaim laptop support.
Hardware vendors IBM and Dell even have dipped their
toes into the Linux laptop pool occasionally and
pulled out for reasons of support (lots) and demand
(small).
</p><p>
Consumers should know that no name-brand vendor will
sell them a laptop without a preloaded operating
system. They can be certain that the OS will be
supplied by a much-maligned monopoly. The problem,
of course, is in the nature of the Faustian bargain into which
all major hardware vendors have entered in
order to get where they are today. Every time the
big vendors send their representatives to us, they
ask what they can do for us. I tell them their
hardware design is excellent and that my customers
appreciate the long-term hardware warranties. I ask
only one thing they don't provide, and I am vexed by
the unchanging answer. Even a big vendor's authorized
reseller or strategic partner cannot get this mythical
&ldquo;bare&rdquo; laptop.
</p><p>
Our customers know, I know and the big vendors probably
know these things hold true: 1) laptops are a small
percentage of the total personal computing market; 2)
Linux, though big on the server, is a small part of
the desktop OS market; 3) &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; doesn't mean one
thing, there are at least six viable, popular Linux
distributions, each having two to three versions in
common usage; and 4) taken together, those imply that
there can't possibly be a decent market.
</p><p>
We know that big business is about profit, and that
is fine. Even though I'm a PhD geek who likes
laptops, at the end of the day, I've got a whole
mess of hungry little Georgia Tech graduates to feed.
We know that neither the stability of Linux nor its
high ideals really factor in your decision. If your
projections don't yield the right ROI numbers,
the product idea behind those projections won't get
off the drawing board.
</p><p>
There is a way out of this, which just happens to be a
win-win situation for everyone. Sell &ldquo;bare&rdquo; laptops.
These must be exactly the same systems you purvey
with Windows, only with bare disks (simply add a &ldquo;b&rdquo;
to the end of your model stock codes). Clearly mark
these units as having full hardware warranties but
absolutely no software support for any OS (the Linux
users aren't going to call you anyway). These systems
need not be massively cheaper than your Windows
offerings either. In fact, we all know the &ldquo;Microsoft
Tax&rdquo; is really only a moral affront and that the
dollar cost is well under $100. Don't try to push
a lower-end system on us; we want the full-feature
selection and per-specification configurability you
otherwise would offer. Plenty of Linux
users are out there who want a $3,000 laptop.
</p><p>
Do all this, and here is what you will get: 1)
a massive flow of Linux user goodwill&mdash;the moral
aspect really is important to us; 2) your foot
quickly in the door of a very rapidly growing
market; 3) the ability to sidestep the whole &ldquo;Which Linux
distribution?&rdquo; question, and its support issues,
by disguising it as &ldquo;End-User Choice&rdquo;; and 4) all your
high-margin laptop hardware profit up front, with zero
software support costs later. In short, you will get
a new business line with a very short time-to-market,
high ROI and low risk.
</p><p>
Let's be frank, Mr Big Vendor, you are in the
hardware business and have no resources nor desire
to get into the OS software support business with
individual customers. That is what my company does.
Please take our money and laugh all the way to the
bank. We'll do all the hard work.
