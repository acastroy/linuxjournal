Doc visits an old-fashioned, top-down, IT organization
where &ldquo;open&rdquo; is a dirty word and the number one
priority is avoiding uncertainty.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2398580.0x24904a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're one of the growing number of Linux advocates working in
corporate IT, chances are you're involved in a struggle. Your side, the
Linux/open-source side, is a grassroots movement,
usually driven from the bottom up, not from the top down. Meanwhile,
IT management remains a top-down culture that prefers
&ldquo;solutions&rdquo;
in the form of mandated strategy, not ad hoc problem solving.
</p><p>
To understand what we're up against, it helps to visit the top-down side
where it lives. That's what I did on June 27&ndash;30, 2004, in Boston, at the
32nd Annual Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Membership of
the Information Systems Audit and Control Association, the ISACA.
</p><p>
For all of its 32 years, ISACA has been obsessed with governance,
control, accountability, strategy, planning, risk reduction, business
continuity and so on. Here's a sample of the educational sessions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;'Who Has Access to What': Controlling User Access and Segregation
of Duties with Identity Management&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Enterprise Risk Management and Basel II: The Mission Critical
Role of IT&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Incident Response Forensics Investigation&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Use of Encryption to Enforce Regulatory Compliance&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Successful Software Asset Management&rdquo;
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Not surprisingly, open source wasn't on the agenda&mdash;until this year,
when I was invited to come and teach a class on &ldquo;The Realities of Open
Source&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Before and after I gave my talk, I sat in on a
variety of other sessions. In every case I carried
the only laptop in the room, other than the ones
used by speakers to give Microsoft PowerPoint
presentations. When I pulled it out to take notes,
or to work on my own talk, others looked at me like
I was carrying a loaded weapon. Was I about to commit
an act of wireless hacking, perhaps?
</p><p>
That would have been cool, of course, but not with this crowd. Open
source, to them, smacks of the unknown. The very notion of
&ldquo;open&rdquo; sounds
like a security breach waiting to happen&mdash;a risk best
&ldquo;managed&rdquo; by
avoiding it in the first place.
</p><p>
So giving the talk was a fun challenge. I had addressed newbies before,
but never newbies who also happened to work in IT Governance. I felt
like I was explaining free enterprise to the Politburo in the old
USSR. The cultural distance verged
on the absolute.
</p><p>
I opened with the two questions I already knew were on everybody's mind:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
How do you design an audit to account for open source?
</p></li><li><p>
For that matter, how do you govern, control and assure it?
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I answered by saying &ldquo;We're not in Kansas anymore&rdquo; and proceeded to
explain how many of the civilized graces we take for granted, from e-mail
and Web servers to Amazon and eBay, owed credit to open-source
developers, values and effects&mdash;all of which were as wild and
uncontrollable as the next storm or earthquake.
</p><p>
That said, I went on to explain that open source was also about
<span   class="emphasis"><em>resourceful individuals and groups doing what needs to be
done</em></span>, that
open source is an example of <span   class="emphasis"><em>what happens when the demand side supplies
itself</em></span> and that it can be understood as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>DIY sector of the
Information Systems construction and maintenance business</em></span>.
</p><p>
I also said none of this was especially visible when you looked down at
it from the parapets of Fort Business, demanding that it comply with
approved procedures before Management dropped the bridge across the moat.
</p><p>
I showed the sizes of various open-source conversations on the Web,
which equaled or even exceeded those concerning Microsoft and other
familiar names. I showed how much Linux and open-source code
probably was already running in attendees' companies, whether they knew it
or not.
</p><p>
And, I talked about common interests&mdash;for example, the use value
(rather than the sale value) of software, and also low cost,
availability, quality, integrity, efficiency, effectiveness, continuity,
robust infrastructure, leveraged physical assets, problem solving and
other virtues copied from the slides of other speakers.
</p><p>
In the Q&amp;A we talked about SCO FUD and other predictable issues. One
attendee demanded an explanation for why &ldquo;they&rdquo; (meaning
open-source
advocates) had &ldquo;such terrible manners&rdquo;. Later on a boat tour of Boston
Harbor, she came up to me, waved a cigarette in my face, and insisted
that open-source people &ldquo;have a good case, but they simply must change
their behavior&rdquo;. But she couldn't give me an example of what she meant.
</p><p>
After my talk, several attendees told me they were, in fact, open-source
users and advocates inside their organizations (one was Monsanto), but
that the prospects for open source in large conservative IT
organizations was poor in the short term, even if they were good in the
long term.
</p><p>
The main issue was auditability. One attendee told me that open-source
stuff is, indeed, auditable (for example, the source code itself can be
audited), but that this fact was still far from obvious.
</p><p>
It was clear, however, that for most attendees, open source simply wasn't
on their radar. &ldquo;We don't have any, and we don't plan to have
any&rdquo;, was
the basic response. Another sign: the room was only half-full. The
session after mine was on &ldquo;Wireless Hacking Exposed&rdquo;. It was
standing-room only.
</p><p>
In my July 9, 2004, SuitWatch newsletter, I wrote about the cultural divide I
witnessed at the conference and its near-absolute contrast from
Supernova, the conference where I spoke a couple of days before ISACA.
The theme for Supernova was decentralization. If anything, ISACA's theme
was the polar opposite.
</p><p>
Immediately an e-mail came from Glen Campbell, an IT consultant and
veteran of both cultures. &ldquo;The largest driving factor in most Fortune
2000 IT shops is risk mitigation&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Likewise, the whole concept
of DIY-IT is a complete anachronism to most IT shops. They did DIY-IT in
the '60s, '70s and '80s, and discovered that, not only is it less
expensive to outsource their internal systems (to SAP, or Siebel, or
EDS or IBM), it also&mdash;tada!  &mdash;reduces their risk in that there's
another large corporation out there they can sue if something goes
wrong.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Customers requiring &ldquo;six nines&rdquo; of reliability have been getting it for
years from those same providers, or from HP, Sun or Novell. &ldquo;That's
why Sun can charge 10&ndash;50&times; for a server that runs Apache (which, by the
way, is one of the very few open-source packages that large companies
have come to trust)&rdquo;, Campbell adds.
</p><p>
The regulatory environment has also elevated corporate IT paranoia.
</p><p>
Last year I attended a Harvard Business conference in New York where a
procession of expensive consultants from Deloitte and other companies
described the complex new reporting and accounting procedures required
by the recently passed Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which enforces, post-Enron, a
much higher degree of corporate&mdash;and personal&mdash;accountability.
Regardless of whatever good it intended to do, it also was clear that
Sarbanes-Oxley promised to (borrowing Scott McNealy's immortal words)
&ldquo;darken the skies with consultants&rdquo; and expand corporate
bureaucracies&mdash;IT Governance, for example. It was clear at ISACA that Sarbanes-Oxley
was a godsend for members. Suddenly they found themselves standing
exactly in the direction top corporate brass was forced by the new law
to turn to for help.
</p><p>
So, the question becomes, where does open source fit in a Sarbanes-Oxley
context? Here's Glen Campbell again:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I have a number of friends here in Silicon Valley who are on the
&ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; side of the world. They simply cannot understand why,
when you encounter an IT problem, a company doesn't grab Perl or
Python and write a script that solves it. The IT guys, on the other
hand, look at this with horror; how in the world could this hold up
to a Sarbanes-Oxley investigation, which requires the CEO to
sign off personally on the sources and validity of the corporate
data? How in the world is the CEO going to understand a Perl script?
The CEO will happily pay $100,000 to avoid going to jail because
of this.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And his isn't the only bad news. Another SuitWatch response included this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...my organization's overlords, some of whom were probably at ISACA
and most assuredly none of whom were at Supernova, have issued a
blanket edict forbidding the use of Wi-Fi anywhere inside the entire
(organization) and forbidding the use of Wi-Fi with any
(organization) equipment anywhere at any time. Needless to say, the
(organization) CIO is firmly anti-open source and appears to be a
vassal of Microsoft.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Yet Linux continues to grow in the enterprise. So does the whole LAMP
suite. I'm writing this column in London, at the Identity Management
Summit, where I just finished talking with Conn Crawford, who runs IT
for the City of Sunderland, on the northeast coast of England, and with
Nick Somper, Business Development Manager of Open Systems Management,
Ltd. Both had Linux stories to tell. Crawford
said his city just bought a Red Hat server to issue certificates for the
city's PKI system. Somper's company does &ldquo;adaptive systems
management&rdquo;
for distributed and mixed environments that include UNIX, Linux and
Windows systems. He sees Linux as a large and growing presence
in IT.
</p><p>
Crawford and Somper both live in the market space where Linux has grown
past the grassroots stage. It's part of the IT ecosystem in that space.
Now the challenge is to make Linux more than safe&mdash;in perception as
well as reality&mdash;for the large IT shops where risk aversion is a way
of life. But before we do that, we need to understand the differences
involved.
</p><p>
Adam Hertz, CTO of Ofoto, has a shop where DIY-IT and open source are
ways of life. The company's whole business runs on systems developed
almost entirely internally, on Linux and other open-source components.
It also grows at an extremely fast rate, adding up to two terabytes of
storage every day. His whole business wouldn't be possible without open
source, Linux and DIY-IT. From that perspective, here's what he sees in
the relatively staid environments where most ISACA members live:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Two themes: BigCoIT is all about standardization and isolationism.
</p><p>
Standardization, so the story goes, reduces risks and costs. It
certainly reduces complexity, but it can take a huge toll on
flexibility and responsiveness.
</p><p>
Standardization often involves using one multipurpose tool or
platform to accomplish a lot of different purposes. This often
involves customization, which is done by in-house experts or
professional services firms&mdash;for example, Siebel, Lotus Notes and so on.
</p><p>
DIY shops tend to be cynical, or even downright frightened, of
systems like that, because they're so inflexible and unhackable.
</p><p>
Another form of standardization is what people are allowed to have
on their desktop PCs. In a lot of big shops, everyone has the same
disk image, with all applications pre-installed. There's a huge
suspicion of anything that comes from the outside world, especially
open source. It's regarded as flaky, virus-laden, unscalable and so on.
This produces isolationism, which means major barriers to just
trying something.
</p><p>
In more open environments, there's a permeable membrane between the
corporate IT environment and the Net. People tend to get new tools
from the Net, usually open source, and just give 'em a spin.
Culturally, this keeps the organization open to innovation and new
approaches. It builds bonds between the employees and the
development community at large.
</p><p>
Standardized, isolationist shops miss out on all of this. They
maintain control, but inevitably they fall behind.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
If we want to sell Linux upward into risk-averse enterprises, it would
help to follow the guidance, as well as the example, of J.P. Rangaswami,
CIO of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, the billion-dollar-plus investment bank.
When I asked J.P. to help make sense of the challenge here, he said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Too many shops are currently executing uncertainty management rather
than risk management. And because they don't understand the risk,
they do the right thing and sit on their hands. Once you understand
a risk you are able to price it and make a rational decision. So in
my opinion, shops differ in their ability to price risk, and the
default position is risk aversion, which may be far more expensive
even in the short run than an active risk appetite. Witness the
colossal sums spent on Y2000 just because people could not
understand or price the risk.
</p><p>
DIY-IT is, when based on open source, defensible as a low-risk
position. More people inspect the code. There are more people using
the code. There is more flexing of the code in differing
circumstances. The issue is not of risk but of comprehension.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Last December Risk Waters named J.P. its CIO of the Year.
