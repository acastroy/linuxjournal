Transform your wild-and-woolly legacy RTOS code into
well-formed Linux device drivers.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5a298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux has taken the embedded marketplace by storm. According to
industry analysts, one-third to one-half of new embedded 32- and
64-bit designs employ Linux. Embedded Linux already dominates
multiple application spaces, including SOHO networking and
imaging/multifunction peripherals, and it now is making vast strides in
storage (NAS/SAN), digital home entertainment (HDTV/PVR/DVR/STB)
and handheld/wireless, especially in digital mobile phones.
</p><p>
New embedded Linux applications do not spring, Minerva-like, from
the heads of developers; a majority of projects must accommodate
thousands, even millions of lines of legacy source code. Although
hundreds of embedded projects have successfully ported existing code
from such platforms as Wind River's VxWorks and pSOS, VRTX, Nucleus and
other RTOSes to Linux, the exercise is still nontrivial.
</p><p>
To date, the majority of literature on migration from legacy RTOS
applications to embedded Linux has focused on RTOS APIs, tasking and
scheduling models and how they map to Linux user-space equivalents.
Equally important in the I/O-intensive sphere of embedded programming
is porting RTOS application hardware interface code to the more
formal Linux device driver model.
</p><p>
This article surveys several common approaches to memory-mapped
I/O frequently found in legacy embedded applications. These range
from ad hoc use of interrupt service routines (ISRs) and user-thread
hardware access to the semi-formal driver models found in some RTOS
repertoires. It also presents heuristics and methodologies for
transforming RTOS code into well-formed Linux device drivers. In
particular, the article focuses on memory mapping in RTOS code
vs. Linux, porting queue-based I/O schemes and redefining RTOS
I/O for native Linux drivers and d&aelig;mons.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5a4a8"></a>
RTOS I/O Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
The word that best describes most I/O in RTOS-based systems is
informal. Most RTOSes were designed for older MMU-less CPUs,
so they ignore memory management even when an MMU is present and
make no distinction between logical and physical addressing. Most
RTOSes also execute entirely in privileged state (system mode),
ostensibly to enhance performance. As such, all RTOS application
and system code has access to the entire machine address space,
memory-mapped devices and I/O instructions. Indeed, it is very
difficult to distinguish RTOS application code from driver code
even when such distinctions exist.
</p><p>
This informal architecture leads to ad hoc implementations of I/O
and, in many cases, the complete absence of a recognizable device
driver model. In light of this egalitarian non-partitioning of work,
it is instructive to review a few key concepts and practices as
they apply to RTOS-based software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5a608"></a>
In-Line Memory-Mapped Access</h2></div></div><p>
When commercial RTOS products became available in the mid-1980s,
most embedded software consisted of big mainline loops with polled
I/O and ISRs for time-critical operations. Developers designed RTOSes
and executives into their projects mostly to enhance concurrency
and aid in synchronization of multitasking, but they eschewed any
other constructs that got in the way. As such, even when an RTOS
offered I/O formalisms, embedded programmers continued to perform
I/O in-line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define	DATA_REGISTER  0xF00000F5

char getchar(void) {
  return (*((char *) DATA_REGISTER));
}


void putchar(char c) {
  *((char *) DATA_REGISTER) = c;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
More disciplined developers usually segregate all such in-line I/O
code from hardware-independent code, but I have encountered plenty
of I/O spaghetti as well.
When faced with pervasive in-line memory-mapped I/O usage, embedded
developers who are new to Linux always face the temptation to
port all such code as-is to user space, converting the
<tt  >#define</tt> of
register addresses to calls to <tt  >mmap()</tt>. This approach works fine for
some types of prototyping, but it cannot support interrupt processing,
has limited real-time responsiveness, is not particularly secure
and is not suitable for commercial deployment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5a870"></a>
RTOS ISRs</h2></div></div><p>
In Linux, interrupt service is exclusively the domain of the kernel.
With an RTOS, ISR code is free-form and often indistinguishable from
application code, other than in the return sequence. Many RTOSes
offer a system call or macro that lets code detect its own context,
such as the Wind River VxWorks intContext(). Common also is the
use of standard libraries by ISRs, with accompanying reentrancy
and portability challenges.
</p><p>
Most RTOSes support the registration of ISR code and handle interrupt
arbitration and ISR dispatch. Some primitive embedded
executives, however, support only direct insertion of ISR start
addresses into hardware vector tables.
Even if you attempt to perform read and write operations in-line
in user space, you have to put your Linux ISR into kernel space.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5a9d0"></a>
RTOS I/O Subsystems</h2></div></div><p>
Most RTOSes ship with a customized standard C run-time library,
such as pREPC for pSOS, and selectively patched C libraries (libc)
from compiler ISVs. They do the same for glibc. Thus, at a minimum,
most RTOSes support a subset of standard C-style I/O, including the
system calls open, close, read, write and ioctl. In most cases, these
calls and their derivatives resolve to a thin wrapper around
I/O primitives. Interestingly, because most RTOSes did not support
filesystems, those platforms that do offer file abstractions for
Flash or rotating media often use completely different code and/or
different APIs, such as pHILE for pSOS.
Wind River VxWorks goes further than most RTOS platforms in offering a
feature-rich I/O subsystem, principally to overcome hurdles in
integration and generalization of networking interfaces/media.
</p><p>
Many RTOSes also support a bottom-half mechanism, that is, some means
of deferring I/O processing to an interruptible and/or preemptible
context. Others do not but may instead support mechanisms such as
interrupt nesting to achieve comparable ends.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5ab30"></a>
Typical RTOS Application I/O Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
A typical I/O scheme (input only) and the data delivery path to the main
application is diagramed in Figure 1. Processing proceeds as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A hardware interrupt triggers execution of an ISR.
</p></li><li><p>
The ISR does basic processing and either completes the input
operation locally or lets the RTOS schedule deferred handling. In
some cases, deferred processing is handled by what Linux would
call a user thread, herein an ordinary RTOS task.
</p></li><li><p>
Whenever and wherever the data ultimately is acquired (ISR or
deferred context), ready data is put into a queue. Yes, RTOS ISRs
can access application queue APIs and other IPCs&mdash;see the API table.
</p></li><li><p>
One or more application tasks then read messages from the queue to
consume the delivered data.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7355f1.large.jpg"><img src="7355f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Comparison between Typical I/O and Data Delivery in a Legacy
RTOS and Linux
</p></div></div><p>
Output often is accomplished with comparable mechanisms&mdash;instead of
using write() or comparable system calls, one or more RTOS application
tasks put ready data into a queue. The queue then is drained by an I/O
routine or ISR that responds to a ready-to-send interrupt, a system
timer or another application task that waits pending on queue contents.
It then performs I/O directly, either polled or by DMA.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5b160"></a>
Mapping RTOS I/O to Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The queue-based producer/consumer I/O model described above is one
of many ad hoc approaches employed in legacy designs. Let us continue
to use this straightforward example to discuss several possible
(re)implementations under embedded Linux.
</p><p>
Developers who are reticent to learn the particulars of Linux driver
design, or who are in a great hurry, likely try to port most of
a queue-based design intact to a user-space paradigm. In this
driver-mapping scheme, memory-mapped physical I/O occurs in user context
by way of a pointer supplied by mmap():


<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

#define REG_SIZE   0x4   /* device register size */
#define REG_OFFSET 0xFA400000
                   /* physical address of device */

void *mem_ptr;
         /* de-reference for memory-mapped access */
int fd;

fd=open("/dev/mem",O_RDWR);
           /* open physical memory (must be root) */

mem_ptr = mmap((void *)0x0,
               REG_AREA_SIZE, PROT_READ+PROT_WRITE,
               MAP_SHARED, fd, REG_OFFSET);
                         /* actual call to mmap() */

</pre>
</p><p>
A process-based user thread performs the same processing as the
RTOS-based ISR or deferred task would. It then uses the SVR4 IPC
msgsnd() call to queue a message for receipt by another local thread or by
another process by invoking msgrcv().
</p><p>
Although this quick-and-dirty approach is good for prototyping, it
presents significant challenges for building deployable code. Foremost
is the need to field interrupts in user space. Projects such as DOSEMU
offer signal-based interrupt I/O with SIG (the silly interrupt
generator), but user-space interrupt processing is quite slow&mdash;millisecond latencies instead of tens of microseconds for a
kernel-based ISR. Furthermore, user-context scheduling, even with the
preemptible Linux kernel and real-time policies in place, cannot
guarantee 100% timely execution of user-space I/O threads.
</p><p>
It is highly preferable to bite the bullet and write at least a simple
Linux driver to handle interrupt processing at kernel level. A basic
character or block driver can field application interrupt data directly
in the top half or defer processing to a tasklet, a kernel thread or to
the newer work-queue bottom-half mechanism available in the 2.6 kernel. One or
more application threads/processes can open the device and then perform
synchronous reads, just as the RTOS application made synchronous queue
receive calls. This approach will require at least recoding
consumer thread I/O to use device reads instead of queue receive operations.
</p><p>
To reduce the impact of porting to embedded Linux, you also could leave
a queue-based scheme in place and add an additional thread or d&aelig;mon
process that waits for I/O on the newly minted device. When data is
ready, that thread/d&aelig;mon wakes up and queues the received data for
use by the consuming application threads or processes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5b4d0"></a>
Porting Approaches</h2></div></div><p>
Porting RTOS code to embedded Linux does not differ conceptually from
enterprise application migration. After the logistics of porting have
been addressed (make/build scripts and methods, compiler compatibility,
location of include files and so on), code-level porting challenges turn on
the issues of application architecture and API usage.
</p><p>
For the purposes of the discussion at hand, let us assume that the
application part (everything except I/O-specific code) migrates
from the RTOS-based system into a single Linux process. RTOS tasks
map to Linux threads and intertask IPCs map to Linux
inter-process and inter-thread equivalents.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7355f2.large.jpg"><img src="7355f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Mapping RTOS Tasks to Linux Process-Based Threads
</p></div></div><p>
Although the basic shape of the port is easy to understand, the devil is in
the details. And the most salient details are the RTOS APIs in use and
how to accommodate them with Linux constructs.
</p><p>
If your project is not time-constrained, and if your goal is to
produce portable code for future project iterations, then you want
to spend some time analyzing the current structure of your RTOS
application and how/if it fits into the Linux paradigm. For RTOS
application code, you want to consider the viability of one-to-one
mapping of RTOS tasks onto Linux process-based threads and whether to
repartition the RTOS application into multiple Linux processes.
Depending on that decision, you should review the RTOS IPCs in use
to determine proper intra-process vs. inter-process scope.
</p><p>
On the driver level, you definitely want to convert any informal
in-line RTOS code to proper drivers. If your legacy application
already is well partitioned, either using RTOS I/O APIs or at least
segregated into a distinct layer, your task becomes much easier. If ad
hoc I/O code is sprinkled liberally throughout your legacy code base,
you've got your work cut out for you.
</p><p>
Developers in a hurry to move off a legacy RTOS or those trying
to glue together a prototype are more likely to attempt to map or
convert as many RTOS APIs to Linux equivalents in situ. Entities
in common, such as comparable APIs, IPCs and system data types,
port nearly transparently. Others can be addressed with #define
redefinition and macros. Those remaining need to be recoded,
ideally as part of an abstraction layer.
</p><p>
You can get a head start on API-based porting by using emulation
libraries that accompany many embedded Linux distributions (including MontaVista's
libraries for Wind River VxWorks and pSOS) or by using
third-party API-mapping packages from companies such as MapuSoft.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7355f3.large.jpg"><img src="7355f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Multipronged Approach to Porting RTOS Code and APIs to Linux
</p></div></div><p>
Most projects take a hybrid approach, mapping all comparable or easily
translatable APIs, re-architecting where it doesn't slow things down
and playing Whack-a-Mole with the remaining code until it builds and runs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a5bbb0"></a>
Available APIs in Kernel and User Space</h2></div></div><p>
For both intensive re-architecting and for quicker-and-dirtier API
approaches, you still have to (re)partition your RTOS application
and I/O code to fit the Linux kernel and user-space paradigm.
Table 1 illustrates how Linux is much stricter about
privileged operations than a legacy RTOS and helps guide you in the
(re)partitioning process.

Two important distinctions are called out in Table 1:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
RTOSes are egalitarian, letting application and I/O code
touch any address and perform almost any activity, whereas Linux
is much more hierarchical and restrictive.
</p></li><li><p>
Legacy RTOS code can see every symbol or entry point in the
system, at least at link time, whereas Linux user code is
isolated from and built separately from kernel code and its
accompanying namespace.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The consequences of the Linux hierarchy of privileged access is
normally only kernel code (drivers) actually accesses physical memory.
User code that also does so must run as root.
</p><p>
In general, user-space code is isolated from the Linux kernel and can
see only explicitly exported symbols as they appear in /proc/ksyms.
Moreover, visible system calls to the kernel are not invoked directly
but by calls to user library code. This segregation is intentional,
enhancing stability and security in Linux.
</p><p>
When you write a driver, the opposite is true. Statically linked drivers
are privy to the entire kernel namespace, not only exports, but have
zero visibility into user-space process-based symbols and entry points.
And, when you encapsulate driver code in run-time loadable modules, your
program can leverage only those interfaces explicitly exported in the kernel
by the *EXPORT_SYMBOL* macro.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a536d0"></a>
Migrating Network Drivers</h2></div></div><p>
As indicated above, porting character and block device drivers to Linux
is a straightforward if time-consuming activity. Porting network drivers,
though, can seem much more daunting.
</p><p>
Remember that while Linux grew up with TCP/IP, most RTOSes had
networking grafted onto them in the late 1990s. As such, legacy
networking often only presents bare-bones capabilities, such as being able
to handle only a single session or instance on a single port or to
support only a physical interface on a single network medium. In some
cases,
networking architecture was generalized after the fact, as with Wind
River VxWorks MUX code to allow for multiple interfaces and types of
physical connection.
</p><p>
The bad news is that you likely have to rewrite most or all of your
existing network interfaces. The good news is that re-partitioning for
Linux is not hard and you have dozens of open-source
network device driver examples to choose from.
</p><p>
Your porting task is to populate the areas at the bottom of
Figure 4 with suitable packet formatting and interface code.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7355f4.large.jpg"><img src="7355f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Block Diagram of Linux Network Drivers
</p></div></div><p>
Writing network drivers is not for beginners. Because, however, many RTOS
network drivers actually were derived from existing GPL Linux
interfaces, you might find the process facilitated by the code itself.
Moreover, there is a large and still-growing community of integrators
and consultants focused on making a business of helping embedded
developers move their applications to Linux, for reasonable fees.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2962580.0x2a53af0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The goal of this article has been to give embedded developers some
insight into both the challenges they will face and benefits they will
realize from moving their entire software stack from a legacy RTOS to
Linux. The span of 2,800 words or so is too brief to delve into many of
the details of driver porting (driver APIs for bus interfaces, address
translation and so on), but the wealth of existing open-source GPL driver
code serves as both documentation and a template for your migration
efforts. The guidelines presented here should help your team
scope the effort involved in a port of RTOS to Linux and provide
heuristics for re-partitioning code for the best native fit to embedded
Linux.
