The flagship application was headed for the rocks.
One man seized the wheel and guided the ship to
safety&mdash;but will he be keelhauled for acting without
orders?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff8348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At each of the companies where I have worked in the
past eight years, I have introduced Linux in some
capacity. It often seemed the obvious choice, but
what was obvious to me and other colleagues was not
obvious to everyone.
Some people needed persuading before they would accept what to them was
an unconventional solution. In most cases, benchmarks and cost factors
were enough to tip the balance. Novelty and openness to new ideas
were sufficient for others. But, for a stubborn minority, nothing could
persuade them. Although they participated in the debate, it appeared that
for them discussion was simply a tactic to avoid implementation.
</p><p>
Faced with such opposition, arguments are pointless and demonstrations
are a waste of time. In those situations, other tactics are called for.
Here I describe how I persuaded my employer to port the company's flagship
application to Linux literally before the opposition in management knew
what was happening.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff84a8"></a>
Background</h2></div></div><p>
In 1998, I was UNIX and Oracle administrator for a company called
Constellar Ltd. They specialised in data migration and Enterprise
Application Integration (EAI) solutions for Global 2000 companies.
What does that mean? At its simplest, it might mean transforming the
data in a legacy mainframe database for insertion into a newly
prepared database. Such tasks are by their nature repetitive and
time consuming. They are ideal candidates for automation and that is
where the Constellar Hub comes in.
</p><p>
Add a few extra offices in different parts of the world, more databases
for customer data, warehouse inventories and order tracking and imagine
how these assorted data stores and applications could be made to work
together seamlessly. Throw in a live environment and a company that
relies on accurate available data, and you begin to understand how
complex the task could become.
</p><p>
The main application was a client server called the Constellar Hub,
which was designed to extract data from disparate sources, processing,
weeding and integrating it on the fly before writing or streaming the
transformed data to its destination.
</p><p>
The server relied on an Oracle database to store data in transit, as well
as the metadata in which the business rules were held, data types were
defined and the relationship between the multifarious data sources and
destinations were stored.
</p><p>
The combined transient data and metadata were held in upward of
200 database tables with many triggers and constraints to
enforce the integrity of the data as it flowed through the bowels of
the application. The engine of the application consisted primarily of C
and SQL code, but an API provided the opportunity to extend functionality
if required.
</p><p>
On a large project, two or many Hub servers might be required, sometimes
located at remote sites around the world, feeding or being fed data
through
frame relay or less likely the Internet. Typically,
an average project would process many gigabytes of data and usually hundreds,
thousands or, more rarely, tens of thousands of business rules would be defined.
</p><p>
In many cases, the whole project of which the Hub was only a part&mdash;albeit
a central part&mdash;would cost in the millions and involve dozens of technical
and business staff.
</p><p>
Prospective customers would be given a relatively simple demonstration
of the tool running on test data, typically on Sun hardware. The
server had been ported to various other shades of UNIX, including Dynix, Data
General UNIX, AIX and Digital UNIX.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff8818"></a>
Windows NT Makes Its Entrance</h2></div></div><p>
It was also around that time that Windows NT was
being promoted as an enterprise-ready OS destined to
take over in many areas previously thought to be the
exclusive domain of UNIX. Indeed, our vice president
of engineering was convinced that the future was
Microsoft and told us so. In the future, he said,
most if not all our sales would be generated from
the Windows NT version of the Hub. As a first move,
they already were working on a Windows NT port and
had announced the beta version in February 1998. Such
a view was understandable, because the cost of a Windows
NT box versus the various UNIX platforms tended
to highlight only the expense of UNIX solutions.
Linux was destined to change all that.
</p><p>
By that time, I already was using Linux on all my home PCs as well as my
workplace workstation. I also followed Linux developments fairly closely,
especially any that might affect the adoption of Linux in the enterprise
workplace. Like many other Linux advocates, I saw the possibility of
a computing future that might not be restricted to the products of a
single company imposed on a captive customer base and wondered if the
Constellar Hub could be ported to Linux.
</p><p>
There were two problems, however. First, the Hub made extensive use of Oracle
databases and Oracle-specific features, and it would be a nightmare
porting those dependencies to a Linux-friendly equivalent.
Second, and this was a more difficult hurdle to clear, a few
people in the company were not predisposed to see the opportunities
presented by a Linux port.
</p><p>
I vaguely had suggested to one or two members of middle management
that perhaps there ought to be a Linux port, but the response I received
in return was along the lines that Linux is an amazing product for a
bunch of amateurs to have produced, but it wasn't quite ready for
the big leagues, and the company couldn't afford the time and expense of
porting to it when there was serious business to deal with. I have heard
that argument many times since then and have learned it is largely an
excuse for not thinking.
</p><p>
Two things changed the nature of the ball game. First, in September 1998,
Larry Ellison announced, with excellent timing, that Oracle would release
a Linux version of its database server and made it free for download
for development use. This had a dual effect. It demonstrated that some
very large companies were taking Linux seriously, and at
the same time, it made the possibility of a Linux port of the Constellar
Hub feasible.
</p><p>
I decided that if I couldn't persuade them to port the
Hub I would do it myself, so I copied the Hub source
code and set about providing a proof of concept. I
figured this either would get me the sack or provide
a fait accompli with which those in opposition could
not argue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff8ad8"></a>
I &ldquo;Steal&rdquo; the Code</h2></div></div><p>
At this point I should say &ldquo;Don't do what I did.&rdquo; It is illegal to
copy your employer's source code without permission, and you are likely to find yourself at
the wrong end of a lawsuit if it all goes belly up, but sometimes dire
circumstances require drastic solutions.
</p><p>
In late November 1998, I checked out a full set of source code and, along
with a newly downloaded copy of Oracle 8.0.4, I set up the development
environment on my PC at home; using the unedited Makefile from the
Solaris development directory, I ran <tt  >make</tt>. Not
surprisingly, it all fell
in a heap, throwing up pages of compile errors.
</p><p>
I devoted an hour or two most evenings to stepping through the errors
and debugging them. Those I didn't understand I presented to Richard
Glover, one of the senior UNIX developers at Constellar. He also was
the release manager for the various UNIX versions of the Hub, so he was
a good person to know.
</p><p>
Most of the problems revolved around the Oracle ProC precompiler, which
didn't recognise some Linux-specific directives, such as the
include_next statements in the Linux header files. This was resolved
by copying the relevant files, stripping the
<tt  >#include_next</tt> statements
out and placing the location of our customised version of these files
first in the include path.
</p><p>
There also were assorted issues with library paths. These were trivial
and related solely to the setup on my home PC. They were solved by
adding entries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH shell variable exactly as it would
be with Solaris. Some macro definitions&mdash;ULONG_MAX, INT_MIN, INT_MAX,
LONG_MAX&mdash;were missing from the copy of Red Hat that I was using at the
time. I copied them from the relevant Solaris headers as a temporary fix.
</p><p>
I left some minor problems unresolved because my resources were somewhat
limited. For instance, the Hub was required to connect to many and varied
sources of data, and some of these required the use of IBM MQ series
libraries, which I did not have available at the time. In any case, I did
not have the facilities to test such functionality at home. I edited the
main Makefile to disable the linking of these libraries and accepted
that my version of the Hub would be a lightweight, more dynamic kind of
Hub. If it compiled at all, I would be happy.
</p><p>
Some differences found in the Linux version of various utilities were
sorted out by editing scripts to reflect the proper invocation
of particular utilities. I worked my way around some of them, and I ignored
others to save time. Richard would later track down the source of all these
problems and make allowances for them in the platform-specific sections
of various build scripts in the official build environment at work. Those
utilities that required changes to the standard build scripts included
various compiler and linker flags. We were obliged to use the Sun compiler
for the official Solaris build, so moving to Linux and GCC required a
bit of translation with regard to the flags and switches. The use of df,
the shell built-in echo command, ftp, ldd, mknod, nm, ps and lex/yacc
(used for the proprietary Transformation Definition Language) all
required changes when invoked.
</p><p>
As Richard pointed out a few weeks later, the set -o posix option
in bash resolved nearly all the shell script differences, and in any
case, the command-line differences were quite trivial and the solution
obvious. In some cases, it was simply a case of providing Berkeley versions
of the utilities rather than the System V ones, or vice versa.
The situation would be different today, because many of the GNU utilities
standard on Linux
are now included as standard
with Solaris, so porting between the two has become even simpler.
</p><p>
In all, it probably took about two man-days to get a rough-and-ready port
with a binary that at least looked like an executable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff9000"></a>
The Smoke Test</h2></div></div><p>
I had a binary, now I needed to test it. I checked out a copy of the suite of test
scripts and data used in the daily smoke test at work. After setting the
environment variables for the smoke test, I set the test harness running.
</p><p>
The usual smoke test consisted of more than 200 transactions, and on
the other platforms would take anything from six hours for UNIX versions to more than 24
hours for the Windows NT version&mdash;this is not good when testing a daily
build. I ran the test on my home-built Linux port, and within a minute
or two I had errors scrolling up the screen. Disaster. I checked the error
logs, but they were no help. For some reason, the logs didn't provide any
diagnostics for the first few dozen transactions, and this confused me.
</p><p>
It took a while to figure out that the reason there were no diagnostics
in the error log for the initial set of transactions was simply because
the Linux Hub already had run the first few dozen transactions successfully!
This initially was hard to believe, because the same set of transactions
took considerably longer to run on most of the other platforms to
which the Hub was ported. This meant that my rough homebrew Linux
version of the Hub was, without tuning, already faster on my home PC
than some of the other UNIX ports, and several times faster than the
Windows NT port. Even allowing for the differences between the hardware
specifications on which these varied ports ran, it looked good.
</p><p>
I felt sure that if these results could be reproduced in the workplace,
there would have to be an official Linux port.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff9210"></a>
Politics</h2></div></div><p>
My suggestion that the Hub be ported to Linux previously had been met with
a lukewarm response from the middle management with whom I had broached
the subject, so I decided to adopt a different tactic this time around.
</p><p>
Several others had expressed an interest in finding out more about Linux,
so a couple of months previously we had formed a company Linux User Group
with a mail list on the company mail server and a meeting to talk tech
once a week. I let the other members&mdash;Ngozi Mayo, Anthony Durity
and Olusola Ojeje&mdash;know what I had been up to and they provided useful
feedback and advice.
</p><p>
After some thought, I realised that I had no idea who, if anyone, in senior
management would lend support to the idea of a Linux port. I decided to
e-mail all of them and the members of the board and hope that someone among
them would take an interest.
</p><p>
I planned to announce the alpha port in the style of a press release and
see if it would get me the sack or not. I wrote a draft release with
a number of bullet points and submitted it for review to the members of
the LUG. I made corrections, simplified the announcement and toned down
the style as suggested, and then I sent off the revised release and waited for
a response.
</p><p>
On February 26, 1999, I pointed out in my press release that the
port had cost the company nothing, that the Linux port ran the smoke
test several times faster than the Windows NT version, and at least as
fast as the other UNIX ports, that there was an increasing trend toward
Linux ports of enterprise software and that now, 1999, was the time to
get on board. I requested that the company supply hardware to enable an
official company Linux port and that it be defined as a tier-three platform
to give it official status. Quotes from IDC, highlighting a 212% increase
in Linux sales that year and 17% share of the enterprise market, helped
shock the complacent into life.
For many of the e-mail recipients these facts and figures were a
revelation.
</p><p>
The e-mail generated an immediate response and much discussion. Some
people sent congratulations and others speculated about possible
marketing angles. One senior Sales Consulting Manager questioned
the need for a Linux port at all, pointing out that in the previous two
years not one customer had requested such a thing. We would all still be
riding round in horse and carriage if that attitude prevailed. Someone
suggested that &ldquo;Enterprise deals are closed on enterprise
platforms&rdquo;
without then explaining why Windows NT was an &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo; platform or
how Linux was not. Others didn't quite understand what Linux was and
the LUG did their best to explain.
</p><p>
The final word went to our CEO Nic Birtles who proved to be both
insightful and encouraging. In his pithy e-mail response to the ongoing
debate, he simply asked what had to be done to be able to announce a
Linux version of the HUB. Debate over.
</p><p>
We got our hardware for a dedicated Linux development machine and
the Linux port became an official tier-three platform. Having produced a
rough-and-ready port merely to prove a point, the task of producing a robust
Linux binary
was given to Richard Glover.
</p><p>
Everything went quiet for a while, and then one day in early May 1999, Richard
quietly mentioned in passing that the Linux port had a 100% pass rate
the previous night and that it had taken only five hours to complete. Good
news. How long did the Windows NT version take? Fifteen hours on a good
night, although some nights the process had to be killed because there
weren't enough hours in a day.
</p><p>
Another in-house press release for management and senior staff
was prepared and sent to announce the beta release and the amazing
test results. It garnered a wide range of comments both positive and
negative. In the latter category, our Director of European Marketing
flirted with both sides in her e-mail: &ldquo;Great
job&rdquo; but then
spoiled it by suggesting that we didn't want to be a trailblazer
in the Linux &ldquo;space&rdquo;, no matter that the Linux port ran faster than
any of the other ports and three times faster than the Windows NT
version. Fortunately, most reactions were much more positive and the most
important one, the CEO's, was both congratulatory and helpful. He suggested
that the Linux port could now become a tier-two platform alongside
Windows NT and the other UNIXes. Only Solaris and AIX were tier-one.
</p><p>
By July 1999, the Linux port was added to the official application CD.
</p><p>
By the time we had an official Linux release of the Constellar Hub on
the CD, 25% of the UK workforce had joined the Linux User Group, and the
Linux objectors were a small and subdued minority keeping their thoughts
to themselves.
</p><p>
The Constellar Hub subsequently was bought by Data Mirror who continues
to offer and support the Linux version, which currently is at version
3.8. Thanks to a bit of guerilla porting and a CEO who knew a bargain when
he saw one, this Linux application finally found its way out into the open.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f00580.0x1ff98f0"></a>
Postscript: Cats and Dogs</h2></div></div><p>
So why is it so difficult to convince some people in the face of
such revealing benchmarks? The cost of the port was close to zero, the
performance was superior to almost all the other ports and the resulting
Linux Hub was rock solid.
</p><p>
It think the answer to that question hinges around the personality of
the individuals concerned. There seems to be two types
of people involved in this debate, and although each may be amenable to
argument, their instinct leaves them predisposed to favour particular
forms of software solutions.
</p><p>
One group prefers a clear and rigid hierarchy. They want to know who
they are answerable to and who is answerable to them.
They want one organisation providing one
solution and would like to dispense with the alternatives. They respect
the dominant player, whoever it is. They feel at ease with conformity
and would prefer it if you would conform too.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the second group values freedom of choice. They tend
not to take anything for granted, want to see under the bonnet when
considering a product and always are ready to look at alternatives. They
certainly don't want to be told what to do but are amenable to argument
and debate.
</p><p>
These two groups might be characterised as dogs and cats. The dogs
listen to their masters' voice and defend their own territory and that of
their master. They
know their place and yours and would prefer to keep it that way.
</p><p>
The second group are cats. They don't recognise a master, never mind his
voice. There are no limits to their territory, and they range widely. They
are curious and seek out new pastures and are at ease with the unfamiliar.
</p><p>
Next time you are having problems introducing Linux into the workplace,
the resistance you encounter might have nothing to do with
the strengths and weaknesses of the software under discussion. It simply might
be that you are a cool cat trying to persuade an old dog to learn
new tricks.
