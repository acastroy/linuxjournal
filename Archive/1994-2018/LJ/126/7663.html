The Game of Security</i></h3></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Marcel Gagn&eacute;</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #126, October 2004</div></div><div><p>
After dealing with the worm and virus
traffic that a legacy OS dumps onto your network, you
might feel like playing a game to relax.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e79580.0x1f71348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Excellent, Fran&ccedil;ois, I think you have those viruses on the run. Don't
get cocky, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. The horde already is dragging away everything
in your recipes directory. Shoot, Fran&ccedil;ois! Shoot! I know, they just keep
on coming, but who said good system security meant you could sit
back and watch? This is a war, and those little green guys aren't going to
give you a moment's peace. Pay attention now. To the right now&mdash;ah,
too late. A valiant effort, but now it is my turn.
</p><p>
What am I thinking? Our guests will be here any moment. Prepare the
tables and make sure all the computers are up and ready to go. To work,
Fran&ccedil;ois! Here they come. Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where
good food, good wine and Linux naturally go hand in hand. Please
sit and make yourselves comfortable. We have some exciting software for
you to sample today, and speaking of sampling...Fran&ccedil;ois, head down
to the wine cellar. In the south wing, you'll find a case of 1992 Toscana
Vin Santo from Italy. Bring it up for our guests
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>!
</p><p>
As you may be aware, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, this month's issue is dedicated
to security. We all know that Linux, by design and by its nature, is
a far more secure operating system than a common legacy desktop
OS. You know the one I am talking about.
Odds are pretty good you've
either seen it or (<span   class="emphasis"><em>gasp!</em></span>) even used it.
Given that other operating system's problems with security (not
to mention the extend, embrace and just plain take over philosophy
behind it), it's not surprising that this theme tends to show up in a
number of games. That's the feature of our menu today&mdash;call it
the lighter side of system security.
</p><p>
The first game on today's menu is one we've served up before
at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, but I just have to mention it again. I'm talking
about Brian Wellington and Matias Duarte's <span   class="emphasis"><em>XBill</em></span>
(see the on-line Resources section). Somehow, it seems like the perfect introduction to
this menu. <span   class="emphasis"><em>XBill</em></span> probably is already installed on your computer. The
command is simply <tt  >xbill</tt>. If it is not installed, check your
distribution CDs before you download a copy.
</p><p>
The idea is simple. It is your job to save the world's computer networks
from an evil virus writer known as Bill, as he tries to load a virus
(cleverly disguised as an operating system) onto otherwise healthy
computers. Evil clones wander about the play area
(Figure 1), stealing operating systems. To stop this from happening,
click on the micro-clones using your mouse. Work fast!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7663f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. <span  class="emphasis"><em>XBill</em></span>: Can you stop
Bill?
</p></div></div><p>
Once upon a time, there was a rather popular arcade game called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Defender</em></span>, which over time, spawned a huge number of imitators (or
homages). One of these creations, Bill Kendrick's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Defendguin</em></span>, pits our hero Tux against evil aliens bent on enslaving,
assimilating and mutating a planet of peaceful penguins into deadly
penguinoids. These aliens, who look an awful lot like the guy named
Bill from <span   class="emphasis"><em>XBill</em></span>, turn the helpless denizens into flying, killing machines. Once
a penguin gets transformed into a penguinoid, there is no hope for
the poor beast&mdash;just blast it. Better yet, blast the alien intruders
and get those points up (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7663f2.large.jpg"><img src="7663f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Marcel loses yet
another ship playing <span  class="emphasis"><em>Defendguin</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Defendguin</em></span> site provides precompiled binaries for a number of
platforms as well as the source code. To build
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Defendguin</em></span>, you need
the SDL development libraries. Should you choose to go the source route,
it is a simple matter of extracting the bundle, typing
<tt  >make</tt>
and then <tt  >sudo make install</tt>.
</p><p>
To play the game, run the command <tt  >defendguin</tt> and prepare
yourself for a high-energy, fast-paced shoot-em-up. For full-screen
action, add the -f option to the command.
</p><p>
Most modern offices running that other OS fight a never-ending battle
against viruses. Trying to keep all those files and directories safe from
dangerous intruders doesn't really sound like a game to those who fight
the fight every day. But if you stop to think about it for a moment, you
have to admit, it's the perfect inspiration for a game and that game is
Stephen Sweeney's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Virus Killer</em></span>. Here's the premise: viruses
attack your system through security holes in applications native
to that other OS. Now, your files are in danger and the only thing that
stands in the way is you.
</p><p>
Get your copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Virus Killer</em></span> at
the Web site (see Resources). Binary and source RPMs as well as source are
available from the site. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Virus Killer</em></span> is another SDL game. To compile
it, you need the development libraries for SDL_image, SDL_mixer
and SDL_ttf. Make sure you have zziplib and its development library as
well. Once the appropriate development libraries are in place, it is
a pretty simple install:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf viruskiller-0.9-1.tar.gz
cd viruskiller-0.9-1
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
To play, simply type <tt  >viruskiller</tt>. The program
builds its list of files and directories based on your home directory. These
then are the targets that the viruses in the game try to infect
or otherwise destroy. Your job is to blast the little monsters before
they can do any damage. As the Web site's FAQ points out, the viruses
in the game do not actually destroy anything&mdash;it is only a game. If,
however, you feel nervous seeing a little green monster drag away that
document you've spent hours working on, try this version of the command:
<tt  >viruskiller +safemode</tt>.
</p><p>
This generates a file and directory list based on your system's
/tmp directory and should help you feel better about those
pesky viruses dragging away important documents.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7663f3.large.jpg"><img src="7663f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

before they destroy your files in <span  class="emphasis"><em>Virus Killer</em></span>.
</p></div></div><p>
The final item on today's menu is a little something called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freedroid RPG</em></span>. Johannes Prix and Reinhard Prix's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freedroid RPG</em></span>
is a beautiful 3-D role-playing game with superb graphics, a cool
soundtrack and sound effects, and a well-developed world. Here's the
backstory: sometime, in the not too distant future, a mega-corporation known
as Megasoft effectively has taken over the galaxy. They
managed to do this by using their vast corporate power to install trojan
horses in every computer-equipped machine on the planet, including those
of the government and police. As a result, all of humanity was enslaved. Due
to some terrible programming error, however, the machines rebelled and
took over, making things worse than they already were.
</p><p>
The only hope for mankind now is a cyborg version of Tux, a so-called
lunarian. Equipped with high-tech armor, low-tech magic and a
laser sword, our hero is ready to take on the machines and bring freedom
to the galaxy. Along the way, you battle all sorts of villains and
monsters, pick up items, money and weapons and meet up with all sorts
of interesting characters. I even ran into a chef named Michelangelo
whose favorite oven is down. He apparently needs dilithium crystals.
</p><p>
Can Tux help him repair it? The only way to find out is to play, and the
only way to play is to get a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freedroid RPG</em></span> (see
Resources). The download itself is a
rather large file, around 60MB for the compressed
tarball. This is, after all, an intensely graphical game.
Source packages are available on the site, but binary
packages are floating around for various distributions. For instance, I had
no trouble finding an RPM package for Mandrake. Should you
go the source route, building is an easy but slightly modified extract
and build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf freedroidrpg-0.9.12.tar.bz2
cd freedroidrpg-0.9.12
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
As with the previous games, you need the SDL development
libraries. If you are going to build the package with OpenGL support,
you need those libraries as well. When the build and install is
complete, you are ready to go. There are two ways to start up FreedroidRPG
and these depend on whether you are running an accelerated OpenGL system
or are stuck with plain old 2-D acceleration. The OpenGL method involves typing
<tt  >freedroidRPG</tt> (case matters here). To start in non-OpenGL mode,
type this instead: <tt  >freedroidRPG -n</tt>.
</p><p>
When the game first loads, you are asked to choose a single or
multiplayer game and then to load a particular hero or start with a
new one. If this is your first game, you obviously want to start with
a new hero. Type in the name you want&mdash;Fran&ccedil;ois, for example. When
you press Enter, the game loads and the adventure begins. If this is
your first game, read the introductory information
scrolling across the screen to learn the story behind the games,
what the various keystrokes do and a lot of other useful information. When
you have all this down pat (it takes only a few seconds), click anywhere
on the screen to begin.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7663f4.large.jpg"><img src="7663f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

head out on the <span  class="emphasis"><em>Freedroid RPG</em></span> adventure.
</p></div></div><p>
You can move around using your mouse in this 3-D world. Click ahead of
your hero and he follows you. Click on objects to pick them
up and right-click to activate your current skill or tool (your laser
sword, for example). On the lower right-hand side of the screen
are three circles. One brings up your hero's current statistics,
another activates his inventory browser and another lets you select
skills or tools (displayed in the lower left). At any time during the
course of the game, pressing the Esc key brings up a menu from which
you can modify various game-play options (graphics, sound, performance
and so on). By default, game play is full screen but this is one of the settings
you can change under the graphics options menu.
</p><p>
As you play, heed this friendly warning, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Freedroid</em></span> (like
all of the other games covered here today) is very addictive. You may
find that time miraculously vanishes as you play. That's why I'm going
to tell you about the save feature. If midway through a game, you need to
pause to eat or sleep, press Esc to bring up the in-game menu, then select
Save Game. You now can quit your in-process game safely and return
to it later by choosing Load Existing Hero at the start of the game.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, but it happens quickly. It seems we
barely have started, and it already is closing time. I see that many of you are a little
too wired from fighting the forces of poor security to head home right
away. That's fine. My faithful waiter, Fran&ccedil;ois, will pour you a final
glass of wine. Perhaps in the time that you have left, you might take
another opportunity to make the world safe from viruses, worms, evil
corporations and other unsavory security risks. Until next time,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, let us all drink to one another's health.
