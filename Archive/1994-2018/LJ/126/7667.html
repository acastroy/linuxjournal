Errors in setting permissions are the often-frustrating cause of many
common Linux problems, so learn the fundamentals of permissions and take the
first step to understanding Linux security.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d3348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For most of the Paranoid Penguin's illustrious four years with
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, I've tended to
write tools-focused columns. I've described how to secure Sendmail,
how to add SSL encryption to things by using Stunnel and how to get any
number of other powerful security software tools configured and running.
</p><p>
Over the next couple of columns, however, I am going to address one of
the most basic and important, yet often-overlooked aspects of Linux
security; filesystem permissions. If used wisely, it will be
harder for users and intruders to abuse their system privileges.
If you set them carelessly, however, minor vulnerabilities can lead to major
system compromises.
</p><p>
These articles should be especially useful to Linux newcomers who wonder
what all the <tt  >drwxr-xr-x</tt> gobbledygook in file
listings means. But,
even if you're an intermediate user&mdash;perhaps the kind who doesn't yet
understand the precise ramifications of setuid and setgid&mdash;these
articles, especially Part II, may have something for you too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d35b0"></a>
Prelude: Everything Is a File</h2></div></div><p>
Did you know that in UNIX and UNIX-like systems, basically everything is represented by
files? Documents, pictures and even executable programs are easy
to conceptualize as files on your hard disk. Although we think
of a directory as a container of files, a directory actually
is a file containing, you guessed it, a list of other files.
</p><p>
Similarly, the CD-ROM drive attached to your system seems tangible enough,
but to your Linux kernel, it too is a file&mdash;the special device file
/dev/cdrom. To send data from it or to write it to the CD-ROM drive, the
kernel actually reads to and writes from this special file. Actually,
on most systems, /dev/cdrom is a symbolic link to /dev/hdb or some
other special file. And wouldn't you know it, a symbolic link is in turn
nothing more than a file containing the location of another file.
</p><p>
Other special files, such as named pipes, act as input/output (I/O)
conduits, allowing one process or program to pass data to another.
</p><p>
My point here is not to describe each and every type of file that
exists in Linux or UNIX. It's to illustrate how nearly
everything is represented by a file. Once you understand this, it's
much easier to understand why filesystem security is such a big deal
and how it works.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d37c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Commands and Man Pages</b></p><p>
In this article, I focus on filesystem concepts rather than the
precise syntax and usage of actual commands. But if you're a beginner,
you may be wondering how to execute commands at all and
where can you find syntax/usage help.
</p><p>
First, in all of my examples and example scenarios, I'm working in
a terminal window. Microsoft Windows users can think of a terminal
as like a
DOS prompt or command window. A terminal window
provides the most direct means of interacting with Linux, that is,
by letting you enter all your commands manually rather than by triggering
them with mouse clicks.
</p><p>
To start your own shell session from GNOME, click the Main Menu
button and select System Tools&rarr;Terminal. In KDE, the terminal
command is called konsole, and it has its own icon on the taskbar,
a clamshell in front of a computer screen. Alternatively, you can start
the Run Program dialog and type <tt  >konsole</tt> at the prompt.
</p><p>
For fast help with practically any Linux command from within a
terminal/shell session, you can type that command followed by the
<b  >--help</b> option. For example, if I can't remember all the command-line
options
for the ls command, which lists files and directories, I enter the
command <tt  >ls --help</tt>.
</p><p>
The <b  >--help</b> option is quick, but it doesn't work for all commands.
Even when it does work, its output can be quite terse. The best
way to get command help is by using the man
command. Man pages provide
complete instructions on how to use most Linux commands and are present
on practically all UNIX-like systems. To see the man page for the ls
command,
for example, type the command <tt  >man ls</tt>. Within the
man page listing,
press the spacebar to advance forward one page, the B key to
go back one page and type
<tt  ><i>/somestring</i></tt> to search the man
page for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>somestring</em></span>.
</p><p>
But, what if you don't know the name of the command you need? That's what
apropos is for. For example, type <tt  >apropos
list</tt> to see a variety of
commands that list things, and then pull up a man page for whichever
of those commands seem to be what you need.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d3ea0"></a>
Users, Groups and Permissions</h2></div></div><p>
Actually, two things on a Linux system aren't
represented by files, user accounts and group accounts, which
we call users and groups for short. Various files contain information
about a system's users and groups, but none of those files actually
represents them. A user account represents someone or something
capable of using files.
This is to say, both human beings and system processes can use
user accounts. For example, a user account named webmaster typically
represents a human being who maintains Web sites. But the standard Linux
user account lp is used by the line printer d&aelig;mon (lpd); the lpd
program runs as the user lp. I explain later what it means for a
program to run as one user vs. another.
</p><p>
A group account simply is a list of user accounts. Each user account is
defined with a main group membership but may in fact belong to as many
groups as needed. For example, the user maestro
may have a main group membership in conductors and also belong to
pianists.
</p><p>
A user's main group membership is specified in the user account's entry
in /etc/password. You can add that user to additional groups by editing
/etc/group and adding the user name to the end of the entry for each
group to which the user should belong. Alternatively, you could use the usermod
command; see the
usermod(8) man page for more information.
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows maestro's entry in the file /etc/password, and
Listing 2 shows part of the corresponding /etc/group file.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d4108"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. An /etc/password Entry for the User maestro</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
maestro:x:200:100:Maestro Edward Hizzersands:/home/maestro:/bin/bash
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d4318"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Two /etc/group Entries</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
conductors:x:100:
pianists:x:102:maestro,volodyia
</pre></div><p>
In Listing 1, we see that the first field contains the name of the
user account, maestro. The second field (x) is a placeholder
for maestro's password, which actually is stored in /etc/shadow.
The third field shows maestro's numeric user ID, or uid; in this
case it's 200. The fourth field shows the numeric group ID, or
gid&mdash;in this case it's 100&mdash;of maestro's main group membership. The remaining
fields specify a comment, maestro's home directory and maestro's
default login shell.
</p><p>
In Listing 2, from /etc/group, each line simply contains a group name,
a group password (usually unused&mdash;x is a placeholder), numeric
group ID (gid) and a comma-delimited list of users with secondary
memberships in the group. Thus, we see that the group conductors has a
gid of 100, which corresponds to the gid specified as maestro's main
group in Listing 1. We also see that the group pianists includes the user
maestro, plus another named volodyia, as a secondary member.
</p><p>
The simplest way to modify /etc/password and /etc/group in order to
create, modify and delete user accounts is by using the commands
useradd, usermod and userdel, respectively. I'd rather concentrate here
on concepts than command syntax, so suffice it to say that all three of
these commands can be used to set and modify group memberships and
all three commands are well documented in their respective man pages. To
see a quick usage summary, you also can type the command followed by
<b  >--help</b>, for example, <tt  >useradd --help</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d46e0"></a>
Simple File Permissions</h2></div></div><p>
Each file has two owners, a user and a
group, each with its own set of permissions that specify what the user
or group may do with the file&mdash;read it, write to it and
execute it. A third set of permissions pertains to what others,
user accounts that don't own the file or belong to the group that owns
it, can do with the file.
Listing 3 shows a long file listing for the file
/home/maestro/baton_dealers.txt.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d4840"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3: File Listing Showing Permissions</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
-rw-rw-r--  1  maestro  conductors  35414  Mar 25 01:38 baton_dealers.txt
</pre></div><p>
Permissions are listed in the order of user permissions, group permissions
and
other permissions. For the file shown in Listing 3,
its user owner (maestro) can read and write the file (rw-);
its group owner (conductors) also can read and write the file
(rw-), but other users can only read the file.
Permissions are a little more complicated, however. Users classified as
other, in terms of permissions on a particular file, can delete any file in
a directory to which they have write permissions. In other words, users
with read-only permission on a file cannot edit the file but can delete
it if they have write permission on the file's directory.
</p><p>
There's a third permission besides read and write: execute,
which is denoted by x when set. If maestro writes a shell script named
punish_bassoonists.sh and if he sets its permissions to <b  >-rwxrw-r--</b>,
he then can execute this script by entering the name
of the script at the command line. If, however, he forgets to set the
execute permission,
he is not able to run the script, even though he owns it.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x23d4bb0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Permissions and root</b></p><p>
In practical terms, file permissions simply do not apply to
the root user; root can do anything to any file, at any time. This is
why it's so important never to log on as root or use the su command
to become root, except when absolutely necessary. When you're root,
file permissions do not protect you from your own mistakes.
</p><p>
This is not to say that all programs entirely disregard
file permissions when you're root. If, for example, root tries to alter
a read-only file using the vim editor, root must use the :w! command
(force write). The normal ZZ or :w commands return an error
in this case. However, many other commands have no such sanity-check
feature.
</p></div><p>
Permissions usually are set with the chmod command, short for change
mode. Continuing with our example, suppose maestro has second thoughts
about allowing other members of the conductors group to read his list
of baton dealers. He could remove the group read/write permissions
using the commands shown in Listing 4.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x27cd170"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. Changing a File's Permissions with chmod</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ ls -l baton_dealers.txt

-rw-rw-r--  1  maestro  conductors  35414  Mar 25 01:38 baton_dealers.txt

bash-$ chmod go-rw baton_dealers.txt
bash-$ ls -l baton_dealers.txt

-rw-------  1  maestro  conductors  35414  Mar 25 01:38 baton_dealers.txt
</pre></div><p>
In Listing 4's sample chmod command (<tt  >chmod go-rw</tt>),
<tt  >go</tt> tells chmod
to change the group permissions and other permissions;
<tt  >-rw</tt>
says to remove read and write permissions for those two categories of
permissions, group and other. Thus, a chmod command has three parts: a
permission category, some combination of u, g and o or a for all;
an operator, - to remove, + to add; and a list of permissions to
add or remove, usually r, w or x.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x27cd4e0"></a>
Directory Permissions</h2></div></div><p>
We now know how to change basic permissions on regular files, but what
about directories?
Directory permissions work slightly differently from permissions on
regular files. Read and write are similar; for directories these
permissions translate to list the directory's contents and create or
delete files within the directory, respectively.
</p><p>
Execute is a little
less intuitive on directories, however. Here, execute translates to use anything
within or change working directory to this directory.
That is, if a user or group has execute permissions on a given directory,
the user or group can list that directory's contents, read that directory's files
(assuming those individual files' own permissions include this) and
change the working directory to that directory with the command
cd. If a user or group does not have execute permission on a
given directory, the user or group is unable to list or read anything in it,
regardless of the permissions set on the things inside.
If you lack execute permission on a directory but do
have read permission and you try to list its contents with ls,
you receive an error message that, in fact, lists the directory's
contents. But this doesn't work if you have neither read nor
execute permissions on the directory.
</p><p>
Suppose our example system has a user named biff who belongs to the
group drummers. Also suppose that his home directory contains
a directory called extreme_casseroles that he wishes to share with
his fellow percussionists. Listing 5 shows how biff might set that
directory's permissions.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22db580.0x27cd6f0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 5. A Group-Readable Directory</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ chmod g+rx extreme_casseroles
bash-$ ls -l extreme_casseroles

drwxr-x---  8  biff  drummers  288  Mar 25 01:38 extreme_casseroles
</pre></div><p>
Per Listing 5, only biff has the ability to create, change or delete
files inside extreme_casseroles. Other members of the group drummers
can list its contents and cd to it. Everyone else on the system, however,
is blocked from listing,
reading, cd-ing or doing anything else with the directory.

Conclusion (for Now)</h2></div></div><p>
Those are the most basic concepts and practical uses of Linux filesystem
security. In Part II, we'll go further in depth and discuss (among other
things) setuid, setgid and numeric permission modes. Until then, be safe!
