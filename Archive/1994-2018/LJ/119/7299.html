A business work system is not a family entertainment center.

fits.

Back in 1997, not long after Microsoft famously bought WebTV for $425
million US, I was approached by Dave Feinleib, then a Microsoft
executive, to write a chapter for a book he was compiling
on the coming convergence of&mdash;naturally&mdash;the Web and TV. At first
the book wasn't going to be published by Microsoft, but that's what
ended up happening. In typical Microsoft fashion (and over Dave's objections), it
was given a terrible title: <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Inside Story of Interactive TV and
Microsoft WebTV for Windows</em></span>. This title was too bad, because it
otherwise was a
good book, containing little promotional poop about Microsoft products.
</p><p>
My chapter was the biggest one in the book.
I'm glad I wrote it, because it forced a lot of thinking that
ended up in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span> (<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/book" target="_self">www.cluetrain.com/book</a>).
The concluding paragraphs of my chapter, written almost six years ago, have relevance
to the desktop focus of this month's issue:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This might look like a long shot, but I'm going to bet that the
first 50 years of TV will be the only 50 years. We'll look back on
it the way we now look back on radio's golden age. It was something
communal and friendly that brought the family together. It was a way
we could be silent together. Something of complete unimportance we
could all talk about.
</p><p>
And, to be fair, TV has always had a high quantity of good stuff.
But it also had a much higher quantity of drugs. Fred Allen was
being kind when he called it &ldquo;chewing gum for the eyes&rdquo;. It was much
worse. It made us stupid. It started us on real drugs, such as
cannabis and cocaine. It taught us that guns are the best way to
solve problems and that violence is ordinary. It disconnected us
from our families and communities and plugged us into a system that
treated us as a product to be fattened and led around blind, like
cattle.
</p><p>
Convergence of the Web and TV is inevitable. But it will happen on
the terms of the metaphors that make sense of it, such as publishing
and retailing. There is plenty of room in those metaphors&mdash;especially
marketing&mdash;for ordering and shipping entertainment
freight. The Web is a perfect way to enable the direct-demand market
for video goods that the television industry was never equipped to
provide, because it could never embrace the concept. They were in
the eyeballs-for-advertisers business. Their job was to give away
entertainment, not to charge for it. So what will we get? Gum on the
computer screen or choice on the tube?
</p><p>
It'll be no contest, especially when the form starts funding itself.
</p><p>
Bet on Web/TV, not TV/Web.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Microsoft bet the other way and lost. What they offered was Web-on-TV,
not TV-on-Web. The WebTV product was a device, plus a service, for the
tube. It failed in the marketplace. Today the brand is dead, and the
webtv.com URL redirects browsers to MSN TV, a service the site calls &ldquo;a
combination of an easy-to-use set-top box and an affordable monthly
subscription&rdquo;. The site has all the energy of a headstone.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, look at what's happening to TV.
For starters, TVs aren't tubes anymore. All the best new TVs (soon,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> TVs) are flat-panel plasma and LCD screens. They're essentially
computer monitors, only with bigger pixels and blurrier images, unless
they're displaying high definition broadcasts (which are still rare) or
DVDs (which are still merely enhanced 640&times;480 images).
</p><p>
More importantly, TV programs are simply another form of
content. That's
the lesson taught by new flat-panel monitors that include a TV tuner at
little or no extra cost. Right now CompUSA sells a tuner-equipped KOGi
17" 1280&times;1024 monitor for $399 US (after a $100 rebate). And prices are
sure to drop further by the time you read this.
</p><p>
If you want to be more than a desk potato and actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> something
with your TV input, you can put the tuner where it belongs&mdash;inside your
computer. CompUSA has TV tuner cards for less than $40 US, and there are
plenty of hacks to make them work with Linux. There also are plenty of
hacks that let your TV do TiVo-like PVR duty. See Video for Linux
(<a href="http://www.exploits.org/v4l" target="_self">www.exploits.org/v4l</a>) for piles
of information on these and other projects.
</p><p>
Although most home desktop machines still are all-purpose devices, the TV
convergence that's beginning with monitors is a harbinger of two huge
forks that are coming in the desktop computing category. The first fork is one between
home and office environments, the other is between fixed and mobile (desktop and laptop)
in both environments. The two forks are orthogonal, and the 2 &times; 2 result
is a marketplace that's fracturing into four different categories (Table
1).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1c87580.0x1d7fb30"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. The New Fractured Desktop Market</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. The New Fractured Desktop Market7299t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Home</th><th>Office</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fixed</td><td>Entertainment center</td><td>Generic desktop</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile</td><td>Home desktop replacement laptop</td><td>Road warrior notebook or laptop</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
In this new market the home PC turns into a family entertainment center&mdash;or what
Steve Jobs calls a digital lifestyle hub&mdash;and the office PC turns
into a generic desktop. The needs in each environment are so different
that there's little reason for the two even to maintain the same form
factor. Your home PC needs the backplane and connections to handle USB
and FireWire devices, game controllers, coaxial and composite video
input from your cable TV or satellite box and so forth. Your office PC
needs to be cubicleware: a monitor with a CPU that's connected to the
Net and not much more. At home your application suite includes a
potentially infinite variety of stuff. At work you need e-mail, a browser,
minimal office productivity applications and your company's arcane internal
applications. More important, for your company's sake, your cubicle's box needs
to be managed, secured and supported easily. All of which are reasons
why Linux is getting big, fast, in the generic desktop quadrant. (See
this month's <i  >LJ</i> Index for some of the huge numbers flying
around.)
</p><p>
Laptops also are getting far more capable. Not long ago, if you wanted
big storage, a large flat-screen or DVD burner, your only choice was a
desktop. Now all those features (including screens up to
1600&times;1200) are available in desktop replacement laptops. Add Wi-Fi,
standard now on most new laptops, and your home office can be
anywhere. The choice for the road warrior professional is mostly a
matter of size. And regardless of size, the trend is clear: the most
personal computers today are laptops, not desktops.
</p><p>
In the January 2004 issue, I outlined the challenges that still face Linux on
laptops. Since then a number of new Linux laptops have appeared, notably
from Lindows and Element. At this moment, Lindows (whose LindowsOS is
based on Debian) has a Laptop Edition that addresses familiar
power-management and wireless card device driver issues, and it is sold
bundled with other brands, starting at well under $1,000 US. Element is
selling a Linux Tablet for $999 US and a notebook for $799 US. More
significantly, Mike Hjorleifsson, Element's CEO, tells me his company is
working closely with VIA, NVIDIA and ATI to give Linux at least parity
performance alongside Windows and Mac laptops that use the same kinds of
devices, such as DVD and CD-RW drives. This is a significant development.
When I asked Hjorleifsson, &ldquo;Are you driving a truck through the hole
Intel left open when it neglected to release Centrino device drivers for
Linux?&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;You've got it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It's reasonable to expect the big OEMs&mdash;Dell, HP and IBM&mdash;to
continue protecting the high margins on their Windows laptops for as
long as possible by <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> marketing equally functional Linux alternatives.
And that's fine, because it leaves the market open for more ambitious
players who aren't afraid to discover the market demand we all know is
there&mdash;and not only in this one category we used to call
desktop.
