John Goerzen</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #119, March 2004</div></div><div><p>Linux laptop users, try the mail solution that
combines the advantages of fast local mail folders and a
server-based IMAP repository.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0b298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
E-mail is for many people the single-most important feature of the
Internet. We read e-mail at home, at work, while traveling and on
many different computers.
But it's difficult to see the same mail from all of those places. If you
delete a message from home, it may not show up as deleted when you
look at the same account from work. Worse, you might be able to
view a given message on only one machine. And if you sometimes want to
download mail to your laptop and read it without any
Internet connection, things get even more complex.
</p><p>
Some people try to solve these problems by using IMAP in their
mail clients. But IMAP can be slow and poorly supported; especially
on a slow connection, it
tends to make mail reading unpleasant.
I recently faced exactly this situation&mdash;I was a very annoyed
programmer. Many programs come about because a programmer somewhere was
annoyed. Thus, I wrote OfflineIMAP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0b3f8"></a>
About OfflineIMAP</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP is designed to let you read the same mailbox from many
different computers, with or without an active Internet connection. It performs a bi-directional sync, which means that
any changes you make eventually are reflected on all your
machines.
In its most common form, OfflineIMAP works by connecting to an IMAP
server and synchronizing your folders to a series of Maildir folders
on your local machine. Despite its name, OfflineIMAP is useful
even if you never read mail off-line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0b500"></a>
Installing OfflineIMAP</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP installation is easy. Visit the OfflineIMAP home page at
<a href="http://quux.org/devel/offlineimap" target="_self">quux.org/devel/offlineimap</a>, and download the .deb or
the tar.gz file. Debian users simply can run
<tt  >dpkg -i offlineimap.deb</tt> to install it, and then use
<tt  >apt-get -f install</tt> to fix
any missing dependencies.
If you're not running Debian, make sure you have Python
2.2 or above installed. If you do not have Python
already, check with your distribution or visit <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_self">www.python.org</a> to
download it.
</p><p>
When you're ready to install OfflineIMAP, run <tt  >tar -zxvf
offlineimap_4.0.2.tar.gz</tt> to unpack the source. Change into the new
directory and then, as root, run <tt  >python setup.py install</tt>.
If you get stuck, the OfflineIMAP manual contains some more installation
hints.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0b870"></a>
Basic Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP configuration is done in the ~/.offlineimaprc file. That
file has three different sections: general, which controls
overall behavior of OfflineIMAP; repository, which describes a place
where mail is stored; and account, which describes how two
repositories are synchronized together. A basic, simple setup
requires only a small configuration file. Here is an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[general]
accounts = MyMail

[Account MyMail]
localrepository = MyMailLocal
remoterepository = MyMailRemote

[Repository MyMailLocal]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/MyMail

[Repository MyMailRemote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = hostname.example.com
remoteuser = my-username-goes-here
ssl = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
This example defines one account, MyMail. The MyMail account
is synchronized from the hostname.example.com server
to the ~/MyMail directory on your local machine. All remote
folders are copied.
If your IMAP provider does not support SSL encryption, delete the
<tt  >ssl
= yes</tt> line.
Now, run <tt  >offlineimap</tt>. You are asked for your
password, and then it
synchronizes your mailboxes once and exits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0bad8"></a>
Continuous Synchronization</h2></div></div><p>
If you're connected to the Internet while you read your mail, you can
have OfflineIMAP continually keep your local tree synced up with the
server. To do this, simply add an <tt  >autorefresh</tt> line to
your account section. For instance, you might modify your account
section to look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Account MyMail]
localrepository = MyMailLocal
remoterepository = MyMailRemote
autorefresh = 5
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run OfflineIMAP now, it synchronizes your mailbox like
before. But when it's done, instead of exiting, it keeps running,
synchronizing your mail every five minutes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0bce8"></a>
Synchronizing Multiple Accounts</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP is quite capable of synchronizing multiple accounts. For
instance, you might want to be able to read mail from both your work
e-mail and your home e-mail. To do this, add one account and two repository
sections for each account, making sure to use unique names. Then,
add the account to the accounts list in the general section. Separate
the names by commas.
</p><p>
On the local side, you should make sure that each account synchronizes
into a different directory. Otherwise, confusion and corruption may
occur.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0be48"></a>
Boosting Performance</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP's defaults, as illustrated with the examples above, are
quite conservative. It tries to work with as many IMAP servers as
possible right out of the box, so the advanced features that
occasionally cause trouble are disabled by default.
</p><p>
If you have many mail folders or get a lot of mail in each folder, the
synchronization process can be slow. This is especially true if you
are using a high-latency Internet connection, such as a modem or
satellite.
To speed things up, OfflineIMAP is capable of establishing multiple
connections to your server at once. It then is able to perform tasks in
parallel. For instance, OfflineIMAP might download three messages and
synchronize two folders simultaneously.
</p><p>
OfflineIMAP offers several configuration options. First, you
should add a line such as <tt  >maxsyncaccounts = 5</tt> to your general
section. This enables OfflineIMAP to synchronize multiple accounts
simultaneously, which is almost always a good thing.
Second, in the repository section for the remote part of each
account, you can control how much parallelism to use. For instance,
you might add a line saying <tt  >maxconnections = 3</tt> to the MyMailRemote
repository section in our example. This allows OfflineIMAP to
establish up to three connections to the server.
</p><p>
If you are performing continuous syncs with the
autorefresh option
described above, there's another source for delay. Each time
OfflineIMAP starts syncing an account, it connects to the server.
When it's done with that particular sync, it disconnects.
Establishing these connections can be slow in many cases.
OfflineIMAP provides an option to keep the connections
open even between syncs. The problem is that some servers
disconnect clients that are idle for a long time. To combat that
problem, OfflineIMAP also can send little bits of traffic every so
often to make sure the timers don't expire. To take advantage of
these features, add lines like these to the remote repository section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
holdconnectionopen = true
keepalive = 60
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0c160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Keepalive is given in seconds, whereas autorefresh is given
in minutes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0c268"></a>
User Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP ships with many different user interfaces. The two most
common are Tk.Blinkenlights and Curses.Blinkenlights. The former
presents a small graphical window on OfflineIMAP's progress on your
X desktop. The latter runs in a terminal and provides a nice monitor
of progress (see Figures 1 and 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7232f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Tk.Blinkenlights GUI Interface for OfflineIMAP
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7232f2.large.jpg"><img src="7232f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Curses.Blinkenlights Interface, Running in a Terminal Window
</p></div></div><p>
With the Tk.Blinkenlights interface, you can click on the Sync
immediately button to force the account to synchronize right away.
You can do the same thing in the Curses.Blinkenlights interface by
pressing the number next to the account name.
Both interfaces display a log of current activities. You also get a
mesmerizing display of flashing status lights so you won't get bored
while watching the synchronization happen.
</p><p>
The TTY.TTYUI interface can run without any Curses support&mdash;it uses
no color or terminal controls. It can read password input, but it
provides no other capabilities for interaction.
</p><p>
Noninteractive.Basic is a user interface designed never to receive any
input from the user. It can, however, display status messages. If
you need a password in order to log in to a remote server, add a line
such as <tt  >remotepass = mypassword</tt> to the remote
repository section of
the configuration file.
</p><p>
Finally, Noninteractive.Quiet goes one step further and does not
output status messages. Some people like to run OfflineIMAP from a
cron job, and Noninteractive.Quiet is good for that.
</p><p>
You can specify which user interface should be used in one of two ways. First, you
can use the -u option on the OfflineIMAP command line. For instance,
you might run <tt  >offlineimap -u Curses.Blinkenlights</tt>.
Alternatively, you can add a ui line to your general section,
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ui = Tk.Blinkenlights, Curses.Blinkenlights,
     TTY.TTYUI
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0c9a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With this configuration, OfflineIMAP first tries the
Tk.Blinkenlights interface. If your Python doesn't support Tk, or if you
are not running under X, it then tries the Curses.Blinkenlights
interface. If that too fails, the TTY.TTYUI interface is tried. If
even that does not work, OfflineIMAP aborts with an error.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0caa8"></a>
Selecting Folders</h2></div></div><p>
By default, OfflineIMAP asks your remote IMAP server which folders are
available to you and synchronizes all of them. A
folderfilter option can be added to your remote repository section
to restrict what is brought over.
The folderfilter option is a tremendously powerful option. Unlike the
other options you've seen so far, folderfilter actually expects to be
handed a Python function. The function takes one argument and should
return true if that folder is to be included.
</p><p>
Python provides a feature called lambda that lets you create simple
functions on the fly. You thus can construct some complex
rules. Here are a few examples.
You can specify a set of folders you want to synchronize. You can use
the Python in operator to test whether the folder in question is in the
list, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername in
      ['INBOX', 'Sent Mail',
       'Received']
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2b0cc60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This code synchronizes only the three named folders. Notice the
indentation on the second and third lines&mdash;if you indent them, the
configuration parser treats them as part of a single statement.
</p><p>
You also can specify folders to exclude:

<pre     class="programlisting">
folderfilter = lambda foldername: foldername not in
      ['Spam', 'Junk']
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2f05068"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this example, all folders except Spam and Junk are
synchronized.
</p><p>
You also can use regular expressions, such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
folderfilter = lambda foldername:
     not re.search('(^Trash$|Del)', foldername)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2f05220"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This input causes the folder named Trash and all folders containing the
text Del to be excluded.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2f05328"></a>
Changing Folder Names</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes, you may want to alter the folder names before storing the
folders on the local side. OfflineIMAP provides an option called
nametrans, also specified in the remote repository section, to do exactly
that. Some IMAP servers, such as Courier, add &ldquo;INBOX.&rdquo; to the start of
all folders, which can be annoying. The nametrans feature lets you
get rid of that. Here's an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nametrans = lambda foldername:
   re.sub('^INBOX\.', '', foldername)
</pre>
</p><p>
Like folderfilter, nametrans takes a Python expression. This
expression receives a folder name as an argument and should return
the new and improved folder name. In this example, any folder whose
name starts with INBOX. gets the leading
INBOX. removed.
It's important to remove not only the leading INBOX; the folder
INBOX itself does exist, so you'd wind up with an empty folder name
(and that's a bad thing).
</p><p>
It's also important to be careful with your nametrans rules. You must
make sure that nametrans returns a different value for each folder.
If it returns the same thing for two different folders, bad things
can happen.
</p><p>
In case you're wondering, nametrans does not change folderfilter.
That is, your folderfilter rules operate on the folder names before
nametrans takes effect.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a13580.0x2f055e8"></a>
Synchronizing Two IMAP Servers</h2></div></div><p>
Some mail readers don't support Maildir hierarchies well. For them,
OfflineIMAP introduced a new feature: the ability to synchronize two
IMAP servers directly.
The idea is this: you install an IMAP server on your local
machines. Your mail reader, which already may have slow IMAP support,
is fairly speedy in accessing an IMAP server located on your own
machine. The mail reader never needs to know that OfflineIMAP
is sticking the messages in the folders.
</p><p>
To make this happen, you need to make a few simple changes to
your local repository section. First, change the type from Maildir to
IMAP. Secondly, remove the localfolders and other Maildir
information and instead specify IMAP configurations, such as remotehost
and remoteuser. Finally, delete your ~/.offlineimap directory to make
sure that none of the old status information lingers around.
</p><p>
Certain options still are supported only in the remote
section&mdash;nametrans and folderfilter are two examples&mdash;but the
options relating to the connection itself are supported in both places.
You can, in fact, have your local IMAP server on a machine that
is remote to you.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OfflineIMAP is a powerful mail solution. I've introduced you to the
basics of OfflineIMAP in this article, but there still is more you can
do with it. To learn more, check out the OfflineIMAP home page and the
example configuration files. If you're a Python programmer, you'll
find some nice hooks for Python code as well.
