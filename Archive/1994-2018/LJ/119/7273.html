Our readers' favorite audio tool offers some
advanced features you can use to customize your listening
experience.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x195f580.0x1a572f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
XMMS (the X MultiMedia System) is a feature-rich multimedia
player that has won the <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s Readers' Choice Award
for Favorite Audio Tool for the past four years. I assume, then, that the program needs little introduction here.
</p><p>
Most users of the program probably use it to play MP3s,
but its default range of supported file formats also includes
OGG, WAV, CD audio and all formats supported by the MikMod
music module player. Thanks to various third-party
input plugins, XMMS also can play almost every available audio and
video format, as we soon shall see. Supported audio output
formats include ALSA, OSS, esd and aRts. It also has a driver
for writing audio output to disk in the WAV sound file format,
which is quite handy for converting sound files for burning to
an audio CD.
</p><p>
But, XMMS is more than a versatile player. This brief article
dives a little deeper into the program to expose some of its extended
features, such as its equalizer and playlist capabilities, as well as some
interesting and useful third-party plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x195f580.0x1a57500"></a>
Basics</h2></div></div><p>
XMMS is divided into three panels: the player, a graphic
equalizer and a playlist window. The player contains the
expected transport controls as well as sliders for volume and
balance, or pan position. Another larger slider controls a
pointer for random access into the file being played. Toggles
are provided for the other panels, and switches control song
looping and random playback.
</p><p>
The graphic equalizer (EQ) presents 11 sliders, one for preamp gain
(+/&ndash; 20db), the others for boosting or cutting audio frequencies in
ten bands (channels). Ten channels provide decent basic equalization,
with starting frequencies at 60, 170, 310, 600, 1k, 3k, 6k, 12k, 14k
and 16k Hertz. These numbers indicate the throw (movement range),
for each slider ranges from 100 up to 6,000 Hertz, which is rather
coarse-grained, but the sliders are nicely responsive with smooth
real-time audio updating. The default equalizer is fine for most desktop
audio listening, but for finer resolution you can try Felipe Rivera's
graphic EQ plugin that can be configured for 10, 15, 25 or 31 bands
(see this article's Resources for links to all software discussed).
</p><p>
The playlist panel displays the files to be played and provides a number
of useful file controls. The buttons on the lower left add and delete files
from the list, make and sort selections and open an ID3 editor for the
information tag attached to an MP3. The playlist window also includes
a set of transport controls identical to those in the player panel,
along with indicators for elapsed time during file play and for total
time of the playlist. Finally, the List button on the lower right lets you
load a new playlist, blank out the current list or save the contents of
the playlist to a new file. Playlists are plain-text files in the
common M3U playlist format, meaning the entries are simply paths to the
included files. The playlist is quite flexible
and accommodates any
file type supported by XMMS and its plugins.

A Little More Advanced</h2></div></div><p>
Let's take a peek at some of these plugins. XMMS utilizes
plugins for file I/O, special effects, visualization and a
general
category. For the purpose of this article, I focus on only a few I/O
and effects plugins.
</p><p>
Erik de Castro Lopo's libsndfile has taken its place as the preferred
sound file I/O library for such projects as the Ardour digital audio
workstation and the MusE audio/MIDI sequencer. Erik's libxmms_sndfile
plugin expands XMMS' sound file support to a wider variety of sound file
types, including AIFF, AU/SND, IRCAM SF and many others. Nandan Dixit's
libxmmsmplayer plugin adds the ability to play any video file format
supported by the MPlayer video playback engine, extending XMMS' file
support to MPEG, ASF, AVI, MOV and other video formats. Nick Lamb's
ladspa.so is in fact a plugin to host plugins. LADSPA (the Linux Audio
Developers Simple Plugin API) is an interface designed for creating
simple but powerful audio processing plugins. Ladspa.so brings dozens of
interesting effects to XMMS, all usable during real-time playback. Figure
1 shows off XMMS with a playlist containing sound files in five formats
(AIFF, AU, MP3, OGG and WAV); movies in MPEG, AVI and RM formats (yes,
the MPlayer plugin handles RealVideo too); and the LADSPA plugin at work
lending its plate reverb and retro flanger to the XMMS audio processing
functions.

Finale</h2></div></div><p>
That's all for this preview of some of XMMS' advanced features. Big
thanks to the main development team for creating and maintaining XMMS,
to the whole crew of third-party plugin developers for their wonderful
expansions and to 4Front Technologies for its support of this most
excellent Linux multimedia software.
