VA Research was, for a time, the best place I ever
worked. Shortly after I started there, then-CEO Larry Augustin
made it clear that one of the things he wanted me to do was
manage the company's relationship with the Linux community.
We started by collecting old machines
and handing out accounts to
developer groups.
</p><p>
Whether it was the Free Software Foundation,
Debian or Stampede, we simply wanted people to know they had a
place to go when their bandwidth demands exceeded the limits
set by their ISPs.
This worked pretty well for a while, until the number of
machines on which we were hosting projects started numbering
around 40 and the extra load started taking its toll on our
system administrators. Around this time, Tony Guntharp,
Tim Perdue, Uriah Welcome and
others locked themselves in a room with a few pallets of SCSI
drives and
68 days later,
introduced the world to SourceForge.net.
</p><p>
Tony and his colleagues expected about 1,000 people on
the site by the end of the year, but they had over 5,000 by the
end of that first month. The growth wasn't showing any sign
of slowing down. There was pressure from some
of the executives and board members to shut down the site due to
cost concerns. Luckily for
the site and for the future of VA, those concerns were held back by the work of
people like Larry Augustin and Steve Westmoreland. The code
of the SourceForge site was developed much like many of the projects on
the site under the GPL.
</p><p>
Then, VA got a new CEO and went out of the
hardware business. GPL releases of the code stopped dead,
and installing SourceForge on-site became the business of the
company. Along with this change, the company decided to go
proprietary.
</p><p>
The nature of the GPL meant the code base still was out
there. After about three months, Tim Perdue, who was part of
the original team, went to work and released GForge, a new
version for those who were looking to maintain their own or
their customers' SourceForge-like sites.
At this point, in the interest of full
disclosure, I should note that the company Tony Guntharp, Steve
Westmoreland and I started, Konstrux Technologies, installs
and maintains these kinds of sites for our customers. We base
this business on GForge; Tim Perdue and others
have similar businesses.
</p><p>
SourceForge.net is a fantastic resource and continues to be;
OSDN and VA should be remembered and thanked for that. I don't
mean to rail against their decision to go proprietary, as I'm sure
they felt they had good reasons to do so.</p><p>
But they were wrong. From a customer and vendor perspective,
sticking with a completely open-source solution is wildly
advantageous. I do understand the profits to be gained from
proprietary software, and I even believe there are places
where proprietary software is likely to remain ahead of open-source software.
If you measure the success of a code base by
features, however, open-source software is the winner. Since
forking off from SourceForge, GForge has added
full administrative and installation
documentation, significant code and UI clean up, XML interfacing
and an installer.
</p><p>
But from the customer or vendor perspective, the advantages
of open-source software too often are forgotten. Our company had
a customer who needed a role-based authentication system
added onto GForge. While we were writing a statement of work
for a contract to add this piece, a programmer who had implemented a
similar system at Mitre submitted a patch to do 90% of what
the customer wanted. We were able to meet the needs
of a customer without bringing on more employees, spreading
ourselves too thin or charging too much. We thus were able to
compete against proprietary vendors who were much larger than us.
</p><p>
From a customer perspective, open source is the greatest
insurance policy an IT department can have.
In the unlikely event Konstrux should go out of business,
our customers wouldn't find themselves with a collaborative
development site they can't maintain. This is not
something that can be said about our competitors. If they
go out of business, that code becomes part of the bankruptcy
auction and their customers may be left high and dry. Through
open source, customers can protect their
investments in information technology. This fact is obvious to
open-source software veterans, but I think that people need
to remember this is one of the freedoms with which we're
concerned.
</p><p>
The Free Software Foundation tends to speak in terms of individual liberties,
but their ideals extend nicely to business, giving companies
the freedom to run their own IT departments and
to preserve their business systems without being held hostage
by hostile vendors or the courts.
