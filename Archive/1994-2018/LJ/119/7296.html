An application-level proxy blocks the widest possible range
of network attacks but is more complex than a packet filter.
Is the trade-off worth it?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2778580.0x28702f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At first glance, stateful packet filtering appears to have
conquered the firewall world, both in terms of market share
and mind share. The list of products based on stateful
packet filtering is a long one, and it includes both the
proprietary industry leader, Check Point Firewall-1, and Linux's excellent
Netfilter kernel code.
</p><p>
But what about application-layer proxies? Professional
firewall engineers have long insisted there's nothing like an
application-aware proxy for blocking the widest possible range
of network attacks. Indeed, being such a person myself, I've
been disheartened to see application-layer proxies increasingly
marginalized. In some circles they've even been written off as obsolete
for reasons that simply don't warrant, in my opinion, the loss
of a powerful security tool. Marketing is at least as big a
reason as any other.
</p><p>
Apparently I'm not alone in my opinion. Balazs Scheidler, creator of the
essential logging facility Syslog-NG, has created Zorp,
an open-source proxy firewall product that is
simply brilliant. This month I explain why
Zorp has helped resuscitate my faith in the application-layer
proxy firewall, and what this means for anyone charged with
protecting highly sensitive networks.

Firewall Refresher Course</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, some of you may be asking, &ldquo;What
are application-layer proxying and stateful inspection? And why
do I care which is better?&rdquo; I can explain. Feel free to skip
ahead to the next section if you're a grizzled firewall veteran.
</p><p>
A firewall, of course, is a computer or embedded hardware
device that separates different networks from one another and
regulates what traffic may pass between them. The instructions
that determine which network nodes may send what type of
network packets and where are called firewall rules or,
collectively, the firewall policy.
</p><p>
These rules are what make a firewall different from an ordinary
router. Routers must be programmed to know how to move
packets from one network to another, but not necessarily
whether to allow them to move in any given way. A
firewall, on the other hand, discriminates.
</p><p>
One very simple way to categorize packets is by the Internet
information in packets' Internet Protocol (IP) headers. An IP header
contains basic information, most importantly, protocol
type, source and destination addresses, and, if applicable, source
and destination ports. The ports actually are part of the next
header down in the packet, the UDP header or TCP header. A
firewall that looks only at this basic information is called a
simple packet filter. Because simple packet filters don't look
deeply into each packet, they tend to be quite fast.
</p><p>
However, the IP header of a packet plus its TCP or UDP
port number tells us nothing about that packet's relationship
to other packets. For example, if we examine the IP header of
an HTTP packet, we know it's a TCP packet (thanks to the IP
field), where it's from and where it's going (source and
destination IP address fields) and what type of application sent it
(from the destination port, TCP 80). Table 1 shows an example
simple packet-filtering rule.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2778580.0x2870768"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Simple Packet Filter Rules for HTTP</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Simple Packet Filter Rules for HTTP7296t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Source IP</th><th>Destination IP</th><th>Protocol</th><th>Source Port</th><th>Destination Port</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any</td><td>192.168.1.1</td><td>TCP</td><td>Any</td><td>80</td><td>Allow</td></tr><tr><td>192.168.1.1</td><td>Any</td><td>TCP</td><td>80</td><td>Any</td><td>Allow</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
But that level of inspection leaves out some key pieces of information
about the HTTP connection: whether the packet is establishing a new HTTP
session, whether it's part of a session in progress or whether it's
simply a random, possibly hostile, packet not correlating to anything
at all. This information is left out because crucial session-related information such as TCP
flags, TCP sequence numbers and application-level commands, all
are contained deeper within the packet than a packet filter digs. That's
where stateful packet filtering comes in.
</p><p> A stateful packet filter, like a simple packet filter,
begins by examining each packet's source and destination
IP addresses, and source and destination ports. But it also
digs deeper into the packet's UDP or TCP header to determine
whether the packet is initiating a new connection. If it is,
the firewall creates an entry for the new connection in a
state table. If it isn't, the stateful packet filter checks the
packet against the state table to see if it
belongs to an existing connection. A stateful packet filter
will
block packets that pretend
to be part of an existing connection, but aren't. Actually,
UDP is connectionless, but a good stateful firewall can guess
that an outbound DNS query to a given server on UDP 53 should
be followed by an inbound response from that server's UDP port
53. Stateful packet filtering has two main benefits over simple
packet filtering. </p><p>
First, firewall rules can be simpler. Rather than needing to
describe both directions of each bi-directional transaction,
such as HTTP, firewall rules need address only the
initiation of each allowed transaction. Subsequent
packets belonging to established, allowed connections
can be handled by the firewall's state table, independently
of explicit rules. In Table 2 we see that only one rule is
needed to allow the same HTTP transaction for which we needed
two rules in Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2778580.0x28711b8"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. Stateful Packet Filter Rule for HTTP</b></p><table     summary="Table 2. Stateful Packet Filter Rule for HTTP7296t2.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Source IP</th><th>Destination IP</th><th>Protocol</th><th>Source Port</th><th>Destination Port</th><th>State</th><th>Action</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any</td><td>192.168.1.1</td><td>TCP</td><td>Any</td><td>80</td><td>New</td><td>Allow</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
The second main benefit of stateful packet filtering is we don't
have to do such distasteful things as allowing all inbound TCP and UDP
packets from the Internet to enter our internal network if they have a
destination port higher than 1024. This is the sort of thing you
sometimes must do if you don't have a better way to correlate packets with
allowed transactions. In other words, stateful packet filtering provides
better security than simple packet filtering.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Cool&rdquo;, you say, &ldquo;stateful packet filters are more
efficient and secure&rdquo;, which is true. But what about the
things even stateful packet filters don't consider? What about things like
potentially malformed HTTP commands or intentionally overlapping
IP fragments? Might there be a type of firewall that examines
each packet in its entirety or that has some other
means of propagating the fewest anomalous packets
possible?
</p><p>
Indeed there is, and it's called an application-layer proxy or
application-layer gateway. Whereas packet filters, whether simple
or stateful, examine all packets and pass those that are allowed,
an application-layer proxy breaks each attempted connection into
two, inserting itself in the middle of each transaction as an equal
participant. To the client or initiator in each transaction, the
firewall acts as the server. To the intended destination, or server,
the firewall acts as the client.
</p><p>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this difference. In Figure 1, we see that the
stateful packet filter passes or blocks transactions but ultimately is an
observer in that it passes allowed packets more or less intact, unless,
for example, it performs network address translation (NAT). In contrast,
in Figure 2 we see that the firewall terminates each allowed
connection to itself and initiates a new, proxied connection to each
allowed connection's desired actual endpoint.

</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7296f1.large.jpg"><img src="7296f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. With a stateful packet filter, packets flow directly from
client to server, provided they match either an allow rule or
a state-table entry.

Figure 2. With an application-layer proxy, the connection is split in two.
To the client, the firewall appears to be the server (transaction #1). To the server, the firewall appears to be the client (transaction #2).
</p></div></div><p>
Proxying comes in two flavors, transparent and nontransparent. In a
transparently proxied connection, both parties are unaware that the
connection is being proxied; the client system addresses its packets
as though there were no firewall, with their true destination
IP address.
By contrast, in a nontransparently proxied connection the client
must address its packets to the firewall rather than to their true
destinations. Because the client must, in that case, somehow tell the
firewall where to proxy the connection, nontransparent proxying
requires clients to run proxy-aware applications. Although most
Web browsers and FTP clients can be configured to use a nontransparent
proxy, transparent proxies are easier for end users to live
with than are nontransparent proxies. Modern application-layer proxies,
such as
Zorp, are transparent.
</p><p>
Transparent or not, proxying has several important
ramifications. First, low-level anomalies, such as strange flags in
the IP header, generally are not propagated by the firewall.
The firewall initiates the secondary connection in the way that it,
not the client system, considers an acceptable manner.
Second, because the firewall is re-creating the client connection in its
entirety and not merely propagating or trivially rewriting individual
packets, the firewall is well positioned to examine the connection at
the application layer. This is not a given, however; if the
firewall is, say, a SOCKS firewall and not a true application-layer proxy,
it simply could copy the data payloads of the client connection packets
into those of the new, proxied packets. But if the firewall is
application-aware, like Zorp is, the firewall not only examines
but makes decisions about the data payloads of all client packets.
</p><p>
Let's look at an example: suppose your public Web server is vulnerable to a
buffer-overflow exploit that involves a malformed HTTP GET command
containing, say, an abnormally long URL. Your application-layer proxy
firewall initially accepts the connection from the client, but upon
examining the long URL, closes the connection with an error message
to the client and a reset to the server, without ever forwarding the
attack payload, the long URL.
</p><p>
The third ramification isn't a positive one: by definition,
proxying is more resource-intensive than is packet filtering,
and application-aware proxying is especially so. This strike
against application-layer proxies is, however, generally
overstated. Zorp, for example, can proxy 88Mbps worth of HTTP traffic, nearly twice the capacity of a T-3
WAN connection, running on only a 700MHz Celeron system with
128MB of RAM. Zorp, on a dual-processor Pentium system with 512MB of RAM
and SCSI RAID hard drives, can handle around 480Mbps,
according to the Zorp Professional v2 Product Description,
available at <a href="http://www.balabit.com" target="_self">www.balabit.com</a>.
</p><p>
In summary, application-layer proxies provide superior protection by
inserting themselves in the middle of each network transaction they allow
by re-creating all packets from scratch and by making intelligent
decisions on what application-layer commands and data to propagate. They
accomplish this
based on their knowledge about how those applications are supposed to
work, not merely on how their container packets ought to look. The main
strike against application-layer proxies is performance, but thanks
primarily to Moore's Law, this shortcoming is mitigated amply by fast
but not necessarily expensive hardware.
</p><p>
In the interest of full disclosure, I should mention one other
shortcoming that many people perceive in application-layer proxies,
greater complexity. It stands to reason that because application-layer
proxies are more sophisticated than packet filters, it should take more
sophistication to configure them, in the same way that you need to know
more to operate a Mosler safe than to operate your typical bus station
locker. It's more work to configure a firewall running Zorp or Secure
Computing Sidewinder than it is to configure one running Check Point
Firewall-1 or Linux Netfilter/iptables.
</p><p>
But isn't better security worth a little extra work? Like everything else
in information security, it's up to you to choose your own trade-off.
Maybe the extra work is worth it to you, and maybe it isn't. Either way,
I hope this column makes you glad you've got the choice in the first place.
The remainder of this article, which
continues with at least one more installment, explains precisely
what's involved in configuring and using Zorp.

Getting and Installing Zorp</h2></div></div><p>
The proxy d&aelig;mons that comprise Zorp run on top of the
Linux kernel concurrently with the standard Netfilter and
Balabit-provided TPROXY kernel modules. In theory, this makes
Zorp distribution-agnostic, and it's designed to compile cleanly
on any Linux distribution that meets certain requirements
(see below).
Zorp is developed on Debian Linux, however, and the vast
majority of Zorp documentation assumes that you're running
Debian too. In fact, Zorp GPL is an official Debian package (as
of this writing, in Debian's testing and unstable releases).
</p><p>
Zorp is available in three versions: Zorp GPL, the free GPLed
version; Zorp Unofficial, a cutting-edge or beta version
of Zorp GPL; and Zorp Professional (or simply Zorp Pro),
a commercial product based on but with more features than
Zorp GPL.
If you purchase Zorp Pro, you get a bootable CD-ROM that
installs not only Zorp Pro but ZorpOS,
a stripped-down Debian distribution optimized for Zorp.
With Zorp Pro, a bare-metal Zorp installation takes less
than 15 minutes, excluding subsequent configuration,
of course. Anyone who's suffered through lengthy dselect
sessions while trying to install just enough Debian for one's
needs can appreciate the beauty of this.
</p><p>
Zorp Pro also includes the new Zorp Management Server (ZMS),
which allows you to manage multiple Zorp firewalls from
a central management host. The host in turn can be operated
remotely with ZMC, a GUI client available in both Debian Linux
and Windows versions. ZMS is functionally equivalent to Check
Point Firewall-1's management module, arguably
the biggest reason Check Point has conquered the enterprise
firewall world. ZMS has the potential to make Zorp very
attractive indeed to sites with a lot of firewalls to manage.
</p><p>
ZMS/ZMC is still a little rough around the edges&mdash;Balabit isn't
expecting to release a consumer-installable version of that part of
Zorp Pro in March 2004 (though at the time of this writing it is being
used,
successfully, by paying customers). Even if you don't use
ZMS/ZMC, Zorp Pro's smooth installation and wide range of features,
including several application proxies not supported in Zorp GPL, make
Zorp Professional worthwhile.
</p><p>
Unlike Zorp Pro, Zorp GPL and Zorp Unofficial require a working Linux
installation that includes the following: glib 2.0,
Python 2.1, libcap 1.10 and openssl 0.9.6g.
It also requires either
a Linux 2.2 kernel compiled with IP, firewalling and transparent
proxy support or
a Linux 2.4 kernel compiled with iptables, iptables connection
tracking, iptables NAT and, using Balabit's TPROXY kernel patch
(<a href="http://www.balabit.com/products/oss/tproxy" target="_self">www.balabit.com/products/oss/tproxy</a>), iptables transparent
proxying. All of these features should be compiled as modules.
</p><p>
Once your OS is ready, you either can install Zorp GPL from
binary deb packages or compile Zorp GPL from source code
(available at <a href="http://www.balabit.com/downloads" target="_self">www.balabit.com/downloads</a>). Compiling Zorp
GPL is a little more involved than your typical ./configure make make install routine; see the Zorp GPL Tutorial
at <a href="http://www.balabit.com/products/zorp_gpl/tutorial" target="_self">www.balabit.com/products/zorp_gpl/tutorial</a> for
detailed instructions.
</p><p>
Next time, I'll describe how to set up Zorp GPL to protect a typical
Internet&mdash;DMZ&mdash;Trusted Network topology.
