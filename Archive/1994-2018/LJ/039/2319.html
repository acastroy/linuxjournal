    We continue to improve our quiz file program, by adding an
    editor.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc2c580.0xd24348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we continued looking at ways
to improve the user interface of our CGI quiz engine. This engine
is based on the <b  >QuizQuestions.pm</b> Perl module and
allows us to create a number of different multiple-choice quizzes.
Each quiz is stored in a separate ASCII text file on the server's
file system, and thanks to the abstraction layer provided by the
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> object, we are able to ignore the
way in which the information is stored and focus on the quiz
itself.
</p><p>Or can we? As we saw last month, it is relatively easy for us
to create a quiz using HTML forms and a CGI program. Indeed, we
created such a program without much trouble; still, as I pointed
out at the end of last month's column, our job is only half done.
Using an HTML form and CGI program simplifies the process of
creating quiz files and reduces the potential for error. However,
of someone wants to modify a quiz that he has already created, he
still has to understand our file format and make sure not to
disturb it. It would be nice to have a single program which allowed
users to create and modify their quizzes, saving them from having
to work directly with quiz files.</p><p>Such a program would be desirable for its error-free,
user-friendly quiz creation. We use text files to store information
with tabs or other special characters separating fields within a
given record. Fewer problems will ensue if we can provide a
graphical interface that restricts the type of data that our users
can input. In addition, a quiz editor would empower the designers
and producers on our site&mdash;who, at an increasing number of sites,
are kept separate from the technical staff responsible for creating
CGI programs and keeping the network up and running. While you
might be an experienced system administrator who knows the
difference between tabs and spaces and doesn't flinch before
editing /etc/fstab or a Makefile, most content-oriented people on a
site are not experienced users. If we can provide a tool that
creates and modifies quizzes without the need to learn Emacs, come
to us with questions or tear their hair out in frustration, then
why not?</p><p>Last month, we looked at a simple program,
<b  >create-quizfile.pl</b>, which took information from
an HTML form and correctly formed it into a quiz file. This month,
we take the basic idea behind that quiz creator and look at how we
can write a quiz editor. That is, our new program will allow us to
create quizzes, just as the previous one did, but will also let us
edit quizzes by modifying the text of questions and answers or
deleting existing questions from the quiz file.</p><p>From the above description it seems as though our basic unit
of operation is a line of text in the quiz file that will contain a
question. The easiest way to handle these data is to keep track of
them in an array of strings, which we call
<b  >@lines</b>. This means <b  >$lines[0]</b>
is the first non-comment, non-whitespace line in the quiz file&mdash;in
other words, the first set of questions and answers. For example,
to find the third answer to the fifth question, we call up
<b  >$lines[4]</b>, split it across tabs using Perl's
&ldquo;split&rdquo; operator, and read the fourth element of that array. Each
line of the quiz file is of the format <span   class="emphasis"><em>question answer1
answer2 answer3 answer4 correctAnswer</em></span>, with each field
separated from its neighbor by a tab character. Each line of the
quiz file can be represented by a string containing the tabs or by
a list created by splitting the string across the tab
character.</p><p>Luckily, we don't have to think much about the format of the
quiz file, thanks to the <b  >QuizQuestions</b> object
module we have used so far. When we create a new instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b>, we effectively create a new,
blank quiz. To add questions to that quiz, we use the
<b  >addQuestion</b> method, which expects to receive six
arguments&mdash;not surprisingly, the same arguments as appear on each
line of the quiz file.</p><p>To create a brand-new quiz our program, called
<b  >edit-quiz.pl</b>, must create an HTML form
containing elements into which the user can enter one or more
questions and answers. To edit an old quiz file,
<b  >edit-quizfile.pl</b> has to create an instance of
<b  >QuizFile</b> corresponding to a quiz file already
existing on disk. It then must read the questions from that quiz
file, turning each question into a set of HTML form elements. This
lets the user edit the questions and answers, delete existing
questions and add new ones.</p><p>But wait a second&mdash;if <b  >edit-quizfile.pl</b> is
going to create the HTML form that the user will use for editing a
quiz, which program will take the contents of this form and
actually do something with it? After all, CGI programs are single
operations: they receive input, perform some processing and produce
output. It seems if our program produces an HTML form as output, it
cannot also accept input from that form and save it to disk. The
secret here is that <b  >edit-quizfile.pl</b> can accept
its own input by expecting to be invoked twice. On the first
invocation, it creates the form to be used to edit quizzes, and on
the second invocation, it saves the submitted data in the form of a
quiz. Our program thus performs two different actions on two
distinct occasions.</p><p>Why not simply write two separate programs, one to display
the form and a second to process it? We certainly could have
handled it in this way, but this would restrict us to a single
iteration of editing. By keeping all of the quiz-editing features
within a single program we can create an editing loop that allows
us more than a one-shot deal. We can reuse the code for displaying
the current state of the quiz file, because we always display the
quiz's file state when our program is invoked. By keeping all the
code within one program and simply putting the display code at the
bottom of this program, everything becomes a bit easier to
understand and maintain.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc2c580.0xd24c38"></a>Displaying the Quiz</h2></div></div><p>Before we get to work coding, let's figure out how all of
this works. We invoke <b  >edit-quiz.pl</b> in a number
of different ways, using both <b  >GET</b> (i.e.,
entering its URL in a browser window or clicking on a hyperlink
within a page of HTML) and <b  >POST</b> (i.e., when we
click on a <b  >submit</b> button at the bottom of an
HTML form).</p><p>If <b  >edit-quiz.pl</b> is invoked using
<b  >GET</b> without any arguments, we are asked which
quiz we wish to create or edit. Entering the name of the quiz file
and pressing Return submits it to the program, which then receives
this argument&mdash;again using <b  >GET</b>--in the query
string.</p><p>The query string, for those of you relatively new to CGI
programming, is the term for anything following the question mark
in a URL. It allows the passing of simple arguments to a CGI
program without having to use <b  >POST</b>, a more
complicated and sophisticated protocol for passing information.
Thus, if someone invokes the program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.fictional.edu/cgi-bin/program.pl
</pre><p>the query string is null, because there is no argument. But
if someone invokes the CGI program:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.fictional.edu/cgi-bin/program.pl?foobar
</pre>


the argument is <b  >foobar</b>. If we are using
<b  >CGI.pm</b>, a Perl module for writing CGI programs
(available from CPAN at http://www.perl.com/CPAN), we can
theoretically retrieve the contents of the query string using the
<b  >query_string</b> method, as in:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $query = new CGI;
my $query_string = $query-&gt;query_string;
</pre>


For reasons that I don't completely understand, the
<b  >query_string</b> method returns the query string
with a prepended <b  >keywords=</b>, as if the query
string had been submitted to our CGI program in an HTML form
element named <b  >keywords</b>. While this can sometimes
come in handy, for the most part, I find it a surprising quirk in
an otherwise excellent package.
</p><p>If <b  >CGI.pm</b> is going to treat the query
string as a parameter named <b  >keywords</b>, we have to
retrieve its value in the same way as we would other parameters,
namely:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $query = new CGI;
my $query_string = $query-&gt;param("keywords");
</pre><p>which might seem a bit odd at first, but you get used to it.
</p><p>We determine whether our program was invoked via
<b  >GET</b> or <b  >POST</b> using the method
<b  >request_method</b> within <b  >CGI.pm</b>.
In other words, we can do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $query = new CGI;
my $request_method = $query-7gt;request_method;
</pre><p>At this point, the variable
<b  >$request_method</b> contains either the string
<b  >GET</b> or <b  >POST</b>, depending on how
the program was invoked. The main difference between these two
invocation methods is how arguments are passed to the program:
<b  >GET</b> sends all of the variable values in the
query string, while <b  >POST</b> sends them via stdin,
the file handle associated with standard input. Luckily, CGI.pm
frees us from having to deal with these methods and invisibly hands
us the parameters regardless of their source.
</p><p>In any event, if our program is invoked with any value in the
query string, we print out an HTML form containing the contents of
the quiz file with that name or a blank HTML form allowing the user
to create a quiz of that name. You can see that program in
<a href="2319l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>There are several things to note in this program. First of
all, we need to tell the program the maximum number of questions
that each quiz can contain. We do this by setting a global
variable, <b  >$MAX_QUESTIONS</b>, at the top of the
program. Either very short or very long quizzes can be allowed for
by changing this variable.</p><p>Also, notice how we manage to create a page of HTML that
invokes our program with an argument in the query string. We use
the &lt;ISINDEX&gt; tag, which has been all but forgotten on the
Web, mostly because it creates an ugly text box whose instructions
are difficult or impossible to change and rarely relevant to the
subject at hand. Nevertheless, &lt;ISINDEX&gt; comes in handy if
you want to provide a program with a mechanism to feed a
user-defined argument to itself.</p><p>In addition, we create a new instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> based on the name of the quiz that
we received from the user in the query string. Once the instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b> is created, we instruct it to load
its contents from disk. Of course, if this is a new quiz, then
there is nothing to load, and this is noted in the error message
returned by the <b  >loadFile</b> method. We don't care
if there was an error opening the file&mdash;if the quiz file exists,
the contents are displayed in the HTML form, but if it does not
exist, it is treated as a new quiz.</p><p>Of course, it is not a good idea to ignore error messages
altogether. But the error messages returned by the
<b  >loadFile</b> method are fairly primitive, indicating
whether the file was successfully loaded. Better error messages
might distinguish between an inability to find the file in
question, a quiz file that exists but cannot be read and a quiz
file containing errors. But for now, this is all we've got, so we
will have to live with it.</p><p>We insert the current value of each HTML form element by
placing the value inside a variable. One of the nice things about
Perl is that uninitialized variables default to the empty string
(<b  >""</b>). This means that if we have not set a
particular question or answer, things don't crash. Rather, since we
get the empty string back from the variable, we can stick the
variable into the form element's <b  >value</b>
attribute, thus resetting the form element's value.</p><p>We use a bit of cleverness to indicate which element of the
selection list (which is used to indicate the correct answer)
should be selected by default. Here is the code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $letter = "";
foreach $letter
("a","b","c","d")
{
   print "&lt;option ";
   print "selected " if ($letter eq $correct);
   print "$letter&gt;$letter\n";
}
print "&lt;/select&gt;\n";
</pre><p>In this code, we simply iterate through all four possible
correct answers, inserting the word <b  >selected</b>
inside of the <b  >&lt;option&gt;</b> tag where it is
appropriate.
</p><p>As you can see, it is not difficult to create a program that
displays the contents of a quiz file. If we want to create an
editor, we need to write the second half of the program, namely the
part that takes the submitted form contents and saves them to disk.
Luckily, the way we have organized our HTML form makes this fairly
trouble-free.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc2c580.0xd1c968"></a>Editing the Quiz</h2></div></div><p>The part of edit-quiz.pl that handles saving information is
invoked via <b  >POST</b>, when the user clicks on the
<b  >submit</b> button at the bottom of the page. At this
point, the HTML form elements are sent to
<b  >edit-quiz.pl</b> and made available using the
<b  >param</b> method from CGI.pm.</p><p>So when edit-quiz.pl is invoked using
<b  >POST</b>, we simply need to do the following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>create a new instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b></p></li><li><p>iterate through all of the HTML form elements
submitted</p></li><li><p>turn these form elements into new questions</p></li><li><p>save <b  >QuizQuestions</b></p></li></ol></div><p>The simplest way to do this is to loop through all of the
possible elements. We know how many elements might exist, thanks to
the <b  >$MAX_QUESTIONS</b> global variable. Thus, we can
do something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $counter = 0;
foreach $counter (0 .. $MAX_QUESTIONS)
{
   # Add question number $counter
}
</pre><p>Adding a new question is now accomplished by using the
<b  >addQuestion</b> method from within
<b  >QuizQuestions</b>. Once we create an instance of
<b  >QuizQuestions</b>, we can add a new question by
invoking the method, and passing it the question text, the possible
answers, and the correct answer as arguments. Given the names of
our HTML form elements are regular, we can expand the above loop
as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Create an instance of QuizQuestions
my $questions = new QuizQuestions($quizname);
# Add questions to $questions
my $counter = 0;
foreach $counter (1 .. $MAX_QUESTIONS)
{
   # Only handle as many questions as were filled
   # in, by
   # checking to see if the question was entered
   last unless ($query-&gt;param("question-$counter")
         ne "$counter");
   # Set the question
   my @question =
                ($query-&gt;param("question-$counter"),
                $query-&gt;param("answer-a-$counter"),
                $query-&gt;param("answer-b-$counter"),
                $query-&gt;param("answer-c-$counter"),
                $query-&gt;param("answer-d-$counter"),
                $query-&gt;param("correct-$counter"));
   # Add the question to the quiz
   $questions-&gt;addQuestion(@question);
}
</pre>


The above loop should look familiar if you looked through last
month's column. That's because the loop is lifted from
<b  >create-quiz.pl</b>, I have changed a variable name
and modified the condition on the &ldquo;last&rdquo; statement. This ensures
that the loop will exit if the text of the quiz question is the
same as the quiz number, since each quiz question is set to its
number in our editor.
</p><p>Now that you have seen how the heart of edit-quiz.pl works,
take a look at the entire program in
<a href="2319l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. As you can see, it did
not take many modifications to make this program work. That's
because the bulk of the work is done by objects already created.
CGI.pm takes care of reading the HTML form elements and handing
them to us in a nicely packaged format, while QuizQuestions.pm
takes care of loading and saving the questions from the quiz file.
Now we don't have to get our hands dirty. (And neither do our
users, who can now create quizzes without having to worry about
formatting issues.)</p><p>I have also done a bit of reshuffling with the original
segments of <b  >edit-quiz.pl</b>, such that we always
see the results of our editing work and can make additional changes
to the quiz. This is somewhat better than the standard Web
interface, in which saving also means quitting. Here, there isn't
any real <b  >exit</b> button, since saving brings you
back to where you were.</p><p>There are a few minor problems with the current versions of
these programs. In particular, it is potentially dangerous for a
user to enter a pair of quotation marks (<b  >""</b>)
inside one of the text fields. A browser might have difficulties
determining which quotation marks belong to the string and which
set the string's boundaries. (However, Netscape 3.0 on my Linux box
appears to handle this just fine, much to my surprise.)</p><p>Although we forget it most of the time, we continue to be
haunted by our old friend the tab character, which still separates
the fields in our quiz file. If a user were to enter a tab into one
of the text fields in our quiz editor, the quiz file's format would
be damaged and would cause problems. A solution to this would
involve iterating through each of the HTML form elements handed to
us by CGI.pm and removing any tabs. Better yet, we could replace
them with spaces.</p><p><a href="2319s1.html" target="_self">Notes</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc2c580.0xd1d6d0"></a>Next Month</h2></div></div><p>Next month, we will look at hybrid templates that you can
create with HTML and Perl, thanks to the magic of the
Text::Template module. By embedding programs inside of HTML files,
we can include both static HTML and programming elements. This can
be a great advantage when you want to produce output using a
program, but don't want to lock the HTML styling inside of a
program, since your site's editors and designers will eventually
want to change the content and style of the program's
output.</p></div></div>
