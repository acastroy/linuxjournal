    A quick look at a language designed to manipulate matrices
    and provide other numerical functions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2890580.0x2988500"></a></h2></div></div><p>For numerical computing, high level
languages offer advantages over more traditional languages, such as
FORTRAN or C. Built-in graphics capabilities, automatic variable
typing and flexible data structures combine to provide an
environment in which it is easy to develop your ideas without
having to fight with the language. That's not to say that FORTRAN
and C are of no use, just that sometimes you want to make life a
bit easier.
</p><p>Matlab is a one such language. It is available on many
platforms (including Linux) and provides powerful facilities for
manipulating matrices, as well as other numerical functions.
Unfortunately, Matlab is commercial software and wasn't available
for Linux until recently (in the last twelve months or so).
However, there are other, freely-available alternatives, and Octave
is one such alternative.</p><p>Superficially, Octave looks very much like Matlab, and the
description in its LSM entry reads &ldquo;GNU Matlab&mdash;A numerical matrix
mathematics program.&rdquo; To begin, type <b  >octave</b> at
the shell prompt, and Octave greets you with its own prompt. Now we
can start doing math.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2890580.0x2988710"></a>Matrix Operations</h2></div></div><p>As you might expect, entering and manipulating matrices is
one of Octave's strengths. (In order to differentiate Octave
commands from the output, the prompt
<b  >octave:<i><tt>number of the
command</tt></i></b> precedes the commands in the
examples below.) We can enter a matrix with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
octave:1 a=[1 2 ; 3 4]
</pre><p>Octave then reports the result of the command, namely:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a =
        1  2
        3  4
</pre>


To suppress output, simply place a semicolon after the command.
Note that we didn't have to worry about declaring the size or type
of the matrix <b  >a</b>, we just type it in and start
working with it. For example, we can get the transpose of
<b  >a</b> by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:2 a'
      ans =
        1  3
        2  4
</pre>


Arithmetic operators such as <b  >+</b>,
<b  >-</b> and <b  >*</b> act as matrix
operators unless they are preceded by a period, in which case they
act in an element by element sense. Octave also provides the
forward and backward slash operators that perform matrix right and
left division. Again, these can be used in an element-wise fashion.
So, given another matrix:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:3 b=[1 0; 3 2]
b =
  1  0
  3  2
</pre>


we can find the matrix product of <b  >a</b> and
<b  >b</b> with the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:4 a*b
ans =
   7   4
  15   8
</pre>


Or define the (<b  >i,j</b>)th entry of the product is
the product of the (<b  >i,j</b>) entries in
<b  >a</b> and <b  >b</b> with the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:5 a.*b
ans =
  1  0
  9  8
</pre>


Matrix elements can easily be selected by index, so to get the
(1,1) entry of <b  >a</b>, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:6 a(1,1)
ans=1
</pre>


We can select a row or column using the colon operator, exactly as
in Matlab. Thus, to select the first column of <b  >a</b>
type the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:7 a(:,1)
ans =
  1
  3
</pre>


And to select the first row of <b  >a</b> type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:8 a(1,:)
ans =
  1  2
</pre>


As well as these elementary operations, Octave provides functions
that perform higher-level operations, such as finding the
eigenvalues of a matrix, by using a command like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:9 eig(a)
ans =
   5.37228
  -0.37228
</pre>


Alternatively, you can find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors by
giving the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:10 [v,d]=eig(a)
v =
   0.41597  -0.82456
   0.90938   0.56577
d =
   5.37228   0.00000
   0.00000  -0.37228
</pre>


This is a demonstration of one of the main advantages of using a
high level language like Octave. Writing a FORTRAN or C program to
find the eigenvalues of a matrix would take a lot more time and
effort than it does in Octave. Moreover, Octave routines are
usually based on well-known, high quality algorithms, so you can
have faith in the results.
</p><p>Octave provides many other matrix routines, which are
detailed in the manual and in the on-line help system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2890580.0x2989210"></a>User-Defined Functions</h2></div></div><p>Octave also lets the user define his own functions via the
<b  >function</b> keyword. A function definition looks
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
function [output values] = name (input values)
   sequence of commands
endfunction
</pre><p>The input and output values are optional, so it is possible
to write a function that takes no arguments and returns no values,
such as
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:11 function hello
   printf("hello\n")
endfunction
</pre>


The <b  >printf</b> statement prints the quoted string to
the screen, and the \n is interpreted as a newline. Invoke the
function by typing its name:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:12 hello
   hello
</pre>


Obviously, functions that don't take arguments or return values
aren't all that useful. To accept arguments, list them after the
function name in the following manner:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:13 function add(x,y)
   x+y
endfunction
octave:14 add(1,2)
   ans = 3
</pre>


The output came from the statement <b  >x+y</b>--if we
had ended the line with a semicolon, there wouldn't have been any
output from the <b  >add</b> command. To assign the
output to a variable, define the function in this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:15 function sum=add(x,y)
   sum=x+y;
endfunction
</pre>


Now, if we type <b  >add(1,2)</b>, we get exactly the
same result as before. However, by defining an output variable, we
can assign the result of the <b  >add</b> function to a
variable in this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:16 fred=add(1,2)
   fred=3
</pre>


A very powerful feature of Octave is the ability to return multiple
values from a function. This feature exists in Matlab, but not in
FORTRAN. For example, the following function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:17 function [sum,diff]=sumdiff(x,y)
   sum=x+y;
   diff=x-y;
endfunction
</pre>


returns multiple values when invoked as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:18 ns,d]=sumdiff(1,2)
   s = 3
   d = -1
</pre>


Functions can be defined at the keyboard, as we did in these
examples, or stored in a file and used again. This lets you build a
suite of routines for whatever tasks you want. All you have to do
is put the files (identified with a <b  >.m</b> suffix)
somewhere where Octave can find them. The built-in variable
<b  >LOADPATH</b> specifies where Octave should look for
the <b  >.m</b> files. Many of Octave's standard
functions are defined in <b  >.m</b> files. You can also
access user-supplied C++ routines within Octave, although this
feature is not yet fully developed.
</p><p>Octave also provides a full programming language, with flow
control and looping constructs, as well as extensive input-output
facilities. It is possible to write quite sophisticated programs in
Octave, and development time is considerably shorter than you would
expect using FORTRAN or C.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2890580.0x29899f8"></a>Other Capabilities</h2></div></div><p>Although Octave has very strong matrix capabilities, it has
many other features as well. For example, it has routines to
manipulate polynomials. A polynomial is entered as a vector of
coefficients; so, for example, the polynomial x3+3x2+2x-1 can be
represented by the vector:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
octave:19 mypoly=[1 3 2 -1]
   mypoly =
     1   3   2  -1
</pre><p>We can then differentiate <b  >mypoly</b> using the
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:20 polyderiv(mypoly)
   ans =
     3  6  2
</pre>


or integrate it by:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:21 polyinteg(mypoly)
  ans =
  0.25000   1.00000   1.00000  -1.00000   0.00000
</pre>


Note that Octave uses zero as the constant of integration. We can
also evaluate the polynomial at a given value; thus, to find the
value of <b  >mypoly(2)</b> use the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:22 polyval(mypoly,2)
   ans = 23
</pre>


If we want the roots of the polynomial, use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
octave:23 roots(mypoly)
   ans =
     -1.66236 + 0.56228i
     -1.66236 - 0.56228i
      0.32472 + 0.00000i
</pre>


Note that Octave is quite happy with complex numbers, even though
all the examples I've given have been real. There are also routines
to convolve and deconvolve polynomials, form companion matrices and
characteristic polynomials, and form a partial fraction
representation of the quotient of two matrices.
</p><p>Other features include functions to solve systems of
nonlinear equations, solve differential and differential-algebraic
equations, perform quadrature and collocation, as well as
statistics, control theory, signal processing, image processing and
optimization routines. The manual indicates areas where the
developers hope to extend Octave's capabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2890580.0x29806a8"></a>Graphics</h2></div></div><p>Octave provides graphics capabilities via the Gnuplot
program, which has to be obtained separately. The advantage of this
is that Octave supports all the output devices Gnuplot supports,
including the Linux terminal, which might be of interest if you
have a low-memory system.</p><p>Octave provides two low-level graphics functions,
<b  >gplot</b> and <b  >gsplot</b>, that behave
almost exactly like the Gnuplot functions <b  >plot</b>
and <b  >splot</b>, and also provides several
higher-level plotting functions based on the graphics functions
found in Matlab 3.5. Two and three-dimensional plotting commands
are also available.</p><p>If you are familiar with Gnuplot, then you will probably
appreciate the flexibility offered by access to Gnuplot's commands.
However, the higher-level commands offered by Octave are very easy
to use and you may find you don't have to use the Gnuplot commands
at all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2890580.0x29809c0"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Octave is a flexible, powerful, easy-to-use, high-level
language designed for numerical computations. It comes with a very
readable 200+ page user manual, and a help system based around the
GNU info system. The main advantage of a high-level language over a
language like FORTRAN is that development time is usually
considerably shorter using a high-level language. This allows for
easy prototyping and experimentation.</p><p>Although the documentation doesn't claim that Octave is
intended to be a Matlab clone, or Matlab compatible, Octave is
probably the most Matlab-like of the freely available high level
languages. It's not exactly the same, but I was able to convert a
suite of Matlab m-files that perform finite element analysis of the
Navier-Stokes equations to Octave very easily.</p><p>Octave has many more features than I have described here, but
I've provided an overview of its main strengths. If you're looking
for a language for numerical work, Octave is certainly an option. I
don't think you can directly compare Octave with such languages as
RLaB, SciLab and Yorick&mdash;they all do different things, and which
you choose depends on what you want to do as well as personal
preference. My preference is Octave.</p></div></div>
