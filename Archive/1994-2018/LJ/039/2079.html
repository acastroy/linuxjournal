process. If I can install the package without reading the
documentation, that is a good thing. If I can use the software
within minutes after setting up, I consider that another good
quality. Finally, if I can use the application without reading the
documentation, I consider it a truly intuitive application.</p><p>Microstation 95 met or exceeded most of my expectations in
each of these three areas.</p><p>As a consultant, I get numerous opportunities to fix things,

Microstation survived the &ldquo;Can I Break It&rdquo; test and gets four and
a half stars for its performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4b978"></a>Description</h2></div></div><p>Microstation 95 is a commercial-grade CAD application for
architectural, engineering, construction, geographic information
systems and mechanical design professionals. Microstation 95
provides the 2D and 3D environment tools necessary to design and
add detail to a drawing quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, it
provides network connectivity for work group environments and a
database server with connectivity to numerous Unix- and DOS-based
database applications.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2079f3.jpg"></div><p>Microstation 95 looks and acts like a typical Microsoft
compatible product, with familiar drop-down menus, button pop-up
tips and hypertext help. It offers the option of a Windows or
Motif-style interface. The Windows option is true to form, even to
the extent of using the same names and parameters found in the
Windows Control Panel &ldquo;Colors&rdquo; option.</p><p>I chose the Motif configuration, because it is more flexible
than the Windows option. There are no discernible performance or
feature penalties for using either interface. Active windows are
handled in the same manner as in MS Windows with one notable
exception: if one window is too large, it will not arrange the
windows to fit the screen, prompting the user to adjust the window
size instead.</p><p>The toolbox buttons display tool tips, which are helpful
because not all of the button graphics are clear as to their
function.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4bc90"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Immediately after receiving the Microstation 95 review kit, I
loaded the CD and installed the software. Upon executing
<b  >setup.exe</b>, I encountered an error that had to be
resolved before I could continue. Adding a symlink to
<b  >libncurses.so.1.9.9e</b> fixed the problem, and the
installation resumed. The installation prompted me with the
customary questions: &ldquo;Where do you want it?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How much do
you want to install?&rdquo;</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2079f4.jpg"></div><p>The user preferences and system configuration are taken care
of from within the running application. Overall, the installation
is fast, easy and straightforward. The process takes about 30
minutes to complete and the package uses a miserly 50MB of the hard
drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4bfa8"></a>Tech Support</h2></div></div><p>The only documentation provided with the evaluation copy is
in the form of the help files and a Microsoft Windows-based sampler
CD. This did not present any major problems, because the interface
is generally easy to understand. I did call the company's toll-free
number to inquire about tech support, only to find that a call to
the tech support people would cost me a long-distance call&mdash;not
what I wanted to hear.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c0b0"></a>Comparison with Other Products</h2></div></div><p>To compare an application like Microstation 95 to mainframe
CATIA may seem unfair at first, but in reality, I find Microstation
95 to be more flexible and more agile in its execution. In the
short time I had to review Microstation 95, I was impressed with
its capabilities, speed and efficiency in comparison to its
mainframe cousin.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2079f8.jpg"></div><p>I chose to use the tutorials to both learn the system and to
judge its suitability for the task. I found the examples to be very
informative and a great way to push the test envelope. I learned
quickly to turn off the automatic save on exit feature, so I could
return to the example later and try new torture methods on
it.</p><p>The true test came when I began rendering the examples. At
each level of display, the load requirements increased and the
display performance declined. What surprised me was Microstation
95's speed. I am accustomed to waiting several minutes for a simple
shading operation in CATIA. I was not expecting to see a complex
model rendered in less time, but that's what happened..</p><p>The AccuDraw and SmartLine features enhance productivity by
producing intelligent elements that are easily placed and modified.
Bi-directional associative dimensioning makes detailing fast and
easy. CATIA offers similar functions, but Microstation makes them
more readily available to the user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c3c8"></a>Company Profile</h2></div></div><p>Bentley Systems, Inc. was founded in 1984 by Keith and Barry
Bentley. It is a privately held corporation with over 400 employees

Microstation 95 in over 15,000 companies and organizations around
the world. They include Boeing, AT&amp;T, American Airlines,
Westinghouse Electric Corporation, U.S. Department of Commerce,
Union Carbide C &amp; P Company plus numerous other commercial
users and government agencies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a53580.0x1b4c5d8"></a>Platforms</h2></div></div><p>The review was performed on an AMD 5x86-P75 133MHz machine
with 20MB RAM, running Linux 2.0.0. Display was handled by a Number
9 Vision 330 1MB video card.</p><p>Bentley Systems, Inc. also offers Microstation 95 for DOS,
Windows 3.1x, Windows 95, Windows NT, OS/2 Warp and PowerPC or Dec
Alpha AXP PCs running Windows NT. Microstation 95 will run on 80386
(with a math coprocessor), 80486, Pentium, DEC Alpha and PowerPC
processors, with a minimum of 8MB RAM for the DOS package and 24MB
minimum RAM for DEC Alpha or PowerPC.</p><p><a href="2079s1.html" target="_self">More Figures</a></p></div></div>
