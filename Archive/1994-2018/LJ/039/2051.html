    Using UUDeview can relieve you of the problems associated with
    sending and receiving binary e-mail.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f3580.0x26eb4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When did you last send or receive an
e-mail? Right. The WWW is fun to surf, but the true killer
application on the Internet is e-mail. Another similarly popular
service is the Usenet, where you can directly address a desired
target audience. There is no doubt that these two services are the
most personal.
</p><p>Suppose you want to smile at your pals? Or that you're red
with anger? We all know the &ldquo;emot-icons&rdquo; to use here. However,
you will see no emot-icons on the Web; instead you will see icon
smilies or maybe even a photograph of a smile. These same symbols
would be more effective in e-mail than emot-icons, and a
threatening roll of thunder could really frighten your reader.
&ldquo;Now, that's impossible,&rdquo; you'll say&mdash;and you're almost right.
But why?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f3580.0x26eb608"></a>A Bit of History</h2></div></div><p>E-mail service was conceived in the infant days of the
Internet, and the Usenet actually started as an off-line network,
where messages were distributed via slow modem lines. At that time,
transferring large amounts of data like graphics or audio messages
was inconceivable, and both systems were designed to handle only
plain text messages.</p><p>When the available bandwidth increased, people realized that
exchange of binary data instead of just ASCII messages should be
possible. Now the design limitations became obvious. But instead of
going back to the drawing board with their systems, an algorithm
was introduced to <span   class="emphasis"><em>encode</em></span> binary data into
plain-text messages, thus bypassing the
problem&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>uuencoding</em></span> was born. Using this
algorithm, three arbitrary bytes were encoded in four printable
characters which could then be safely transported with the old
software. On the other end, the recipient could decode the data
back into its original form.</p><p>Unfortunately, the original uuencoding algorithm wasn't
perfect, and several other encodings were launched. First
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxencoding</em></span>, then a slightly revised
uuencoding, the BinHex encoding, which also took care of both the
special characteristics of Macintosh files and the slightly
better-compressing <span   class="emphasis"><em>ship</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>btoa</em></span> encodings. The chaos was complete&mdash;you
needed different tools for each of them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f3580.0x26eb978"></a>MIME is Introduced</h2></div></div><p>Finally, MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) came
into being. This standard enabled the effortless transportation of
binary data by introducing Base64, another encoding algorithm. It
also addressed other issues such as content presentation and the
required localized character set for international messages. With
MIME encapsulation, a combination of text, audio and video can be
sent in a single message along with instructions (for example,
whether the audio is to be played along with the video or
afterwards). Using these capabilities, you can add graphic icons to
your text and underline the message with deafening thunder. You can
also send your message as HTML with links to your home page, or as
a fully formatted PostScript document. MIME can significantly
update the look of e-mail and the Usenet, making the Internet a
happier place.</p><p>But life just isn't that simple. Although the MIME standard
was first published in 1992, it hasn't been widely accepted despite
its many advantages. Some small improvements have made the jump
into real life (such as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Content-Type</em></span>
header), but the full capabilities have yet to be exploited. Still,
most binary data posted on the Usenet is encoded using uuencoding,
and some Windows-based email software uses BinHex encoding by
default. If you are still using the mail and Usenet software that
has served you so well over the years, you are probably stuck with
decoding the Base64 data used in MIME messages as well.</p><p>Until all users have switched to MIME-compliant software, you
must save the messages from your mail or Usenet reader into a file
and dissect that file with various tools in order to extract the
images and audio clips. And even then it is amazing how much can go
wrong.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f3580.0x26ebb88"></a>Enter UUDeview</h2></div></div><p>After being disappointed by many similar tools, I developed
my own &ldquo;Smart Decoder&rdquo; to address the various problems I
encounter when receiving an encoded file.</p><p>The resultant decoder is a tool called UUDeview. Despite its
early development stage&mdash;its version number is 0.5&mdash;it does its job
well. It can read plain encoded data and whole message folders,
which are automatically sorted, grouped and threaded in case any
data is spread over more than one message (the dreaded multi-part
messages). The user can instruct the program to decode each file or
not. UUDeview also handles uuencoding, MIME's Base64 and
BinHex.</p><p>The UUDeview package comes complete with UUEnview. UUEnview
has a big advantage over the standard uuencode in that it can
directly mail or post files from the command line, either uuencoded
or as proper MIME messages.</p><p>Both tools can be installed to replace the standard programs
uuencode and uudecode, mimicking their command-line syntax, while
adding full power to both the encoding and, in particular, the
decoding process.</p><p>For users who prefer the mouse over the keyboard, a
Tcl/Tk-based interface is also included. Alas, I can usually finish
decoding from the command line more quickly than the GUI can start
up.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2051f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Screen Shot of UUDeview Interface
</p></div></div><p>Since development was done on a Linux box and other Unices,
the code is highly portable. In the latest release, the programs
are built around an encoding and decoding library. Using this
library, a programmer can not only easily write different user
interfaces (an example of a trivial decoder is 37 source lines in
C), but also can use the decoding power of the library in other
applications with a small amount of effort. From the web page (see
below), you can currently download patches to the
<span   class="bold"><b>elm</b></span> mail software and the
<span   class="bold"><b>nn</b></span> news reader. After integrating
the patches, you can tag the mail and articles as usual, then
decode any binaries with the touch of a button.</p><p>Once the whole world has switched to MIME, UUDeview can
finally &ldquo;Rest In Peace&rdquo;, but until then, it can save you some
frustration when trying to read binary mail and news articles.
