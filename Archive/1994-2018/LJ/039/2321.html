I see an article written by me with the subtitle: &ldquo;Assembly
language is a wonderful tool for teaching about how computers work.
Professor Sevenich explains how it is used at WSU.&rdquo; I am at EWU,

April 1997, page 53) is very interesting. I understand you are
having problems with the current version of XFree86 with the Matrox
Millenium Board. Here's a possible solution:</p><p>The XFree86 Organization has recently released the new 3.2
version of XFree86, which is also known as X11R6.1. It now supports
about 320 different cards, including the Matrox Millenium, and
several Chips and Technologies chip sets commonly used in notebook
computers. The site to download the new version of the XFree86 is:
ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/packages/XFree86/3.2/binaries/Linux/ix86-Elf/</p><p>The web site for further information is:

University. I work in a Geographic Information Systems Laboratory
(GIS), and we have been using just AIX machines. However, we do
have a full-blown Linux PC, and it is great. We were considering
upgrading to all Linux PCs in our lab, because they were cheaper
and faster than the AIX boxes, but we ran into a problem&mdash;the
software we need to run to make our GIS maps is not supported by
ESRI. We gave them a call, and they told us: &ldquo;Linux will not be a
supported platform. Product ports are user-driven and there are not
enough users wanting this OS&rdquo;. How could this could be true when
all you have to do is get on the web to see that millions of people
are using Linux? So I need Linux users to e-mail ESRI at
buspartners@esri.com and tell them you use Linux and there are many
more people using Linux too. ESRI needs to get its head out of
Microsoft's world and see what is going on in the real world. &mdash;Tred

the Perfect Box: How to Design Your Linux Workstation&rdquo; (Issue #
36, April 1997, page 16), and it was a good read. But... Under the
section entitled &ldquo;Some pitfalls to avoid&rdquo;, Eric says don't buy
PnP cards&mdash;Linux doesn't support them. I would suggest this is
rather a bleak way to look at it and that the situation is not that
bad. Check out isapnptools on
http://www.roestock.demon.co.uk/isapnptools/ for some software I
wrote to configure PnP devices. This brings PnP hardware to the
same state as configuring jumpers, i.e., you still need a
driver.</p><p>Currently, I have a PnP internal modem and network card
running quite happily using isapnptools to configure them on
boot.</p><p>Debian appears to have picked this up as
well. &mdash;Peter isapnp@roestock.demon.co.uk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5d6b8"></a>Distributions Question</h2></div></div><p>I read the descriptions of the various distributions of Linux
in your 1997 Buyer's Guide. I currently use Slackware and was
considering a new distribution, possibly Debian. In the review
starting on page 128, Phil Hughes states &ldquo;... as far as I know, no
commercial software packages are available in the Debian format.&rdquo;
I am confused. What difference does the format really make? If
company X supports kernel Y and the distribution supports kernel Y,
shouldn't the product of company X run on that distribution?</p><p>I understand that the installation may not be as pretty as if
it were written for a package system supported for the
distribution. The software, however, should work with the kernel,
i.e., if WordPerfect exists for Linux kernel ver. 2.0.0 on, say,
Red Hat, should not WordPerfect work for any distribution using
kernel version 2.0.0 or am I missing something? &mdash;Thomas L.
Gossard tgossard@ix.netcom.com</p><p>There are two considerations: loading the package and
licensing. If the package comes in a format easily unpacked on any
system (such as the gzipped tar format used by Slackware),
unpacking is not a problem. You may, however, need to deal with
versions and locations of libraries and other files to get it
running.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If the software is packaged in Red Hat's .rpm
format, you need a utility to unpack it. Debian, for example,
includes such a package. Here at</em></span> <i  >LJ</i>, we are in the
process of converting our systems from Slackware to Debian. As part
of this conversion, we are adding office suite software for some of
our users. We installed a copy of Applixware on a Debian system
with no problems. (And Erik Troan of Red Hat informs us that
Applixware will run on other distributions as well.)</p><p>You mentioned WordPerfect, which leads us to the licensing
issue. Caldera has a licensing agreement with Corel Corp., makers
of WordPerfect, which states that you can run the Linux version of
WordPerfect only under Caldera's flavor of Linux. My understanding
is that the other applications Caldera has facilitated porting to
Linux are not licensed this way&mdash;you are free to run them with any
flavor of Linux. &mdash;Phil Hughes info@linuxjournal.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5d9d0"></a>Pure Java</h2></div></div><p>I read your article about The Linux Appliance (&ldquo;From the
Publisher&rdquo;, Issue #36, April 1997, page 12) with interest. Right
offhand, I can't help but ask myself:</p><p>How can such an appliance compete with a &ldquo;pure Java&rdquo; system
as an appliance? What kind of marketing technique might be used to
offset the power of Microsoft? How might we get some major hardware
makers (like Sony, Panasonic, etc.) interested?</p><p>Is there anything I can do, or anyone I might contact, to
help this along (purely on a part-time basis; I have a full-time
job as a mainframe/NT system support analyst; if it became a
money-maker, I could quit, of course)?</p><p>I don't have any business or manufacturing experience, but I
have wanted to contribute something good to Linux for a long time.
This might be a possibility. &mdash;Chuck</p><p>I'm not the person ready to manufacture and market this
appliance so I am hoping someone else will seriously address these
points, but here is my input.</p><p>A pure Java system might be a winner, but it could also be a
dead end. An addition to Java or a move to something other than
Java would result in an obsolete system. On the other hand, a
programmable computer makes it easy to follow software changes. In
addition, upgrading from an Internet Appliance to a useful computer
for word processing and such is also possible.</p><p>As for the power of Microsoft, the sales approach is what
could make the difference. Anyone can buy a PC/Microsoft system
from a catalog or retail store but for many, this is a scary
proposition. While computers have come a long way toward being easy
to set up and use, offering the necessary support with a system
like this could make a big difference. Much like getting a price
break on a cellular phone when you purchase air time, ISPs could
offer a price break on these systems with connectivity contracts.
The ISP would then be there to support it.</p><p>As for the possibility of Sony or Panasonic getting
interested, if you know the right people to talk to, point them at
me. The idea of Linux on the Sony Playstation has already been
suggested. &mdash;Phil Hughes info@linuxjournal.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5dd40"></a>Applixware Review</h2></div></div><p>I appreciated your review of Applixware in the April 1997
issue of the <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I do feel
obligated to point one large error&mdash;Applix data is NOT provided
with the 4.3 release, according to Lisa Sullivan at Red Hat.</p><p>There are some people (Cameron Newham,
cameron.newham@nomura.co.uk) working on interfaces to databases
that do exist on Linux, but the full-fledged Applix Data interface
is not likely to exist in the near future, a victim of lack of
support from the big-3 database vendors&mdash;at least, that is the
reason in my opinion.</p><p>Applixware has a chance to do either a lot of good or a lot
of harm to the Linux community. It is not quite ready to replace MS
Office. Filters and data access, as well as performance with
embedded graphics, are areas that need work.</p><p>If people expect it to do everything, try it, and are
disappointed, they may end up dismissing Linux as junk&mdash;a tragic
mistake. &mdash;Cary O'Brien cobrien@access.digex.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5dfa8"></a>Many Thanks</h2></div></div><p>Dear Terry Dawson,</p><p>I just wanted to thank you for your article &ldquo;A 10-Minute
Guide for Using PPP to Connect Linux to the Internet&rdquo; that
appeared in Issue 36 of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>I bought Slackware 2.3 (kernel version 1.2.8) in September of
1995, loaded it on my Micron Pentium-90 and have been experimenting
with it ever since. Being more experienced with DOS/Windows, I
wasn't successful in getting my PPP connection to work from Linux.
I read Matt Welsh's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> and Patrick
Volkerding's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Configuration and
Installation</em></span> as well as the PPP HOWTO but had no success
until your article. Since then, I've gotten ftp, rlogin, telnet,
lynx 2.3 and Netscape Navigator 1.1 to run. Next, it's e-mail (I'm
sending you this from my DOS/Windows partition). &mdash;Steve
Tjensvoldstjen svo@execpc.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a65580.0x1b5e268"></a>Etherminals</h2></div></div><p>I read your article in this month's <i  >LJ</i>
with much interest. In the March 10th issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Computerworld</em></span> magazine, Mr. Charles Babcock
wrote about building his own network computer from scratch. From
the sound of his article, Mr. Babcock had no previous experience
with Linux, yet that was the OS he chose for his NC.</p><p>Mr. Babcock was not able to keep the price of his NC below
$500. However, it is not clear whether he used many resources
towards getting the best prices available. Clearly, anyone
venturing into this on a large scale would be able to better his
price&mdash;$1200.</p><p>What interests me most about both articles is the fact that
such a system already exists&mdash;and has existed for over a year.
IGEL, LLC has a line of systems called Etherminals&mdash;they were even
advertised in <i  >LJ</i> for a while. (That's where I
learned of them)</p><p>I left a full-time position as a Unix Systems Engineer in
August of '95 to help my wife with the acquisition of the
veterinary hospital where she had worked (as a veterinarian). One
of my first responsibilities was to install a computer
network.</p><p>That's when I discovered the Etherminals. The model 3x was
IGEL's current offering&mdash;386sx-40 w/ 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet
(all 3 media types) and the standard compliment of 2 serial and 1
parallel ports. What made these machines so attractive to me was
that they booted Linux and X Windows from ROM/NVRAM. These units
had no drives&mdash;not a floppy, not a hard drive, nothing.</p><p>I went out on a limb and bought three of them. Once they
arrived, I connected them to the Ethernet I'd run (with the help of
a couple of good friends) the week before. In a little over an hour
I had everything working like a charm. I think it helped more than
a little that the server was running Linux as well. (This was
something that I insisted on&mdash;it even became a point of contention
with two potential vendors of veterinary office
applications.)</p><p>In the end, we chose a vendor whose application was (and
still is) DOS-based. DOSEMU now runs multiple sessions on the
server and uses X to redirect the I/O to the Etherminals. It's an
acceptable solution&mdash;DOS being the weakest link.</p><p>The most important point of this whole message is that this
solution was arrived at over a year ago. No need to wait for SUN or
ORACLE. It's here today. &mdash;Chuck Stickleman stick@richnet.net</p></div></div>
