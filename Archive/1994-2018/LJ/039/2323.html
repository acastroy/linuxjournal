Multitasking
</p></div></div>
 Welcome to installment 3 of Clueless at the Prompt. Thanks for the
encouraging e-mail. In response to several requests, here is a
little information to help you get your feet wet.</p><p>If you are familiar with that other windowing system, you may
be aware of the concept of multitasking. Using a single computer to
do several applications at once is a highly desirable trait for an
operating system (OS).</p><p>It's fairly obvious how to accomplish this in a windowing
environment, but not so obvious at the shell prompt. Here are some
of the details.</p><p>When you start a program at the shell prompt, you can stop it
by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Ctrl-Z
</pre><p>which returns you to the shell prompt. Then type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bg
</pre>


and the program or job is restarted in the (b)ack(g)round. A job
can also be put in the background from the beginning by typing an
ampersand (&amp;) at the end of the command, e.g., <b  >make
filename&amp;</b>. Running your job in the background allows
you to run another job at the same time without changing to a
different virtual console (VC). The job can be brought back to the
(f)ore(g)round by typing: <b  >fg</b>, if its the only
background job, or <b  >fg
<i><tt>jobno</tt></i></b>, if there is more than
one.
</p><p>You can change to a different VC by using the Alt-F2 (through
F6) command. Each one of these can also be used in the manner that
I have described, to the extent that you can easily run out of
resources in a fit of deep-hack-mode euphoria, if you aren't
careful. If you get really exuberant, you could even forget which
jobs you have running. Relax, you can &ldquo;remember&rdquo; them by
typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
jobs
</pre><p>This command lists all jobs running in the background, much
like the <b  >ps</b> command lists all processes that are
currently using up your precious memory and CPU.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c9580.0x19c1b88"></a>Mount</h2></div></div><p>When you boot up Linux, your file system or rather your hard
drive must be mounted, so that the file system can be read and
acted on. Your floppy drive, tape backup or CD-ROM cannot be
automatically mounted, so you may need the <b  >mount</b>
utility. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt
</pre><p>or:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt
</pre>


mounts your floppy drive (called a: by DOS) to a directory called
/mnt from which you can access files on floppy disks. In the first
example, the /mnt directory can be read into the ext2 file system,
while the second reads floppies written in MS-DOS format. To read
the contents of the floppy drive, which is now /mnt you can type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt
</pre>


then, <b  >ls</b> or <b  >less
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>.
</p><p>In a similar manner, you can mount your other floppy drives,
tape drives, CD-ROMs or other read/write devices. These devices can
be unmounted using the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
umount /dev/fd0
</pre><p>or <b  >umount
/dev/<i><tt>whateveryoumounted</tt></i>&lt;\n&gt;</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18c9580.0x19c2108"></a>Some Timesavers...</h2></div></div><p>Here are a few tips that can make your Linux life a little
easier.</p><p>Suppose you make a typo in your command that you don't catch
until after you press enter. If the environment variable
<b  >FCEDIT</b> is set to <b  >emacs</b>
(default for the bash shell), you can correct it without retyping
the whole command by tapping the up arrow key to bring back the
previous command for editing with <b  >emacs</b>. In
fact, you can use the up arrow key to go up through the history
file and the down arrow to come back down if you go too far. If
<b  >FCEDIT</b> is set to <b  >vi</b> (default
for the ksh shell), press ESC (escape key) then use
<b  >k</b> to go up the history file and
<b  >j</b> to go down, and of course, use
<b  >vi</b> to edit the faulty command.</p><p>To change back to a directory you have just left or to scan
subdirectories, use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c -
</pre><p>in the following manner. Change from your /home directory to
the main trunk directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /
</pre>


then, to look at the top level of each directory, for instance,
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd usr
</pre>


then <b  >ls</b>. If you didn't find what you were
looking for, type:
</p><p><b  >cd -</b></p><p>and you will find yourself at the trunk / again.
Unfortunately, you can only go one layer deep, but it is still
useful when you install a source package and want to check out the
contents of each of the subdirectories.</p><p>Sometimes, at least at first, you may not know how to stop a
program or process that's running, but you are unwilling to let it
slowly eat up your memory or CPU overhead. To get rid of it, first
find its pid (process identification) number by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ps  -a
</pre><p>to get a list of all running processes. Make note of the pid
number and type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill
</pre>


There is another way to do this that is actually easier. Browse
through the LSM (Linux Software Map) for a utility, actually a
nicety, called die-1.1. You can unpack this utility into a
directory or use <b  >installpkg dopkg</b> or whatever
your single package installation utility is. Then look for the
/die-1.1 and <b  >cd</b> to it. This directory contains a
couple of files: a source file called die11.c and a documentation
file called die.doc.
</p><p>Assuming that you have installed the GCC compiler, just
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o die die11.c
</pre><p>hit ENTER, and presto, you've compiled the
<b  >die</b> utility. Just <b  >mv</b> it to a
directory in your path, and if you like, <b  >mv</b> the
die .doc to /usr/doc or somewhere it can be with other help text
friends (but not man pages, they'll pick on it unmercifully). Now,
next time you're in a quandary about how to gun down a process just
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
die
</pre>


and it will do the deed without having to look up the pid number.
To find out more about <b  >die</b> just type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
die
</pre>


with no argument and it will give you a summary of the commands you
can try the up arrow keys on.

the previous two, presumably since Linux is really an easy OS to
learn so my curve isn't as steep; or maybe it's the fact that I
have gone half crazy trying to install a DECvt220 to a serial port
and it refuses to cooperate.</p><p>Next Time&mdash;let me know what you would like to see in this
column, and I'll try to oblige. Just e-mail (troll@net-link.net) me
