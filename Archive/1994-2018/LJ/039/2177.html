    You can port nuclear engineering programs written in FORTRAN and C to
    Linux
    easily and efficiently.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb79580.0xc71818"></a></h2></div></div><p>The relatively exorbitant cost of
hardware and compilers necessary to put together a fully functional
engineering workstation puts them out of reach of most students or
professionals, who desire a workstation at home. Even for large
companies cutting costs without loss of efficiency is desirable.
With the advances in Intel processor speed and the ever growing
software base available for Linux, the combination presents a good
solution for the low cost workstation.
</p><p>For engineers and scientists a full featured FORTRAN 77
compiler is a must. Additionally, a readily accessible library of
numerical functions and subroutines is needed. Full featured
FORTRAN 77 compilers regardless of platform, such as Lahey's
compiler for DOS and Sun's compiler for SPARCstations, are priced
at around eight-hundred American dollars. Commercial numerical
libraries, such as IMSL, can cost thousands of dollars.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb79580.0xc71978"></a>Compiling Scientific and Engineering Code Under
Linux</h2></div></div><p>Readily available under Linux are a couple of free FORTRAN 77
options. The first is f2c, a FORTRAN to C source code converter.
The other is g77, a FORTRAN compiler produced by the GNU project.
The limitations of f2c leave g77 as the only viable alternative for
compiling large complex applications written in FORTRAN 77 under
Linux. Short pieces of FORTRAN code were written as needed for
particular engineering tasks and were compiled with g77 to test the
compiler abilities as a tool for day to day engineering activities.
It was found that g77 produced efficient binaries and behaved as a
good FORTRAN compiler should.</p><p>The next step was to compile a more significant piece of
engineering code that is commonly run on workstations in the ten to
twenty thousand dollar range. As radiation safety professionals, a
code frequently used is MCNP, that implements the &ldquo;Monte Carlo&rdquo;
method to transport neutral particle radiations. (The current
version of MCNP is 4A; 4B will be released soon.) MCNP represents
hundreds of man years of coding and is considered the best
available technology for this type of calculations. Like most
science and engineering code packages with long development
histories, MCNP is written predominantly in FORTRAN 77, and
language conversion is not considered a reasonable development
step.</p><p>One thing that makes porting this code to a new platform
somewhat challenging is that it is a safety related, pedigreed
code, so one cannot just start changing things. Any changes must be
made using patch files with the provided implementation utility.
This utility is called PRPR and is also written in FORTRAN 77. PRPR
is relatively simple code. The first step in porting MCNP to Linux
was to compile PRPR, without modification, using g77. This
operation was successful&mdash;an encouraging but misleading fact. The
rest of the package was not as cooperative.</p><p>MCNP had already been ported to numerous platforms,
everything from VMS to UNICOS. The first obvious approach was to
try the patch files provided for similar platforms. None were
successful, but these attempts did result in numerous educational
error messages.</p><p>An initial hurdle to overcome was the absence of the
<b  >fsplit</b> command in Slackware distributions. This
problem was resolved by getting <b  >fsplit</b> from a
BSD distribution.</p><p>The second hurdle was the absence of some VAX FORTRAN
extensions, specifically those related to signal handling, date and
time calls and execution timing. Although not part of the FORTRAN
77 standard, they are included with many of the commercial FORTRAN
compilers. The necessary functions of most of the VAX FORTRAN
extensions are simple enough to replicate with short C routines
that can be linked with the FORTRAN objects when the executable is
produced. The MCNP source includes a C routine to handle execution
time.</p><p>Once the VAX FORTRAN extension problems had been solved, the
remaining tens of error messages were related to problems with
integrating the FORTRAN and C objects. With MCNP plotting routines
written in ANSI C, the integration of objects is necessary to
generate a fully functional executable. The errors result from
incorrect syntax of subroutine declarations, which varies from one
FORTRAN and C compiler pair to another.</p><p>Once the executable binary had been produced
successfully&mdash;that is, a compile completed with no errors&mdash;the
provided test problems were run. Test problems are provided with
safety related codes, so that the user can verify not only that
they compiled a binary, but also that the binary produced
reasonable answers. A comparison of the test problem output from
the Linux binary to the supplied output revealed only differences
attributable to differences in architecture. The machine that
produced the standard was a SPARCstation 5, and the first Linux box
to run the MCNP binary was a 75 MHz Pentium.</p><p>Since that first platform, MCNP Version 4A has been complied
and run on 100 and 200 MHz Pentiums. While the Pentiums are not
quite as fast as a SPARCstation 20/151 (150 MHz HyperSPARC), they
are quite fast when their cost is considered relative to the
SPARCstation. Note that the referenced HyperSPARC module alone
costs over four thousand dollars.</p><p>The PRPR implemented patch files necessary to compile MCNP
Version 4A under Linux are shown in Listing 1 and 2. Note that both
the FORTRAN and the C patch are necessary. It should also be noted
that the best MCNP graphical behavior occurs when running under the
OpenLook Window manager.</p><p><a href="2177l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. FORTRAN Patch

MCNP, we do hope that this documentation of the MCNP port will be
helpful to those looking for an inexpensive workstation to run
their code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb79580.0xc72000"></a>Library of Numerical Routines for g77 Under
Linux</h2></div></div><p>A free collection of routines written in FORTRAN 77 is
SLATEC. This collection includes over 1400 mathematical and
statistical subroutines that are very well documented with comment
lines in a standard format at the head of each piece of source
code. In order for this collection to be efficiently used by a work
group sharing a workstation, it was found that the creation of a
library archive was most appropriate. The <b  >more</b>,
<b  >head</b>, and <b  >grep</b> commands with
some occasional awking have proven most adequate for finding the
subroutine desired and reviewing the documentation integrated in
the source code collection.</p><p>The SLATEC Version 4.1 library was complied and created using
g77 under Linux, and none of the sources required patching. There
is one hitch: some of the routines call user supplied subroutines,
and therefore, cannot be included in the library. These routines
are bvder, bvpor, bvsup, dbvder, dbvpor, dbvsup, dexbvp, drkfab,
exbvp and rkfab. The library was created by placing the script in
Listing 3 along with all of the <b  >.f</b> sources in
the directory /usr/local/src/slatec and executing the
script.</p><p><a href="2177l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb79580.0xc72370"></a>Shell Script to Create the SLATEC
Library</h2></div></div><p>The resulting library, libslatec.a, is placed in
/usr/local/lib and can be accessed at compile time by any user,
assuming /usr/local/lib is in their library path, with a command
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
g77 -o somefile somefile.f -lslatec
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb79580.0xc724d0"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>We have demonstrated that with a little work g77 can be used
to compile very significant FORTRAN code packages. With the
addition of two simple C routines, g77 was used to compile MCNP,
and with no source code modification at all, it compiled the vast
mathematical source collection know as SLATEC. g77 has proven to be
a FORTRAN compiler that can truly make Linux on Intel hardware, a
workstation option for the engineer and scientist, especially one
on a budget.</p><p>
