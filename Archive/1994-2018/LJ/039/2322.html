    A report from Germany on the world's largest computer fair.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf99580.0x1091348"></a></h2></div></div><p>CeBIT is the world's largest computer
fair, bringing together vendors and attendees from many different
countries. If you picture landscaped fairgrounds with 27 halls for
vendors and even more auxiliary buildings with stores and
restaurants and then add 650,000 people to the picture, all
visiting the location over seven days, you are starting to get an
image of CeBIT '97. CeBIT took place in the Messegel&auml;nde in
Hannover, Germany, March 13th to 19th, 1997.

</p><p>This was my first time attending CeBIT, and my goal was to
look at the Linux vendors and possibly talk about Linux to vendors
whose software already runs under other Unix platforms. I also
wanted to see what such a huge computer fair would be like and
contrast it to the US's largest computer fair, Comdex, in Las
Vegas, which I have attended the past seven years.</p><p>My first stop was Hall 11 to visit Caldera, Inc. Caldera's
booth was easily recognizable as a Linux booth because of &ldquo;Tux&rdquo;
the penguin, (well, a stuffed rendition of Tux) sitting on top of
one of the monitors. Caldera's booth was crowded with people every
time I visited it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2322f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A crowd in Caldera's booth
</p></div></div><p>Attendees were interested in Caldera's OpenLinux products and
getting information about Linux and Linux products. The 1500
<span   class="emphasis"><em><i>Linux Journal</i> Buyer's Guides</em></span> given away by
Caldera and their affiliated booths during CeBIT, also seemed to be
a hit with attendees. Caldera also provided information about
OpenDOS 7.01, which is free for non-commercial and educational use.
Caldera's booth staff talked about recent announcements such as the
upcoming port of Netscape software to OpenLinux, and the port of
StarOffice 3.1 to OpenLinux.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2322f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Jurgend Plate getting ready for Bayerischer Rundfunk's
cameras
</p></div></div><p>A German television station, Bayerischer Rundfunk, filmed a
short TV show about Linux at the Caldera booth. The &ldquo;TV host&rdquo;
Jurgend Plate warmed up for a few minutes while the film crew
continued to set up equipment. Before they started filming, after I
identified myself as the Associate Publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
Jurgend hollered to me that <i  >LJ</i> was &ldquo;das beste Magazin auf der
Welt!&rdquo; I was told by Sebastian Hetze of LunetIX, that Jurgend
Plate had been excited about Linux for years and that his
exuberance over Linux was real.</p><p>A second Linux stop for me was at the large StarOffice booth
in Hall 2 demonstrated on of the company's many different ports,
StarOffice on OpenLinux.</p><p>At the the third Linux stop, the large Software AG booth,
there was a signpost saying Datenbanktechnologie and the second
sign down said &ldquo;ADABAS &amp; LINUX&rdquo;. Tux sat proudly on top of
the workstation here by the Caldera OpenLinux Base. Nathan Guinn
gave me a free review copy of the single-user version of LunetIX's
ADABAS, an SQL Database, which I passed along to the Editor of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2322f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

booth
</p></div></div><p>A fourth company with a Linux product was NAG Ltd, which,
among its other products, provided information on their Linux
FORTRAN 90 Compiler.</p><p>Other companies, such as LST Software, GmBH and LunetIX had
representatives at the show, mostly working out of Caldera's
booth.</p><p>There was some press coverage about Linux. In the special
CeBIT section of the Newspaper called &ldquo;COMPUTER &amp;
KOMMUNIKATION&rdquo; there was a full-page article titled &ldquo;Linux
schultert Microsoft-Anwendungen&rdquo; which covered the capability of
Microsoft Applications to run under Linux using Caldera's Wabi
software.</p><p>All in all, CeBIT was an informative, busy, intensive, show.
Next time I should like to try it without crutches resulting from a
sprained ankle. I should also mention the color shows and
performances in some booths, including a musical story (D2-Musical)
with &ldquo;Princess Digital, the Queen of the World&rdquo;, the artistic
acrobats at VIAG Interkom and many cabaret-style performances,
which added fun, colorful and entertaining diversions to
CeBIT.</p></div></div>
