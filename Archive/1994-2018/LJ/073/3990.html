programming month! Actually, every month is programming month.
Apparently we can't call it coding, since we're using C rather than
assembly code&mdash;which is too bad, since &ldquo;coder&rdquo; sounds much more
sinister and intelligent than &ldquo;programmer&rdquo;. Regardless, lately
I've been wondering, am I the only Linux user in the world who
didn't come from a UNIX background? The truth is, all this
networking bother strikes me as a bit dull. What about normal
coding? If Linux is going to sit anywhere other than on servers,
it's going to have to be a multimedia OS. You may have noticed all
of our Stupid Programming Tricks episodes deal with multimedia.
Well, there's a method to my general idiocy. Already we can write
scrolltexts, slide graphics over backgrounds, play music,
synthesize sounds, fork processes and placate
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>. We can also log in as root
and ruin our console screens, but that's beside the point.</p><p>This month, in honor of programming, we're going to make
something neat. Yes, it's time to do something really cool and yet
somehow worthy of the title &ldquo;Stupid Programming Tricks&rdquo;. To
justify such, we must be explicit in doing something with no
practical value. Hence, the point. What better way to say &ldquo;Hello
world!&rdquo; than with a scrolltext? Hark, someone is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>senile</em></span>&mdash;we have already
<span   class="emphasis"><em>done</em></span> scrolltexts. Grrrr. How about a
scrolltext that warps like a slithering snake?</p><p>Sine scrollers are an epitomal form of the scrolltext, not
quite the pinnacle&mdash;for that, we'd need text that wraps in three
dimensions, casting shadows and twisting like threads of
deoxyribonucleic data&mdash;but an epitomal form, nonetheless. We're
also going to cheat. Well, not really, but instead of doing clever
programming tricks to save processor resources, we'll use a simple
routine, since with SVGALib, it's the only thing we can do. Sine
scrolling is a trick in itself, and I haven't found any tricks to
make it less processor-intensive, short of adding new functions to
SVGALib or lowering the resolution. It works on the 1MHz C64, and
it ran on my 60 MIPS box with digital music in the background, so I
reckon your 600 MIPS box won't suffer.</p><p>In order to make a sine scroller, we start with the makings
of normal scrolltext: a physical screen for the actual display, a
virtual screen for drawing and a scroll board to hold a graphic of
our scrolltext. In our last scrolltext episode, we just copied the
scroll board to the virtual screen and the virtual screen to the
physical screen, doing all the scrolling in the scroll board and
drawing our text as one graphic the width of the screen. This time,
every single pixel-wide vertical strip of text will have a
different Y coordinate from its neighbor when it gets drawn to the
virtual screen from the scroll board. The only way to do this is to
copy a 1x8-pixel strip, 320 times every refresh! That's about
19,200 function calls per second, even at a 60Hz refresh rate.
Well, with processors that can handle hundreds of millions of
instructions per second, it's not a big deal. My old box, which ran
at 60 bogomips before it died last summer, could do a sine scroller
with a really big 256-color font, star fields and raster bars in
640x480x256 with digital audio in the background. Remind me to dig
that code off the hard drive and cover it some time. Today, we'll
just use the standard 8x8 font in one color, to get the hang of the
whole sine-scrolling thing.</p><p>Sine functions are beautiful. You can use them for anything,
literally. A sine function has amplitude, phase, period and shift,
and you can play tricks with these. For example, you can plug a
sine equation into the amplitude, phase, period or shift on your
first sine equation. These techniques are useful not only for
making cool patterns; audio synthesis techniques rely heavily on
plugging sines into sines. For our scrolltext, we could make a sine
equation with a period of, say, 320, an amplitude of 90, and shift
it to the exact middle of the screen. However, this would result in
an unchanging sine pattern; that is, rather than slithering like a
snake, the sine pattern would hold still like a serpentine pipe
while the letters contorted through. It looks cool enough this way,
but there's no sense of motion. To add motion, we play games with
the phase; i.e., we keep cycling the phase so that the sine appears
waving, up and down, like a snake.</p><p>Now, how steep do you want the sine? Well, that's a function
of amplitude and period. Generally, we already have an idea of what
amplitude we want (usually either full-screen or just bouncing
along the bottom), so we play with our period. If you want a
scrolltext that squeezes together and then stretches out, you can
use a sine function to modulate the period. Now, we could also plug
a sine into the amplitude, to move between flat-lining and
squiggling, although it's not so useful.</p><p>Finally, you can also plug a sine into the shift in order to
give a lot more variety to the scroller as a whole. The result
actually looks quite neat, it's rather complex, yet visibly based
on sines. There's an aesthetic quality here to be appreciated, the
interplay between simplicity and complexity. In honor of sine
waves, let's also grind our processors a bit by using sines to
cycle the colors of our text; it'll look cool.</p><p>Now it's time for the code. Remember, it's just the same
simple procedure as in our last scrolltext episode, only now we're
using some sine equations to determine the <span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>
value for where our text gets placed, and a loop to draw out the
text one 1x8 strip at a time. It's simple conceptually, although if
you don't get it, try typing it in rather than downloading it and
you'll probably understand exactly what's going on by the time you
are done. Sines are some of the most useful things in the world, so
even though we're using them for something silly, they have
infinite practical use, and I hope this inspires some clever ideas
for you!</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9d580.0x1b95660"></a>Listing. Fun With Sines</h2></div></div><pre     class="programlisting">

people were talking about:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Microsoft's convenient web-based system on their
site that allows vendors to submit invoices. Michael Olson was
there and found this message: &ldquo;Note: Microsoft Invoice is not
compatible with Netscape Navigator, Apple MacIntosh computers, or
Linux.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Copyleft, a company dedicated to helping further
Open Source idealism, and their donation of $10,000 US to support
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The money is intended to
aid the legal defense the EFF is mounting in response to lawsuits
by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the DVD
Copy Control Association (DVD CCA). Show your appreciation: buy a
T-shirt. Visit their site at
<a href="http://www.copyleft.net" target="_self">http://www.copyleft.net/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Rumors that Microsoft is considering porting Office
to Linux. Arthur Tyde, executive vice president at Linuxcare, was
told there are 34 developers working on this very thing at
Microsoft.</p></li><li><p>The work done by Penguin Radio, Inc. and Ineva.com
work on a Linux-based car radio with the capacity to receive
thousands of stations. The radio hooks up with the the Ellipso
Satellite Internet service, which uses a unique (and patented)
system of satellite orbits to provide global Internet connectivity.
This won't happen until 2002. Huff!</p></li><li><p>An e-mail concerning a new ad for Microsoft's
Internet Explorer e-mail program. The ad uses &ldquo;Confutatis
Maledictis&rdquo; from Mozart's Requiem as its theme music. The chorus
sings &ldquo;Confutatis maledictis, flammis acribus addictis.&rdquo; This
translates to &ldquo;The damned and accursed are convicted to the flames
of hell.&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9d580.0x2120bf0"></a>STOP THE PRESSES: The Patent
Conversation</h2></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As we enjoy great advantages from the inventions
of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by
any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.
&mdash;Benjamin Franklin</p></blockquote></div><p>Patents are mines. They lay buried in the marketplace, doing
nothing until their owners blow them up under an enemy. That's what
Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos did last fall, when
Barnesandnoble.com stepped too close to Amazon's &ldquo;1-click&rdquo; patent
(No. 5,960,411). Amazon pressed a charge, and a court injunction
followed.
</p><p>The bomb worked. It stopped Barnesandnoble.com from copying
Amazon's work on the 1-click feature. It also blew Jeff's clothes
off. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span> magazine's Man of the Year&mdash;the
leading entrepreneur of the New Economy&mdash;was exposed as an
old-fashioned emperor of industry: a hard-ball player, a
pointy-haired litigator.</p><p>At least, that's the way it appeared to the Open Source
world, where captains of industry get the benefit of little doubt
in any case. Calling almost immediately for a boycott, the
conscience of free software, Richard Stallman, said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>This is an attack against the World Wide Web and
against e-commerce in general. The idea in question is that a
company can give you something which you can subsequently show them
to identify yourself for credit. This is nothing new: a physical
credit card does the same job, after all. But the U.S. Patent
Office issues patents on obvious and well-known ideas every day.
Sometimes the result is a disaster.</p></blockquote></div><p>Not much happened after that, at least on the surface. Behind
the scenes, however, Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly &amp; Associates
began a correspondence with Jeff Bezos.
</p><p>Then, on February 23, all hell broke loose. The United States
Patent &amp; Trademark Office assigned Amazon patent No. 6,029,141
for an &ldquo;Internet-based customer referral system&rdquo;. This covered
Amazon's popular associates program, by which thousands of sites
mount &ldquo;bookstores&rdquo; with sales fulfilled by Amazon.com. (To
witness the program's popularity, search for the phrase &ldquo;in
association with amazon.com&rdquo;.) There are many such programs
operating on the Web, but Amazon's was the first and easily the
most successful.</p><p>Amazon had applied for the patent back in 1997, but that
didn't cut much ice with the open-source folks. A roar went up, and
this time the press joined in. &ldquo;Loss-making Amazon turns to
bullying&rdquo;, wrote the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Irish Times</em></span>. For the
first time in its short life, Amazon.com was getting bad PR. If
they hadn't sued Barnesandnoble.com over a different patent, it is
unlikely anyone would have cared. In total, Amazon holds only seven
patents. By contrast, IBM obtained 2,697 patents in 1998
alone.</p><p>Amazon's patents were all applied for prior to the land rush
on &ldquo;business process&rdquo; and software patents after the floodgates
were opened by State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. vs. Signature
Financial Group Inc. On July 23, 1998, the Federal Court of Appeals
upheld a lower court ruling that threw out what little discretion
remained on the patenting of, well, nearly every marginally
original way of doing business, including &ldquo;processes&rdquo; conducted
by software. The Supreme Court later declined to review the
case.</p><p>So Amazon stood alone in the spotlight. Yes, other Internet
companies had sued to protect patents, but Amazon was the leading
e-commerce innovator. Their patent policy mattered.</p><p>Enter Tim O'Reilly. In a series of &ldquo;Ask Tim&rdquo; columns and
open letters, O'Reilly both challenged Bezos and invited him into
the growing patent reform movement. A series of private
conversations followed, culminating on March 10 with &ldquo;An open
letter from Jeff Bezos on the subject of patents&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/patents" target="_self">http://www.amazon.com/patents/</a>).</p><p>Crediting influence by O'Reilly, Bezos declared both his
intent not to harm software development and a newfound commitment
to patent reform. He did not hedge on his own patent policies, but
neither did he appear to push them off the negotiating table. He
also included a number of concrete proposals for reforming patent
law.</p><p>Suddenly, the PR turned around. Columnist Dan Gillmor of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury News</em></span>, who had labeled Bezos
one of technology's &ldquo;villains&rdquo; after the lawsuit against
Barnesandnoble.com, wrote, &ldquo;Bezos has a point on patents...&rdquo; and
&ldquo;...it's a heartening sign of the Internet's power, and Bezos'
management style, that this conversation is taking place at
all.&rdquo;</p><p>Will Bezos continue to straddle the fence? He faces a clear
choice between his lawyers and his market. As both he and O'Reilly
point out (crediting <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span>),
markets are conversations. If he stops talking, we'll know his
choice.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a9d580.0x2121430"></a>VENDOR NEWS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Andover.net</b></span> and
