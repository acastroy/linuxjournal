</p><p>To head off any misconceptions our spelling-challenged
readers might have after seeing the title, this book is not about
programming in Perl, even though the Perl language is referenced
twice. It is a revision of a book published in 1986 that comprised
an edited selection of columns Bentley wrote for the journal
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Communications of ACM</em></span>. ACM stands for the
Association for Computing Machinery, an organization of and for
hardware and software professionals and students, formed back
before computing technology was as specialized as it is today. As a
member in the late 60's and early 70's, I eagerly read Bentley's
columns, even though at times I became frustrated at not seeing the
solutions he offered until after reading the hints. His first
edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Pearls</em></span> became an
instant classic with examples from the languages C and FORTRAN, but
with pseudo-code for the algorithms and solutions so that one could
implement in one's favorite language. I used some of the ideas from
the book when designing and implementing application access
software for relatively large atmospheric science binary data files
from a CD-ROM data plate.</p><p>Since Bentley works at Bell Labs, he has had the opportunity
to consult on many interesting problems, the more interesting of
which he uses as examples in this book. There are 15 chapters which
he refers to as &ldquo;columns&rdquo; (because originally, each was based on
a column from <span   class="emphasis"><em>CACM</em></span>). Each includes a
discussion of the problem he considers, principles he believes one
can derive from that column, and problems for solution and/or
further thought. At the end of the book are hints (further
questions providing insightful ways of approaching a solution)
corresponding to each column's problem set, and outlines of
solutions in a section following the hints section. Each column
also has a section called &ldquo;Further Reading&rdquo;, where he lists books
or journal articles related to the column. It was a minor
disappointment that there was not a collected bibliography at the
end of the book, where all the further reading material was
properly referenced with ISBNs where possible.</p><p>Finally, some of the chapters have sidebars at the ends;
these are well-written narratives with interesting case studies or
anecdotes. I was particularly taken by sidebar 13.8, where he
presents Doug McIlroy's spelling checker. Fitting a dictionary list
of 75,000 English words in the 64KB address space of a PDP-11
computer sounds impossible. Even having Bentley explain the trail
of space-compressing techniques used and seeing timings for the
20-year-old &ldquo;spell&rdquo; doesn't take away the sense of awe.</p><p>To bring the second edition up to date, Bentley uses only C
and C++ example programs for his pseudo-code. He rewrote programs
for all the pseudo-code in the book, ran them on his 400MHz Pentium
II with 128MB of RAM running MS Windows NT 4.0 and presented the
timings in the appropriate columns. I would think if he really
wanted to be up to date, he would run them on Linux. That might be
a good exercise for someone playing with a Linux system who has
time on their hands: download Bentley's C and C++ programs, to see
how the times compare when run on a similar hardware setup. In
Appendix 1, &ldquo;A Catalog of Algorithms&rdquo;, Bentley provides college
instructors of algorithm courses with ways of presenting the
material in his book. Sorting, searching, string algorithms, vector
and matrix algorithms, generating pseudo-random integers and
numerical algorithms all have one or more sections.</p><p>Appendix 2 is a brief, back-of-the-envelope calculation quiz
to evaluate one's proficiency at making reasonable numeric guesses.
After trying it, I need more practice. Appendix 3 has cost models
of time and space; for computers, naturally. Appendix 4, Rules for
Code Tuning, comes from his 1982 book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Writing Efficient
Programs</em></span> and lists 27 rules. The main categories are
space-for-time rules, time-for-space rules, loop rules, logic
rules, procedure rules and expression rules. He lists them, then
references the section of the book which has examples. Appendix 5,
C++ Classes for Searching, is just what it says it is.</p><p>This second edition has lost nothing in the rewriting. I only
hope a new generation of programmers can appreciate it as much as
those of us who learned our approaches to solving programming
problems by reading the classic first edition.</p></div></div>
