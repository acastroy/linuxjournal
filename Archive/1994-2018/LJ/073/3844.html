    You don't have to wait until pigs fly for good list
    management&mdash;just call the mailman.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x28082f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I'm constantly inundated with e-mail from
friends, colleagues, users, developers, strangers, band-mates and
spammers. Sometimes it's hard to tell them apart. A closer look at
the nearly 2500 messages sitting in my inbox tells me most of these
messages are from some mailing list or other. All in all, I like
these mailing lists, perhaps because through them I communicate
with my co-workers and I get feedback from the community on the
open-source projects I maintain. The problem is, of course, that I
get too much e-mail to keep up with. I'm not alone in this either,
and the reasons are clear: e-mail mailing lists are great ways to
meet and converse with people who share common interests.
</p><p>There are probably a half dozen or more list-management
systems that folks are using to deposit e-mail messages into my
inbox. On python.org, we currently run about 60 mailing lists, most
of them technical SIGs (special interest groups) centered around
various Python topics. For a long time we used Majordomo, which was
the standard in free list-management systems. A few years ago we
started switching our lists over to Mailman, a GPL list manager
originally written by John Viega, and in 1999, we were finally able
to move all our mailing lists over to Mailman. In this article, I'd
like to talk about what Mailman is and focus on what the future of
Mailman might look like.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2808450"></a>Options and Benefits</h2></div></div><p>Mailman does all the common things you'd expect from a list
manager. It has built-in archiving, supports RFC934 and MIME digest
delivery, mail/Usenet gateways, e-mail-based administrative
commands, integrated bounce handling, spam detection, flexible SMTP
delivery, support for virtual domains, list moderation and more.
Mailman runs on almost any Linux or UNIX-type operating system, and
packages are available for most Linux distributions. You probably
don't care, but Mailman currently doesn't run on Windows.</p><p>The most striking thing about Mailman is that it's highly
integrated with the Web. Every mailing list has its own web page,
and almost all interaction with the system for both users and list
administrators can be done through the Web. This makes it easy to
use for both computer novices and experts. In fact, I run many
decidedly non-techy mailing lists, and most members can easily
follow the web pages to subscribe, unsubscribe and modify simple
parameters of their list subscriptions.</p><p>While list administrators are usually much more experienced
computer users, they too can have an easy time configuring and
managing their lists through the Web. Mailman's web administration
interface allows them to approve or deny closed-list subscription
requests, dispose of &ldquo;held&rdquo; postings (those that look
suspiciously like spam or are posted to a moderated list) and
configure the various operating parameters of their list.</p><p>Mailman's architecture is actually flexible enough to provide
several ways into the system. The web interface is augmented by
e-mail-based commands in the tradition of Majordomo. For list
administrators who have access to the command line on the Mailman
system, a large number of scripts are available for doing more
complex tasks. About the only thing a list administrator can't do
from the Web or e-mail is create and delete mailing lists, and we
hope to improve this in future versions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2808660"></a>Interacting with Mailman</h2></div></div><p>Mailman is written primarily in Python, with a few C modules
for improved security. The core functionality of Mailman is
implemented as a set of Python classes in a Python package. This
makes it easy to interact with Mailman in two novel ways (for the
hacker at heart). You can easily craft new scripts that use the
Python classes, and you can interact with a live Mailman
installation through the Python interactive interpreter. There's
even a convenience script provided by Mailman, called
bin/<span   class="bold"><b>withlist</b></span>, which does most of
the boiler plate of using a mailing list interactively. You can
invoke it like this from the command line in the directory where
Mailman is installed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
python -i bin/withlist -l mylist
</pre><p>This executes the withlist script, opening and locking
(<b  >-l</b>) the &ldquo;mylist&rdquo; mailing list. Afterwards,
you're left at the standard Python prompt with your open list
object bound to the name <b  >m</b>. You can then
interactively inspect (or change) the object from the Python
interpreter&mdash;a neat and very powerful feature.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2808920"></a>Getting and Building the Software</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned, Mailman was originally written by John Viega
who released the code under the GPL, so it has been officially
adopted by the GNU project. You can find more information on
Mailman at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html</a>,
which is mirrored at
<a href="http://www.list.org" target="_self">http://www.list.org/</a>.</p><p>Building Mailman from the source requires GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>, an ANSI C compiler
(<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> is, of course, fine) and
Python 1.5 or better, although I recommend at least Python 1.5.2.
All of these tools either come by default on your Linux
distribution or are readily downloadable and installable, e.g., by
RPM. To run Mailman you'll also need a web server, such as Apache,
and an SMTP daemon, such as Postfix, Exim, Qmail or Sendmail.
Building Mailman from the source in the gzipped tar file should be
straightforward for anyone who is familiar with GNU
<span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span>. Be sure to read the
various READMEs for specific configuration instructions related to
the MTA (mail transfer agent), web browser and OS you happen to be
using.</p><p>Mailman is officially at release 1.1, but the latest snapshot
is available via anonymous CVS. See the above URLs for details.
There have been some major architectural improvements in the CVS
tree (probably to be called version 1.2) and more coming soon. I'd
like to spend the rest of this article talking about some of those
changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2808c90"></a>The Message Pipeline</h2></div></div><p>I've spent a lot of time improving the common path a mail
message takes through the system. The biggest change has been to
design a message pipeline, where each component in the pipeline
does a little piece of the work necessary to deliver a message. For
example, there are separate components to scan the message for
potential spam, calculate the recipients of the message, archive
it, gate it to Usenet, and deliver the message to an SMTP (simple
mail transfer protocol) daemon.</p><p>Each component in the pipeline is really a Python module
conforming to a specific API: the module must contain a function
called &ldquo;process&rdquo; which takes a message object and a mailing list
object. When a message is received by Mailman, it runs through a
list of these modules, handing the message object off for each to
process. If the module raises a Python exception, processing is
stopped. This is used when messages must be held for the list
administrator's approval (e.g., a posting to a moderated
list).</p><p>This message pipeline means that Mailman is easily
configurable and extensible in the way it handles incoming and
outgoing messages. For example, there is a project contributor who
has implemented a MIME attachment scanner module which can be
dropped into the pipeline. This module can strip attachments from
the message, post the attachments to an external archive (either
the file system or a WebDAV server) and then rewrite the outgoing
message to include a URL to the attachment instead of the
attachment text. This module could also be used simply to discard
messages with certain types of attachments (e.g., if you hate HTML
mail as much as I do, you could just bounce or discard any message
that contains a text/html MIME type), strip certain attachment
types (e.g., binary attachments just get discarded) or scan
attachments for potential viruses.</p><p>Currently, there is only one system-wide message pipeline for
all Mailman lists at a site, but the plan is eventually to give
individual list administrators the opportunity to configure their
lists with optional modules. One application of this would be to
run a &ldquo;patches&rdquo; mailing list which would have an optional module
to scan a message for a context or unified
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span>, and if found, inject the
diff into an issue-tracking system.</p><p>This streamlining of the message-delivery path has vastly
improved the performance of Mailman. We're running the latest CVS
snapshot on python.org and easily handling about 30,000 individual
recipient deliveries per day, with an average of about 0.01 second
per message through the system (from Mailman receipt to SMTP daemon
hand-off). The lesson here is that for the best performance, you
want to choose your MTA wisely, since it will have the biggest
impact on throughput.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2808f50"></a>Bounce Pipeline</h2></div></div><p>A similar pipeline architecture has been designed for bounce
detection. Believe it or not, there's actually a standard for
bounced messages, called Delivery Status Notification (DSN),
described in RFC 1894. The problem is, of course, that it's
complex, and many MTA authors disagree with or ignore this
standard. This makes bounce detection (like spam detection) a black
art. Mailman 1.1 comes with a hairy mess of regular expressions
used to scan bounced messages, which get delivered to a different
address than regular postings. If Mailman actually detects a
bounce, and can extract the offending e-mail address from the
bounced message, it increments a counter for that address. Enough
bounces, and the address is automatically disabled or
removed.</p><p>The problem was that updating the regular expressions was
nearly impossible, so for Mailman 1.2 we now have a pipeline,
similar in architecture to the delivery pipeline, that attempts to
recognize just one style of bounce. We currently recognize
RFC1894/DSN bounces, Postfix, Qmail, Yahoo! and a few other
weirdos. Of course, we still recognize all the old bounce formats
Mailman 1.1 recognized, and it's fairly easy to add new
matchers&mdash;assuming the bounced message can actually be scanned
intelligently. I recently added an Smail bounce detector in about
five minutes and 20 lines of Python code.</p><p>Two other major improvements planned for the 1.2 release are
internationalization and user databases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2809108"></a>Internationalization</h2></div></div><p>We've had a large number of requests for making Mailman
multi-lingual. Two contributors from Spain, Juan Carlos Rey Anaya
and Victoriano Giralt, with help from Mads Kiilerich from Denmark,
have sent me patches to accomplish this. The technical approach
centers around <span   class="bold"><b>gettext</b></span>, where
strings to be translated are marked in a special way. The
developers then run a tool over the source tree and create template
files which can be handed over to translators. Once their
language-specific translation files are placed in the proper
directory, the application can use these to look up the text string
in the specified language.</p><p>For Mailman, a site administrator can install any language
file they want to make available to their list administrators. It
would be up to the list administrators to enable various languages
for their lists and to choose a default language. When individual
users are interacting with Mailman, they can choose their preferred
language from those available to the list. In this way, mailing
lists can support multiple languages through both their web and
e-mail interfaces. Of course, messages posted to the list aren't
translated (although a pipeline module could be implemented to feed
the text through Babelfish if you were so inclined).</p><p>GNU gettext provides all the necessary tools to create
multilingual C programs, but we had to adapt them a bit to work
with Python. As with C, we mark Python strings to be translated
with a wrapper function call. For example, if you wanted to make
this line of code translatable,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
subject = "You have been subscribed"
</pre><p>you would modify the line to look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
subject = _("You have been subscribed")
</pre>


Most of the work of making an application like Mailman multilingual
involves marking translatable text.
</p><p>Python has a further complication: there are actually eight
ways to define a &ldquo;string&rdquo;:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>'This is a Python string'</p></li><li><p>"This is a Python string"</p></li><li><p>'''This is a Python triple-quoted string'''</p></li><li><p>"""This is a Python triple-quoted string"""</p></li><li><p>r' This is a Python raw string'</p></li><li><p>r"This is a Python raw string"</p></li><li><p>r'''This is a Python triple quoted raw string'''</p></li><li><p>r"""This is a Python triple quoted raw string"""</p></li></ul></div><p>Briefly, the '' style and "" style strings are
interchangeable, and useful when you don't want to escape one
delimiter or the other. The first two string styles are limited to
a single line. Triple-quoted strings allow you to embed newlines in
the string, serving roughly the same purpose in Python as Perl's
HERE documents. Raw strings have different rules for embedded
backslashes and are used primarily for regular expressions.
</p><p>GNU gettext comes with a tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>xgettext</b></span> which scans your C files
for translatable strings. Unfortunately, it doesn't understand
Python's various string spellings, and while a few different
approaches have been put forward, I favor allowing
<b  >_()</b> marking of any valid Python string. To
accomplish this, I wrote a tool called
<span   class="bold"><b>pygettext.py</b></span> which scans Python
source code, looking for <b  >_()</b> wrappers around any
type of Python string. The output of pygettext.py is a standard
gettext .pot file, so from that point on, the GNU tools can be
used. <span   class="bold"><b>pygettext.py</b></span> will be a
standard part of Python 1.6 and is available via the Python CVS
tree at
<a href="http://cvs.python.org" target="_self">http://cvs.python.org/</a>.</p><p>I expect to begin integrating and testing the
internationalization patches to Mailman sometime within the next
few weeks. Keep an eye on the Mailman CVS tree for details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2710580.0x2c01fb8"></a>User Databases</h2></div></div><p>The other goal for the next release is to include real user
databases. A user should be able to have one Mailman login for all
lists of which they are members at a site. This login should
contain a list of all addresses to which messages can potentially
be delivered and should allow the user to select which mailing list
delivers to which address. Additionally, each user would need to
remember only one password to change their delivery options.</p><p>Currently, each Mailman list maintains its own list of member
addresses. This makes the data store relatively easy to implement
and recipient calculation fast, but it can be a real pain for users
who are subscribed to many lists at a particular site. For list
administrators who own multiple lists, it's even worse. For this
reason, we want to move toward having a real database of users and
administrators in the back end, using caching or other techniques
to make membership calculation perform acceptably. One of the core
Mailman maintainers has an implementation of this that he's
currently testing, and it is expected to be integrated some time
soon. This change may be significant enough to call the next
release of Mailman version 2.0.</p><p><a href="3844s1.html" target="_self">Mailman Mailing Lists</a></p></div></div>
