    If you are desinging a new web site, this language can
    provide just the help you need.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1030580.0x1128558"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the latest things to emerge in web
development is a language called PHP. According to its proponents
at <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_self">http://www.php.net/</a>, it
is in use by Volvo, Red Hat, Miss USA 1999, First USA Bank, NASA
JPL and other prominent organizations. One of its most popular
applications is connecting to databases, but it can also talk to
LDAP, IMAP and SNMP services, generate GIFs on the fly and do other
tricks.
</p><p>PHP3 is a server-side include scripting language and has been
compared to Microsoft ASP (Active Server Pages), but with two
differences crucial to me: it is open source and it runs on Linux.
Actually, it is available under a GNU license or the PHP license,
which allows commercial closed-source products to be developed from
it. It runs on many UNIX platforms.</p><p>What is a server-side include? Think of it as another
embedded language, like JavaScript, but which is converted to HTML
(or images, JavaScript or other possibilities) on the server. The
user's browser doesn't see the PHP code, just the results of
executing it. This protects the developer's work, enhances security
and bypasses things like conflicting implementations of
JavaScript.</p><p>For example, the following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;?PHP echo "Hello, Net" ?&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>in a PHP page on a PHP-enabled server will appear in the
user's browser as Hello, Net.
</p><p>What can PHP do for you? It greatly reduces the complexity of
using cgi-bin variables and connecting to databases, and allows
programming in an easy-to-learn language within web pages. It can
do much more (the on-line reference lists 53 types of functions),
but I will focus on database connectivity.</p><p>MySQL seems to be the most popular database to use with it,
so I will use that for my examples. PHP can connect to Oracle,
Sybase, PostgreSQL, Informix and other databases as well. It is
important to note that PHP is not database-independent, unlike the
DBI system used with Perl. You must use PHP functions tailored for
the database you are targeting. This lets PHP access functionality
available only in a specific database platform, but may reduce the
portability of database-enabled projects.</p><p>In the following discussion, I will assume the reader has a
knowledge of SQL, HTML and C.</p><p>I've already shown a &ldquo;Hello, World&rdquo; in PHP above. Note that
the entire PHP code is embedded in a single tag within the HTML.
The convention is to assign the extension .php3 to pages that
should be pre-processed by PHP, although this is configurable. The
page contains HTML (and whatever else the server and browser
support, such as JavaScript) with one or more <b  >&lt;?php
...<i><tt>php code</tt></i>... ?&gt;</b> blocks.
As I mentioned above, the PHP is evaluated and its output sent to
the browser, typically as HTML. PHP can also send any text language
or even generate images on the fly.</p><p>The PHP blocks can be included anywhere in the HTML&mdash;even
inside quotes or tags. For example, a link to another page could be
produced from PHP. The following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
...
For more information, visit &lt;A HREF=
"&lt;?php echo "moreinfo.html" ?&gt;"&gt; wacky link &lt;/A&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>would work, although there is little point to it. The value
of PHP is that it is a powerful programming language. It allows
things like links to be generated by code. One can build a whole
interactive web site with it.

unique features of its own. Here are some key facts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Variables are preceded by $ (just $, not @ or
anything else).</p></li><li><p>Primitive types include integers, floats, strings,
arrays, associative arrays and objects.</p></li><li><p>Type is usually set automatically, not in code, so
there is no need to declare variables. They can be declared as
<span   class="bold"><b>static</b></span> which makes them persist
between PHP blocks on the same page.</p></li><li><p>//, /*..*/ and # are all used for comments&mdash;sort of
a combination of C++, Perl and shell scripting.</p></li><li><p>Statements are terminated by semicolons.</p></li><li><p>Functions can be declared within a block. Their
declaration and call resemble C.</p></li><li><p>Forms submitted to a PHP script pass in their
variables (this is quite cool). They are accessible by name and
also come in an array, which is nice when your calling form is a
PHP program that may have unpredictable variable names.</p></li><li><p>The set of control structures and operators is very
similar to C, although with some extensions.</p></li><li><p>There is limited support for object types.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1030580.0x1129370"></a>Diving In</h2></div></div><p><a href="3658l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Listing 1 is two examples of PHP code to show some of its
features. The first page accepts two numbers to add a first and
last name. The passing of the form variables to be used in the next
page happens automatically, which is one of the neatest things
about PHP. This doesn't check their type&mdash;that they are actually
numbers&mdash;in order to give an error. It does show the way PHP can be
used to send and receive information to the user.</p><p><a href="3658l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p><a href="3658l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Listing 2 is an example that generates CGI variables on the
fly, and the receiving page (Listing 3) deals with any incoming
variables generated. If you run this in a PHP-enabled server,
you'll see the variables passed in the cgi-call in the location
line of the browser. All Listing 3 does is echo the names of the
variables, but it demonstrates a technique that would enable a web
site to generate a list on the fly and allow the user to make
selections&mdash;like a shopping cart.</p><p><a href="3658l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Now let's connect to a MySQL database. The following code
would connect as root to a database named &ldquo;stores&rdquo; on the local
host, with password &ldquo;tiger&rdquo;. It executes a query against a parts
table, counts the number of rows in the query to check for the
actual data, and if it exists, the result is displayed as an HTML
table with check boxes to select items. Listing 4 is the PHP code
preceded by the structure of the table. Note that knowing the
number of rows is handy for determining whether to display the
query at all (if there is any information) as well as counting down
until no data is left. Each row of data is a row in an HTML table,
with the fields walked through by number. The array containing the
row from the query can be addressed by number or by field name, so
you could also execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$partno=$row["partno"]
</pre><p>This can be advantageous during development when field
positions in the table or query may be changing more often than
names.
</p><p>The next page of HTML (called in the FORM command) will
receive the checked-off selections as CGI variables, which can be
retrieved even though their names are unknown, using the technique
shown above. It will then insert into another table the items that
have been checked off. See Listing 5.</p><p><a href="3658l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1030580.0x11299a0"></a>Installation Information</h2></div></div><p>The latest information on installing PHP is available at
http://www.php.net/ or in the distribution itself. I have installed
it for FreeBSD, Linux and Win32 using their supplied packages. I
have installed it only for Apache, although it is supposed to work
with other web servers. It is supplied as source code for platforms
other than Win32. The installation for Apache requires recompiling
Apache to add it in as a module, although if that is not an option,
it can be installed as a binary and scripts can be run as cgi-bin
scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1030580.0x1129aa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I've found PHP3 to be a very enjoyable and versatile language
for web applications. As of this writing, the next version&mdash;which
is primarily billed as a performance improvement&mdash;is in beta
testing. (PHP 4.0 includes the ZEND engine; see their web site for
details.)</p><p><a href="3658s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
