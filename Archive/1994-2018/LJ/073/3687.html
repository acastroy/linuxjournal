    A technique for developers that will provide them with much
    flexibility in design.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1703558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux has much to offer as a development
platform: a robust operating environment with tested tools. Linux
also boasts implementations of just about every programming
language available. I think it is safe to say, however, that among
compiled languages, C is the language of choice for most Linux
developers. Consequently, other languages such as C++ seem to be
somewhat neglected in most discussions of Linux development.
</p><p>The dynamic class loading technique provides developers with
a great deal of flexibility in their designs. Dynamic class loading
is a means of providing extensibility without sacrificing
robustness.</p><p>In this article, we will design a simple application that
defines a single class, a shape class we wish to use in a drawing
package. As we shall see, dynamic class loading allows us to
provide a smooth extension path through which users of the
application can add new types of shapes without needing to modify
the original application code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1703710"></a>Polymorphism</h2></div></div><p>The basic idea behind dynamic class loading is the concept of
polymorphism. Anyone familiar with C++ should be familiar with this
concept, so I will discuss it here only briefly. In short,
polymorphism is the ability of an object belonging to a derived
class to act as an object belonging to the base class. This is the
familiar &ldquo;is a&rdquo; relationship of OOP (object-oriented programming)
parlance. For example, in the following code snippet,
<span   class="bold"><b>circle</b></span> is a class derived from the
base class <span   class="bold"><b>shape</b></span> (see Listing 1),
so the object <b  >my_circle</b> can act as a shape
object, invoking the shape member function
<span   class="bold"><b>draw</b></span>.</p><p><a href="3687l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><pre     class="programlisting">
class shape { public:
   void draw();
};
class circle : public shape { };
int main(int argc, char **argv){
   circle my_circle;
   my_circle.draw();
}
</pre><p>While this has all the usual advantages, e.g., code reuse,
the real power of polymorphism comes into play when draw is
declared to be virtual or pure virtual, as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
class shape{ public:
   virtual void draw()=0;
};
class circle : public shape { public:
   void draw();
}
</pre>


Here, circle has declared its own draw function, which can define
behavior appropriate for a circle. Similarly, we could define other
classes derived from shape, which provide their own versions of
draw. Now, because all the classes implement the shape interface,
we can create collections of objects that can provide different
behavior invoked in a consistent manner (calling the draw member
function). An example of this is shown here.
<pre     class="programlisting">
shape *shape_list[3];   // the array that will
                            // pointer to our shape objects
shape[0] = new circle;  // three types of shapes
shape[1] = new square;  // we have defined
shape[2] = new triangle;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
   shape_list[i].draw();
}
</pre>


When we invoke the draw function for each object on the list, we do
not need to know anything about each object; C++ handles the
details of invoking the correct version of draw. This is a very
powerful technique, allowing us to provide extensibility in our
designs. Now we can add new classes derived from shape to provide
whatever behavior we desire. The key here is that we have separated
the interface (the prototype for shape) from the implementation.
</p><p>While this technique is very powerful, it does suffer from a
drawback in that we must recompile (or at least relink) our code
when we add new derived classes. It would be more convenient if we
could simply load in new classes at runtime. Then, anyone using our
code libraries could provide new shape classes (with new draw
functions) without even needing our original source code. The good
news, and the subject of this article, is that we can.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1703be0"></a>dlopen and Dynamic Class Loading</h2></div></div><p>While C++ has no direct mechanism under Linux for loading in
classes at runtime, there is a direct mechanism for loading C
libraries at runtime: the dl functions
<span   class="bold"><b>dlopen</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dlsym</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>dlerror</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>dlclose</b></span>. These functions provide
access to the dynamic linker <span   class="bold"><b>ld</b></span>. A
complete description of these functions is provided in the
appropriate man page, so they are presented here only
briefly.</p><p>The prototypes for the functions are as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void *dlopen(const char
void *dlsym(void *handle, char *symbol);
const char *dlerror();
int dlclose(void *handle);
</pre><p>The dlopen function opens the file given in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> so that the symbols in the file can
be accessed via the dlsym function. <b  >flag</b> can
take one of two values: <b  >RTLD_LAZY</b> or
<b  >RTLD_NOW</b>. If <b  >flag</b> is set to
<b  >RTLD_LAZY</b>, dlopen returns without attempting to
resolve any symbols. If <b  >flag</b> is set to
<b  >RTLD_NOW</b>, dlopen attempts to resolve any
undefined symbols in the file. Failure to resolve a symbol causes
the call to fail, returning a NULL.
<span   class="bold"><b>dlerror</b></span> can be used to provide an
error message explaining the failure. The dlsym function is used to
obtain a pointer to the functions (or other symbols) provided by
the library. <b  >handle</b> is the pointer to the thing
being referenced, and <b  >symbol</b> is the actual
string name of the item referenced, as it is stored in the file.
</p><p>Given that we can use these functions to access functions in
a C library, how do we use them to access classes in a C++ library?
There are several problems to overcome. One is that we must be able
to locate the symbols we need in the library. This is trickier than
it might seem because of the difference between the way symbols are
stored in C and C++ files. Secondly, how can we create objects
belonging to the classes we load? Finally, how can we access those
objects in a useful manner? I will answer these three questions in
reverse.</p><p>Since we do not have the prototypes for the classes we load
dynamically, how can we access them in our code? The answer to this
lies in the description of polymorphism in the preceding section.
We access the functionality of the new classes through the common
interface provided by their base class. Following the examples
above, any new shape classes would provide a draw function that
would allow an object of that class to render itself.</p><p>Fine; we can use pointers to the base class to access objects
from the derived classes. How do we create the objects in the first
place? We don't know anything about the classes that might be
loaded, other than the fact that they conform to the shape
interface. For instance, suppose we dynamically load a library that
provides a class called <span   class="bold"><b>hexapod</b></span>.
We can't write</p><pre     class="programlisting">
shape *my_shape = new hexapod;
</pre><p>if we don't know the class name ahead of time.
</p><p>The solution is that our main program doesn't create the
objects, at least not directly. The same library that provides the
class derived from shape must provide a way to create objects of
the <span   class="bold"><b>new</b></span> class. This could be done
using a <span   class="bold"><b>factory</b></span> class, as in the
factory design pattern (see Resources) or more directly using a
single function. To keep things simple, we will use a single
function here. The prototype for this function is the same for all
shape types:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
shape *maker();
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>maker</b></span> takes no arguments and
returns a pointer to the constructed object. For our hexapod class,
maker might look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
shape *maker(){
   return new hexapod;
}
</pre>


It is perfectly legal for us to use
<span   class="bold"><b>new</b></span> to create the object, since
maker is defined in the same file as hexapod.
</p><p>Now, when we use dlopen to load a library, we can use dlsym
to obtain a pointer to the maker function for that class. We can
then use this pointer to construct objects of the class. For
example, suppose we want to dynamically link a library called
libnewshapes.so which provides the hexapod class. We proceed as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void *hndl = dlopen("libnewshapes.so", RTLD_NOW);
if(hndl == NULL){
   cerr &lt;&lt; dlerror() &lt;&lt; endl;
   exit(-1);
}
void *mkr = dlsym(hndl, "maker");
</pre><p>The pointer to maker must be of type <b  >void
*</b>, since that is the type returned by dlsym. Now we can
create objects of the hexapod class by invoking
<span   class="bold"><b>mkr</b></span>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
shape *my_shape = static_cast&lt;shape *()&gt;(mkr)();
</pre>


We are required to cast mkr to a pointer to a function returning
<b  >shape&nbsp;*</b> when we invoke it.
</p><p>Some readers may see a problem with the code as written thus
far: the dlsym call is likely to fail because it cannot resolve
<b  >"maker"</b>. The problem is that C++ function names
are mangled to support function overloading, so the maker function
may have a different name in the library. We could figure out the
mangling scheme and search for the mangled symbol instead, but
fortunately there is a much simpler solution. We need only tell the
compiler to use C-style linkage using the
<b  >extern&nbsp;"C"</b> qualifier, as shown in Listing
2.</p><p><a href="3687l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x1704c60"></a>Autoregistration</h2></div></div><p>Loading the maker functions into an array associates a
position in the array with each maker. While this may be useful in
some cases, we can obtain more flexibility using an associative
array to hold the makers. The Standard Template Library (STL)
<span   class="bold"><b>map</b></span> class works well for this, as
we can then assign key values to the makers and access them via
these values. For example, we may desire to assign string names to
each class and use these names to invoke the appropriate maker. In
this case, we can create a map such as this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef shape *maker_ptr();
 map &lt;string, maker_ptr&gt; factory;
</pre><p>Now when we want to create a particular shape, we can invoke
the proper maker using the shape name:
<pre     class="programlisting">
shape *my_shape = factory[
</pre>


We can extend this technique to make it even more flexible. Rather
than loading the class makers in and explicitly assigning a key
value to them, why not let the class designers do the work for us?
Using a little bit of ingenuity, we can have the makers register
themselves with the factory automatically, using whatever key value
the class designer chooses. (There are a couple of warnings here.
The key must be of the same type as all the other keys, and the key
value must be unique.)
</p><p>One way to accomplish this would be to include a function in
each shape library that registers the maker for us, and then call
this function every time we open a shape library. (According to the
dlopen man page, if your library exports a function called
<span   class="bold"><b>_init</b></span>, this function will be
executed when the library is opened. This may seem to be the ideal
place to register our maker, but currently the mechanism is broken
on Linux systems. The problem is a conflict with a standard linker
object file, crt.o, which exports a function called _init.) As long
as we are consistent with the name of this function, the mechanism
works well. I prefer to forego that approach in favor of one that
will register the maker simply by opening the library. This
approach is known as &ldquo;self-registering objects&rdquo; and was
introduced by Jim Beveridge (see Resources).</p><p>We can create a proxy class used solely to register our
maker. The registration occurs in the constructor for the class, so
we need to create only one instance of the proxy class to register
the maker. The prototype for the class is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class proxy {
public:
   proxy(){
      factory["shape name"] = maker;
   }
};
</pre><p>Here, we assume factory is a global map exported by the main
program. Using
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>egcs</b></span>,
we would be required to link with the <b  >rdynamic</b>
option to force the main program to export its symbols to the
libraries loaded with dlopen.
</p><p>Next, we declare one instance of the proxy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proxy p;
</pre><p>Now when we open the library, we pass the
<b  >RTLD_NOW</b> flag to dlopen, causing
<b  >p</b> to be instantiated, thus registering our
maker. If we want to create a circle, we invoke the circle maker
like so:
<pre     class="programlisting">
shape *my_circle = factory["circle"];
</pre>


The autoregistration process is powerful because it allows us to
design the main program without having explicit knowledge of the
classes we will support. For instance, after the main program
dynamically loads any shape libraries, it could create a shape
selection menu using all the keys registered in the factory. Now
the user can select &ldquo;circle&rdquo; from a menu list, and the program
will associate that selection with the proper maker. The main
program does not need any information about the circle class as
long as the class supports the shape API and its maker is properly
defined.
</p><p><a href="3687l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Listings 1 through 5 pull together the concepts presented
thus far. The shape class defined in Listing 1 is the base class
for all shapes. Listings 2 and 3 are the source code for
dynamically loadable libraries that provide circle and square
shapes, respectively.</p><p><a href="3687l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Listing 4 is the main program that is extensible through
dynamically loaded libraries. It scans the current directory for
any .so files (libraries) and opens them. The libraries then
register their makers with the global factory provided by the main
program. The program then dynamically constructs a menu for the
user with the shape names registered by the libraries. Using the
menu, the user can construct shapes, draw the shapes constructed,
or exit the program. Listing 5 is the makefile used to build the
project.</p><p><a href="3687l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x16fbee8"></a>Real-World Examples</h2></div></div><p>Recently, I have had two occasions to use this technique. In
the first case, I was developing a moving object simulation. I
wanted to provide users with the ability to add new types of moving
objects without having access to the main source. In order to
accomplish this, I defined a base class called entity, which
provides the interface definition for any moving object in the
simulation. A simplified version of the entity prototype is shown
below.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class entity {
private:
   float xyz[3];  // position of the object
public:
   activate(float)=0; // tell the object to move
   render()=0;  // tell the object to draw itself
};
</pre><p>Thus, all entities have at least a position in three-space,
and all entities can draw themselves. Most entities will have many
other state variables besides position and may have many other
member functions besides <span   class="bold"><b>activate</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>render</b></span>, but these are not
accessible through the entity interface.
</p><p>New entity types can be defined, incorporating whatever
motion dynamics the user desires. At runtime, the program loads all
the libraries in a subdirectory called Entity and makes them
available to the simulation.</p><p>The second example comes from a recent project in which we
wanted to create a library that could load and save images of
various formats. We wanted the library to be extensible, so we
created a base <span   class="bold"><b>image_handler</b></span> class
for loading and saving images.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class image_handler{
public:
   virtual Image loadImage(char *)=0;
   virtual int saveImage(char *, Image &amp;)=0;
};
</pre><p>The image_handler has two public functions, used to load and
save images, respectively. The
<span   class="bold"><b>Image</b></span> class is the library's basic
object type for images. It provides access to the image data and
some basic image-manipulation functions.
</p><p>In this case, we were not interested in creating multiple
objects of each type of image_handler. Instead, we wanted one
instance of each image_handler that would handle loading and saving
images of that type. Rather than registering a maker for each
handler, we created a single instance of the handler in its library
and registered a pointer to it with a global map. The map is no
longer a factory, since it does not produce objects per se; it is
more of a generic image loader/saver. The keys used here were
strings representing file extensions (tif, jpg, etc.). Because a
file format can have one of several different extensions (e.g.,
tiff, TIFF), each handler registers itself multiple times with the
global map, once for each extension.</p><p>Using the library, a main program can load or save an image
simply by invoking the correct handler via the file
extension:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
map &lt;string, handler, less&lt;string&gt;&gt; handler_map;
char *filename = "flower.tiff";
char ext[MAX_EXT_LEN];
<span   class="emphasis"><em>howEverYouWantToParseTheExtensions</em></span>(filename, ext);&lt;\n&gt;
// after parsing "flower.tiff" ext = "tiff"&lt;\n&gt;
Image img1 = handler_map[ext]-&gt;loadImage(filename);
// process data here
handler_map[ext]-&gt;saveImage(filename, img1);
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x160b580.0x16fc4c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Dynamic class loading allows us to create more extensible and
more robust code. By using dynamic class loading combined with
well-thought-out base class designs, we provide users with a
practical means of extending our code.</p><p><a href="3687s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
