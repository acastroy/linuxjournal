    Getting DB2 up and running on Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a62450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you been trying to install DB2
Universal Database on a Linux-based workstation? Did you run into
some troubles? As I scan around the DB2 and Linux newsgroups, I
hear from many of users who are getting frustrated when trying to
get DB2 running on Linux. How did this problem get so big? Well,
the Linux phenomenon is relatively new and ever-changing. Recently,
all sorts of vendors are flocking to market their distributions,
with slight differences between them all. Combine that with what
seems to be quarterly releases and you can see how communication
channels between the Linux vendors and the people who build
applications to run on them get clogged. While efforts are being
made between application developers and Linux vendors to define
this communication pipe, you can use the information in this
article to get yourself up and running in no time at all.
</p><p>DB2 for Linux is officially supported on the following Linux
distributions: Caldera OpenLinux, Red Hat Linux, TurboLinux and
SuSE Linux. This article will take you through the steps involved
in installing DB2 on each of the supported Linux distributions. In
the article, I assume you have not previously installed a version
of DB2 and you are not maintaining any of the default users created
by a default DB2 Installation. The three user IDs that will be
created during a DB2 installation are: db2inst1, db2fenc1 and
db2as. If you have any of these users on your system, be sure to
remove them and their associated directories before installing DB2.
This article also assumes you are familiar with the
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> command, used to install
packages. If you are not familiar with this command, refer to your
Linux documentation.</p><p>In order to run DB2 on Linux, the following are
required:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux kernel 2.0.35 or higher</p></li><li><p>RPM (package manager)</p></li><li><p>pdksh package (public domain Korn shell)</p></li><li><p>glibc version 2.0.7 or higher</p></li><li><p>libstdc++ version 2.8.0</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a62a28"></a>Preparing Your Linux Workstation for a DB2
Installation</h2></div></div><p>The following sections will highlight any actions you need to
perform on your Linux workstation to enable it for a DB2
installation. If a requirement exists by default on your system, I
will not make note of it in the sections that follow. Keep in mind
that the lag time between when this article was written and when
you are going to read it may be a couple of months. In that time,
some of the levels or links I have referred to here may have
changed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a62b30"></a>DB2 and Caldera OpenLinux</h2></div></div><p>The information I am providing in this section is based on a
Caldera OpenLinux version 2.3, or simply Caldera, Standard
Installation type. If you installed a different installation type
on your Linux workstation, you may have to add some of the required
packages to your workstation.</p><p>The pdksh package is missing from the default Standard
Installation. This package is available on the Caldera CD-ROM;
however, it is not compatible with DB2. IBM and Caldera are working
to solve this problem, but in the meantime, I recommend you
download a pdksh package from a Red Hat mirror site&mdash;it will work
just fine. I am sure Caldera Systems will post a fix sometime on
their FTP site at
<a href="ftp://ftp.calderasystems.com/pub" target="_self">ftp://ftp.calderasystems.com/pub/</a>.</p><p>For now, go to the mirror site at
<a href="http://www.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/redhat/redhat-6.1/i386/RedHat/RPMS" target="_self">http://www.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/redhat/redhat-6.1/i386/RedHat/RPMS/</a>.
Download the pdksh-5.2.14-1.i386.rpm package and install it with
the rpm command using the <b  >-nodeps</b> option. If you
try to install this package without the <b  >-nodeps</b>
option, you will receive an error stating that this package has a
requirement on the glibc package. This error is only a result of
the different naming conventions used by Caldera Systems and Red
Hat. A glibc package is installed by default.</p><p>For DB2 version 6, you require libstdc++ 2.80, DB2 v6 will
not run with libstdc++ 2.9.0. Caldera version 2.3 by default
installs with libstdc++ 2.9.0. The required libstdc++ 2.8.0 is
located on the CD-ROM in the /col/contrib/RPMS directory as a
package called libstdc++-compat-2.8.0-1.i386.rpm.</p><p>If you are running Caldera version 2.2, I recommend that you
upgrade to version 2.3; it will make your DB2 installation much
easier. In the event you do not want to do this, there are some
things you will need to note on top of the issues I mentioned for
Caldera version 2.3.</p><p>First, the libstdc++-compat-2.8.0-1.i386.rpm package, is not
on the CD-ROM. You can get it from Caldera at
<a href="ftp://ftp.calderasystems.com/pub/openlinux/2.3/contrib/RPMS" target="_self">ftp://ftp.calderasystems.com/pub/openlinux/2.3/contrib/RPMS/</a>.</p><p>Finally, DB2 requires a file called libcrypt.so.1 to work.
This file is usually shipped with every Linux distribution. Some
problems with federal export laws caused Caldera version 2.2 to
ship without this file. To add this file to your workstation,
download the package glibc-crypt-2.1-3i.i386.rpm from
<a href="ftp://ftp.linuxland.de/pub/OpenLinux/crypto/2.2/RPMS" target="_self">ftp://ftp.linuxland.de/pub/OpenLinux/crypto/2.2/RPMS/</a>.
I could not find this fix on Caldera's FTP site.</p><p>Once you have completed these tasks, your Caldera version 2.2
workstation is ready for a DB2 installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a630b0"></a>DB2 and TurboLinux</h2></div></div><p>The information I provide in this section is based on a
TurboLinux version 3.6 Base Workstation installation. If you
installed a different installation type on your Linux workstation,
you may have to add some of the required packages to your
workstation.</p><p>There are some problems trying to get DB2 to run on a
workstation running TurboLinux. Download a fix from the Web at:
<a href="ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/db2/tools" target="_self">ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/db2/tools/</a>.
The fix is called tl36_instfix.tar.Z, note that the l is the letter
&ldquo;l&rdquo; not the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; All the information you require to
implement this fix is mentioned in the README file called
tl36_instfix.readme.txt.</p><p>After you have downloaded the fix, you need to add the pdksh
package, which is not part of the Base Workstation installation.
This file is available on the TurboLinux CD-ROM, in the
/TurboLinux/RPMS directory.</p><p>Once you have completed these tasks, your TurboLinux version
3.62 workstation is ready for a DB2 installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a63318"></a>DB2 for SuSE Linux</h2></div></div><p>The information that I am providing in this section is based
on a SuSE version 6.3 Network Oriented System installation. These
instructions also apply to a workstation running SuSE version 6.2.
If you installed a different installation type on your Linux
workstation, you may have to add some of the required packages to
your workstation.</p><p>The biggest problem with installing DB2 on a workstation that
is running SuSE Linux is the naming convention that SuSE uses for
its packages. For example, SuSE calls the required glibc package
shlibs. This will causes problems when you try to install DB2
because the DB2 installation utility will fail to recognize the
existence of the required glibc package. To get around this
problem, you have to install a dummy package, called
glibc-2.0.7-0.i386.rpm. This package is located in the
/db2/install/dummyrpm directory on your DB2 product CD-ROM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a63478"></a>Additional Steps for SuSE Version 6.1</h2></div></div><p>SuSE Linux version 6.1 ships with a beta copy of the DB2 for
Linux version 5.2 code. Consequently, when you go to install DB2,
this causes problems with the default users. To make things ever
stranger, I noticed that when I installed the Network Oriented
System installation, which was not supposed to include DB2, the
default DB2 users were created. To make matters worse, I could not
find any information about the passwords for the DB2 users that
SuSE creates (they are not the default DB2 passwords), and some of
the settings that SuSE implements do not work for DB2. In the end,
remove the users (db2inst1, db2as, db2fenc1) that the SuSE
installation creates. For more information on SuSE user management,
refer to your product's documentation.</p><p>Once you have completed these tasks, your SuSE version 6.1
workstation is ready for a DB2 installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a635d8"></a>DB2 and Red Hat Linux</h2></div></div><p>The information I provide in this section is based on a Red
Hat version 6.0 Server installation. These instructions also apply
to a workstation that is running Red Hat version 5.2, though the
names of the packages may be at a different level. If you installed
a different installation type on your Linux workstation, you may
have to add some of the required packages to your
workstation.</p><p>Both the Red Hat version 5.2 and version 6.0 installation are
easy to enable for a DB2 installation. They are both missing the
required pdksh package that is required to run the DB2 Installer.
This package is located in the /RedHat/RPMS directory on the Red
Hat CD-ROM.</p><p>If you are trying to install DB2 on a workstation that is
running Red Hat version 6.1, you aren't going to get very far due
to a problem with this version of Red Hat v6.1 and DB2. You can
download the Red Hat fix at
<a href="ftp://ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/db2/tools" target="_self">ftp.software.ibm.com/ps/products/db2/tools</a>.
The fix you need depends on where you got your DB2 code. If you are
installing the copy of DB2 bundled with Red Hat 6.1, download the
file db2rh61fix.tgz. If you are installing any other DB2 code, you
need to download the db2rh61gafix.tgz file.</p><p>After you download the appropriate fix, unpack them by
entering the <b  >tar xvzf
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> command, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> is the name of the downloaded fix
file. After unpacking this file, you will see three files in the
directory. Once of them is a README file, called readme.txt. This
file gives complete and detailed instructions on how to implement
this fix.</p><p>Once you have completed these tasks, your Red Hat version 6.1
workstation is ready for a DB2 installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x196a580.0x1a639a0"></a>Installing DB2</h2></div></div><p>Installing DB2 is made easy by an installation and setup
utility called DB2 Installer. This utility will install all
required packages for DB2, create instances for DB2 databases and
administration support, and configure your DB2 server for
communications. The instructions in this section assume you do not
change any of the defaults presented by DB2 Installer, unless noted
in the steps below.</p><p>You will usually run into display problems if you start DB2
Installer from a command window in your Linux distribution's
graphical interface. You can refresh the view of DB2 Installer at
any time by pressing <b  >CTRL</b>-L. To avoid most
potential display problems, I recommend running the DB2 Installer
in a virtual console session outside of your operating system's
graphical interface. You can shift between the virtual console
session and the graphical interface session on most Linux
distributions by pressing
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >F1</b>
and
<b  >CTRL</b>-<b  >ALT</b>-<b  >F7</b>.
Refer to your Linux documentation for more details.</p><p>To quickly install DB2, perform the following steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Log on to the system as a user with root
authority</p></li><li><p>Mount the DB2 product CD-ROM by entering the
following command:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>where /mnt/cdrom is the mount point of the CD-ROM.
Note that even if you are installing DB2 on a workstation that is
running TurboLinux version 3.6 or Red Hat Linux version 6.1, you
still need to mount the CD-ROM. The image created by the install
fix links to the DB2 CD-ROM. For more information, refer to your
fix's readme.txt file.</p></li><li><p>Change focus to the mount point of the CD-ROM. Note
that if you were installing DB2 on a workstation that is running

level to use the DB2 Administration Tools. For more information,
refer to the Control Center README, which can be found in the
INSTHOME/sqllib/cc/prime directory, where INSTHOME is the home
directory of the user created for the instance during the
installation (for example, /home/db2inst1/sqllib/cc/prime). Let me
save you some time and take you through the quickest way I found to
get the graphical tools running on your workstation. Perform the
following steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Log on to your workstation as a user with root
authority</p></li><li><p>In order to run the graphical tools, you need to be
running at least Java 1.1.7 v3 or later. A JRE is available from
the Blackdown web site at
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html" target="_self">www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.html</a>.
For this example, I visited the mirror site at:
<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/devel/lang/java/blackdown.org/JDK-1.1.7/i386/glibc/v3" target="_self">ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/devel/lang/java/blackdown.org/JDK-1.1.7/i386/glibc/v3/</a>,
downloaded the jre_1.1.7-v3-glibc-x86-native.tar.gz file and placed
it in the /tmp directory. For all the latest information on
supported JREs and browsers, go to
<a href="http://www.software.ibm.com/data/db2" target="_self">http://www.software.ibm.com/data/db2/</a>.</p></li><li><p>Note that you must download the native threads
version of the JRE that you want to use. The DB2 Control Center
does not support green threads.</p></li><li><p>Once you have downloaded an appropriate JRE, unpack
the file by entering the following command:</p></li><li><p>tar xvfz
jre_1.1.7-v3-glibc-x86-native.tar.gz</p></li><li><p>Log on to your workstation as the db2inst1
user.</p></li><li><p>Update your PATH so that your workstation knows the
location of the JRE's binary files just installed. Assuming you are
following along the example, for Bash or Bourne shells enter this
command:
<b  >export&nbsp;PATH=/tmp/jre117_v3/bin:$PATH</b>; for C
shell enter:
<b  >setenv&nbsp;PATH&nbsp;/tmp/jre117_v7/bin:${PATH}</b>,
where /tmp/jre117_v7/bin is the path to the downloaded JRE binary
files.</p></li><li><p>Start the JDBC Applet Server by entering the
following command: <b  >db2jstrt&nbsp;6790</b>.</p></li><li><p>Start a graphical administration tool. For this
example, let's start the Control Center using the command
<b  >db2cc&nbsp;6790</b>.</p></li><li><p>The Control Center Sign On window opens. Enter a
valid DB2 user that has SYSADM authority on the instance with which
you intend to work. For our example, enter the db2inst user ID and
the corresponding password. For more information, refer to the
&ldquo;Administration Guide&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div><p>Now, you have completed all the steps necessary to configure
your workstation for the DB2 graphical tools.
</p><p>If you followed the steps and considerations that I have
outlined in this article, you should have a running copy of DB2 on
your Linux workstation, a sample database, a running Control Center
and a smile on your face!</p></div></div>
