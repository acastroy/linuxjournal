All were released in
late 1999, doubling the number of available titles on
Python.</p><p>Let me show my prejudices right away. Guido van Rossum wrote
the forward to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Essential Reference</em></span>.
This immediately made me expect more from this title, and I feel it
delivered more.</p><p>Its intended audience is experienced programmers. While the
first chapter is called &ldquo;A Tutorial Introduction&rdquo;, it is less
than 11 pages long and would be of little use to a newcomer to
programming. If, however, you are new to Python but not to
programming, the chapter is a good introduction.</p><p>The next chapter, only four pages long, introduces you to the
Lexical Conventions and Syntax of Python. While this sounds
extremely short, Python has a very simple syntax and the chapter
does cover the material.</p><p>The book continues in this local fashion with Chapter 3
discussing Types and Objects, Chapter 4 Operators and Expressions
and, in Chapter 5, Control Flow. All this material is covered in
the first 53 pages of the book. Being an experienced programmer, I
found the coverage adequate and I didn't get bored or bogged
down.</p><p>We continue the fast pace with Chapters 6 through 9 on
Functions, Object, Modules and Classes. The final two chapters
cover I/O and the execution environment. While these are the last
sections labeled &ldquo;chapters&rdquo;, we are still only on page 86. Next
comes all the reference information. Labeled A and B, the first is
titled &ldquo;The Python Library&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;Extending and
Embedding Python&rdquo;. The section on the library goes from pages 87
through 245 and does what you would expect for a library
reference.</p><p>As with C, much of the power is in the library rather than in
the language itself, and section A does an excellent job of
covering the material. It is logically divided (Built-in Functions
and Exceptions, Python Services, Mathematics, String Handling and
so forth) and then the functions are listed alphabetically within
each division.</p><p>Each division starts with introductory information. For
example, Threads starts with Thread Basics and Python Threads
before introducing the available functions. Examples are included
where necessary to clarify the function use.</p><p>The final section, Extending and Embedding Python, is divided
up much like the previous section. Examples include Enabling
Optional Modules, Converting Data from Python to C and Error
Handling. Sprinkled with the needed tables and code examples,
coverage seems very complete.</p><p>I would highly recommend this book as a reference for any
Python programmer, and a good place to start for an experienced
programmer who is new to Python.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Quick Python Book</em></span> is a totally
different animal. I don't mean that in a bad way&mdash;the intended
audience is just much different. To give you the basic idea, on
page 29 we see the start of Chapter 4, the Quick Python overview.
In the next chapter, we see the introduction of indentation and
block structuring. Finally, by page 90 we see control flow
statements introduced.</p><p>In those first 90 pages, the reader has been encouraged to
type in code fragments at the Python prompt and see what happens.
This gives very positive feedback, the kind a non-professional
programmer will surely need as he is learning the language.</p><p>A lot of time was put into not just teaching a language but
also showing how it interacts with the operating system and what
one can do with it. For example, Chapter 25 is titled &ldquo;HTML and
Python&rdquo;. The chapter is filled with web page examples, showing how
to create the HTML from Python. For those very serious about the
Web, there is even a chapter on using Zope.</p><p>Finally, the appendix is titled &ldquo;The Quick Python
reference&rdquo;. It has much less detail the equivalent information in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Essential Reference</em></span>, but it does
complement the tutorial information nicely.</p><p>This is another good book. I highly recommend it for the
beginning and intermediate Python audience. It is the best book I
have seen for getting beginners up to speed.</p><p>The third book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming with Python</em></span>,
is again very different. Rather than being a tutorial or a
reference, it is a book of examples. The examples take the form of
scripts that are either openly available or were donated to the
book.</p><p>At first, I thought I would like the idea. After spending
some time with the book, I decided I don't like it. After a few (or
a few dozen) scripts followed by an explanation of how they work, I
got bored. Some of the scripts are cute, and many offer reasonable
examples, but I just don't see it as a good learning tool. After
all, with the amount of open-source code out on the Internet, why
buy a book that shows what someone else has selected as
interesting?</p><p>My recommendation is that if you want to see a lot of Python
code, go out to the python.org web site and start looking around.
You are more likely to find what you want, and you can save $39.99
in the process.</p><p>Phil Hughes is the publisher of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. He can be
