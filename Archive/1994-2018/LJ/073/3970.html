    Don't be afraid of large joins&mdash;learn to generate complex
    SQL queries from easy-to-use interfaces.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf42580.0x103a660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few years increasing
numbers of web sites have begun to integrate a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Databases excel at storing and
retrieving information quickly and easily and make it possible for
web developers to create sophisticated applications without getting
bogged down in the details.
</p><p>While it is not hard to integrate a database into a web site,
it can sometimes be tricky to design the database tables, as well
as construct sophisticated applications to use them.</p><p>Last month we looked at (normalization) the technique that
makes it possible to reduce potential errors while increasing the
speed and flexibility of our database. This makes it easier to
create a variety of applications with the same data. This comes at
a price: the queries needed to retrieve information from the
database become more complex, often joining data from two, three or
four tables. With a bit of training, however, programmers can
easily overcome their fear of large joins, using them to retrieve
only the information they need.</p><p>Most users are not programmers, and it is unrealistic to
expect them to construct complex queries on their own. The trick is
to create a user interface that makes it possible to answer a large
subset of the possible questions, without overwhelming users with a
variety of options.</p><p>This month, we will spend some time looking at how to
generate complex SQL queries from relatively easy-to-use
interfaces. Our examples will draw on the example tables from last
month, which describe the Israeli train system.</p><p>In the end, we will write two types of programs. Some
programs (often known as &ldquo;query generators&rdquo; in the database
trade) will generate HTML forms that can be used to create queries.
Other programs will translate the HTML form into an actual SQL
query, displaying the results in the user's browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf42580.0x103a920"></a>Limiting Options</h2></div></div><p>Linux users often sneer at the Macintosh interface, because
it limits the available options. At the bash prompt, a Linux user
can invoke many thousands of commands. Furthermore, the output of
any program can be piped to a file or another program. This
multitude of options makes Linux a particularly powerful system,
yet one that is difficult to learn and master.</p><p>Most users are not interested in power, but simply want to
get their work done. Giving users too much flexibility can
sometimes be a hindrance. In such cases, we want to limit users'
options, forcing them to make a choice that our programs can
handle. This is one of the key advantages of a GUI, it reduces the
chance for user error by reducing the number of available options.
It also reduces the number of potential inputs a program might
receive, making it easier to test applications.</p><p>For example, consider an HTML form that asks users to enter
their destination train station. Many HTML forms use a text area to
input such information as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;input type="text" name="destination" size="30"&gt;
</pre><p>Allowing users to enter a station name in this way opens
Pandora's box, forcing the program to handle misspellings,
capitalization issues and even problems stemming from whitespace.
Databases might be good at many things, but they do require precise
inputs that match exactly.
</p><p>We can improve the situation and simplify our program by
limiting the user's actions with a &lt;select&gt; list. Each
&lt;option&gt; in this &lt;select&gt; list will correspond to one
row from the RailStations table, with the <b  >value</b>
attribute set to the row's &ldquo;ID&rdquo; and the user-visible text set to
the <b  >name</b> attribute. For example, we could do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="destination"&gt;
&lt;option value="1"&gt;Nahariya
&lt;option value="2"&gt;Akko
&lt;option value="3"&gt;Hof Hacarmel
&lt;option value="4"&gt;Tel Aviv Central
&lt;option value="5"&gt;Tel Aviv Hashalom
&lt;option value="6"&gt;Lod
&lt;option value="7"&gt;Rehovot
&lt;option value="8"&gt;Herzliya
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre><p>The above &lt;select&gt; list provides more reliable input
than a text field. However, it presents several problems. First and
foremost, placing the above static HTML in a file means the
RailStations table and the &lt;select&gt; list will inevitably go
out of synch. From the user's perspective, the above &lt;select&gt;
list is difficult to use, because it orders the items according to
their ID numbers rather than their station names.
</p><p>We can solve both of these problems with our query generator,
a CGI program that produces HTML forms based on information in the
database. Listing 1 (see Resources) contains a simple non-CGI
program,
<span   class="bold"><b>select-list-from-table.pl</b></span>, that
produces the above &lt;select&gt; list based on the current
contents of the RailStations table with the stations listed in
alphabetical order. If a train station's name is changed or a new
station is added, an HTML form created by select-list-from-table.pl
will immediately reflect the new value.</p><p>Because rows returned by a <b  >SELECT</b>
statement can be returned in any order specified by the
<b  >ORDER BY</b> clause, it is possible to produce a
&lt;select&gt; list in an order other than alphabetical. For
example, users might prefer to see a list of train stations by
location.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf42580.0x103aef8"></a>Leaving Options Open</h2></div></div><p>The &lt;select&gt; list produced by Listing 1 has at least
one problem. What if the user doesn't care about the particular
piece of information in the &lt;select&gt; list? For example,
assume the user is interested in traveling from Tel Aviv to Rehovot
at some point during the day, but has not yet decided when. Forcing
a user to choose a time from a &lt;select&gt; list makes things
more difficult than they should be. It would be nice to have an
&ldquo;any&rdquo; option on each &lt;select&gt; list, allowing users to
indicate this particular field can have any information.</p><p>Implementing this strategy requires two things. First, one
&lt;option&gt; value can be guaranteed not to correspond to an
existing row's primary key. Second, the CGI program creating the
final query will identify this value and modify the SQL
accordingly.</p><p>Luckily, the combination of MySQL and Perl works quite well
in this context. MySQL's auto-incrementing primary keys begin with
1 and increase until the maximum value is reached. Because an
auto-incrementing primary key can never be zero, we can create an
additional &lt;option&gt; line in the &lt;select&gt; list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;option value="0" selected&gt;Any
</pre><p>By making this value 0, we ensure it cannot correspond to any
actual row's primary key. And by marking it &ldquo;selected&rdquo;, we set
this to be the default value for the &lt;select&gt; menu. New
visitors to the site who accept the default values will thus get
the widest possible search, with the fewest possible
<b  >WHERE</b> clauses. Each selection of an
&lt;option&gt; with a non-zero value will add a new
<b  >WHERE</b> clause to the resulting SQL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf42580.0x103b210"></a>Constructing Basic Queries</h2></div></div><p>The following query lists all times at which trains from
Nahariya (ID 1) have an endpoint of Tel Aviv (ID 5):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT S.name, DT.departure_time
FROM RailStations S, DepartureTimes DT, Trains T,
     StationLines SL
   WHERE T.id = DT.train_id
      AND T.line_id = SL.line_id
      AND S.id = 1
      AND SL.station_id = DT.station_id
      AND DT.station_id = S.id
      AND T.destination_id = 5
   ORDER BY DT.departure_time
;
</pre><p>We can turn the above query into a CGI program by replacing
the two ID numbers with placeholder values. If we fill in the
placeholders with the contents of the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; and &ldquo;endpoint&rdquo;
HTML form elements, we can find the times of all trains from one
station heading toward a particular endpoint. Such a CGI program,
<span   class="bold"><b>list-trains-to-endpoint.pl</b></span>, is in
Listing 2 (see Resources).
</p><p>The above code works just fine until someone selects one of
the <b  >Any</b> items with a value of 0. If that
happens, MySQL will not return any rows from the
<b  >SELECT</b>, because no stations have an ID of 0. The
solution is to make those parts of the query conditional, inserting
them only if an actual value was indicated.</p><p>We accomplish this by placing two &ldquo;if&rdquo; statements in the
middle of the code that assembles the SQL statement. Because the
generic ID is 0, our program can test for a set value simply by
putting the variable name inside parentheses, which implies a test
for non-zero values:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql = "SELECT S.name, DT.departure_time ";
$sql .= "FROM RailStations S, DepartureTimes DT, Trains T, StationLines SL ";
$sql .= "  WHERE T.id = DT.train_id ";
$sql .= "   AND T.line_id = SL.line_id ";
if ($origin)
{
$sql .= "   AND S.id = ? ";
push @placeholders, $origin;
}
$sql .= "   AND SL.station_id = DT.station_id ";
$sql .= "   AND DT.station_id = S.id ";
if ($endpoint)
{
$sql .= "   AND T.destination_id = ? ";
push @placeholders, $endpoint;
}
$sql .= " ORDER BY DT.departure_time ";
</pre><p>Listing 3 (see Resources) contains a program,
<span   class="bold"><b>better-list-trains-to-endpoint.pl</b></span>,
that allows users to specify a station of origin, an endpoint for
the train, neither or both. If the user specifies only the station
of origin, the program will display a list of trains departing from
that station without regard for direction. If the user specifies
only the endpoint, it will list all departures toward that station.
Most applications do not need to give such headway to users, and
might want to trap inputs in which both elements are assigned
values of 0. At the same time, no harm comes from allowing users to
amuse themselves with nonsensical queries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf42580.0x103b688"></a>When Does the Train Leave?</h2></div></div><p>The above queries work just fine, yet they ignore a crucial
issue when working with train schedules: people typically want to
specify the time they prefer to leave or arrive. It would certainly
be possible to give users a set of &lt;select&gt; lists
corresponding to various hours and minutes in the day, giving them
fine control over the assembled query. We could also allow them to
enter dates and times in text fields, but as with station names,
there are too many possible ways for such input to go wrong.</p><p>It is probably easier for them to relate to time information
such as &ldquo;morning&rdquo;, &ldquo;afternoon&rdquo; and &ldquo;night&rdquo;, rather than
specifying hours. We can do this by using another set of
&lt;select&gt; lists, this time specifying hours as values and by
setting the hours to the end of the specified period. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="time"&gt;
&lt;option value="12:00"&gt;Morning
&lt;option value="17:00"&gt;Afternoon
&lt;option value="21:00"&gt;Evening
&lt;option value="24:00"&gt;Night
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre><p>We can find all morning trains by asking for those earlier
than 12:00, afternoon trains by asking for those before 17:00 and
so forth.
</p><p>With such a &lt;select&gt; list in place in the query
generator form, we can rest assured that users will be able to find
their train. If we are concerned that too many trains will match
their query, we can add another &lt;select&gt; list to the HTML
form, allowing users to limit the number of returned trains. MySQL
supports a <b  >LIMIT</b> clause on
<b  >SELECT</b> queries, making it possible to return a
maximum number of rows.</p><p>Note that <b  >LIMIT</b> will always contain a
numeric value and can thus be inserted directly into the SQL query
without the use of placeholders. Indeed, trying to use placeholders
in a <b  >LIMIT</b> clause will force the number to be
quoted, which will cause a MySQL error.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>best-list-trains.pl</b></span>, a
program that implements both of these ideas&mdash;the &ldquo;time&rdquo; element
and a &ldquo;limit&rdquo; element&mdash;is in Listing 4 (see Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf42580.0x103bb58"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>While it is tempting to give users infinite freedom to enter
information into a web site, it is usually best to limit their
inputs as much as possible. Creating simple HTML-based query
generators is not difficult and can even be easy once you get the
hang of it. The trick is to formulate queries in such a way that
the user can get the maximum information while knowing as little as
possible about the underlying database. Even when the queries are
easy to create, finding ways to turn those queries into language
suitable for non-programmers can be a challenge.</p><p><a href="3970s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
