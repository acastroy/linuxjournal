    With the exploding popularity of this clean, robust language, we
    decided it was time to provide our readers with a supplement dedicated
    to Python.

employees have been fans of Python for some time. Many of the
scripts we use daily are written in Python. Our publisher, Phil
Hughes, likes it so much he reads every Python book published. (He
reviews three of them in this supplement.) Combining that fact with
the exploding popularity of this clean, robust language, we decided
it was time to provide our readers with a supplement dedicated to
Python.
</p><p>Wait, what's this? A bridge and its keeper wanting us to
answer three questions before continuing. Well, I'll go first&mdash;how
hard can they be? You follow.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wha-at! is your
name?</b></span> Marjorie of Richardson</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Whe-re! are you
from?</b></span> Seattle in Washington</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Wha-at! is your favorite
programming language?</b></span> FORTRAN&mdash;No! Python&mdash;Too late!
Aaaaaaah!</p></li></ol></div><p>Those easy ones get me every time, but I'm sure you will do
better. Give it a try and if you miss any, consider yourself thrown
into the ravine with me.
</p><p>The answer to number three should, of course, be Python. If
something else, you might not want to continue unless you are
actually searching for that holiest of grails&mdash;the perfect
scripting language. The worst and <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
complaint I've heard about Python is the required tabs, and
everyone gets used to those in fairly short order. After all, most
programmers use them anyway to ensure a readable format for their
code. On the other hand, it's easy to learn, easy to write, easy to
understand&mdash;in other words, perfect!</p><p>We have plenty for you to enjoy this month: programming
articles, book reviews and articles by Guido van Rossum and Eric
Raymond. Guido tells us how he envisions Python will be used in the
future to teach programming in schools. Eric tells us why Python is
now his favorite language (he made it across the bridge!) and why
he uses it instead of Perl in much of his programming. And don't
forget, the <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s focus this month
is Programming, and there's a great article in the main issue about
embedding Python in multi-threaded C/C++ programs&mdash;not to be
missed. There are even two Python articles in &ldquo;Strictly On-line&rdquo;
at
<a href="http://linuxjournal.com" target="_self">http://linuxjournal.com/</a>.</p><p>Just in case you're wondering about all the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>silliness</em></span>, Guido van Rossum, the creator of
Python, is a big fan of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Monty Python</em></span>
series and named the language after it. Thanks to Jason Schumaker
for posing as a nude hacker for our Pythonesque cover. So, those of
you who made it across the bridge can now proceed in learning more
about this wonderful &ldquo;Monty Python&rdquo; of programming languages.
That is, don't run away&mdash;stay and have fun (nudge nudge, wink
wink). We promise not to make any dead parrot jokes...</p><p>  --Marjorie Richardson, who expects to wield supreme
executive power even though a watery tart didn't throw a sword at
her.</p></div></div>
