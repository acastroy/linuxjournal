    Some of the ongoing shifts in the Python community were
    apparent at the Eighth International Python Conference
    (IPC8), held in Washington, DC this past January.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0e580.0x1e06240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Some of the ongoing shifts in the Python
community were apparent at the Eighth International Python
Conference (IPC8), held in Washington, DC this past January. [Note:
the Spanish Inquisition was not in attendence.] For a start, the
continued growth of the Python community was obvious. IPC7, the
previous conference, attracted roughly a hundred attendees. IPC8
was more than twice as large, with around 250 attendees. Much of
this growth came from the increasing popularity of the Zope
application server, which had its own conference track for the
first time. This track drew some 90 people who attended talks on
Zope's architecture and features, designing applications for Zope,
and saw demos of new products such as the Portal Toolkit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0e580.0x1e06348"></a>Education</h2></div></div><p>One interesting new theme emerged at this conference, the
idea of using Python to teach programming.</p><p>Randy Pausch of Carnegie-Mellon University gave a keynote
talk about the Alice virtual reality system
(<a href="http://www.alice.org" target="_self">http://www.alice.org/</a>),
a stunning talk that held out some hope that maybe, just maybe,
these computer things can be useful to people without requiring
them to master Cartesian coordinates or to adjust their thinking to
match the machine's. Alice is a 3D VR system used in a course at
CMU, whose audience is non-technical users without a background in
engineering or computer science. Accordingly, the system has been
carefully tested for usability throughout its development. Python
had to be modified slightly to improve its suitability for novices,
but only two serious changes were made: floating point is
automatically used for all numbers in Alice, and the language was
made case-insensitive so that names such as &ldquo;Value&rdquo; and &ldquo;value&rdquo;
refer to the same variable. The talk concluded with an impressive
video of four different projects done using Alice, ranging from a
&ldquo;Calvin and Hobbes&rdquo;-inspired sled ride to computer-generated
characters who follow a human aerobics instructor.</p><p>Unfortunately, Alice is available only for Windows, although
a Playstation port is being worked on, and the resulting structural
changes should also provide for a MacOS port. In answer to an
audience member's question about using Alice on the Macintosh,
Pausch replied that you'd have to purchase VirtualPC for the
Macintosh; Alice is efficient enough to run acceptably under
emulation. Therefore, instead of waiting for a Linux port, you
should probably just buy VMware and a copy of Windows. Alice is
exciting enough to be worth it!</p><p>Guido van Rossum's nascent &ldquo;Computer Programming for
Everybody&rdquo; project aims to use Python for teaching by creating a
sophisticated programming environment that helps out novices,
writing a CS curriculum and perhaps modifying the Python language
to make it easier to learn. At the moment, Van Rossum is gearing up
to start work on CP4E, thinking about incremental parsing and type
inferencing&mdash;and deciding what to teach in one semester. Van Rossum
would like a spell-checker-style mode of operation for the teaching
environment, so that as soon as one types a line of code, it would
be checked and any possible problems noted.</p><p>A birds-of-a-feather session on education had 40 attendees
and led to the creation of an Education SIG that will continue to
discuss and develop teaching aids for Python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0e580.0x1e06608"></a>Scientific Programming</h2></div></div><p>Over the last five years, an increasing number of people have
begun using Python for numeric work. The canonical story told in
scientific programming papers at Python conferences usually runs
something like this: a group has an existing body of numeric
routines, usually written in Fortran or C/C++. To speed up
prototyping, the group decides to write a scripting language that
gives them an interpreted environment to experiment in. However,
along the way, someone discovers Python, and rather than re-invent
the wheel and maintain their own interpreter, they realize it's
much easier just to write a Python interface to the
number-crunching code.</p><p>Python's suitability for numeric work stems from three main
reasons. First are the excellent Numeric Python extensions that
provide powerful, multidimensional matrix types.</p><p>The second reason is SWIG, which can parse a C header or
Fortran file and automatically generate a Python wrapper for the C
or Fortran functions. SWIG also supports Perl and Tcl (XXX and
Guile?), but here the third factor comes into play. Python's syntax
is simple and relatively familiar, unlike the shell-influenced
structures of Tcl and Perl, or the parenthesis-heavy Scheme/Lisp
syntax that people either love or loathe.</p><p>An excellent example would be the talk &ldquo;Using Python to
Modernize Astronomical Software&rdquo; by Richard White and Perry
Greenfield. The authors work for the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, which is responsible for processing data
from the Hubble Space Telescope. They use an astronomical software
environment called IRAF, consisting of around a million lines of
code. IRAF provides a portable, though not feature-rich,
environment for writing analysis software, but the command language
isn't very flexible or easy to use. They started down the path of
writing their own new language, then discovered Python and decided
to use it as the new IRAF command language. Because IRAF works by
running subprocesses for each job, Python needs only to be able to
speak IRAF's interprocess protocol in order to fit into the system.
The Python interface, called PyRAF, will soon be going into beta
testing at a few sites, with final release in a few months. It can
also parse and emulate the old command language to provide backward
compatibility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0e580.0x1e06818"></a>Commercialization</h2></div></div><p>The increasing commercial importance of Python was also
visible. Free software generally starts out being experimented with
by a few adventurous users in their spare time, who then quietly
begin using the software for real work. Early adopters often have
to battle reluctant managers who are doubtful about trying an
unfamiliar program, but when the software gains in popularity, the
early adopters are well placed.</p><p>Judging by several announcements, Python is moving smoothly
along this path. The Python Consortium, which provides a way for
companies to fund Python's ongoing development, has grown to two
full-member companies and seven associate members.</p><p>As another example, ActiveState will now be providing
enterprise-class support for Python, as they currently do for Perl.
They've definitely started off on the right foot, joining the
Python Consortium and hiring Mark Hammond and David Ascher. Both
have been part of the Python community for years; Mark Hammond is
the primary author of the Python Windows port and co-author of the
O'Reilly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Programming on Win32</em></span>, and
David Ascher maintained Numeric Python for awhile and co-authored
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning Python</em></span>. Since they've got two highly
skilled developers, I expect to see interesting Python-related
things coming out of ActiveState before too long.</p><p>Several well-known Python developers have formed their own
companies. Fredrik Lundh's SecretLabs AB demonstrated PythonWorks,
their commercial integrated development environment. Neuberger
&amp; Hughes presented WorldPilot, a web-based mail and calendar
application built on top of Zope. Andy Robinson and Aaron Watters
announced the formation of ReportLabs, which will provide
consulting services based on PDFgen, their open-source Python
library for creating PDF documents programmatically. All of these
companies have contributed significant pieces of free software to
the Python community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0e580.0x1e06ad8"></a>Developer's Day</h2></div></div><p>Happily, commercialization hasn't diluted the conference's
strong technical slant. As a few weeks of reading comp.lang.python
will tell you, Python programmers tend to be inveterate language
hackers, curious to explore new programming language ideas and to
apply them to Python. Two fascinating, though challenging, talks
were presented that discussed potential new directions for Python.
John Aycock's &ldquo;Aggressive Type Inference&rdquo; talk described a type
inferencing system for Python, then tested its accuracy by running
it on a number of sizable Python programs such as IDLE, Gadfly and
Grail. This confirmed Aycock's hypothesis that most variables in
Python programs can have a consistent type inferred for them.
Programmers rarely use the same variable name for both a list and
an integer, and such polymorphism is usually confined to a few
sections of code.</p><p>Christian Tismer's &ldquo;Stackless Python&rdquo; presentation was even
more exciting. The current Python interpreter does a C function
recursion for every Python function call, which means you can
recurse only so deeply before filling up the C stack. Tismer
performed some major surgery on the Python interpreter's virtual
machine, allowing implementation of various language features such
as continuations, generators, co-routines and microthreads.
Christian even suggested it would be possible to pickle an entire
interpreter state, ship it to an interpreter on another machine,
unpickle it and resume the thread of execution.</p><p>Another IPC tradition has been Developer's Day, where lively
free-for-all sessions give participants a chance to discuss future
development over a higher-bandwidth medium than a mailing list.
This year, sessions covered such topics such as
internationalization, documentation tools, XML software and
compiler tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0e580.0x1e06c90"></a>Next Year</h2></div></div><p>The conferences have previously alternated between East Coast
and West Coast cities, but the upcoming 9th conference will break
that pattern by being in Washington DC again, in November 2000.
That's quite soon, so start working on papers now!</p><p><a href="3865s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
