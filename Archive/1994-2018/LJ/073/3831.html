Linux books and Windows books, all alike. However, the one area
where Linux is lacking is in certification. Like myself, you may
not believe that certifications are a true measure of ability.
Nonetheless, Linux does have one certification exam in the form of
the Red Hat Certified Engineer program (RHCE). This exam even has a
new book to go with it, Kara J. Pritchard's RHCE Exam Cram.</p><p>The author assumes the reader knows a bit about UNIX in
general and does not go into detail regarding basic skills. Chapter
1 is an introduction to the RHCE-300 exam itself, and Chapter 2 is
an introduction to the history of Linux and free/open source
software. The book includes a self-assessment at the beginning to
determine whether one needs it. If you want a tutorial, this is not
for you. For UNIX users who may not be administrators, Ms.
Pritchard gives a good introduction to basic administration
concepts in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 goes into great detail about the
basics of TCP/IP and related services. Chapter 5 covers the basics
of a Red Hat Linux installation, with which some readers might not
be entirely comfortable, and after a brief interlude of basic
system administration, Chapter 6 immerses the reader in dual-boots,
kickstarts and other wonderful features of the Red Hat Linux
installer. Chapter 8 covers quotas, run levels and the nitty-gritty
of custom kernel compiles, as well as teaching one how to deal with
crontab and profile files.</p><p>Chapter 9 does a wonderful job of showing how to configure
the X Window System from scratch, as well as clueing a user in on
several popular window managers including the GNOME and KDE
environments. Chapter 10 describes how to configure Apache,
Sendmail, FTP, DNS, NFS and Samba, as well as DHCP, Time
Configuration and Squid. I found this section to be the most
informative and useful outside of the realm of Red Hat Linux. I
consulted the Samba section of the chapter when I had to help a
friend configure a home network with Samba, which I had never done
before.</p><p>Chapter 11 shows how to take a newly networked system and
secure it, something every Linux administrator should know,
including the basics of NIS, working with PAM, tcp_wrappers,
routing and firewalls with ipchains.</p><p>Chapters 12 and 13 explain the process of the installation
exam and the debugging exam, with Chapter 14 being a practice test
and Chapter 15 its answer key. I am happy to report that I scored a
47 out of 50 on my first try, thanks to Ms. Pritchard's wonderful
tutorials and test hints.</p><p>This being an exam preparation book, Ms. Pritchard does a
good job of placing sample questions pertinent to each section
throughout the book at the end of each chapter. She also lists
external resources, such as HOWTOs, FAQs and other books on the
subject at the end of each chapter. Every chapter has numerous exam
hints, tips and tricks that are useful when you take your
test.</p><p>Linux certification might not be the best way to ensure
quality and skill of administrators, but it is a step toward
getting Linux accepted in the corporate marketplace. Certification
programs may produce cookie-cutter administrators, yet they will
have very marketable and consistent skills useful not only with
Linux, but with UNIX in general. Ms. Pritchard's book does a great
job of introducing someone to, and preparing them for, the Red Hat
Certified Engineer exam, and hopefully, will lead Linux users to
bigger and more interesting learning experiences.</p></div></div>
