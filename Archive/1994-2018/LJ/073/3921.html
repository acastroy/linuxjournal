    How to program using the Qt windowing system in X.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0xffb3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article describes the implementation
of rtp (real-time plotter), a live x,y data plotting utility based
on the Qt windowing library. <span   class="bold"><b>rtp</b></span>
combines live updates with zoom in, auto-scaling, and auto-tracking
modes. It is meant to be used where
<span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> is limited, such as the
termination of a live data pipeline. However, rtp is small and does
not attempt to cover gnuplot's large feature set for producing
publishable data plots.
</p><p>The rtp source code is released under the GPL and is
available at
<a href="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/science/visualization/rtp-1.0.0.tar.gz" target="_self">metalab.unc.edu/pub/linux/science/visualization/rtp-1.0.0.tar.gz</a>.
I developed and tested it under Red Hat 6.0, with Qt 1.44. A README
file is included in the package to help you build and use rtp. A
screenshot of rtp is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3921f1.large.jpg"><img src="3921f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Rtp Screenshot</p></div></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rtp</b></span> provides real-time
updates and basic mouse-driven resolution selection. However, it
lacks gnuplot's ability to send formatted, titled plots to a
printer. <span   class="bold"><b>rtp</b></span> is still a simple
piece of software (1200 lines of code) that needs many features
added. By describing its principles here, I hope to provide a
useful, gentle example of an application based on the Qt library
and the X Window System. I also hope to motivate some interested
people to do more work on a Linux-based real-time, interactive data
visualization system. This could be done either by extending rtp or
as a completely new project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0xffb978"></a>Viewing Modes</h2></div></div><p>Because all of rtp's data comes from STDIN (standard input),
interaction with the user through the X Window System is limited to
setting the viewing mode. It allows the user to change the viewing
mode even as new data points are being processed. The viewing modes
are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Auto scale: the scaling is adjusted when necessary
to include all received data points. This is the default mode and
can be selected by pressing a button on the toolbar.</p></li><li><p>Auto tracking: maintains a fixed scaling, but
varies the viewport offset to track the latest points. This mode is
selected by pressing a button on the toolbar. The scaling will be
fixed at what it was before the toolbar button was pressed.</p></li><li><p>User-defined fixed: maintains a fixed viewport
(both scale and offset), as defined by the user. This mode is
selected when the user drags out a viewport in the plot window with
the mouse.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0xffbce8"></a>Qt Library</h2></div></div><p>I based rtp on the Qt library, because many others in the
Linux community are using it (e.g., KDE) and because of its
high-quality documentation. An HTML tree (guaranteed to be
synchronized with the Qt source because it is automatically
generated from the source code and comments) describes all of Qt's
classes and functions. Dalheimer also wrote a book on Qt
programming that is a very helpful introduction (see
Resources).</p><p>The Qt library provides a GUI programming environment that is
quite complete. When programming in the Qt environment, no
reference to the underlying XLib library is necessary. Qt's
functionality extends beyond the GUI domain to include container
classes that implement several standard data structures.</p><p>Each of Qt's functional components is packaged as a C++
class, giving C++ wizards much to ponder and tinker with and those
of us who like to write operational code a good tool set. For
myself, having about a year of experience writing production C code
with only a college course in C++, it was fairly easy to learn the
Qt C++ framework.</p><p>The Qt library makes integration of independently developed
classes easier through its C++ extensions: &ldquo;signals&rdquo; and
&ldquo;slots&rdquo;. A signal is a class member function that is undefined at
compile time. A slot is a member function that is specially
designated for connection to a signal at runtime. For example, a
GUI button class could have a <span   class="bold"><b>Push</b></span>
signal. At runtime, a plot window's slot
<span   class="bold"><b>Render</b></span> could be connected to the
button's <span   class="bold"><b>Push</b></span>. From then on, code
that calls the button's <span   class="bold"><b>Push</b></span>
method effectively calls the plot window's
<span   class="bold"><b>Render</b></span> method.</p><p>Code based on the signals and slots mechanism is easier to
read and maintain than that dealing with runtime function-pointer
tables. (I'd bet the implementation uses a function pointer or
two.) Qt also takes care of annoyances such as stubbing
non-connected signals to an empty function, so you don't get a
segmentation fault from a null pointer.</p><p>The drawback of signals and slots is that they are
non-standard C++ extensions using new syntax, so Qt code with
signals and slots must be passed through a preprocessor provided
with the Qt library before it can be compiled. Dalheimer's book
explains signals and slots in sufficient detail for you to start
using them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0xffc160"></a>Architectural Requirements</h2></div></div><p>In order to provide an acceptable user interface, rtp must
quickly respond to GUI events (i.e., mouse events, etc.) at all
times. This requirement would be easily met if all program activity
were directed by GUI events. For example, an interactive drawing
program is entirely GUI-driven, so its only responsibility is to
execute relatively short sequences of code in response to GUI
events.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rtp</b></span>'s architecture is
complicated by two additional requirements, beyond the snappy GUI
response. It must quickly update when new data points are available
on STDIN. This feature is what differentiates rtp from other plot
programs, such as gnuplot. It must also deal with the fact that
rendering the data set often takes more time than is acceptable for
a GUI delay. This precludes the use of a simple function call to
render the whole plot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0xffc318"></a>Multiplexing Tasks</h2></div></div><p>Fundamentally, there are three &ldquo;tasks&rdquo; that rtp must
multiplex, listed below from highest to lowest priority:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Respond quickly to GUI events. These events come as
data from the X server on a socket.</p></li><li><p>Read data points from STDIN as they become
available.</p></li><li><p>Render the data set into the plot window when it
needs updating.</p></li></ol></div><p>The Qt library provides mechanisms that support this
processing structure. The first mechanism is the QSocketNotifier
class. When we create a QSocketNotifier object, we pass it the file
descriptor of interest. (The fancy name QSocketNotifier made me
think the class was all tied in with network sockets, when in
reality it can work with most any file descriptor.) In the case of
rtp, this is the STDIN file descriptor
(<b  >STDIN_FILENO</b>). We then connect
QSocketNotifier's <b  >activated</b> signal to a
particular slot that deals with new data.
</p><p>The second mechanism is the QTimer class. This class is
provided to support regularly scheduled background processing, as
well as single-shot timed events. The Qt documentation tells us
that by setting up a QTimer object with zero timeout, we can cause
a function to be called whenever there are no events to process.
Again, the mechanisms for connecting the QTimer to the actual
function that does the background processing are signals and
slots.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3921f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. rtp Control Flow and Data Processing
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0xffc9a0"></a>Components</h2></div></div><p>Figure 2 illustrates rtp's control flow and data processing
scheme. The Qt event loop is the control center for the
application. It calls functions in the rtp application as events
occur. Each arrow in the diagram represents a call into a function
or library. Note that only the functions which have names starting
with <span   class="bold"><b>PlotWindow</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender</b></span> are actual rtp code. The
rtp functions consist of X event callbacks (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>PlotWindow::paintEvent</b></span> and
friends), the QSocketNotifier callback
(<span   class="bold"><b>PlotWindow::slotStdinAwake</b></span>) and
the QTimer callback
(<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile</b></span>).</p><p>XLib is the lowest-level C library provided as an interface
to an X server across a byte-stream socket. It manages both the
input side of the socket, which provides events, and the output
side which sends requests to the server. (Note that Figure 2 shows
only the input side.) XLib also provides certain performance
optimizations, such as filtering redundant events and delaying
requests in an internal queue in order to group requests in large
data blocks for efficient socket usage. For details, see Adrian
Nye's classic XLib book in Resources.</p><p>The POSIX <span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> system call
is commonly used by applications that service more than one file
descriptor (socket) in a single thread.
<span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> is used by applications,
such as rtp, that must respond to data on any of several file
descriptors and do not wish to waste CPU time by polling.
Additionally, Qt uses select's timeout function to start
QTimer-scheduled functions.</p><p>The select call in the Qt library is the only place (to my
knowledge) where the rtp process can block. For newcomers to
systems programming, I should explain what &ldquo;blocking&rdquo; means. A
multitasking operating system such as Linux must be able to
multiplex the execution of a large number of programs on a smaller
number of processors. By trapping interrupts, Linux switches the
processor(s) among running programs in a certain order. This makes
it impossible for a single program to lock the system by entering
an infinite loop.</p><p>Because Linux has pre-emptive multitasking, rtp could enter
an infinite loop waiting for either an X event or a data point on
STDIN without locking the system. However, the CPU time spent in
this loop would unnecessarily degrade the performance of the rest
of the executing programs. Therefore, most calls into the kernel
for I/O will &ldquo;block&rdquo; the executing program until the I/O is
complete. The program will be removed from the set of programs run
by the CPU. Once the I/O is done, the program is marked as
&ldquo;runnable&rdquo; and will re-enter the kernel's run queue to be
switched in and out of the CPU along with other runnable
programs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> is Qt's way of
saying, &ldquo;I have nothing to do until an X event is available, an
I/O event occurs on one of the QSocketNotifier objects, or a
timeout from one of the <b  >QTimer</b> objects
expires.&rdquo; From Qt's point of view, select waits for one of these
events to occur, then returns.</p><p>The Qt documentation clearly describes how to use
QSocketNotifier and QTimer to hook into select. However, it does
not fully describe the priority levels of X events vs. other socket
events vs. timer events. In writing a program such as rtp, it is
important to understand these details, because the program's
performance greatly depends on them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0x13f5220"></a>Inside Qt's Event Handling</h2></div></div><p>In order to understand how the X socket, other sockets and
timers are prioritized, we have to look into the Qt source. Troll
makes the Qt source freely available (see Resources for the URL).
The code we want is in /src/kernel/qapplication_x11.cpp, under the
distribution tree. Note that while Qt source is freely
redistributable, Troll's license prohibits modification, unlike the
GPL.</p><p>The function
<span   class="bold"><b>QApplication::processNextEvent</b></span>,
which is called by the main event loop, services the X socket,
QSocketNotifier sockets and QTimer timers.
QApplication::processNextEvent first checks for an X event to
process. If none is found, it enters the select system call.</p><p>After select returns, QApplication::processNextEvent
dispatches events to all QSocketNotifier objects whose file
descriptors are ready. It then dispatches events to all QTimers
whose timeouts have been reached. The event loop for Qt 1.44 can be
summarized as follows (fd stands for file descriptor):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (1)
{
   if (X event pending) {
      dispatch X event;
      continue;
   }
      timeout = minimum of all QTimer times to
         next event;
      select (X fd, all QSocketNotifier fd's,
         timeout);
      dispatch events to all QSocketNotifier's with
        active sockets;
      dispatch events to all QTimer's with expired
         times;
}
</pre><p>Note that X events get highest priority, in the sense that as
long as there are more X events, the loop will ignore the
QSocketNotifier's and QTimer's events. However, when an X event is
not available, it is possible that Qt will execute
<span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> QSocketNotifier and QTimer event before
returning to X events. This means we must consider the sum of
registered QSocketNotifier and QTimer event processing times as the
worst-case user interface latency.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0x13f5538"></a>Data Structures</h2></div></div><p>From here on, I will refer to the rtp code in some detail.
You may want to download the code from the URL given earlier and
print it out with line numbers.</p><p>All of rtp's non-automatic data structures are embedded
within two primary C++ classes.
<span   class="bold"><b>PlotWindow</b></span> is derived from Qt's
QWidget and provides all user interface callbacks, as well as the
STDIN callback. These classes are laid out in rtp.h. The important
data members of PlotWindow are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >deque&lt;DoubPt&gt; _points</b>: the
entire set of raw (x,y) data points received from stdin.
<span   class="bold"><b>deque</b></span> is a C++ Standard Template
Library class that (among other things) gives the illusion of
contiguous memory layout (array indices, fake pointers that you can
increment to move through the deque) to a dynamically sized
block-linked data structure. Points are kept in the order in which
they are received.</p></li><li><p><b  >QPixmap *_buffer</b>: the pixmap
that is copied into the plot window whenever the window is
painted.</p></li><li><p><b  >RtpMapping _map</b>: holds the
viewport boundaries, scale factors and offsets currently in effect
for mapping received data points into the plot window.</p></li><li><p><b  >QRect *_rubberBox</b>: if non-NULL,
defines the &ldquo;rubber&rdquo; box that the user is bounding with the mouse
to define a new viewport. Once the user releases the mouse, the box
will be deleted from the screen and the viewport will
change.</p></li></ul></div><p>The other important rtp class is
<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender</b></span>. Its important data
members are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >QTimer _timer</b>: activated to call
<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile</b></span> while a
rendering is in progress. Inactive when rendering is not in
progress.</p></li><li><p><b  >unsigned int _pti</b>: marks the
position in points as successive calls to RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile
progress through the data.</p></li><li><p><b  >QPixMap *_privateBuff</b>:
<b  >*_buf. _privateBuff</b> will be created for a
private rendering (explained below). <b  >_buf</b> is the
pixmap actually drawn into by RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile. It will
equal either <b  >_privateBuff</b> for a private
rendering or the main repaint pixmap for an on-line
rendering.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0x13f6140"></a>How rtp Processes Data Points</h2></div></div><p>Data points to plot come in on STDIN. As part of its initial
setup, rtp sets the STDIN file descriptor mode to non-blocking so
that any read of STDIN will not block the program. This allows us
to read stdin in relatively large chunks, increasing efficiency.
<span   class="bold"><b>rtp</b></span> then creates a QSocketNotifier
for STDIN, registering PlotWindow::slotStdinAwake as the callback
through the signal/slot mechanism. Here is the code, from line 454
of rtp.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fcntl(STDIN_FILENO, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
QSocketNotifier sn(STDIN_FILENO,
  QSocketNotifier::Read);
QObject::connect(&amp;sn, SIGNAL(activated(int)),
  plotter, SLOT(slotStdinAwake()));
</pre><p>When <span   class="bold"><b>slotStdinAwake</b></span> (rtp.c,
line 100) is called, we know there is at least one character of
data on STDIN (because select returned with STDIN marked as ready,
and all POSIX I/O is character-based). However, simply reading one
character and then returning is very inefficient. For optimal
efficiency, we want to read and process as many characters as
possible.
</p><p>However, the time spent in slotStdinAwake contributes to the
user interface latency, because no X events can be processed until
slotStdinAwake exits. If we processed as many STDIN characters as
were available and STDIN was receiving points at a faster rate than
they could be processed, we could risk locking out the UI (user
interface) completely. So we have a classic tradeoff between
efficiency and latency. The current version of rtp attempts to read
and process 1024 characters of data per slotStdinAwake call.
However, because the <span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span> call
doesn't block, we may not actually process this many
characters.</p><p>slotStdinAwake is uglified by the fact that it does its own
buffering and doesn't use the STDIO library. I couldn't tell from
the GNU libc information whether STDIO would work after
<b  >O_NONBLOCK</b> had been set on the descriptor.
Rather than find out, I took the lazy approach and wrote my own
buffering code.</p><p><a href="3921l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>When rtp parses a new x,y data point, it will map it into the
current pixmap if it is within the current viewport's range. If the
point is out of range and the plot mode is auto-scale or
auto-tracking, the entire plot must be redrawn at a new scaling and
offset. The code in Listing 1 (rtp.c, line 255) handles these
cases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf03580.0x13f6610"></a>How Rtp Renders the Set of Data Points</h2></div></div><p><a href="3921l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>The class <span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender</b></span> (defined
in rtpRender.c) handles the details of drawing the set of data
points into a pixmap. Because rendering the entire set can take
significant time, RtpRender sets up a QTimer object with zero
timeout to give all available CPU time to rendering while
maintaining snappy UI response.
<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile</b></span>, the
QTimer callback, munches on points for a fixed interval (100 msec
at present), and then returns. The code in Listing 2 is the guts of
RtpRender::slotWorkAwhile (rtpRender.c, line 274).</p><p><a href="3921l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>There are two types of rendering operations. A pre-emptive or
on-line rendering draws points directly into the pixmap used for
repaint events. A new on-line rendering is started by calling
<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender::newOnlineRender</b></span>. When
this is called, any rendering that may be in progress is cancelled
and the new rendering starts from scratch, drawing all received
points. The code is in Listing 3 (rtpRender.c, line 77).</p><p>When RtpRender::newOnlineRender is called, a pointer to the
pixmap used for repaint is passed in as the <b  >buf</b>
argument. <b  >_map</b> is a data structure that contains
the scale and offset factors for the new rendering and is returned
to the calling code, so that new points from STDIN can be directly
plotted even as the rendering progresses.</p><p>A non-preemptive or private rendering first creates a private
pixmap, then draws the points into it. A private rendering is
requested by calling
<span   class="bold"><b>RtpRender::quePrivateRender</b></span>. The
private rendering does not cancel the current rendering operation
if one is in progress. It waits until the current rendering is
complete before starting. The code is in Listing 4 (rtpRender.c,
line 97).</p><p><a href="3921l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Because the queuing mechanism is just a boolean flag, the
private rendering queue is only one deep. When
RtpRender::quePrivateRender is called, it will destroy any pending
private rendering operation, but will not interfere with one
already in progress. Note that <b  >_timer</b> is an
object of type QTimer. If the timer is already active, it means a
rendering is already in progress.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>rtp</b></span> uses private rendering
to update the plot when new data points force a viewport change in
either the auto-scale or auto-tracking mode. On-line rendering is
used to update the plot in response to user-initiated viewport
changes, such as zooming into a moused region. The theory is new
points come in quickly enough that we don't want to start over each
time we get one. However, when the user changes the viewport, he
has no interest in anything but the latest and greatest
plot.</p><p><a href="3921s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
