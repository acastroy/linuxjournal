    Python provides a clean intuitive interface to complex,
    threaded applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b005b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Developers often make use of high-level
scripting languages as a way of quickly writing flexible code.
Various shell scripting languages have long been used to automate
processes on UNIX systems. More recently, software applications
have begun to provide scripting layers that allow the user to
automate common tasks or even extend the feature set. Think of all
the well-known applications you use: GIMP, Emacs, Word, Photoshop,
etc. It seems as though all can be scripted in some way.
</p><p>In this article, I will describe how you can embed the Python
language within your C applications. There are many reasons you
would want to do this. For instance, you may want to provide your
more advanced users with the ability to alter or customize the
program. Or maybe you want to take advantage of a Python
capability, rather than implement it yourself. Python is a good
choice for this task because it provides a clean, intuitive C API.
Since many complex applications are written using threads, I will
also show you how to create a thread-safe interface to the Python
interpreter.</p><p>All the examples assume you are using Python version 1.5.2,
which comes pre-installed on most recent Linux distributions. The
API to access the Python interpreter is the same for both C and
C++. There are no special C++ constructs used, and all functions
are declared extern &ldquo;C&rdquo;. For this reason, the concepts described
and the example code given here should work equally well when using
either C or C++.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b00768"></a>Overview of the Python C/C++ API</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways that C and Python code can work together
within the same process. Simply put, Python code can call C code or
C code can call Python code. These two methods are called
&ldquo;extending&rdquo; and &ldquo;embedding&rdquo;, respectively. When extending, you
create a new Python module implemented in C/C++. This allows you to
provide new functionality to the Python language that cannot be
implemented in Python. For instance, several core Python modules
such as &ldquo;time&rdquo; and &ldquo;nis&rdquo; are implemented as C extensions, while
others are written in Python. You never notice the difference
between C and Python modules, because the act of importing and
using these modules is the same. If you look around in your
/usr/lib/python1.5 directory, you may see some shared library files
(extension .so). These are Python module extensions written in C.
You will also see various Python files (extension .py) which are
modules written in Python.</p><p>Typically, when you embed Python, you will develop a C/C++
application that has the ability to load and execute Python
scripts. The application will be linked against the Python
interpreter library, called libpython1.5.a, which provides all
functionality related to evaluating Python code. There is no Python
executable involved, only an API for your application to
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b008c8"></a>Embedded Python</h2></div></div><p><a href="3641l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Embedding Python is a relatively straightforward process. If
your goal is merely to execute vanilla Python code from within a C
program, it's actually quite easy. Listing 1 is the complete source
to a program that embeds the Python interpreter. This illustrates
one of the simplest programs you could write making use of the
Python interpreter.</p><p>Listing 1 uses three Python-specific function calls.
<span   class="bold"><b>Py_Initialize</b></span> starts up the Python
interpreter library, causing it to allocate whatever internal
resources it needs. You must call this function before calling most
other functions in the Python API.
<span   class="bold"><b>PyEval_SimpleString</b></span> provides a
quick, no-frills way to execute arbitrary Python code.
Interpretation of the code is immediate. In the above example, for
instance, the <b  >import&nbsp;sys</b> line causes Python
to import the <span   class="bold"><b>sys</b></span> module before
returning control to the C/C++ program. Each string passed to
PyEval_SimpleString must be a complete Python statement of some
kind. In other words, half statements are illegal, even if they are
completed with another call to PyRun_SimpleString. For example, the
following code will not work properly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
// Python will print first error here
PyRun_SimpleString("import ");&lt;\n&gt;
// Python will print second error here
PyRun_SimpleString("sys\n");&lt;\n&gt;
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>Py_Finalize</b></span> is the last
Python function which any application that embeds Python must call.
This function shuts down the interpreter and frees any resources it
allocated during its lifetime. You should call this when you are
completely finished using the Python library. When you call
Py_Finalize, Python will unload all imported modules one by one.
Many modules must execute their own clean-up code when they are
unloaded in order to free any global resources they may have
allocated. For this reason, calling Py_Finalize can have the side
effect of causing quite a bit of other code to run.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>PyEval_SimpleString</b></span> is just
one way to execute Python code from within your C applications. In
fact, there is a whole collection of similar high-level functions.
<span   class="bold"><b>PyEval_SimpleFile</b></span> is just like
PyEval_SimpleString, except it reads its input from a
<b  >FILE</b> pointer rather than a character buffer. See
the Python documentation at
<a href="http://www.python.org/docs/api/veryhigh.html" target="_self">www.python.org/docs/api/veryhigh.html</a>
for complete documentation on these high-level functions.</p><p>In addition to evaluating Python scripts, you can also
manipulate Python objects and call Python functions directly from
your C code. While this involves more complex C code than using
PyEval_SimpleString, it also allows access to more detailed
information. For example, you can access objects returned from
Python functions or determine if an exception has been
thrown.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b00f50"></a>Extending Python</h2></div></div><p>When you embed Python within your application, it is often
desirable to provide a small module that exposes an API related to
your application so that scripts executing within the embedded
interpreter have a way to call back into the application. This is
done by providing your own Python module, written in C, and is
exactly the same as writing normal Python modules. The only
difference is your module will function properly only within the
embedded interpreter.</p><p>Extending Python requires some understanding of how the
Python interpreter manipulates objects from C. All function
arguments and return values are pointers to PyObject structures,
which are the C representation of real Python objects. You can make
use of various function calls to manipulate PyObjects. Listing 2 is
a simple example of a Python module extension written in C. This is
the source to the Python <span   class="bold"><b>crypt</b></span>
module, which provides one-way hashing used in password
authentication.</p><p><a href="3641l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>All C implementations of Python-callable functions take two
arguments of type PyObject. The first argument is always &ldquo;self&rdquo;,
the object whose method is being called (similar to the infamous
&ldquo;this&rdquo; pointer in C++). The second object contains all the
arguments to the function.
<span   class="bold"><b>PyArg_Parse</b></span> is used to extract
values from a PyObject containing function arguments. You do this
by passing, in the PyObject which contains the values, a format
string which represents the data types you expect to be there, and
one or more pointers to data types to be filled in with values from
the PyObject. In Listing 2, the function takes two strings,
represented by <b  >"(ss)"</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>PyArg_Parse</b></span> is similar to the C
function <span   class="bold"><b>sscanf</b></span>, except it
operates on a PyObject rather than a character buffer. In order to
return a string value from the function, call
<span   class="bold"><b>PyString_FromString</b></span>. This helper
function takes a <b  >char*</b> value and converts it
into a PyObject.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b01420"></a>Python, C and Threads</h2></div></div><p>C programs can easily create new threads of execution. Under
Linux, this is most commonly done using the POSIX Threads
(pthreads) API and the function call
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_create</b></span>. For an overview of
how to use pthreads, see &ldquo;POSIX Thread Libraries&rdquo; by Felix Garcia
and Javier Fernandez at
<a href="../070/3184.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue70/3184.html</a>
in the &ldquo;Strictly On-line&rdquo; section of <i  >LJ</i>,
February 2000. In order to support multi-threading, Python uses a
mutex to serialize access to its internal data structures. I will
refer to this mutex as the &ldquo;global interpreter lock&rdquo;. Before a
given thread can make use of the Python C API, it must hold the
global interpreter lock. This avoids race conditions that could
lead to corruption of the interpreter state.</p><p>The act of locking and releasing this mutex is abstracted by
the Python functions
<span   class="bold"><b>PyEval_AcquireLock</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>PyEval_ReleaseLock</b></span>. After calling
PyEval_AcquireLock, you can safely assume your thread holds the
lock; all other cooperating threads are either blocked or executing
code unrelated to the internals of the Python interpreter, and you
may now call arbitrary Python functions. Once acquiring the lock,
however, you must be certain to release it later by calling
PyEval_ReleaseLock. Failure to do so will cause a thread deadlock
and freeze all other Python threads.</p><p>To complicate matters further, each thread running Python
maintains its own state information. This thread-specific data is
stored in an object called <b  >PyThreadState</b>. When
calling Python API functions from C in a multi-threaded
application, you must maintain your own PyThreadState objects in
order to safely execute concurrent Python code.</p><p>If you are experienced in developing threaded applications,
you might find the idea of a global interpreter lock rather
unpleasant. Well, it's not as bad as it first appears. While Python
is interpreting scripts, it periodically yields control to other
threads by swapping out the current PyThreadState object and
releasing the global interpreter lock. Threads previously blocked
while attempting to lock the global interpreter lock will now be
able to run. At some point, the original thread will regain control
of the global interpreter lock and swap itself back in.</p><p>This means when you call PyEval_SimpleString, you are faced
with the unavoidable side effect that other threads will have a
chance to execute, even though you hold the global interpreter
lock. In addition, making calls to Python modules written in C
(including many of the built-in modules) opens the possibility of
yielding control to other threads. For this reason, two C threads
that execute computationally intensive Python scripts will indeed
appear to share CPU time and run concurrently. The downside is
that, due to the existence of the global interpreter lock, Python
cannot fully utilize CPUs on multi-processor machines using
threads.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b01898"></a>Enabling Thread Support</h2></div></div><p>Before your threaded C program is able to make use of the
Python API, it must call some initialization routines. If the
interpreter library is compiled with thread support enabled (as is
usually the case), you have the runtime option of enabling threads
or not. Do not enable runtime threading support unless you plan on
using threads. If runtime support is not enabled, Python will be
able to avoid the overhead associated with mutex locking its
internal data structures. If you are using Python to extend a
threaded application, you will need to enable thread support when
you initialize the interpreter. I recommend initializing Python
from within your main thread of execution, preferably during
application startup, using the following two lines of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
// initialize Python
Py_Initialize();
// initialize thread support
PyEval_InitThreads();
</pre><p>Both functions return void, so there are no error codes to
check. You can now assume the Python interpreter is ready to
execute Python code. <span   class="bold"><b>Py_Initialize</b></span>
allocates global resources used by the interpreter library. Calling
<span   class="bold"><b>PyEval_InitThreads</b></span> turns on the
runtime thread support. This causes Python to enable its internal
mutex lock mechanism, used to serialize access to critical sections
of code within the interpreter. This function also has the side
effect of locking the global interpreter lock. Once the function
completes, you are responsible for releasing the lock. Before
releasing the lock, however, you should grab a pointer to the
current PyThreadState object. You will need this later in order to
create new Python threads and to shut down the interpreter properly
when you are finished using Python. Use the following bit of code
to do this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PyThreadState * mainThreadState = NULL;
// save a pointer to the main PyThreadState object
mainThreadState = PyThreadState_Get();
// release the lock
PyEval_ReleaseLock();
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b01b58"></a>Creating a New Thread of Execution</h2></div></div><p>Python requires a PyThreadState object for each thread that
is executing Python code. The interpreter uses this object to
manage a separate interpreter data space for each thread. In
theory, this means that actions taken in one thread should not
interfere with the state of another thread. For instance, if you
throw an exception in one thread, the other snippets of Python code
keep running as if nothing happened. You must help Python to manage
per-thread data. To do this, manually create a PyThreadState object
for each C thread that will execute Python code. In order to create
a new PyThreadState object, you need a pre-existing
PyInterpreterState object. The PyInterpreterState object holds
information that is shared across all cooperating threads. When you
initialized Python, it created a PyInterpreterState object and
attached it to the main PyThreadState object. You can use this
interpreter object to create a new PyThreadState for your own C
thread. Here's some example code which does just that (ignore line
wrapping):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
// get the global lock
PyEval_AcquireLock();
// get a reference to the PyInterpreterState
PyInterpreterState * mainInterpreterState = mainThreadState-&gt;interp&lt;\n&gt;;
// create a thread state object for this thread
PyThreadState * myThreadState = PyThreadState_New(mainInterpreterState);
// free the lock
PyEval_ReleaseLock();
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2b01cb8"></a>Executing Python Code</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have created a PyThreadState object, your C
thread can begin to use the Python API to execute Python scripts.
You must adhere to a few simple rules when executing Python code
from a C thread. First, you must hold the global interpreter lock
before doing anything that alters the state of the current thread
state. Second, you must load your thread-specific PyThreadState
object into the interpreter before executing any Python code. Once
you have satisfied these constraints, you can execute arbitrary
Python code by using functions such as PyEval_SimpleString.
Remember to swap out your PyThreadState object and release the
global interpreter lock when done. Note the symmetry of &ldquo;lock,
swap, execute, swap, unlock&rdquo; in the code (ignore line
wrapping):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
// grab the global interpreter lock
PyEval_AcquireLock();
// swap in my thread state
PyThreadState_Swap(myThreadState);
// execute some python code
PyEval_SimpleString("import sys\n");
PyEval_SimpleString("sys.stdout.write('Hello from a C thread!\n')\n");
// clear the thread state
PyThreadState_Swap(NULL);
// release our hold on the global interpreter
PyEval_ReleaseLock();
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2af86a8"></a>Cleaning Up a Thread</h2></div></div><p>Once your C thread is no longer using the Python interpreter,
you must dispose of its resources. To do this, delete your
PyThreadState object. This is accomplished with the following
code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
// grab the lock
PyEval_AcquireLock();
// swap my thread state out of the interpreter
PyThreadState_Swap(NULL);
// clear out any cruft from thread state object
PyThreadState_Clear(myThreadState);
// delete my thread state object
PyThreadState_Delete(myThreadState);
// release the lock
PyEval_ReleaseLock();
</pre><p>This thread is now effectively done using the Python API. You
may safely call <span   class="bold"><b>pthread_exit</b></span> at
this point to halt execution of the thread.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2af88b8"></a>Shutting Down the Interpreter</h2></div></div><p>Once your application has finished using the Python
interpreter, you can shut down Python support with the following
code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
// shut down the interpreter
PyEval_AcquireLock();
Py_Finalize();
</pre><p>Note there is no reason to release the lock, because Python
has been shut down. Be certain to delete all your thread-state
objects with <span   class="bold"><b>PyThreadState_Clear</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>PyThreadState_Delete</b></span> before
calling Py_Finalize.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a08580.0x2af8b20"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Python is a good choice for use as an embedded language. The
interpreter provides support for both embedding and extending,
which allows two-way communication between C application code and
embedded Python scripts. In addition, the threading support
facilitates integration with multi-threaded applications without
compromising performance.</p><p>You can download example source code at
<a href="../listings/073/3641.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue73/3641.tgz</a>.
This includes an example implementation of a multi-threaded HTTP
server with an embedded Python interpreter. In order to learn more
about the implementation details, I recommend reading the Python C
API documentation at
<a href="http://www.python.org/docs/api" target="_self">http://www.python.org/docs/api/</a>.
In addition, I have found the Python interpreter code itself to be
an invaluable reference.</p></div></div>
