first language. Conectiva brings Linux to them.
</p><p>At the last COMDEX, I had the pleasure of chatting with the
Conectiva folks who flew all the way up to Las Vegas from Brazil
for the Linux Business Expo. <i  >LJ</i> was very
enthusiastic when we heard some time ago that Conectiva was
translating every man page, system message and other documentation
into Spanish and Portuguese, thus making Linux much more accessible
to an enormous user base. It has been wonderful to see how far
Conectiva has come in its endeavor to bring Linux to Latin America.
Already there are several software packages, as well as an exciting
new Brazilian magazine <span   class="emphasis"><em>Revista do
Linux</em></span>.</p><p>Circumstances of continental drift have brought North,
Central and South America fairly close together, and we have a lot
of shared history, although not all of it is particularly positive.
Nevertheless, one must put a regional perspective on the whole
affair to appreciate the enthusiasm many of us have had for this
project. Indeed, as Europeans often learn English in school,
English-speaking Americans are often taught Spanish. Public
telephones, ATMs, advertisements and more than a few signs are
often bilingual (although this might be largely a West Coast and
Southwest thing), so one cannot help but feel a kind of victory to
see Linux become translated into not just Spanish but also
Portuguese (which has typically been overshadowed by its more
widely spoken relatives). In fact, Conectiva is actually Brazilian,
so the Spanish translation was a secondary but much appreciated
endeavor.</p><p>Latin America is a bit behind the U.S. in terms of keeping up
with the latest in hardware, so on average, there are slower
processors, less RAM and smaller hard drives, making it difficult
and painful (if not impossible) to run the latest bloated
proprietary wares. Additionally, most people do not have the money
to waste on proprietary software, let alone expensive development
kits and the requisite fancy computers. When you look at the
situation in businesses which require several or even dozens of
computers, and especially the typically less-than-well-financed
universities, the price of licensing software is too high. Out of
necessity, this has led to the choice between having enough
computers and paying licensing fees for the software. When you
would be paying licensing fees to multi-billion-dollar corporations
in some foreign nation, the choice is fairly obvious. Even without
these considerations, the choice is obvious&mdash;you don't pay the
fees.</p><p>Unfortunately, every time money is involved with something,
people start pointing guns at each other. The Conectiva folks told
me stories of corporations being raided and executives leaving in
handcuffs, as well as universities being harassed and intimidated.
Apparently, it's a common occurrence (and we thought the &ldquo;hang
your boss&rdquo; campaign was going way too far). Alas, the zealous
persecution of software users in Brazil is driving businesses and
universities away from proprietary software and toward
Linux.</p><p>GNU/Linux is the ideal operating system for Latin America
because it provides everything universities, home users and
businesses need, all free of charge; it runs extremely well on
minimal hardware; and, of course, all the source code is available
and often well-annotated. A free C compiler alone is worth a
fortune. One need merely peruse the directories at Metalab to see
the wealth of free software (remember your first visit to sunsite
or the GNU archives?). Higher quality, completely for free, and
most relieving of all, no more living in fear of the police. You
can buy one copy of Linux and install it on every computer in your
lab. And you don't need anything more than a 486/33 (though the new
release will be Pentium optimized), so you can dig up any old PC
you've got lying around and have one more for your lab.</p><p>Networking is a breeze; that's probably what Linux does best,
and the free support from the community is priceless. Linux users
have typically been most fond not as much of the free price but of
the free source. Sometimes we forget that Linux also wins
economically.</p><p>Conectiva estimated at least 500,000 users in Brazil alone
(as of last November), with an expectation of one million in Latin
America by early 2000; that's a lot of users! Just think of what
one million more users will mean, in all areas from coding to
kernel hacking, debugging to support, evangelizing and even just
adding to that &ldquo;network externality&rdquo; effect. With Portuguese and
Spanish as the first languages of over 500 million people, one
million users is just the beginning.</p><p>Conectiva's translations have been thorough, compared to
typical commercial software which is only half-heartedly translated
(witness, for example, the Microsoft attempts at invading Asia; in
particular, the Korea fiasco). In the past, typical translations
from proprietary houses have had buggy character sets and ended up
with a weird mix of English and whichever language. You'd pop up a
menu, and some of the entries would be translated, but some not;
every time something unexpected happened, the machine would lapse
back into English. With Conectiva, you don't have these problems.
Pop up any weird man page, contrive your machine to spit out error
messages, and you'll get them in Portuguese. Together with the
translation efforts of the KDE and GNOME projects, you've got
double coverage. And should something untranslated come up, I'm
sure the &ldquo;open-source&rdquo; approach to software building also works
just fine for translation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a4580.0x259d000"></a>What Exactly is Conectiva Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Conectiva Linux is a company that concentrates on translating
Linux into Portuguese and Spanish. Its distribution, as one might
infer, is called Conectiva Linux. Translation is the primary
concern, so rather than creating the universe and assembling a
distribution from scratch, Conectiva based its wares on Red Hat and
worked from there. It's a reasonable decision, and Conectiva went
its own way right from the start&mdash;it's definitely not a hacked Red
Hat. While the typical hacker might have preferred a Debian base,
that's all in the past and Conectiva is what it is now. Conectiva
offers a standard edition and a server edition in either Portuguese
or Spanish, although many packages bundle various oddities such as
mouse pads, pins, pens, shirts, stickers, books and the like.
Honestly, I don't understand why distributors like to have so many
different packages, one package with different installation options
might be easier. Still, since Conectiva sees fit to divide Linux
between server and standard, let's have a look at what each edition
includes.</p><p>The standard edition is what you'd expect from a Linux
distribution, translated into Portuguese and Spanish. A normal
installation proceeds via the Red Hat installer, and even though
during one install I got a couple of warning messages about RPMs,
everything went along just fine, and on reboot, up popped the K
display manager (KDM).</p><p>Conectiva chose KDE, GNOME, WindowMaker, MWM, FVWM and Icewm.
Of these, FVWM, MWM and Icewm are about half translated, but the
system has also been translated, so one isn't relying on the GUI
for translation. These aren't just &ldquo;alternatives&rdquo; to KDE for
those who won't conform. Every window manager actually works. KDE
for all its perks does not look nearly sinister enough, and it's
important to appreciate the variety of excellent window managers
out there. Conectiva advertisements usually show funky WindowMaker
or Enlightenment screenshots, and if one has an artistic flair, one
might as well express it in all areas of life, including
Linux.</p><p>Conectiva left off an entry GNOME/Enlightenment on the K
display manager (accidentally, I presume). Therefore, if you want
your life to look like a scene from The Matrix, you'll have to add
an entry to KDM or start up GNOME by way of <b  >telinit 3;
gnome &amp;</b> as root (oh no, not the GNOME warning
message!). There is a general feeling that GNOME is the future (or
at least has a very big future), especially considering Helix GNOME
and even the Eazle project, so it would be nice if
GNOME/Enlightenment were more highly featured. I look forward to
the GNOME/Sawmill pairing, which I hope everyone including
Conectiva picks up on, since it runs quite efficiently on minimal
hardware. At the very least, GNOME's icons are outstanding.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a4580.0x259d268"></a>Eu soy um Servidor</h2></div></div><p>The server edition is a bigger installation in Portuguese and
Spanish. &ldquo;What's a distribution&mdash;a collection of software I can
download for free on the Internet?&rdquo; Caldera's Ransom Love once
asked, and honestly, it's worth asking. Basically, that's exactly
what a distribution is, with an installer, files placed into
various directories and a bunch of configuration files all filled
out. The server edition is packed with software that you can
download over the Net, but it's probably most convenient for people
who might not have high-bandwith connections. The documentation
will walk you through complete networking server setup,
configuration and administration.</p><p>Currently, the server distribution's number-one advantage
comes in the form of four large manuals: Lars Wirzenius'
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux System Administrator's Guide</em></span>, Olaf
Kirch's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrators Guide</em></span>,
and Conectiva's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server Guide</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>System Installation Guide</em></span>. Altogether, 1708
pages of documentation, and I must say, quite a good collection of
work. These manuals cover everything server-related, they're
thorough, and that's probably why they're included in the
Edi&lt;\#231&gt;&lt;\#227&gt;o Servidor. They're not condescending,
and would be nice for computer-proficient Linux newbies, but even
complete neophytes should find these books make for rapid learning
and valuable reference. Most normal users would probably choose the
standard edition of Conectiva, so they'll miss out on these
excellent texts unless Conectiva decides to include them next time
around.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a4580.0x259d528"></a>The Meaning of it, Mostly</h2></div></div><p>The point of Conectiva is not that it's the be-all, end-all,
fastest, best-configured Linux with all the software squeezed
magically on a 1.44MB floppy, a sentient living HAL 2000 that will
make tea and beat you at chess. The point of Conectiva is that it
makes Linux more accessible for hundreds of millions of potential
users, and it works just fine. I've been coding on it, networking,
configuring and customizing, and everything else your typical user
does, for several weeks now and everything works. RPM
installations, tgz installations, everything works fine without a
single glitch. The libraries are current and in the right places,
<span   class="bold"><b>ldconfig</b></span> knows where to find
everything, and only a couple of libraries needed to be updated
specifically for what I was doing--&gt;plug-and-program, an
improvement on plug-and-play. Setting up networking meant editing
the same files as on Red Hat or most anywhere else, and there is a
supply of the standard commercial applications, such as Netscape
and StarOffice. Conectiva is very easy to use, and I just cannot
find anything particularly wrong with it. If Linux is going to be
championed into new territories, it should be presented as well as
possible. Conectiva in many ways does this better than many
stateside distributors, from flashy ads and cool T-shirts to giving
users a choice of many well-configured desktops, with easy
installation and configuration, excellent manuals, support, and an
enthusiastic focal point for the Portuguese and Spanish speaking
Linux scene.</p><p>There are a couple of bugs to be ironed out, for example the
occasional warnings during installation, the absence of GNOME from
the KDM, the weird entries on the KDM login
(<span   class="bold"><b>gdm</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>postgress</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>xfs</b></span>), and root's mailbox getting
flooded with Radius error messages. SVGAlib needs to be updated,
SDL is missing, and if you program, you'll want to get the newest
versions of your favorite libraries. Since 4.0 came out a while
back there is now much to update for the next release. However,
with so much translation work already done, Conectiva will be more
able to concentrate on polishing and maintaining the
software.</p><p>There was a time when distributions had such different
libraries and files in different places that certain software would
work on some distributions but not on others. These days, we don't
really have that problem. Distributions are kind of a fetish; we
like the name Red Hat if we like Heinz ketchup, and if we
instinctively avoid brand names we instinctively avoid Red Hat, but
it doesn't matter half as much as it once did. Sure, there are
different config files, but you can change those without suffering.
And maybe some libraries are old and need to be replaced, but
that's part of running Linux; you're always out of date (and
perhaps without one).</p><p>The other part of running Linux is that it always works,
whatever name is on the box. I suppose, then, that this isn't a
review as much as an announcement of good news. Well, thank you to
Conectiva and everyone who has helped in the translation process
for making that possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a4580.0x259d898"></a>More Good News</h2></div></div><p>Conectiva is about to release its latest version, Conectiva
