    This article will help you understand print filters and how
    to create and install your own personalized filters.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15ba3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the December 1999 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, Michael Hughes introduced a few
basics for setting up printing on your Linux computer. This article
will go into greater detail on getting your print installation to
work for a variety of printers. The biggest problem is that most
applications, especially the graphics-based ones that run under X,
print using the PostScript printer language, and most of us do not
have a PostScript printer.
</p><p>I'm basically lazy&mdash;I want my computer to make things easier
for me. What's a computer for if not to automate tasks and simplify
my life? It didn't take me long to become frustrated with having to
deal with printing plaintext files vs. PostScript files from
Netscape or other applications. So I wrote a printer filter to take
care of these decisions for me, and you can, too. The BSD print
system that comes with your Linux distribution has the capability
to pipe print files through a filter, which can be any executable
program. Since the filters usually have a simple job to do, they
are normally written as a bash or Perl script.</p><p>The printer daemon sends the file to be printed to the
standard input of the filter, and the filter modifies the file as
needed. The filter can then write the modified file to standard
output, which the print system sends on to the printer. Your filter
can make any kind of modification to the file, and you don't even
have to write the modified file to standard output, as we shall see
later.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15ba608"></a>The BSD Printing System</h2></div></div><p>Specific printer capabilities are defined in the
/etc/printcap file, which is normally created when Linux is
installed. Each printer or printer configuration that you use must
be defined in this file. The printers can be attached locally,
attached to another computer on your network or to network
printers. You can set up multiple configurations for the same
printer to handle different file types, and the print system can
send output to other devices or save it to a file. Virtually
anything that can accept a computer file is fair game for the
output device.</p><p>Each printer configuration in your printcap file defines a
print queue. You print something from the command line with the
<span   class="bold"><b>lpr</b></span> command or through a print
button or menu in various applications. UNIX and Linux applications
use the lpr command to make the actual print request by using the
line-printer daemon, <span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span>, which
spawns a copy of itself to handle each print request.
<span   class="bold"><b>lpd</b></span> is the main program and runs
continuously in the background to handle all requests from lpr,
<span   class="bold"><b>lpq</b></span> (for querying print job and
printer status) and <span   class="bold"><b>lprm</b></span> (to
remove jobs from the print queue).</p><p>Listing 1 is a typical printcap entry that defines a printer
attached to your parallel printer port. Comments in the file start
with a hash (#) character. Each entry defines a printer queue and
consists of a series of fields delimited with the colon (:)
character. The first field of the entry supplies one or more names
for the print queue, separated by the pipe (|) character. You
should include &ldquo;lp&rdquo; as the name of one of your print queues,
since it will be the default queue when you print without
specifying a queue. The last sub-field of this first field should
contain a description of this print queue and may be displayed by
some print management software. I gave this queue an alias of
&ldquo;text&rdquo; so that the print command could be either <b  >lpr
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> or <b  >lpr
-Ptext <i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>.</p><p><a href="3741l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>For readability, I usually place each field on a separate
line, with the backslash escape character at the end of each line
except the last one. But you don't have to. It is traditional to
place extra colons at the beginning and end of each field when they
are given on separate lines, as in this example, with all
continuation lines indented by a tab. The extra colons are ignored
by lpd when it reads this file.</p><p>The fields after the first one tell lpd the properties for
this queue. Each of these subsequent fields begins with a keyword,
an equal (=) sign for text values or a hash (#) sign for numeric
values, and the value for the field. Some keywords are switches and
do not have values. In Listing 1, the second keyword, &ldquo;lp&rdquo;,
defines the device to which the output will be sent. In this case,
/dev/lp should be a symbolic link to /dev/lp0 or /dev/lp1 for your
printer port. Don't confuse this field name with the default print
queue name in the first field. The order of the fields does not
matter, except for the first field that names the queue.</p><p>The <b  >lf</b> keyword specifies the full path to
the log file, where errors from the print daemon concerning this
queue can be recorded. When something goes wrong, the contents of
this file may give you a clue to the problem, although many
print-related error messages will be sent to your system log,
/var/log/messages. The <b  >sb</b> boolean keyword tells
lpd to print a short one-line &ldquo;banner&rdquo;. Finally,
<b  >sd</b>, the spool directory keyword, lets you
specify the directory path in which to place a temporary copy of
the file being printed. You must specify a spool directory for each
print queue. Other controlling information for the queue and each
print job is also placed in this directory, so each queue in your
printcap file needs to have its own spool directory.</p><p>These are the most common of the many available parameters.
The printcap man page lists all the parameters that can be used to
configure your print queue entries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15badf0"></a>A Simple Print Filter</h2></div></div><p>If we want to modify the print file that is sent to a queue,
or perform some other task before printing, we use the output
filter printcap keyword, <b  >of</b>. The filter program
is usually kept in the spool directory for the queue which uses it,
such as /var/spool/lpd/lp1. Listing 2 shows a printcap entry that
uses a simple filter. The printer port is defined by the
<b  >lp=</b> field as usual. When we use the
<b  >of=/var/spool/lpd/filter</b> field, the print daemon
pipes the original file through this filter before it is sent to
the device set by the <b  >lp</b> field. After the
<b  >lf</b> field, I'm using the <b  >sf</b>
and <b  >sh</b> boolean fields to tell the print daemon
to suppress form feeds and suppress the header page for this
queue.</p><p><a href="3741l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>So what can we do with our printer filter? Just about
anything you could imagine. Listing 3 is a filter for printing
plain text on HP printers. When Hewlett-Packard printers are not
sent data in their native print language (such as PCL, HPGL or
Postscript), they expect MS-DOS line endings consisting of an ASCII
carriage return and line feed (newline). If you print a UNIX-style
text file, which uses a newline only to mark the end of a line, the
second and subsequent lines of your file will not start on the left
edge of the paper. Without the carriage return to tell the printer
to move to the left edge, you get a stairstep effect. There is no
line wrap, so once the text moves off the right edge of the paper,
all is lost to the proverbial bit bucket.</p><p><a href="3741l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>This filter uses the <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>
command to insert a carriage-return and newline at the end of each
line of UNIX text. As I mentioned above, the BSD printer daemon
pipes the file being printed to standard input of the filter. It
then passes the standard output of the filter to the print device
specified on the <b  >lp=</b> field of the printcap
entry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15bb420"></a>Getting Sophisticated</h2></div></div><p>The above example works great to fix a common printing
problem, but it is good for text files only. If you accidentally
send a PostScript or, heaven forbid, a graphics file to this queue,
you will be rewarded with lots of useless paper and a scornful
system administrator.</p><p>Listing 4 is the filter we want to use to solve this problem.
First, we specify a log file where we can write debugging
information from the script. Next, we capture standard input to a
file with the <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> command. We can
then check this file to determine what kind of file it is using the
<span   class="bold"><b>file</b></span> command. If it is a text
file, we process it as we did in our simple filter above.</p><p><a href="3741l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>If the file is a PostScript file, we run
<span   class="bold"><b>ghostscript</b></span> to format it for our
particular type of non-Postscript Printer. In this case, I have
specified a Color Deskjet, which works for my HP Deskjet 660C. Of
course, if you should be so lucky as to have a PostScript printer,
you would not need this filter at all.</p><p>The last branch of our filter lets us print TIFF graphic
files. We simply insert the
<span   class="bold"><b>tiff2ps</b></span> command in front of the
<span   class="bold"><b>ghostscript</b></span> command. In this way,
you can easily add the ability to process other types of files
without manually formatting them. You might want to use the full
path names to the commands, since the lp daemon will not have the
same path that a login shell does.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15bb898"></a>Getting Smarter</h2></div></div><p>I also wanted my smart print queue to be able to deal with
several different printers. You see, I use a laptop for all my
e-mail and my personal computing. When I am at home, I use an old
Epson-compatible printer for simple print tasks. If I need higher
quality output, and my kids let me unplug it from their computer, I
connect to the HP Deskjet. When I am at work, I print to an HP
Laserjet 4MV PostScript printer on the network.</p><p>The change in printers is handled easily by adding
information about the type of printer to the filter. To set the
type of printer that is available, I added a line in $HOME/.profile
to ask me which printer I will be using. This is run once when I
first log in after booting up my laptop. The printer type I enter
is written to the file /tmp/printer. I use the names that
Ghostscript recognizes.</p><p>Listing 5 is the filter that uses the printer type
information. I added the variable <b  >PTYPE</b> to hold
the name of the printer I am currently using. The first-level
&ldquo;if&rdquo; branch checks for the file type, as in the previous filter.
Within these branches, a second-level &ldquo;if&rdquo; branch checks for the
different printers.</p><p><a href="3741l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>The other change in the filter is that instead of writing the
output to standard output, I pipe it to another lpr print command.
On the lpr command, I specify a print queue for the attached or
network printer. This bypasses the <b  >lp=</b> line in
printcap. For this to work, I created another printcap entry for a
print queue called &ldquo;raw&rdquo;. The raw printcap entry outputs to the
actual printer. To create a raw print queue, just take Listing 1,
remove the lp default name, and change the queue name to raw. I use
a different raw print queue for the network printer, since it is a
PostScript printer. Each raw printer has its own print queue in the
printcap file. The raw queue for whichever printer is attached to
the parallel port, and &ldquo;4mvraw&rdquo; is for the network printer when
I'm at work.</p><p>Listing 6 is the printcap entry for the above filter and its
corresponding raw print queue. One thing that is different in this
entry compared to that of a normal printer queue is using /dev/null
as the printer device. Since our filter will be handling the output
(by printing the filtered output to the raw device), we don't need
lpd to send it to any device.</p><p><a href="3741l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>If you have more than one printer available to you, you could
use this filter technique to send any of the different types of
files to different printers. And if you have a FAX modem, you could
even add a &ldquo;print to FAX&rdquo; feature to your printing system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15b25f8"></a>Activating Your New Print Queues</h2></div></div><p>After adding a new queue in /etc/printcap, you will need to
tell the print daemon to reread the printcap file. Listing 7 is a
script I wrote years ago to take care of the additional work
necessary to activate your new printcap entries. You may want to
verify the path names to the various directories and commands for
your system. You must run it as superuser.</p><p><a href="3741l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p>What if you do not always have a printer attached or
available, but you wanted to send something to the print queue for
printing at a later time? Will the job wait until you attach the
printer or connect to the network? Yes, it will if your raw printer
is attached to your parallel port because /dev/lp waits for
handshake signals from the printer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15b2808"></a>Some Debugging Tips</h2></div></div><p>If jobs fail to print, you need to determine if the problem
lies with the print system or your filter. The first place to look
is in your system log file, /var/log/messages, then look in the log
file for the queue. Next, carefully check the syntax in your
printcap file. Make sure each line except the last one for each
entry ends in a &ldquo;\&rdquo;. Turn on some debugging output to check the
operation of your filter. If the problem is with the print system,
you can try to stop and restart printing. You should have a script
in your system startup area that does this properly. In the SuSE
distribution, the startup and shutdown script is /sbin/init.d/lpd.
As with any System V-style boot script, this may be manually run as
/sbin/init.d/lpd start or /sbin/init.d/lpd stop.</p><p>A print queue can get stuck when the spool directory's disk
gets full. This can happen for a very large job or if your disk
partition is too small. You will have to remove the job with lprm
to free it up, then clean up unnecessary files on that disk
partition or move your spool directories to a larger partition.
After copying all the directories and files to a new location, you
can remove all the old directories
(<b  >rm&nbsp;-r&nbsp;lpd</b>) and replace the lpd
directory with a symbolic link to the new location where you have
copied the old lpd directory tree
(<b  >ln&nbsp;-s&nbsp;/path/to/new/location/lpd&nbsp;/var/spool/lpd</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c2580.0x15b2a18"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>We discussed how BSD printing works and some of the common
options in the printcap configuration file. We showed you how to
write a filter for altering the file that is sent to the actual
printer and how to write a filter that automatically processes
different types of input files for printing. We also learned that a
filter can redirect the output to different devices or files.
Hopefully, this will give you enough information to understand and
create your own &ldquo;smart&rdquo; printer queues and simplify your printing
tasks.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Mark Plimley (markp@blueneptune.com) started
