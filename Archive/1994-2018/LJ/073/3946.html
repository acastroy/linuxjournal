    If you want to outsmart the Spanish Inquisition, learn Python. This
    article is a practical introduction to writing non-trivial applications in
    Python.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x160e240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Despite what assembly code and C coders
might tell us, high-level languages do have their place in every
programmer's toolbox, and some of them are much more than a
computer-science curiosity. Out of the many high-level languages we
can choose from today, Python seems to be the most interesting for
those who want to learn something new and do real work at the same
time. Its no-nonsense implementation of object-oriented programming
and its clean and easy-to-understand syntax make it a language that
is <span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> to learn and use, which is not
something we can say about most other languages.
</p><p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to write applications
that use command-line options, read and write to pipes, access
environment variables, handle interrupts, read from and write to
files, create temporary files and write to system logs. In other
words, you will find recipes for writing real applications instead
of the old boring <b  >Hello, World!</b> stuff.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x160e450"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>To begin, if you have not installed the Python interpreter on
your system, now is the time. To make that step easier, install the
latest Python distribution using packages compatible with your
Linux distribution. rpm, deb and tgz are also available on your
Linux CD-ROM or on-line. If you follow standard installation
procedures, you should not have any problems.</p><p>Next, read the excellent <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Tutorial</em></span>
written by Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming
language. This tutorial is part of the official Python
documentation, and you can find it in either the
/usr/doc/python-docs-1.5.2 or /usr/local/doc/python-docs-1.5.2
catalog. It may be delivered in the raw LaTeX format, which must be
processed first; if you don't know how to do this, go to
<a href="http://www.python.org/doc" target="_self">http://www.python.org/doc/</a>
to download it in an alternative format.</p><p>I also recommend that you have the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Library
Reference</em></span> handy; you might want it when the explanations
given here do not meet your needs. You can find it in the same
places as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Tutorial</em></span>.</p><p>Creating scripts can be done using your favorite text editor
as long as it saves text in plain ASCII format and does not
automatically insert line breaks when the line is longer than the
width of the editor's window.</p><p>Always begin your scripts with either</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/local/bin/python
</pre><p>or
<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/bin/python
</pre>


If the access path to the <b  >python</b> binary on your
system is different, change that line, leaving the first two
characters (<b  >#!</b>) intact. Be sure this line is
truly the first line in your script, not just the first non-blank
line&mdash;it will save you a lot of frustration.
</p><p>Use <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> to set the file
permissions on your script to make it executable. If the script is
for you alone, type <b  >chmod 0700
<i><tt>scriptfilename</tt></i>.py</b>; if you want
to share it with others in your group but not let them edit it, use
<b  >0750</b> as the chmod value; if you want to give
access to everyone else, use the value <b  >0755</b>. For
help with the chmod command, type <b  >man
chmod</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x160ec38"></a>Reading Command-Line Options and
Arguments</h2></div></div><p>Command-line options and arguments come in handy when we want
to tell our scripts how to behave or pass some arguments (file
names, directory names, user names, etc.) to them. All programs can
read these options and arguments if they want, and your Python
scripts are no different.</p><p>Implementing appropriate handlers boils down to reading the
<b  >argv</b> list and checking for the options and
arguments you want your script to recognize. There are a few ways
to do this. Listing 1 is a simple option handler that recognizes
common -h, -help and --help options, and when they are found, it
exits immediately after displaying the help message.</p><p><a href="3946l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Copy and save this script as help.py, make it executable with
the <b  >chmod&nbsp;0755&nbsp;help.py</b> command, and
run it several times, specifying different options, both recognized
by the handler and not; e.g. with one of the options, you will see
this message: <b  >./help.py&nbsp;-h</b> or
<b  >./help.py&nbsp;-o</b>. If the option handler does
recognize one of the options, you will see this message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
help.py&mdash;does nothing useful (yet)
options: -h, -help, or --help&mdash;display this help
Copyright (c) Jacek Artymiak, 2000
</pre><p>If you invoke <b  >help.py</b> with an option it
does not recognize, or without any options at all, it will display
the &ldquo;I don't recognize this option&rdquo; message.
</p><p>Note that we need to import the
<span   class="bold"><b>sys</b></span> module before we can check the
contents of the <b  >argv</b> list and before we can call
the <span   class="bold"><b>exit</b></span> function. The
<span   class="bold"><b>sys.exit</b></span> statement is a safety
feature which prevents further program execution when one of the
help options is found inside the <b  >argv</b> list. This
ensures that users don't do something dangerous before reading the
help messages (for which they wouldn't have a need
otherwise).</p><p>The simple help option handler described above works quite
well and you can duplicate and change it to recognize additional
options, but that is not the most efficient way to recognize
multiple options with or without arguments. The &ldquo;proper&rdquo; way to
do it is to use the <span   class="bold"><b>getopt</b></span> module,
which converts options and arguments into a nice list of tuples.
Listing 2 shows how it works.</p><p><a href="3946l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Copy this script, save it as options.py and make it
executable. As you can see, it uses two modules: sys and getopt
which are imported right at the beginning. Then we define a simple
function that displays the help message whenever something goes
wrong.</p><p>The actual processing of command-line arguments begins with
the <b  >try</b> statement, where we are testing the list
of command-line options and arguments (sys.argv) for errors defined
as unknown options or missing arguments; if they are detected, the
script will display an error message and exit immediately (see the
<b  >except</b> statement group). When no errors have
been detected, our script splits the list of options and their
arguments into tuples in the <b  >options</b> list and
begins parsing them by executing a series of loops, each searching
for one option and its expected arguments.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>getopt.getopt</b></span> function
generates two lists in our sample script:
<b  >options</b> which contains options and their
arguments; and <b  >xarguments</b> which contains
arguments not related to any of the options. We can safely ignore
them in most cases.</p><p>To recognize short (one-letter such as <b  >-h</b>)
and long (those prefixed with <b  >--</b>) options,
getopt.getopt uses two separate arguments. The list of short
options contains all of them listed in a single string, e.g.,
<b  >getopt.getopt(sys.argv,&nbsp;'ahoinmdwq')</b>. It is
possible to specify, in that string, options that absolutely
require an argument to follow them immediately (e.g.,
<b  >-v<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>) or after
a space (e.g., <b  >-v
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>). This is done by
inserting a colon (<b  >:</b>) after the option, like
this:
<b  >getopt.getopt(sys.argv,&nbsp;'ahoiv:emwn'</b>).
However, this creates a silly problem that may cause some confusion
and unnecessarily waste your time; if the user forgets to specify
the argument for the option that requires it, the option that
follows it becomes its argument. Consider this example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
script.py -v -h
</pre><p>If you put <b  >v:</b> in the short option string
argument of the getopt.getopt function, option
<b  >-h</b> will be treated as the argument of option
<b  >-v</b>. This is a nuisance and makes parsing of the
list of tuples <span   class="emphasis"><em>option, argument</em></span> much more
difficult. The solution to this problem is simple: don't use the
colon, but check the second item of the tuple that contains the
option (first item of the analyzed tuple) which requires an
argument. If it's empty, report an error, like the
<b  >-a</b> option handler.
</p><p>Long options prefixed with <b  >--</b> must be
listed as a separate argument to the getopt.getopt, e.g.,
<b  >getopt.getopt(sys.argv,&nbsp;'ah',&nbsp;['view',&nbsp;'file='])</b>.
They can be serviced by the same handler as short options.</p><p>What you do after locating options given by the user is up to
you. Listing 2 can be used as a template for your scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x1606758"></a>Handling Interrupts</h2></div></div><p>A properly written application, especially one that opens
files for writing or creates temporary files, ought to implement
interrupt handlers to ensure that no files are left corrupted or
undeleted when the user or the system decides to stop the execution
of our script.</p><p>Signals, like those sent when you press
<b  >CTRL-C</b> during the execution of your script, are
caught by handlers which may ignore them, allow default handlers to
be executed or perform custom actions. Python implements some
default handlers, but you can override them with your own code
using the <span   class="bold"><b>signal</b></span> module.</p><p><a href="3946l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>The function that lets us trap signals is
<span   class="bold"><b>signal.signal</b></span>. Its two arguments
are the number of the signal you want to trap and the name of the
signal handler. Listing 3 is a simple script that captures the
SIGINT (signal numbers have their own symbolic equivalents) signal
sent to it when you press <b  >CTRL-C</b>.</p><p>The SIGINT signal is not the only one you can capture. If you
want to capture additional signals, add more signal.signal calls to
handle them, changing the signal number (the
<b  >signal.SIG<i><tt>xxx</tt></i></b>
constant) and the name of the handler (optional; you can use the
same handler with more than one signal). To see what signals are
available in Linux, type <b  >kill -l</b> on the command
line.</p><p><a href="3946l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Signals can be ignored, which is useful if you want to
prevent some of them from disturbing the execution of your script.
Listing 4 shows the way to do so (be careful; this script can't be
stopped with <b  >CTRL-C</b>).</p><p>Another signal worth remembering is SIGALRM. Setting up a
handler for that signal allows you to stop the execution of your
script after the given number of seconds. This is done with
<span   class="bold"><b>signal.alarm</b></span> as shown in Listing
5.</p><p><a href="3946l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x1606f40"></a>Working with Files</h2></div></div><p><a href="3946l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>Many scripts need to work with files. Remember that before
you can read or write to a file, it must exist and be open. Listing
6 is an example of a script that opens a file for reading. Writing
to a file requires only a small change (see Listing 7).</p><p><a href="3946l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p>As you can see, the first of the two scripts shown in
Listings 6 and 7 fails to open a file for reading if the file
doesn't exist. This is correct behavior. The second script tries to
open a file for writing: if the file exists, it is truncated (i.e.,
its contents are deleted); if it doesn't exist, it is created. This
may not always be the desired behavior. When you want to append
some data at the end of a file, you ought to open it for writing,
while preserving its original contents. To do that, change the
second argument of the <span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span>
function from <b  >'w'</b> to
<b  >'a'</b>.</p><p>Once the file is open, we can read or write to it using these
methods:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span>(<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>):
reads at most <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> bytes from a file (if you omit
the number of bytes, the entire file will be read), e.g.,
<b  >fi.read(200)</b>, which reads up to 200
bytes.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>readline</b></span>: reads
one line at a time, e.g., <b  >fi.readline()</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>readlines</b></span>: reads
all lines from a file, e.g.,
<b  >fi.readlines()</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>(<span   class="emphasis"><em>string</em></span>):
writes <span   class="emphasis"><em>string</em></span> to a file, e.g.,
<b  >fo.write('alabama')</b>.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>writelines(</b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>list</em></span>):
writes a <span   class="emphasis"><em>list</em></span> of strings to a file, e.g.,
<b  >fo.writelines(['alaska&lt;\n&gt;', 'california&lt;\n&gt;',
'nevada&lt;\n&gt;'])</b></p></li></ul></div><p>When you want to close a file, use its
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span> method, e.g.,
<b  >fo.close()</b>.
</p><p><a href="3946l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p><p>If you want your script to create temporary files, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>tempfile</b></span> module. It simplifies the
task of creating temporary files by automatically creating unique
file names based on templates defined in variables
<b  >tempdir</b> and <b  >template</b>. It
doesn't create or delete temporary files itself, but you can
accomplish this using a method similar to the one used in Listing
8.</p><p>Note that you need to use both the
<b  >os.O_CREAT</b> and <b  >os.RDWR</b> flags
to tell the <span   class="bold"><b>os.open</b></span> function to
create a temporary file for both reading and writing. Also,
remember to close and remove all temporary files created before
exiting a script. You will find more information on the functions,
constants and variables used in that example in the os, posix and
tempfile sections of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Library Reference
Manual</em></span>.</p><p><a href="3946l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9</a></p><p>It is a good idea to implement a single handler that will
remove temporary files before exiting from the script, as in
Listing 9.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x1608280"></a>Working with Pipes</h2></div></div><p>Many command-line tools let us create pipes for processing
data, and it is a good idea to consider implementing this
functionality in your own scripts. Pipes allow us to read from the
standard input and write to the standard output of our script, as
well as read from the standard output and write to the standard
input of other commands.</p><p>Everything we need to implement pipes in our scripts is
stored in the <span   class="bold"><b>os</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sys</b></span> modules. Let's teach our
script to read data from its own standard input (represented by
<b  >sys.stdin</b>) and copy it, unchanged, to its own
standard output (<b  >sys.stdout</b>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/local/bin/python
import sys
sys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())
</pre><p>This works well, but doesn't allow us to modify the data
appearing on the script's standard input. This can be achieved in
several ways, depending on how much data you want to process at one
time. Listing 10 reads one line at a time and inserts
<b  >#</b> at the beginning of each line.
</p><p><a href="3946l10.html" target="_self">Listing 10</a></p><p>If you use the read(<span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>) method instead of
readline, you can set the number of bytes to be read from the
standard input. Listing 11 reads 256 bytes at a time.</p><p><a href="3946l11.html" target="_self">Listing 11</a></p><p>A slightly different approach is needed when you want to read
the whole file at one go. We use the
<span   class="bold"><b>sub</b></span> function from the
<span   class="bold"><b>re</b></span> module to perform a simple
substitution. See Listing 12.</p><p><a href="3946l12.html" target="_self">Listing 12</a></p><p>That's about all the basic knowledge needed to work with the
standard input and output of our script. However, Python can read
the standard output of external pipes or write to their standard
input. This time, we'll need to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>os</b></span> module and its
<span   class="bold"><b>popen</b></span> function.</p><p>Listing 13 writes to the standard input of the pipe
<b  >sed&nbsp;'s/-/+/g' &gt;&nbsp;output</b> one hundred
lines of text, each containing the <b  >-</b> string. The
data passed to the pipe is then processed by
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> and ends up as one hundred
lines with <b  >+++</b>. You can read from a pipe, too.
Listing 14 shows you how.</p><p><a href="3946l13.html" target="_self">Listing 13</a></p><p><a href="3946l14.html" target="_self">Listing 14</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x191c3d0"></a>Writing to the System Log</h2></div></div><p><a href="3946l15.html" target="_self">Listing 15</a></p><p>If you develop applications that you want to keep an eye on
and leave a trace of their activity in the system log in a way
similar to many daemons running on a typical Linux system, you can
do so with the <span   class="bold"><b>syslog</b></span> function
located in the <span   class="bold"><b>syslog</b></span> module. To
enable writing to system logs, import the syslog module and add
calls to the <span   class="bold"><b>syslog.syslog</b></span>
function at those points needing to be documented in the system
log. See Listing 15 for an example.</p><p><a href="3946l16.html" target="_self">Listing 16</a></p><p>To see the output from your script, open another X terminal
window or switch to another console and type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /var/log/messages
</pre><p>to reveal what your script has just been doing. The output
looks like Listing 16.
</p><p>Remember that if you send the same message to the system log
several times in a row, it will be buffered until a different one
arrives in the system log buffer. It will appear there only once,
and the next line in the system log will indicate how many times it
was repeated. This bit of code,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/local/bin/python
import syslog
# some code
for a in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
        syslog.syslog('Hello from Python!')
</pre><p>will generate the following results:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Jan  20 00:04:33 localhost python: Hello from Python! Jan  20 00:04:49
localhost last message repeated 2 times
</pre>


Don't treat the system log like a trash can where you can send any
kind of garbage; write only the most important information to it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1516580.0x191c9a8"></a>Reading Environment Variables</h2></div></div><p>Some scripts may need to access information stored in one or
more environment variables. Their values at the time your script is
executed are stored in the os.environ dictionary, available after
you import the os module. Here is the script that prints out all
the environment variables set at the time your script
executed.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

started.
