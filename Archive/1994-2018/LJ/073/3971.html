processor (see last month's article &ldquo;Transmeta Writes the News&rdquo;)
highlights an emerging class of computing devices, often called
webpads. These devices provide high-quality web access in a
conveniently portable design. Resembling the display portion of a
mobile PC (see Figure 1), webpads have no bulky keyboard or heavy
disk drives. Better yet, they don't need Microsoft Windows&mdash;Linux
or other low-cost operating systems are preferred.

</p><p>These devices are only beginning to reach the market, and
with prices as high as $999, they will appeal mainly to front-line
soldiers in the gadget wars. But prices will inevitably fall, and
at under $500, webpads will offer a great alternative to those who
want the Web without the hassle of a Windows PC. Although webpads
don't have to use Linux, its reliability, modest memory footprint
and especially its open source code make it an excellent
choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1274580.0x136c9d0"></a>Why Webpads?</h2></div></div><p>Webpads offer several advantages over a PC. The first is ease
of use. A webpad does one thing: browse the Web. With a dedicated
browser on top of a stripped-down version of Linux, the system
provides a simple, reliable interface with minimal boot time.
Microsoft offers Windows CE for such &ldquo;information appliances&rdquo;,
but that OS still bears the scars of its Windows heritage.</p><p>Webpads offer mobility that can't be matched by a PC. All
sub-$1,000 PCs today are desk-bound. Even if you pay more to get a
notebook PC, you get a device weighing at least three pounds, and
more typically, five to seven pounds. This weight is mostly due to
hard drives, CD drives, large batteries and cooling mechanisms
(fans and heat sinks) for the Intel-compatible CPU.</p><p>A webpad weighs only about one pound and has a longer battery
life, despite using a smaller, lighter battery. Like a cordless
telephone, it links to a base station using radio frequencies.
Thus, a webpad will operate anywhere within a typical house or
small office. The wireless link transfers data at 2 to
11MBps&mdash;enough to keep up with even a DSL Internet connection.
Eliminating the drives gives webpads a sizable cost advantage, at
least when compared to mobile PCs. In contrast to the cheapest
desktop PCs, webpads will cost more, because their flat-screen
displays are more expensive than CRTs and also due to the cost of
the wireless link.</p><p>Today's PCs also benefit from economies of scale. Within a
few years, increasing volumes and lower-cost screens should bring a
webpad under $500, the price of the least expensive PC with
monitor. At this price, webpads should greatly increase in
popularity.</p><p>Other non-PC devices already provide web access, including
WebTV, Sega's Dreamcast and the Palm VII. WebTV and similar devices
use a standard low-resolution TV as the display, so they can't
display a full web page from most sites without scrolling. And, of
course, they aren't mobile. The Palm VII uses cell-phone technology
to provide unmatched mobility, but its display has even less
resolution than a TV, limiting it to web sites designed
specifically for the hand-held device. A webpad, in contrast, will
typically have a VGA or better color LCD display comparable to a
14-inch monitor, providing full compatibility with any web site.
The Palm VII also requires a monthly cellular subscription fee; the
webpad does not.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1274580.0x136cc38"></a>Web Model Threatens PCs</h2></div></div><p>Of course, webpads are not PCs and aren't compatible with the
vast range of PC software. But they are good for accessing a
variety of services over the Web, including news, shopping, e-mail,
chat, banking, voice mail and whatever the dot-coms think of next.
In fact, the plethora of new web services is undermining the value
of the PC's flexibility. You used to need a PC if you wanted to log
your appointments, maintain an address book, track your stock
portfolio and calculate your income taxes. Now all these services
are available on any platform with a web browser. Still, webpads
won't replace most PCs in the foreseeable future.</p><p>Using an on-screen keyboard or handwriting recognition,
webpad users can enter URLs and short e-mail messages, but these
interfaces are not ideal for creating memos, papers, spreadsheets,
drawings and other documents needed for school, work and even some
personal uses. High-quality voice recognition could begin to close
the gap, but that is still years away. In short, webpads are ideal
for viewing and interacting with information, while PCs remain an
efficient platform for creating content. PCs are likely to stay on
most business desktops and in many homes for this reason. However,
high-income households may someday contain a single PC and one or
more webpads instead of multiple PCs.</p><p>The real opportunity lies in penetrating the households that
don't have a PC today: 50% of the U.S. market and far more in other
regions. Many of these consumers can afford a PC, but don't want to
deal with the complexity of that platform. By eliminating Windows,
a Linux-based webpad solves this problem. Even if they don't
displace PCs, webpads could one day outsell them.</p></div></div>
