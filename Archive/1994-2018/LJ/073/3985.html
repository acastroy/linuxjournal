    Communication is the key to healthy relationships between
    threads and the kernel; these are the signals they use to communicate.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a1580.0x1599500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Signals are used to notify a process or
thread of a particular event. Many computer science researchers
compare signals with hardware interrupts, which occur when a
hardware subsystem, such as a disk I/O (input/output) interface,
generates an interrupt to a processor when the I/O completes. This
event in turn causes the processor to enter an interrupt handler,
so subsequent processing can be done in the operating system based
on the source and cause of the interrupt.
</p><p>UNIX guru W. Richard Stevens aptly describes signals as
software interrupts. When a signal is sent to a process or thread,
a signal handler may be entered (depending on the current
disposition of the signal), which is similar to the system entering
an interrupt handler as the result of receiving an
interrupt.</p><p>Operating system signals actually have quite a history of
design changes in the signal code and various implementations of
UNIX. This was due in part to some deficiencies in the early
implementation of signals, as well as the parallel development work
done on different versions of UNIX, primarily BSD UNIX and AT&amp;T
System V. James Cox, Berny Goodheart and W. Richard Stevens cover
these details in their respective well-known books, so they don't
need to be repeated here.</p><p>Implementation of correct and reliable signals has been in
place for many years now, where an installed signal handler remains
persistent and is not reset by the kernel. The POSIX standards
provided a fairly well-defined set of interfaces for using signals
in code, and today the Linux implementation of signals is fully
POSIX-compliant. Note that reliable signals require the use of the
newer <span   class="bold"><b>sigaction</b></span> interface, as
opposed to the traditional <span   class="bold"><b>signal</b></span>
call.</p><p>The occurrence of a signal may be synchronous or asynchronous
to the process or thread, depending on the source of the signal and
the underlying reason or cause. Synchronous signals occur as a
direct result of the executing instruction stream, where an
unrecoverable error (such as an illegal instruction or illegal
address reference) requires an immediate termination of the
process. Such signals are directed to the thread which caused the
error with its execution stream. As an error of this type causes a
trap into a kernel trap handler, synchronous signals are sometimes
referred to as traps.</p><p>Asynchronous signals are external to (and in some cases,
unrelated to) the current execution context. One obvious example
would be the sending of a signal to a process from another process
or thread via a kill(2), _lwp_kill(2) or sigsend(2) system call, or
a thr_kill(3T), pthread_kill(3T) or sigqueue(3R) library
invocation. Asynchronous signals are also aptly referred to as
interrupts.</p><p>Every signal has a unique signal name, an abbreviation that
begins with <b  >SIG</b> (<b  >SIGINT</b> for
interrupt signal, for example) and a corresponding signal number.
Additionally, for all possible signals, the system defines a
default disposition or action to take when a signal occurs. There
are four possible default dispositions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Exit: forces the process to exit.</p></li><li><p>Core: forces the process to exit and create a core
file.</p></li><li><p>Stop: stops the process.</p></li><li><p>Ignore: ignores the signal; no action taken.</p></li></ul></div><p>A signal's disposition within a process's context defines
what action the system will take on behalf of the process when a
signal is delivered. All threads and LWPs (lightweight processes)
within a process share the signal disposition, which is processwide
and cannot be unique among threads within the same process.
</p><p><a href="3985t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>Table 1 provides a complete list of signals, along with a
description and default action. The data structures in the kernel
to support signals in Linux are to be found in the task structure.
Here are the most common elements of said structure pertaining to
signals:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>current</b></span><b  >--&gt;<i><tt>sig</tt></i></b>
are the signal handlers.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sigmask_lock</b></span> is a
per-thread spinlock which protects the signal queue and atomicity
of other signal operations.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>current-signal</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>current-blocked</b></span> contain a bitmask
(currently 64 bits long, but freely expandable) of pending and
permanently blocked signals.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sigqueue</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sigqueue_tail</b></span> is a double-linked
list of pending signals&mdash;Linux has RT signals which can be queued
as well. &ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; signals are internally mapped to RT
signals.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a1580.0x159a3c8"></a>Signal Description and Default Action</h2></div></div><p>The disposition of a signal can be changed from its default,
and a process can arrange to catch a signal and invoke a
signal-handling routine of its own or ignore a signal that may not
have a default disposition of <b  >Ignore</b>. The only
exceptions are <b  >SIGKILL</b> and
<b  >SIGSTOP</b>; their default dispositions cannot be
changed. The interfaces for defining and changing signal
disposition are the signal and sigset libraries and the
<span   class="bold"><b>sigaction</b></span> system call. Signals can
also be blocked, which means the process has temporarily prevented
delivery of a signal. Generation of a signal that has been blocked
will result in the signal remaining as pending to the process until
it is explicitly unblocked or the disposition is changed to
<b  >Ignore</b>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>sigprocmask</b></span> system call will set
or get a process's signal mask, the bit array inspected by the
kernel to determine if a signal is blocked or not.
<span   class="bold"><b>thr_setsigmask</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_sigmask</b></span> are the equivalent
interfaces for setting and retrieving the signal mask at the
user-threads level.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that a signal may originate from several
different places for a variety of different reasons. The first
three signals listed in Table 1&mdash;<b  >SIGHUP</b>,
<b  >SIGINT</b> and <b  >SIGQUIT</b>&mdash;are
generated by a keyboard entry from the controlling terminal
(<b  >SIGINT</b> and <b  >SIGHUP</b>) or if the
control terminal becomes disconnected
(<b  >SIGHUP</b>&mdash;use of the
<span   class="bold"><b>nohup</b></span> command makes processes
&ldquo;immune&rdquo; from hangups by setting the disposition of
<b  >SIGHUP</b> to <b  >Ignore</b>).</p><p>Other terminal I/O-related signals include
<b  >SIGSTOP</b>, <b  >SIGTTIN</b>,
<b  >SIGTTOU</b> and <b  >SIGTSTP</b>. For the
signals originating from a keyboard command, the actual key
sequence that generates the signals, usually
<b  >CTRL-C</b>, is defined within the parameters of the
terminal session, typically via <b  >stty(1)</b> which
results in a <b  >SIGINT</b> being sent to a process, and
has a default disposition of <b  >Exit</b>.</p><p>User tasks in Linux, created via explicit calls to either
<span   class="bold"><b>thr_create</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>pthread_create</b></span>, all have their own
signal masks. Linux threads call
<span   class="bold"><b>clone</b></span> with
<b  >CLONE_SIGHAND</b>; this shares all signal handlers
between threads via sharing the <b  >current-&gt;sig</b>
pointer. Delivered signals are unique to a thread.</p><p>In some operating systems, such as Solaris 7, signals
generated as a result of a trap (<b  >SIGFPE</b>,
<b  >SIGILL</b>, etc.) are sent to the thread that caused
the trap. Asynchronous signals are delivered to the first thread
found not blocking the signal. In Linux, it is almost exactly the
same. Synchronous signals happening in the context of a given
thread are delivered to that thread.</p><p>Asynchronous in-kernel signals (e.g., asynchronous network
I/O) is delivered to the thread that generated the asynchronous
I/O. Explicit user-generated signals get delivered to the right
thread as well. However, if <b  >CLONE_PID</b> is used,
all places that use the PID to deliver a signal will behave in a
&ldquo;weird&rdquo; way; the signal gets randomly delivered to the first
thread in the <b  >pidhash</b>. Linux threads don't use
<b  >CLONE_PID</b>, so there is no such problem if you
are using the pthreads.h thread API.</p><p>When a signal is sent to a user task, for example, when a
user-space program accesses an illegal page, the following
happens:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>page_fault</b></span>
(entry.S) in the low-level page-fault handler.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>do_page_fault</b></span>
(fault.c) fetches i386-specific parameters of the fault and does
basic validation of the memory range involved.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>handle_mm_fault</b></span>
(memory.c) is generic MM (memory management) code
(i386-independent), which gets called only if the memory range
(VMA) exists. The MM reads the page table entry and uses the VMA to
find out whether the memory access is legal or not.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="3985l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>
</p><p>The case we are interested in now is when the access was
illegal (e.g., a write was attempted to a read-only mapping):
handle_mm_fault returns 0 to do_page_fault in this case. As you can
see from Listing 1, locking of the MM is very finely grained (and
it better be this way); the <b  >mm-&gt;mmap_sem</b>,
per-MM semaphore, is used (which typically varies from process to
process).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>force_sig</b></span>(<b  >SIGBUS</b>,<b  >current</b>)
is used to &ldquo;force&rdquo; the <b  >SIGBUS</b> signal on the
faulting task. force_sig delivers the signal even if the process
has attempted to ignore <b  >SIGBUS</b>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>force_sig</b></span> fills out the
signal event structure and queues it into the process's signal
queue (<b  >current-&gt;sigqueue</b> and
<b  >current-&gt;sigqueue_tail</b>). The signal queue
holds an indefinite number of queued signals. The semantics of
&ldquo;classic&rdquo; signals are that follow-up signals are ignored&mdash;this is
emulated in the signal code kernel/signal.c. &ldquo;Generic&rdquo; (or RT)
signals can be queued arbitrarily; there are reasonable limits to
the length of the signal queue.</p><p>The signal is queued, and <b  >current-signal</b>
is updated. Now comes the tricky part: the kernel returns to user
space. Return to user space happens from
<b  >do_page_fault=&gt;page_fault (entry.S</b>), then the
low-level exit code in entry.S is executed in this order:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
page_fault=&gt;(called do_page_fault)=&gt;error_code=&gt;
ret_from_exception=&gt;(checks if return to user space)=&gt;
ret_with_reschedule=&gt;(sees that current-&gt;signal is nonzero)
=&gt;calls do_signal
</pre><p>Next, <span   class="bold"><b>do_signal</b></span> unqueues the
signal to be executed. In this case, it's
<b  >SIGBUS</b>.
</p><p>Then <span   class="bold"><b>handle_signal</b></span> is called
with the &ldquo;unqueued&rdquo; signal (which can potentially hold extra
event information in case of real-time signals/messages).</p><p>Next called is <span   class="bold"><b>setup_frame</b></span>,
where all user-space registers are saved and the kernel stack frame
return address is modified to point to the handler of the installed
signal handler. A small sequence of code jumper is put on the user
stack (obviously, the code first makes sure the user stack is
valid) which will return us to kernel space once the signal handler
has finished. (See Listing 2.)</p><p><a href="3985l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Careful: this area is one of the least-understood pieces of
the Linux kernel, and for good reason; it is really tough code to
read and follow.</p><p>The <b  >popl %eax ; movl $,%eax ; int $0x80</b>
x86 assembly sequence calls
<span   class="bold"><b>sys_sigret</b></span>, which later on will
restore the kernel stack frame return address to point to the
original (faulting) user address.</p><p>What is all this magic good for? Well, first the kernel has
to guarantee that signal handlers get called properly and the
original state is restored. The kernel also has to deal with binary
compatibility issues. Linux guarantees that on the IA-32 (Intel
x86) architecture, we can run any iBC86-compliant binary code.
Speed is also an issue.</p><p><a href="3985l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Finally, we return to entry.S <span   class="emphasis"><em>again</em></span>, but
<b  >current-signal</b> is already cleared, so we do not
execute do_signal but jump to
<span   class="bold"><b>restore_all</b></span> as shown in Listing 3.
<span   class="bold"><b>restore.all</b></span> executes the &ldquo;iret&rdquo;
that brings us into user space. Suddenly, we are magically
executing the signal handler.</p><p>Did you get lost yet? No? Here is some more magic. Once the
signal handler finishes (it does an assembly &ldquo;ret&rdquo; like all
well-behaving functions), it will execute the small jumper function
we have set up on the user stack. Again we return to the kernel,
but now we execute the
<span   class="bold"><b>sys_sigreturn</b></span> system call, which
lives in arch/i386/kernel/signal.c as well. It essentially executes
the following code section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (restore_sigcontext(regs, &amp;frame-&gt;sc, &amp;eax))
     goto badframe;
return eax;
</pre><p>The above code restores the exact user-register contents into
the kernel stack frame (including the return address and flags
register) and executes a normal
<span   class="bold"><b>ret_from_syscall</b></span>, bringing us back
to the original faulting code. Hopefully the
<b  >SIGBUS</b> handler has fixed the problem of why we
were faulting.
</p><p>Now, while reading the above description, you might think
this is awfully complex and slow. It actually isn't;
<span   class="bold"><b>lmbench</b></span> reveals that Linux has the
fastest signal-handler installation and execution performance by
far of any UNIX running:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
moon:~/l&gt; ./lat_sig install
Signal handler installation: 1.688 microseconds
moon:~/l&gt; ./lat_sig catch
Signal handler overhead: 3.186 microseconds
</pre><p>Best of all, it scales linearly on SMP:
<pre     class="programlisting">
moon:~/l&gt; ./lat_sig catch &amp; ./lat_sig catch &amp;
Signal handler overhead: 3.264 microseconds
Signal handler overhead: 3.248 microseconds
moon:~/l&gt; ./lat_sig install &amp; ./lat_sig install &amp;
Signal handler installation: 1.721 microseconds
Signal handler installation: 1.689 microseconds
</pre>

bottom-half handlers (see sidebar) alike; there is no difference.

Imagine a thread is executing on one processor, and it gets an
asynchronous event (e.g., synchronous socket I/O signal) from an
IRQ handler (or another process) on another CPU. In that case, we
send a cross-CPU message to the running process, so there is no
latency in signal delivery. (The speed of cross-CPU delivery is
about five microseconds on a Pentium II 350MHz.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14a1580.0x1593228"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Once again, we notice how Linux is actually the technology
