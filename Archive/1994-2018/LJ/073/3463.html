save time and money. Products in the Etherminal line of thin
clients are built with that in mind. They are available in a
variety of configurations, including Java support, X support,
text-based terminal emulation and Microsoft Windows terminal
support.
</p><p>An innovative feature of these products is the fact that the
entire file system is stored in flash memory. This will eliminate
problems with improper shutdowns and the short lifespan of spinning
magnetic media in harsh environments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607d40"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>I tested the Etherminal J and the Instant TC (thin client)
products. The Etherminal J includes Netscape Communicator with Java
support, the Citrix ICA client, an RDP client, an X server,
terminal support and printer support. The Instant TC is a kit that
includes these features, but comes on an 8-bit ISA card with an
included S3 video adapter.</p><p>The Etherminal J is a turn-key unit that is 11-1/2 inches
wide by 8-3/4 inches deep by 2 inches tall. It includes mounting
feet to orient the unit vertically to save desk space. It's powered
by a 180MHz Cyrix processor with 32MB of RAM, on-board 10/100
Ethernet, 16-bit sound, S3 Video, two serial ports, one parallel
port and a PS/2 keyboard and mouse port. You need to supply the
monitor, keyboard and mouse.</p><p>Installing the Instant TC into a machine is quite easy,
consisting of installing the two cards and a supported network
card: only ISA and PCI NE2000 cards and the Intel EtherExpress
Pro.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607ef8"></a>Good Points</h2></div></div><p>Both products performed well in daily use. I used the
Etherminal J as my desktop machine for two days in order to get a
good feel for the performance.</p><p>A full version of Netscape was included with both products,
and it was more stable than the same version on my normal machine.
Once Netscape had loaded, it was very snappy and performed
well.</p><p>The Etherminal included terminal emulation support for
SCO-ANSI, Linux-ANSI, VT320, Wyse60 and SNI97801. The function keys
worked correctly when connecting to Linux servers, in addition to
an RS/6000 and an AS/400 to which I have access.</p><p>One use for the Etherminal is as an X terminal. You can
easily set up XDMCP to connect as a client to a larger machine or
run X applications remotely and have them appear on your local
display. With a 100Mbit network, the response was as good as
running them locally.</p><p>If you need access to Microsoft products, the Etherminal has
the capability to connect to the Windows Terminal Server and the
Citrix Metaframe Server. I don't have access to either of these,
but the clients are the same ones available from Citrix, so I have
no doubts as to their functionality.</p><p><a href="3463s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p><p>One pleasant surprise was how nice the fonts looked on the
Etherminal. They were nice, sharp 100dpi (dots per inch) fonts that
were very easy on the eyes. Selecting fonts for your applications
is made easy by the Igel Setup Program.</p><p>After starting either of the devices, you will arrive at an X
desktop. From the menu on the screen, you can run the Setup Program
which allows you to configure all aspects of the client software
including the keyboard, language, network, serial ports,
applications, time and date. Updating the firmware is also done
using the Setup Program.</p><p>The Setup Program is one place where the amount of work put
into this product is evident. Changing the setup is quite easy and
intuitive. Selecting a screen resolution takes only two clicks.
Adding remote applications to the menu is also easy. You need to
choose whether the remote host will be accessed using a text
emulation, a Windows Terminal emulation or via X. For text
emulation, there are selections to specify window background and
foreground colors, font size, cursor size and the size of the
window in rows and columns.</p><p>Documentation included with the Etherminal consisted of a
92-page manual covering the Etherminal C, W and J in English and
German and a 42-page manual for the actual hardware. The Etherminal
manual contains detailed information on how to configure your
Etherminal. The hardware reference manual covers BIOS setup.
However, you shouldn't need to modify any of the BIOS parameters
from their defaults.</p><p>In the course of my evaluation, I did find a few problems
with the Etherminal. Flash memory is much slower than most hard
drives. Netscape Communicator took over 60 seconds to load. A
dialog box did appear after launching Netscape, to reassure you it
was starting up. Closing and reopening Netscape got that time down
to under five seconds, showing that it had been cached in
memory.</p><p>Another point that isn't as obvious is that the flash memory
driver used for the Linux kernel on the Etherminal isn't released
under the GPL and is statically linked with the kernel. However,
Igel was the original author of the wrapper to link the M-Systems
driver with the kernel, and Igel has released the portion they
wrote.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1608420"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The Etherminal and Instant TC are both well-built and
well-designed products. They are excellent replacements for dumb
serial terminals, X terminals and older PCs. I have no problem
recommending them.</p><p><a href="3463s2.html" target="_self">Update</a></p></div></div>
