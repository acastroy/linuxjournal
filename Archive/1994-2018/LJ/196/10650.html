The BaseBoard4 from Demand Peripherals can contain different
combinations of 25 different character devices, all multiplexed on to a
single
USB-serial link. Its drivers, described here, show how writing drivers
in user space can get a complex device up and running quickly.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x210b580.0x22032a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Demand Peripherals, Inc., makes an FPGA-based robot controller that
gives a robot or other industrial control systems the high I/O pin count
and precise timing that a Linux laptop or single-board computer alone
cannot offer. The company has built more than 25 different FPGA-defined
peripherals for the controller, and it wanted to offer Linux device
drivers for all of them.
</p><p>
Doing 25 drivers in the kernel, although possible, would have required
time and effort far beyond what the company could afford. The process
of building kernel device drivers would have been even more complicated
because the FPGA card connects to the Linux host over a USB-serial link.
The solution, illustrated in Figure 1, is to have a d&aelig;mon manage the
USB-serial port and demultiplex the various FPGA-based peripherals
out to their own device nodes. The device nodes are little more than
shims that let the high-level application deal with separate device
entries for each peripheral.

Figure 1. Example of a User-Space Device Driver
</p></div></div><p>
The customer selects the mix of peripherals to be loaded into the FPGA.
Figure 2 shows a BaseBoard4 with some cards that demonstrate what might be
a fairly common peripheral mix. The system pictured has eight peripherals,
including a four-channel servo controller, a dual H-bridge controller,
a quad interface for the Parallax Ping))) range sensor, a RAM-based
pattern generator (driving the data and clock lines going to a 48-bit
shift register that connects directly to the LCD), a unipolar stepper
motor controller, a bipolar stepper motor controller, a quad event or
frequency counter (connected to a single Parallax light-to-frequency
sensor), and a dual quadrature decoder. Schematics for all of these
demo cards are on the Demand Peripherals Web site.

Figure 2. Robot Peripherals, All with Linux Drivers
</p></div></div><p>
All of the peripherals shown in Figure 2 can be configured and
controlled using device nodes in the /dev directory. The following
Bash commands, for example, might be part of the higher-level control
software for the system pictured:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# Feed wheel quadrature counts to a motor control program
cat /dev/dp/quad0 | my_motor_pgm &amp;
# Feed the same quadrature counts to a navigation program
cat /dev/dp/quad0 | my_navi_pgm &amp;
# Set a stepper motor step rate to 1000
echo "1000" &gt; /dev/dp/bstep1/rate
# Now step 300 steps
echo "300" &gt; /dev/dp/bstep1/count
# Monitor distance reported by a Parallax Ping)))
cat /dev/dp/ping0/dist &amp;
# Set a servo pulse width to 1.5 ms (1500000 ns)
echo "1500000" &gt; /dev/servo/servo4

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x210b580.0x22039e0"></a>
Use Cases</h2></div></div><p>
The above commands illustrate two of three important use cases
for the user-space drivers: sensor broadcast and driver configuration.
The third use case is bidirectional transfer.
</p><p>
The first use case is sensor broadcast, and in the example above, it's actually
multicast of sensor data.
Did you know that the /dev/input drivers implement a multicast mechanism?
Multiple readers get identical copies of the events that come from the input
devices. There is a simple experiment you can do to demonstrate this.
Press Ctrl-Alt-F2 (to go to a different console), log in, and run the
command <tt  >sudo cat /dev/input/mice | od
-b</tt>. Do the same for another console (for example, Ctrl-Alt-F3).
Now, move the mouse a little and switch between the F2 and F3 consoles.
They both display the same thing, don't they?
What a shame that Linux does not have some generic way to do multicast
like that of the /dev/input subsystem.
</p><p>
For robotics, the ability to fan a sensor reading out to several
processes is particularly important. For example, a quadrature encoder attached to
a wheel needs to be seen by both the motor controller
software and by the navigation software. The motor controller might
need to know if the wheel is turning to know whether the motor is stalled,
and the navigation software might count the wheel revolutions to compute
the robot's current location.
</p><p>
The second use case is peripheral or driver configuration. DC motor
controllers need to know the frequency of the PWM pulses. Stepper
motors need to know the step rate, and the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
ports need to be told the clock frequency and the mode of operation.
Either an ioctl() call or a sysfs-style interface can be used for driver
configuration.
</p><p>
Configuration interfaces can be a little tricky, in that the
information is often not a simple stream of bytes&mdash;it may encompass
several different pieces of information. An ioctl() interface typically passes a
data structure for complex configurations, while a sysfs interface might
use a space-separated list of ASCII-encoded values. Demand Peripherals
uses the ASCII-encoded numbers approach, because the overhead of decoding and
parsing a line of text is not too onerous given the relative infrequency
of driver configuration. Also, being able to <tt  >cat</tt> a sysfs type file
to see the driver configuration is kind of handy.
</p><p>
The third use case, bidirectional transfer, is really the most common use case.
You probably are already familiar with serial ports, the most common
example of bidirectional I/O. Although none are included in the examples
above, the FPGA-based robot controller needs bidirectional I/O for
peripherals that transparently pass data from one end to the other.
These include both FPGA-defined serial ports and SPI ports. You may
prefer, as we did, to be able to do block reads and writes until both sides
of the interface are open.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x210b580.0x2203da8"></a>
Requirements for User-Space Drivers</h2></div></div><p>
Our number one requirement for this project was
to spend as little programmer time as possible on it.
This meant minimizing the number of lines of code to be written and avoiding modifying
someone else's poorly or completely undocumented code. This requirement
also implied that we not try to hide our interfaces in an application
library. Because a library is part of the higher-level control
application,
you still would need a d&aelig;mon, still need some common IPC mechanism,
and still need to document the internal and the external interfaces.
The other problem with a library approach is that it is usually not
just one library; you may need to write a library, or binding, for every
programming language you want to support. Using a real character device
instead of a library means your customers can program in any language
they want, not just the ones for which you've written a binding.
</p><p>
The second requirement was that the driver security model be based
on file permissions. This implied that all of the device data and
configuration interfaces should be visible in the filesystem.
That is, you should to be able to do a <tt  >chmod 644</tt> on something like
/dev/dp/bstep1/rate.
Using named pipes and FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) could have fulfilled this requirement.
Doing this using pseudo-terminals would have been tricky.
</p><p>
Another requirement is that select() works both in the higher-level
control application and in the user-space driver itself. This requirement
comes about because select() is so much faster than threads in most
applications. Embedded systems, such as robotic or other industrial
control systems, often run on the cheapest, lowest cost hardware possible,
and, in the case of robots, often on battery power. These constraints lead
embedded Linux programmers to prefer select()-based systems.
</p><p>
FUSE often is suggested as a way to implement character drivers, but
I was unable to get select() to work on both sides of a FUSE interface.
I like FUSE; it can solve a lot of user-space driver problems, but it seems
unfair to me to ask FUSE, a filesystem, to double as a character
driver.
After all, who would expect ext3 or other kernel filesystems to have
built-in character drivers?
</p><p>
The last requirement was that writers block until a reader is
present. Both named pipes and pseudo-ttys allow the writer to write
4KB before blocking. It was important to us that the driver not fill
a buffer with stale data that a higher-level robotic application must
discard to get to the current data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x210b580.0x22040c0"></a>
A Simple Approach to User-Space Drivers</h2></div></div><p>
In the end, we didn't find any existing Linux facilities that satisfied all of
our requirements and use cases. However, we were able to find or create
two relatively simple device drivers that could.
Figure 3 illustrates the basic idea.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10650f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Two New Drivers Link Applications to Driver D&aelig;mons
</p></div></div><p>
The idea is to have two very thin drivers that sit between the higher-level applications and the user-space driver. These are real drivers and
appear as such to the higher-level software. The data exchanged between
the application and the user-space driver passes as transparently as
possible through the kernel. Even flow control passes transparently
between the application and the user-space driver.
</p><p>
The first use case, that of multicasting sensor data, is solved by
the &ldquo;fanout&rdquo; driver described in detail at <a href="http://www.linuxtoys.org" target="_self">www.linuxtoys.org</a>.
Demand Peripherals uses fanout devices for quadrature decoders, IR
receivers, ultrasonic range sensors, PlayStation controller interfaces,
event counters and all other continuously sampled sensors. Figure 4
shows the basic data flow in a fanout device.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10650f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. A Simple Multicast Device
</p></div></div><p>
You can skip further down in this article to get and install fanout, or
you can continue reading and come back to try the examples. Once you've
installed fanout and created the device nodes for it, you can test it
with a few simple commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat /dev/fanout &amp;
cat /dev/fanout &amp;
cat /dev/fanout &amp;
echo "Hello World" &gt; /dev/fanout

</pre>
</p><p>
The message appears three times, as you'd expect. Fanout is like
/dev/input in that it protects the writer, not the reader. If a reader
does not keep up, the reader gets the error, allowing the writer and
other readers to continue unimpeded.
</p><p>
For data flowing in the opposite direction, you need something like a
&ldquo;fan-in&rdquo; device&mdash;that is, something that protects the reader. A named
pipe works reasonably well for this.
</p><p>
The low-speed nature of driver configuration, the second use case,
makes possible several approaches. The approach we took was to write
a driver, called proxy, that solved both the configuration use case as
well as the bidirectional transfer use case. The two defining features
of proxy are that one side cannot write until the other side is open
for reading, and that a write of zero bytes is passed through the driver
and seen as a read of zero bytes at the other end. The usefulness of
the second feature is best shown by an example. Consider the case of
a user reading the current value of a configuration parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /dev/dp/bstep/rate
</pre>
</p><p>
/dev/dp/bstep/rate is a proxy device, and the user-space driver d&aelig;mon
on the other side of it would see that a write is possible when
<tt  >cat</tt>
opens the device. The d&aelig;mon writes the current value and then does a
write of zero bytes (both of which are read/seen by cat).
It is the write of zero bytes that tells cat it is done and can exit.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10650f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A Device to Pass Data between Two Applications
</p></div></div><p>
One drawback to the proxy driver is that it required the customer to
build and install a kernel module. Although Dynamic Kernel Module Support
can help, a lot of customers are intimidated by this even if it's
not that difficult [see &ldquo;Exploring Dynamic Kernel Module Support
(DKMS)&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, September 2003:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6896" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6896</a>].
FUSE is a good approach for customers who do not
want to deal with building modules and who don't need select() support.
</p><p>
Another approach for driver configuration is to use a regular filesystem file and the inotify facility to alert the user-space driver that
a new configuration is being requested. You get two nice features by
keeping the configuration files on a volume with persistent storage. The
first is that you don't need to provide any other configuration
storage&mdash;the files themselves are the persistent storage. Another nice feature
is that the driver starts immediately with the correct configuration
and does not need to be initialized from an external source. Inotify
works well with select() and is ideal in many situations, but be aware of a 
couple issues. You may have a race condition if your
driver modifies a configuration parameter before making it available.
Sound drivers often have this behavior&mdash;you can set the sample rate to
45KHz, but the driver probably will round it to closest standard value,
44.1KHz. If you do something like this with inotify, you may have a
window where a reader would get the wrong value for the configuration
parameter. Also, be aware that you may need to rebuild the
kernel to include inotify support.
</p><p>
You also can use UNIX sockets for driver configuration if you split
configurations reads from configurations writes. The problem is that
when the user-space driver d&aelig;mon accepts a socket open request, the new socket is
both readable and writable. The d&aelig;mon cannot tell if the user is
trying to write a new configuration value or trying to read the existing one.
One way around this problem is to have two sockets for every driver
configuration parameter, one socket for reading the current value and
another socket for setting the value.
</p><p>
There are a couple good ways to add bidirectional data streams to
your user-space drivers. The proxy driver provides this immediately and
was our choice for the robotics project. The other approach is to use
UNIX sockets. Sockets work well with select(), and their permissions map
into a filesystem, but they don't work easily with echo, cat and
command-line pipes. Also, if you use UNIX sockets for bidirectional
transfers, you
really shouldn't call them &ldquo;device drivers&rdquo; when you describe your system.

Installing the Fanout and Proxy Drivers</h2></div></div><p>
The fanout and proxy modules are fairly straightforward
to build and install. Be sure the kernel header files for
your kernel are available. Both drivers are in the tarball at
<a href="http://www.linuxtoys.org/usd/usd.tar.gz" target="_self">www.linuxtoys.org/usd/usd.tar.gz</a>. Download the driver tarball,
then untar, build and install the drivers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzf proxy.tar.gz
cd proxy
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
How and where you install your modules and create device nodes is a
matter of personal preference. You can, for example, add the following
to your rc.local startup script or put the equivalent commands in a
udev rules file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe fanout
FANOUTMAJOR=`grep fanout /proc/devices | awk '{print $1}'`
mknod /dev/fanout  c $FANOUTMAJOR 0
mknod /dev/fanout1 c $FANOUTMAJOR 1
mknod /dev/fanout2 c $FANOUTMAJOR 2
mknod /dev/fanout3 c $FANOUTMAJOR 3
mknod /dev/fanout4 c $FANOUTMAJOR 4
chmod 666 /dev/fanout*

modprobe proxy
PROXYMAJOR=`grep proxy /proc/devices | awk '{print $1}'`
mknod /dev/proxy  c $PROXYMAJOR 0
mknod /dev/proxy1 c $PROXYMAJOR 1
mknod /dev/proxy2 c $PROXYMAJOR 2
mknod /dev/proxy3 c $PROXYMAJOR 3
mknod /dev/proxy4 c $PROXYMAJOR 4
chmod 666 /dev/proxy*
</pre>
</p><p>
The robot's bootup scripts are slightly different because we wanted the
device node names to reflect the device it serves. For example, the dual
quadrature decoder might create fanout device nodes with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mknod /dev/dp/quad0 c $FANOUTMAJOR 0
mknod /dev/dp/quad1 c $FANOUTMAJOR 1
</pre>
</p><p>
The source tarball contains some simple demonstration programs in the
demo directory. The program pxtest2.c shows how to use the proxy device
to configure a user-visible string, and pxtest2 works by accepting a short
string and echoing it back on request. As mentioned above, drivers often
have to limit or otherwise modify a configuration value set by the user.
The pxtest2 program demonstrates this kind of processing by adding one
to each (non-newline) character in the input. You can run pxtest2 with
the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gcc -o pxtest2 pxtest2.c
./pxtest2 /dev/proxy &amp;
echo 111aaa222 &gt; /dev/proxy
cat /dev/proxy
# output of the cat command should be 222bbb333

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x210b580.0x21fbad8"></a>
Summary and Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>
Our ad hoc approach to building device drivers in user space
has some nice features. It does not add a lot of kernel code and does
not require any user-space libraries. It supports select() everywhere
you might want it, and it has good flow control for streamed data.
</p><p>
Fanout and proxy have some shortcomings too. The data stream from
a fanout device is byte-aligned, which makes it inappropriate for an
application that needs to send blocks of binary data. Fanout could
not, for example, be used to simulate a new /dev/input device. Demand
Peripherals gets around this problem by sending lines of ASCII text that
are terminated by a newline. If you need multibyte transfers, you could
add an ioctl() to fanout that sets the byte count for atomic reads from
the data source.
</p><p>
If you like the simplicity of /dev/proxy but really need ioctl()
support, you can add it to the proxy driver by allocating two minor
numbers for each proxy device. Use the even-numbered minor numbers for
the data interface and the odd-numbered minor numbers for the ioctl()
interface. Your configuration might look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mknod /dev/proxy_data c $PROXYMAJOR 0
mknod /dev/proxy_ctrl c $PROXYMAJOR 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Your additions to the proxy driver would have to serialize the data
passed to and from the ioctl() request, and your user-space driver d&aelig;mon
would have to open both devices to handle the ioctl() requests separately
from the data stream requests.
</p><p>
We used fanout and proxy to add device drivers for an FPGA-based
robotic controller, but they are actually fairly generic. What Linux
problems can you solve using fanout and proxy?
