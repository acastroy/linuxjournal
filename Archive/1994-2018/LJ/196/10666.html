Open source and education: a match made in computer heaven.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5f580.0x1057460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Computer Science (CS) education, for some time now, has been accused of
being outdated and failing to capture the hearts and minds of the next
generation of leaders and innovators. Rekindling the pioneer spirit and
excitement of the hacking culture of the 1970s and 1980s requires flexible
and accessible open hardware and software in an environment that promotes
experimentation and collaboration. Although the software community has a
long history of building and sharing such platforms, open and flexible
hardware platforms have been few and far between. Oregon State University
developed the Oregon State Wireless Active Learning Device (OSWALD)
to help close this loop. The OSWALD is an open, Linux-based, ultra-mobile
personal computer incorporating many of today's new technologies and
gives students and enthusiasts full access to both its hardware
and software. Based on discussions with the OSWALD development team,
this article provides a brief overview of the platform and explores the
lessons learned in re-inventing computer science through open source.

Open Source and the State of Computer Science Education</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most frustrating challenges CS educators face today is
convincing the next generation of students that room still exists for
innovation and making a difference in computing. With the advancement
of computing and its proliferation into most aspects of our lives, many
prospective students feel computing is &ldquo;a solved problem&rdquo;, that the days
of innovation and chances to make a significant contribution have passed. We
are victims of our own success. The rapid spread of cheap hardware and
polished applications had removed one of the most compelling reasons
many have had for studying computer science: the need to scratch our own
itch. As a consequence, CS enrollment has dropped for more than a decade.
</p><p>
It doesn't help that the CS curriculum has, in many ways, failed to keep
up with changes. Here I refer to the core curriculum, not the electives or
advanced courses, where we often see a much richer and up-to-date set of
topics. Little has changed in the core curriculum during the last 15 years
short of programming language choices. In all fairness, the body of CS
has been growing tremendously, and the fundamentals are still fundamental,
but academia has failed to make sure this core stays relevant and visible
to current and future students.
</p><p>
Open source provides a unique opportunity to help us bridge this
gap. In an article titled &ldquo;Computer Science Education in the 21st
Century&rdquo;, David A. Patterson, former president of ACM and Pardee
Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley, explained that open source
provided unique opportunities for injecting realism and relevance
into the classroom. One of Patterson's laments is that students can
easily go through their undergraduate education without real exposure
to computing. Students rarely read other people's code, and sharing of
code is often the same as cheating. The largest codebase students might
see is a few thousand lines of their code written over a period of 
6&ndash;12 months with, at most, a half-dozen other students. This code
will not evolve or be maintained. In all likelihood, it will be discarded
as soon as the class ends. Open source allows educators to change this
dynamic, opening a window into the chaotic and complex, yet realistic
world of software development. A place where code is designed and written
by many, and the context, metadata, discussion and collaboration required
is available to all. It's a unique resource for educators to present an
invaluable opportunity to students to learn real skills. Oregon State
University has been busy developing curriculum centered on open source,
and it is aware of how to navigate its sometimes discouraging waters.
</p><p>
Dr Carlos Jensen, an assistant professor at Oregon State University and
driving force behind this project, explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Students do not want to
re-invent the wheel, and can be intimidated by the quantity and quality of
easily available software. Many of us learned how to program by writing
small programs designed to meet some need other software couldn't. Some
of us attained glory by writing something our fellow students also found
useful and would circulate. Today, chances are, there is already an
app to meet most needs, and students often see joining large open-source
communities as their only choice to make a difference in computing. It
can be a daunting and intimidating prospect for someone learning how to
code, and therefore, open source must be introduced in the right context.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5f580.0x1057fb8"></a>
The OSWALD</h2></div></div><p>
To be true to this open-source model, the OSWALD development team decided
to take this model and apply it to both hardware and software. For students to learn
through open source, it's important that this extend all the way down to
the hardware platforms they use, which is still surprisingly difficult
to do.
</p><p>
The OSWALD is a handheld ultra-mobile PC designed to be accessible and
affordable to students, while incorporating many new technologies seen in
the mobile device market. The OSWALD is an open platform meant to open
up the creative space for student projects. With its relatively novel
form factor, students are given the opportunity to explore and push the
boundaries of computing again, as well as explore contemporary interaction
techniques through hardware, such as a touchscreen and accelerometer. The
device was carefully designed to balance power and performance with cost,
equivalent to a college textbook.
</p><p>
We could have encouraged the use of Netbooks running open-source
software. The price point and capabilities of these machines make them a
tempting alternative to full laptops. The form factor was important to
us for this reason. The device is an auxiliary computing device rather
than a desktop or laptop replacement. Students treat their primary
computing devices with care; this is where they store their media and
do their work. The primary computing platform, therefore, is not a place
where we would expect to see a lot of experimentation. The relatively
little software customized for this form factor is a benefit to the
OSWALD. A student might create or port an interesting piece of software
and share it with another student who will appreciate it. With this in
mind, students will have a long list of desired features to bring to
the platform and are motivated to create better software.
</p><p>
The biggest challenges to building an open platform, such as the
OSWALD, are the costs associated with manufacturing it, especially on
a small scale. Because this is a university project, the devices basically
are manufactured for students' own consumption at this point. For instance,
though there is no shortage of companies that can assemble and test these
devices, the devices are built by undergraduates. This means there
will be positive and negative outcomes. There will be quality issues,
and the devices take longer to assemble, but there is a relatively large
number of freshman and sophomores working with the devices
and, in the process, learning and gaining the confidence to work with
computer hardware. Ben Goska, an undergraduate in Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science and chief hardware developer elaborates: &ldquo;We only
make 300 OSWALDs in a build run. Talking to developers is tricky because
most manufacturers are used to numbers in the thousands. We are building
these by hand.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The hardware is also not as optimized as one would expect with commercial
support, but there is intentionally a fair bit of redundancy. As
Dr Jensen explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I'm a user interface researcher. What I want
to do is use this device to help students understand the trade-offs
between different interface techniques. When you pick a phone, or a
mobile device, typically you will have an interaction method chosen
for you. For the iPhone, everything is touch. There is no way of doing
anything other than by touching the screen. This is a very intuitive,
slick interface, but there are instances where it's just a dumb idea. For
a certain application, having a separate touch area makes more sense,
or a rocker switch, or a joystick. We provide all of these because part of
what I want to do is have a device that lets students experiment with
all aspects of computing, including the interface. That's the reason for
its flexibility. This is just one example of how, for a very specific
type of course or curriculum, you can take advantage of that type of
flexibility. Even if we didn't have all three capabilities built in to
the device, I could plug in a mouse or a joystick, essentially anything,
through a USB port that would give me that flexibility, and students can
then learn their pros and cons.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
At the university level, a cheap and open embedded computing platform can
be valuable in multiple ways. At Oregon State University, the Physics
Department has taken OSWALDs and ripped them apart to control scientific
instruments. The robotics club uses the OSWALD board to control their
Mars rover and aerial vehicles. The OSWALD is more robust than a laptop;
it has a solid-state drive, which makes it durable. Dr Jensen explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We're envisioning, as we go forward, people will be taking some of these
devices, taking them apart and refashioning them into whatever they need
them to be, whether it's a mini Web server, file server, media server or
whether it's embedded in other things. It has enough processing power
to do that, and it has very low energy requirements, which make it ideal
for embedding in many different applications. It's a general-purpose
computing solution for your home market.

Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>
On the software side, the choice of operating system was much
clearer. Linux is a real operating system; it's not a toy. Students
take it seriously and see the long-term benefits of learning Linux in
depth. Students also benefit from joining Linux's rich open community,
where newbies can find guidance and plenty of resources. From a
development standpoint, Linux supports many types of software and devices,
so it has simplified development. On the downside, little development
has occurred on Linux for handheld devices, but this also means students still
can make meaningful contributions with relatively modest effort.
</p><p>
Embracing Linux also differentiates the OSWALD from the many media player
devices out here, like as the iPod Touch. Although many of these platforms
offer a sleeker design and an attractive price point, development for
these devices is difficult, as vendors either lock their platforms
or apply stringent IP restrictions. In this consideration, the OSWALD
has been designed with the flexibility needed to support a wide
range of classes. Two USB ports were critical in meeting this design
requirement. This component extends the platform in any number of
directions, something that no current media player platform allows you
to do. With Linux as a foundation, if someone has written a driver for
it, the OSWALD can support it. This gives it great flexibility in terms
of curriculum design. In freshman courses, students use the OSWALD to
control small robots and sensors. In graphics classes, USB cameras enable
simple image recognition, and the built-in networking allows students
to design P2P protocols as part of their networking classes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf5f580.0x1051448"></a>
The Future of the OSWALD</h2></div></div><p>
A university designing a UMPC like the OSWALD relies on the benevolence
and support of both hardware and software partners. To stay on the upside
of technological change, the OSWALD developers need to work with the
Linux community to make sure their changes and needs are met. Tim Harder, a graduate student in Electrical and Computer
Engineering and lead software developer for the OSWALD, puts it like this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In open source, you
have a lot of updates because a lot of people are working on different
things. Currently, we use OpenEmbedded to create the BitBake files
needed to create our custom Linux distribution, but an important fix
to help us move forward is to find a development environment with rich
contributions. We want to have flexibility as well as the high configurability
that something like Gentoo provides. Gentoo packages more software for
us, and we can take advantage of that.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Moving to a bigger development
community, such as Gentoo, will minimize risks in the future.
</p><p>
On the hardware side, fortune smiles with positive support from a
number of chip companies who have provided their chips free of charge,
at a reduced rate or subsidized the build process. These include Texas
Instruments, Tektronix, Intel Corporation and the National Science
Foundation. Their support for this device comes from OSU's belief that
the OSWALD will help train better engineers and programmers, but also
because these partners believe in a substantial future demand for people
trained in UMPC and embedded platform development.
</p><p>
Currently, the OSWALD's biggest challenge is broadening the
program. Manufacturing hardware for a small community is expensive and
risky, and the long-term costs may outweigh the benefits. Therefore,
scaling up demand to other universities and even enthusiasts is the key
to this devices' success. Right now, the OSWALD is available to students
and a handful of friends. OSU, like many universities, is not set up
for large-scale manufacturing or distribution. It will have to
think up ways, as an Open Source community, to support these types of
educational efforts in the future.
