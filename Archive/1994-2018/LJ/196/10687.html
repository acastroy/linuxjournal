Using an inexpensive wireless router, you can build a
file server, a print server and even a media server.
Plus, you can put all of those together 
and build the network device that does what <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> want.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x176c580.0x1864300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
OpenWrt provides an environment for building custom, Linux kernel-based
firmware for a variety of embedded devices. Originally targeting the
Linksys WRT54G series of routers, OpenWrt now provides support for a
wide range of devices, including Openmoko mobile phones and routers from
Linksys, NETGEAR and D-Link. This article focuses on the Linksys
WRT160NL router, which I chose because of its support for 802.11n
wireless networking, its USB connectivity and its reasonable price. Within
this device's 8MB of Flash and 32MB of RAM, I explain how to fit a Kerberos
authentication server, LDAP directory server, NFS file server, print
server and iTunes-compatible media server.
</p><p>
In addition to the Linksys WRT160NL router, you'll need an external USB
hard drive, a USB printer, a USB hub, a build workstation and a custom-built
console cable. To help build the console cable, You'll also need a continuity tester
(often available as a function of a multimeter). The first two items are
available for a total of less than $200. Any USB printer should suffice,
as long as your network clients support it. The build workstation should
be running an up-to-date Linux distribution. Finally, the console cable
is a modified Nokia DKU-5 connectivity cable; this type of cable has
a USB connection and embedded USB-to-serial adapter. In this article, I use
the example.com domain, someuser user account and server.local
router hostname. You should replace these three items with your own names.
</p><p>
This project has seven steps: preparing the build workstation,
downloading the OpenWrt build environment, configuring and building a
firmware image, installing a firmware image onto the WRT160NL, configuring
the external USB disk, performing a post-installation configuration of
the WRT160NL and configuring a network client. In addition, this article
describes how to rescue a misconfigured WRT160NL using the console
cable. If you find your router will not boot at any time while following
these steps, skip ahead to that final section.
</p><p>
The first step to building a firmware image using OpenWrt is preparing
your build workstation. OpenWrt requires that gcc, g++, binutils, patch,
bzip2, flex, bison, make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, the glibc headers,
the libz headers, the ncurses headers and the perl-XML-parser are installed
on the build workstation. All major distributions provide packages for
these items, although the package names may be slightly different from
the upstream titles.
</p><p>
Once you have installed all of the requisite packages on your build
workstation, download OpenWrt using the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
svn co -r 20526 svn://svn.openwrt.org/openwrt/trunk
</pre>
</p><p>
(Before downloading OpenWrt, you may want to check if a newer
version is available and substitute its revision number in the -r option.)
This creates a directory named trunk in the current working directory.
Enter this directory with <tt  >cd trunk</tt>.
Inside, you'll see the core OpenWrt build system. Additional
packages are provided by what OpenWrt calls feeds. Pull in the feeds
provided by the default configuration by executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./scripts/feeds update
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, complete the installation of the files required to
build your optional packages with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./scripts/feeds install krb5-server \
                        openldap-server \
                        nfs-kernel-server \
                        p910nd \
                        mt-daapd \
                        ntpd
</pre>
</p><p>
The third step is to configure your firmware and build an image containing
it. The OpenWrt build environment is similar to many BSD ports systems,
MacPorts or Gentoo Linux in that it allows users to define a list of
packages that the system will download and compile. Unlike these systems'
general use, OpenWrt often must cross-compile its packages. For example,
although my build workstation has an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, the
WRT160NL router has an MIPS32 processor. As a result, before downloading
and compiling general-purpose packages from source, OpenWrt downloads
and builds a cross compiler and other build tools from source.
</p><p>
OpenWrt provides a configuration system that is very similar to the
Linux kernel's and can be invoked with the command <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt>. You
can navigate the menu-based configuration tool using the arrow keys and
select submenus by pressing Enter. Activate an item with the Y key, or in
the case of a series of choices, with Enter. Conversely, pressing N deactivates
an item. Press the Esc key to return to a previous menu screen.
</p><p>
Within the configuration menu provided by the <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt> command,
first select Target System and choose the Atheros AR71xx/AR7240/AR913x
option. Set the Target Profile to Linksys WRT160NL. In the Target
Images submenu, ensure that only squashfs is activated.
</p><p>
Activate Advanced configuration options (for developers), and press
Enter while this option is highlighted. Select Toolchain options, and
press Enter again. Deactivate Build/install c++ compiler and libstdc++,
because none of the packages for this example build require a C++ environment.
</p><p>
Return to the main menu using the Esc key.
Select Base System, and then block-mount and block-hotplug.
</p><p>
Return to the main menu and select Network. Activate Filesystem,
nfs-kernel-server; Time Synchronization, ntpd; Printing, p910nd;
howl-mdnsresponder and openldap-server.
</p><p>
Return to the main menu and select Kernel Modules. Activate
Filesystems, kmod-fs-ext3 and USB Support, kmod-usb-printer and
kmod-usb-storage.
</p><p>
Return to the main menu, select Extra Packages, and activate krb5-server.
</p><p>
Return to the main menu, select Sound, and activate
mt-daapd. Finally, Esc out of the configuration tool, ensuring that
you save your configuration when prompted.
</p><p>
Now that your OpenWrt build is configured, execute the command <tt  >make
V=99</tt> to build the firmware image. This process takes a long time
to complete because OpenWrt is compiling the build environment itself,
followed by a Linux kernel and all of the firmware's programs. More than
likely, this will take several hours.
</p><p>
The result of the build process is a firmware image stored at
bin/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-wrt160nl-squashfs.bin. You may install the
OpenWrt firmware onto your router using Linksys' firmware upgrade tool,
assuming you have not already replaced Linksys' default firmware. The Linksys
firmware provides a Web-based configuration (Figure 1). The
Linksys firmware has a default IP address of 192.168.1.1, a default
user name of &ldquo;admin&rdquo; and a default password of
&ldquo;admin&rdquo;. After configuring
your build workstation by adding it to the 192.168.1.0 network, point
your browser to 192.168.1.1. Click Administration and then Firmware
Upgrade. Finally, click Choose File, and select the firmware image
you just built, namely openwrt-ar71xx-wrt160nl-squashfs.bin. Follow the
directions on the screen to replace Linksys' firmware with the OpenWrt
firmware. Restart the router once the upgrade process is complete.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10687f1.large.jpg"><img src="10687f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Firmware Upgrade Utility
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you have installed your firmware on the router, it's an
appropriate time to focus your attention on the USB disk that will serve
as the router's data store. Connect the disk to your build workstation.
You're
going to create two partitions on the disk, one 64MB swap partition and one
filesystem partition spanning the rest of the disk. You can do this 
with the following parted commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ parted /dev/sdX
 (parted) mklabel msdos
 (parted) mkpart primary 0 64
 (parted) mkpart primary ext3 64 -0
 (parted) quit
$ mkswap /dev/sdX1
$ mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdX2
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember to replace the X in /dev/sdX with the correct letter for
the newly connected drive on your system.
Finally, create a directory skeleton as follows (assuming /mnt is an
unused mountpoint):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt
$ mkdir -p /mnt/Storage/Music /mnt/home /mnt/mt-daapd
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, copy your music library to /mnt/Storage/Music.
</p><p>
One final step remains before you turn your attention to your
clients. The final step on the router is the post-install configuration.
Connect the newly initialized disk, the hub and the printer to your router,
and restart the router with the router connected to your build workstation
but not yet connected to a public network. Ensure that your workstation
is configured to obtain an IP address using DHCP. Once the router has
finished starting, connect to it using <tt  >telnet
192.168.1.1</tt>. Change the
root password using <tt  >passwd</tt>. Once this is complete, the router will no
longer accept telnet connections. Instead, you will connect using secure
shell: <tt  >ssh root@192.168.1.1</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that you've logged in to the router, let's pause and address an issue
you may be wondering about: the next firmware upgrade. Once the OpenWrt firmware has been installed,
you can no longer use the Linksys firmware upgrade tool that you used
previously. You will perform future firmware installations using an
OpenWrt-provided command-line tool. First, use the
<tt  >scp</tt> command
to copy a firmware image to the router's /tmp directory. Then, 
log in to the router, and execute <tt  >mtd -r write
&lt;path-to-image&gt; firmware</tt>.
</p><p>
Continuing work at the router's command prompt, now let's create nine
configuration files. The first file configures the router's hostname
and timezone, /etc/config/system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config system
    option hostname server.local
    option timezone  UTC
</pre>
</p><p>
The next three files configure the router's network parameters. First,
you'll configure the router's Ethernet devices. The following
configuration will cause all five Ethernet interfaces to be bridged
to perform switching on one network, 192.168.1.0. The configuration
sets the router's IP address to 192.168.1.2 (this is a change from the
default, 192.168.1.1). This configuration assumes that routing between
the 192.168.1.0 and upstream networks and Internet DNS resolution will
be performed by another device (for example, a DSL device) with an IP
address of 192.168.1.1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/config/network:

config interface loopback
    option ifname  lo
    option proto   static
    option ipaddr  127.0.0.1
    option netmask 255.0.0.0

config interface lan
    option ifname "eth0 eth1"
    option type    bridge
    option proto   static
    option ipaddr  192.168.1.2
    option netmask 255.255.255.0
    option dns     192.168.1.1
    option gateway 192.168.1.1
</pre>
</p><p>
The WRT160NL has a total of five Ethernet ports, but the configuration option
above shows two:

<pre     class="programlisting">
option ifname "eth0 eth1"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is correct. The WRT160NL's four LAN ports perform switching functions and are
collectively referred to by the Linux kernel as eth0. The kernel
refers to the single WAN port as eth1. This configuration
bridges all five Ethernet ports together to perform switching functions
on one subnet. It also configures the switch to act as a host, assigned
the IP address 192.168.1.2. After applying this configuration, all five
Ethernet ports are equivalent switch ports.
</p><p>
Next, configure the router's wireless interface:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/etc/config/wireless:

config wifi-device radio0
    option type     mac80211
    option channel  5
    option macaddr  &lt;MAC-ADDRESS&gt;
    option hwmode   11ng
    list ht_capab   HT40-
    list ht_capab   SHORT-GI-40
    list ht_capab   DSSS_CCK-40

config wifi-iface
    option device   radio0
    option network  lan
    option mode     ap
    option ssid     &lt;SSID&gt;
    option encryption psk2
    option key      &lt;WPA2 KEY&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Configure the DHCP service by writing /etc/config/dhcp:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config dhcp lan
    option interface    lan
    option start        100
    option limit        150
    option leasetime    24h
    # GW, DNS:
    option dhcp_option "3,192.168.1.1 6,192.168.1.1"

config dhcp wan
    option interface    wan
    option ignore       1

config dnsmasq
    option leasefile   '/tmp/dhcp.leases'
    option resolvfile  '/tmp/resolv.conf.auto'
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, remove the default fstab using <tt  >rm
/etc/config/fstab</tt>, because all
mounts and swap space will be set up dynamically by the hotplug system.
</p><p>
Configure the disk's two shared directories using /etc/exports:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/mnt/sda2/Storage *(fsid=0,rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,sync)
/mnt/sda2/home *(rw,insecure,no_subtree_check,sync)
</pre>
</p><p>
Configure Kerberos by creating /etc/krb5.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[libdefaults]
    default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    dns_lookup_kdc = false
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    forwardable = yes

[realms]
    EXAMPLE.COM = {
        kdc = localhost:88
        admin_server = localhost:749
        default_domain = local
    }

[domain_realm]
    .local = EXAMPLE.COM
    local = EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
</p><p>
OpenLDAP's configuration file is /etc/openldap/slapd.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">

include    /etc/openldap/schema/core.schema
include    /etc/openldap/schema/cosine.schema
include    /etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
include    /etc/openldap/schema/nis.schema
include    /etc/openldap/schema/autofs.schema

allow bind_v2

pidfile    /var/run/openldap/slapd.pid
argsfile   /var/run/openldap/slapd.args

database   ldif
directory "/etc/openldap/ldif"
suffix    "dc=example,dc=com"
rootdn    "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com"
rootpw    "&lt;PASSWORD&gt;"

</pre>
</p><p>
Configure the media server, mt-daapd, by writing to /etc/mt-daapd.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">

web_root        /usr/share/mt-daapd/admin-root
port            3689
admin_pw        &lt;PASSWORD&gt;
db_dir          /mnt/sda2/mt-daapd
mp3_dir         /mnt/sda2/Storage/Music
servername      server.local
runas           nobody
playlist        /etc/mt-daapd.playlist
extensions      .mp3,.m4a,.m4p

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, use /etc/config/p910nd to configure printer sharing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config p910nd
    option device        /dev/lp0
    option port          0
    option bidirectional 1
    option enabled       1
</pre>
</p><p>
Because OpenWRT sometimes starts services before the kernel initializes the
USB subsystem, you need to make one last modification.
Edit /etc/rc.d/S50mt-daapd and add <tt  >sleep 5</tt> as the first line in the start()
function. This ensures that mt-daapd does not start until the kernel
is aware of the USB disk containing your media files.
</p><p>
Reboot the router to ensure all configuration changes take effect.
</p><p>
The next step is to initialize the router's Kerberos database. Log back
in to the router using <tt  >ssh root@192.168.1.2</tt>. Initialize the account
database using the command <tt  >kadmin.local</tt>, which provides an interactive
interface:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ kadmin.local
  &gt; add_principal someuser
  &gt; exit
</pre>
</p><p>
Returning to the build workstation, let's initialize the LDAP
database. First, create a file named example.com.ldif with the following
contents, a database defining a user account and automount configuration
in LDIF format:


<pre     class="programlisting">

dn: dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organization
objectClass: dcObject
o: Example Organization
dc: example

dn: ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: people

dn: ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: organizationalUnit
ou: group

dn: cn=ldapusers,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: posixGroup
objectClass: top
cn: ldapusers
userPassword:: WFhYWA==
gidNumber: 1002

dn: uid=someuser,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
uid: someuser
cn: Some User
objectClass: account
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: top
userPassword:: WFhYWA==
loginShell: /bin/bash
uidNumber: 1100
gidNumber: 1002
homeDirectory: /home/someuser
gecos: Some User

dn: automountMapName=auto_master,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: automountMap
automountMapName: auto_master

dn: automountKey=/home,automountMapName=auto_master,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: automount
automountKey: /home
automountInformation: auto.home

dn: automountMapName=auto.home,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: automountMap
automountMapName: auto.home

dn: automountKey=*,automountMapName=auto.home,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: top
objectClass: automount
automountKey: *
automountInformation: server.local:/mnt/sda2/home/&amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
Next, load the file into the LDAP database on the router using: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
ldapadd -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f example.com.ldif
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally,
return to the router and create someuser's home directory, <tt  >mkdir
/var/sda2/home/someuser</tt>, and then do <tt  >chown
1100:1002</tt>. Notice that the UID:GID
arguments to the chown command match those assigned to someuser in the
LDIF file above. Now you can connect the router to your real network.
</p><p>
To add additional users, review the fifth block in the LDIF file above,
tailor it for each user and add them using <tt  >ldapadd</tt>. Also, create each
user's home directory as before.
</p><p>
Your router now should be fully functional, so it is time to configure
the clients. Several existing articles document how to configure a
client to operate in LDAP and Kerberos environments (see Resources). You may configure
your clients by editing configuration files, or you can investigate your
distribution's administrative tools. 
</p><p>
One difficult point I've encountered has to do with the LDAP schema used
by the automounter. Different UNIX flavors use different schemas. My
instructions use the schema employed by Mac OS X, because it also
is supported on Fedora. In order to instruct the Fedora automounter to
use this schema, write the following to /etc/sysconfig/autofs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MASTER_MAP_NAME="auto_master"
TIMEOUT=300
BROWSE_MODE="no"
USE_MISC_DEVICE="yes"

# Mac OS X 10.5-compatible schema:
MAP_OBJECT_CLASS="automountMap"
ENTRY_OBJECT_CLASS="automount"
MAP_ATTRIBUTE="automountMapName"
ENTRY_ATTRIBUTE="automountKey"
VALUE_ATTRIBUTE="automountInformation"
</pre>
</p><p>
Other distributions may configure the automounter differently. If the
automounter is configured to use the appropriate schema, it will
learn of the NFS-provided home share from the LDAP entry you created earlier
and mount users' home directories on-demand.
</p><p>
Refer to your client system's documentation for instructions covering
how to connect to the network printer. Your OpenWrt firmware will share
an attached USB printer using the HP Jetdirect protocol. This protocol
is supported by Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and many other operating systems.
</p><p>
Your OpenWrt device's music share is accessible by iTunes, Rhythmbox
and any other media player that supports the DAAP protocol. Compatible
players usually will display the share as an option alongside their
local music library list.
</p><p>
What if you install a defective firmware, and the router is left in a state
that will not boot? This is where your console cable comes in. Figure
2 shows a completed console cable next to an unmodified DKU-5. There
are three points on the WRT160NL to which you can connect a console cable.
The first are two identical sets of leads within the WAN and LAN 4 RJ45
sockets, opposite the Ethernet leads. The second is a five-post connector
on the WRT160NL's motherboard. In order to use the latter interface, you
have to open the WRT160NL's case, which voids the device's warranty.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10687f2.large.jpg"><img src="10687f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Console Cable
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 3 provides a picture of a Nokia DKU-5 cable connector. The other
side of the cable has a USB connector. Cut the cable in half so that
most of its length is on the USB connector side. Now, expose the six
leads on the Nokia connector side. Use a continuity tester to identify
which four of the six leads correspond to the functional pins noted in
Figure 3. Note the insulator color of the lead connected to each pin. Now
focus your attention to the other half of the cable, the one with the
USB connector. Expose the four leads matching the colors noted earlier.
Connect each of these leads to the four of five binding posts labeled
in Figure 4, ensuring that the lead and post functions match. You may
connect them using a PCB connector, hook to pico hook jumpers or a more
primitive technique.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10687f3.large.jpg"><img src="10687f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. Router's Console Interface
</p></div></div><p>
Connect the USB connector of the console cable to your build
workstation. Install a serial terminal emulator, such as minicom, on your
build workstation and run the program. Configure the emulator to use
eight data bits, no parity bit and one stop bit. Select 115200 baud. Boot
the router and observe the emulator console. You should see the router
print diagnostic information through the console interface. Pay close
attention to the messages being printed through the console, and press
a key when the U-Boot bootloader prompts you to &ldquo;Hit any key to stop
autoboot.&rdquo; You should see the U-Boot command prompt,

This article demonstrates a technique for providing Kerberos, LDAP,
network filesystem, print and media services using a Linksys WRT160NL
wireless router. The result is a low-cost network server for the home
or small office. OpenWrt has a wide range of packages available, so
there is potential for many other solutions to be developed around this
capable platform. For example, Samba could allow tight integration
with Windows clients. Another option is Netatalk, which provides native
Mac OS X file sharing, including integration with Apple's Time Machine
backup software. Linux, open-source applications and popular network
hardware like the Linksys WRT160NL provide a solid basis for developing
innovative devices.
