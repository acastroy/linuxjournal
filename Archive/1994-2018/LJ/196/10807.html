<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #196, August 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan Cameron</b></span> had a bit of a disappointment when he tried to
introduce a new subsystem for <span   class="bold"><b>ambient light
sensors</b></span>. His reasoning was
not poor. There were several existing drivers for ambient light
sensors, and they were all scattered throughout different subsystems.
His creation of a new subsystem amounted to little more than gathering
those drivers together and writing up a little documentation. But,
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> vetoed the whole plan, saying that ambient light
sensors essentially were input devices and shouldn't be given their
own subsystem. So, Jonathan's new <span   class="bold"><b>ALS
subsystem</b></span> may not come to pass,
but presumably folks now are working on gathering those drivers
together into a saner organization.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Constantine Shulyupin</b></span> is soliciting input
on how to update his <span   class="bold"><b>map of
the Linux kernel</b></span>, located at <a href="http://www.makelinux.net/kernel_map" target="_self">www.makelinux.net/kernel_map</a>. It's
a high-level view of the overall structure of the kernel, complete
with links into <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com" target="_self">lxr.free-electrons.com</a>, where the various
identifiers are defined and tracked.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has been maintaining
the <span   class="bold"><b>staging tree</b></span>, but
recently he started falling behind in considering patch submissions.
<span   class="bold"><b>Joe Perches</b></span> asked why, and it turned out Greg had been giving
presentations, writing articles and moving houses, with the result
that there was now a 600-patch backlog. Various folks discussed
possible changes to Greg's standard process, which included him just
looking at patches as they came in and making decisions about them.
Joe volunteered to help out. Greg was reluctant to change his
work flow, especially since the problem had been the result of a
confluence of events, but he did take Joe up on his offer and asked
him to handle the incoming patch requests, while Greg continued to
plow through the backlog.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Phillip Lougher</b></span> hit a snag with <span   class="bold"><b>SquashFS</b></span>. He tried to update some
very ugly code, and Linus Torvalds asked him to fix the ugliness
first. Now Phillip is stuck with this thorny batch of ugliness
that touches a number of different architectures, which aren't
directly related to the SquashFS Project, but which he can't avoid
working on if he wants his SquashFS patches to make it into the
kernel. <span   class="bold"><b>Tim Bird</b></span> recently asked about the status of SquashFS, and
that's basically what Phillip told him in reply. The patches will
have to wait until Phillip finds the time to delve into those messy
include files.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Plumber's Conference</b></span> will be
held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, this
year, November 3&ndash;5. The overarching theme will be projects that span
multiple interfaces, and thus, will involve groups of developers who might
not normally work directly with one another. The format will be a set
of brainstorming &ldquo;tracks&rdquo;, where folks will try to figure out the best
way to deal with these various cross-project issues. Check out
<a href="http://wiki.linuxplumbersconf.org/2010:topics" target="_self">wiki.linuxplumbersconf.org/2010:topics</a> for the current list of
&ldquo;tracks&rdquo; being considered.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>SCST generic SCSI target subsystem</b></span> has
migrated from using <span   class="bold"><b>ProcFS</b></span>
for configuration to using <span   class="bold"><b>SysFS</b></span>. The new interface is documented in
README files in the source tree. <span   class="bold"><b>Vladislav
Bolkhovitin</b></span> announced the
change recently, adding that the old ProcFS interface was now
officially obsolete, which means that developers maintaining drivers,
dev handlers and management utilities should start updating their
code, with the expectation that the ProcFS interface will be going
away at some point. The way this typically would work is that all active
maintainers would migrate their code, and then someone would try to remove
the SCST ProcFS interface. Next, someone would come out of the woodwork
to say there's this or that driver that breaks, and then there would be
another waiting period. The process would repeat until it became
clear that any remaining code using the ProcFS interface is either
completely unmaintained or has no users at all. Then the ProcFS
interface will be removed, and possibly the projects still depending
on it might be removed from the kernel as well.

<h2 class="title">Android: Too Much of a Good Thing?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #196, August 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Android is everywhere. Really. It runs phones, tablets, and recently, I
even saw it running on an iPhone. Just a few years ago, that would have
thrilled
me to no end. Truthfully, it still does, but I'm more skeptical now.
See, two years ago, Linux was everywhere on Netbooks. I thought it was
a big break&mdash;Linux finally hit the mainstream.

</p><p>
But, vendor customization and &ldquo;dumbing down&rdquo; made Linux look like an
inconsistent kludge rather than a free and powerful choice. So far,
Android looks fairly consistent across hardware. So far, many apps work,
regardless of the Android version your device supports. Hopefully, vendors
will see the mistakes made with Netbooks, and keep their
&ldquo;branding&rdquo;
to a minimum. There are many ways phone vendors and wireless carriers
could mess up our world domination efforts. Again.
</p><p>
Dear Vendors, please don't try to sell more phones by adding proprietary
software on top of Android. If you add software, contribute it back to
the community. If you want to sell more phones, make better phones than
your competition. (Please!)

<h2 class="title">What Hardware Do I Have?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #196, August 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Often you may not necessarily know what kind of
hardware you have&mdash;you may have a no-name box from a smaller
company or a used machine. This month, I present the tools you can
use to find out what you have installed.
</p><p>
First up is lshw. This utility LiSts HardWare (lshw). If
you run it as a regular user, it actually warns you to run it as
root. So go ahead and run <tt  >sudo lshw</tt>. You should see screens
of information for your system. The first section will be general
information and should look something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jbernard-eeepc            
    description: Notebook
    product: 700
    vendor: ASUSTeK Computer INC.
    version: 0129
    serial: EeePC-1234567890
    width: 32 bits
    capabilities: smbios-2.5 dmi-2.5 smp-1.4 smp
    configuration: boot=normal chassis=notebook 
    &#8618;cpus=1 uuid=XXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
</pre>
</p><p>
This is what I get when I run it on my little ASUS EeePC. Right away
you can find the manufacturer of this little beast (ASUSTeK), the
BIOS version (0129), and the fact that it's a 32-bit machine with one
CPU. More information is broken down into the following categories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
core
   firmware - motherboard and BIOS information
   cpu - CPU information
      cache - cache information
   memory - memory information
      bank - specific bank memory information
   pci - PCI bus information
      display - PCI display adapter
      multimedia - PCI audio adapter
      pci - other PCI devices
      network - PCI network adapter
   usb - USB devices
   ide - IDE information
      disk - individual disks
         volume - volumes on this disk
</pre>
</p><p>
For an idea on how much information is available, the main memory section shows this about my EeePC:

<pre     class="programlisting">
*-memory
     description: System Memory
     physical id: 1f
     slot: System board or motherboard
     size: 512MiB
   *-bank
        description: DIMM DDR2 Synchronous 400 MHz (2.5 ns)
        product: PartNum0
        vendor: Manufacturer0
        physical id: 0
        serial: SerNum0
        slot: DIMM0
        size: 512MiB
        width: 64 bits
        clock: 400MHz (2.5ns)
</pre>
</p><p>
This utility is basically an all-in-one tool that spits out everything
on your system in one go. But, what if you want information only about
specific subsystems in your machine? An entire suite of utilities exists 
for this, and they might be more useful when you need some
specific piece of information or want to do some system querying
in a script.
</p><p>
You may want to look at the CPU. The lscpu utility
provides output similar to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Architecture:          i686
CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit
CPU(s):                1
Thread(s) per core:    1
Core(s) per socket:    1
CPU socket(s):         1
Vendor ID:             GenuineIntel
CPU family:            6
Model:                 13
Stepping:              8
CPU MHz:               571.427
</pre>
</p><p>
From this, you can see the manufacturer, whether it's 32-bit or
64-bit, the exact version and model, as well as the current CPU frequency.
</p><p>
If you want to know whether your video card is supported by X11,
or whether you need to find a third-party driver, you can use
lspci. This utility gives a list of all the devices plugged
in to your PCI bus. The output looks something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 
 &#8618;Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 04)
00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation 
 &#8618;Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 04)
</pre>
</p><p>
This information shows that the video controller in my EeePC is
an Intel controller. So, if you wanted, you now could search Google with
this information to learn about your video card and how best to configure
it. If you want to see what USB devices are on your system, use
lsusb. On my EeePC, I have an SD card installed, and it shows up as this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0951:1606 Kingston Technology 
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're interested in the disk subsystem, you
can find out what your system has with the blkid utility. This
utility prints out all the available filesystems, with 
the following output format:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sda1: UUID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" TYPE="ext2" 
/dev/sda2: UUID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" TYPE="swap" 
/dev/sda3: UUID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" TYPE="ext2" 
/dev/sdb1: UUID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" TYPE="ext2" 
</pre>
</p><p>
With this utility, you can learn what devices are available and
what filesystems are being used on them. The associated UUIDs also
are available if you want to use them in the entries in /etc/fstab.
</p><p>
Now that you know what kind of hardware you have on your system, the last
thing to check is to see whether your kernel actually is using the available
hardware. On most modern distributions, the kernel is compiled to use
modules. You can check to see which modules are loaded by using the
lsmod command. You will get a list that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
agpgart                31788  2 drm,intel_agp
lp                      7028  0 
video                  17375  1 i915
output                  1871  1 video
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that the agpgart module has a size of 31788 bytes and is
used by the drm and intel_agp modules.
</p><p>
Now, hopefully, you can configure and optimize your hardware so that you get the most out of
it. If you find other utilities not covered here, I would love
to hear about them.

<h2 class="title">Autonomous Cars Running Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">
Anton
 
Borisov
</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #196, August 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This summer, two electric cars will be traveling from Milan, Italy, to
Shanghai, China, on an ancient silk route
(<a href="http://vislab.it/Projects/view/32/VisLab%27s_new_adventure_on_the_Silk_road" target="_self">vislab.it/Projects/view/32/VisLab%27s_new_adventure_on_the_Silk_road</a>).
The driving will be completely
autonomous, controlled by Linux recognition and processing software.
The cars are being developed at the Artificial Vision and Intelligent Systems Lab of
Parma University by
Alberto Broggi and his team. Read on for an interview with Alberto about the
project.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> You recently announced the Milan-Shanghai initiative. Could
you explain the main purpose behind it?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> We design driver-assistance systems
to help drivers and reduce
accidents (increasing road safety). With this trip, we
are pushing our technology to the limit and trying to give the vehicles
a lot of intelligence to be able to drive by themselves completely.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> Do you mean that with this trip you're trying to get as much
road statistics as possible?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> Not only that. The vehicle, instead of only helping the driver in some dangerous
situations, will fully manage itself (it will have full control of gas,
steering and brakes) for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>whole</em></span> trip. In other words, it will not
only be active for a given set of situations, but also for the whole 13,000km.
We also will record all the data, so we can play back the whole trip
many times once we return to Parma. In the end, we plan to
test other driving assistance systems in a huge number of completely
different situations (such as mountain, flat, hilly, traffic, no traffic, rain,
dust, off-road and so on).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> What organizations helped you design the car and supportive technologies?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> It's just us, thanks to a grant I received from the ERC (European
Research Council).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> So you've got an ordinary Fiat car, you
created supportive software, and
here it goes?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> No, we have electric vehicles
manufactured by Piaggio, an
Italian motor company. The vehicles we will use on the China trip
are electrical and will have a solar panel to power the electronic
pilot. Originally, we wanted to recharge the driving batteries with the
solar panel, but current technology is not mature enough. Therefore,
we are powering only the sensors, the PCs and the actuators (namely,
the whole automatic pilot). The vehicle we are using right now (but not the vehicle
that will travel to China) is called BRAiVE (<a href="http://www.braive.vislab.it" target="_self">www.braive.vislab.it</a>),
and it includes a superset of the technology that we will have on our
China vehicles. BRAiVE is a traditional petrol-based car.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10807carf1.large.jpg"><img src="10807carf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
A half-dozen cameras and sensors, and here's an automated
Linux vehicle.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> Elaborate on the vehicle's architecture&mdash;especially the software part of it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> The architecture is simple: seven
cameras, five laser scanners, GPS, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)&mdash;all connected to three Linux PCs.
The PCs get the data, process it
and send commands to actuators that drive the steering wheel, gas and
brakes. All the software was developed by us during the last 15 years. We have been
using this software for other challenges like the DARPA Grand Challenge
or Urban Challenge.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10807carf2.large.jpg"><img src="10807carf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Three Linux PCs process data and generate a 3-D representation
of the surrounding environment.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> The DARPA Challenge is
performed in dry and sunny places. Did
you try to run tests somewhere in more severe conditions, like in rain or snow?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> We did tests in 2006 at the US Yuma
base in Arizona (where we automated a
PLS vehicle) and in 2001 in Antarctica (we automated a snowcat that followed
tracks left by preceding vehicles). BRAiVE also works under light
rain. Heavy rain is indeed a problem (as is heavy fog or snow).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> How many prototypes had been developed before this roadrunner?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> Well, a good number! BRAiVE, TerraMax T2, Oshkosh PLS, Mini,
Hummer&mdash;just have a look at our prototypes page: <a href="http://vislab.it/Prototypes" target="_self">vislab.it/Prototypes</a>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> How did you come to use Linux?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> I have been using Linux since it was created! Linux is more stable than
Windows, and for these critical applications, it delivers the performance
we need.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> What flavor of Linux exactly do you
use, and how do you process data
(recognize video objects)&mdash;is this an HPC cluster or an ordinary PC?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> We started with Fedora 11, and we customized it to remove
all features (services and software packages) typical of a desktop
distribution, keeping only the minimum. We use Fluxbox as a window
manager and gcc-4.4.3, kdevelop-3.9.99, gdb-7.0.1 as a development
environment. We use normal PCs on a local LAN (Core 2 Duo T7100 at 1.8GHz
2MB Cache L2 FSB 800MHz, 1GB DDR2).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> What components were programmed by your
team and what has
been done by the Open Source community?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> The real substance of our work is visual recognition and data
processing, so my team has been busy with this in-house task for the
past 15 years. Environmental reconstruction is the most difficult task.
Once you have a 3-D representation of the surrounding environment, controlling
the vehicle is not very complex. Our software is written
in ISO C++, using some minimal additional open-source libraries like boost,
loki and wxWidgets.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10807carf3.large.jpg"><img src="10807carf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Driving conditions are recognized, so the vehicle continues its
way forward.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span>
What general obstacles can your vehicle bypass now, and what
obstacles can't it bypass yet?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> Any obstacle rising up from the road surface is
detected. We can't detect small obstacles. For example, curbs are not
always detected, but larger obstacles like pedestrians, vehicles and
small animals are detected. Technically, we can locate obstacles that
are sufficiently visible. Indeed, it takes time, and therefore, the system
wouldn't be able to work at speeds such as 200mph (we'd need to increase
our computer horsepower). Our electric vehicles run at slow speeds (the maximum speed
so far is 70km/h), so we have no problems. Other systems (hardware and
software) have been developed for other vehicles depending on their speed
(based on more penetrating sensors and faster processing).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> Where is such a technology (unmanned
driving) already demanded,
and in what spheres can you envision it will be useful to deploy?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> Definitely in the military field, but there's a huge demand in
the agricultural domain. Think about autonomous tractors that move
on the field automatically and work 24/7. And, we have been working
(and are currently working) with Caterpillar for a number of years now,
and they are interested in putting our technologies on their
mining vehicles. Besides, through all these years we've done a couple
auxiliary projects in aviation (project PEGASE), road construction
(project TOPCON) and many others (<a href="http://vislab.it/Projects" target="_self">vislab.it/Projects</a>).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> What stops them from using your technology right now?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> The environmental conditions are the most difficult challenge. We
are now working to adapt our algorithms to have them working on very
rough terrain, when the vehicle jumps on terrain bumps. Now we are able
to reconstruct the world in 3-D with two cameras in real time (10Hz)
and warn the driver about the presence of obstacles.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> Tell us about your team.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> All the people on my team are
engineers, almost all are PhDs and all of
us have an electrical/CS background.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anton:</b></span> You've got an alumni procedure. What qualifications do you expect
from a student joining your team to help further develop this prototype?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alberto:</b></span> Well, regarding this prototype, we
already are almost done (we leave
in less than three months). But for further projects (and we have plenty of
them!), the ideal candidate should be well motivated and should be able
to speak C++ fluently.

Just because your phone is running Linux (and let's hope it is),
that doesn't mean you can't talk to it with your Windows computer.
Droid Explorer is an open-source program that allows you to manage your
Android device in the same way that Windows Explorer allows you to manage
your local files.
</p><p>
Droid Explorer supports multiple devices, allows you to copy
files to and from your device easily, assists in applying system
updates, provides a shell window, allows you to
reboot into recovery mode, provides a package manager
to install/uninstall Android Packages (APK),
and it even lets you take a screenshot of your Android device.
And, that's just for starters.
</p><p>
Droid Explorer is written in C# for the .NET platform.
The current version is 0.8.4.3-Beta, and
it lives at <a href="http://de.codeplex.com" target="_self">de.codeplex.com</a>.
If you're a Mono programmer looking for a new project, the developer
is looking for someone to pitch in and help convert the UI to run on Mono.

<h2 class="title">HTML5, New Technology for Old Dogs</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #196, August 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Everyone (myself included) is excited about HTML5 and how it will allow
us to have richer content without proprietary plugins. Those who hate 
Adobe are excited about breaking away from Flash's dominance in the
Internet scene, but there's also a group of folks excited to have
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
option on the Internet multimedia scene&mdash;PowerPC users.

</p><p>
Open-source alternatives to Flash certainly exist, but unfortunately,
they don't work well on the majority of sites requiring Flash.
Because Adobe has never released a PPC version of Flash for Linux users,
those of us hoping to repurpose old Apple computers are left without any
answer when users ask about Flash&mdash;and Flash is everywhere!
</p><p>
Will HTML5 be the knight in shining armor for folks running Linux on G4 and
G5 computers? Will the Internet's transition to HTML5 take longer than
what the old PowerPC beasties have left in them to run? We'll see pretty soon.
I sure know I'd love to see our old Apple computers go back into service!

<h2 class="title">Ubuntu One: Selling Free</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #196, August 2010</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Love it or hate it, cloud computing is here to stay. Handfuls
of cloud services are being offered to computer users now, and like I've
mentioned before, Canonical is doing the same. As it matures, Ubuntu
One is beginning to roll more and more services into its feature set,
including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
File syncing (like Dropbox or Mobile Me for Macs).
</p></li><li><p>
Preference syncing (Mobile Me does a bit of this).
</p></li><li><p>
Contact syncing (Mobile Me and Google do this).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'm sure as more developers take advantage of the open-source client
for Ubuntu One, we'll see more and more applications take advantage
of syncing, backup and off-line functionality. Unfortunately, although
Canonical does offer free storage in the cloud for all users, that
doesn't mean all the features will be included in the free install.
Contact syncing, for example, uses Funambol's technology to sync with
mobile devices. That means Canonical has to pay for contact syncing
and must pass that fee to the end users.
</p><p>
Certainly paying for a service isn't a bad thing. The unfortunate part
is that Google <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> provide the vast majority of its services,
including syncing contacts on mobile devices, for free. Hopefully,
Canonical continues to keep the Ubuntu One API as open as possible, and
the community will come alongside them in order to provide features
that otherwise would cost money. I don't mind paying for storage in
the cloud, but paying for features that are provided free elsewhere is
a tough pill to swallow.

Each week or so, we're choosing a Linux distribution to highlight on
LinuxJournal.com. You'll see the Distro Spotlight on every page of
our Web site. We hope you'll visit often and add a comment to cheer
on your favorite, and also share your thoughts, tips and pitfalls. In the
process, we hope to present some lesser-known gems, although we'll still
celebrate crowd favorites. Be sure to check out the current pick,
and maybe you'll find your new favorite distribution. If you're up to
a fun challenge, try each distribution with us! Who doesn't love a
reason to re-install Linux?
