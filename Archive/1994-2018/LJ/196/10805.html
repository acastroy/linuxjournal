Tiny Ear Trainer&mdash;Color-Based Interval Training
(<a href="http://29a.ch/tinyeartrainer" target="_self">29a.ch/tinyeartrainer</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
An ongoing fascination of mine has been with
Synaesthesia: the crossing of senses, often leading to new and unique
perceptions in the mind of the &ldquo;Synaesthete&rdquo;. This is particularly
common among musicians (myself included) where individuals will
&ldquo;see&rdquo;
sound as color, possibly along with shapes, numbers, textures and so
on. It seems that Jonas Wagner has the concept of
linked sound and color quite firmly embedded in his own thoughts when it
comes to his program Tiny Ear Trainer&mdash;an ear training program designed
to teach you musical intervals with color association.
</p><p>
To quote the Web site:
&ldquo;Tiny Ear Trainer is a tiny piece of software that helps you
recognize musical intervals. Tiny Ear Trainer is free/open-source software
written for the GNU/Linux operating system.&rdquo; According to the Web
site, its features include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Associates colors to intervals.
</p></li><li><p>
Features learning mode, which plays intervals together with color and
name.
</p></li><li><p>
Plays harmonic or melodic intervals.
</p></li><li><p>
Uses fluidsynth/soundfonts for playback.
</p></li><li><p>
Uses Python/GTK.
</p></li><li><p>
Is tiny!
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10805f1.large.jpg"><img src="10805f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Tiny Ear Trainer takes the unique approach of teaching musical intervals
through color association.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10805f2.large.jpg"><img src="10805f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Making Tiny Ear Trainer work with JACK can be tricky for a first-timer, but
all you need to
do is connect &ldquo;fluidsynth&rdquo; with &ldquo;system&rdquo;, and you're away.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10805f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Tiny Ear Trainer gives you a number of useful options from which to choose (including a
learning mode), all in one concise package.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
i386-based Debian and Ubuntu users are in luck as a .deb file is
available at the Web site. For those using other systems, the obligatory
source tarball has been provided, but thankfully, the library requirements
are fairly modest and don't require anything particularly obscure for 
installation. The documentation says you need the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Python 2.6 (2.5 <span   class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span> work too and will require
simplejson).
</p></li><li><p>
PyGTK &gt;= 2.10.
</p></li><li><p>
fluidsynth.
</p></li><li><p>
A soundfont (fluid-soundfont-gm).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you have the needed libraries, download the latest tarball,
extract it, and open either a terminal or a file manager inside the new
folder. For those with a modern file manager like Nautlius or Dolphin,
you can install Tiny Ear Trainer simply by clicking on the file
install.sh, where you'll be prompted to enter a root password. For those
with a minimalist system, or those who prefer the manual method, you
can install it by entering the following command either as root or by
using sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the installation has finished, Tiny Ear Trainer should be in your
system menu, or you can run it by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tinyeartrainer
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Before going any further, I must warn you that Tiny Ear Trainer uses JACK.
That's not a bad thing, but it can be tricky getting it to work for
the uninitiated
(experienced JACK users will have no trouble at all and can skip
the next few paragraphs).
</p><p>
First, start JACK. Most people will be using the JACK Audio
Connection Kit, which usually can be found in your menu
as JACK Control, or you can run it from a terminal with the command
<tt  >qjackctl</tt>.
</p><p>
Now, click Start inside the GUI, and if you're lucky, it will start
straightaway. But, I wasn't lucky. This was the first time I'd used JACK
with this distro, and it came up with an error that I didn't understand
until I looked further into it. You may encounter this too. JACK usually
is set up by default to run in real time, generally coupled with a real-time
kernel. Real-time kernels crash constantly on my hardware, so that
wasn't an option for me. In this case, my only real choice was to disable
real time in the Settings tab in the Setup option.
</p><p>
Now that JACK is running, start Tiny Ear Trainer, and in the JACK Audio
Connection Kit,
click Connect on the bottom left, and open the Audio tab. In the left
pane under Readable Clients/Output Ports is the client fluidsynth,
and in the right pane under Writeable Clients/Input Ports is the client
system. Click on fluidsynth on the left and system on the right, and then
click the Connect button on the bottom left, and you should be good to go.
</p><p>
Back over to Tiny Ear Trainer&mdash;the program will be sitting idly with a
blank screen (presumably so you can connect to JACK in the meantime)
until you click the Play button. When you do, several notes will play in
a randomly chosen interval (for instance, a minor third), and when the
notes are over, it will tell you what was played along with a colored
background. This builds your association between sound and color, as
well as trains your ear to intervals.
</p><p>
Now, let's take a look at the Preferences screen. Two default soundfonts usually are provided for you under /usr/share/sounds/sf2, but
if you don't like these soundfonts, don't have any or want to change
the instrument (a guitar springs to mind), you can change the soundfont
with the Soundfont option at the top. The next option, Learning Mode,
is equally important. Learning Mode plays the sound with the color
at the same time (instead of a black screen), so you can learn it now
and test yourself later.
</p><p>
From here onward, the options start getting musical. You can choose
whether notes are played together, which intervals to play from a long
list, as well as the all important key in which they'll be played (with
the default being the obvious C). I recommend starting off with Learning
Mode with only several intervals selected, testing yourself on these,
and then gradually adding more to the list.
</p><p>
I'm not sure if Synaesthesia is what Jonas really had in mind, or if
he just happened to strike upon the same theme, but this is the first
time I've come across what Synaesthetes always have seen in their minds
being used practically. Of course, it all could backfire as some other
Synaesthete shouts, &ldquo;No, no, a major third is light green, damn
you!&rdquo;,
but personally, I look forward to the inevitable color arguments with glee.

Sunflower&mdash;Twin-Pane File Management
(<a href="http://rcf-group.com" target="_self">rcf-group.com</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Anyone chasing a lightweight file manager is pretty spoiled for
choice when it comes to Linux. However, lightweight usually brings
along with it some nasty compromises&mdash;perhaps an awkward interface,
hideous grayness, bad design or a total lack of aesthetics. Not so
with Sunflower. To quote the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Sunflower is an open-source, small and highly customizable twin-panel file manager
for Linux. It supports plugins. It is possible to run this application on
other systems (Mac OS, Windows), but you will have to install necessary
libraries (Python, GTK 2.0+ and PyGTK).
</p><p>
Currently, this program is still in the heavy development phase and is
open for testing. I plan on releasing versions often during development.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10805f4.large.jpg"><img src="10805f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Keyboard-driven twin-pane file management in glorious full screen&mdash;it's lovely!
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10805f5.large.jpg"><img src="10805f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
As these blank options show, Sunflower is at a rather early stage
in life.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Installing Sunflower actually went off without a hitch. I just
downloaded it and it worked. The hardest part was finding it
on the Web site, but that shouldn't be hard for smart
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
readers! Head to the Download Section, click on Sunflower, and
at the bottom is a download link where you can grab the latest
tarball. Download and extract the tarball, and open a terminal where
you extracted the contents.
</p><p>
As far as library requirements go, I didn't have to install anything,
but anyone with a minimalist system may have to. As 
stated above, you'll need Python, GTK 2.0+ and PyGTK. Once
you're ready to go, run Sunflower by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./Sunflower.py
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Inside the Sunflower window, things feel like a cross between Norton
Commander (hereby referred to as NC, along with its subsequent clones)
and newer file managers, such as Nautilus, Konqueror and so on. Now I
must say that this definitely is early alpha stuff, and as such, a great
deal of features that most people take for granted are still missing, which
is evident when you click on Tools, only to be greeted with nothing.
</p><p>
This current sparseness extends to the Options list where every tab
also is empty (at least it was at the time of this writing). As a result of this,
I recommend clicking on Settings&rarr;Show command bar, so basic functions,
such as copying, moving, editing and others, at least will be provided for
you at the bottom of the screen.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, don't let what I've just said put you off, because Sunflower
has one supreme strength: it's delightfully keyboard-driven!
It takes me back to the days of lazily browsing around inside the
NC with only the arrow and Enter keys, without all of the
comparatively headache-inducing GUI elements that were about to come,
competing for your attention and getting in the way. As the keyboard is
so essential to Sunflower, Here's a guide for your reference:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Ctrl-T: duplicate tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-W: close tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-Tab: next tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-Shift-Tab: previous tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-Z: open terminal tab.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-R: reload list.
</p></li><li><p>
Backspace: go to parent directory.
</p></li><li><p>
F4: open text editor.
</p></li><li><p>
Alt-Letter: quick search.
</p></li><li><p>
Menu: open file/directory menu.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-Menu: open with menu.
</p></li><li><p>
F7: create directory.
</p></li><li><p>
F8/Delete: delete selection.
</p></li><li><p>
F11: full screen.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-F7: create empty file.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One of the first things you should try is pressing F11, which 
makes Sunflower go full screen, giving you that old NC feel but with
modern GUI elements. You can open files and folders by double-clicking,
but I recommend skipping the mouse entirely and just using the keyboard,
with the well-known combo of the arrow keys for navigating up and down
and Enter for opening or executing something.
</p><p>
Pressing Tab changes between the left and right panes, but unlike NC
and its clones, each pane can have another tab added onto it, bringing
this style of design ethic firmly into the 21st century. Something that
seems to be missing in the Midnight Commander that I took for granted
in NC is the ability to jump between the starting letters of filenames
with two keystrokes (this saved untold amounts of time). Thankfully, this
is featured early on and works well. Just press and hold Alt followed
by whichever letter you're searching for, and you quickly can navigate
inside huge lists of filenames with ease.
</p><p>
Sunflower may be a very early alpha, but it already feels
pretty solid in parts and looks very promising. My apologies go out to
developer MeanEYE for my constant Norton Commander references, but this
old design ethic features here so prominently, and it's refreshing not
only to see and feel it again, but also to have it re-interpreted in a way
that fits 21st-century computing habits so well.
Sunflower seems
bent on keeping only what is necessary. And for those who keep
stripping away, often to the extent where features and functionality
are laughable, Sunflower retains what is genuinely useful over the
last decade of computing, minus the bulk. Although this early Sunflower
currently is far from what most people will be expecting from a file
manager, as time goes by, expected elements (especially
more mouse functionality) will make their way into the interface, and
the beautiful design ethic behind Sunflower will really shine.
