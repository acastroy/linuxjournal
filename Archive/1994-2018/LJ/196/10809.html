A $15 USB thermometer and some spare parts are all I needed to
control my refrigerator with Linux.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c8580.0x28c0408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If loving Linux ever became a crime and I were hauled into court,
I think the prosecution's argument would go something like this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Your honor, I need to submit only two pieces of evidence to make my
case. First, I present Exhibit A: a stack of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> magazines of
which the defendant is a columnist.
</p><p>
And your second piece of evidence?
</p><p>
Your honor, the defendant's refrigerator is powered by Linux.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>(The audience gasps.)</em></span> Order! I've heard enough! Guilty!
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I can't help it. I mean, why <span   class="emphasis"><em>wouldn't</em></span> you power your
fridge with Linux if you had the chance? In my case, we recently purchased
a new fridge for our house, which meant our spare fridge was headed
for the garage where I would use it for beer fermentation. Fridges are
well-insulated, and it seemed ideal for the task at hand, but the problem
I ran into was that the built-in thermostat for the fridge would go
up to only around 45&ndash;50&deg;F at its warmest. To ferment ales, I needed to maintain
temperatures between 60&ndash;72&deg;F.
</p><p>
When most people convert fridges to ferment beer, they
purchase a purpose-built device from their local brew shop. Essentially,
you plug your fridge in to the device, plug the device in to the wall,
and then set the analog thermostat on the device to your desired
temperature. A temperature probe goes into your fridge, and when it gets
too warm, the fridge is powered on. These devices range from around $70 to
more than $100, depending on whether they are analog or digital, and I almost
bought one until I realized I could do the same thing with an old
Linux laptop, a couple pieces of hardware and a few scripts.
</p><p>
If you are into home automation at all, you are familiar with
the X10 suite of home automation gadgets. Essentially, you can connect
lamps and appliances to different X10 gadgets and then power them on
with a remote control. There's even a remote control that connects
to a serial port, so you can control everything from a computer. Linux
has a program called bottlerocket that works great with X10 serial port
controllers, and I had used one to control my DSL modem for many years,
but that's something for another column.

The TEMPer USB Thermometer</h2></div></div><p>
So, I had a laptop and could control the fridge power, but I still needed
a thermometer that worked under Linux and was relatively cheap. I
discovered a great little USB-powered thermometer made by a company
named TEMPer. It's small, cheap (less than $15 shipped), supports temperatures
between &ndash;40&deg;C and +120&deg;C, and with a little effort, it works under Linux. It
turns out many Linux administrators are using these devices to monitor
temperatures in their data centers.

Apparently, the older versions of this thermometer showed up as a
USB-to-serial interface; however, the newer models, including the one I
bought, show up as a USB Human Interface Device when you plug it in:

At first I thought I could get the temperature from this thermometer
through some /proc or /sys interface, but unfortunately, the thermometer
is more proprietary than that. The Linux community is resourceful
though, and a quick search turned up a number of guides on how to pull
the temperature from Linux (see Resources for the most helpful guide I
found). Essentially, you need to install a few
custom Perl modules, including a special one created just for this device
that depends on Perl 5.10, so you need a relatively new distribution
for this to work (I used the latest stable Debian release).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c8580.0x28c0e00"></a>
Install Libraries and Perl Modules</h2></div></div><p>
I've always considered Debian as the distribution with the most packaged
CPAN modules, but even it didn't have many of the modules I needed for the
TEMPer thermometer, so I had to install them from scratch. I'll warn you
in advance, this process is a bit tedious, and it reminded me of what it
was like to install programs on Linux more than a decade ago. It's amazing how
much we take the hard work of package maintainers for granted. At least
the first dependencies I had (headers for libusb and a build environment
to compile the Perl modules) were available with packages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install libusb-dev build-essentials
</pre>
</p><p>
Next I needed to install a few Perl modules with the cpan program. What
you'll find is that many of these modules have their own set of
dependencies, so when you are prompted to install dependencies, just tell
the cpan program &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. Also, the first time you run cpan, you might have
to go through the initial setup program. If so, just accept the defaults,
and you should be fine. Here are the different cpan commands you need
to run in order to install the various modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo cpan Bundle::CPAN
$ sudo cpan ExtUtils::MakeMaker
$ sudo cpan Inline::MakeMaker
$ sudo cpan Device::USB
$ sudo cpan Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer
</pre>
</p><p>
Next I downloaded a Perl script from
<a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~hays/dev/bash/temper/temper_mon.pl" target="_self">www.cs.unc.edu/~hays/dev/bash/temper/temper_mon.pl</a> and made it
executable. When run, the script will print the temperature from the
thermometer. In my case, I modified it so it output in Fahrenheit instead
of Celsius:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl

use 5.010;
use strict;
use warnings;
use Carp;
use Device::USB;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer::Device;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer::NTC;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer::TEMPer; 
use lib;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer;

my $pcsensor  = Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer-&gt;new();
my @devices   = $pcsensor-&gt;list_devices();
  
foreach my $device ( @devices ){
   say $device-&gt;internal()-&gt;fahrenheit();
}
</pre>
</p><p>
I stored the script in /usr/local/sbin/temper_mon.pl and ran it a few
times to make sure it output the correct temperature. Then I connected
the thermometer to a USB extension cord that was long enough to reach
inside the fridge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27c8580.0x28c1278"></a>
My Custom Fridge Script</h2></div></div><p>
The final step in the process was to write a script that would pull the
temperature and control the power to my fridge based on whether it was
within the proper maximum and minimum temperature ranges I had set. I
decided to separate the max and min by two degrees so that the compressor
wouldn't kick on too much. I also wanted to write the results to a log
so I could monitor how well the fridge maintained the temperature. Plus,
I thought it would be cool to <tt  >ssh</tt> in to my laptop from anywhere in the
world and check on the temperature.
</p><p>
When I first set this up, the weather was cool in the evenings, so I
discovered that my fridge would dive down way below the minimum! My
solution was to buy a $15 electric heating pad from the drugstore, connect it
to another X10 outlet, and put it in the bottom of the fridge. I figured
the heat would be gentle enough to maintain the temperature
at night without the risks that a proper space heater would have. I
set up the script so that it would turn on the heater only if the
temperature dipped down one degree below the minimum. I saved my script
in /usr/local/sbin/temper.pl:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/perl

use 5.010;
use strict;
use warnings;
use Carp;
use Device::USB;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer::Device;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer::NTC;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer::TEMPer;
use lib;
use Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer;

my $pcsensor  = Device::USB::PCSensor::HidTEMPer-&gt;new();
my @devices   = $pcsensor-&gt;list_devices();
my $temp_min  = 71;
my $temp_max  = 73;
my $logfile   = '/var/log/temper.log';
my $time      = localtime();
my $temperature;

foreach my $device ( @devices ){
   $temperature = $device-&gt;internal()-&gt;fahrenheit();
}

open LOG, "&gt;&gt; $logfile" or die "Can't open $logfile: $!\n";

# B4 = Fridge power, B5 = Heater power

# turn on heater if I'm 1F below the low temp
if($temperature &lt; ($temp_min - 1)){
   system('br --port /dev/ttyS0 B5 ON');
   print LOG "$time\t$temperature\tHON\n";
}
elsif($temperature &lt; $temp_min){
   system('br --port /dev/ttyS0 B4 OFF');
   system('br --port /dev/ttyS0 B5 OFF');
   print LOG "$time\t$temperature\tOFF\n";
}
elsif($temperature &gt; $temp_max){
   system('br --port /dev/ttyS0 B4 ON');
   print LOG "$time\t$temperature\tCON\n";
}
else{
   print LOG "$time\t$temperature\t\n";
}

close LOG;

</pre>
</p><p>
The way the logic of the script works, it allows the temperature
to drop or rise naturally while the compressor or heater is on,
respectively. It changes the power state of my X10 devices with
the br command only when the temperature is outside the preset ranges. I
set this script to run every minute with cron, and because I log all of the
power states, it's easy to watch the temperature float between extremes. I
did a bit of tuning at the beginning with the various ranges, and with
the current script, the temperature floats between 1&deg;F below the minimum
temperature and 1&deg;F above the maximum temperature, which is good enough
for me. If I wanted more accuracy, I always could set $min and $max to
be closer to each other.
</p><p>
Since the system has been in place, I've been able to maintain
the temperature successfully for the first batch of beer I put in the fridge. If
you look closely at Figure 2, you can see the little thermometer on
the right-hand shelf. Even though my laptop is old, it has plenty of
horsepower to spare, so eventually I will graph all of the temperature
data and serve it out over Apache. If Bill were here, I'm sure he'd tell
me to tweet the temperature.
