A look at Caffeine, Homesick and Mockingbird.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a89300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I admit that when I signed on to do this column, I was really excited to see
Cool Projects on the editorial calendar. It was months away, and
I figured by the time the issue rolled around, I would have something big to
share with you. Things did not quite work out that way.
Because every article I write involves failure in one way or another, I'm
going to
start off telling you a little about the projects that sat on my bench.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a894b8"></a>
Tiny and Shiny</h2></div></div><p>
A very, very tiny handheld computer showed up on my doorstep. It was the
completely copyleft Ben NanoNote.
The manufacturers are not really sure what to do with it, so they have made
it as open as possible to give people a chance to figure it out. I
originally got it because I thought it might make a neat portable Linux
device for my son. I hoped to get basic video replay on it (if nothing else,
to give him something to play with instead of my phone). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10806f1.large.jpg"><img src="10806f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Ben NanoNote
</p></div></div><p>
In some ways, I had flashbacks to playing with the BeagleBoard, because I
quickly realized I was looking at a very neat device, but I didn't have the
foggiest idea of how to get started. There is a wiki and several mailing
lists, and recently, I found a nice blog post showing how someone ported gnugo
over to the device (see Resources).
After spending some time researching, I was forced to admit that it was too
early for me to jump in. The device has potential, but the project as a
whole just is not far enough along for me to participate. Maybe I should
run some kind of contest and give it away to a deserving hacker instead of
letting it sit on my desk mocking me.

That Other Smartphone</h2></div></div><p>
I have been following Android for some time. It seemed like an interesting
platform, but in order to take advantage of it, I would have to switch
carriers, which for a variety of reasons was not on my to-do list. Then,
Google released the Nexus One for AT&amp;T, and I was excited. I have grown
increasingly frustrated with my iPhone, and I thought this would be a great
opportunity to try Android on great hardware. 
</p><p>
So far, it has been great. There have been problems, but I don't end up as
frustrated, because most of the problems I have encountered are bugs,
which means they can be fixed. On the iPhone, several of my problems were
related to running Linux instead of Windows or Mac OS X, which is not a bug
in my book. I have a couple Android books sitting on my bookshelf to
read (which I realize now are probably out of date, as I got them long
before I got the phone). I had hoped to walk through the process of getting
an application up and running. Instead, I have settled into the role of
end user rather than power programmer, which has been great for my phone
experience even if it does not help my writing.

What's Cool?</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've cleared my guilt backlog, the good news is that I have found
some cool projects out there&mdash;they're just being done by other people, and
I get to use them. In all three cases, these are tools I have picked
up recently and use them to get stuff done.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a89a38"></a>
Caffeine</h2></div></div><p>
Caffeine was one of those wonderful discoveries, because it brought to
light a problem I did not even know I had, and it originally
was demonstrated on a Mac. Let's say you're watching a video. After a
while,
you get so engrossed in the clip that you don't move your mouse or touch
your keyboard, because you actually are watching it with your full attention.
Then, your screensaver kicks in (as a bonus, you have a password on it).
Or, say
you're giving a presentation and you stay on a slide a while so you can
answer a bunch of questions, and the screen blacks out to save power. In the
past, there were two ways to handle this. You could just remember to flick
your mouse every so often (which is annoying and error-prone), or you 
turn off the screensaver, which means you have to remember to turn
it back on later. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10806f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Caffeine
</p></div></div><p>
Enter Caffeine. This handy app puts a small coffee cup in your notification
bar. When you want your computer to stay awake, just click the coffee cup.
If you're okay with normal behavior, click on the cup again. This is nice because it
is easy to access, and it gives you a visual cue to remind you what you have
done. There even are options to tell it to kick in for a certain amount of
time. If clicking is too much trouble, you also can tell it to
kick in automatically when certain applications are running (Flash videos,
OpenOffice.org Presentation or Skype, for example).
</p><p>
On Ubuntu, you can add in the PPA (Personal Package Archive). Then,
installation is easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install caffeine
</pre>
</p><p>
It ends up being very handy. As I mentioned, versions of Caffeine exist
for other platforms, so I end up recommending it whenever I see people give
presentations and their screens go dark. Now, it's a standard part of my
installation for my workstations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a89eb0"></a>
Homesick</h2></div></div><p>
Homesick proves that sometimes it pays to wait and spend time on
Google. When I started writing this column, I had an idea to write about my
struggle to keep my home directory synced across a lot of different
workstations. I figured it was a common problem, but I couldn't find an
elegant solution. I originally hoped to drag in cloud storage, so I didn't
have to access my home computer directly to stay in sync. 
</p><p>
I spent a lot of time searching and didn't find what I was looking for, so
I started to sketch up some ideas of how to solve the problem. That's when
I realized something very important about writing a column: there always
is a deadline looming. I ended up shelving the idea of starting a brand-new
project and focused on writing about something I actually could finish in time to
talk about. In that case, it was a BeagleBoard.
</p><p>
As I was working on a project last week, I stumbled into Homesick. It was
designed to solve this exact problem. It introduced the idea of
&ldquo;castles&rdquo;, which are different repositories of dot files stored in
git repositories. You then can choose to pull down a variety of different
castles on each machine and choose which ones you actually want to use.
</p><p>
In order to use it, you need to have Ruby, RubyGems and git installed.
Once those are installed, simply install the homesick gem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install homesick
</pre>
</p><p>
A castle can be pulled in by referencing a local folder, a remote git
repository or by using the short form if the repository is on GitHub. The
example provided here is from Homesick's author's GitHub site:

<pre     class="programlisting">
homesick clone technicalpickles/pickled-vim
</pre>
</p><p>
This pulls down the vim files from technicalpickles. It does not replace
your existing vim dot files (yet).
</p><p>
In my case, I'd like to build my own vim castle (you do not have to keep
the files in a git repository, although it doesn't hurt):

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir -p delmendo-vim/home
cd delmendo-vim
cp -R ~/.vimrc ~/.viminfo ~/.vim home/
homesick clone ~/Desktop/delmendo-vim
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can ask which castles are installed. In my case, it shows
technicalpickles and delmendo-vim. It should list
technicalpickles/pickled-vim (a bug that should be fixed by the time
this goes to print). 
</p><p>
To activate it, execute the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
homesick symlink technicalpickles/pickled-vim
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2991580.0x2a8a488"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
homesick clone delmendo-vim
</pre>
</p><p>
This starts the process of linking in the files. It also warns
you of conflicts and allows you to look at differences before you make the
swap. The system does not handle synchronizing the files across different
machines, but you easily can handle that either by putting them in a
network-accessible git repository or host the files remotely and mount them. There
are a bunch of ways to do both, but GitHub and Ubuntu One come to
mind. 
</p><p>
The first commit on the project was March 3, 2010, so it's still early.
I hope the features continue to evolve, because it saves me from having to
cobble it together.

Mockingbird</h2></div></div><p>
To be honest, I have absolutely no artistic talent. This is generally
not a problem, because I partner with a great designer (who happens to be my
brother, so he doesn't take it personally when I yell at him). I'm in the
process of launching a Web application. As you probably can tell from my
writing, I'm very comfortable describing things with words, but sometimes
words just don't cut it. 
</p><p>
I tried a lot of different software tools, but none of them worked.
Some failed because they required too much artistic talent on my part. I
always end up feeling like they're designed for designers, which I'm not.
In other cases, I hit a wall with adoption, because I work with people who do
not use Linux, which means I have to select from tools that are completely
cross-platform. In the past, I resorted to scribbling things on paper so I
had some kind of diagram to discuss. Paper was a great medium when
everyone on my team sat in one room, but now that I work with a distributed
team, I end up losing the immediacy of the paper drawing. It also became a
pain to manage scanning and distributing paper documents.
</p><p>
That's when Mockingbird got dropped in my lap (meaning my brother sent me a
link). Mockingbird is a Web-based wire framing tool. Wire framing is where
you just sketch the outline of a design so that you get the idea of what is
happening. It does not provide every last detail. Mockingbird allows you
to design a basic interface and then easily share the URL of your design
with others, or you can export it as a PNG or PDF. The tool ends up being
awesome for me, as it provides a bunch of template items that make it easy
to grab the interface pieces I need. If I need to change
something, I simply drag it around and make quick changes on the fly.
Because it is Web-based, my teammates can use it on their OS of choice.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10806f3.large.jpg"><img src="10806f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Mockingbird
</p></div></div><p>
The first time I used it, I was hooked, but I was a little nervous. It seemed
so interactive, I dreaded to find out what custom plugin was required to
make it all work. I quickly learned it was built using Objective J. I was
really worried this was some new form of Java, but it turns out to be
JavaScript. 
</p><p>
Mockingbird is built using a framework called Cappuccino. This LGPL'd
framework is built in JavaScript, but modeled after GNUstep and Apple's
Cocoa framework (hence the name Objective J inspired by the Objective C of
those frameworks). Cappuccino makes a distinction between itself and
libraries like jQuery by saying that those are about making a dynamic Web
site. Cappuccino is useful only if you are building a full-blown
application. The other toolkit it compares itself to is SproutCore.
Cappuccino is different because it is written entirely in JavaScript and
does not require knowledge of HTML or CSS. 
</p><p>
A word of warning: Mockingbird is not open source. It currently is free
during the &ldquo;beta&rdquo;. At the time of this writing, I don't know
when the beta will end or what the pricing will be like. 
I admit that I have spent
more time drawing with Mockingbird than looking at Cappuccino (which is open
source). I was so impressed with the way you can interact with the drawings
(like being able to select interface items, copy, go to a different page in
the app and so on) that I realized how much I need to look at some of
the &ldquo;application&rdquo; frameworks for JavaScript. The last time I looked
at them was several years ago when I played with ExtJS.
It provided a lot of whiz-bang GUI elements, but
it proved to be too difficult to work with. Maybe that has gotten better in the
interim.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I've realized that for me, &ldquo;cool&rdquo; has a lot more
to do with usage than fashion. Sure, I thought it was an impressive proof
of concept that someone got Android onto the iPhone,
but I'm much more impressed when I discover something that changes how I
work every day. These tools certainly have done that for me.
