Radical Breeze's Illumination Software Creator</h2></div></div><p>
Were you a LEGO-lover as a kid? If so, Radical Breeze thinks you'll find
its new Illumination Software Creator 1.0, a visual software application
builder, extremely intuitive. A user&mdash;even a non-programmer&mdash;can
easily experiment with software building blocks, in a completely visual
and understandable way, and create software that can be run on Linux,
Mac OS X and Windows computers. The application converts visual concepts
into source code. No virtual machine is involved. In addition,
software built with Illumination Software Creator can be run as a rich
Internet Web page or an Internet tablet application (for Nokia Internet
Tablets). The languages utilized are Python and GTK for desktop and mobile
applications, and JavaScript for Web applications.

Robert Love's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Development</em></span>, 3rd Ed. (Addison-Wesley)</h2></div></div><p>
Our old friend Robert Love, whose popular Kernel Korner
column long graced these pages, has updated his classic book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel
Development</em></span> to a new 3rd edition. Published by Addison-Wesley,
this work details the design and implementation of the Linux kernel,
presenting the content in a manner that is beneficial for those writing
and developing kernel code, as well as for programmers seeking to better
understand the operating system and become more efficient and productive
in their coding. The book details the kernel's major subsystems and features, including its design, implementation and interfaces. It
covers the Linux kernel with both a practical and theoretical eye, which
is intended to appeal to readers with a variety of interests and needs.
Updated content includes an all-new chapter on kernel data structures,
details on interrupt handlers and bottom halves, extended coverage of
virtual memory and memory allocation and more.

CloudLinux's LVE Wrappers</h2></div></div><p>
Hosting service providers may want to read on about the new LVE Wrappers
from CloudLinux, tools that let the server owner control the exact
CPU usage for individual users and applications. LVE Wrappers are
based on CloudLinux's Lightweight Virtual Environment technology that
allows administrators to control CPU usage on a server at the tenant or
application level. It does so by isolating specific hardware resources
in a lightweight container and prevents one tenant on a shared server
from affecting others. LVE Wrappers, which start individual applications
and d&aelig;mons inside LVE environments, allow for control of resources for
each application, which allows for greater flexibility and stability
on the overall server infrastructure. The software is available to all
CloudLinux subscribers.

Tony Mullen and Claudio Andaur's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blender Studio Projects: Digital
Movie-Making</em></span> (Sybex)</h2></div></div><p>
Authors Tony Mullen and Claudio Andaur have set out to prove that the
amazing open-source 3-D animation software Blender isn't just for hobbying
anymore. Their new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blender Studio Projects: Digital
Movie-Making</em></span>,
now out from Sybex, shows readers how to do on Blender what one
typically has done with high-end (and high-priced) apps Maya and 3ds Max.
Sybex bills the book as &ldquo;a real-world, roll-up-your-sleeves guide that
plunges straight into step-by-step instructions designed to help you
build skills and create solid assets for film, video and games.&rdquo; The
companion DVD includes starter, intermediate and final files, as well
as movie files to help you every step of the way.

CAST Software's Analysis and Measurement Software for SAP, Siebel and
PeopleSoft</h2></div></div><p>
Managing ERP apps can require the patience of Job, which is why CAST
Software released its new Analysis and Measurement Software for SAP,
Siebel and PeopleSoft. The product's mission is to bring consistent
and objective measurement of these platforms and eliminate costly
customization errors in critical business applications. CAST's own
studies of ERP installations showed a large percentage of issues that
normally go undetected in functional testing and result in serious
performance, stability and maintainability problems. For instance, 80%
of database interactions in ERP installs are handled improperly,
leading to significant business disruption. Environments like SAP,
Siebel and PeopleSoft, says CAST, require a deceptively high level
of customization. Because manual measurement of quality is expensive
and time consuming, automation is useful for exposing flaws that cause
applications to perform erratically.

Bricsys' Bricscad</h2></div></div><p>
The &ldquo;team&rdquo; of Linux-based CAD programs just added a new star player to
its roster, namely Bricscad V10 from Bricsys NV, a high-end DWG-based CAD
platform that previously was only for Windows. Bricsys calls Bricscad
V10 &ldquo;the most application-friendly CAD platform in the
industry&rdquo;,
thanks in part to DCL and LISP APIs that allow existing applications
and customizations written for Windows-based Bricscad and/or AutoCAD to
run without modification. Besides essential CAD functions for users in
GIS, AEC, mechanical CAD and civil engineering, additional core product
benefits include a recognizable interface, comprehensive support and
reasonable price points. Initially, Bricscad will support Red Hat and
Ubuntu Linux.

RiverMuse Pro</h2></div></div><p>
The developers at RiverMuse have given their IT operations management
platform RiverMuse Pro its vitamins for a stronger, more robust offering.
Now in version 2.0, RiverMuse Pro combines the power of a robust Manager
of Managers (MoM) functionality&mdash;centralizing event collection from
other management systems as well as from the infrastructure&mdash;with
real-time event correlation and analysis (ECA) capabilities to detect and
alert on business-impacting incidents. RiverMuse says that the platform's
architecture &ldquo;offers a number of disruptive innovations that are
critical to managing dynamic and virtualized environments that are common
in IT environments today.&rdquo; The new version 2 focuses on mid-market
service providers and enterprises, enabling them to assure delivery
of dynamic IT services through advanced event capture, correlation
and alerting. A free and open-source RiverMuse Core also is available.

CodeWeavers' CrossOver Games</h2></div></div><p>
Our zany friends over at CrossOver were on the verge of mutiny since
the grand poobah boss, Jeremy White, scheduled the release of CrossOver
Games 9.0 just when <span   class="emphasis"><em>Iron Man 2</em></span> was hitting the
theaters. We're told that
in order to ensure programmers continued working weekends without break,
White created a makeshift &ldquo;electric whip&rdquo; and paced around the office
screaming &ldquo;full Steam ahead, minions!&rdquo; in a mediocre Russian accent.
The intimidation apparently worked, because the team pushed out both
Linux and Mac versions of CrossOver Games, which allows one to play
Windows-based games on these platforms. Version 9.0 supports the new
Steam UI, <span   class="emphasis"><em>StarCraft 2</em></span> (beta) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>StarTrek
Online</em></span>, as well as enables
users to install games from a single screen and a single click on
CodeWeavers' compatibility center. Furthermore, users who figure out
how to use CrossOver to install a Windows-compatible game can upload
the installation recipe to the company's database.
