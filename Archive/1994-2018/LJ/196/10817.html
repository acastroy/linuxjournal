SSDs are the future, but are they ready for prime time today?

<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> You know, I just got a new 2.5"
drive for my laptop.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah? What'd you get?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Picked up a 7200RPM 500GB disk for
$100&mdash;half a terabyte, man.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> That's a lot of storage, but really?
7200RPM? That hasn't been a fast rotation speed for about a decade. Why not
get a solid-state drive?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> SSDs are too expensive for my taste,
and they don't hold nearly enough data. I like carrying my movies, music
and docs around with me&mdash;despite the fact that I love cloud storage.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I suppose they are a little pricey,
but you get a huge performance boost with that price. Plus, it's not too
expensive to get a 100Gb+ drive, which should be enough for most of the
things you'd need on a laptop. Oh, and nice try throwing the cloud in there
to distract me. The fact is, many people are using their laptops as their
primary machines these days, and for heavy use, 7200RPM laptop drives just
don't cut it. That's especially true if you want to play around with any
kind of virtualization. Have you ever tried running two VMs at the same
time on a 7200RPM laptop drive? I have, and it's painful.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> For heavy use, 7200RPM drives don't cut it? What crack are you on,
man? My machines are plenty fast for what I need. I just priced a 128GB
SSD,
and it's $475! That's nearly 4x the cost for 1/4 the storage. A 256GB SSD
is $679. Crazy prices, man. I can buy a whole <span   class="emphasis"><em>laptop</em></span> for $679.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> The prices are a bit high right now,
but they keep coming down. Sure,
you can buy a whole laptop for $679, or for $1k, you could buy a laptop with
twice the performance. With the multicore and other high specs in machines
these days, the disk is definitely the bottleneck. If you solve that
problem, you can take advantage of the rest of the machine.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Not to mention there's the whole
&ldquo;not fully baked yet&rdquo; issue with the
technology. Do you remember Intel's boo-boo when it had some firmware
glitch that killed performance and ate your data? Rotating media isn't
perfect, but its issues are known. I love the smell of baked data in the
morning&mdash;just like when I tried XFS at your insistence.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> That's true, rotational media has
<span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> had a
firmware problem nor issues that resulted in data loss. They certainly
don't have <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> problems in portable devices like laptops
if they get any kind of shock. The fact is, it's common now for laptops to
have at least two cores, if not more. Parallel computing is not just the
future, it's how we use our computers today, and you need storage that
doesn't choke with multiple processes accessing random sections of disk.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> This from a guy who was running a single-core laptop until just a few
months ago&mdash;with a 1.8" disk, if I recall.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah, in fact, it was a 1.8" disk, a 5400RPM one (the fastest they
made at the time), until I upgraded it to SSD. The old rotation media in the
laptop just didn't cut it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I didn't say they haven't had
issues. But, SSDs were touted as
invulnerable and the greatest thing since sliced bread until that point.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm sure you still listen to music on vinyl, so no wonder
you prefer your storage to use the same technology. At least if you bump
your record player, you risk only a scratch and not a head crash.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Hey, I don't listen to vinyl. Are you not paying attention to our
own column? I listen to music on my iPhone, man. And, not all SSDs are super
performance-oriented. I have a Netbook with an SSD in it, and the thing is
the biggest POS I have ever used.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I agree not all SSDs are equal. You have
to do a bit of research, just
like with video cards or any hardware purchase where performance matters.
Oh, and thanks for the lessons on data integrity. I must be remembering some
other friend of mine who trashed his rotational laptop drive by putting his
magnetic palm pilot case too close to it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Yes, I killed my disk. Like you've never smoked a piece of gear. It's
funny how recently you got on the performance bandwagon too. I remember
you telling me that &ldquo;a single 1.2GHz core was fast enough&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;I'm willing
to pay the penalty for a slow 1.8" disk for the portability&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah, I <span   class="emphasis"><em>was</em></span> willing to pay the penalty for portability. Now my main
portable computer is an N900, so I can stand to have a slightly larger laptop
that can handle a larger drive. Recently, I've tried using it for virtual
machines, and the 7200RPM drive it has is a pain. It just chokes when you
have too much going on. I'm wishing I had invested in an SSD when I first
spec'd it out, but I figured I'd give the 7200RPM drive a chance
first.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Regarding g-forces and rotating
media, the new accelerometer-based
tech has helped disks survive crazy things, and the smaller, lighter head
shave helped too. Anytime you have IO contention, you'll have performance
issues. Faster disks move that out. But really, it's not like two VMs are
unusable&mdash;I have two going on my laptop routinely. Matter of fact, one of
them is how I access e-mail (don't ask, I have some totally bizarre
corporate antics to put up with).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm glad they've made the tech equivalent of a seat belt and airbag
to save your rotating media, but I'd rather it not be a problem in the
first place. I mean, even the iPod figured out SSDs were the way to go years
ago. I'd figure if it's good enough for Apple, it'd be good enough for you.
The bottom line for me is that my laptop is more than just a portable
computer, it's my main computer for anything resource-hungry these days (I
use a pocket computer for everything else). So performance matters,
especially when I have multiple processes accessing different parts of the
disk at once. SSDs are the future, and although they are a bit pricey now, the
price keeps coming down and will continue to come down.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Hey, it's all about price/performance ratio. SSDs appear to have
about an 8x premium, and that's not something I'm willing to pay when a
7200RPM disk gets the job done for me and allows me to carry all the data I
could possibly want and more. SSDs are the future&mdash;yes, I grant you that.
But, we live in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>present</em></span>, and I'm totally fine with
letting early adopters like you find the data-eating bugs and drive the
cost down to the point where it does make sense for me to buy. Today, my
money's still on good-old rotating media.
