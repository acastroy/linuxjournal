By handling signals in your bash scripts, you can provide features
that are otherwise difficult, such as telling your script to reread
its configuration file after it's already been started.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111c580.0x12143b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This month, I thought it would be interesting to take a bit of a detour from
my usual multi-month programming projects and instead focus on a specific
topic that is of great importance to people writing longer scripts: signal
management.
</p><p>
Signals are numeric messages sent to running applications from the
operating system, other applications or the user, and they generally invoke
a specific response like &ldquo;shut down gracefully&rdquo;, &ldquo;stop
running so I can put you in the background&rdquo; or &ldquo;die!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Most likely, you've used the kill command to send signals to
different programs, but if you've ever pressed Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z to stop
a running app, you've also sent signals to a running application.
</p><p>
A signal is managed in a cascading manner. It's sent to the application
or script, then if the application doesn't have a specific handler
(signal management or response function), it's pushed back to the shell
or operating system. Some signals can't be managed within individual
apps, like SIGKILL, which is caught by the operating system and immediately
kills the running application (including the shell: SIGKILL your login
shell and you just logged out).
</p><p>
To start this journey, let's find out what signals your version of
Linux can handle. Do this by typing <tt  >kill -l</tt>
(that's a lowercase L, not the digit 1):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ kill -l
1)  SIGHUP    2) SIGINT      3) SIGQUIT   4) SIGILL
5)  SIGTRAP   6) SIGABRT     7) SIGEMT    8) SIGFPE
9)  SIGKILL  10) SIGBUS     11) SIGSEGV  12) SIGSYS
13) SIGPIPE  14) SIGALRM    15) SIGTERM  16) SIGURG
17) SIGSTOP  18) SIGTSTP    19) SIGCONT  20) SIGCHLD
21) SIGTTIN  22) SIGTTOU    23) SIGIO    24) SIGXCPU
25) SIGXFSZ  26) SIGVTALRM  27) SIGPROF  28) SIGWINCH
29) SIGINFO  30) SIGUSR1    31) SIGUSR2
</pre>
</p><p>
Most of these are uninteresting. The cool ones are SIGHUP, which is sent on
a &ldquo;hangup&rdquo; or the user logging out; SIGINT, which is a simple
interrupt (Ctrl-C, usually); SIGKILL, the &ldquo;terminate with extreme
prejudice&rdquo; of signals; SIGTSTP, which is Ctrl-Z; SIGCONT, which is what
the application gets from the shell commands fg and bg subsequent
to a SIGTSTP; SIGWINCH, which is for window system events like a window
resize; and SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, which are intended for interprocess
communication.
</p><p>
Let's write some code to see what happens, shall we? Signals are
caught with the &ldquo;trap&rdquo; built in, and the general format of these
signal mapping commands is exemplified with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap 'echo "Ctrl-C Ignored" ' INT
</pre>
</p><p>
How do we play with that as a shell script? Here's an easy way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

trap 'echo " - Ctrl-C ignored" ' INT
while /usr/bin/true ; do
  sleep 30
done

exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Did you catch the infinite loop there? It's barely using any
resources because most of its time is spent in &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;, but if you
don't do something to end it, this script will run forever or until the
Mayans are proven right two years from now&mdash;one of the two.
</p><p>
Let's look at a more flexible way to manage signals by creating shell
script functions:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sigquit()
{
   echo "signal QUIT received"
}

sigint()
{
   echo "signal INT received, script ending"
   exit 0
}

trap 'sigquit' QUIT
trap 'sigint'  INT
trap ':'       HUP      # ignore the specified signals

echo "test script started. My PID is $$"
while /usr/bin/true ; do
  sleep 30
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Run this then from another terminal window and shoot some signals at it.
</p><p>
Now, let's get that script started and watch what happens when we send a
few different signals:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./test.sh
test script started. My PID is 25309
signal QUIT received
signal INT received, script ending
$
</pre>
</p><p>
Perfect! To send the signals, execute the following commands
from a different terminal window:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ kill -HUP  25309
$ kill -QUIT 25309
$ kill -INT  25309
</pre>
</p><p>
Armed with this useful script, let's have a look at how to handle
a more complex signal like Ctrl-Z within a shell script.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111c580.0x1214fb8"></a>
Stop! Don't Stop!</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to create a scenario here rather than just going
through the intellectual exercise. In a complex script, you realize that
you have certain passages where you need to ignore the TSTP signal (SIGTSTP
or Ctrl-Z or signal number 18) and other spots where it's fine to stop and restart.
Can it be done?
</p><p>
To start working out a solution, I'll create a function that not only
handles the specified signal, but also disables itself after a single
invocation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sigtstp()
{
  echo "SIGTSTP received" &gt; /dev/tty
  trap - TSTP
  echo "SIGTSTP standard handling restored"
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Invoke <tt  >trap - signal</tt> somewhere else in the script,
and you've reset that signal handler, so if I have the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap 'sigtstp' TSTP
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111c580.0x1215278"></a></h2></div></div><p>
right before the section where I don't want the Ctrl-Z to work,
it'll ignore that first Ctrl-Z, then reset the signal handler and work
as expected the second time you press that key.
</p><p>
More useful is to ignore all Ctrl-Z stop signals until you're ready to
deal with them, and that's quite easily done with the minimalist:

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap : TSTP  # ignore Ctrl-Z requests
</pre>
</p><p>
And, then when you're ready to receive them again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
trap - TSTP  # allow Ctrl-Z requests
</pre>
</p><p>
Experimentation will show that there are some weird terminal buffering
issues associated with SIGTSTP, however, so don't be surprised if
you have a signal handler that has output. In this particular instance, it
won't show up until the script quits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111c580.0x1215590"></a>
Reading a Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>
Let's look at a more practical example. Say you have an admin script that
is always supposed to be running as a d&aelig;mon, but occasionally you want to
tweak its configuration file and have it reread its setup (a lot faster
than killing and restarting it).
</p><p>
Further, let's use SIGUSR1 for this task, as that is its intended use,
so we're using the kernel's signal handling subsystem in the manner
it was intended.
</p><p>
Reading a configuration file might be something as simple as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
. $config
</pre>
</p><p>
(Recall that using . means that any variables set in the
secondary file affect the current shell, not a subshell.
The source command does the same thing as the . command.)
</p><p>
Here's our script to experiment with this feature:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

config="our.config.file"
sigusr1()
{
  echo "(SIGUSR1: re-reading config file)"
  . $config
}

trap sigusr1 USR1       # catch -USR1 signal

echo "Daemon started. Assigned PID is $$"

. $config               # read it first time

while /usr/bin/true; do
  echo "Target number = $number"
  sleep 5
done

trap - USR1             # reset to be elegant

exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
We'll start with the configuration file containing
<tt  >number=5</tt>,
then after 10&ndash;15 seconds, change it to <tt  >number=1</tt>. Until we send
the actual USR1 signal, however, the script just plugs along without a clue
that it has changed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./test2.sh
Daemon started. Assigned PID is 25843
Target number = 5
Target number = 5
Target number = 5
</pre>
</p><p>
Meanwhile, in another window, I've already edited the file, so I type in
this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ kill -USR1 25843
</pre>
</p><p>
And, here's what happens in the main script window:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(SIGUSR1: re-reading config file)
Target number = 1
Target number = 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Cool, eh?
</p><p>
I hope this exploration of signal handling in shell scripts is
useful. I actually learned quite a bit about advanced handling as I
researched the code here. I'm still a bit stymied about how to reset the output
stream after catching a SIGTSTP, but I bet that some sharp
