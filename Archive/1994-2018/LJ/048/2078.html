A commercial editor would have to be quite powerful and easy to use
to attract prospective customers in the Linux community, where the
tradition of using freely-available software is deeply rooted.
Visual SlickEdit, developed and marketed by MicroEdge, fits these
two criteria. This editor is cross-platform, with versions
available for all three Windows variants, OS/2 and a variety of
Unix platforms. Recently MicroEdge released version 3.0 of
SlickEdit, which brings several new enhancements to an already
powerful editor. The closest free equivalents to SlickEdit are GNU
Emacs and XEmacs, so in this review I will use these two editors as
benchmarks for comparison.
</p><p>In contrast to the two Emacs variants, SlickEdit is strictly
an X application, although it originated as a character-mode
editor. The character-mode console version is still available but
is marketed separately.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1976580.0x1a6ea80"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Visual SlickEdit comes on five floppy disks. The installation
is initiated by directly unpacking (using tar) the first disk's
contents into a temporary directory, setting execute permission on
an installation binary, then running the binary. From this point
questions concerning preferred paths are asked, and eventually the
option of whether or not to install the uncompiled macro files is
offered. These *.e files aren't necessary for normal editor
operation but can be installed if a user wishes to modify them. Not
installing them will save some disk space.</p><p>I consider the choice of installation directories to be a
very desirable feature, as each user will most likely have a
different partition or directory with enough space. A full
installation occupies about 18MB. Network installations are
possible with each user sharing a common executable but running the
program with personal initialization files and home
directories.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1976580.0x1a6ebe0"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>The 250-page printed manual supplied with the software is
well written and complete, though the well-indexed on-line help
system (see Figure 1) offers more than enough guidance while
learning to effectively use the editor. About a third of the
printed manual is a reference guide to the Slick-C language, which
is invaluable for advanced users needing to create new macros and
routines.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2078f1.large.jpg"><img src="2078f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Help Window</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1976580.0x1a6eef8"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>The MicroEdge developers have written a new macro programming
language for this editor called Slick-C, which is derived from C++.
The syntax is very close to that of C++, but the language has
built-in features which are useful for building graphical user
interfaces. Slick-C is analogous to Emacs LISP in that many of the
routines and functions of the editor are implemented as compiled
macros which are called as needed by the main executable.</p><p>The developers of Slick-C have attempted to address several
shortcomings of C++, such as the lack of built-in types. Boolean,
string and container types can be useful when developing editing
functions, and Slick-C is designed to work with such types. As with
any application-specific programming or macro language, the
disadvantage is the necessity of learning yet another language if
extensive customization is desired. Slick-C is close enough to C++
that the learning curve for C or C++ programmers shouldn not be too
steep, but it's still there.</p><p>Just as the Emacs LISP *.el files are ASCII text compiled for
efficiency into *.elc files, the Slick-C *.e files can be compiled
into binary *.ex files. The advantage of a separate macro language
is that new routines and functions can be written without the need
of a new executable, and macro routines tend to be easier to write
and debug than an entire editor with the new functions
included.</p><p>Clipboard Inheritance is an interesting feature of the
language, allowing new code to be added to existing controls
without affecting the original. That is, parts of existing dialog
boxes can be copied to the clipboard and pasted elsewhere; if new
code is added to the original dialog box, it is inherited by its
offspring.</p><p>A feature which programmers will find useful is called
SmartPaste. This is an intelligent, syntax-aware version of the
standard editing function. If a block of code is cut or copied and
then pasted into another source file, the indentation of the pasted
block will automatically match that of the surrounding code. I'm
unaware of an equivalent Emacs function, but evidently there hasn't
been a strong demand or (I surmise) someone would probably have
written one by now.</p><p>SlickEdit uses its own versions of several Unix/Linux
utilities such as <span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>, among others. This feature
would probably be more desirable for users with the Windows or OS/2
versions of the editor. The only advantage under Linux is that the
interface is via dialog boxes, and the utilities are optimized for
use with the editor. In version 3.0 the traditional Unix regular
expression syntax is supported.</p><p>Support for a variety of version-control systems is included,
and unlike the Emacs editors, various commercial version-control
programs are supported, which is an advantage for programmers
working in a commercial environment.</p><p>The command-line window can be used to enter shell commands
as well as native editor commands. The command can be executed in a
separate terminal window, such as an xterm, if the output needs to
be monitored or if interaction is required. Some basic shell
conveniences, such as aliasing and command history, are built into
this interface.</p><p>Like the various Emacs editors (and few others) SlickEdit has
an incremental search command, finding the next match of a search
word, phrase or regular expression as it is typed. In most cases,
the search finds the desired pattern before it has been completely
typed in, speeding up the process.</p><p>Most modern Integrated Development Environments, such as
Borland's, allow all of the files involved in a programming project
to be accessed as a unit. SlickEdit includes this feature. A
SlickEdit project includes the working directory, compile/make
command lines and a list of pertinent files. Tagging (like Emacs'
Etags program) is supported, enabling quick navigation through
function definitions and other programming constructs.</p><p>The syntax-highlighting support is well done and easy to
configure, once again with dialog boxes. Several color schemes are
included with the default installation, and they provide good
starting points for further modification.</p><p>SlickEdit has a number of nicely implemented formatting
features, such as the ability to indent or un-indent selected lines
with the <b  >tab</b> key.</p><p>Although this editor has its own file-manager window, the
list of most recently accessed files found in the File drop-down
menu is very convenient. A few other editors, such as Nedit and
FTE, save a similar history of files opened in previous sessions,
and it's a time-saving feature if there are certain files which are
repeatedly loaded.</p><p>Some of the other useful features are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>three-way file merging</p></li><li><p>hex editing</p></li><li><p>built in spell-checker and dictionary (not quite as

the scope and variety of ways the editor can be molded to a user's
preferences. The main difference between the Emacs and the
SlickEdit approaches is in the user interfaces. SlickEdit makes
extensive use of dialog boxes, windows which allow a user to type
in preferences or define macros and keybindings. The Emacs approach
tends towards editing the various init files, such as ~/.emacs or
~/.xemacs-options, adding entries which load various packages,
functions and keybindings. If it weren't for the large corpus of
Emacs packages available, most provided with explicit instructions
for installation and usage, the SlickEdit method would have a
definite edge.</p><p>Open a source code file in SlickEdit and (with the default
set-up) a variety of windows will appear along with the expected
basic view of the file. A narrow vertical project window contains
links to every procedure or class (in a C++ or Java file) and
clicking on one will scroll the editing window to the corresponding
location in the file. This window can also display a list of source
files in a project; a file can be loaded into the editing window,
then the project window can be toggled so that it will display all
procedures or classes in the file. In effect this updated and
graphical approach to the &ldquo;tags&rdquo; file functionality is familiar
to Emacs and vi users. Another available window will display the
output of child processes such as compilation.</p><p>In keeping with SlickEdit's tendency towards maximum
configurability, all of these child windows can be easily
customized or disabled via a menu-accessed dialog box. Entirely new
toolbars and subwindows can be created and saved within this dialog
box, and the visibility of any of the child windows or toolbars can
be toggled to suit the user's current needs. These toolbars can be
either free-floating or &ldquo;docked&rdquo; to a specified edge of the main
window (see Figure 2).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2078f2.large.jpg"><img src="2078f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. SlickEdit Main Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>The drawback I've found with customization of SlickEdit is
that there aren't as many configuration packages available, so even
though you have nice graphical windows in which to enter your
information, in most cases you have to start from scratch. As an
example, if you want to have a useful set of hot-keys for the
various HTML tags, in Emacs you have a choice of several
key-binding packages, such as HTML-Helper-Mode or HM-HTML-Menus.
SlickEdit doesn't come with such bindings, so you have to set them
up yourself. Version 3.0 does have a useful new feature for
HTML-editing: the spell-checker is aware of HTML tags and will
ignore them.</p><p>The editor can easily be set up to use any of several
keyboard emulation packages, such as Emacs, VI or Brief. The
default is SlickEdit's own CUA/Windows keymapping. Of course, any
and all keys can be remapped to the user's preference. Keyboard
macros are easily and conveniently set up via a dialog box and can
be saved for subsequent reuse. A macro is automatically translated
into the Slick-C language and compiled when it is saved, speeding
its subsequent execution.</p><p>

Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>One of the most impressive features of this editor is the
dialog box editing and creation facility (see Figures 3 and 4). The
interface is reminiscent of Visual Basic and allows any of the
existing dialog boxes to be changed to suit your preferences. On
first exposure, it seemed that this was customization carried to an
extreme. Is it really necessary to be able to shift a button or
menu in a dialog box to another location in the box or change its
font and color? After further experimentation the real value of
this feature becomes apparent. The dialog boxes are written in the
Slick-C language, and the dialog editor is in effect a visual
development environment for the language, specialized for
dialog-box creation. Any of the supplied dialogs can easily be
edited into an interface for any editing function a user might
desire.</p><p>This feature could be a time-saver in a development firm
employing many programmers; dialog-boxes could be created
specifically for the local language and type of project, then
propagated to the individual developers' machines.</p><p>Any of these same Slick-C commands could be typed in the
command-line entry field at the bottom of the editor window, which
illustrates the hybrid nature of this editor. The concept of
performing tasks via the mouse and dialogs is reminiscent of the
Windows and Macintosh interfaces, both of which evolved as
alternatives to the spare command-line environment of Unix or DOS.
SlickEdit has a foot in each of these worlds, allowing a user
either to intermingle the two approaches or ignore one while using
the other.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1976580.0x1a676d0"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>I found SlickEdit to be a very responsive editor on my
Pentium 120 machine with 32MB of memory. Its memory footprint and
loading time are comparable to those of GNU Emacs, and about half
of what XEmacs requires. Search and replace operations are quick,
and file operations (loading, switching from one buffer to another,
etc.) seem to be as fast as can be expected.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1976580.0x1a677d8"></a>Availability and Support</h2></div></div><p>MicroEdge maintains a web site for SlickEdit users and
prospective customers at http://www.slickedit.com/. Patches for
registered users are available there, as well as macros and tips
from other users and the MicroEdge developers.</p><p>At around $200 US for the Linux version, the price will
probably be too steep for many Linux users, especially with so many
high-quality free editors available. The program is intended for
professional developers, in particular those working in a
cross-platform shop. A programmer routinely collaborating on large
projects with colleagues using Windows, OS/2 or another Unix
variant would find this editor very useful, as project files and
macros are compatible across platforms.</p></div></div>
