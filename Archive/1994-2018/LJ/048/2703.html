System&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>In <i  >Linux Journal</i>, November 1997, there
is an article by Marc Allen about Linux running a gasoline station.
Mr. Allen, an employee of the vendor of the system, Schlumberger,
states: &ldquo;We are, however, the only Unix-based one.&rdquo;</p><p>Not a bad story, but not completely true. At the gasoline
station where my brother works, the whole system (pump control,
sales, e-cash) has been working under SCO Unix for more than 1
year&mdash;24 hours a day, 7 days a week, running on a 80486 PC.</p><p>The company that makes the software is Sofitam of Belgium
(Satam is the gasoline station equipment).</p><p>&mdash;Groeten Ben Erkens, The
Netherlands berkens@airchips.xs4all.nl</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183e348"></a>Linux as Proxy Server</h2></div></div><p>I would like to point out that in the article called &ldquo;Linux
as a Proxy Server&rdquo; by Peter Elton in the December issue of
<i  >LJ</i> there was absolutely no mention of Linux's
built-in firewalling and proxying support. As I think most seasoned
&ldquo;roll your own&rdquo; kernel compilers will know, Linux can do almost
all of what Peter describes without resorting to any extra
user-level daemons or utilities. I am speaking specifically of the
kernel's IP Masquerading, Transparent Proxying, Accounting and
Firewalling features. From the included Listing 1, it seems that
Peter was using a very antiquated kernel indeed and perhaps these
features did not exist. When writing about bleeding-edge operating
systems one should do the proper homework to be aware of current OS
features.</p><p>&mdash;Oliver Jones orj@ihug.co.nz</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183e500"></a>Something Funny</h2></div></div><p>I have been following <i  >LJ</i> for over a year
now and can't believe how good it's getting. I like the design
changes, the way you shortened the &ldquo;What is Linux&rdquo; part, and
every issue is a better mix of topics than the last one.</p><p>If you want to hear something funny, my brother works at a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>major</em></span> American software company, and he tells
me that developers there are bringing up the topic of porting their
products to the Linux platform more and more frequently. Apparently
there is a lot of Linux quietly installed around the world (enough
to be seen as a significant market by a large American software
player).</p><p>&mdash;Harold Sinclair morelife@stealth.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183e768"></a>Microway Screamer 533 Review</h2></div></div><p>I'm writing in response to the review of the &ldquo;Microway
Screamer 533&rdquo; by Bradley Willson which appeared in the January
issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. This review is
especially timely for me as the research group I work with is
purchasing a new computer for development work, and the price and
performance of the Alpha-PC running Linux are extremely attractive.
As I started to read the article, however, my excitement quickly
waned. Nowhere in the review of the Screamer 533 are there
meaningful benchmarks. Moreover, the benchmark that the author put
together is worthless for precisely the reasons mentioned in the
article: so why include it?</p><p>The author would have done better for <i  >Linux Journal</i> and Microway if he had included results from the
SPEC benchmarks (SPEC benchmarks run on the Screamer 533,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> benchmarks from Digital with the
533/21164A chip running Digital Unix in some form of an Alpha
Station), the BYTE and Bonnie benchmarks and, perhaps, some of
Microway's own programs. All benchmarks have shortcomings but they
are much more useful to convince coworkers and bosses with than
stories of fast cars.</p><p>Please <i  >Linux Journal</i>, give us meaningful
hardware reviews.</p><p>&mdash;Rich McClellan rich@chemistry.ucsc.edu</p><p>I wrote to Ann Fried and asked her if she would make 533
benchmark numbers available on their web site. I have not received
a reply yet.</p><p>For you, the article did not satisfy your questions and for
that I apologize. I wrote the article for a less technical audience
because of market demographics. There are simply more Intel/Linux
users than Alpha/Linux people. The focus of the piece was to direct
their attention to a machine they might otherwise overlook because
of price, technical astigmatism or both. The academic and technical
audiences generally have resources that allow them to own an Alpha
and understand it, as you have demonstrated.</p><p>I realize that this does not help you sell the machine to
management, and to that end I will continue to work with Microway
to get some meaningful numbers to you.</p><p>&mdash;Bradley J. Willson cpu@ifixcomputers.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183ec38"></a>Evil Cookies</h2></div></div><p>In January's &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo;, Mr. Lerner writes that cookie
information cannot be shared between different web sites. True, but
cookies still present a danger to people's privacy. The large
banner ad sites all use cookies, and their ads appear as in-line
images on many web sites. So it doesn't matter if you visit Lycos,
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>New York Times</em></span> or some other site&mdash;as long
as the banner ad is there, the banner ad site will be able to use
its cookie to track where you've been and tailor the ads it shows
you appropriately.</p><p>&mdash;Joey Hess joey@kitenet.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183edf0"></a>Linux Ports</h2></div></div><p>I am writing in response to Dave Blondell's letter in
December, where he says &ldquo;The sad truth of the matter is that
Bentley, and for that matter most other software companies, don't
get enough requests for Linux ports to justify the production
costs.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps it's true for ports from non-Unix environments, but
it surely is not true otherwise. In the same issue, a look at
&ldquo;Linux Makes the Big Leagues&rdquo; by Sam Williams and the &ldquo;A Place
for Linux&rdquo; presentation by Chip Richards (mentioned by Sam) shows
exactly how I persuaded our company to start using Linux. For only
$250 we could have Linux with Metro Link Motif&mdash;what's more, we
could use a cheap PC clone that put our HP715 to shame in the
performance stakes.</p><p>Since we associate closely with some of our clients, they
often visit and get to see some of the new enhancements that are
under development. Often they noticed how fast Linux was compared
to other platforms, and switched to Linux.</p><p>And the best part is that I never need to change a line of
code when compiling across platforms&mdash;I use simple shell scripts
that are used as CC and LN. The combination of Linux[Intel] with
its BIG ENDIAN architecture and HP-PA RISC with its nice LITTLE
ENDIAN (same as networking) provides a nice combination of test
beds to ensure both byte swapping and 64/32 bit compatibility are
tested.</p><p>At the end of the day it is no extra effort to provide a
Linux solution. Probably the biggest deterrent is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>loud</em></span> anti-commercial chorus. Those folks who
don't mind paying for software should be more vocal.</p><p>While not everyone may appreciate or use any of the free
software that I have contributed to the Linux community, some of
the credit must go to my employer (who does not provide free
software as a rule), for the skills and resources I used to create
my free software were gained from them; in return, they use some of
my free software.</p><p>&mdash;Ross Linder ross@mecalc.co.za</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183f160"></a>Author Photos</h2></div></div><p>Did you guys happen to notice how much the author Richard
Sevenich bears a resemblance to the author Dean Provins? By golly,
they could be brothers.</p><p>&mdash;M. David Gelbmand gelbman@npiny.com</p><p>Yes, we did notice. Unfortunately, at the same time you
did&mdash;when the magazine arrived from the printer, not before we sent
it to be printed. We apologize to both Mr. Sevenich and Mr. Provins
for the mixup &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183f318"></a>Articles on Beowulf Systems</h2></div></div><p>Thanks for the articles on the Beowulf systems and PVM. I
have known Patrick Goda of the Loki system for three years now,
since he came to our local Linux User's Group this past spring to
talk about Loki.</p><p>I was a little disappointed that there was no mention of what
I consider to be the ultimate in &ldquo;Freely Distributed Systems&rdquo;:
the &ldquo;Stone SouperComputer&rdquo;. The Stone SouperComputer is a project
at the Oak Ridge National Labs, the same laboratory that gave us
the PVM software.</p><p>It seems that a project at Oak Ridge needed some computer
power, but had no budget for it. They decided to implement a
Beowulf system using <span   class="emphasis"><em>donated</em></span> computers. By
using older 486 and low-end 586 systems donated to them, they were
able to create a <span   class="emphasis"><em>no-cost</em></span> supercomputer. It now
has 48 system boxes working together to do real-world work. You can
find the web pages at
http://www.esd.ornl.gov/facilities/beowulf/.</p><p>I am very excited about the &ldquo;Stone SouperComputer&rdquo; project,
because for the first time it demonstrates that any university,
college, high school or even grade school can put together its own
&ldquo;Soupercomputer&rdquo; using a freely distributed operating system and
allow students to tackle the most difficult type of coding, that of
a parallel environment. It also paves the way for low-cost, highly
available, high throughput systems for research or even
administrative work.</p><p>&mdash;Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, Linux

informed us that they could in fact secure us a copy of
Microstation 95 for Linux. We have also checked with the supplier
of our current add-on software to make sure that their software for
Microstation would run on the version for Linux, and we were
informed that not only did it run on Linux, but that they had
customers already doing just that. While it is possible that the
other customers may include academia, I don't believe they all are.
This leads me to believe that, with the help of a good
re-distributor, users outside academics should be able to get a
copy. Although the distributor stressed the &ldquo;unsupported version&rdquo;
heavily, with a demand for the Linux version this may disappear.
Please keep up the great work.</p><p>&mdash;Medina County Engineers lfilak@ohio.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183f790"></a>Red Hat CDE Article</h2></div></div><p>As an owner of Red Hat/TriTeal CDE, I was interested in the
CDE article in the January 1998 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. However, I'd like to add one thing to the
article concerning the root dtlogin &ldquo;problem&rdquo;. This isn't
actually a problem, per se, it's a &ldquo;feature&rdquo;. Refusing dtlogins
by root was chosen intentionally for security reasons. However,
this feature can be disabled, as I discovered when I asked Red Hat
support about it. Here are the three things that they suggested
could be done:</p><p>1: Add <b  >dt</b> to the /etc/securetty file.2:
Remove the /etc/securetty file.3: Remove the line in the
/etc/pam.d/dtlogin file referencing secure tty.</p><p>I simply did number 1, and now I have a nice X root
login.</p><p>&mdash;Matt Harrell mharrell@voyager.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1746580.0x183fa50"></a>URL Error</h2></div></div><p>For your information, there is an incorrect URL in your

but I am curious why you did not include information on the Linux
SMP project which is at http://www.linux.org.uk/SMP/title.html?
This project is directly related to parallel processing.</p><p>Also, will <i  >LJ</i> make any future effort to

would be great.</p><p>&mdash;Steel Viper sviper@soli.inav.net</p><p>I wish we had room for everything about our focus but there
are only so many pages in a magazine. I would like articles about
SMP and the Stone Soupercomputer program mentioned above, but they
will have to be in the future. As to your second question, an
archive CD-ROM of 1994 and 1995 will be available in
March &mdash;Editor</p></div></div>
