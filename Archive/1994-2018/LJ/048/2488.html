    Presented here is an overview of the kind of remote sensing
    that is done at Southampton University and how Linux has
    helped improve our productivity.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x27a00b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The remote sensing group at Southampton
University Department of Oceanography (SUDO) works on many
different aspects of Earth observation for applications such as
climate monitoring, pollution control and general oceanography.
Linux first appeared in the Oceanography Department in 1994 and has
steadily become the workhorse OS.
</p><p>Earth observation is now a familiar topic to almost everyone.
Many of us are used to seeing satellite images of the Earth every
day whether it's in the news, TV documentaries or just the national
weather bulletin. More and more Earth observation satellites are
being launched all the time. Here at SUDO we deal primarily with
observation of the world's oceans, and we use many types of
satellite data in studying various surface features. Satellites
produce vast amounts of data, and large satellite images can be
very difficult to use for this reason. The days when a low-powered
PC could churn through a satellite dataset are long gone. Today we
are required to process more and more images as the speed of the
hardware gets faster.</p><p>We use IDL (Interactive Data Language) to process all our
satellite and meteorological data. This package is very good as it
allows us to read, warp and manipulate images easily as well as
providing lots of useful built-in math functions for detailed
analysis of our data. IDL (http://www.rsinc.com/) is now on its
fifth release and is extensively used by the satellite community
all over the world. IDL places a lot of demands on the system, so
on anything less than the quickest 486, IDL will be incredibly
slow. These days IDL is available for almost every type of
platform.</p><p>Sooner or later, when a machine is pushed to the limits to do
its job, you may have to worry about the operating system (OS) you
are using. When you are running jobs that take hours or even days
to run, the last thing you need is your system to crash or hang.
Similarly, when your system isn't fully loaded, you would like to
be able to run several jobs to make more efficient use of your
resources. A few years ago we discovered that by using Linux we
could accomplish all of this. As usual though, the change had to
come from within in order to establish Linux here and show its
strengths against systems such as MS Windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x27a02c0"></a>How We Found Linux</h2></div></div><p>When I arrived in the Department, it became apparent that I
would need a reliable method of wading though the enormous amounts
of data I was required to process. I became particularly frustrated
with the Microsoft Windows environment which frequently crashed and
gave everyone headaches. In our research we can't afford to have
our programs crashing, particularly since they take so long to run.
In those days you could perhaps process one image in an hour, if
your top-of-the-line 486 was up to it, so frequent multiple crashes
could quite easily eat up much of the day. Of course, our single
SPARC station never had these kinds of problems so there was fierce
competition between colleagues to use it. We tried at first to use
the machine remotely from our PCs using Vista Exceed. This proved
very successful at first, but eventually the SPARC station became
so overloaded with users that it was quicker to go back to using
Windows again.</p><p>Then one of our Mexican Ph.D. students, Miguel Tenorio (now
at CISESE, Ensenada in Mexico), told us of an exciting OS called
Linux which could turn a humble PC into a powerful Unix
workstation. I was very skeptical at the time and refused to
believe that the Slackware version he had running on his 386 could
possibly improve our efforts, especially since he was not able to
run X because of memory limitations. However, he proved us all
wrong later when he installed a full Slackware version with X on
one of our better 486s, and since that time we have never looked
back. Now our group has a suite of high-spec 486 and Pentium
machines running Caldera Linux and Slackware Linux and utilising
the powerful processing and data analysis power of IDL. IDL is the
software we use most for our data processing, although occasionally
we have to write the odd C program or Unix script. IDL has been
around on Unix and Windows for a long time and was recently fully
ported to Linux, much to our relief.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x27a0420"></a>Remote Sensing Applications&mdash;Global
Warming</h2></div></div><p>Global warming is a phenomenon that might very well affect us
all one day. By using data from infrared radiometers in space, we
can see how the average sea surface temperature (SST) changes over
time so we can tell from the satellite image archives whether or
not we are seeing changes in the Earth's climate. Because the ocean
has such an immense thermal capacity, even a small change (e.g.,
0.1 degrees C) in the average SST can imply a huge change in the
Earth's heat budget. Unfortunately, the SST as measured from a
satellite is a measure of the temperature of only the top
millimeter of the ocean and does not always reflect the true sea
surface temperature a few centimeters below because of the cooling
effects of the wind and evaporation. Sometimes the &ldquo;skin
temperature&rdquo; of the ocean can be as much as half a degree cooler
than that of the bulk temperature just a few centimeters below.
It's therefore important that we understand how the skin of the
ocean behaves under different meteorological conditions, so that we
can apply a correction to the satellite measured SST to account for
the variability of the temperature of the ocean skin layer. After
all, the skin temperature variability (up to 0.5 degrees C) is
larger than the sort of changes in SST we are looking to measure
for global climate research (0.1 degrees C).</p><p>The biggest source of error in estimating SST from space is
the atmospheric absorption due to water vapour in the atmosphere.
One method of dealing with this is employed by the Along Track
Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) on board the ERS-2 remote sensing
satellite. This radiometer views the sea at two different angles, 0
and 55 degrees to the vertical so that there are two images for
every patch of sea. By looking at the difference between these two
images, taken through two different thicknesses of atmosphere, a
correction factor can be calculated to adjust the images for
atmospheric absorption.</p><p>To study the atmospheric effects and the skin effect on
measuring SST from space, I use marine infrared radiometers to
measure SST at the same time as the satellites pass overhead,
thereby getting simultaneous SST measurements. The ship I use is a
ferry vessel, the MV Val de Loire (Figure 1) which sails regularly
across the English Channel. Figure 2 shows a thermal infrared
satellite image of the English Channel for January 1997 at which
time the MV Val de Loire was approaching the French coast. The
ship's radiometer and meteorological data are currently being used
to evaluate the effect of the cool ocean skin on remotely sensed
SST under a wide range of environmental conditions.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2488f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Agency</b></span></a></p><p>Using IDL under Linux I have found I can process all my data
simultaneously rather than running batch jobs that eat up the whole
DOS machine. One of the future ideas for this project is to have
the ship data telemetered back to base here in Southampton, so that
it can be processed and archived in real time rather than collected
by hand. However, we have to await further funding for that to
happen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x27a08f0"></a>Remote Sensing Applications&mdash;Synthetic Aperture
Radar Images</h2></div></div><p>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging of the Earth is
becoming increasingly popular due to the fact that these radars can
be used regardless of the atmospheric conditions&mdash;they easily
penetrate clouds, whereas clouds absorb almost all the sea surface
infrared signals of infrared imaging instruments. The SAR gathers
global information by emitting a beam of microwave radiation
towards the sea surface of the world's oceans.</p><p><a href="2488f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. SAR
Imaging European Space Agency</b></span></a></p><p>If the sea surface is smooth, i.e., calm conditions, the
surface acts like a mirror reflecting the incident beam in a
direction away from the satellite. If the sea surface is roughened
by wind or currents, then some of this incident beam is reflected
back to the satellite and is received by the SAR. Thus, the
stronger the backscattered signal, the rougher the sea
surface.</p><p>Marine surface pollution is something we see all too often on
television and in the news. The enduring images of stricken sea
birds and baby seals on oil-soaked beaches put a lot of public
pressure on environmental agencies to monitor marine pollution and
catch the culprits who may be illegally dumping oil/waste off our
shores. There is work going on in our group related to the
observation of sea surface slicks, both man-made and natural. This
type of work is suited to &ldquo;SAR&rdquo; studies.</p><p>The SAR on board the ERS-2 satellite sends images of the
ocean surface back to Earth receiving stations on a regular basis.
The SAR images reveal a surprising amount of structure on the sea
surface reflecting just how rough the sea actually is at the time
the image is acquired. Where the sea surface is rough, the radar
beam is strongly scattered back to the satellite antenna; and where
it is smooth, the beam is strongly reflected from the sea surface
away from the antenna.</p><p>Slicks have the effect of calming the sea surface and damping
wave motion thereby resulting in most of the radar beam being
reflected away from the antenna. On a SAR image, slicks typically
appear as dark patches on the sea surface corresponding to calm
conditions. Using IDL under Linux, sophisticated processing
routines have been developed that reveal slick-like features on the
sea surface and provide information about their position. Wind
speeds can also be determined from the radar backscatter which
helps to predict where the surface wind-driven currents may move
the slick. The main problem with processing this data is the image
sizes. The raw SAR images are 130MB in size and take a long time to
process before they can be displayed on the screen. Linux has
proved to be much more reliable at handling SAR data than MS
Windows, and it is much faster too.</p><p><a href="2488f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. ERS
SAR Coast of Greece, 1996 European Space
Agency</b></span></a></p><p>The scene in Figure 4 is a good SAR image of the Gulf of
Thermaikos in the Aegean Sea, just off the coast of Greece. The
image was taken by the ERS-2 SAR on 25 May 1996 at 20:43 GMT. A
number of oceanographic features evident in this image which are of
general interest. The numerous black swirls and bands across the
water surface correspond to surface slicks. Much of the slick
material comes from a river outflow at the edge of the city of
Thessaloniki, seen at the top left in the image. This reverine
material is concentrated around the top of the bay and is then
distributed throughout the gulf by eddies, tides and wind-driven
currents. Incidently, the dark square patches around the town are
probably rice fields which give very little radar return signal. In
the bottom right of the image is the edge of Mount Olympus,
mythical home of the Greek gods.</p><p><a href="2488f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5. ERS
SAR Coast of Greece, 1995 European Space
Agency</b></span></a></p><p>Figure 5 shows the same area one year earlier, but this time
there is very little of oceanographic interest in the image. The
sea appears to be bright, which implies that most of the radar
signal had been backscattered towards the SAR. This suggests that
the sea surface is very rough (wind speeds greater than 10 meters
per second), rough enough to break up any slick material and
destroy the surface signatures of eddies and weak currents. Around
some of the Eastern coastline are dark patches which correspond to
areas of water which are sheltered from the effects of the wind by
the mountains and are therefore calm, backscattering very little of
the radar beam towards the SAR.</p><p>The full potential of SAR is yet to be realised, and the
European Space Agency is keen to see the SAR data it produces fully
used. Military applications include looking for surface vessels and
the surface signatures of submarines, although here at SUDO we deal
strictly with the oceanographic science.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2797808"></a>Remote Sensing Applications&mdash;Ocean
Colour</h2></div></div><p>Modeling of phytoplankton blooms and the subsequent
chlorophyll concentrations is also done here at the University in
conjunction with satellite ocean colour data. This data reveals
information about pigment concentration that is a measure of the
biological activity in the water. The pigments are part of the
phytoplanktons' biological strategy for getting energy from
sunlight (photosynthesis) so they can live. The study of
phytoplankton blooms is very important for the study of the carbon
cycle and its global warming implications.</p><p><a href="2488f6.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 6. Ocean
Colour Image/Airborne or CZCS</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2488f7.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 7.
Thermal Image from AVHRR Satellite</b></span></a></p><p>Figure 6 shows an interesting image from the Coastal Zone
Colour Scanner (CZCS) which is an instrument which flew on the
Nimbus 7 satellite. The instrument is no longer functional but
worked well between 1978 and 1985. The image data were acquired on
14/9/80 and show the Western coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The
image shows pigment concentration during a strong upwelling event.
(Equatorward winds push the water away from the coast, and cool
water from beneath the surface is drawn upwards near the coast.)
The pigments are produced by phytoplankton.</p><p>The subsurface waters are generally cooler in the coast than
the surface and in Figure 7 this is shown on a coincident thermal
image from the AVHRR satellite as the blue, cool area. So the high
pigment concentrations in the CZCS image can be explained by the
fact that the upwelling event observed in the thermal image has led
to the pigments being brought closer to the surface where they are
more visible to the CZCS satellite instrument. Also, nutrients
upwell with the phytoplankon and as they are closer to the surface,
where there is more light, they are able to photosynthesise more
effectively and thus form large blooms. This multi-sensor approach
to oceanography (using complementary data from different sources,
e.g., WAR, thermal and visible imagery) provides a more
comprehensive view of a region than would be obtained using only
one source of data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2797bd0"></a>Specification of Workstations</h2></div></div><p>For serious image processing you need a fast machine with
good graphics support. For satellite images you also need vast
amounts of storage. So I will talk about these in turn, bearing in
mind that cost is always a factor.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2797cd8"></a>Motherboards and Processors</h2></div></div><p>At the moment Intel P200 and AMD K6 processors are very
fashionable although price-wise a P166 will give comparable
performance for much less money. It's difficult to make price
comparisons though because here in the UK electronic components are
generally more expensive than in most other countries. The Intel
430TX motherboard is generally the one I would choose at the
moment, USB and Ultra DMA support being standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2797de0"></a>Monitors and Graphics Cards</h2></div></div><p>Depending on the amount of time you spend using your machine
for graphics I would recommend at least a 17-inch colour monitor.
We do have some Illyama 21-inch monitors, but at the moment those
extra few inches double the price of the monitor. A fast graphics
card with lots of on-board RAM will make your machine update the
display much faster, especially if you are using large images. Any
S3 card (e.g., S3 trio v64+) with 2MB+ on board should give you
enough to cope with most demands, although a 4MB card should give
plenty of scope for dealing with vast displays, especially when
using the monitor at its highest resolution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2797ee8"></a>Disk Space</h2></div></div><p>Our group has about 10GB of storage space allocated on the
network server, which is almost enough. If you need speed, you need
a lot of disk space local to the machine. The local hard disks of
workstations are rarely backed up, so beware of depending on it too
much. About 3GB of hard disk space is sufficient, and these days
E-IDE is about as quick as SCSI and certainly cheaper. New IDE
disks have Ultra DMA which allows a 33MB/s transfer rate, double
that of the old IDE, although you will need at least the 430 TX
motherboard to take advantage of this rate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2797ff0"></a>CD-ROM</h2></div></div><p>Many images are now distributed on CD-ROM because it is such
a cheap way to distribute large quantities of data. A 12-speed CD
with ATAPI controller will suffice for most requirements, although
the speed of CD-ROM drives is getting faster by the month.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x27980f8"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>As I have mentioned, IDL is our favorite package for dealing
with satellite images even though many are available. Most tend to
be inflexible and tailor-made for doing specific types of image
analysis. IDL can do most of the same operations more cheaply and
flexibly while allowing you to interact with the data and merge
data from several sources. However, IDL is a programming language
in its own right, so there is a learning curve inherent to using
it.</p><p>The choice of other system components is not as critical as
choosing the video card, motherboard, processor and monitor. When
it comes to backing up our data, an Exabyte drive suits us nicely
for backing up anything less than 5GB in size.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a7580.0x2798258"></a>Further Points</h2></div></div><p>Again, IDL is the main processing software for this type of
work. Many users feel they are comfortable using LaTeX under Linux
too, although this appears to be a point of contention. Most of us
are still locked into using MS Word for want of a cheap Linux word
processor that is Word compatible and can handle multiple data
formats and equations. We are now looking at some alternatives like
Applixware.</p><p>Linux has reduced the computing cost of the Oceanography
Department's satellite remote sensing group in terms of both time
and money. Its stability has been its greatest asset in converting
die-hard Windows fanatics into potential Linux gurus. For many of
us Linux has enabled us to embark on a voyage of discovery into the
computing world. We now have a deeper understanding of how our PCs
work as Linux has brought us closer to the machine. We are
currently reviewing the hardware and software requirements of the
group for the next couple of years. We plan to continue using Linux
well into the next millennium and are quite happy with the
decision.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Acknowledgements</b></span></p><p>The SAR images in this article were obtained free from the European Space Agency.</p></div></div>
