    Mr. Komarov tells us how he used Linux to give an old
    database new capabilities and thereby saved his government
    money.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe2f580.0xf274a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recently I've found a new unusual use for
Linux, which I have used successfully at work. Here is a list of
machines and software I had to work with:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Local Ethernet network</p></li><li><p>Novell NetWare 4.10 file server</p></li><li><p>About 15 DOS/Windows workstations</p></li><li><p>Linux box as an IP router, mail server, etc.</p></li><li><p>A database application written in Clipper for
MS-DOS, which contains more than 400,000 records</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe2f580.0xf27978"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>This database application was written for a stand-alone DOS
workstation about five years ago, and the most powerful computer we
had at that time was a 386SX with 2MB of RAM. At one point we
patched this program to add a little network support. The main
database migrated to the NetWare file server, and the program
worked with the server as if it were a local drive (Z:). Data is
added to this database every day, and it has grown to more than
300MB in size. There are now 15 users connected to it, but the
program itself remains the same as it was five years ago.</p><p>Each time a user searches the database, his workstation uses
about 30 to 100MB of network traffic. The NetWare server shows 100%
utilization and searches can last for hours. One day (it was a
beautiful spring morning to be precise) my boss asked me to connect
10 more workstations to the database and to add remote access to
the database via the Internet and dial-ups. I just about had a
heart attack.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe2f580.0xf27ad8"></a>What Needed to be Done</h2></div></div><p>Of course, we needed to rewrite our database from scratch
with client server and Intranet support. Yes, we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> to, but we are a government organization
with a very limited budget. When I asked local software developers
about the possible cost for this rewrite, they told me that because
it would be a mission-critical client-server application, with
extended network and Internet support, as well as maintenance, the
price would be about $20,000 to $40,000. Now my boss had the heart
attack. That's not all&mdash;our database is very special. It was
written for very specific tasks and was tested for a long time with
bug fixes added during the experimentation period. We just couldn't
afford to write such an application ourselves from the beginning,
going through all the same problems once again. And even more&mdash;we
needed to add remote access to the database immediately, so we
needed another solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe2f580.0xf27c38"></a>The Solution</h2></div></div><p>I have used our Linux box to solve some of these problems in
the following ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>I moved the database from the NetWare file server
to Linux.</p></li><li><p>I installed the most recent version of the DOS
emulator (dosemu-0.64.3) available at that time.</p></li><li><p>After configuring and starting up the
<span   class="bold"><b>dosemu</b></span>, I mounted the directory
with my database as a local disk (Z:) in dosemu and installed the
application.</p></li><li><p>I started the application to be sure it worked&mdash;it
did.</p></li><li><p>I configured dosemu to use the exact amount of
memory my application needed, and I checked the terminal specific
configuration lines in the dosemu configuration file.</p></li><li><p>I made a TELNET connection to my site and started
dosemu with my application&mdash;this also worked.</p></li><li><p>I made a dial-up connection to Linux and started
dosemu from the shell prompt with the application&mdash;it worked
again.</p></li><li><p>I started X using
<span   class="bold"><b>xdos</b></span>--another success. Oops, now I
was running four copies of my application at once.</p></li><li><p>Last, I shared the database directory via Samba or
MARS_NWE (NetWare server emulator for Linux), mounted it on the
other workstations as a normal database disk, and it worked that
way too.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe2f580.0xf28478"></a>Perceived Gains</h2></div></div><p>Our DOS/Windows workstations can continue using the database
in the old manner. All that has changed is that the file server for
the database is now Linux, and clients can be connected to the
database not only via NetWare protocol but also via the Microsoft
Network using Samba&mdash;not bad.</p><p>Since more than one copy of the DOS emulator can be run at
one time on Linux, it is possible for users to access the database
from the Linux console, the X Window System, an X terminal, a
serial terminal, a remote TELNET connection and a remote dial-up
connection. Note that if the database application is started from
dosemu, it works 10 times faster because, in this case, it uses
data not on the network but on a local drive.</p><p>After using this configuration for about two months, I've
found running the application from dosemu on Linux is more stable
than running it from Windows 3.11. There are some tricks to prevent
data loss in case of a broken remote connection to dosemu. By the
way, while experimenting with MARS_NWE, I found it to be very
stable, powerful and fast. Data transfer speed from Linux via
MARS_NWE remains almost as fast as it was from the native NetWare
4.10 file server, so users connected from DOS/Windows workstations
do not see much difference. And all this was accomplished during
one night without any programming or additional capital
investment.</p></div></div>
