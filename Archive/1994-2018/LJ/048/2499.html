    Linux is a good business product. This article deals with
    the why, how and who of selling Linux.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2499f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x135e580.0x1456558"></a></h2></div></div><p> I have a standard Linux sales pitch that
goes like this: &ldquo;Linux is not what it was, but what it has come to
be. Born of an idea by Linus Torvalds, evolving from infancy as an
OS just powerful enough to control a disk drive, it grew into a
very powerful, Unix-like operating system with the ability to meet
the needs of such demanding users as medical centers, theoretical
physicists and communication corporations, as well as the more
modest needs of small businesses and end users. Linux offers you
the power to accomplish whatever task you may have at hand with
unparalleled stability and reasonable ease of operation. Software
is abundant, help is as close as the Internet, and the potential is
limited only by your imagination and computing skill. The bottom
line is that this incredibly flexible and powerful OS is free.&rdquo;
</p><p>What I like about selling Linux systems is that my sales
pitch is absolutely true. I haven't embellished anything in order
to score a sale. I have given the client the whole truth and
nothing else. From that modest beginning, I can listen to the
client's needs and design a Linux system tailored to meet them.
Tucked into a spare bedroom, my small business,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cybertronics</em></span>
(http://cwolf.uaa.alaska.edu/~asacs7/main.htm), is not a
Microsoft-sized operation by any means. From my home workshop I
conduct repairs of various electronic equipment from TVs to
computers, build customized systems and maintain contact with the
array of suppliers, clients and persons to whom I contract out
various jobs. My partner, my wife, manages the paperwork end of the
business, and I run the technical side.</p><p>One would think in this day and age of big conglomerates
taking over the technology industry, that small businesses like
mine would be rapidly shoved out of the way or swallowed up, but
Linux is an asset that has allowed us to remain competitive. I
offer an unusual, powerful product. The open source code allows
this OS to be customized for whatever specific uses a client might
have. And the fact that it is free allows my prices to remain
extremely competitive.</p><p>I have come to specialize more and more in Linux systems, and
I hope within a year or two to focus on Linux systems as my primary
commercial product. That will all depend on how Linux continues to
evolve, as the literature I have read on the Internet indicates the
OS is again at a crossroads and experiencing the associated growing
pains. On the Internet, two opposing sides can be seen arguing over
the way Linux should go in the future as it continues to grow and
become more powerful. On the one hand, those opposed to the
simplification of Linux usage to expand its mass appeal argue the
OS should remain complex to force the user to learn something and
ensure that only dedicated computer hobbyists and aficionados will
use it. On the other hand there are those that would have the
development of Linux travel down a road of utter ease so that it
resembles Windows 95. At <span   class="emphasis"><em>cybertronics</em></span>, I have
drawn my own conclusions (and sell Linux systems by them) based on
the hard practicality that makes business work:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux is a powerful OS. It has been so for a long
time. But it is only recently, due to advances made largely by Red
Hat and Caldera in making Linux more user friendly, that it has
become a truly marketable product to a diverse client base.</p></li><li><p>The growth of Linux and related software depends on
the mass acceptance of the OS. The more users there are, the more
people and companies will be turning out applications and making
improvements.</p></li><li><p>The option of simplification is a good thing,
</p><p>as long as Linux is left with enough complexity to make the
full power of the OS available for those users who desire or demand
that kind of control. It is also desirable to leave that power and
intimate control capability in place, right down to manipulation of
the source code, to maintain the unique flavor and spirit of
Linux.</p></li></ul></div><p>Linux is now at this crossroads. Simplification has been
added so the end user can use the system, while full control can be
accessed by the experienced user for greater power and enhancement
of the OS. This is what makes Linux different and marketable today
to a broad range of clients. I can sell it to an average end user
who simply wants a good, inexpensive system to balance his books,
do word processing or access the Internet&mdash;and this represents the
majority of computer users&mdash;because it has become relatively easy
to use. I can also sell it to a client who must maintain a huge
database of corporate records or run a powerful web server because
that power is also easily accessible. Because Linux currently
maintains a healthy balance of end user simplicity and ultimate
user control, it is a highly attractive product to a wide range of
people.</p><p>The second aspect of Linux which I emphasize strongly to my
clients is the incredible stability of the system. I own three
computers: an AMD-based system, a Cyrix-based system and an older
Intel-based system. Linux has never crashed on any of these. On a
couple of occasions, applications have misbehaved or have closed
down, but this always turned out to be the result of a poorly
programmed application, a user error, or the program's use of some
new, experimental aspect of Linux that hadn't yet been tested and
proven. But never, in all the time I have used Linux, have I seen
it crash a system due to an instability problem. For businesses
that believe time is money, stability is a major advantage. When
computers crash, businesses lose not only the unbacked-up data on
the system, but also time paid to employees while they wait for the
system to come back on-line. If a network server crashes or becomes
unstable, it can cost many thousands of dollars as computers
throughout the company are affected. Even worse, customers tend to
have little tolerance for businesses with faulty equipment. They
will take their business elsewhere, sometimes for good.</p><p>A third and extremely important point in selling Linux is all
of the software that is available, most of which is free. I have
tried on several occasions to search the Internet for all Linux
software to develop a comprehensive list for my clients. But the
list is always growing and changing. And there is just so much
software out there, much of which is good yet hard to find, that
I've given up creating a comprehensive list. I doubt there is
enough time in a month of Sundays to gather up Internet addresses
to all the software and evaluate everything I can find for Linux
that is free. This brings up an important point.</p><p>From the standpoint of business, professional software that
is designed and sold commercially for Linux is extremely
affordable, such as the office suites sold by Caldera (Star Office)
and Red Hat (Applixware). In many cases, a company can purchase and
outfit an entire network with professional quality productivity
software that takes advantage of the full networking, stability and
processing power of Linux for less than a thousand dollars. This
selling point is truly great. The trouble is, it sounds too good to
be true. You know the old adage, &ldquo;You never get something for
nothing.&rdquo; Well, business people tend to be very cautious with
money (especially the small to medium-sized businesses I often work
with), and they become dubious at hearing how Linux can offer so
much for so little. This point in the pitch is a good place to have
references and demo software available, and it is also an
especially important place to understand the aspects of Linux that
make such high quality so affordable.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Linux OS is free and freely developed by
computer program developers around the world. Therefore, there are
no royalties to be paid by software companies making professional
business software, and development costs are cut to almost
nothing.</p></li><li><p>Companies producing Linux software for profit are
engaged in hard competition with software giants, including
Microsoft, and are turning out superb products to gain an edge
since they cannot compete in financial and advertising
resources.</p></li><li><p>The spirit of free software is active even in the
businesses involved with Linux. While those businesses are not
running charities, they help promote the growth of Linux by making
their products more widely available through reasonable prices&mdash;and
anyone familiar with the Unix business knows that the price tag
behind that OS and its software has killed its presence in the
end-user market (a sad way for such a fine OS to go).</p></li></ul></div><p>The only downside I have found is that for the private
consumer wanting a more powerful computer system, professional
Linux software is often too expensive. More competitively priced
items are available for Windows for many applications&mdash;but this is
changing. Caldera makes Star Office freely available to private
users. Also, I have found a number of practical, good applications
available at more reasonable prices within the last
year&mdash;everything from web design software to data backup
tools.</p><p>Moving on, it is important to note in selling Linux that
there are many less obvious reasons for a client to turn to a Linux
system.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The way Linux manages memory is very effective. No
need to worry about high memory and low memory&mdash;Linux uses it
all.</p></li><li><p>Linux's ability to communicate with other operating
systems enhances its flexibility.</p></li><li><p>Linux's efficient and powerful programming enhances
its speed.</p></li><li><p>Source code availability allows Linux to be
entirely customized to fit the needs of the user.</p></li><li><p>A good distribution of Linux comes with so much
free software that a business can often find most of the
applications it needs on the Linux CD.</p></li></ul></div><p>For the business person considering marketing any product, a
question as important as &ldquo;What product shall I sell?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Who
shall I sell it to?&rdquo; One would think with the broad potential for
client usage I have described above, that anyone who uses a
computer would be a potential client. In some ways I have found
that to be true. I have sold Linux to casual end users who want
more power than an old DOS-based system has to offer. I have also
sold it to people who just want to learn what makes their computers
tick. I have found that to compete, Linux must and does appeal to
certain groups of people in particular. Since advertising costs
what it does, it is important to target your business' ads and make
each dollar count.</p><p>Is Linux a gamer's OS of choice? I am sorry, but it's not.
Yes, there are a lot of games out there for Linux. Unfortunately,
most of them are reminiscent of the earlier days of computing when
two dimensional arcade-style games like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Asteroids</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Space
Invaders</em></span> were the rage. There are some other, more
advanced games, I'll grant you, like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>.
But Linux is really lacking in the intense, power demanding,
multimedia games that are available these days for other systems.
And, let's face it, currently Linux is too demanding for the needs
of someone who only wants a super gaming machine. And that is, in
my opinion, too bad, because Linux has so much power and stability
to offer. On other platforms, games crash or move jerkily. Both are
frustrating, and I believe that Linux harnessed for such
applications would make the ultimate gamer's computer.</p><p>Nor is Linux the first choice for the end user who wants as
little to do with his computer as possible. One of my best
customers, an elderly gentleman who has been coming to me for a
couple of years now, wants his computer to get his stock quotes and
publish his letters&mdash;that's all. The learning curve of Linux is
still too high for him. He wants to do his work, and then get off
his computer. He calls me from time to time with frustrations about
how his current OS has led to another computer crash, but the
occasional crash is an easier burden for him to bear than learning
even the simplest administration of a Linux system. Until a shell
for Linux is created which greatly simplifies its usage for the
least demanding of end users, Linux will not appeal to this
market.</p><p>My primary sales strategy is aimed at end users who want a
system strictly for some form of business, be it personal
bookkeeping, writing or running their small business. They like
Linux because of the strong sales points I have already mentioned.
Linux's stability ensures against losing time or work and is the
biggest selling point for these individuals. Often they run their
businesses with little or no help. They need to get things done.
They don't have time to waste. That stability helps ensure that
they will be able to do their jobs in the least amount of time so
they can move on to other projects.</p><p>For representatives of larger companies, power is the factor
to emphasize. Knowing that they can take this OS and put it to
serious work, thereby saving their companies thousands of dollars
by not buying commercial operating systems such as Windows NT or
some other Unix is very impressive. Of course, the stability of
Linux is also appealing to them. It is like icing on an already
delicious cake.</p><p>Certainly, there are many other people for whom Linux could
prove to be a useful and desirable product. However, the two groups
I have just mentioned form the lion's share of my Linux business,
and they are the market segment where, in my experience,
advertising dollars should be aimed. At this time, these two groups
comprise the broadest consumer market to which Linux seems most
appropriately tailored. Both of these groups represent practical
people with things to do.</p><p>I have found a brief, one page brochure with lots of
illustrations that quickly and plainly point out the facts is a
great way to introduce clients to the idea of a system based on
Linux. If they are interested, I will happily take a system to
their place of work and demonstrate it along with the features that
make it particularly beneficial to them. I keep these presentations
to fifteen minutes unless they indicate a desire to go deeper into
the system. I can expand these presentations as needed to give
potential customers all the information they want.</p><p>Since Linux is a complicated system, I deliver a Linux
computer to the client already configured. I maintain good
communication with these busy people by regular follow-up to make
sure everything is going according to their expectations, and I go
the extra mile to help them incorporate their Linux computer into
their business as a vital and necessary component of
administration. The most common complaint I hear from any of my
customers is, &ldquo;I've found something I just can't understand,&rdquo; so
I offer up to six free hours of consultation to help my clients
over the obstacles that inevitably crop up.</p><p>Finally, you wouldn't attempt to fly without a little formal
training. Nor would you buy a new car and not receive an owner's
manual so you could learn how to take care of it. Well, in the same
way, I don't turn over systems without documentation. My systems
come with a copy of an easy to read, good reference on Linux. Que's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Using Linux</em></span> by Jack Tackett, Jr. and Dave
Gunter (1997) has proven especially useful in that respect. To get
my clients excited about their Linux system, I also give them a
free issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> as a way of
introducing them to the growing world of Linux users everywhere
that they have just entered.</p><p>Linux is a fine and marketable product. At
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cybertronics</em></span>, I foresee a bright future for
the OS and for businesses marketing and selling it. It is my hope
that Linux will continue to evolve, becoming easier for everyone to
use and maintain while retaining all of its power and
accessibility. With this combination and a little enthusiasm, Linux
can rekindle the days of the eighties when computer companies
sprung from home basement workshops and pioneered new
frontiers.</p></div></div>
