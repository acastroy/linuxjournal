one of the flagship applications has been the &ldquo;grand old man&rdquo; of
PC word processing, WordPerfect. Originally, Caldera had ported
WordPerfect 6 to their commercial Linux distribution. This port
apparently did well enough to convince Corel, the current owners of
the product line, that there was a market worth their efforts. They
farmed out the port to Software Development Corporation, but Corel
markets the results, WordPerfect 7 for Linux, directly as well as
through SDC's web site.</p><p>WordPerfect 7 for Linux, I'm pleased to say, is very
good&mdash;certainly good enough for me to finally abandon Windows as a
word processing environment. It has few problems (no show-stoppers)
and a reasonable price tag.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106a9d0"></a>Getting the Program</h2></div></div><p>There are two ways to obtain the program: downloading off the
Net or ordering a CD. In both cases, you get a completely
functional program with all its features but only a 15-day
evaluation license. I thought this was a nice compromise between
the commercial nature of the program and the freely available
software model the Linux community is used to. This evaluation
version is entirely free if you get it off the Net; you can also
pay about $30 US to have a CD shipped to you. I tend to prefer to
have the disk around, so I tested both the CD and the network
installation.</p><p>If you decide to keep WordPerfect, a single-user license is
$199 US&mdash;about $100 US less than for current versions of
WordPerfect on other platforms, including other Unix platforms.
This pricing also seems to be aimed at a compromise between the two
mindsets. While not willing to give the license away, Corel is
interested enough in the Linux community to offer an attractively
low price.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106ab30"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Whether you grab it off the Net or opt for the CD,
installation is fairly easy, as you would expect these days. If you
choose to download, you will need to do a little more work. You
will also need a lot more disk space to store both the distribution
and the installation, but the former can be erased or archived as
soon as you're satisfied with your setup. You will need between 50
and 150MB of disk space available for the final installation,
depending on the options you select.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106ac38"></a>Installing from the Net</h2></div></div><p>Getting the necessary files off the Internet is just a matter
of linking to the right web site. In this case, you want to go to
http://www.sdcorp.com/ or http://www.corel.com/. It's a little
faster to navigate SDC's web site. SDC's main page has a link for
&ldquo;WordPerfect for Linux&rdquo; that leads to the registration and
download pages for the evaluation copy. It also leads to pages that
allow you to actually purchase a license or purchase the CD from
one of their resellers.</p><p>Once you have the files you need (and it will take a while,
even on a fast link), make a directory and unpack the files
(<b  >tar xzf</b> should do the trick for each of them).
Note that, unlike most GNU packages and other software you get off
the Net these days, these tar files do not create a directory for
you, so be careful.</p><p>When done, you will have a number of cryptically named files
and a completely obvious &ldquo;Runme&rdquo; file. Execute &ldquo;Runme&rdquo; as root,
and it will walk you though the installation with either a decently
thought-out graphical interface or a bearable character interface,
depending on whether or not your X server is running at the time
and whether root currently has permission to display. If you're
running XDM with its default configuration, and log in as a regular
user and use <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> to get root access, root will
not have permission to display by default. You can either use the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xhost `cat hostname`
</pre><p>before invoking su to add the entire local host, or use this
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xauth merge ~yourusername/.Xauthority
</pre>


as root to give root access to the necessary keys. Both are kind of
cheating, and you'll probably want to undo them (by using
<b  >xhost -</b> or removing /root/.Xauthority) when
you're finished. Both methods are almost identical in what they let
you do.
</p><p>When the installation is complete, you will find that all of
those cryptically named files now have .bk extensions added. The
files themselves haven't changed at all, but if you find you need
to reinstall or wish to change installation options, you will need
to move these files back to their original names before running
&ldquo;Runme&rdquo; again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b0b0"></a>Installing from the CD</h2></div></div><p>Installation from the CD is much simpler. Mount the CD the
way you would any other CD-ROM, change to the mount directory and
execute install.wp as root. This is basically the identical program
to &ldquo;Runme&rdquo; above, except that the distribution is formatted
differently. The resulting installation will be identical if the
same options are selected.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b1b8"></a>Running the Program</h2></div></div><p>First of all, even if you installed via the character-based
interface, make sure your X server is running when you go to run
the program. WordPerfect for Linux absolutely requires the X Window
System to run. Most other WordPerfect for Unix distributions
include a character-based version (ah, function keys), but the
Linux distribution does not at this time. It hasn't been ruled out
for the future; it's just not currently included. I gather they
want to see how the &ldquo;main&rdquo; product does first, and then see what
demand there is for the character-based version. I, for one,
wouldn't mind having the option, but I don't fault them for their
caution.</p><p>Once the program is installed, make sure you have its binary
directory in your path (if you installed in /usr/wp, you want
/usr/wp/wpbin/ in your path) and run
<span   class="bold"><b>xwp</b></span>. You should see a splash
screen within a second, a small window with two menu items shortly
after that, and a large new document window a second or so later.
To add a comparative note here, I found WordPerfect's start-up time
to be remarkably fast compared to StarOffice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b370"></a>The Good</h2></div></div><p>At this point, if you've ever used any of the modern Windows
or Macintosh word processors, you should be right at home.
WordPerfect for Linux has all of the features of WordPerfect 7 for
other platforms, including simple drawing and charting modules,
spelling and grammar checking, auto-correct and spell-as-you-go
highlighting, tables, mail merge, outlining, lists and style
sheets. This is a complete implementation of the feature set people
have come to expect in a word processor.</p><p>For all of that, somehow, the program manages to not be a
complete memory hog. While typing this review, I found that the
program had a resident set size of only 5.5MB, while a small daemon
that runs concurrently (<span   class="bold"><b>wpexc</b></span>)
took up a mere 416K&mdash;not exactly svelte, but not bloated by today's
standards either. These numbers basically mean that I can run the
program on my small 16MB laptop without swapping. To get
comparative again: while I do not remember the exact resident set
size of StarOffice, I do remember quite clearly that it swapped
like crazy when handling anything more than just typing.</p><p>The secret seems in part to be that SDC has taken advantage
of the Unix model and split a lot of the &ldquo;under-the-hood&rdquo;
functionality out into separate programs. The grammar and spell
checkers, for example, are each a separate binary, and so are many
of the file conversion filters. Some of these can even be run
independently of WordPerfect from the command line. The result is
that most of the time all that needs to be in memory is the basic
interface to handle commands and typing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b580"></a>Ease of Use</h2></div></div><p>If you need to get started quickly, WordPerfect is a definite
winner. Although the default text style is not the best for a
document, reformatting is simple enough that you can just start
typing and worry about it later.</p><p>At any given time, the right mouse button will bring up a
handy menu of common formatting commands. In addition, the
paragraph the mouse pointer currently points to will always have a
small button next to it. Pressing this button brings up a small
window with just the paragraph formatting commands.</p><p>If you have Spell-As-You-Go (the name of the feature that
highlights misspelled words) turned on, the menu that appears when
you right-click over a highlighted word changes to provide
suggestions for replacements. You also are given the choice to add
the word to the dictionary right then or to bring up the full spell
checker.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b738"></a>Word Processing with Style</h2></div></div><p>Even the simplest word processors these days have style
sheets, although they all handle them a bit differently.
WordPerfect's handling falls into the middle range, in my opinion,
for ease of use. What keeps it from a better rating is the sheer
complexity of the underlying style-sheet model, and an interface
that does not seem to have been completely thought out from the
user's point of view. There are several different kinds of styles:
character, paragraph and document, and several different
&ldquo;locations&rdquo; where style sheets can reside: single document,
personal style-sheet library, system library. Users have to pay
very careful attention to these details, particularly if they want
a single style sheet to be used in several documents (for example,
the chapters of a book). In some cases, however, it's not entirely
obvious how to set the options you need.</p><p>The other complication is an historical artifact of
WordPerfect itself. WordPerfect is still code driven; that is, it
performs stylistic changes by transparently marking up text with
bracketing tags, much like HTML. It is, in fact, still possible to
tell WordPerfect to show you these codes in your
document&mdash;WordPerfect old-timers will be familiar with the &ldquo;Reveal
Codes&rdquo; feature.</p><p>The window that lets you actually manipulate a style either
shows you these codes to tell you which features you've selected or
shows you nothing at all. To a user more familiar with Microsoft
Word or StarOffice, this can be quite confusing; the more so since
the user really doesn't need to know about the codes. It would have
been just as useful to list which features had been set up for a
given style, leaving &ldquo;Reveal Codes&rdquo; as an option for the power
user.</p><p>To WordPerfect's credit, there is a &ldquo;QuickStyle&rdquo; option
that simply creates a style based on the current formatting under
the insertion point. So, a user could type a document, change the
style of one paragraph using the normal formatting commands until
satisfied, then invoke the Styles feature and select QuickStyle.
After that, a Select All followed by selecting the new Style would
apply the style throughout the document.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106b948"></a>The Need for Speed</h2></div></div><p>I'd like to be able to say that WordPerfect is a complete
speed demon, but it's not quite. Many operations are fast, to be
certain (spell-check, for example, is quite speedy), but some
others seem slow, at least on my laptop (a Pentium 120, 16MB,
Xfree86 and later Accelerated X LX 4.1). Just typing seemed to lag
under Xfree86, although it's much improved under Accelerated X.
Even under that server, however, typing is sometimes sluggish,
especially when inserting into the middle of a paragraph. No
characters are actually lost, but it's not quite as fast as I would
expect.</p><p>I found there were certain things I could do to speed it up.
Turning off Spell-As-You-Go was a big help. Also, reconfiguring the
status bar at the bottom of the window to not display full position
information helped by eliminating a redraw for every
character.</p><p>I've also found that plugging in my laptop, rather than
running off the battery, speeds things up; this is not surprising,
since most portables have an automatic &ldquo;slow down&rdquo; mode for
saving power. This, of course, is not WordPerfect's problem. Even
so, word processors have been keeping up with people since long
before the Pentium era, so I wouldn't necessarily expect the slight
power-saving slow down to be so noticeable.</p><p>My speed problems were not entirely consistent, and I did not
do a very scientific examination of exactly what was going on when
the program became slow.</p><p>Even when WordPerfect is feeling sluggish, however, it's
still thoroughly usable. In fact, if you are the sort of typist who
has been trained not to look at the keyboard or screen while typing
but rather at your source material or some other neutral point, you
probably won't even notice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x106bbb0"></a>Clunkers</h2></div></div><p>Although I find the program mostly satisfactory, with all the
features I might want and quite a few I can take or leave, I have
found a few problems that I can only call &ldquo;clunkers&rdquo;. None of
them prevent the successful use of the program as a whole, but they
do make certain features difficult or impossible to use, and that,
of course, detracts from the overall attractiveness of the
product.</p><p>The first problem I noticed was that the on-line help system
did not seem to work on my portable, although it had worked fine on
another system I'd tried it on. It turned out that my locale
information was set to &ldquo;us&rdquo; rather than C, which is the usual
default. The on-line help seems to crash when faced with a locale
it doesn't know about. This is arguably a case of user error, but
it seems to me that the help program could simply fall back to a
reasonable default rather than crashing.</p><p>The second problem I had is that the HTML export feature does
not seem to work consistently. When I tried exporting this document
to HTML, it worked just fine. However, when I begin by importing
some (but not all) existing HTML documents, I find that I
absolutely cannot export them&mdash;the file comes up blank. I've
reported this problem, and hopefully it will be tracked down
soon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf72580.0x10625f8"></a>The Last Word</h2></div></div><p>WordPerfect 7 for Linux is an excellent effort, fairly
stable, reasonably fast and contains everything people have come to
expect in a word processing program. It works fine in relatively
low memory conditions (a rarity in commercial applications these
days) and on relatively low-end hardware. In fact, from the low-end
standpoint, the only thing that would make it better would be to
include the character-based version, so that low-end users would
not have to use the X Window System at all.</p><p>While it does have its problems, WordPerfect successfully
proves that it is possible to write commercial software for a free
operating system and also provides one more excellent weapon in the
struggle for freedom from the Microsoft Empire. I'm pleased to say
that, with WordPerfect now installed on my Linux partition, I have
only two reasons to use That Other Operating System at all:
Dramatica (an excellent program for working out the details of a
story, which I am trying to convince Screenplay Systems to port to
Linux), and Jedi Knight.</p><p>Software Development Corporation and Corel: my hat's off to
you. Good work.</p></div></div>
