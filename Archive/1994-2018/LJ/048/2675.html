    Mr. Eid began work for Corel Corporation in 1989 and eventually
    rose
    to the position of Vice President of Technology.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28af580.0x29a73f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In October of last year, Corel Computer
Corporation announced that its newest computer, the Corel Video
Network Computer, would come with the Linux operating system
installed. Wanting to know more, I asked for and was granted an
e-mail interview with Corel's President, Mr. Eid Eid. This
interview took place December 1, 1997.</p><p>Mr. Eid began work for Corel Corporation in 1989 and
eventually rose to the position of Vice President of Technology. As
Vice President, Eid was in charge of the development of all Corel
products, including CorelDRAW, the Corel WordPerfect Suite and
CorelVIDEO. In mid-1997, Mr. Eid was appointed to the presidency of
the newly formed Corel Computer Corp., located in downtown Ottawa,
Canada.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: The Linux
community is quite excited about your new Video Network Computer.
Exactly what is a Video Network Computer? What are some of its
features?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: I want to try to
resolve some of the misinformation about network computers before
talking about what we are doing at Corel Computer. The concept of a
network computer is very simple; let me explain.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A network computer should be based on an open
software and hardware architecture.</p></li><li><p>It should have a lower cost of ownership than a
PC.</p></li><li><p>It should allow for centralized software
distribution and centralized hardware management.</p></li><li><p>It should increase network and data
security.</p></li></ul></div><p>Corel Computer has adhered to these concepts and developed a
number of features that enhance the image of an NC. In fact, our
goal was to dispel the reputation that network computers lack the
performance and power of PC products.
</p><p>The Corel Video Network Computer includes a Digital StrongARM
processor that is clocked at 233MHz and delivers 250 MIPS. This is
equivalent in horsepower to the Pentium II processor but at the
power consumption of a night-light.</p><p>The processing power of the machine allows us to deliver
high-end multimedia to a networked desktop. We have included a
Persistent Cache or hard drive that minimizes network traffic,
improves performance and allows users to work off-line should a
server go down. We have designed and integrated software for
greater performance and consistency. And what amazes us most is the
size of the device: it measures about the size of a small hardcover
book.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What factors
influenced you to choose Linux as your operating system of
choice?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: Corel Computer reviewed
many operating systems from most major vendors but selected Linux
for some tangible and some intangible reasons. The concrete reasons
why Linux has millions of supporters, including Corel Computer, are
because it is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Highly stable</p></li><li><p>Robust</p></li><li><p>Multitasking and multithreading</p></li><li><p>Small of footprint</p></li><li><p>Supported by thousands of developers
worldwide</p></li></ul></div><p>However, Linux offers some benefits that go beyond
technology. Primarily, Linux is a highly accessible operating
system. Sure it is freely available, and in the case of Linux, this
means that the users and developers have access to the best
technology as soon as they need it, not when a big software
developer gets around to releasing the next upgrade. For example,
when Corel Computer decided to use the StrongARM processor, Linux
was the only serious OS that had binaries available for this chip.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What is your
targeted market? Who do you expect will be buying this
machine?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: In the short term we
are marketing the machine in three fundamental ways. First, we are
positioning the machine as a corporate and institutional product
that addresses the need for low-cost, high-value, network
computing. Customers will have a choice of a Java-based user
interface or a Linux-based browser interface. The main applications
for such a device will be to access and gather information,
communicate and collaborate. We expect that some companies will use
the Corel Video Network Computer to replace aging terminals or
older PCs, and that other companies will use the network computer
to extend computing services to employees who do not currently have
access to any.</p><p>Secondly, we are leveraging our existing communication
experience and offering a compelling solution for LAN-based
communications. In response to customer feedback, the device is
being offered with a Java-based, integrated communications suite
and user interface. Customers will be able to centralize audio,
video and data communications into a single networked
device.</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, we are going to position the
device as a Linux workstation for Linux and Java developers. The
machine will include a software development kit, documentation,
support and discounts on the hardware for developers. We plan to
announce the details of our developer's program early in the new
year.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How much will
these computers cost? When will we be able to buy one?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: The initial design will
cost about $1,000 US and will ship early in 1998. This product will
include a keyboard and mouse, and integrated Java-based software
running on the Linux OS. However, what we want to sell is the idea
that the device will cost less to operate, manage and maintain than
a PC. For example, we are currently evaluating the energy
consumption of our NC compared to a PC. Our initial results
indicate that the savings on an electric bill could be as much as
$200 per year per network computer. Furthermore, the productivity
enhancements achieved by users will all but pay for the initial
cost of the machine. For example, users will no longer be
responsible for the management of &ldquo;corporate information&rdquo;
residing on their computer. Because files are stored on a central
server, the loss to the company should a machine be accidentally
damaged is the cost of a new network computer. However, if a PC is
damaged, all the information that is stored on the PC could be lost
for good.</p><p>The Linux workstation that I mentioned before will ship in
the spring of 1998. We are planning to include more memory, a
larger hard drive and a faster chip in the Linux workstation.
Although we have not set the price of this device, it may be closer
to $1,500 US because of these enhancements.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: What flavor of
Linux will be on the workstations?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: As a basis for our
development, we used two sources under GPL. A large part of the OS
is based on pieces from Red Hat and Russell King, an independent
developer who has ported much of the recent Red Hat releases to the
ARM chip. Corel Computer has been developing, modifying and porting
the two sources to the StrongARM chip and configuring the OS to run
the Corel Computer NC peripherals. Corel Computer will follow all
the rules of GPL and will publish the source code and diff files
when the machine is shipped.</p><p>We are committed to returning the development work that we
have done to the Linux community.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How many of
Corel's products support Linux at this time? Will those products
not currently supported be ported to Linux soon?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: Currently, Corel
WordPerfect 7 has been ported to Linux 2.0.25. Corel is continuing
to study this market with input from partners like Caldera and
input from customers. The feedback to this point has been that
Linux users are looking for unique and compelling products, not
necessarily product ports from Windows.</p><p>What is highly encouraging is that Java running in the Linux
environment offers the opportunity to begin to address some of
these customer demands. Corel Computer has been spearheading
development work on Linux running on the StrongARM chip. This
includes championing development on Sun's Java Application
Environment for this combination. What this means is that Linux
users can begin to develop for, or take advantage of, new
Java-based products.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us a bit
about your Java-based multimedia software.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: Corel Computer will
continue to use the Java programming language to integrate products
onto the Corel Video Network Computer. The first product, codenamed
&ldquo;Cabot&rdquo;, is one part of a much larger strategy being implemented
by Corel Corp. Corel is dedicated to being an industry leader in
the field of web and Java-based communications and groupware
applications. The products that we have announced are being
designed to leverage network-centric, thin-client computing.</p><p>Besides advancing the Linux OS and developing new tools for
Java development, Corel Computer has created a software product
that automatically increases the value of the network computer.
Cabot is an HTML and Java-based user interface and communications
suite for the Corel Video Network Computer. The product
includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A Java-based browser</p></li><li><p>A PIM</p></li><li><p>An HTML editor</p></li><li><p>An e-mail client</p></li><li><p>A file manager and file browser</p></li><li><p>And much more...</p></li></ul></div><p>Our parent company, Corel, will offer the Corel Video Network
Computer and its software as part of a broader corporate solution.
Corel is designing new software to complement its complete
business, graphics and Internet applications. First, Corel is
developing Java technology that will allow existing applications
such as Corel WordPerfect or Microsoft Office to run on a server
and be accessed via a thin client on any Java Virtual Machine. This
product will ship early in 1998. Second, Corel is producing a new
line of products that will focus on information management and
knowledge gathering and publishing. This product will be modular
and lightweight, and will ship in the summer of 1998.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Any other exciting
projects involving Linux (or not) coming up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: We hope to be able to
announce a formal relationship between Corel Computer and Sun
Microsystems in the coming weeks. This announcement will pertain to
the Java Application Environment running on Linux. We also hope to
formalize our relationship with Caldera and announce exciting new
projects that are in the works between our two companies.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: How about a short
history of Corel Corp. and Corel Computer? Where you started, where
you are now...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: The history of Corel is
very interesting, but very extensive. There are many highlights
from the past 12 years, but I think that the most notable
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>1985</b></span>: Corel
Systems Corp. founded by Dr. Michael Cowpland. The company was
producing a PC system for desktop publishing using Ventura and
WordPerfect. As the saying goes, Michael liked the products so much
he later bought the companies.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>1989</b></span>: A drawing
product was designed by Corel engineers and was expected to sell a
couple hundred copies. CorelDRAW has sold more than 7 million
stand-alone copies, and millions more have been shipped with PCs
since its launch.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>1992</b></span>: CorelDRAW 3
is the first software suite ever sold. The package included DRAW,
PhotoPaint and a raft of multimedia accessories. It also marked the
first product to have mass distribution on CD-ROM.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>1995</b></span>: CorelDRAW 6
is the first major 32-bit application to ship for Windows
95.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>1996</b></span>: Corel buys
WordPerfect from Novell. Since that time, Corel has shipped two
major upgrades to the product in addition to increasing
cross-platform support by offering new versions on DOS, Windows 3.1
and Unix.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>1997</b></span>: Launch of
Corel Computer Corp. We are currently 90 employees including
students, contractors and full-time employees. We have separate
offices in Ottawa but are connected to Corel through desktop video
conferencing, direct dial telephone and a shared WAN. Dr. Michael
Cowpland is the chairman of the new company.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
What do you see in the future for Corel and Linux?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Eid</b></span>: It is very exciting to
be involved with an active and stimulating community. It is a
diverse community with a breadth of experience. I hope that Corel
Computer can help champion the operating system and the development
language and steward new directions based in Java. I know many of
us at Corel Computer look forward to traveling to meet with user
and developer groups over the coming months.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thank you very
much for your time.</p></div></div>
