    How a lab at Queen's University is using Linux to develop
    programs and control hardware experiments.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x229f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Mathematics and Engineering program
at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario operates a control and
robotics laboratory as part of the course offerings in the control
systems area. The lab experiments use our custom-built
electro-mechanical setups and require the students to write
algorithms in C for controlling the hardware.
</p><p>The lab began using C under DOS as the software environment
for the lab experiments, but not all students had an easy time with
the environment. Generally, it was too easy for configuration files
to be inadvertently changed with frustrating consequences.
Subsequently, an integrated experiment environment known as
<span   class="bold"><b>dlxlab</b></span> has been developed for
simulating and running control lab experiments. It consists of a
single program, run as <span   class="bold"><b>dlxsim</b></span> for
simulations or as <span   class="bold"><b>dlxrun</b></span> for
controlling hardware experiments. The program was developed using
the XView toolkit under Linux (see &ldquo;Programming with XView&rdquo; by
Michael Hall, <i  >LJ</i>, March 1998), and operates in
the lab on a variety of PC-compatible hardware running Linux
1.2.13.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x229f710"></a>dlxlab Design Goals</h2></div></div><p>The students taking the lab vary widely in computing
background and skill. The primary intent of the control labs is to
investigate the application of control theory to actual motors,
carts, inverted pendula and so on, without having software
operation dominate the experience. On the other hand, understanding
low-level interfacing code is also a desirable outcome, so the
hardware interface has to be &ldquo;visible&rdquo;.</p><p>In order to design a control algorithm for a physical system,
one must have a mathematical model of the system to be controlled
in the form of either differential or difference equations, and
knowledge of the physical parameters in the model. The user
interface to dlxlab was designed so that, as far as possible, this
is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> information that must be supplied
by the user.</p><p>This goal is attained for the case of the program running in
simulation mode. For the situation where actual hardware is being
controlled, information describing the hardware interface must also
be provided, although it can be largely hidden from the user
through header files.</p><p>The user input to the program takes place through interactive
construction of a system file which describes the system under
investigation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x229f978"></a>System Files</h2></div></div><p>To simulate a system, one invokes dlxsim with a system
description file as argument.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dlxsim sim.sys &amp;
</pre><p>One of the lab experiments consists of a pair of
track-mounted carts, coupled by springs and driven by a servomotor.
A simple system file for simulating such a pair of spring-coupled
carts is shown in <a href="2228l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. The
format of the system file is a sequence of <b  >begin</b>
... <b  >end</b> delimited blocks. The blocks are of two
types:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Definition blocks establishing identifiers for
variables (including parameters)</p></li><li><p>Code blocks containing C code sequences which are
executed by the program to initialize variables, as well as
numerically integrate the governing differential equations to
simulate the system</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x229fdf0"></a>Executing A Simulation</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2228f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Main Program Panel and Other Windows
</p></div></div><p>The main program panel (see Figure 1) contains a &ldquo;Build&rdquo;
button, which when pressed causes processing of the system file.
That is, the user system file is converted into a series of C code
files by a parsing process. The files are compiled to a shared
object file by <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span>, and the
contents of the resulting shared object module are dynamically
linked into dlxsim as it runs. The linked code contains not just
the system differential equations, but also modules for
interactively manipulating parameters and plotting results on the
basis of the variable names provided in the system file.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2228f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Run Manager
</p></div></div><p>Assuming that the system file contains no syntactic errors,
the program log window contains only progress messages, and a
pop-up panel for controlling simulations appears (Figure 2). As
long as only parameter changes are made, a series of simulation
runs can be made. Plotting and printing is handled by
<span   class="bold"><b>gnuplot</b></span> running as a child
process.</p><p>If the system file contains errors, the error location is
reported in the log window, and the pop-up does not appear. The
errors are caught either at the parsing level or within the C code
segments. In the latter case, the error messages from gcc refer to
lines in the user system file, since the generated C files include
<b  >#line</b> statements referring to the user system
file. Since the dlxsim system file edit window is an XView
<span   class="bold"><b>textsw</b></span>, it inherits the line
searching menus associated with XView applications.</p><p>Simulations can be run and plotted, as long as the system
file contents (such as variable names, equations of motion and so
on) are not changed. If such changes are made, the &ldquo;ReBuild&rdquo;
button must be invoked to cause freeing of resources, recompilation
of the dynamic module and relinking of the generated codes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x22a04d0"></a>Controlling Actual Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The system file for an actual experiment contains code
sections which mediate between floating-point program variables and
the binary hardware levels, in addition to the requirements of a
simulation file. A file for measuring the response of a servomotor
to a constant voltage input is shown in
<a href="2228l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. This file illustrates
the use of so-called utility code and definition sections in the
system file. There is really no restriction on the type of code
placed here. The program user guide contains an example of such
code written to carry out a recursive least squares identification
algorithm using measured data resident in files. The example in
Listing 2 is much more modest and uses library include files to
abstract the interface board data access.</p><p>The include files serve to hide the actual hardware interface
behind port access macros like <b  >set_dac()</b> for
setting digital-to-analog converter levels and
<b  >get_encoder()</b> for reading the count of the
optical quadrature position encoder from the interface boards. The
code blocks using these macros are converted to dynamically linked
subroutines and repeatedly called by the program
<b  >main</b> real-time control loop.</p><p>This example is really &ldquo;open loop control&rdquo; and primarily
illustrates the hardware interface provided by the program.
Feedback controllers typically employ filtering of the measured
data, and the system file for such a controller includes a system
code section which implements the dynamics of the filters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x22a07e8"></a>I Thought Real-time Linux Wasn't
Running?</h2></div></div><p>True, certainly we would be in trouble trying to run a print
server and a copy of the Apache WWW daemon at the same time that we
were balancing an inverted double pendulum. However, in the lab
environment, the window manager (preferably Open Look olvwm) and
the control environment dlxrun are the only user level applications
running. The program dlxlab is an XView application, written in the
explicit dispatch mode. This means the timing of the control loop
is under control of the programmed loop and not the XView
notifier.</p><p>As long as the lab machines are provided with enough memory
to avoid swapping during the experiments, the effect of timing
jitter has a smaller effect than, for example, pretending that the
behavior of servomotors is entirely linear. It was originally
thought that selectively killing and restarting certain daemon
processes would be necessary, but our experience has shown that
this is not the case. In any event, one of the aims of control
design is to produce controllers which are robust against
unmodelled disturbances, and timing jitter provides an example of
such a disturbance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x22a0948"></a>Equipment Description</h2></div></div><p>We run lab experiments on machines ranging from a 12MB
486SLC-66 to a Pentium P5-166. There is no problem running the
experiments on our set of 486DX2-66 boxes, with sample rates up to
several thousand samples per second. The lab machines are on a
local network with 10Base-2 coaxial cable, with a salvaged 386DX-16
staggering along as the resident print server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x22a0a50"></a>Further Information</h2></div></div><p>The Linux machine in my office is running the Apache web
server and has a WWW page for our control and robotics lab. The
address is http://jhd486.mast.queensu.ca/. The lab page has photos
of the lab equipment and links to my home page where documentation,
sources and binaries for the dlxlab programs are available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21a7580.0x22a0b58"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The dlxlab environment described began life as an
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> script that turned a system
file (ancestor of the ones above) into an XView control system
simulation program, running under SunOS-4.1. After a Linux
conversion experience, I came upon a version of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel Hacker's Guide</em></span> by Michael Johnson and
discovered that user level I/O port access was possible under
Linux. This allowed the program to accomplish hardware control as
well as simulation tasks.</p><p>The low cost and wide availability of interface boards for
PC-compatible machines make them ideal for a lab such as the one we
have set up. The complete openness of the Linux system made it
possible to undertake program development with the confidence that
it could be made to work. It is also helpful to have the same
operating environment in the office, at home and in the robotics
and control lab.</p><p>Virtual beers all around.</p></div></div>
