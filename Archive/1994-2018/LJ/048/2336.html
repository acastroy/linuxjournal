    This month we are presented with an introduction to the
    networking of distributed objects and the use of CORBA.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2aa6a80"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the last few articles in this series,
we dealt with basic low-level network programming in Linux, and
with the issues involved in developing network servers (daemons).
However, coding at this low level is extremely tedious and prone to
error as a result.
</p><p>Nevertheless, distributing an application over the network
provides significant benefits over a monolithic, stand-alone
structure&mdash;and these benefits make the additional development
investment (in terms of time and money) worthwhile.</p><p>In this article, we will introduce an approach intended to
reduce the added complexity in writing a network application by
applying object-oriented techniques to the development and
coding&mdash;namely, the use of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Common Object Request
Broker Architecture</em></span> (CORBA).</p><p>In the next article, we will present different software
packages, available for Linux, which implement the CORBA standards.
In addition, a basic introduction to developing applications with
CORBA will be given.</p><p>Note that this article assumes a basic familiarity with C,
C++, object-oriented development, the BSD socket API and RPCs. It
presents the key concepts of CORBA which need to be understood
before developing applications. These concepts, and the associated
terminology, comprise much of the learning curve of CORBA. This
article is necessarily theoretical in order to develop a vocabulary
to be used when developing with CORBA.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2aa6d40"></a>The Benefits of Distributed Computing</h2></div></div><p>The motivations for structuring a system as a set of
distributed components include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>An increased ability to collaborate through better
connectivity and networking</p></li><li><p>The potential to increase performance and
efficiency through the use of parallel processing</p></li><li><p>Increased reliability, scalability and availability
through replication</p></li><li><p>A greater cost-effectiveness through the sharing of
computing resources (for example, printers, disk and processing
power) and the implementation of heterogeneous, open systems</p></li></ul></div><p>Along with these impressive advantages comes additional
complexity to the development process. The programmer now has to
handle situations like the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Network delay and latency</p></li><li><p>Load balancing between the different processing
elements in the system</p></li><li><p>Ensuring the correct ordering of events</p></li><li><p>Partial failure of communications links, in
particular with regard to immutable transactions (i.e.,
transactions which must yield the same result if repeated&mdash;for
example, the accidental processing of a bank transaction twice
should not erroneously affect the account balance)</p></li></ul></div><p>One of the earlier techniques in reducing the programmer's
work (to develop these distributed applications) was the remote
procedure call (RPC).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2aa7528"></a>Remote Procedure Calls</h2></div></div><p>RPCs have already been introduced in <i  >Linux Journal</i> in an excellent article by Ed Petron, &ldquo;Portable
Database Management with /rdb&rdquo;, October 1997. The motivation
behind RPCs is to make network programming as easy as making a
traditional function call. Linux provides the Open Network
Computing flavor of remote procedure calls (ONC-RPC), which was
originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, CA) for
use in its Network File System (NFS) implementation.</p><p>RPCs do nothing more than hide the implementation details of
creating sockets (network endpoints), sending data and closing the
sockets as required. They are also responsible for converting the
(remote) procedure's (local data) parameters into a format suitable
for network transportation and again into a format that can be used
on the remote host. This network-transparent transmission of data
ensures both end machines can interpret the information content
correctly.</p><p>Quite often, different representation issues are involved in
this process (for example, byte ordering, ASCII to EBCDIC, etc.).
Additionally, pointers (references to address locations in a
virtual memory space) cannot be passed directly from one
process/machine to another. Instead, a &ldquo;deep copy&rdquo; needs to be
performed, copying the data pointed to by the pointer which is then
sent &ldquo;across the wire&rdquo;. The entire procedure of transferring the
data from the native format of a machine into a network-transparent
format is called &ldquo;marshalling&rdquo;. The reverse procedure is called
&ldquo;de-marshaling&rdquo;. The ONC-RPC uses a special type of marshaling
called external data representation (XDR). Figure 1 shows the
sequence of events involved in a remote procedure call. The
mechanisms and semantics of ONC-RPCs are discussed in much greater
detail in RFC 1831, RFC 1832 and RFC 1833.</p><p><a href="2336f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2aa7840"></a>An Object-Oriented Approach</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned, RPCs follow the traditional functional model.
State information may need to be maintained independently at both
client and server (depending on the type of application). This data
is often repeatedly re-transferred across the network on each
remote function call.</p><p>An alternative architecture is to use techniques from
object-oriented development and to partition the system into a set
of independent objects. Each object is responsible for maintaining
its own internal state information.</p><p>By using an object-oriented approach to your network software
development, you can promote certain beneficial traits in your
code:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Encapsulation: ensuring a clear separation between
the interfaces (through which the objects in your system interact
with one another) and their implementations</p></li><li><p>Modularity, scalability and extensibility</p></li><li><p>Re-usability (of code and, perhaps more
importantly, of design)</p></li><li><p>Inheritance and specialization of functionality and
polymorphism</p></li></ul></div><p>The act of sending a message from one entity on a network to
another is remarkably similar to one object invoking a method on
another object. The integration of distributed network technology
and object-orientation unites the features of a basic
communications infrastructure with a high-level abstraction of
these interfaces and a framework for encapsulation and
modularity&mdash;through this, developing applications which inter-work
is significantly more intuitive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2a9e5f8"></a>The Object Management Architecture</h2></div></div><p>In 1991, a group of interested parties joined to form the
Object Management Group (OMG)--a consortium dedicated to the
standardization of distributed object computing. The OMG supports
heterogeneity in its architectures, providing the mechanisms for
applications written in any language (running on any operating
system, any hardware platform) to communicate and collaborate with
each other&mdash;in essence, the development of a &ldquo;software bus&rdquo; to
allow for implementation diversity, as a hardware bus does for
expansion cards.</p><p>The OMG architecture which permits this distributed
collaboration of objects is called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Object Management
Architecture</em></span> (OMA). Figure 2 shows the object management
architecture.</p><p><a href="2336f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Object Management Architecture (OMA)</b></span></a></p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>CORBAservices</em></span> provide the basic
functionality for the management of objects during their
lifetime&mdash;for example, this includes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Naming (uniquely specifying a particular object
instance)</p></li><li><p>Security (providing auditing, authentication,
etc.)</p></li><li><p>Persistence (allowing object instances to be
&ldquo;flattened&rdquo; to or created from a sequence of bytes)</p></li><li><p>Trading (providing objects and ORBs a mechanism to
&ldquo;advertise&rdquo; particular functionality)</p></li><li><p>Events (allows an object to dynamically register or
unregister an interest in a particular type of event, essentially
decoupling the communication from the object)</p></li><li><p>Life-cycle (allows objects to be created, copied,
moved, deleted)</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Common Facilities</em></span> provide the frameworks
necessary for application development using distributed objects.
These frameworks are classified into two distinct groups:
horizontal facilities (commonly used in all applications, such as
user-interface management, information management, task management
and system management), and vertical facilities (related more to a
particular industry, for example telecommunications or health
care).</p><p>The CORBA standard specifies an entity called the Object
Request Broker (ORB), which is the &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that binds objects
together to enable higher-level distributed collaboration. It
enables the exchange of CORBA requests between local and remote
objects. Figure 3 shows the architecture of CORBA. Figure 4 shows
the invocation of methods on different remote objects via the
ORB.</p><p><a href="2336f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Common Object Request Broker Architecture
(CORBA)</b></span></a></p><p><a href="2336f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4.
Calling a method within a specific object
instance</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2a9f0f8"></a>More about CORBA</h2></div></div><p>In the OMA, objects provide services. Clients issue requests
to different objects for these services to be performed on their
(the client) behalf. The repetitive transmission of state
information that is common with RPC applications is avoided since
each object is responsible for maintaining its own state. In
addition, the objects interact through well-defined interfaces and
are unaware of each others' implementation details. As such, it is
much easier to replace or upgrade an object implementation, as long
as the interface is maintained. The objects in an OMA/CORBA system
may take on many different roles in relation to one another:
peer-to-peer, client/server or publish/subscribe, etc.</p><p>Before an object can issue a request to invoke a method on an
object, it must have a valid reference for that object. The ORB
uses this reference to identify and locate the object&mdash;thus
providing location transparency. As an application writer, you need
not be concerned with how your application finds an object, the ORB
performs this function for you transparently. In a similar fashion
to how RPCs use XDR, CORBA specifies the <span   class="emphasis"><em>common data
representation</em></span> (CDR) format to transfer data across the
network.</p><p>An object reference does not describe the interface of an
object. Before an application can make use of an object
(reference), it must somehow determine/know what services an object
provides.</p><p>Interfaces to objects are defined via the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Interface
Description Language</em></span> (IDL). The OMG IDL defines the
interface of an object by means of the various methods they support
and the parameters these methods accept. Various language mappings
exist for the IDL (for example, C, C++, Java, COBOL, etc.). The
generated language stubs provide the application with compile-time
knowledge which allows these interfaces to be accessed.</p><p>The interfaces, alternatively, can be added to a special
database, called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>interface repository</em></span>. The
interface repository contains a dynamic copy of the interface
information of an object, which is generated statically via the
IDL. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Invocation Interface</em></span> (DII) is
the facility by which an object client can probe an object for the
methods it supports and, upon discovering a particular method, can
invoke it at runtime. This involves looking up the object
interface, generating the method parameters, invoking the method on
the remote object and returning the results.</p><p>On the &ldquo;server&rdquo; side, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Skeleton
Interface</em></span> (DSI) allows the ORB to invoke object
implementations that do not have static (i.e., compile time)
knowledge of the type of object it is implementing. All requests to
a particular object are handled by having the ORB invoke the same
single call-up routine, called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dynamic Interface
Routine</em></span> (DIR). The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Implementation
Repository</em></span> (as opposed to Interface Repository) is a
runtime database of information about the classes the ORB knows of,
its instantiated objects and additional implementation information
(logging, security auditing, etc.).</p><p>The Object Adapter sits above the core ORB network
functionality. It acts as a mediator between the ORB and the
object, accepting method requests on the object's behalf. It helps
alleviate &ldquo;bloated&rdquo; objects or ORBs.</p><p>The Object Adapter enables the instantiation of new objects,
requests passing between the ORB and an object, the assignment of
object references to an object (uniquely naming the object), and
the registering of classes of objects with the Implementation
Repository.</p><p>Currently, all ORB implementations must support one object
adapter, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Basic Object Adapter</em></span>
(BOA).</p><p>All of this talk about interoperability is not useful unless
ORBs from different developers/vendors can communicate with one
another. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>General InterORB Protocol</em></span> (GIOP)
is a bridge specifying a standard transfer syntax and a set of
message formats for the networking of ORBs. The GIOP is independent
of any network transport.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet InterORB Protocol</em></span> (IIOP)
specifies a mapping between GIOP and TCP/IP. That is, it details
how GIOP information is exchanged using TCP/IP connections. In this
way, it enables &ldquo;out-of-the-box&rdquo; interoperability with
IIOP-compatible ORBs based on the world's most popular product and
vendor neutral network transport&mdash;TCP/IP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2a9f8e0"></a>Multi-tier Network Computing</h2></div></div><p>CORBA is an example of what is termed &ldquo;middleware&rdquo;--a
technology that enables the separation of applications into three
distinct sections (see Figure 5):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The presentation, or user interface, tier</p></li><li><p>The business logic, or control, tier</p></li><li><p>The data storage tier</p></li></ol></div><p><a href="2336f5.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 5.
Three-Tier Network Computing</b></span></a></p><p>The presentation layer could be an HTML form or a Java applet
(as in Figure 5). Extracting the control logic from the
presentation allows you to network-enable the presentation of your
application.</p><p>It also allows the end user to use less expensive hardware to
interact with the application, since their equipment is now
responsible only for rendering the information supplied to it by
the control logic. In addition, the presentation system does not
need to have any knowledge of where the data originally came from
or in what format it is stored in the database&mdash;all it needs is the
interface to the middle layer.</p><p>The control logic can perform access management, alter the
view of the information as required to enable different users to
view different subsets of the same data&mdash;perhaps for security
reasons. For example, a doctor in a hospital may want to see the
patient's medical history, whereas someone from the finance
department should only be able to see billing information. In
Figure 5, either Java or CORBA performs the role of the business
logic.</p><p>By separating the control logic from the data store, you gain
the benefits of distributed computing. Your logic can encapsulate
database access, providing you with scalability and fault-tolerance
for mission-critical data. All sources of corporate information can
be integrated via the control logic to achieve what is termed a
&ldquo;data warehouse&rdquo;--allowing all the information to be accessed via
a single interface (depending, of course, on security
clearance).</p><p>Legacy systems can be encapsulated, thereby protecting your
existing investments. By standardizing the interface between the
business logic and the data, you can more easily replace or upgrade
database systems. The desktop machines (responsible for
presentation) do not need to be modified. The task of replacing a
database becomes solely concerned with that action&mdash;moving data
from one database to another, without affecting the other
components of the system.</p><p>The control logic can also augment the capabilities of the
data storage system, performing additional features, such as
searching the information for non-obvious trends (a process called
&ldquo;data-mining&rdquo;).</p><p>The separation of application systems into a number of
distinct tiers, and standardizing the interfaces between these
tiers, ensures that when you make a modification to one layer, the
effect of this change on your entire architecture is
localized.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29ae580.0x2a9ffc0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>In this article, we introduced the Common Object Request
