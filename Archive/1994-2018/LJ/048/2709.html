    This month Mr. Lerner shows us how to set up a web site
    using many of the techniques he's taught us over the past
    months.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd4a580.0xe42450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last year, we have looked at
ways to create sophisticated web sites using little more than CGI
programs written in Perl. Among other things, we have explored
HTML/Perl templates (for separating design from programs), HTTP
cookies (to identify returning users) and relational databases (to
store information in a readily retrievable format while gaining
robustness and security).
</p><p>This month, we will see how we can use all of these
techniques together. Such a combination of techniques is used on
many commercial sites and is the basic idea behind several web
server projects, including Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASPs),
Vignette's StoryServer, AOL's freely distributed AOLServer and the
freely distributable PHP/FI.</p><p>Note that many of the examples in this month's installment
refer to techniques and ideas that were discussed in previous
issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. If you are new to the
magazine or to the ideas, please see the &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; sidebar,
which should give you some good starting points for learning about
these subjects.</p><p>Our example site will revolve around a single table tracking
users' birthdays. Once we have created the table for the birthdays,
we will write a CGI program that allows users to enter their
birthdays into the table. Finally, we will combine the use of
cookies and Perl/HTML templates to create personalized home pages
drawing upon the information stored in the database.</p><p>Assuming that MySQL is our relational database server and
that our table will be in the &ldquo;test&rdquo; database, at the prompt type
the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql test
</pre><p>This starts the MySQL client, allowing us to enter SQL
queries interactively. The &ldquo;test&rdquo; database used in these examples
comes with MySQL and is completely insecure&mdash;it cuts down on the
space required to explain how to secure new databases created with
MySQL. As a result, you should seriously consider creating separate
databases and users for each of your web applications, so as to
reduce the risk of unauthorized users modifying or viewing data on
your system.
</p><p>First, we must create a table with information about our
users and their birthdays. Here are some simple SQL commands that
create such a table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; create table birthdays (person_id int unsigned
auto_increment,
        -&gt;   firstname varchar(15) not null,
        -&gt;   lastname varchar(15) not null,
        -&gt;   email varchar(50) not null primary key,
        -&gt;   birthdate date not null,
        -&gt;   key id (person_id));
</pre><p>This creates the &ldquo;birthdays&rdquo; table in the &ldquo;test&rdquo;
database. The table has five columns (person_id, firstname,
lastname, email and birthdate), none of which may be blank. Each
row in the table represents a distinct user whose birth date we
wish to track; we ensure that no user is entered twice by setting
the &ldquo;email&rdquo; column to be a primary key, which is a fancy way of
saying that no value of &ldquo;email&rdquo; may be repeated. Since users may
have multiple e-mail addresses, we cannot ensure that a user will
not enter his or her birthday twice. However, this is likely to
reduce such repetition, and is better than using the person's name,
which is rarely unique.
</p><p>The first column, person_id, will be set automatically by
MySQL each time we add a user to the database. The first entry in
the system will have person_id set to 1, the second entry will have
it set to 2 and so forth. Because person_id is of type <b  >int
unsigned</b>, our system can accept no more than
4,294,967,295 unique entries&mdash;smaller than your particular database
might need, but large enough for most of my purposes.</p><p>We can get a good picture of our database using the
&ldquo;describe&rdquo; command at the &ldquo;mysql&rdquo; prompt, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; describe birthdays;
Field       Type    Null        Key     Default Extra
person_id   int(10) unsigned    MUL     0       auto-increment
firstname   varchar(15)
lastname    varchar(15)
email       varchar(50)         PRI
birthdate   date                        0000-00-00
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd4a580.0xe42a28"></a>Entering data into the table</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have created the infrastructure, we need
applications that will allow people to enter their birthdays. The
easiest way to do this is to create an HTML form whose contents are
submitted to a CGI program that takes information from the form and
saves it to the database. One such form is shown in
<a href="2709l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>The form is relatively straightforward, although it might
seem a bit daunting because of the long selection lists defined
using the &ldquo;select&rdquo; and &ldquo;option&rdquo; tags. Using such lists, rather
than allowing the user to enter a birthday into a text field,
reduces the number of errors that a user might enter. It is
certainly possible, though, that someone could create an HTML form
with identical field names, using text fields instead of selection
lists, and thus circumvent our system. The moral, then, is that you
should always try to reduce the number of errors that users might
enter, but always check to be certain that data were entered
correctly.</p><p>As you can see from looking at Listing 1, our form gathers
six pieces of information: first name, last name, e-mail address
and user's birth month, day and year. The latter three pieces of
information are separated so that we can simplify the user
interface; as we will soon see, combining these to create an valid
MySQL &ldquo;date&rdquo; type is fairly simple.</p><p>Our form's &ldquo;form&rdquo; tag indicates that data should be
submitted using the POST method to a CGI program named
&ldquo;enter-birthday-info.pl&rdquo;.</p><p>We take the user's input and create a SQL query that creates
a new entry in the table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Now that we have the basic information, create
# an SQL query
my $command = "insert into birthdays ";
$command .= "(firstname, lastname, email, birthdate) ";
$command .= "values ";
$command .= "(\"$firstname\", \"$lastname\",
\"$email\", \"$birthdate\")";
</pre><p>Of course, you do not need to store the command in the
variable <b  >$command</b>. Indeed, you can create the
command directly when using <b  >$dbh-&gt;query</b>,
rather than putting it together and then passing
<b  >$command</b> as an argument to
<b  >$dbh-&gt;query</b>. Putting the query together in
this fashion makes it easier to read when programming and easier to
send the SQL query to the screen if bugs appear.
</p><p>After we send our query to the database server, the row is
probably added. However, we do not want to just assume it was added
because something serious might have happened, and we wish to give
a correct indication of the outcome to the user.</p><p>First, we check to see if
<b  >$dbh-&gt;errno</b>--the value of an error returned
by MySQL&mdash;was set to 2000. This is the specific error code returned
when trying to insert a row that conflicts with another row. Since
we have defined &ldquo;email&rdquo; to be a primary key, the odds are rather
high that if errno is set to 2000, then we have tried to enter a
duplicate e-mail address:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if ($dbh-&gt;errno == 2000)
   {
        &amp;log_and_die(
"There is already an entry in\ the database for \"
$email\". Try another\ e-mail address!");
   }
</pre><p>If this was not the case, then we should check for any other
error. The easiest way to detect errors is to see if
<b  >$sth</b> is undefined; if it has not been given any
value, then an error occurred, which we identify for the user and
in the error log. Note that our general error-catching mechanism
needs to come after the mechanism for catching error 2000.
<pre     class="programlisting">
elseif (!defined $sth)
   {
     &amp;log_and_die("MySQL error " . $dbh-&gt;errno .
"\ on command \"$command\"&lt;P&gt;" . $dbh-&gt;errmsg)
 unless (defined $sth);
   }
</pre>


Finally, if no errors occurred, then we can print a message
indicating success:
<pre     class="programlisting">
else
   {
        # Return something to the user
        print "&lt;P&gt;Done!&lt;/P&gt;\n";
   }
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd4a580.0xe431b8"></a>Tracking Users</h2></div></div><p>Now users can enter information about their birthdays into
the system. But wait&mdash;at the beginning of the column, I said that
we were going to make it possible to keep track of users' comings
and goings. One easy way to do that is to use HTTP cookies, small
pieces of data stored on the user's computer that are sent to the
site that set them. CGI programs can set cookies whenever they
return an HTTP response to a user's browser. Whatever cookies were
set are then returned upon each subsequent visit to that web
server. In this way, they can be used as variables, albeit
variables that might be modified or removed by users worried about
their privacy, or who might come to our site from a friend's
computer.</p><p>Our cookie will have to be a unique identifier that can be
used to bring up the user's entry from the &ldquo;birthdays&rdquo; table. We
thus have two options&mdash;the user's e-mail address, which is
guaranteed to be unique because it is a primary key, and person_id,
which is automatically incremented each time a new entry is added
to the table. We will use person_id, but there is no reason why you
could not use the &ldquo;email&rdquo; column. Indeed, given that &ldquo;email&rdquo; is
a primary key, you could even do away with the person_id
column&mdash;except that if you were to create other tables that refer
to individual users, keeping track of an integer (such as
person_id) is much more efficient than using their full e-mail
address.</p><p>How can we retrieve the ID that was added to a row that we
might add? The most obvious way is to retrieve the row that we just
entered, creating and sending an SQL query to the MySQL server. But
MySQL has an easier way to do this&mdash;after sending our query, we can
ask for <b  >$sth-&gt;insertid</b>.
<b  >$sth</b> is the &ldquo;statement handle,&rdquo; an object that
allows us to send and retrieve information about an individual SQL
query and statement, and <span   class="bold"><b>insertid</b></span>
is one of the methods that <b  >$sth</b> provides.</p><p>Once we know the value of person_id, we can create a cookie
with the following two lines of Perl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $cookie = $query-&gt;cookie(-name =&gt; "person_id",
        -value =&gt; $sth-&gt;insertid);
</pre><p>The cookie (now stored in <b  >$cookie</b>) is sent
as part of the HTTP header returned by the CGI program to the
user's browser. Thus, the original version (see
<a href="2709l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>) of our program sent a
basic MIME header at the beginning of the program's execution with
the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
print $query-&gt;header("text/html");
</pre>


But the new version of our program will have to move that to a
later portion of the program, after we have already sent our query
to the database. In addition, we will have to modify our statement
such that it sends the cookie along with the MIME information in
the header. This can be accomplished with the following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
print $query-&gt;header(-type =&gt; "text/html",
                         -cookie =&gt; $cookie);
</pre>


When the above code runs, it sends both the MIME header that
describes the type of output that we are sending to the client, and
the information describing the &ldquo;person_id&rdquo; cookie that we want to
set. Every time this user visits our site in the future, we will be
able to retrieve the value of &ldquo;person_id&rdquo;, and thus look the user
up in a table in our database.
</p><p>You can see the results of changing our program in
<a href="2709l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. The modifications are
fairly small, but they ensure that a cookie is returned to the
user's browser whenever we successfully add a row to the database.
(When no row is added to the database, the header remains as
before, sending the MIME header but nothing else.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd4a580.0xe437e8"></a>Retrieving the Data</h2></div></div><p>The final part of our system will bring cookies and databases
together with another technique we discussed several months ago,
Perl/HTML templates. Templates are pages of HTML with small
snippets of Perl interspersed between the HTML tags, accessed via a
short program that uses the Text::Template module to turn the Perl
into text. This allows HTML pages to perform database lookups,
calculations and other elements that require computation too
difficult to accomplish with server-side includes. Unlike straight
CGI programs, templates can be edited by your site's designers and
HTML coders, removing the programmer as a bottleneck to changing
the HTML that a program produces.</p><p>In <a href="2709l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>, you can see
wrapper.pl, a CGI program that turns templates into HTML. (A
version of wrapper.pl published in a previous issue of
<i  >LJ</i> was not tested thoroughly, and contains
several bugs that were fixed in this version.) Assuming that
wrapper.pl is installed on your system and that the file
/home/httpd/html/birthdayhp.tmpl is a valid template, you should be
able to request</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/cgi-bin/wrapper.pl?/home/httpd/html/birthdayhp.tmpl
</pre><p>In other words, wrapper.pl should be invoked with a single
argument, the name of the template that should be evaluated and
then returned.
</p><p>This version of wrapper.pl allows us to pass variables to the
template using the <i  >LJ</i> package (as described in the manual pages for
Text::Template). This allows us to pass variable values from
wrapper.pl to templates. In general, we would not want to pass
variable values from wrapper.pl to a template, since the template
should be somewhat isolated from its surroundings and should be
allowed to assign its own variables. But in this case, we do want
to pass one value, that of $query (the CGI instance), which allows
us to access information passed to wrapper.pl per the CGI
specification. This includes the &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; method, which allows us
to retrieve cookies that our server has set in the past.</p><p>I have included a simple version of birthdayhp.tmpl in
<a href="2709l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>, so that you can see how
easy it is to include Perl inside HTML. There is a performance
penalty for serving documents in this way, since you are forcing an
invocation of Perl each time a template is viewed on your system.
But that drawback is often counterbalanced by a template's
versatility and ease of inclusion in a site. A large Web site's
editorial and production staffs can thus modify the site's content
and design without disturbing programs necessary for the site to
run. The programs are surrounded by curly braces, making them easy
to spot in an HTML file.</p><p>One thing to remember when dealing with templates is that the
output from each Perl fragment is inserted into the resulting HTML.
If you wish to send the text &ldquo;Hello, there&rdquo; to the user's browser
from within a Perl fragment, in order for things to work correctly
you must use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
    "Hello, there"
  }
</pre><p>or a slightly more formal version:
<pre     class="programlisting">
{
    my $outputstring = "";
    $outputstring .= "Hello, there";
    $outputstring;
  }
</pre>


Do not make the mistake of trying to use
<span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> from within a template, as
in this case:
<pre     class="programlisting">
{
    my $outputstring = "";
    $outputstring .= "Hello, there";
    print $outputstring;
  }
</pre>


The contents of $outputstring will indeed be sent to the user's
browser thanks to print, but the text will be sent ahead of the
rest of the template. In place of the Perl block containing this
code, the Text::Template module will insert the result from
print&mdash;the result will have a value of 1 when printing is
successful. Setting strings, rather than printing them directly, is
the norm in the case of templates, but takes some getting used to
if you are an experienced Perl programmer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd4a580.0xe3a6a8"></a>Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>The trick now is to create a template that does the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Grabs the value of person_id from any cookie that
the user's browser might send.</p></li><li><p>Uses the value of person_id to retrieve information
about the user from the database.</p></li><li><p>Uses the information from the database to create a
personalized HTML page greeting the user.</p></li></ul></div><p>Getting the value of the user's cookie is almost as simple as
setting it. Just as our CGI program can set one or more cookies
when it returns an HTTP header to the user's browser, the value of
the cookie is sent to our server in the HTTP headers accompanying
any request we might receive. Once our person_id cookie is set on
the user's computer, every visit to our site will be prefaced with
the name and value of person_id. We can retrieve the values of all
cookies on our system with a call to the &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; method, just as
we used it to create our cookie.</p><p><a href="2709l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a> contains a very
short CGI program (show-cookies.pl) that prints the names and
values of all cookies sent to a particular server. Remember that
cookies are only sent to the server that originally set them&mdash;so
while your browser might contain a large number of cookie
name-value pairs, the output from show-cookies.pl will only display
those created by your server.</p><p>In show-cookies.pl, we iterate through each of the cookies
sent to the web server. But for our particular purposes, we are
only interested in a single cookie, &ldquo;person_id&rdquo;. We can retrieve
that by using the &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; method in the following way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $person_id = $query-&gt;cookie("person_id");
</pre><p>Assuming that a cookie named &ldquo;person_id&rdquo; was sent to the
web server (meaning that the &ldquo;person_id&rdquo; cookie had been set by a
program on that server in the past), its value would now be
available in the variable $person_id. We can then use $person_id as
a unique key in our &ldquo;birthdays&rdquo; table, allowing us to retrieve
information about returning users.
</p><p>Among other things, we must ensure that the template handles
the possibility that a user with a cookie might not appear in the
database, or that a user might go to the customized home page
without a cookie. In the test template (cookie.tmpl), this is
handled in a fairly crude way, printing out both the value of the
user's &ldquo;person_id&rdquo; cookie and the number of rows matching this
value of person_id in the database. In the example template shown
in <a href="2709l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a>, we include the
following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (($person_id == 0) || ($sth-&gt;numrows == 0))
  {
    $outputstring .=
        "&lt;P&gt;Error retrieving information.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    $outputstring .= "&lt;P&gt;person_id (cookie) = \"
        $person_id\".&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    my $numrows = $sth-&gt;numrows;
    $outputstring .=
      "&lt;P&gt;Rows returned from table = \"
      $numrows\"&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    $outputstring .=
        "&lt;P&gt;&lt;a href=\"/birthday.html\"&gt;";
    $outputstring .=
        "Enter your birthday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n";
  }
</pre><p>This code checks to see if <b  >$person_id</b>
(which is sent as a cookie from the user's browser and should
correspond to a single row in the &ldquo;birthdays&rdquo; table) is equal to
0, which can also mean that it is not set. If
<b  >$person_id</b> is 0, then we have no cookie on
record for this user. This does not necessarily mean that the user
has never visited our site before&mdash;some users reject cookies
because of privacy concerns, others use multiple browsers (each of
which keeps its own list of cookies) and still others might be
accessing the web from multiple computers. But our system does
ensure that users accessing our site from the same computer (and
the same browser) will see their birthday displayed whenever they
come to our system.
</p><p>We also compare <b  >$sth-&gt;numrows</b> with 0 to
see if no rows were returned from the database. It is quite
possible that a user might have visited our site long ago, and that
the cookie from that visit remained on that user's computer&mdash;but
that all early visitors' entries in the database were somehow
deleted. Under such circumstances,
<b  >$sth-&gt;numrows</b> will return 0 (meaning that no
rows had a person_id column matching <b  >$person_id</b>
from the user's cookie), and we have to request a new birthday
entry from the user.</p><p>If the query did return a row (and we know that it will
return one row at the most, since person_id must be unique), then
we have to grab that row with <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b>,
and then read the values of the resulting array into our variables.
In this particular case, we do nothing more than print them
out:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
{
        while (my @arr = $sth-&gt;fetchrow)
        {
          my ($firstname, $lastname, $email,
                $birthdate) = @arr;
        $outputstring .=
                "&lt;P&gt;firstname =
\"$firstname\"&lt;/P&gt;\n";
        $outputstring .=
                "&lt;P&gt;lastname =
\"$lastname&lt;"&lt;/P&gt;\n";
        $outputstring .=
                "&lt;P&gt;email = \"$email\"&lt;/P&gt;\n";
        $outputstring .=
                "&lt;P&gt;birthdate =
\"$birthdate\"&lt;/P&gt;\n";
        }
}
</pre><p>Of course, if we were interested in doing something a little
more interesting, we could do so by taking the values returned by
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow</b> and using the resulting
variables in the title of the HTML page or a comparison of today
with the user's birth date. The point is that the database is a
means for storing information between invocations of the CGI
program. Once the information has been read into the CGI program
from the database, we can use that information just as easily as if
we had assigned the variables at the beginning of its invocation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd4a580.0xe3b150"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Most people do not need to be reminded of their birthdays.
And indeed, the use of birthdays in this example was simply for
demonstration purposes. Even with the limited information we stored
in our database, we can create a bare-bones personalized home page
that displays the user's name in the title. With a little more
work, we could print a special message on this user's birthday, or
an indication of how many days remain until the user's next
birthday.</p><p>And because we have stored all users' birthdays in our
database, we can create applications that access other birthdays on
the system. For instance, we could create a CGI program (or a
Perl/HTML template) that finds other users on the system with your
birthday. The possibilities are endless, and putting the
information into templates means that you (as the programmer or
webmaster) can concentrate on writing the code necessary to make
things run, while the site's editorial and production staffs can
make things look pretty and ensure that they are grammatically
correct as well.</p><p>With that, we end our whirlwind (albeit longer than usual)
tour of integrating multiple techniques into a single web site. Web
sites based on databases are increasingly popular, for good reason.
The largest and best-known web sites combine back-end databases
with templates and cookies to give each user a personalized
experience; now that you have seen how it can be done, create some
