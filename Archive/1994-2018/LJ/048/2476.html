    The main goal of this article is to learn what a driver is, how
    to implement a driver for Linux and how to integrate it into the
    operating system&mdash;an article for the experienced C programmer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x15f92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The concept of an operating system (OS)
must be well understood before any attempt to navigate inside it is
made. Several definitions are available for an OS:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>An OS is the set of manual and automatic procedures
which allow a set of users to share a computing system in an
efficient manner.</p></li><li><p>The dictionary defines an OS as a program or set of
programs which manage the processes of a computing system and allow
the normal execution of the other jobs.</p></li><li><p>The definition from the Tanenbaum book (see
Resources): An operating system is [the program] which controls all
the resources of the computer and offers the support where users
can develop application programs.</p></li></ol></div>

</p><p>It is also very important to clearly distinguish a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span> from a <span   class="emphasis"><em>process</em></span>. A
program is a block of data plus instructions, which is stored in a
file on disk and is ready to be executed. On the other hand, a
process is an image in memory of the program which is being
executed. This difference is highly important, because usually the
processes are running under OS control. Here, our program is the
OS, so we cannot speak about processes.</p><p>We will use the term <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel</em></span> to refer to
the main body of the OS, which is a program written in the C
language. The program file may be named vmlinuz, vmlinux or zImage,
and has some things in common with the MS-DOS files COMMAND.COM,
MSDOS.SYS and IO.SYS, although their functionality is different.
When we discuss <span   class="emphasis"><em>compilation</em></span> of the kernel, we
mean that we will edit the source files in order to generate a new
kernel.</p><p>Peripheral or internal <span   class="emphasis"><em>devices</em></span> allow
users to communicate with the computer. Examples of devices are:
keyboards, monitors, floppy and hard disks, CD-ROMs, printers, mice
(serial/parallel), networks, modems, etc. A
<span   class="emphasis"><em>driver</em></span> is the part of the OS that manages
communication with devices; thus, they are usually called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>device drivers</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x15f99d0"></a>What is a Driver?</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2476f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Software/Hardware Scheme
</p></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows the relation between user programs, the OS and
the devices. Differences between software and hardware are clearly
specified in this scheme. At the left side, user programs may
interact with the devices (for example, a hard disk) through a set
of high-level library functions. For example, we can open and write
to a file of the hard disk calling the C library functions
<span   class="bold"><b>fopen</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>fprintf</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FILE *fid=fopen("filename", "w");
fprintf(fid, "Hello, world!");
fclose(fid);
</pre><p>The user can also write to a file (or to another device such
as a printer) from the OS shell, using commands such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Hello, world!" &gt;
echo "Hello, world!" &gt; /dev/lp
</pre>


To execute this command, both the shell and the library functions
perform a call to a low level function of the OS, e.g.,
<span   class="bold"><b>open()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>write()</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>close()</b></span>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fid = open("/dev/lp", O_WRONLY);
write(fid, "Hello, world!");
close(fid);
</pre>


Each device can be referred to as a special file named /dev/*.
Internally, the OS is composed of a set of drivers, which are
pieces of software that perform the low-level communication with
each device. At this execute level, the kernel calls driver
functions such as <span   class="bold"><b>lp_open()</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>lp_write()</b></span>.
</p><p>On the right side of Figure 1, the hardware is composed of
the device (a video display or an Ethernet link) plus an interface
(a VGA card or a network card). Finally, the device driver is the
physical interface between the software and the hardware. The
driver reads from and writes to the hardware through ports (memory
addresses where the hardware links physically), using the internal
functions <span   class="bold"><b>out_p</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>in_p</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
out_p(0x3a, 0x1f);
data = in_p(0x3b);
</pre><p>Note that these functions are not available to the user.
Since the Linux kernel runs in protected mode, the low memory
addresses, where the ports addresses reside, are not user
accessible. Functions equivalent to the low-level functions
<span   class="bold"><b>in</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>out</b></span> do not exist in the high-level
library, as in other operating systems such as MS-DOS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x15fa318"></a>Features of a Driver</h2></div></div><p>The main features of a driver are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It performs input/output (I/O) management.</p></li><li><p>It provides transparent device management, avoiding
low-level programming (ports).</p></li><li><p>It increases I/O speed, because usually it has been
optimized.</p></li><li><p>It includes software and hardware error
management.</p></li><li><p>It allows concurrent access to the hardware by
several processes.</p></li></ul></div><p>There are four types of drivers: character drivers, block
drivers, terminal drivers and streams. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Character
drivers</em></span> transmit information from the user to the device
(or vice versa) byte per byte (see Figure 2). Two examples are the
printer, /dev/lp, and the memory (yes, the memory is also a
device), /dev/mem.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2476f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Character Drivers
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Block drivers</em></span> (see Figure 3) transmit
information block per block. This means that the incoming data
(from the user or from the device) are stored in a buffer until the
buffer is full. When this occurs, the buffer content is physically
sent to the device or to the user. This is the reason why all the
printed messages do not appear in the screen when a user program
crashes (the messages in the buffer were lost), or the floppy drive
light does not always turn on when the user writes to a file. The
clearest examples of this type of driver are disks: floppy disks
(/dev/fd0), IDE hard disks (/dev/hda) and SCSI hard disks
(/dev/sd1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2476f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Block Drivers
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Terminal drivers</em></span> (see Figure 4)
constitute a special set of character drivers for user
communication. For example, command tools in an open windows
environment, an X terminal or a console, are devices which require
special functions, e.g., the up and down arrows for a command
buffer manager or tabbing in the bash shell. Examples of block
drivers are /dev/tty0 or /dev/ttya (a serial port). In both cases
the kernel includes special routines, and the driver special
procedures, to cope with all particular features.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2476f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Terminal Drivers
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Streams</em></span> are the youngest drivers (see
Figure 5) and are designed for very high speed data flows. Both the
kernel and the driver include several protocol layers. The best
example of this type is a network driver.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2476f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Stream Drivers
</p></div></div><p>As we have said, a driver is a piece of a program. It is
composed of a set of C functions, some of which are mandatory. For
example, for a printer device, some typical functions only called
by the kernel, may be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_init()</b></span>:
Initializes the driver and is called only at boot time.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_open()</b></span>: Opens a
connection with the device.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_read()</b></span>: Reads
from the device.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_write()</b></span>: Writes
to the device.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_ioctl()</b></span>:
Performs device configuration operations.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_release()</b></span>:
Interrupts connection with device.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lp_irqhandler()</b></span>:
Specific functions called by the device to handle
interrupts.</p></li></ul></div><p>Some additional functions are available for particular
applications, like <span   class="bold"><b>*_lseek()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>*_readdir()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>*_select()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>*_mmap()</b></span>. You may find more
information about them in Michael Johnson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacker's
Guide</em></span> (see Resources).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x19f3dd0"></a>Do I Really Need to Write a Driver?</h2></div></div><p>There are several reasons for writing our own device
driver:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To solve concurrency problems when two or more
processes try to access a device at the same time.</p></li><li><p>To use hardware interrupts: as the kernel runs in
protected mode, the user cannot manage interrupts directly from a
program.</p></li><li><p>To handle other unusual applications, such as
managing a virtual device (a RAM disk or a device
simulator).</p></li><li><p>To obtain satisfaction as a programmer: writing a
driver increases personal motivation as well as control over the
computer.</p></li><li><p>To learn about the internal parts of the
system.</p></li></ul></div><p>Conversely, there are also several reasons for not writing
our own driver:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It requires a good deal of mental
preparation.</p></li><li><p>It requires low-level programming, i.e., direct
management of ports and interrupt handlers.</p></li><li><p>In the debug process, the kernel hangs easily, and
it is not possible to use debuggers or C library functions such as
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>In order to understand the following explanation, you must
know the C programming language, the basic I/O procedures, a
minimum about the internal architecture of a PC and have some
experience in the development of software applications for Unix
systems.</p><p>Finally, we must add that writing our own device driver is
only necessary when the device manufacturer does not supply a
driver for our OS or when we wish to add extra functionality to the
one we have.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x19f4668"></a>An Actual Example of a Driver</h2></div></div><p>The first question we answer is: why use Linux as an example
of how to write a driver? The answer is twofold: all the source
files are available in Linux, and I have a working example at my
lab in UPM-DISAM, Spain.</p><p>However, both the directory structure and the driver
interface with the kernel are OS dependent. Indeed small changes
may appear from one version or release to the next. For example,
several things changed from Linux 1.2.x to Linux 2.0.x, such as the
prototypes of the driver functions, the kernel configuration method
and the Makefiles for kernel compilation.</p><p>The device we have selected for our explanation is the MRV-4
Mobile Robot from the U.S. company Denning-Brach International
Robotics. Although the robot uses a PC with a specific board for
hardware interfacing (a motor/sonar card), the company does not
supply a driver for Linux. Nevertheless, all the source files of
the software, which control the robot through the motor/sonar card,
are available in C language for MS-DOS. The solution is to write a
driver for Linux. In the example, we use kernel release 2.0.24,
although it will also work in later versions with few
modifications.</p><p>The mobile platform is composed of a set of wheels coupled
with two motors (the drive and the steer), a set of 24 sonars which
act as proximity sensors for obstacle detection and a set of
bumpers which detect collisions. We need to implement a driver
with, at least, the following services
(<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>release</b></span> are mandatory):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>: to send
linear and angular velocity commands</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span>: to read
sonar measures and encoder values</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>three interrupt
handlers</b></span>: to store sonar measures when a sonar echo is
received, to implement an emergency stop when a bumper detects a
collision and to stop the steer motor when the wheels are located
at 0 (zero) degrees and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>go to home</em></span> flag is
active</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ioctl commands</b></span>:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>go to home</em></span> which sends a constant angular
velocity to the wheels and activates the <span   class="emphasis"><em>go to
home</em></span> flag; and configuration of motors and sonars</p></li></ul></div><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>go to home</em></span> service allows the user
to stop the wheels at an initial position which is always the same
(0 degrees). The incoming values from sonars and encoders, as well
as the velocity commands, might be part of the main loop of the
control program of the robot.</p><p>Returning to the initial scheme (Figure 1), the device is the
MRV-4 robot, the hardware interface is the motor/sonar card, the
source file of the driver will be mrv4.c, the new kernel we will
generate will be vmlinuz, the user program for kernel testing will
be <span   class="bold"><b>mrv4test.c</b></span> and the device will
be /dev/mrv4 (see Figure 6).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2476f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x1905b28"></a>General Programming Considerations</h2></div></div><p>To build a driver, these are the steps to follow:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Program the driver source files, giving special
attention to the kernel interface.</p></li><li><p>Integrate the driver into the kernel, including in
the kernel source calls to the driver functions.</p></li><li><p>Configure and compile the new kernel.</p></li><li><p>Test the driver, writing a user program.</p></li></ol></div><p>The directory structure of the Linux source files can be
described as follows: the /usr/src contains subdirectories such as
/xview and /linux. Inside the /linux directory, the different parts
of the kernel are classified into subdirectories: init, kernel,
ipc, drivers, etc. The directory /usr/src/linux/drivers/ contains
the driver sources, classified into categories such as block, char,
net, etc.</p><p>Another interesting directory is /usr/include, where the main
header files, such as stdio.h, are located. It contains two special
subdirectories:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/usr/include/system/, which includes system header
files, such as types.h</p></li><li><p>/usr/include/linux/, which includes the Linux
kernel headers such as lp.h, serial.h, mem.h and mrv4.h.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first task when programming the source files of a driver
is to select a name to identify it uniquely, such as hd, sd, fd,
lp, etc. In our case we decided to use mrv4. Our driver is going to
be a character driver, so we will write the source into the file
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/mrv4.c, and its header into
/usr/include/linux/mrv4.h.</p><p>The second task is to implement the driver I/O functions. In
our case, <span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_open()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_read()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_write()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_ioctl()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_release()</b></span>.</p><p>Special care must be taken when programming the driver
because of the following limitations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Standard library functions are not
available.</p></li><li><p>Some floating-point operations are not
available.</p></li><li><p>Stack size is limited.</p></li><li><p>It is not possible to wait for events, because the
kernel, and so all the processes, are stopped.</p></li></ul></div><p>The OS functions supported at kernel level are, of course,
only those functions programmed inside it:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>kmalloc()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>kfree()</b></span>: memory management</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>cli()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sti()</b></span>: enable/disable
interrupts</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>add_timer()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>init_timer()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>del_timer()</b></span>: timing
management</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>request_irq()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>free_irq()</b></span>: irq management</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>inb_p()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>outb_p()</b></span>: port management</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>memcpy_*fs()</b></span>: data
management</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>printk()</b></span>:
input/output</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>register_*dev()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>unregister_*dev()</b></span>: device
management</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>*sleep_on()</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>wake_up*()</b></span>: process
management</p></li></ul></div><p>Detailed information on these functions is given in
Johnson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Guide</em></span> (see Resources) or even
inside the kernel source files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x19074f0"></a>Low-Level Programming</h2></div></div><p>Access to the hardware interface (the card) is provided
through low-memory addressing. The I/O registers of the card, where
we can read/write information, are physically connected to memory
addresses of the PC (i.e., ports). For instance, the motor/sonar
card of the MRV-4 mobile robot is associated with the address
<b  >0x1b0</b>. Sixteen registers are used in this card,
so the port map includes addresses from <b  >0x1b0</b> to
<b  >0x1be</b>. A typical list of port addressing is
shown in Table 1.:</p><p><a href="2476t1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Table 1.
Typical Port Addresses</b></span></a></p><p>A free address region must be found to allocate the ports for
the new card. In Table 1, addresses from <b  >1b0</b> to
<b  >1be</b> were free. The source code example, foo.c,
is available on the SSC FTP site (see end of article) and includes
a call to a system function that allows us to see the previous
table of addresses. Finally, access to the ports is granted via the
functions <span   class="bold"><b>inb_p</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>outb_p</b></span>.</p><p>Interrupts are the other main topic when talking about
low-level programming and hardware control. Interrupt handling
versus polling has the main advantage that hardware is usually
slow. We cannot stop all processes in a computer until a printer
finishes a job. Instead, we can continue with normal work until the
printer finishes, then send an interrupt signal that is handled by
a specific function.</p><p>Continuing with our example, we need three handlers, one for
each of the hardware interrupts that the card can generate: sonars
handler (at irq <b  >0x0a</b>), home handler (at irq
<b  >0x0b</b>) and bumper handler (at irq
<b  >0x0c</b>). As example of what the source code must
do, we show the structure of the
<span   class="bold"><b>sonar_irq_hdlr</b></span> function. Each time
an echo from a sonar is received, it must:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Disable hardware interrupts.</p></li><li><p>Read sonar value from its port and store it in a
driver internal variable.</p></li><li><p>Enable interrupts again.</p></li></ol></div><p>If a user program wants to read the incoming data from the
sonars, it must perform a
<span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_read</b></span> operation, which returns
the data stored in the internal variables of the driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x1b83bc8"></a>Implementation of Driver Functions</h2></div></div><p>Although we will explain the guidelines to implement each of
the driver functions, when programming your own driver it is a good
idea to use the driver most similar to yours as an example. In our
case, the models for mrv4.c and mrv4.h are lp.c and lp.h,
respectively.</p><p>The file mrv4.c includes the initialisation and I/O
functions. The initialisation function
<span   class="bold"><b>mrv4_init</b></span> must follow these steps
(see guidelines in file foo.c):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Check in the device.</p></li><li><p>Get a free region for port addressing.</p></li><li><p>Test if hardware is present.</p></li><li><p>Test if irq numbers are free.</p></li><li><p>Initialise driver internal variables.</p></li><li><p>Return an OK status.</p></li></ol></div><p>If an error is detected in any of these steps, it must undo
all previous operations and return an error status. To implement
the I/O functions, the following structure (or similar) must be
defined and initialized in mrv4.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct   file_operations mrv4_fops = {
NULL,   /* mrv4_lseek   */
mrv4_read,      /* mrv4_read    */
mrv4_write,     /* mrv4_write   */
NULL,   /* mrv4_readdir */
NULL,   /* mrv4_select  */
mrv4_ioctl,     /* mrv4_ioctl   */
NULL,   /* mrv4_mmap    */
mrv4_open,      /* mrv4_open    */
mrv4_release    /* mrv4_release */
};
</pre><p>Pointers to all existent I/O functions must be set in this
structure. Then, the I/O function code can be implemented,
following the guidelines shown in the sidebar.
</p><p>The available commands are defined in the file mrv4.h (see
guidelines in file foo.h also available on the FTP site):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define MRV4_MAGIC, 0x07
#define MRV4_RESET      _IO(MRV4_MAGIC, 0x01

for example a pointer might be of type <b  >unsigned
int</b>. The magic number must be chosen by the programmer.
Try to select one not reserved by the system (see other header
files at /usr/include/linux). Constants are defined in the file
/usr/include/linux/mrv4.h, which must be included by both the
driver (mrv4.c) and the user programs. In general, the mrv4.h file
can include:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Constants and macros definitions</p></li><li><p>ioctl commands</p></li><li><p>Port names</p></li><li><p>Type definitions</p></li><li><p>Data structures to be exchanged between the driver
and the user</p></li><li><p>mrv4_init() function prototype</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x1b84988"></a>Driver Integration in the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The task of integrating the driver into the kernel includes
several steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Insert kernel calls to the new driver.</p></li><li><p>Add the driver to the list of drivers.</p></li><li><p>Modify compilation scripts.</p></li><li><p>Re-compile the driver.</p></li></ul></div><p>The insertion of the OS call to mrv4_init() is done in the
/usr/src/linux/kernel/mem.c file. The other driver function calls
(open, read, write, ioctl, release, etc.) are user transparent.
They are carried out through the file_operations structure. A
driver major number must be added to the list located at
/usr/include/linux/major.h. Search for a free driver number; for
example, if number 62 is free, you must add one or both of the
following lines to the file, depending on the Linux release:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/mrv4 62
#define MRV4_MAJOR 62
</pre><p>Each device is referenced by one major and one minor number.
The major number represents the number of the driver. The minor
number distinguishes between several devices which are controlled
by the same device (e.g., several hard disks controlled by the same
IDE driver: hd0, hd1, hd2).
</p><p>The next step is to create a logical device to access the
driver. You must use the command
<span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod -m og+rw /dev/mrv4 c 62 0
</pre><p>where <b  >62</b> is the major,
<b  >0</b> the minor (only one physical device) and
<b  >c</b> indicates a character device. Set the
permissions as necessary, although you can modify them later with
the command <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span>. For example,
enable <b  >rw</b> if you want to allow all users to
access the device:
<pre     class="programlisting">
crw-rw-rw-2 bin bin 62, 0 Mar 12 1997 /dev/mrv4
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x1b85220"></a>Driver Compilation and Testing</h2></div></div><p>To allow driver compilation within the kernel, the following
lines must be added to the script file
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/config.in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
comment 'MRV 4'
bool 'MRV 4 card support' CONFIG_MRV4
</pre><p>and the following lines to
/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/Makefile:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ifdef CONFIG_MRV4
  L_OBJS += mrv4.o
  endif
</pre>


It is recommended that the driver be compiled alone, before linking
the kernel. This method will save time testing syntax errors:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/char
gcc -c mrv4.c -Wall -D__KERNEL__
</pre>


And when all is well, delete the object file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rm -f mrv4.o
</pre>


Next, configure the kernel by typing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/src/linux
make config
</pre>


Answer <b  >yes</b> when the script asks you about
installing the MRV-4 driver (this sets the constant
<b  >CONFIG_MRV4</b>). Finally, insert an empty floppy
disk and re-build the kernel by typing the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make zdisk    # generate a bootable
# floppy disk
dev -R /dev/fd0 1   # disable writes to&lt;\n&gt;
# floppy
</pre>


Once you are sure that the kernel works, you can overwrite the file
vmlinuz with the new kernel. To test the new kernel, restart the
system (type <b  >reboot</b>) and ... good luck! There
are no debuggers available.
</p><p>If the kernel seems to work, you might test the driver by
writing one or more user programs, i.e., mrv4test.c which call the
driver functions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fid = open("/dev/mrv4", ...);
read(fid, ...);
write(fid, ...);
ioctl(fid, ...);
close(fid);
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1501580.0x1b85748"></a>How to Obtain Additional Information</h2></div></div><p>You can obtain privileged documentation at sunsite.unc.edu
(see Resources). But of course, you will never be able to write
your own driver using only the general guidelines of this article.
To facilitate this task, we supply the source files for a dummy
driver for Linux 2.0.24, which is a model for character driver
development. It simulates the equation <b  >y = a x</b>
and includes an example of interrupt management (which does not
work since it is not associated with any hardware). Its name is
foo, since Linux already has a driver called dummy. These files
