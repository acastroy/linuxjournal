    Here's an explanation of how Imake works and how you can use
    it to build your executables&mdash;an article for programmers
    with C and Unix programming skills.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230a348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Imake is tool for configuring the X
Window System and its components for different platforms and
compilers. Imake allows you to create a generic description of how
your project should be built and leaves the system-specific details
to centralized configuration files.
</p><p>Put simply, Imake is built on the idea of applying the C
preprocessor to Makefiles, rather than C programs. Much of the
redundancy in common Makefiles has been turned into preprocessor
macros, which have the same effect macros have in C
programs&mdash;making things easier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230a4a8"></a>Imake Commands and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Imake should have come with your installation of X. If you
run one of the common distributions of Linux, you need to check
that some of the &ldquo;development&rdquo; packages are installed. For
instance, I run Red Hat 4.0 on my system, and the Imake system is
contained in the XFree86-devel RPM.</p><p>If you aren't sure if you have Imake installed or have it
configured properly, it is easy to check. Just run these
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
touch Imakefile
xmkmf
</pre><p>There should now be a new file called Makefile in the current
directory. There is quite a bit of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the new Makefile,
mostly generic rules and information generated from the
configuration files.
</p><p>If you've gotten this far, Imake is installed and configured
just fine. Now, you should be able to run
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> and get output. For example
on my Red Hat 4.2 system, I type <b  >make</b> and get
the following output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make: Nothing to be done for 'emptyrule'.
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230a818"></a>Supporting Programs</h2></div></div><p>Besides containing many programs, there are several programs
that Imake depends on to function properly. However, most of them
are basic things like <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>mv</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span> and so on. If these basic
programs are missing, you have more severe problems than whether
Imake works properly. Still, there are a couple of major components
that aren't vital to a working Linux system that are vital to
Imake.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230aa28"></a>make</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> isn't necessarily vital
to the functioning of Imake, but the generated Makefiles are
absolutely useless by themselves. If you don't have make, you
should install GNU make. For more advanced uses of Imake, it is
good to have a thorough understanding of how make works. At the end
of this article are some references for more information on
make.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230ab88"></a>GCC</h2></div></div><p>Obviously, for a Makefile generation program to be useful,
you need a compiler. However, that is not the only reason for
having GCC installed. Imake relies on an external C preprocessor,
installed in /lib/cpp by default. If you have GCC installed and
configured, you should also have
<span   class="bold"><b>cpp</b></span> (the C preprocessor)
installed.</p><p>In case you don't have a /lib/cpp file, the simplest way to
solve the problem is to make a symbolic (soft) link (use
<span   class="bold"><b>ln</b></span>) from it to GCC's cpp
executable. For example, on my system, /lib/cpp is a symbolic link
to /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.7.2/cpp.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230ad98"></a>Imakefile Contents, a Jump Start</h2></div></div><p>The major user-visible component of the Imake system is the
file Imakefile, in which the project-specific information needed by
Imake to build your project is kept.</p><p>At a basic level Imakefile consists of rule invocations,
variable definitions and variable invocations. The first, rule
invocations, resemble C-function calls. The second resemble
C-variable assignments. These two should be familiar to anyone who
has used macros in C code. On the other hand, variable invocations
are nothing like their C counterparts, but should be familiar to
anyone who has done any work with plain make. Here's a simple
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
VARIABLE = value
ARule(arg1,arg2,$(VARIABLE))
</pre><p>As with programming in general, there are many of syntax
pitfalls with Imake. The following two sections describe a few of
the problems to keep in mind.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230afa8"></a>Argument Warnings</h2></div></div><p>Imake (actually, the underlying C preprocessor) is fairly
strict about how the various rules must be invoked. First, there
must be absolutely no extraneous white space around the commas
between arguments. For example, this rule is
<span   class="bold"><b>incorrect</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ARule(arg1, arg2, arg3)
</pre><p>and this version is <span   class="bold"><b>correct</b></span>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ARule(arg1,arg2,arg3)
</pre>


To confuse things even more, in some cases, it is valid for the
argument to have space. For example, many rules take a list of
files as one of the arguments, where each file is delimited by a
space. Typically, this is fairly intuitive, and several of the
examples later in this article show the most common cases.
</p><p>The second problem with argument passing in Imake is empty
arguments. Not all arguments are necessary for every rule, but the
C preprocessor breaks if an argument is left out or has no value.
To solve the problem, Imake provides the macro NullParameter to
allow empty arguments in a rule. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ARule(arg1,NullParameter,arg3)
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230b318"></a>Comment Warnings</h2></div></div><p>There are two different ways to include comments in your
Imakefile. The first is standard C-style comments, opening with the
/* characters and closing with the */ characters. Anything between
the two is completely ignored. The second style of comment uses the
string XCOMM to start the comment, and a line break ends it.</p><p>The basic difference between the two is what appears in the
final generated Makefile. C-style comments don't show up at all in
the generated Makefile, while XCOMM comments do. Put simply,
instances of XCOMM are replaced with a # character. One item to
remember about XCOMM comments, since the C preprocessor doesn't
know to ignore them, it will gladly process anything it sees as a
macro inside an XCOMM comment. In other words, an invalid rule
invocation that looks to be commented out can cause the Makefile
generation to fail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230b478"></a>The (Common) Rules</h2></div></div><p>There are many rules provided by the Imake configuration
files. Some of the most common and useful are described here. Note
that the rules used in the presented examples are not necessarily
compatible with each other. Do not intermix rules from the
different examples.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230b580"></a>Rule 1. SimpleProgramTarget()</h2></div></div><p>This rule, as you can tell by its name, is the simplest one
that Imake provides. It generates a simple Makefile that compiles a
single program from a single source file. Say you have a source
file, prog.c, and you wish to compile it into an executable called
prog. You need only a single line in the Imakefile such as this
one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SimpleProgramTarget(prog)
</pre><p>To try it out, write a short &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; type program in
C and an appropriate Imakefile. Then, run
<span   class="bold"><b>xmkmf</b></span> and make. Your &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo; program should compile without problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230b790"></a>Rule 2. ComplexProgramTarget()</h2></div></div><p>Since it's difficult to write complex programs with only a
single source file, this rule was created to allow a single
executable to be built from multiple source files. However, with
the added flexibility comes a cost, you have to add information
about which source files to use. For example, if you have a project
with foo.c and bar.c that will create an executable called foobar,
your Imakefile should look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SRCS = foo.c bar.c
OBJS = foo.o bar.o
ComplexProgramTarget(foobar)
</pre><p>There are three other rules that are similar to
ComplexProgramTarget() but not quite the same. They are called
ComplexProgramTarget_1(), ComplexProgramTarget_2() and
ComplexProgramTarget_3(). The basic idea behind these rules is to
allow a single Imakefile to generate targets for more than one
program.
</p><p>Although, these rules are similar to ComplexProgramTarget()
there are some minor differences. The first and most obvious one,
is the different way to specify source files. Instead of setting
SRCS and OBJS, you use SRCS1, OBJS1, SRCS2, OBJS2, SRCS3 and OBJS3.
The second is the rules take different arguments. These rules take
an additional two arguments. The second and third arguments are a
way to specify local and system libraries that must be linked into
the final executable. Here is an example of how to use these
rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PROGRAMS = foobar1 foobar2 foobar3
SRCS1 = foo1.c bar1.c
OBJS1 = foo1.c bar1.c
SRCS2 = foo2.c bar2.c
OBJS2 = foo2.c bar2.c
SRCS3 = foo3.c bar3.c
OBJS3 = foo3.c bar3.c
ComplexProgramTarget_1(foobar1,NullParameter,\
        NullParameter)
ComplexProgramTarget_2(foobar2,NullParameter,\
        NullParameter)
ComplexProgramTarget_3(foobar3,NullParameter,\
        NullParameter)
</pre><p>Note that the last two rules will not function properly
without the first. You cannot have a ComplexProgramTarget_2() or
ComplexProgramTarget_3() without having a ComplexProgramTarget_1().
The reasons for this are related to the internals of the rule
definitions. To discover the reason why, read the O'Reilly Imake
book mentioned in Resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x230ba50"></a>Rule 3. NormalProgramTarget()</h2></div></div><p>This rule is by far the most useful. It can be used an
arbitrary number of times and can use an arbitrary number of source
files to build the executable. Again, along with added flexibility,
there is added complexity. The usage of this rule given by
Imake.rules is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NormalProgramTarget(
        <span   class="emphasis"><em>locallibs</em></span>,<span   class="emphasis"><em>syslibs</em></span>)
</pre><p>This is how the arguments are defined:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>program</b></span>: name of
the executable being built</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>objects</b></span>: names of
object files to be built from source. This argument replaces the
functionality of the OBJS variables in the various
ComplexProgramTarget() rules.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>deplibs</b></span>: libraries
that the executable needs</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>locallibs</b></span>: local
(to the project) libraries to link</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>syslibs</b></span>: system
libraries to link</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>Note that in the last three arguments there is some
redundancy. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>deplibs</em></span> argument is a list of
the library file names which the program needs. This list is used
by Imake to build a proper Makefile that will rebuild the
executable if any of those files change. The last two arguments,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>locallibs</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>syslibs</em></span> are
the same libraries, but expressed as command-line options to tell
the compiler to link those libraries. Naturally, this is done so
that Imake knows how to properly build the executable with all the
necessary libraries.</p><p><a href="2171l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> uses
NormalProgramTarget() to reproduce the functionality of the
ComplexProgramTarget() example. The advantage, of course, is that
program targets can be added or removed without affecting each
other.</p><p>Note that the use of the variables SRCS1, OBJS1 and so on are
simply for convenience. Unlike ComplexProgramTarget(), these
variables are not used in the definition of the rule. When it comes
time to change the list of sources and objects, it's easier to find
them at the front of the Imakefile as a variable definition than to
search through the rule invocations to find all the
instances.</p><p>On the other hand, the variable SRCS is a different case.
Notice two new rules, DependTarget() and LintTarget(). These two
rules create the targets <span   class="bold"><b>depend</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span>, respectively. To be able
to do their job, these rules need the variable SRCS set to a list
of the source files in the project. Note that in the previous
examples the depend and lint targets were created automatically;
the function of these targets is explained later.</p><p>There is one more new rule in this example, AllTarget().
Again, because NormalProgramTarget() does less work than the other
rules, you have to do more work. Quite simply, each instance of
AllTarget() adds another dependency to the &ldquo;all&rdquo; target in the
final Makefile. AllTarget() is called by default for each program
to be built.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x2704850"></a>The Files</h2></div></div><p>There are various files involved in the Imake build system;
most reside in the Imake configuration directory. Though only one
file, Imakefile, is really important to simple uses of Imake, these
descriptions are included as a sort of a road map to more in-depth
understanding of how Imake works.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Imakefile is the file used to generate a Makefile.
This file contains your project specific information.</p></li><li><p>Makefile is the final output file. There are many
references to help you understand the contents of the Makefile. The
easiest to obtain is probably the GNU Info pages on GNU make, which
come with the GNU make distribution. See the References section for
specifics on information available about make.</p></li><li><p>Imake.tmpl is a generic template used to fill in
information not provided by the Imakefile. Most template files are
created for large projects that need to customize Imake beyond what
is possible through the Imakefile. (The FVWM source as an
example.)</p></li><li><p>Imake.rules and other .rules files hold the C
preprocessor &ldquo;defines&rdquo; that make up the bulk of the Imake rules.
Things like SimpleProgramTarget() and DependTarget() are defined in
this file.</p></li><li><p>.cf files contain system specific configuration
information. Imake.cf is the file that &ldquo;chooses&rdquo; the proper
platform-specific .cf file.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x2704d20"></a>Putting Imake to Work</h2></div></div><p>Once you've written a basic Imakefile, it's time to put Imake
to work. Fortunately, the difficult part is over. Just type the
following two commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xmkmf -a
make
</pre><p>If you've written your Imakefile properly, your project will
build with no problems.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xmkmf</b></span> is a Bourne shell
script that wraps up the <span   class="bold"><b>imake</b></span>
command. It calls imake with convenient default arguments and does
some cleanup, such as copying the old Makefile to Makefile.bak.
This program generates the Makefile from your Imakefile.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>imake</b></span> is a program that you
almost never need to run by hand. It's the program that handles the
brunt of running the C preprocessor, as well as some minor tweaking
(i.e., XCOMM comments) for compatibility with make.</p><p>Without any arguments, xmkmf just saves the old Makefile and
runs imake to generate a new Makefile from the Imakefile. If you
give xmkmf the <b  >-a</b> switch, it runs the following
commands in the given order:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make Makefile
make includes
make depend
</pre><p>See the xmkmf(1) man pages for more details on xmkmf
capabilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x27051f0"></a>The Targets</h2></div></div><p>Below is a list of the common make targets contained in an
Imake generated Makefile. Precisely which targets end up in your
Makefile depend on which rules you used in your Imakefile, of
course. A given target always does the same thing regardless of the
project. (That is, it will if the Imakefile has been written
properly.) In fact, these targets are standard beyond Imake. For
example, the GNU Coding Standards specify much the same
targets.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span>: Build the
whole project. Usually the default target. This is the target to
which the AllTarget() rule adds a dependency.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>clean</b></span>: Remove
buildable files and backup files. Includes all object files,
executables, backup Makefiles and files commonly used by editors as
backup files (*~).</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Makefiles</b></span>:
regenerates all the Makefiles using Imake.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>depend</b></span>: generates
the dependences between source (*.c) and header (*.h) files and
ensures that all object files that need recompiling are
rebuilt.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>tags</b></span>: builds the
tags database used by vi and Emacs. The tags database is simply a
list of C-language symbols and their location in the source. It
allows for quickly and automatically locating function definitions
and other such objects. See the man pages for etags(1), ctags(1),
vi(1) and the Info documentation that comes with Emacs.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>install</b></span>: installs
the final binaries into the main file system. Defaults to a
directory under /usr/X11R6/ depending on each type of component.
For example, executables go in /bin; man pages go into the proper
section directory under /man.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span>: This target
isn't particularly useful on Linux systems, since there isn't a
commonly used <span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span> program.
<span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span> is a program that checks C
code for common style problems and other non-syntactic mistakes.
The GNU compiler has moved much of the functionality of lint into
the compiler, compile your code with the <b  >-Wall</b>
flag set and you'll have most of lint's functionality. With a lint
program installed on the system, you can use this make target to
run lint on all the source files of the project.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2212580.0x2705b90"></a>Custom Imake Rules</h2></div></div><p>In some cases, it is useful to write your own custom rules
for generating Makefiles. The Imake system makes it easy to specify
a different set of configuration files than the usual
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config. This kind of customization is beyond the
scope of this article, but O'Reilly publishes a great book on Imake
that has several chapters devoted specifically to this topic. See
Resources for more information on that book.</p><p><a href="2171s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
