    Linux community is the fact they will
    release the source code for Communicator starting with 5.0.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a79580.0x1b711e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome to my attempt to write a &ldquo;Stop
the Presses&rdquo; with a subject that really asks to be editorialized
on. First, let me set the scene: today is January 22. The important
events of this day are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Bill Clinton is once again accused of a sexual
impropriety.</p></li><li><p>The Pope is in Cuba.</p></li><li><p>Netscape has announced that their browser is now
free and that they will freely distribute the source code for
it.</p></li><li><p>Microsoft has somewhat folded in its browser battle
with the U.S. Justice Department.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>The first two items are just for context&mdash;it has been an
exciting day. I am really here to discuss the last two
items.</p><p>Let's get the Microsoft information out of the way first. My
understanding is that a compromise has been reached between
Microsoft and the justice department&mdash;the Internet Explorer icon
will not appear on the desktop, but the browser itself will still
be included. As the easiest way to get a new browser is to download
it off the Internet and 90% of all personal computers today come
with Microsoft Windows, it seems that all we have done is made it a
little harder for Internet Explorer to be on 90% of the desktops.
Hopefully, there will be further developments in the Microsoft vs.
the U.S. Justice Department game.</p><p>The Netscape item has two parts. The first, making the
browser available for free really is a necessity; 90% of new
personal computers come with Windows and, thus, Internet Explorer.
Whether IE is better than anything Netscape offers or not isn't the
issue if one comes with your computer and you have to go buy and
install the other one. Numbers back up this statement. Netscape
used to account for about 90% of the browser market while 60% is
probably the case today.</p><p>The good news for Netscape is that they have managed to shift
their revenue stream away from stand-alone client software. Their
own numbers show that in the fourth quarter of 1997 these revenues
were only 13% of the total, down from 45% a year earlier.</p><p>By far the most interesting part of Netscape's announcement
for the Linux community is the fact they will release the source
code for Communicator starting with 5.0. Sure, this will also make
a change for them in the Windows arena and may force Microsoft to
make some brave decision as well, but let's look at what this does
for the Linux community.</p><p>The first thing I see is talk on the Gnome mailing list about
a version of Navigator using Gnome. Call it Gnomescape, it is
potentially a full-featured browser with a look and feel that is
likely to become the Linux standard. [For more on Gnome see the
&ldquo;KDE and Gnome&rdquo; article by Larry Ayers in issue 24 of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, January 1998.]</p><p>Netscape claims they are releasing the code to allow the
Internet community to contribute to the development. (I expect
Linux helped them realize that is possible.) For us, this can mean
that instead of complaining about Netscape bugs, we can fix them. I
expect, based on Linux history, the best, most bug-free version of
Netscape will appear on Linux systems first.</p><p>Free Communicator and free source code mean that Linux
systems become a much cheaper choice for &ldquo;Web Appliances&rdquo;. It
also means inexpensive kiosks at shopping malls, car dealers, etc.
While I am sure Netscape made this decision to help their
competitive position with Microsoft, I think we will see a huge
impact on the Linux scene. Of course, if Linux replaces Windows as
the operating system installed on 90% of the PCs sold today,
Netscape will be as happy as the Linux community.</p><p>What's still up in the air is what sort of license the source
code will fall under. GPL is one choice; a license more like that
of BSD is another. Check out &ldquo;Linux News&rdquo; and the discussion
groups on our web site [http://www.linuxjournal.com/] to get
up-to-the-minute information on what is happening.</p></div></div>
