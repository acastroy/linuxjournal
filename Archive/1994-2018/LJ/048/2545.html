    Mr. Shapiro shows us how to write a program to compute
    internal rate of return using three programming languages
    supported by Linux&mdash;Perl, C and Java.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263a580.0x27322f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The world of finance is rife with
mathematical formulas. We are all familiar with the elementary ones
like those for compound interest or tallying up the value of a
savings account if we add a certain amount each month over a period
of time. These kinds of formulas are fairly simple and, in general,
they can be handled with nothing more than a calculator. Loan
amortizations and their inverse, sinking funds, are a little more
difficult, but even these types of financial problems succumb to
either a calculator or a simple computer program.
</p><p>In this article I would like to consider a more difficult
problem, usually referred to as finding the internal rate of return
(IRR). Stated simply, if we make a number of expenditures at
different times and receive a number of payments, also at different
times, what is the effective interest rate? Because the times are
not constrained to regular intervals, the simple formulas referred
to above are inadequate. In fact, amortizations, such as car and
home loans, are a special case of IRR where the payments and time
intervals are both constant. For example, a standard four-year car
loan with fixed monthly payments is really an IRR problem where you
receive one lump sum at time zero (the loan value) and pay it back
in 48 installments. These installments happen to be equal and
happen to occur at equal time intervals, namely monthly.</p><p>We will first develop the equation for the IRR, then solve it
with three equivalent programs in Perl, C and Java. This way you
can compare the same algorithm in three different languages. I have
found this an interesting and efficient way to learn computer
languages. As an added treat we will handle both the discrete and
continuous compounding cases in each program. When we are done, you
will have a very general program (three programs, actually) which
can handle almost any financial interest rate problem.</p><p>The trick to working with money problems is to understand a
concept called &ldquo;the time value of money&rdquo;. If someone agrees to
give you $100 a year from now, that promise is, for financial
purposes, worth less than $100. And, if the $100 is promised two
years hence, it is worth even less. Conversely, if you agree to
give someone $100 a year from now, you can start with less than
that now and let your money earn a year's interest before parting
with it. People are willing to pay a premium to be able to have
things sooner rather than later, and this idea leads to the concept
of interest and the time value of money.</p><p>Let us consider, for the moment, only discrete compounding,
and let us further restrict the discussion to annual compounding,
at say eight percent. Our $100 invested for one year increases to
$108. Leave it invested for another year and we have $116.64. So,
we can see that the general formula for determining the value
<b  >V</b> of <b  >D</b> dollars invested at
interest rate <span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> percent for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>t</em></span> years is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
V = D * (1 + i / 100) t
</pre><p>or, in our case,
<pre     class="programlisting">
V = 100 * (1.08) t
</pre>


In general, we multiply by (1 + i / 100) t to find values in the
future and divide by the same factor to find past values. And this
explains why and how the state lotteries can give you the choice of
taking your winnings as either a series of checks at future time
intervals or as one lump sum now. The lump sum results from
reducing each of those checks by the above factor (calculated
separately for each time interval) and summing the resulting
amounts. The lump sum is, of course, always smaller than the total
of all those checks, and that is the amount you sacrifice to have
the money now rather than later. We will come back to lotteries
later after we develop our programs.
</p><p>We are now in a position to state the rule that governs
financial transactions that take place over a period of time: the
sum of all the transactions, corrected to the same (any) time using
the IRR must total zero. If you think about this for a minute it
makes perfectly good sense because, if the interest rate was zero,
all of the correction factors would be one and this rule would
state no more than the simple fact that expenditures must equal
income. Interest compounds (no pun intended) the problem by
introducing those pesky correction factors to account for the
increase of money with time.</p><p>First, the transaction values have to be signed, with inflows
typically positive and outflows negative (although reversing the
signs consistently will not affect the resulting IRR). Let us take
an easy example. You deposit $100 in the bank, withdrawing $40 one
year later and $70 after two years. Correcting all transactions to
the present, the IRR is the value of <b  >i</b> that
satisfies the equation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-100 + 40 / (1 + i / 100) + 70 /
        ((1 + i / 100) 2) = 0
</pre><p>I will leave it to the reader to solve this one with the hint
to define x = (1 + i / 100) and solve for x first, then i.
Congratulations, if you got i = 6.02%. You probably solved a
quadratic equation, and if so, you may have noticed the reason for
the quadratic&mdash;three different transactions: now and one and two
years hence. These kinds of problems get increasingly hard as the
number of time periods increase and that provides the motivation
for our program(s).
</p><p>Before I present an algorithm to address financial problems,
let us expand our scope to include not only discrete compounding
but continuous compounding as well. This turns out to be very easy.
Our factors become exponentials instead of powers, so (1 + i /100)
t is replaced by exp(i * t / 100) . Money compounded continuously
grows faster than money compounded discretely at the same rate and
for this reason IRRs for continuous compounding are smaller than
IRRs for the same discrete problem. You may wish to try recomputing
our $100 bank account problem for continuous compounding. The IRR
for this problem is 5.85%.</p><p>Let us agree on a straightforward input format with one
dollar, time pair per line with both dollars and times as
floating-point numbers for complete generality. For our little bank
account problem the input file is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-100 0.0
  40 1.0
  70 2.0
</pre><p>Note the negative sign on the investment.
</p><p>I chose Newton's method to solve this problem, mainly because
I know that the powers in the problem and their derivatives are
well-behaved functions. More importantly, however, we have a handle
on the IRR. Interest rates are usually in the 3% to 20% range,
allowing us to choose a starting value that is, for most real world
problems, going to ensure convergence.</p><p>Initially, I used a straightforward algorithm, applying
Newton's method directly to the IRR equation. While I was
successful, I noted that for some data sets the number of
iterations required was disturbingly large. I plotted the IRR
equation against the interest and quickly discovered the problem.
Newton's method owes its simplicity to the neglect of all terms
beyond linear ones, and thus, it works best when higher-order terms
are relatively small. Another way of saying the same thing is that
the closer the function is to a straight line, the quicker the
linear Newton's method converges.</p><p>My plots revealed significant curvature of the IRR function,
so I tried manipulating the equation into a &ldquo;flatter&rdquo; form. The
trick is to collect the time-corrected terms into separate negative
(expenses) and positive (income) groups. If we denote the sums as
pos_sum and neg_sum we have equality:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pos_sum = neg_sum
</pre><p>where both sums are positive numbers. Dividing both sides of
this equation by pos_sum and taking the logarithm of the result we
have:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln(neg_sum / pos_sum) = 0
</pre>


The logarithm flattens the function and makes for very quick
convergence. The slight trade-off of having to calculate the log is
more than compensated for by the reduction in the number of
iterations. I made the following substitution:
<pre     class="programlisting">
exp(-u) = 1 + i
</pre>


and solved for <b  >u</b> first, then
<b  >i</b>, which simplifies the calculations even more.
</p><p>Three listings are available for anonymous download from
<a href="../listings/048/2545.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue48/2545.tgz</a>:
<a href="2545l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is the Perl program,
irr.pl;<a href="2545l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is the same
program in C, irr.c; and Listing 3, irr.java, is the equivalent
Java code. Due to space considerations only the Perl code is
printed here (see Listing 1).</p><p>Let us look at the Perl program first. It is the shortest of
the three programs, in part because of Perl's many built-in
functions and in part because of Perl's built-in memory management.
It displays a simple usage message and exits should the user forget
the expected format. There are three constants, one to control the
maximum number of iterations before exiting the Newton loop, one to
decide if convergence has occurred, and a starting value for the
IRR (<b  >u = i = 0.0</b>).</p><p>The data file is read in a loop, using the arrays
<b  >@pos_d</b>, <b  >@pos_t</b>,
<b  >@neg_d</b> and <b  >@neg_t</b> to hold the
income and expenses and their respective times. Note that Perl
dynamically allocates memory for the arrays as the data is read.
The write function performs formatted output using the formats at
the end of the program. Before starting the Newton algorithm loop
we make sure the input data contains both income and expenses&mdash;the
algorithm will not converge unless it does.</p><p>The <b  >for</b> loop on the variable
<b  >$iters</b> is the Newton algorithm, where
<b  >$d_neg</b> and <b  >$d_pos</b> are the
derivatives with respect to <b  >u</b> of the numerator
and denominator, respectively. The program concludes with a display
of the IRR if convergence is attained. Note that scalar variables
start with a dollar sign and arrays with an @ sign. Variables and
arrays do not have types and can contain strings or numbers with
the type being determined by usage.</p><p>Note that Perl's print function accepts variable names and
interpolates the actual value, whereas
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> works pretty much like its
C counterpart. Also, you can put &ldquo;if&rdquo; tests after the statements
they control.</p><p>As a non-trivial example, consider the data set in Listing 2.
In this example you spend $1000 today, get back $500 in a year,
only to spend another $2000 two years from today, etc., with a
total of six transactions spread out over five years. We can run
the Perl program with this data set by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
irr.pl irr.dat
</pre><p>This results in a display of the input data followed by the
line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
IRR = 10.6952% (discrete) = 10.1611% (continuous) after 3 iterations.
</pre>


Note that it takes a higher interest rate when compounding is
discrete to give the same return as continuous compounding. You
will, of course, get the same results from the other two programs.
</p><p>The C program is longer than its Perl equivalent&mdash;about twice
as long. In the C program, I chose to define a structure for the
dollar and time pairs. One complication&mdash;I had to scan the input
data twice: the first time to determine the number of pairs so that
I could use <span   class="bold"><b>malloc</b></span> to allocate
memory for the array of structures, the second to actually load the
data into memory. In this program I placed the Newton algorithm in
a static function called <span   class="bold"><b>irr</b></span>. This
function is of a defined type, ITERATOR, and returns either OK or
NO_CONVERGE depending on whether the algorithm converges. The
iterating function looks very much like the equivalent Perl
code.</p><p>The Java program for IRR is longer yet, partly because of the
exception checking, but also because I defined several classes in
addition to my public <span   class="bold"><b>Irr</b></span> class.
There are no structures in Java, so I put the input data into its
own <span   class="bold"><b>Expenses</b></span> class. I used the
interface <b  >Do_irr_returns</b> to hold the return
values as the equivalent to the C enumerations for the same
purpose. This organization of the program into classes and
interfaces tends to increase the amount of code, but leads to clear
and easy-to-read programs. The <b  >MyDouble</b> and
<b  >MyInt</b> classes serve another purpose, as
well.</p><p>In Java, native variables are passed by value. There is no
concept of passing by address, at least for individual built-in
variables. One way around this limitation is to create classes as
wrappers and then to pass the classes to methods. The
<b  >MyDouble</b> class is endowed with a constructor, so
that we can set an initial value for <b  >du</b>.</p><p>Note that there was no reason to scan the input data twice in
this case. The variable <b  >in_data</b> of type Vector
grows automatically as elements are added&mdash;no allocating or
reallocating of memory is necessary.</p><p>I contacted my state lottery in Colorado and came up with a
good IRR problem. If you win the lottery, you have a choice of
taking a lump sum equal to 40% of your winnings or 25 payments
starting with 1/40 of your winnings followed by checks that
increase by 3.7% each year. For example, if you win a million
dollars you can walk away with a check for $400,000 (less federal
and state withholding taxes of 28% and 4%, respectively) or receive
yearly payments starting with $25,000, then $25,925, etc., through
the last check for $59,790.22 (withholding applies to these checks,
too). Add up those 25 checks and, indeed, you get your million
dollars. (For you purists, or if you just like to count your
pennies, you will note that the exact total is $1,000,066.48. The
true increase each year is slightly less than 3.7%.) The question
faced by every lottery winner is whether it is better to take the
lump sum or the payments over time. From a strictly financial
standpoint the question is answered once the IRR is determined.
That is, at what interest rate would you have to invest the
$400,000 to be able to write yourself the same 25 checks? The
answer will be in my next article.</p><p>We have looked at the problem of determining the effective
interest rate for a series of expenditures and returns of arbitrary
amounts and occurring at arbitrary times. We developed the equation
for the internal rate of return and manipulated it into a form that
is suitable for application of Newton's method. We looked at
equivalent programs in Perl, C and Java. You can use these programs
to solve for interest rates and to compare investments for any
problem involving transactions over time.</p></div></div>
