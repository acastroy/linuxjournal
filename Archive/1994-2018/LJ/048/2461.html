application. A large number of the applications under Linux use
Tcl/Tk (here after referred to as &ldquo;Tcl applications&rdquo;) as the GUI
front end. Tcl has become popular under Linux for a variety of
reasons: flexibility, ease of use, availability of source code,
liberal license policy and the gorgeous look to the Tk widget set.
If you're curious and want to learn more about Tcl or if you just
want to become more comfortable with the language,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Programming in Tcl &amp; Tk</em></span> by Brent
B. Welch is a book you'll want to read and refer to often.</p><p>A member of the development team for Tcl at Sun, Mr. Welch is
perhaps best known to the Linux community for his work developing
EXMH, the best mail reader under Linux (small personal bias
inserted). In this 2nd revision of his book, he uses 613 pages to
lead the user from the fundamental paradigm of Tcl scripts, to
using Tk and writing extensions in C.</p><p>The book is divided into seven sections covering Tcl Basics,
Advanced Tcl, Tk Basics, Tk Widgets, Tk Details, Tcl and C, and
Changes. Each chapter begins first with a short paragraph
introducing the subject, followed by detailed discussions, tables
and a plethora of examples. A helpful feature of this book is the
&ldquo;Hot Tips&rdquo; marked in the margins, these indicate something
particularly useful, tricky or non-obvious.</p><p>The section on the Tcl language pleased me immensely; often
books fly through the fundamentals of Tcl in order to get to the
more &ldquo;glamorous&rdquo; Tk section. Tcl is powerful and rich, but can
sometimes be a confusing language especially if you don't fully
understand the fundamentals. The author's thorough explanation of
the basic constructs and group-substitute-evaluate paradigm of the
Tcl language was nicely done and clarified my understanding. Anyone
who writes Tcl scripts would benefit from reading the first section
a few times.</p><p>The sections on Tk widgets clearly explain not only the
syntax and use of the widgets, but through the extensive use of
examples really drive home how to most effectively use them. The
book also discusses techniques on how to solve, in a simple manner,
problems that face many Tk programmers (such as having a scroll bar
attached to two listboxes).</p><p>The sections on the Tcl C API are very well done and
excellent reading for anyone who is trying to integrate Tcl into a
larger application. Not only does the author give a nice overview
of the API from a task perspective; he also provides several
tricks. My favorite is <span   class="bold"><b>Tcl_Invoke</b></span>
a C procedure that allows the invocation of Tcl commands without
the overhead of substations that come with
<span   class="bold"><b>Tcl_Eval</b></span>.</p><p>Included with the book is a CD-ROM containing all of the
examples from the book and a small browser application to help
access and run the examples. Perhaps I am being a bit overly
critical, but I was a little disappointed with the included browser
application. It would have been nice to include a really glitzy Tcl
browser to really show off the strengths of the language. Sadly,
the included application, although usable, was a little stark and
would certainly not inspire a new user of Tcl to get excited about
the language. Also included were a collection of Tcl scripts and
extensions from the various FTP sites; again it would have been
nice if a few more of them had been unpacked and ready to run off
the CD.</p><p>Although this book is described as being useful for the
beginner, as well as expert Tcl user, it really shines for people
with at least a little programming knowledge. In some ways the
breadth and detail of the book (not to mention its weight) could be
a little intimidating for a newcomer. For the true beginner I still
like John Ousterhout's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the Tk Toolkit</em></span>
(although it's getting a bit dated).</p><p>Throughout the book the author pulls no punches. Covering the
language in great detail and providing many useful tricks, he is
equally quick to point out potential pitfalls, inefficient commands
and constructs that although legal &ldquo;probably aren't a good
idea&rdquo;.</p><p>A great amount of attention is spent throughout the book
delineating features that apply to a specific release of Tcl or a
specific computer platform (Unix, Windows, Mac). This is
particularly helpful if you are interested in writing truly
cross-platform scripts. Whenever possible, attention is given to
writing code that will work across multiple platforms and revisions
of Tcl. Because the author is part of the design team at Sun, he
was able to cover some of the new features introduced in Tcl 8.0
including namespaces, binary string support and the on-the-fly
compiler.</p><p>Without a doubt this book lives up to its name. It provides
an extremely practical view of Tcl and Tk, pointing out its
features and flaws while focusing on writing scripts that &ldquo;get the
job done.&rdquo; Mr. Welch has written a book that is essential reading
and reference material for anyone who writes Tcl code or integrates
it into a larger application.</p></div></div>
