    If you have a dial-up connection to the Internet, one of
    your easiest options for getting and receiving e-mail is
    popmail. But to use popmail, you need a &ldquo;popmail client&rdquo;.
    XF-Mail is a convenient, easy-to-use, and reasonably
    powerful popmail client that is worth a closer look.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1289580.0x1381558"></a></h2></div></div><p>I suspect that there are a
<span   class="bold"><b>lot</b></span> of folks who are in a position
similar to mine: using Unix at school or work on a minicomputer or
mainframe, and running Linux on our PCs at home. If this is the
case, it is quite likely that your Internet connection is via a
dial-up connection, PPP, CSLIP, or SLIP. If this is the case, your
options for getting mail into and out of your Linux box have almost
invariably included having to set up sendmail, sendmail+IDA, or
smail. Setting any of these up is not a trivial task. If you are
fortunate, your choices also include
<span   class="bold"><b>popmail</b></span>, in which your mail is
left on a <span   class="emphasis"><em>popmail server</em></span> in your own mailbox,
waiting for you to retrieve it at your leisure. But to retrieve it,
you need a mail program installed on your Linux box which can talk
to the popmail server.
</p><p>XF-Mail To the Rescue.</p><p>What I'd like to do is take an in-depth look at compiling and
configuring XF-Mail. Let me offer one caveat at this point: this is
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> meant to insult anyone's
intelligence. I'm writing this primarily for the benefit of those
DOS-converts, like myself, who may initially view the notion of
compiling programs as a task for wizards. It's not that bad.
Honest! However, until you get the hang of this, getting Linux
programs working may well be a formidable task. If you're pretty
adept at compiling programs, you may want to skip to the next
section, on configuration, although even that is admittedly pretty
straightforward.</p><p>Just a word for those of you who are left. If you are an
absolute Linux newbie and the thought of compiling anything sorta
gives you the heebie-jeebies, stick with me. This will be fun.
Really!</p><p>The philosophy behind Linux, and much of Unix, is vastly
different from that of DOS. While you can often find pre-compiled
binaries that work simply by dropping them into a directory in your
path, there are MANY instances in which this is simply not the
case. You'll get an archive with the .tar.gz suffix and un-archive
it, only to discover that it's all source code and needs to be
compiled. Eventually, you'll want to be able to do this. It's often
not as hard as it first seems, although admittedly, not everything
compiles cleanly &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;.</p><p>I'm going to take you through each step needed to compile
XF-Mail. I think this is extremely important, for a couple
reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>This will be good practice in compiling and setting
up a couple programs that are quite well behaved and need little
modification to get working.</p></li><li><p>If you're using Linux on a home PC and have a
dial-up connection, you really need to have an easy-to-use e-mail
client. You need to be connected. Seriously. You're quite
handicapped and cut off if you don't.</p></li><li><p>If you've never compiled anything under Linux, this
is your golden opportunity to do so and feel pretty good about
yourself!</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's begin. You'll need to have a few things set up in order
to do this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You need to have X-Windows up and running.</p></li><li><p>You need to have installed the development
applications&mdash;for those of you using Slackware, that's the stuff in
the D disk sets. Other distributions will use different
designations. You should have the GCC (GNU C Compiler) installed,
as well as the include files and so forth.</p></li><li><p>You need to ftp some files.</p></li><li><p>You need to be able to use at least one of the
Linux text editors such as vi, Emacs, xedit (if you're running
X-Windows), pico, joe, jed, or one of the many others.</p></li></ul></div><p>You need to get the following files (use a web
browser):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>xfmail-0.3.tar.gz
(<a href="http://Burka.NetVision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html" target="_self">Burka.NetVision.net.il/xfmail/xfmail.html</a>)</p></li><li><p>bxform-075.tgz
(<a href="http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms" target="_self">http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms/</a>)</p></li><li><p>libXpm-3.4f.tar.gz
(ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/linux/libs/)</p></li></ul></div><p>The first two links&mdash;those for xfmail-0.3.tar.gz and
bxform-075.tgz&mdash;will take you to the home pages of these impressive
programs. Read the info and follow the directions for getting the
Linux version of these programs. The last link&mdash;for the libXpm
stuff&mdash;will drop you off at one of the sunsite mirrors (that's GA
Tech, if you're curious about this). Because versions of programs
can change fairly quickly, I'll leave it up to you to get the most
recent version. I'm currently using the libXpm-3.4f.tar.gz sources.
Note that you may already have libXpm installed, in which case you
don't need to install it again.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so*
</pre><p>will tell you whether you have the library available.</p><p>In case you are curious, those files you got contain:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xfmail-0.3.tar.gz
</pre><p>The source code for the XF-Mail client version 0.3.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bxform-075.tgz
</pre><p>The binaries for the XForm toolkit libraries.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
libXpm-3.4f.tar.gz
</pre><p>The source code and precompiled libraries for the libXpm
libraries.</p><p>XF-Mail needs those last two libraries in order to be
compiled. As an additional benefit, there are lots of programs that
require the libXpm libraries, and a growing number of programs use
the XForm libraries. Having set these up once, you'll be all set
when it comes time to compile other programs that require
them.</p><p>Since I'm using Slackware 2.2.0 at the moment, my
descriptions of where things will go may be just a bit different
from yours, if you are using a different distribution. Not to
fret... I'll try to be as broad as I can in terms of describing how
to proceed.</p><p>Let's begin by setting up the libXpm libraries. If you
already have them, skip this section. If you use one of the new
ELF-based distributions, you probably already have them, but if you
don't, you will have to get ELF versions instead of the a.out ones
documented here. The procedure is the same.</p><p>Since the libXpm-3.4f.tar.gz archive contains precompiled
libraries and the necessary header files, let's use these. On my
system, I have created a /usr/local/src directory in which I store
and compile all new programs. You don't have to do this yourself,
but it does help keep things organized. Now, let me quickly take
you through the steps to set this stuff up:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mv libXpm-3.4f.tar.gz /usr/local/src/
$ cd /usr/local/src
$ tar -xvzf libXpm-3.4f.tar.gz
$ cd xpm-3.4f/
$ ls -l
</pre><p>look for libXpm.a, libXpm.sa, and libXpm.so.4.6. Now become
root, and install the files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ su <span   class="emphasis"><em>(type your root password)</em></span>
# cp libXpm.* /usr/X11R6/lib/
# cp lib/xpm*.h /usr/X11R6/include/X11/
# ldconfig
# exit
bni:Congrats! The libXpm libraries should now be installed.
Make sure you go back to being a normal user again by pressing
Ctrl-D. No point is doing something dumb as root and making
a mess of things, right?
</pre><p>Next, let's deal with bxform-075.tgz. This archive contains
the binaries (actually, the static libraries) for the XForm libs.
It's almost as easy to set up as the libXpm libs, except you'll
need to do a little bit of editing to put things where they belong.
Note that if you have an ELF-based distribution, you will need to
get the ELF version of the library, rather than the a.out
version.</p><p>We'll start the same way we did the last time:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mv bxform-075.tgz /usr/local/src
$ cd /usr/local/src
$ tar -xvzf bxform-075.tgz
$ cd xforms/
$ ls -l
</pre><p>One of the files you will notice is a README file. It's
always a good idea to read through the README files for anything,
and this is no exception. It'll inform you that the file you need
to edit in order to make any modifications is the mkconfig.h file.
It's another good idea to always make a backup copy of any file you
modify before you modify it. If things get screwed up, you should
have a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; copy to fall back on. I've called my backup copy
mkconfig.h.dist since it came with the distribution. <b  >cp
mkconfig.h mkconfig.h.dist</b> does the trick.</p><p>There are two modifications you may want to make. When you
load up the file, you should see lines a bit down the page that
look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LIB_DIR=/usr/lib
LIBMODE=644
HEADER_DIR=/usr/include
HEADERMODE=644
</pre><p>You might want to consider installing the libforms.a library
into the /usr/X11R6/lib directory, and the header file, form.h into
the /usr/X11R6/include/Xf directory, because that is where XF-Mail
will be looking for these files. If you do this now, it'll be a bit
easier during the next step. So, change the
<b  >LIB_DIR=</b> and the <b  >HEADER_DIR=</b>
lines to read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LIB_DIR=/usr/X11R6/lib
LIBMODE=644
HEADER_DIR=/usr/X11R6/include/Xf
HEADERMODE=644
</pre><p>This should put everything where it belongs.</p><p>Now, all that remains to finish the installation, after
you've saved the modifications, is to become root again, and type
in <b  >make install</b>.</p><p>You are now ready to compile XF-Mail. At this point you
merely un-archive the file, copy a file, optionally edit the
Makefile (which orchestrates the process of compiling), and compile
the program.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mv xfmail-0.3.tar.gz /usr/local/src
$ cd /usr/local/src
$ tar -xvzf xfmail-0.3.tar.gz
$ cd xfmail/ui
$ cp Makefile.Linux Makefile
At this point, there's really nothing much left to do but
compile the program. I'll add here that you can optionally
change the directories in which the program and the manual
pages are installed. Why? Well, there are a couple of schools
of thought regarding the installation of new programs. The one
that I ascribe to suggests putting all user-added programs into
the /usr/local directory.
You don't <span   class="bold"><b>need</b></span> to do this following step, but to change
the default location of the program installation from
/usr/X11R6 to /usr/local, let's take a look at the Makefile.
When you edit the Makefile you've just created, you'll see a section
near the top that looks like:
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
BINDIR = /usr/X11R6/bin
MANDIR = /usr/X11R6/man/man1
</pre><p>You'll notice that the section delimited by the <b  >#
change the following...</b> statement at the top and the
<b  ># end of user configurable settings</b> statement at
the bottom is the only section of the file that you should edit.
Also notice the lines that define the XForm include directory
(<b  >XFINC</b>) and the line for the XForm library
directory (<b  >XFLIB</b>). Now you'll see why we edited
the Makefile above for XForms: /usr/X11R6/include/Xf is where
XF-Mail will look for the form.h header file, and /usr/X11R6/lib is
where it will look for the libforms.a file.</p><p>To install the xfmail program into your /usr/local/bin
directory, and the manual pages into the /usr/local/man/man1
directory, simply edit the <b  >BINDIR</b> and the
<b  >MANDIR</b> entries:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
MANDIR = /usr/local/man/man1
</pre><p>At this point, all that's left to do is compile and install
the program. Simply enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
$ su
# make install
# exit
</pre><p>The first step will take a while, especially if you don't
have very much memory, but if the compilation has gone well you
should see no error messages. After the <b  >make
install</b> step, the program will be completely
installed.</p><p>The hardest part is done.</p><p>If you have troubles of any sort compiling XF-Mail, you can
take the easy way out. The author has Linux binaries available for
ftp at burka.netvision.net.il in /pub/xfmail/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1289580.0x177b698"></a>Configuring XF-Mail</h2></div></div><p>XF-Mail was written by a couple of guys named Gennady B.
Sorokopud and Ugen J. S. Antsilevich. In their own word:s</p><p>XF-Mail is an X-Windows application for receiving electronic
mail. It was created using XForms library toolkit by T.C. Zhao and
Mark Overmars.</p><p>It's partially compatible with MH style mailboxes but it does
not require any mh tools to be installed on the system. You can
read most of your MH folders and messages with XF-Mail.</p><p>XF-Mail has very friendly user interface and it's extremely
easy in use. It implements most of the mail functionality in one
program and it does not require any additional tools.</p><p>Guess that pretty much sums it up! It really does have a very
friendly user interface and is quite easy to use. Additionally,
while it can be set up to use sendmail, it can happily live without
it.</p><p>One of the greatest things about XF-Mail is that all the
user-configurable options are easily set using the GUI
configuration menu. This is a <span   class="bold"><b>huge</b></span>
plus, as the options in the Configuration Menu give you a great
deal of power over how the program functions and appears.</p><p>To configure XF-Mail, you simply need to start it up. Fire up
X, and in one of the xterms enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ xfmail &amp;
</pre><p>This will fire up the program. Now, depending on your
hardware and software set up, this may take a few seconds.</p><p>Parenthetically, it's not a bad idea to use an xterm to start
any program up that you've just installed. For example, you could
install a program and simply add it to a button bar or menu and
call it from there. The problem with this is that error messages
are printed if the program can't run. If you try to start a program
up from a menu or button bar, you won't necessarily see these
messages and will then be left wondering why your program won't
start. If you test drive your newly installed programs using the
command line in an xterm, you should see what's happening.</p><p>There are, fortunately, only a couple things you'll need to
know in order to get XF-Mail up and running. These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The DNS name or the IP address of the Mail Host
from which you'll get your mail</p></li><li><p>The port number or service of your Mail Host&mdash;e.g.,
<b  >pop3</b> if your Mail Host uses POP3 protocol</p></li><li><p>Your username</p></li><li><p>Your password</p></li><li><p>The DNS or IP address of your SMTP gateway or
host</p></li></ul></div><p>That's pretty much it, as far as essential information goes.
The Mail Host information is simply the host from which you get
your mail. The SMTP gateway is simply the host to which you'll send
your mail. These are usually the same host. For example, I get my
mail from the Mail Host ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu (at Vanderbilt
University). The mail server there uses POP3 protocol and I use the
same address for outgoing mail using SMTP.</p><p>If you have any questions about this information, do yourself
a <span   class="bold"><b>huge</b></span> favor and ask or call the
folks who are responsible for your mail service. If you're at a
university or large organization, there's often a help desk that
can provide you with all the information you'll need. If you have
mail service through a local ISP, they should be able to help you
as well. Essentially, you'll just need the address (either the name
or the numeric IP address) of the Mail Host and the SMTP gateway.
Since the mail server at Vanderbilt uses the POP3 (Post Office
Protocol) protocol, I use that for the &ldquo;port number&rdquo;.</p><p>To start configuration, go to the menu bar and select the
Misc menu and choose Config. You will be presented with a
Configuration Dialog box that lets you set a variety of things.
Let's first get the essentials out of the way.</p><p>To get mail into and out of your box through the mail host
and your SMTP gateway, you'll need to enter this information. From
the Configuration menu, choose POP which presents you with the POP
Configuration menu box. Here, enter the mail host (your POP server
from which you'll get your mail) in the box entitled Host. To the
right of this, in the space labelled Port, enter the port number or
service. If your mail host uses the POP3 protocol, simply leave
this as <b  >pop3</b>. If it's something else, you should
check with the postmaster at your mail service and make sure you
know which service/port they use.</p><p>Below this, enter your username and your password. Also,
check the option buttons if you wish to leave your mail on the mail
server and if you want XF-Mail to store your password in the
configuration file so that you won't be prompted for it each time
you attempt to get mail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1289580.0x177c1f0"></a>A Couple Caveats:</h2></div></div><p>This, and the section on setting up the SMTP gateway
information, are the most critical aspects of configuring your mail
client. If you enter an incorrect address for the mail host or the
port number, you won't be able to get mail. Second, keep in mind
that storing your password, while very convenient, is also
<span   class="bold"><b>very insecure</b></span>, since the password
is stored in your ~/.xfmailrc file un-encrypted. If you're the only
one using your system, this is not a real problem, but if others
have access to your system, be aware that your password is quite
vulnerable. Finally, as a precaution, at least at first you
probably should <span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> delete your
mail from the pop server. That way, if anything goes wrong, you'll
at least have a copy of your mail on the mail server and should be
able to retrieve it again later. If something goes wrong and your
mail has been deleted from the server, it's
<span   class="bold"><b>gone</b></span>.</p><p>Did I scare you? I hope not; just be prudent and use your
common sense. Keep in mind that this program is still in beta
testing, and while it has undergone a lot of testing and debugging
so far, it is likely to have a few &ldquo;undocumented features&rdquo; left.
Play it safe.</p><p>Lastly, let's set up the outgoing mail. Press the Done button
after you've entered all the info for the POP Configuration, and
then presss the Send button, which will allow you to set up the
SMTP information. In the first box, entitled &ldquo;SMTP Host&rdquo;, enter
the name or IP address of your SMTP gateway and then the SMTP port
number in the box to the right of this. The default for the port is
<b  >smtp</b>, which is an Internet standard.</p><p>If you have installed the sendmail program, you can also fill
in its location, but it's not necessary.</p><p>To have XF-Mail use the built-in SMTP support, click on the
<b  >use SMTP</b> button. A couple other suggestions and
we're almost done. First, I recommend that you also check the
&ldquo;Save to <span   class="bold"><b>sent mail</b></span>&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Offline send&rdquo; options. The first will save a copy of all your
outgoing mail. Why would you want to do that? Good question.</p><p>Mail on the Internet <span   class="bold"><b>can</b></span> get
lost. Machines crash, hard drives fail, mail delivery programs have
bugs. If you save copies of outgoing mail, you can re-send mail if
you find it never made it to its destination.</p><p>Setting the Offline send option allows you to compose mail
and set it up to be sent out, even when you're not
connected!</p><p>We're almost done. (Have I said that before?) Press the Done
button and when you're back at the Configuration dialog box, press
the Save button.</p><p>Now, there's just one more thing that you probably should do.
Press the Misc button in the Configuration dialog box. This
presents you with a list of various options. At the bottom, click
on the Open log on startup option. This will log all messages to a
&ldquo;Log Window&rdquo; which will allow you to see what's happening. Keep
an eye on this, especially the first couple times you try to
retrieve mail from the server and send mail to the SMTP gateway.
Now, to save your changes, press Save once again and you're
done.</p><p>You'll need to get your SLIP, CSLIP, or PPP connection up and
running first. Once it's up, fire up XF-Mail and then go to the
<span   class="bold"><b>Misc</b></span> menu and choose
<span   class="bold"><b>Retrieve mail</b></span>. Keep an eye on the
action that's going on in the <span   class="bold"><b>Log
Window</b></span>. This should let you know if everything's set up
correctly and XF-Mail was able to make connection with your mail
host.</p><p>No mail? No problem. Send yourself some!</p><p>Up at the top of the screen, click on the
<span   class="bold"><b>pen</b></span> icon on the toolbar. The
astute user will notice that moving the cursor onto the icon causes
a short description to be printed along the status line at the
bottom of the window. Very handy. Now, click on that and you'll be
presented with an edit window. Now, it's just a matter of filling
in the blanks. At the top of the window you can enter the
information for the <b  >From:</b>,
<b  >Subject:</b>, and <b  >To:</b>
fields.</p><p>Now, type in a short test message and when you're done, press
the <span   class="bold"><b>letter</b></span> icon on the top left.
If you get an error message about needing to specify at least one
recipient, don't forget to press the RETURN key after you've filled
in the name of the recipient. If this was done correctly, you'll
see the entry move to the box below. You could also use your shiny
new <span   class="bold"><b>Address Book</b></span>. Press the
<span   class="bold"><b>Address</b></span> button and the address
book fires up. Enter the name on the entry line and press the Save
button. Click on the <span   class="bold"><b>To</b></span> button and
press RETURN. Done.</p><p>Almost. Remember that we've set up offline send. To get the
message out, you'll need to choose the
<span   class="bold"><b>Send</b></span> menu item, and then click on
the <span   class="bold"><b>Send all</b></span> item. If you have an
external modem, you should see the lights lighting up and the log
window should let you know the progress of things. If all went
well, you should now have new mail! Go back and retrieve it to see
if things are working okay.</p><p>Now, let's do just a couple other things before finishing up
here. First, there are several things that you'll want to set up.
You don't have to, but it'll make using XF-Mail a lot easier and
more fun.</p><p>The things you'll probably want to do at this point
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Set up an external editor</p></li><li><p>Set up an external message viewer</p></li><li><p>Configure the <b  >From:</b> field for
outgoing messages</p></li><li><p>Decide whether you want to additionally retrieve
mail from a local mail spool</p></li><li><p>Edit your .signature file if you haven't
already</p></li></ul></div><p>You'll want to set up an external editor and viewer because
the built-in editor and viewer are quite limited and can handle
messages only 30 lines or fewer long. That's not much. However, you
can set up any X editor as your viewer/editor. Keep in mind,
however, that you probably don't want to use something rather huge,
like Xemacs. Granted, this is a great editor, but you'll be able to
do three week's worth of wash <span   class="bold"><b>and</b></span>
iron all your socks before it'll finish loading. I initially used
xedit, which is admittedly a bit Spartan, but at least it loaded up
fast. I'm currently using aXe, which loads up quite nicely but is a
<span   class="bold"><b>lot</b></span> more functional.</p><p>So, to set these things up, call the Configuration menu up
once again:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the View menu to set up the external viewer.
Just enter the command necessary to fire up your
editor/viewer&mdash;just as you would in an xterm. For example, I'm
using the xedit program as my external viewer still. I simply enter
<b  >/usr/X11R6/bin/xedit</b> in the box and then set the
number of lines to whatever I want, such as 75.</p></li><li><p>Use the Edit menu to set up the external editor.
Once again, enter the command line necessary to load up your chosen
editor. For example, to use the aXe editor, I've entered:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/bin/axe -noserver -geometry 74x40+55+0
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use the <span   class="bold"><b>Misc</b></span> menu
to set up the <b  >From:</b> field. (You'll need to do
this in order to correctly set this for outgoing mail.) Remember
that most folks who want to write you back simply press the
<span   class="bold"><b>reply</b></span> button and so your
<b  >From:</b> field is important in order to get the
correct address. Enter your e-mail address on the
<b  >From:</b> field line.</p></li><li><p>Use the Receive menu to optionally retrieve mail
from a local spool. Enter the directory where your mail spool
exists. For example, since I spend most of my time as root, my mail
spool directory is /var/spool/mail/root. I have this set up for
<span   class="bold"><b>both</b></span> spool and POP retrieval
because I often use the program popclient to retrieve my mail when
I'm not running X or when I'm using a background shell program to
periodically check my mail. I have popclient set up to deposit mail
into my local mail spool directory and so XF-Mail will dutifully
pick it up from there as well as from the POP server.</p></li></ul></div><p>After making these changes, don't forget to press the Save
button to save them.</p><p>To edit your .signature file, select the Misc menu once again
and click on the Signature item. There's an easy-to-use signature
editor that pops up and lets you create your .signature file and
save it. I found that you cannot use the entire window for your
.signature file. If you do, you'll get an error message about the
signature being too large. You'll have to keep it to about 8 to 10
lines. Play with it and see for yourself. Internet etiquette has
suggested a maximum of 4 lines for a long time, so you may wish to
limit yourself to 4 to make the rest of the world happy.</p><p>Keep in mind that there are
<span   class="bold"><b>lots</b></span> of nifty configuration
options and features left to play with. Let me recommend to you
that you skim through the online help system. Just choose Help from
the menu bar and choose the Contents item. It will display a help
window with all kinds of useful information describing what you can
do with this great program. It's time to explore!</p><p>Want more? It's easy to join the XF-Mail mailing list: simply
