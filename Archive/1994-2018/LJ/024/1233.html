    If you want or need some sort of connection to the Internet,
    but aren't sure what sort of connection, or where or how to
    connect, this article will answer some of your questions,
    and help you learn how to ask for answers to the rest.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3e558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over a year ago, we ran a story about
looking for an <span   class="bold"><b>I</b></span>nternet
<span   class="bold"><b>S</b></span>ervice
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>rovider. Since then, the Internet
has exploded in popularity, and the ISP scene has changed
drastically. A PPP or SLIP connection is no longer considered a
premium service for which you can expect to pay $100, or likely
more, per month; now it is a basic service available in many areas
for $20 per month or less. Many new ISPs have started up, and quite
a few have gone out of business. More ISPs are available on a
national scale. The &ldquo;On-line Services&rdquo; of the 80s are now
connected to the Internet in one way or another. Your choices have
expanded; so has your need for information about those choices.
</p><p>If you want to know the difference between a BBS, an on-line
service, a shell account, and a PPP or SLIP account, this article
will tell you what you need to know (and perhaps more than you want
to know). If you are worried about the relative dangers of
connecting your computer to the outside world in different ways, a
comparison follows. At the end, you will find some advice&mdash;a
buyers' guide, if you will&mdash;that will help you choose between the
ISPs in your area.</p><p>This article may initially put you into acronym overload.
Acronyms are in such wide use in the Internet community that this
is impossible to avoid. However, the acronyms are explained in the
article, helping you speak the Internet language.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc3e818"></a>Capabilities and Limitations</h2></div></div><p>For many years, people have operated
<span   class="bold"><b>BBS</b></span>'s (Bulletin Board Systems)
from their homes, and some BBSs have become so large that they have
become businesses in their own right. Almost every BBS arranges for
e-mail among its own users, and many BBSs have been connected to a
world-wide mail (and file) exchange network called FIDO. In FIDO,
e-mail and files are passed from node (a single BBS) to node via
telephone connections until they reach their final
destination.</p><p>With this history of communication, it is not surprising that
many BBSs chose to provide Internet e-mail as well. Some of them
use a protocol developed for Unix, called
<span   class="bold"><b>UUCP</b></span> (Unix to Unix CoPy), which
works much like FIDO, and others use a direct IP (Internet
Protocol) connection to the Internet, which can support telnet,
ftp, and WWW connections as well as e-mail. Those BBSs that are
connected with UUCP or direct IP usually provide Usenet news as
well as Internet e-mail; those that have a direct IP connection
usually support some Internet services as well.</p><p>Most BBSs have some sort of specialty, whether it's on-line
games with other users, archives of some kind of programs,
graphics, or discussions on one subject or another. More and more,
they are also providing general Internet services like telnet, ftp,
gopher, and WWW. Some allow you to call in using telnet from some
other Internet site as well as through their own modems.</p><p>Most BBS systems provide you with menus which guide you
through the provided services. The SysOp (System Operator)
constructs the menus, determines which users have what privileges,
and generally runs the show. Some large BBSs have multiple
SysOps.</p><p>Most BBSs have very limited numbers of modems and phone
lines, and therefore place significant limits on the amount of time
a user can spend on line. Users are often granted extra time for
doing things that are beneficial to the BBS, whether that's
uploading a file, contributing to on-line discussion, donating
money or equipment, or being the SysOp's friend. Some BBSs require
you to pay for your time, but many operate on a donation or even
free basis.</p><p>For years, the large-scale national and world-wide
counterparts to BBSs have been the &ldquo;<span   class="bold"><b>On-line
Services</b></span>&rdquo; such as Compuserve, Prodigy, America On-line,
Genie, Bix, etc. While most of them originally started with menu
structures much like those of a BBS, more and more have been
requiring that the user run specialized software, most of which
isn't available for Linux. You may be able to use DOSEMU to run DOS
software, for example, but it is entirely possible that it will be
easiest for you to reboot into DOS/Windows to connect.</p><p>Fortunately for Linux users, more and more of the on-line
services have started to provide serial IP connections, which Linux
handles natively, so specialized programs are not required. (See
below for more on serial IP.)</p><p>Most of these services use large networks of modems all over
the country or even world, which are often owned by some other
company. Therefore, you may be charged several different fees for
one connection: a fee for the time spent using the service and a
fee for the same time spent using the modem, not to mention any
long-distance fees that you need to pay to get to the modem.</p><p>Several of the on-line services have had a history of
censorship of one form or another. Some even censor the private
e-mail of their users. If this bothers you, ask about censorship
before joining any service.</p><p>If you are comfortable with the command-line interface that
Linux provides, you will probably be comfortable with a
<span   class="bold"><b>Shell account</b></span> on a Linux or Unix
computer managed by an ISP. Once your modem connects to the other
modem and you log in, it is the same as an xterm session or a
console login (without graphics capabilities) on your Linux box,
except that the remote computer you are logged into is connected to
the Internet. You usually use a standard Unix shell, with roughly
the same choices available on your own Linux system, although some
shell accounts also provide an optional menu interface similar to
what a BBS provides.</p><p>In most cases, you are allowed to compile and run your own
programs, if you wish. There is almost always a much larger
selection of programs and services available than on a BBS. In
addition, since you are connected to the Internet, all the services
on the Internet are also available to you.</p><p>Unlike most BBSs and on-line services, you usually get to
choose which program you wish to use to read mail and news. Pine,
Elm, MH, mush, emacs-rmail, mailx, and other mail readers may all
be available for you. You are likely to have your choice of rn,
tin, trn, slrn, nn, and other news readers. Again, if you need to
edit a file, you are likely to have your choice of editors. Emacs,
vi, jed, and pico are common offerings.</p><p>If you want to browse the World-Wide Web, the text-based
browser <span   class="bold"><b>lynx</b></span> will almost certainly
be available.</p><p>A strong contrast to all the previous options, serial IP
makes your machine a part of the Internet. For instance, instead of
using ftp to transfer a file from a remote site on the Internet to
your ISP's computer, and then using kermit or z-modem to transfer
the file to your own computer, serial IP allows you to ftp the file
straight from the remote site to your own computer, without storing
the file somewhere as an intermediary step.</p><p>There are two kinds of serial IP in common use. The older,
less advanced, less standard kind is called
<span   class="bold"><b>SLIP</b></span>, which stands for
<span   class="bold"><b>S</b></span>erial
<span   class="bold"><b>L</b></span>ink
<span   class="bold"><b>I</b></span>nternet
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>rotocol. The newer, standardized,
easier to configure kind is called
<span   class="bold"><b>PPP</b></span>, which stands for
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>oint to
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>oint
<span   class="bold"><b>P</b></span>rotocol. PPP is designed to
correct the flaws that were discovered in SLIP after it was
designed. Linux supports both SLIP and PPP.</p><p>Besides the choice between SLIP and PPP, you may also have a
choice between <span   class="emphasis"><em>static</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dynamic</em></span> addressing. In order to understand
this choice, you need to know something about the Internet. Each
computer on the Internet is assigned its own unique number, which
is called its <span   class="bold"><b>IP number</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>IP address</b></span>. No two computers on
the Internet should be assigned the same address. When you
configure your serial IP connection, one of the most important
parameters is your IP address. So how do you get an IP
address?</p><p>Each ISP has a large group of addresses that they parcel out
one by one to their customers, and your ISP provides you with your
address. There are two basic ways they go about doing this. One is
to give you an IP address that is assigned just to you. In this
case, called <span   class="bold"><b>static addressing</b></span>,
you will always have the same address. The other way is for them to
tell you what your IP address is when you connect. In this case,
called <span   class="bold"><b>dynamic addressing</b></span>, that
address is likely to change each time you log in.</p><p>In the same way, not only will your address (a set of four
numbers like 10.24.105.27) change each time you connect with
dynamic addressing, but your Internet hostname will change, too.
Even if you have named your Linux system &ldquo;ralph&rdquo;, your Internet
hostname might be dial12.city.isp.com one time and
dial34.city.isp.com the next day. By contrast, with static
addressing, you can nearly always get a reasonable Internet name
such as ralph.isp.com.</p><p>From the standpoint of using common Internet tools like ftp,
telnet, and WWW browsers, both static and dynamic addressing should
act identically. However, from the standpoint of receiving e-mail,
they have different potential. While you can get e-mail from both
kinds of serial IP connections, only a static address and name
allows you to create as many mailboxes as you like:
me@ralph.isp.com, myfriend@ralph.isp.com, mywife@ralph.isp.com,
myson@ralph.isp.com, and so on. By comparison, a dynamic address
usually allows only one mailbox (usually something like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourname</em></span>@isp.com), and you are not able to add
new mailboxes on your own.</p><p>On the other hand, serial IP connections with dynamic
addresses often cost less, and if you don't need the extra
functionality, there is a certain amount of (almost) anonymity
retained by not having the same Internet address each time you
connect. Furthermore, setting up your own mailboxes (as is possible
only with a static address) requires learning how to manage an
<span   class="bold"><b>MTA</b></span> (mail transport agent) such as
<span   class="bold"><b>sendmail</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>smail</b></span>, which is not simple to do
correctly. Even the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrator's
Guide</em></span> gives only simple introductions to configuring
these two. By contrast, the &ldquo;popmail&rdquo; connections usually used
for reading mail in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>yourname</em></span>@isp.com style
of mailboxes are almost automatic to use if you are using a mail
reader that supports popmail&mdash;and most do.</p><p>Either kind of serial IP account should let you browse Usenet
news from home, using the <span   class="bold"><b>NNTP</b></span>
(Network News Transport Protocol). However, this can be rather
slow, depending on which news reader you use. The
<span   class="bold"><b>xrn</b></span> (X-Windows based) and
<span   class="bold"><b>slrn</b></span> (text-based) newsreaders are
some of the few newsreaders which are still reasonably fast for
reading news across a serial IP connection.</p><p>If you want users of other computers to be able to connect to
your computer, serial IP is the way to do it. In particular, a
static address and name will make this easy.</p><p>If you have a shell account, but want to use a graphical WWW
browser such as Mosaic or Netscape, one option is to use a
&ldquo;<span   class="bold"><b>fake IP</b></span>&rdquo; program such as SLiRP
or TIA. These are programs that you run on your ISP's computer
which talk to your computer using PPP or SLIP, convincing your
computer that it is really part of the Internet. With these
programs, you can ftp to a remote computer&mdash;but the remote computer
talks to your ISP's computer, and the fake IP program acts as a
&ldquo;relay&rdquo; for the connection.</p><p>This allows you to run multiple programs at the same time
over the link, just like real serial IP. It allows you to be
connected to the Internet. However, it does not allow others to
connect from the Internet to your computer unless you explicitly
allow it, which makes it a bit safer than a real serial IP
connection if you don't pay close attention to security on your
system.</p><p>It also has all the limitations of serial IP with dynamically
assigned addresses and names, but in addition to those, it is not
possible to run programs that use UDP, the User Datagram Protocol,
across the link. The most common program that uses UDP is probably
<span   class="bold"><b>talk</b></span>. In these cases, you normally
telnet to another machine (probably the machine that you are
running SLiRP or TIA on) and run the program from there.</p><p>Popmail and other services commonly available with serial IP
services may be available over a fake IP connection, depending on
your ISP.</p><p>Some ISPs prohibit the use of fake IP programs, on the
grounds that you shouldn't need to do that if you have a real
serial IP available, and that if you want IP, you ought to be
paying for a real serial IP connection.</p><p>If a modem isn't fast enough for you, there are other kinds
of connections. ISDN, Leased Line, and Frame Relay products are all
available for Linux. However, these are expensive, and the
capabilities are changing rapidly. Each would require an entire
article to introduce its details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc365a0"></a>Dangers</h2></div></div><p>With a BBS, shell account, or on-line service, the dangers
are small and minimal. The worst danger (possible with any service,
of course) is probably a lightning strike that damages your modem,
and possibly your computer. If you download programs directly from
the service involved, you may need to think about viruses (none are
known on Linux) or Trojan Horses, programs which claim to do one
thing and really do another. If you consider censorship a danger,
you are most likely to find it in various forms on the on-line
services.</p><p>With fake IP, the dangers are also rather minimal, but the
danger of a remote user breaking into your computer, while remote,
now exists. Someone using the same ISP may be able to log into your
computer if you don't pay attention to basic security, such as
having good passwords for your accounts.</p><p>With serial IP, the dangers are very real. Unlike single-user
program loaders like DOS and Windows, Linux is designed to function
across the network. This power brings the potential for break-ins
if security is not maintained. And in order to manage that power,
it is best to know a little bit about what you are doing. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Administrator's Guide</em></span> (The
<span   class="bold"><b>NAG</b></span>) tells you all you need to
know to understand how to maintain your network, so have a copy
handy.</p><p>Of course, you need to maintain good passwords&mdash;that should
go without saying. Don't run unnecessary services. Read the
/etc/inetd.conf file and comment out (by inserting a
<b  >#</b> character at the beginning of the line)
services that you don't need. If you don't want anyone to be able
to use telnet to connect to your machine, comment out the line that
starts telnetd. If you are confused, read the NAG.</p><p>Make sure that you have a file called /etc/securetty. The
securetty file controls which terminals root is allowed to log in
on, and allowing root logins over the network is a good way to
invite break-ins. Make sure that it does not contain any lines
starting with <b  >ttyp</b>--these are the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pseudo-ttys</em></span> that are used for network
logins.</p><p>Pay attention to security alerts. Security holes in Linux or
Linux distributions are announced on the comp.os.linux.announce
newsgroup. Read these announcements and act on them. They contain
careful, easy-to-follow instructions on how to close the security
hole in question. If you have PGP installed, use it to ascertain
that the announcement is genuine before following the
instructions.</p><p>If you have reason to be even more careful about security,
take time to learn about authorization (<b  >man
tcpd</b>) and firewall software&mdash;there are several articles
in this issue on that topic.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc36ac8"></a>Competition</h2></div></div><p>Pricing structures may have nothing to do with reality. If
prices seem too low to believe, they may well be. How much trouble
would it be to switch your e-mail to another site if your current
provider goes out of business? What about your web site or your
home page? Many ISPs have gone out of business in the last year,
and the trend doesn't appear to be slowing down yet.</p><p>Do you want a local ISP or a national one? There are
advantages to both; some people keep two accounts, one local and
one national. If your ISP is near you, they will be easier to find.
They may know more about people at the local phone company office
and know who to talk to to get things done (or fixed) at a local
level. By contrast, a national ISP has sites all around the nation
that you can call in to, and by being bigger businesses, they may
have more resources to provide the right distribution of equipment
to meet all their users needs.</p><p>You need to decide what level of service you want, and be
willing to pay for what you need. If your business depends on your
connection, you probably don't want to go with a fly-by-night
operation that may or may not be around next week, and may not have
as much experience. If you just want to &ldquo;surf the net&rdquo; and can
deal with trouble or switching providers if necessary, you are
likely to be able to pay less&mdash;just don't expect the same level of
service from all providers, regardless of price.</p><p>Also, it's important to understand that there are some things
that the ISP can fix, and some things that the ISP can't fix any
more than you can. The ISP can provide enough modems that you don't
get a busy signal too often, and the ISP should be able to respond
as quickly to emergency phone calls as they promise to, however
quickly that is. The ISP can't, however, fix the rest of the
Internet if their own connection to the Internet is broken by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> provider, or make the phone company fix
broken phone equipment on your schedule.</p><p>The Internet is constantly under construction. Choosing an
ISP with multiple connections to the Internet through different
providers makes it less likely that your ISP will temporarily loose
Internet connectivity through no fault of their own. If your
business depends on reliable connections to many different parts of
the Internet, choose an ISP with two or three connections to major
Internet providers, such as MCI, Sprint, PSI, or ANS.</p><p>Troubles will occur. Every ISP has troubles from time to
time. You may have the choice of bouncing from one ISP to another.
Our recommendation is to stick with one ISP as long as you can,
especially if you choose a local ISP, because they can be extra
helpful to people they know.</p><p>If you absolutely, positively need Internet access all the
time, consider keeping a backup account at a different ISP. If you
do this, make sure that the backup account is connected to the
Internet in a different way than your main ISP. It may even be
worth making a long-distance call in an emergency, depending on
your need.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb46580.0xc36e38"></a>Speaking Their Language</h2></div></div><p>The vocabulary covered in this article will help you speak
your ISP's language. While many ISPs try to speak real English,
knowing the occasional technical term can be very helpful, both in
choosing an ISP and in working with your ISP once your choice is
made.</p><p>You may know, or you may have learned in this article, more
vocabulary than the help desk or sales staff know. If you sense
that the person on the other end of the phone doesn't know what you
are talking about, don't be afraid to ask to talk to technical
staff.</p><p>See <a href="1233s1.html" target="_self">Internet Resources</a>
