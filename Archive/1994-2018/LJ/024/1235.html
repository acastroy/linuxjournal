<i  >LJ</i>, please help push further development of
Arena. Netscape is huge, slow, and our only option. I now use Lynx
for almost all my browsing because Netscape is so slow on my
system. Arena runs well, but cannot handle forms, one of the most
functional features of a web browser. Like many people, I am not
interested in background patterns and enhanced fonts. I want easy
access to information, which I am unable to get with Netscape or
the current Arena.</p><p>&mdash;Peter McArthur

of the browser selection available at this point. In December, I
was at the 4th International World Wide Web conference in Boston,
and a group of us started talking, and decided it was time to start
a Free Browser project, modeled on the Linux community, to address
exactly this problem. We are putting a mildly cohesive framework
together before &ldquo;going public&rdquo; but your input is certainly
appreciated. The Linux community has much to offer this project,
and I think we can definitely build a better mousetrap. A mailing
list has been set up. See

(<i  >LJ</i> #21) was an excellent introduction to the
sometimes counterintuitive file and directory permissions of
Unix-like operating systems. Near the end, however, there is a
misstatement concerning the &ldquo;sticky bit&rdquo;. This bit actually has a
very important, though obscure, use on Linux systems.</p><p>The sticky bit got its name on early Unix systems in the days
before demand-paged virtual memory. If the sticky bit of an
executable file was set, after the program exited a copy of its
text segment was saved in the system's swap area, i.e., it would
&ldquo;stick around&rdquo; for the next use. This feature was used to make
frequently-run programs load a little bit faster. This meaning of
the sticky bit is no longer particularly relevant.</p><p>Although it is not a part of the POSIX specification, recent
System V and Berkeley Unix systems defined a new meaning for the
sticky bit. If a directory's sticky bit is set, a file in the
directory may be deleted only by the file's owner, by the
directory's owner, or by root. This provides an additional measure
of security for directories such as /tmp. Linux, of course,
supports this useful feature. For example, on my system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt  3 root   root   1024 Jan  1 09:49 /tmp
$ ls -l /tmp
-rw-------  1 roman  users     0 Jan  1 09:49 bar
-rw-------  1 root   root      0 Jan  1 09:47 foo
$ rm /tmp/bar
$ rm /tmp/foo
rm: /tmp/foo: Operation not permitted
</pre><p>Without the sticky bit, I would have been able to remove
root's file from /tmp.

It should never have passed through editing.</em></span></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d0580.0x27c8ad8"></a>Things have changed</h2></div></div><p>I read your article on LISP-Stat last August with much
interest, and have just got around to trying it out. One
inconsistency: the article claims that the &ldquo;dld&rdquo; library is
essential. This is not true; if you build Lisp-Stat from scratch,
it will use the now-standard &ldquo;dlopen&rdquo; method for dynamic loading
(based on the ld.so library) if it is present. In fact, &ldquo;dld&rdquo; no
longer seems to work with current &ldquo;a.out&rdquo; style static libraries,
let alone ELF libraries.</p><p>I compiled the thing for ELF using gcc 2.7.0 and everything
worked just great. The compile time is rather long (about an hour
on a 486-33 with 20M memory), especially since a lot of the code is
in LISP. All of the book examples worked perfectly. A marvellous
way to review long-forgotten stats material.</p><p>You are doing an excellent job at presenting intriguing
applications for Linux. Please keep up the great work!</p><p>&mdash;Rod Hallsworth

ELF was still somewhat experimental and since we didn't know when
it would be considered generally stable, we chose not to base
articles on the assumption that it would become stable between the
time the article was written and read. We have since started
recommending that people switch to ELF when it is reasonably
possible for them to do so, since it is now considered stable, and
since the time will come (and obviously already is, to some extent)
when applications are only available in ELF. Thanks for pointing
out that it builds without a problem with ELF.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d0580.0x27c8e48"></a>Picky Python</h2></div></div><p>I found the Python examples largely worthless because of
errors. Line 6 of the program listed on page 21 should read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
uid = `posix.getuid()`
</pre><p>Notice the (<b  >`</b>) rather than
(<b  >'</b>).
</p><p>The largest problem was the format of the
<b  >StackingThings</b> program listed on page 23. Python
is <span   class="bold"><b>VERY</b></span> sensitive to indentation.
The attempt to format the program to fit the column &ldquo;broke it real
bad&rdquo;.</p><p>Prior remarks aside, I found the Python article enjoyable and
I am very pleased with your publication. Keep up the good
work.</p><p>&mdash;Joe Kirby

in the courier font, which is suboptimal, but for which we are hard
pressed to find a better replacement. If you look very, very
carefully, you can see that the &ldquo;backticks&rdquo; are wider at the
bottom than the top, and the &ldquo;ticks&rdquo; are wider at the top than
the bottom. We agree that you shouldn't have to look closely to see
the difference, and we are working on a solution.</p><p>Our production team did indeed break the indentation in the
<b  >StackingThings</b> example, and we apologize. The
production team at <i  >LJ</i> usually does a very good job making things
fit, but this time there were some significant slips...</p><p>The correct version of the StackingThings example can be
