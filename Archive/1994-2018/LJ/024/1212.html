    Learn about the three types of firewalls&mdash;application proxy
    gateway, circuit level relay, and packet filter&mdash;and how
    they are used to protect your network from unauthorized
    access.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x2645500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The growth of the Internet has prompted
many organizations to become security-conscious. Documented and
undocumented incidents of security violations, expanded research
about security issues, and even media hype have brought about the
potential for at least partial solutions for securing a networked
environment&mdash;without completely isolating the network from the
outside world. Leading the pack of solutions is the firewall. Just
about everyone has defined what a firewall is, so I won't be any
different. A firewall is a device or collection of devices that
restricts the access of &ldquo;outside&rdquo; networks to &ldquo;inside&rdquo;
networks. Not surprisingly, Linux can play a part in this arena.
</p><p>There are currently three models used to classify firewalls.
Fundamentally, the current industry classifications are application
proxy gateway, circuit level relay, and packet filter.</p><p>An application proxy gateway is what most people think of
when they talk about firewalls. Also known as a bastion host, it is
used to completely sever the connectivity between outside and
inside networks. Connections are made via proxy processes to the
bastion host. The bastion host in turn will establish a connection
to the real destination and handle communications between the two
connections.</p><p>There are several advantages to a proxy gateway. First,
because the proxies are at the application level, they can take
advantage of application protocols. For example, protocols
providing authentication&mdash;such as TELNET, FTP, and HTTP&mdash;can be
intercepted at the proxy and stronger authentication mechanisms
applied (such as S/Key) without adversely affecting the remote
client. Also, protocol-specific rules can be applied by the proxy.
A rule can be established that allows FTP <b  >GET</b>s
through the gateway, but not FTP <b  >PUT</b>s. Another
advantage is the extensive logging that can be provided at the
application level. It is important to note that the bastion
performs no IP routing functions. All communications are through
proxy processes. The firewall toolkit
<span   class="bold"><b>FWTK</b></span>, available as freeware from
TIS, is an example of a firewall application level gateway.</p><p>A circuit-level relay functions in a manner similar to an
application proxy gateway, except the proxies employed for a
circuit relay are normally not application-aware. Because of this,
you lose many of the detailed logging capabilities and precise rule
definitions you have in an application proxy gateway. The important
concept remains the same in that a connection is established via
proxies and IP packets are not forwarded through the firewall.
<span   class="bold"><b>SOCKS</b></span> is an implementation of a
circuit level relay based firewall.</p><p>Packet filtering is the most common type of firewall
available. It works on the concept of forwarding packets based on
rules. Those rules typically take into consideration source and
destination IP address, source and destination port numbers, the
protocol being transported, TCP flags, IP flags or options, and
other information, such as the interface, over which the packet
arrived. The primary difference between a packet filtering firewall
and the others is IP forwarding. A packet filtering firewall is
usually a router, and its function in life is to forward packets.
This means that while you can control what machines on the outside
can talk to certain machines on the inside (and which
applications), you now rely on the application to protect itself
from harm. For some applications, this isn't a particularly wise
decision. Nonetheless, packet filtering can be very useful, is
widely available and typically inexpensive.</p><p>A Linux machine can function as any one or as all three
(i.e., as a hybrid) of these firewall types) of the firewall types.
Without add-ons however, the Linux kernel has the ability to
function as a packet filter routing device, using the ipfirewall
code written by Daniel Boulet and Ugen J.S. Antsilevich. For most
1.2.x and 1.3.x kernels, the firewall code (ip_fw.c) is based on
the port by Alan Cox and Jos Vos. Boulet has released version 2.0e
(as of this writing) of his ipfirewall code as shareware. I have
yet to install the new release, so any discussion I have is based
on the ip_fw.c code&mdash;specifically kernel 1.2.13.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x2645978"></a>Caution</h2></div></div><p>In order to use this built-in firewall capability, you need
to understand a bit about how TCP/IP works. Trying to set up a
firewall from scratch without understanding networking is a sure
route to disaster. If you want a &ldquo;plug and play&rdquo; firewall
solution for Linux, one is mentioned at the end of this article. To
learn more about TCP and IP, recommended reading is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1</em></span> by W. Richard
Stevens. Also, the 3rd edition of Douglas Comer's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Internetworking with TCP/IP</em></span> is excellent
bedtime reading.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x2645b30"></a>How It's Done</h2></div></div><p>The firewall code includes three facilities&mdash;accounting,
blocking, and forwarding. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Accounting</em></span> rules are
used for maintaining packet and byte count statistics for selected
IP traffic. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blocking</em></span> rules specify rules for
accepting and rejecting packets to and from the firewall itself.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Forwarding</em></span> rules specify which packets will be
forwarded by the firewall; this implies a source and destination
address of something other than the firewall. You can specify any
type of rule based on source and/or destination IP addresses; TCP
or UDP ports; protocols such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP; or by
combinations of the three.</p><p>The services are activated when the kernel boots, and the
rules are set and modified with the
<b  >setsockopt(2)</b> system call. The current
accounting statistics and firewall rules can be viewed by looking
at the files ip_acct, ip_block, and ip_forward in the /proc/net
directory. The contents of ip_acct look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># cat /proc/net/ip_acct</b></span>
IP accounting rules
C0A80101/FFFFFFFF-&gt;00000000/00000000 00000000
 0 0 0 386 392946 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
</pre><p>In this example, one rule is present, which basically says to
keep statistics on connections from 192.168.1.1 to anywhere for all
ports and all protocols.</p><p>Changing the accounting and firewall facilities has to be
done via a C program, Perl script, or some other language that
supports the <b  >setsockopt(2)</b> system call. Here is
a sample program that will change the default policy for the
forwarding rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># cat set_policy.c</b></span>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/ip.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/tcp.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/udp.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/ip_fw.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int    p, sfd;
  struct ip_fw fw;

  fw.fw_flg = 0;

  if (strcmp(argv[1], "accept") == 0) {
    p = IP_FW_F_ACCEPT;
  }
  else if (strcmp(argv[1], "reject") == 0) {
    p = IP_FW_F_ICMPRPL;
  }
  else if (strcmp(argv[1], "deny") == 0) {
    p = 0;
  }

  sfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW);
  setsockopt(sfd, IPPROTO_IP, IP_FW_POLICY_FWD,
             &amp;p, sizeof(int));
}

<span   class="bold"><b># cat /proc/net/ip_forward</b></span>
IP firewall forward rules, default <span   class="bold"><b>4</b></span>

<span   class="bold"><b># set_policy deny</b></span>

<span   class="bold"><b># cat /proc/net/ip_forward</b></span>
IP firewall forward rules, default <span   class="bold"><b>0</b></span>
</pre><p>As you can see, it is just a matter of opening up a raw IP
socket and using <b  >setsockopt()</b> to change the
environment. The setsockopt call is setting the default policy for
the forwarding rules (<b  >IP_FW_POLICY_FWD</b>). The
value for the forward policy command is kept in
<b  >p</b> and determined by the command-line arguments
<b  >accept</b>, <b  >reject</b>, and
<b  >deny</b>. The words are equated to the defined
values of <b  >IP_FW_F_ACCEPT</b>,
<b  >IP_FW_F_ICMPRPL</b>, and <b  >0</b>. The
difference between deny and reject is that the deny policy will
just throw packets away, while the reject policy will throw packets
away, and also respond with an &ldquo;ICMP port unreachable&rdquo; message to
the originating host.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x2646580"></a>Don't Reinvent The Wheel</h2></div></div><p>Writing the C or Perl code to manipulate firewall rules may
sound like a lot of fun, but some administrators may not have the
time to roll their own firewall interface.
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfw</b></span> is a utility in the net-tools
(version 1.3.6) package that will allow the root user to add,
delete, or list information dealing with the accounting and
firewall rules. <a href="1212f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows the
output of the blocking rules in the current host.</p><p>Obviously, this is a lot better than looking at the direct
contents of the /proc/net/ip_block file. The <b  >-n</b>
option just tells ipfw not to resolve addresses to names.</p><p>Adding a rule is done quite easily. Let's say we wanted to
accept SNMP queries from a remote management station (note that the
author does not really advocate this kind of behavior&mdash;this is
just an example). We could add the rule:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# <span   class="bold"><b>ipfw add b accept udp from 0.0.0.0/0 \
  to 20.2.51.105 161</b></span>
</pre><p>to give us the new list shown in
<a href="1212f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a>.
</p><p>Before we move on, let me explain some of the notation in the
ipfw command given above. The arguments tell us we're adding a
blocking (<b  >b</b>) rule for the UDP protocol. The rule
is accepting UDP datagrams from any host (0.0.0.0/0) to
20.2.51.105, but only those destined for port 161. 20.2.51.105 is
the address for one of the interfaces on the firewall.</p><p>Assume the above rule for SNMP is not what we wanted. Let's
say we only wanted to allow SNMP queries from one particular
network&mdash;for example 20.2.61.0 (subnetted of course). We can
delete the rule we just added and then put in our new rule.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># ipfw del b accept udp from 0.0.0.0/0 \
  to 20.2.51.105 161
# ipfw add b accept udp from 20.2.61.0/24 \
  to 20.2.51.105 161
</b></span>
</pre><p><a href="1212f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a> shows our new rule
set. The syntax 20.2.61.0/24 allows you to specify a netmask with
the address. The /24 says there is a 24 bit netmask or
255.255.255.0.
</p><p>The more astute reader at this point may be asking, &ldquo;What
the heck do those rules mean anyway?&rdquo; I'll get to that, but first,
I want to talk about a utility which I find preferable to
ipfw.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> (version 1.2)
program by Jos Vos (available from
<a href="http://www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm" target="_self">www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm</a>)
is an administrative utility for IP firewalling and accounting
which is similar to ipfw. It offers, I think, a slightly more
intuitive interface, better output, and a better man page (not
everyone reads the source code for documentation).</p><p>To list the rules shown in <a href="1212f3.html" target="_self">Figure
3</a>, issue this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># ipfwadm -B -l -n</b></span>
IP firewall block rules, default policy: accept
typ prot source         destination   ports
den tcp  0.0.0.0/0      20.2.51.105   * -&gt; *
den tcp  0.0.0.0/0      192.168.1.1   * -&gt; *
acc udp  20.2.61.0/24   20.2.51.105   * -&gt; 161
rej udp  0.0.0.0/0      192.168.1.1   * -&gt; *
acc udp  0.0.0.0/0      20.2.51.105   53 -&gt; *
rej udp  0.0.0.0/0      20.2.51.105   * -&gt; *
</pre><p>Notice a couple of things. First, ipfwadm always shows the
default policy; I like to see this. Second, the type fields for
these rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rej udp  0.0.0.0/0      192.168.1.1   * -&gt; *
rej udp  0.0.0.0/0      20.2.51.105   * -&gt; *
</pre><p>are set for reject, rather than deny, as shown in ipfw's output in
<a href="1212f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a>. Well, they really are
set to reject. ipfw only supports the deny and accept policies, not
reject.</p><p>Given our vast knowledge on setting and listing rules, let's
rebuild the table again (except for the SNMP rule) while adding a
few more details. But first, we'll define what our network looks
like, shown in <a href="1212f4.html" target="_self">Figure 4</a>.</p><p>We'll call the 20.2.51.0 network the &ldquo;outside&rdquo; network and
the 192.168.1.0 the &ldquo;inside&rdquo; network. Since blocking rules apply
to the firewall itself, the rules will be set on deathstar. First,
we'll flush any rules we have and set the default policy to
accept:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># ipfwadm -B -f
# ipfwadm -B -p accept
</b></span>
</pre><p>Now we'll define what we need to block. The protocols you can
choose to block are TCP, UDP, and ICMP. We want to allow ICMP
messages to the firewall, so we can't just block everything. We
could block TCP by adding the rule:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># ipfwadm -B -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 20.2.51.105
</b></span>
</pre><p>but that would be not be adequate. That rule would end up blocking
all traffic <span   class="bold"><b>from</b></span> the firewall, as
well as traffic <span   class="bold"><b>to</b></span> the firewall.
Therefore, an administrator could not telnet or ftp from the
machine. That may be desirable, but let's assume we'll let out TCP
traffic originating from inside. What we would like is to block all
connection attempts to the firewall while letting connections go
out. We can modify the rule with the <b  >-y</b> option.
This will do what we want by blocking any TCP segments from any
host to the firewall that have the SYN bit set.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># ipfwadm -B -y -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 20.2.51.105
</b></span>
</pre><p>Remembering that the firewall has two interfaces, we block the
   second interface also:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b># ipfwadm -B -y -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 192.168.1.1
</b></span>
</pre><p>That is too restrictive, in that connections from the inside
network to the firewall will be blocked also. We can refine the
rule to block all TCP connection requests only if they come in over
the outside interface (20.2.51.105).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -B -y -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 20.2.51.105 -I 20.2.51.105
# ipfwadm -B -y -a deny -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 192.168.1.1 -I 20.2.51.105
</pre><p>There, that wasn't too bad.</p><p>Now that we've taken care of TCP traffic, let's write some
rules for UDP. Since UDP has many problems that we won't discuss in
detail here, we'll just block it all. The rules will be the same
for TCP, except since there's no SYN bit, there's no need for
<b  >-y</b>, and so we'll reject the packet instead of
denying it. The reason we reject it is that ICMP port unreachable
messages make sense to UDP based applications, but are ignored by
TCP applications. It would be nice if the ip_fw code sent TCP
Resets if the rule was for TCP and marked for rejection, but it
doesn't. So our rules for UDP will be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -B -a reject -P udp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 192.168.1.1 -I 20.2.51.105
# ipfwadm -B -a reject -P udp -S 0.0.0.0/0 \
  -D 20.2.51.105 -I 20.2.51.105
</pre><p>Setting up those rules, we find that blocking all UDP traffic
isn't such a good idea after all. If we have telnet, then we will
probably want to be able to resolve hostnames. So we open up DNS.
Before we do that, though, let's look at the traffic pattern for a
DNS query so that we can gauge what we'll need to write.
<a href="1212f5.html" target="_self">Figure 5</a> contains tcpdump output
of a DNS query from deathstar to mccoy, an &ldquo;outside&rdquo; DNS server.
</p><p>We can see we will have to have two rules&mdash;one for the query
going out (sending to port 53 on the remote machine) and one for
the response (sending to port 53 on the firewall from the remote
machine). The rule can be written as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -B -a accept -P udp -S 20.2.51.105  \
  -D 0.0.0.0/0 53
# ipfwadm -B -a accept -P udp -S 0.0.0.0/0 53 \
  -D 20.2.51.105
</pre><p>Since this two-way traffic is common among many protocols
there's an option you can set to condense the two rules into one.
The <b  >-b</b> option sets bi-directional mode, which
installs a rule that matches traffic in both directions. We can
then get away with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -B -a accept -b -P udp -S 0.0.0.0/0 53 \
  -D 20.2.51.105
</pre><p>Now that we've recreated our table, we can get a listing of
the rules with extended (<b  >-e</b>) output. This is
shown in <a href="1212f6.html" target="_self">Figure 6</a>. Notice the
extended output contains packet and byte counts for the blocking
rules. The firewall code automatically maintains accounting
information for the forwarding and blocking rules.
</p><p>What we have accomplished so far is protecting the machine
deathstar to suit our environment. To protect the internal network
we will need to develop the proper forwarding rules. Before I just
start typing in rulesets, I like to build a table of what's allowed
and disallowed. <a href="1212f7.html" target="_self">Figure 7</a> shows the
table I put together to establish the blocking rules. Note that the
asterisk in the rules table indicates any host address or any port
number.</p><p>We can build the same type of table for our forwarding
ruleset. Building our table should be simple if we have a security
policy in place. Let's assume that the part of our security policy
that discusses firewalls will allow TELNET and FTP out, and e-mail
(SMTP) in both directions. Further, e-mail is only allowed to go to
the mailhub (since there's only one machine on the internal
network, it will be the mailhub&mdash;humor me).
<a href="1212f8.html" target="_self">Figure 8</a> shows the generic rules
table for the forwarding ruleset.</p><p>The stance of the firewall is one of &ldquo;deny everything&rdquo;.
This is a very common policy for firewalls because the only packets
that will be forwarded are the ones which are explicitly
allowed.</p><p>The rules are fairly straightforward except for the source
and destination ports numbered 1024 or greater. The reasons for
this are basically historical. Most Unix client programs, such as
TELNET, assign their ephemeral port range between 1024 and 5000.
Ports 1 through 1023 are known as &ldquo;reserved ports&rdquo;. These are for
server applications such as telnetd, ftpd, etc. Almost all TCP/IP
stacks follow this convention and because of it we can take
advantage of it in our ruleset&mdash;to help guarantee client-only
communications coming into the network. The reason I don't use the
range 1024-5000 is because not all devices adhere to this Unix
tradition. For example, annex terminal servers start their
ephemeral port range at 10000.</p><p>Here are the commands to establish our forwarding
rules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -F -f
# ipfwadm -F -p deny
# ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 23 \
  -D 192.168.1.0/24 1024:65535
# ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -P tcp -S 0.0.0.0/0 21 \
  -D 192.168.1.0/24 1024:65535
# ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -P tcp -S &gt;0.0.0.0/0 20 \
  -D 192.168.1.0/24 1024:65535
# ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -P tcp -S &gt;0.0.0.0/0 25 \
  -D 192.168.1.2 1024:65535
# ipfwadm -F -a accept -b -P tcp -S &gt;192.168.1.2 25 \
  -D 0.0.0.0/0 1024:65535
</pre><p>To set up deathstar as the firewall machine, the ipfwadm
commands would be put into a file and executed as a shell script.
Deathstar uses the file /usr/local/etc/set-rules.sh. To bring the
machine up properly, it would be wise to establish the rules within
the kernel before the network interfaces are brought up. The
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1 on deathstar contains the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# set firewall rules
/bin/bash /usr/local/etc/set-rules.sh
# bring up ethernet
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.255 up
# bring up ppp link
/usr/lib/ppp/ppp-on
</pre><p>Deathstar is, in reality, my desktop machine. I've loaded just
about everything on it, so it doesn't make a very good firewall. A
firewall, as we have described it, should run the bare minimum of
software in order to function. Normally this means that compilers,
X, games, or anything that doesn't have to do with the kernel or
communications are taken off of the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x263e7d8"></a>Checking Your Work</h2></div></div><p>Even with generic tables to work with, you may not always get
the rules the way you want them. It's nice to be able to check your
work. The ipfwadm utility offers the <b  >-c</b> option
to check packets against your rules. For example, to check if a
packet from some host can send mail to an internal host other than
warbird, we can run:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -F -c -P tcp -S &gt;195.1.1.1 1024 \
  -D 192.168.1.5 25 -I 20.2.51.105
</pre><p>This would yield the response <b  >packet
denied</b>. When using <b  >-c</b> to check a rule,
you need to be very specific and supply a source address and port,
destination address and port, and an interface address.
</p><p>The other way to test your environment is with live traffic.
If you suspect traffic is not being forwarded because of your
ruleset, you can use tcpdump to monitor the traffic coming into and
going out of the firewall. It becomes fairly obvious if the
firewall is not allowing legitimate traffic to go through. For
example, when I set up the rules to allow mail through, I noticed
it took an exceptionally long time to send a message. tcpdump
revealed that the receiver, mccoy in this case, was sending IDENT
messages back to the source but they were being blocked by the
firewall. By adding a rule to allow IDENT messages, mail went much
faster. Creating this rule is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p><p>For rudimentary logging, a rule may be set with the
<b  >-k</b> option, which will cause the kernel to print
out a message via syslog for all matching packets. However, setting
up the kernel to understand the <b  >-k</b> option is not
straightforward. The kernel needs to be compiled with
<b  >CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE</b> defined. To do this,
just add the definition to the Makefile in the net/inet directory
in the kernel source directory. Unfortunately, the code defined in
the <b  >CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE</b> section of
ip_fw.c does not compile cleanly in 1.2.x distributions. The fix is
simple and implemented in the latest 1.3.x versions of the
kernel.</p><p>If you set up the kernel to support the <b  >-k</b>
option you will receive output in the /var/adm/messages file
similar to that shown in <a href="1212f9.html" target="_self">Figure
9</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x254d580.0x263edb0"></a>Concluding Comments</h2></div></div><p>The firewall we just built can be replaced by almost any
router you can purchase from a vendor. However, turning a Linux
machine into a packet filtering router is a cheap and very
effective alternative.</p><p>There are several limitations to the firewall code. Its
inadequate logging capabilities are a big miss; documentation is
lacking; and the inability to filter on IP options do not allow the
filtering router to be as flexible as it might be.</p><p>For many environments, the firewall facilities of the Linux
kernel can be more than sufficient, but for those who need
commercial-grade firewall software for Linux, or software that can
run under Linux, there are solutions. The shareware ipfirewall code
from Daniel Boulet, mentioned earlier in this article, addresses
several of the problems just stated. Also, the commercial Mazama
Packet Filter from Mazama Software Labs is a real &ldquo;bells and
whistles&rdquo; product. It comes complete with nice documentation, a
filter &ldquo;language&rdquo; for defining the rulesets (this is a winner), a
GUI for very simple administration, and fixes for the technical
problems (such as IP options and TCP SYN/ACK filtering).</p><p>One last concept not mentioned in this article is that of IP
Masquerading. Very perceptive readers will notice the network
warbird is on (192.168.1.0) is a private IP address. That is, it
not one assigned by the InterNIC, but can be used for local or
private IP-based networks not connected to the Internet. I can get
away with using this addressing scheme because the machine called
relay is a commercial firewall that performs masquerading
(otherwise known as address hiding). All connections going out of
the 20.2.51 or 192.168.1 networks have a source address of relay
from the perspective of the remote machine. As you might be able to
guess from its name, relay is also an application proxy gateway.
Linux also has the ability to hide addresses, but that is a topic
for another article.</p></div></div>
