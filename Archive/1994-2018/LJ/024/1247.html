    The three year criminal investigatin of the author of PGP -
    Pretty Good Privacy is over - the case was closed without
    prosecution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The three-year criminal investigation of
Philip Zimmermann, the author of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), by the
U.S. federal government was closed without prosecution. Mr.
Zimmermann had been alleged to have violated the antiquated U.S.
export control laws in releasing PGP.
</p><p>A few days later, the U.S. Supreme court ruled in favor of
Borland in the Lotus copyright infringement suit. This means that
the court has again upheld the notion that a user interface is not
copyright-able, which is certainly a relief to the free software
community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee500"></a>David 1, Goliath 0</h2></div></div><p>Those who tuned into last month's <span   class="bold"><b>Stop
the Presses</b></span> read about what I termed &ldquo;The Desktop
War&rdquo;, and about two products which are attempting to bring MS
Windows applications to Linux and other platforms: The freeware
program Wine, and a commercial product called
<span   class="bold"><b>TWIN XPDK</b></span>, created by a small
company called Willows Software. There has been a recent flurry of
activity at Willows.</p><p>Last month, the European Computer Manufacturers Association
(ECMA) approved a new standard called APIW (Application Programming
Interface for Windows) over the objections of Microsoft. This
standard, authored by Willows, is now on track for ISO approval as
an international standard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1dee710"></a>David 2, Goliath 0</h2></div></div><p>This month, Willows announced that they are releasing
binaries and source code for XPDK (a toolkit for porting MS Windows
applications to Linux and Unix and soon Mac, OS/2, and Netware,
which, not surprisingly, follows the APIW specification) free for
non-commercial use. At the same time, they announced their
extensive commercial support program, which is detailed on their
World Wide Web site,
<a href="http://www.willows.com" target="_self">www.willows.com</a></p><p>Willows has officially said that they do not support using
XPDK for running off-the-shelf Windows program, because supporting
it would be extremely time-intensive and take more resources than
they have. However, they discovered during beta testing that many
people joined the beta test group solely to attempt to run
off-the-shelf binaries with the included &ldquo;xwin&rdquo; Windows program
loader. By releasing the source code, as well as the binaries, free
for non-commercial use, they allow technically capable users to
support themselves and others, even using the xwin program to run
off-the-shelf binaries. Essentially, the non-commercial users will
be &ldquo;paying&rdquo; for the software by contributing bug reports, and bug
fixes if they are capable.</p><p>While the xwin program currently only supports the 16-bit
windows interface, the library can be compiled in a 16-bit or
32-bit version. Willows says that the full Win32s API will be
supported by June, because they have already written most of the
infrastructure that is necessary.</p><p>When asked whether he thinks Wine poses any threat to
Willows' business, Rob Farnum, CEO of Willows, said that he doesn't
think so, for a few reasons. Essentially, Wine has a much narrower
scope: running windows binaries on a few Intel Unix platforms, and
eventually providing a win32s library for most 32-bit Unix
platforms. By contrast, XPDK can run Windows binaries on other
processors, and is not X- or Unix-specific. It is already running
on PowerPC Macs and is targeted to be released for OS/2, Netware,
and both flavors of Macintosh this year. This doesn't mean that
Willows doesn't take Wine seriously; they have paid close attention
to its development and regularly benchmark XPDK against it.</p><p>When asked what pieces were currently missing from XPDK, Rob
said that implementing OLE is the biggest technical challenge
facing them. When asked whether he thought Microsoft's recent
noises about OLE for Unix were meaningful, he said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; His
reasons were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The projected release date is too late to be
meaningful. The actual coding is being done by Software AG, who has
licensed the OLE code from Microsoft, and who is projecting a late
1997 or 1998 release date.</p></li><li><p>OLE for Unix is <span   class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span>
available from Mainsoft and Bristol, as part of their Windows API
on Unix packages.</p></li><li><p>OLE is so tied to Windows internals that it isn't
clear what OLE on Unix would mean, anyway, and Microsoft has not
made this clear.</p></li></ul></div><p>He suggests that the announcement was a tactical move by
Microsoft against CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture)
and the OMG (the Object Management Group with supervises CORBA).
Microsoft would like to be able to ignore its promises to provide
an ORB (Object Request Broker) for Windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cf6580.0x1deece8"></a>The Latest, The Greatest</h2></div></div><p>Linus Torvalds has stated that another code freeze is about
to go into effect, which will result in a new stable version of
Linux. Linus has stated that he is leaning towards calling this new
version <span   class="bold"><b>2.0</b></span> instead of
<span   class="bold"><b>1.4</b></span> (just call it
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux 96</b></span>...), since it now
supports multiple platforms and multi-processing.</p><p>A few months after the new stable release is made, <i  >Linux Journal</i> will include an article on how to upgrade safely from
version 1.2, just as we did for upgrading from 1.0 to 1.2. We will
also detail the changes. Here's a preview:</p><p>Improvements in the new version will include (but not be
limited to!) support for more hardware, bug fixes, major
performance enhancements (some benchmarks have improved by
200-300%), and new networking features. In particular, new
filesystem support has been added to allow Linux systems to mount
Novell file servers (<span   class="bold"><b>ncpfs</b></span>) and
Windows shared volumes
(<span   class="bold"><b>smbfs</b></span>).</p></div></div>
