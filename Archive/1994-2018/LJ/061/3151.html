    An introduction to several small graphical tools for the
    daily work of system administration.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x19974a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Under Linux, you can do virtually
everything from the command line. For the administrator of a Linux
server, this is extremely useful for two reasons:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>All administrative tasks from any site in the local
network can be done via a simple TELNET session.</p></li><li><p>A lot of administrative work can be easily
automated via shell scripts.</p></li></ul></div>

Compared to a single-user system such as Windows NT, which knows no
remote login, lacks a scripting language and has no command-line
equivalent to many administrative point-and-click operations, these
are serious advantages which save the administrator eons of time
and help make Linux an &ldquo;admin-friendly&rdquo; system.
</p><p>However, for those who use Linux as their desktop OS, many
operations would be easier with a GUI than by typing cryptic
commands at the shell prompt. Even for the conservative user who is
not yet ready to exchange his laboriously customized FVWM for KDE,
Linux offers many graphical tools for common tasks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x19977c0"></a>Getting Help</h2></div></div><p>For information on a specific command, you need to read its
man page, which can be done by typing <b  >man</b> at the
command line. A more comfortable way, however, is to use a man page
viewer such as <span   class="bold"><b>xman</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>tkman</b></span>. While xman is an ugly grey
mouse from the early days of the X Window System, tkman by Tom
Phelps is a truly nice GUI for browsing man pages.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3151f1.large.jpg"><img src="3151f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Manpage Viewer tkman

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>tkman</b></span> displays man pages in
a pleasant way (see Figure 1), knows hypertext links to other
related man pages, allows regexp searches within the man page and
has a built-in <span   class="bold"><b>apropos</b></span> command
that offers man pages for a given keyword. If you want to read a
man page from a specific section, you must add a dot and the
section number in the command entry field; e.g., if you want to get
help on the C library function
<span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> (man page section 3) rather
than the shell command <span   class="bold"><b>printf</b></span> (man
page section 1), you must enter <b  >man
printf.3</b>.</p><p>Moreover, you may print out the displayed man page, but
printing is a bit tricky to get working. Printing is started from
the menu &ldquo;Occasionals&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;Kill Trees&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;lp&rdquo;, which
invokes the man page text processor
<span   class="bold"><b>groff</b></span> with the options
<b  >-Tps</b> for PostScript output and
<b  >-l</b> to send output directly to the printer. The
latter option will not work unless the print command is specified
in groff's configuration file /usr/share/groff/font/devps/DESC.
Hence, you will need to consult groff's man page if printing from
within tkman does not work.</p><p>Another source of information is hypertext info pages, which
consist of nodes with an internal hierarchical structure. While man
pages are more appropriate for the documentation of simple shell
commands, info pages are more appropriate for programs or libraries
that need extensive documentation&mdash;theoretically. In reality, some
crazy programmers decided to move the documentation of elementary
shell commands like <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span> from man pages to info pages;
hence, everyone needs an info reader.</p><p>On the command line, you can read info pages with the
<span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span> command, which fires up Emacs
in its info mode. Alternatively, you can use
<span   class="bold"><b>tkinfo</b></span> by Kennard White and Axel
Boldt as a graphical info page viewer. When started without any
command-line argument, tkinfo displays the &ldquo;dir&rdquo; info node under
which the GNU utilities reside. If you do not like tkinfo's display
font, you can add a <b  >tkinfo*Text.font</b> resource in
your .xresources or .xdefaults file. Although tkinfo has a
better-organized display and is more intuitive to use than Emacs'
info mode, it also has a serious drawback. Most nodes entered in
the &ldquo;File&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;Goto Node&rdquo; menu are not found. For example,
tkinfo cannot find the node &ldquo;ls&rdquo;, even when invoked via
<b  >tkinfo ls</b> on the command line. To reach the node
&ldquo;ls&rdquo;, you must navigate through the info hierarchy, a
time-consuming maneuver.</p><p>Fortunately, most commands are documented completely in their
man page as well; hence, there is often no need to bother with info
pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1998210"></a>Controlling Processes</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>qps</b></span> by Matthias Engdegard is
a graphical incarnation of <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span>, top
and <span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> and is based on the Qt
toolkit. <span   class="bold"><b>qps</b></span> is an attractive and
powerful tool. You can use it as an advanced version of
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> by selecting &ldquo;All Processes&rdquo;
from the &ldquo;View&rdquo; menu, specifying the &ldquo;Update Period&rdquo; in the
&ldquo;Options&rdquo; menu and clicking on &ldquo;CPU&rdquo; in the header line of the
process list to make qps sort the list by the used CPU time. This
will reveal which processes are eating the processor time on your
system (see Figure 2). Or you can use qps as a combination of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ps</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>kill</em></span> by selecting
a process from the process list and sending a signal from the
&ldquo;Signal&rdquo; menu.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3151f2.large.jpg"><img src="3151f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1998738"></a>Managing Files</h2></div></div><p>At first glance, the wide variety of file managers
(xfilemanager, xdtm, mfm, xfm, xgroups, et. al.) that comes with
every Linux distribution seems to be promising. However, almost all
of these tools are either very basic, very ugly or both. TkDesk by
Christian Bolik is the only exception I have encountered.</p><p>Actually, TkDesk is much more than a simple file manager (see
&ldquo;Introducing TkDesk&rdquo; by John Blair in <i  >LJ</i>,
March 1998). By default, it even starts a separate button bar that
reigns over the desktop. This obtrusive behaviour is easily turned
off via the menu &ldquo;TkDesk&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;Toggle Appbar&rdquo;. When I started
using TkDesk, it often stuck for indefinite intervals with no
obvious reason. It took me some time to realize that it was trying
to create sound effects not supported by my system. If this default
setting causes trouble, it can be turned off in the menu
&ldquo;Options&rdquo;&lt;-&gt;&ldquo;Use Sound&rdquo;.</p><p>I use TkDesk primarily for browsing files that are buried
deep in my system directory trees. This can be done very fast,
since TkDesk has a built-in file browser/editor. Moreover, it
displays files in three directory list boxes, making it easy to
change directories back and forth. Three is the default, but you
can change it to any number you wish.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1998948"></a>Comparing Files</h2></div></div><p>Often, there is a need to check the differences between two
versions of a file. You can use the shell command
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> for this purpose, but the
output of the graphical tools
<span   class="bold"><b>mgdiff</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>tkdiff</b></span> is much easier to
read.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>mgdiff</b></span> by Daniel Williams
can be invoked like diff with two file names as command-line
parameters. Alternatively, it allows interactive file selection
from the &ldquo;File&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;Open&rdquo; menu; hence, it is possible to
invoke mgdiff from your window manager's program menu.
<span   class="bold"><b>mgdiff</b></span> displays the selected files
in two boxes and shows an overview of differences in a small bar on
the right (see Figure 3). Changes, insertions and deletions are
highlighted in different colors, which can be customized by the
corresponding X-resources in your .xresources or .xdefaults file;
see mgdiff's man page for details. Moreover, you can easily merge
the compared files into a new file simply by clicking on the
respective versions of the differences and saving the result with
the &ldquo;File&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;Save As&rdquo; menu.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3151f3.large.jpg"><img src="3151f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Differences Made Visible with mgdiff
</p></div></div><p>For programmers using a version control system,
<span   class="bold"><b>tkdiff</b></span> by John M. Klassa is
another useful difference tool. In contrast to mgdiff, tkdiff can
be invoked only from the shell prompt because it requires file
names as command-line arguments.
<span   class="bold"><b>tkdiff</b></span> has an internal help
function but no external man page, which occasionally makes it
inconvenient to get usage information. Beside these trifles, tkdiff
offers the same functionality as mgdiff. Moreover, you can check a
file versus different versions of that file registered in a version
control system (RCS, CVS or SCCS). For example, the command
<b  >tkdiff -r <i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>
compares <span   class="emphasis"><em>filename</em></span> with the revision most
recently checked in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1d91278"></a>Managing Archives</h2></div></div><p>The standard data exchange format between different UNIX
computers is the tape archive format (tar). Additionally, these
archives are often compressed with
<span   class="bold"><b>compress</b></span> (commercial UNIX systems)
or <span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span> (Linux), resulting in tgz
files. You can use the shell command
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> to create, extract or list the
contents of a tar file. Alternatively,
<span   class="bold"><b>xtar</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>tkzip</b></span> provide graphical front ends
to tar.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xtar</b></span> by Rik Turnbull can
only list and extract archives, but normally that is all you need.
When you open an archive with xtar, it displays a list of all files
in the archive. A double click on a file in the list starts a
built-in file browser. This is very useful for new software
packages, because you can read the installation instructions and
README files before unpacking the archive.</p><p>If you prefer a graphical tool for creating archives, you
need a more elaborate package such as TkZip by Robert Woodside. In
my opinion, TkZip is too elaborate: each mouse click opens a new
window, which quickly becomes confusing, and my eyes cannot get
accustomed to the colored frames and buttons.</p><p>When fired up, TkZip displays a list of the files in the
current directory; archive files can be opened with a double click
on the respective file. As with xtar, you can browse text files by
clicking on the files in the archive list. However, you must first
specify a graphical viewer (e.g.,
<span   class="bold"><b>xless</b></span>) from the viewer list;
otherwise, TkZip will write the contents of the file to standard
output.</p><p>Creating archives with TkZip is a bit more involved, since it
requires hopping through a suite of file selection dialogs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>From the main window, select &ldquo;File&rdquo;-&gt;&ldquo;New
Archive&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Enter the archive type and the archive file name
and choose &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Click on &ldquo;Add&rdquo; in the pop-up archive-list
window.</p></li><li><p>Select single files for the archive by clicking on
files in the next window and choose the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button.</p></li><li><p>Clicking on &ldquo;Close&rdquo; in the archive-list window
eventually writes the archive file.</p></li></ul></div><p>Compared to the tar shell command, creating an archive with
TkZip is much more intricate and can save time only in the rare
situation when you want to pack several files from different ends
of your file system into one archive. In the more common case, when
you simply want to pack files from one or two directories, the
shell command is both faster and easier to use.
