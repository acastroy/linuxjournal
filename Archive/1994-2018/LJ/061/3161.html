    Creat is a tool set for teaching embedded systems. In designing
    it, Mr. Bailey wanted it to be useful for real problems, cheap enough to
    build
    on the pittance which is an undergraduate's project budget, and
    totally open and accessible to the curious.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211b580.0x2213450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Creat stands for Combined Resource
Embedded Application Toolkit. It is a collection of tools pulled
together from the Internet to permit Linux users (and, in the
future, any UNIX users) to construct simple projects based on the
Motorola MC68HC811 8-bit microcontroller. For the hardware part of
the project, the idea was to provide a general microcontroller for
students who wanted to have a small lump of computing power in
their final-year projects; for those who wanted to specialize in
applied microcomputing, to study the innards of the project. I
wanted it to be accessible enough from &ldquo;both ends&rdquo;--programming
and hardware&mdash;so that an expert in one would benefit from
experience with the other. The whole project turned out to be a
positive experience and a lesson in the benefits of cooperation and
open software.
</p><p>In choosing hardware for the exercise, I would have liked to
obtain an up-market 16-bit microcontroller with Linux ported to it.
This would have given seamless integration between host machine and
target platforms, but even now, the cost of such a project is
prohibitive in both cash and development time. The monster thus
created would probably have been a significant overkill for the
target application areas. At the very low end, the Linux community
already has a range of useful utilities aimed at the PIC
microprocessor (see &ldquo;PIC Programming with Linux&rdquo; by Brian C.
Lane, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, October 1998), which is a
useful chip for replacing large quantities of logic with a single
package. More ambitious projects might make use of a
microcontroller port of Linux itself (see the Linux/Microcontroller
Home Page by D. Jeff Dionne, http://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/uCinux/).
My target was those projects in between: more processing power than
you need to count events and run a multiplexed LED display and less
than you need to run X. Our typical projects had an LCD display, a
keyboard and some custom electronics to handle the project-specific
I/O. The handling of interrupts might be important, together with
enough flexibility to store a reasonable amount of data. The
projects need to be highly testable and modifiable, but in the
interests of economy, special hardware adapters and programmers
were to be avoided.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211b580.0x2213608"></a>Putting Together a Solution</h2></div></div><p>With limited time and money, the clear way forward was to
trawl the Net. More than just the hardware must be considered to
build a useful system. To compete with the large and expensive kits
in the marketplace, I would need an in-circuit emulator, a
compiler/assembler and some way of downloading the program and
booting the target board. For the benefit of the hard-line computer
scientist, in-circuit emulators are expensive devices which plug
into the microcontroller socket at one end and the workstation at
the other. They do all the things done by a decent IDE, but can
also ensure the hardware is behaving by monitoring bus control
signals and the like. For microcontrollers, students are encouraged
to plug in a logic analyzer instead: rather like an oscilloscope
with an enormous number of channels and triggering, which can be
locked to a particular data value and hence to the execution of a
particular instruction. You don't get to see a stack trace or
register contents, but you can examine exactly what is going on in
terms of logic levels.</p><p>At the University of Leeds, all Electronic Engineering
graduates are familiar with C. Those who specialize in computer
subjects will also probably have picked up some parsing, X Window
System applications programming, Java or C++ and Occam. The major
requirement is to provide them with &ldquo;right-first-time&rdquo;
prototyping tools, so that they can debug programs on workstations
and get them &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; with as little ado as possible. The
environment within which they are performing their project actually
makes quite a good analogy to a commercial one: too little money
and too big a time pressure to craft the most beautiful and elegant
system imaginable. One thing the School of Electronic and
Electrical Engineering doesn't have is the facility to make
plated-through PCBs (polyclorobenzine circuit boards). It is too
expensive to run because of severe environmental problems
associated with the technology. It is possible for students to
produce single or double-sided copper boards by photo lithography
and etching (and they have), but plating through and the production
of microcontroller boards is truly out of the question. Thus, we
need to make boards for general application. We have them
manufactured externally on large panels and cut up, so they can be
used as the brain of an electrically more simple project built on a
circuit board manufactured in-house.</p><p>The Creat specification required the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>more powerful than a PIC with large data storage
capacity</p></li><li><p>a development environment which is open to C
users</p></li><li><p>very inexpensive to construct</p></li><li><p>flexible in application area</p></li><li><p>no special hardware for programming or
servicing</p></li><li><p>target system simulation to aid debugging</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211b580.0x2213c38"></a>Cooperation vs. Competition</h2></div></div><p>Having produced a requirements spec, it was quite obvious I
would not have time to write all of the necessary code and design
the hardware from scratch. The normal scenario would be to obtain a
loan (or course development grant), hire staff and have them
reinvent the wheel by building yet-another-microcontroller-kit,
then persuade the University to try and market it. Of course, this
would have produced all the usual arguments against releasing the
software source, and the cost would not be much less than $100,000
US by the time everything had been shaken down, even for a simple
system. The openness of the project would be compromised;
distribution, maintenance and servicing issues would arise.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3161f1.large.jpg"><img src="3161f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. PCB with Copper Trace Highlighted

</p></div></div><p>Fortunately, as a long-time Linux user in an EE department, I
had already come across Thomas Nau's PCB program. (Source code is
available from ftp://ftp.uni-ulmde/pub/pcb/, also available as a
Red Hat RPM or as a Debian package. See the README file for more
details.)</p><p>PCB is a drawing package, with many useful debugging aids
including net list import and export, but no auto route or
schematic capture capability. It is ideal for students intricately
hand-drafting a single-sided PCB&mdash;a skill not yet superseded by at
least the majority of commercial packages. Maintenance of the
package has been taken over by Harry Eaton, who looks after such
features as Gerber output (the file format popular amongst PCB
manufacturers). Figure 1 shows this program in action displaying
part of the Creat CPU board. The really good thing about PCB is
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>it comes with a microcontroller circuit
layout</em></span> as a demonstration file. This is one of Thomas's
projects, and I couldn't believe my luck, because it had all the
attributes I needed for Creat. In fact, because Thomas's board was
a full-blown stand-alone application, it was rather too complex for
the tasks we needed, so I set about hacking it down to size.</p><p>The second stroke of luck came when I received an e-mail from
Jerome Debard, a graduate of Toulouse. His degree was in
Engineering, he wanted to gain some work experience and language
skills by working in England, and was prepared to do so for free!
He took the idea of reducing Thomas's board, and in a few weeks of
frenzied activity, got it working, including writing a run-time
library for it. (He also did the cooking at the Annual
Communications Group Rooftop Barbecue, which is the first time that
occasion has ever benefitted from having a French chef.)</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3161f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Creat CPU board

</p></div></div><p>Aside from getting the circuit <span   class="emphasis"><em>mis au
point</em></span>, the hardware was basically wrapped up. Figure 2
shows the bare board after commercial manufacture: its actual size
is about 3.5 inches square with all the components added. To make
the board work, you have to solder up the components labeled in
plain text. If you want it to work without a regulated bench
supply, you will need the components labeled in parentheses too.
This gives you a microcontroller module with 2KB of EEPROM, 256KB
of RAM, 28 digital and 8 analogue I/O lines. This is useful for
some projects, but not really enough for C. Adding the components
labeled in italics gives you up to 128KB of RAM, but leaves only
five I/O lines. Fortunately, Motorola makes a rather useful PRU
(port replacement unit) which can be hung on the address and data
bus, transparently giving you these lines back. Figure 3 shows the
memory map of the system with 128KB fitted. (Motorola, Inc.

Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>With essentially reliable hardware, the work now begins on a
development system and first of all on the C compiler. Back to the
Internet and to the aforementioned Donald Jeff Dionne, in whose
public FTP space I found a binary distribution of exactly the
compiler I needed. Based on the
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> port by Coactive
(http://www.coactive.com/), it was ideal. A common source-code base
could be built to run on the Linux boxes and then cross-compiled
for the Creat board. The binary was in the old a.out format, and I
e-mailed Jeff to find out whether it had been developed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gcc-hc11</b></span> was the C compiler
Jerome had looked at, then rushed out a run-time library including
memory allocation and rudimentary string I/O routines. At the time,
there were two European Community exchange students from Valencia
in the department, so based on the availability of a working gcc,
we started to cook up something which would be useful and
free.</p><p>It is often efficient to divide a microcontroller-based
project into two, testing the hardware and software independently
before using them together. Of course, it is important for the two
tasks to advise each other, but if the project is large, it is
almost certain a hardware group will be working on the project
concurrently with a software group. Creat seeks to make that
process as easy as possible through a strict process of hardware
abstraction. When somebody builds a piece of hardware which might
be of general use, they make a package of it. A package consists of
three things: a PCB layout in pcb format with the same form factor
as the main CPU board, a set of subroutines (which might be written
in C or assembler) with a specific C-language interface, and
another set of C subroutines taking the same arguments which
compile and run on the workstation.</p><p>The key idea is that any program which uses a particular
piece of hardware, e.g., a dot-matrix LCD display, can be written
using the Creat LCD device interface. This provides two main calls:
an initialisation call invoked before the device can be used and
another to write a character on the LCD. Creat's
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> system can be used to build
the application for the Linux box by issuing the commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make depend; make wkstn
</pre><p>After testing, code can be compiled for the 6811 as well
using:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make 6811; make boot
</pre>

and hard on the coding for two packages: one to drive a dot-matrix
LCD and the other to drive a row/column-scanned keyboard. We were
inspired by a previous article (&ldquo;Using Tcl and Tk from Your C
Programs&rdquo; by Matt Welsh, <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
February 1995) which showed how Tcl/TK scripts can be executed by
forking off a new process and then executing a copy of
<span   class="bold"><b>wish</b></span>. Connecting wish through a
pipe to the parent process means commands can be sent to it and
information received back. This makes it very easy to present a
simulated LCD as a wish X window, and much can be achieved without
having to write any X code at all. Even though Xlib-based code
would execute much quicker than a wish script, it shouldn't be a
problem since it is probably a case of a 586 of some sort versus an
8-bit microcontroller.</p><p>Thanks to Danny and Alberto, at least two additional modules
are now available which plug into the Creat bus: the LCD and
keyboard modules. These packages provide the hardware abstraction
interface and use a forked wish script to emulate the LCD and the
keyboard on-screen.</p><p>There is one problem area in which microcontrollers tend to
outperform even Linux&mdash;interrupt handling. Microcontrollers come
loaded with I/O facility, so a huge number of interrupt sources
exist. There are even timers which don't have to connect with the
asynchronous outside world, but just sit there generating
interrupts. These and other troublemakers present a serious problem
for simulation on a Linux platform. The programmer writing the
hardware abstraction code might want to generate a handful of
different interrupts, but the only ones present for the purpose of
simulation are SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. A single timer can produce that
many. We therefore devised a method for the simulation of multiple
interrupt sources.</p><p>When there is a conflict of interests in hardware simulation,
it is important to place the strain on the Linux side of things
rather than on the microcontroller. The interrupt handling method
is basically transparent as far as the 68HC811 is concerned. It
amounts to the insertion of a vector in an interrupt table in
response to a &ldquo;register interrupt&rdquo; subroutine call. At the Linux
end, things are more complicated by the fact that all processes
which generate interrupts are told to generate the same interrupt.
In addition, each one shares a pipe with the parent process, down
which they write a byte before raising SIGUSR1. When the handler
gets called, it uses <span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span>
against all pipes to establish which process needs servicing, then
looks in its own table of service routines and calls the
appropriate one.
<a href="3161l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1</b></span></a> shows the code which registers an interrupt
process.</p><p>With the registration process available, it is possible to
create packages that cause interrupts to take place. The simplest
example is the timer device, which generates interrupts at a
regular interval. The routine to create a timer device is
<span   class="bold"><b>init_timer</b></span> and in the case of the
microcontroller, it would only have to set the appropriate timer
interrupt vector and start the hardware timer in free-running mode.
When compiled on the workstation, the function registers an
interrupt source, then forks off a function which spends most of
its time sleeping, awakening now and then to raise a signal. The
code appears in
<a href="3161l2.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
2.</b></span></a></p><p>Whether the interrupt source is a timer or some other
simulated I/O device, the same interrupt service routine,
<span   class="bold"><b>sigusr1_handler</b></span>
(<a href="3161l4.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
4</b></span></a>), is called each time a signal is raised. The
signal handler has access to the list of registered processes, so
it can call <span   class="bold"><b>scanlist</b></span>
(<a href="3161l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
3)</b></span></a> to catch the culprit and execute an
associated interrupt service routine. The whole thing acts like a
kind of interrupt multiplexor, so that with the help of a list of
pipes, the appropriate source can be associated with the
appropriate service routine, even though all possible sources raise
the same signal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x211b580.0x220b8b8"></a>What Have We Done; What Have We Learned?</h2></div></div><p>In actuality, all I have done is manage a project. The
project had some excellent resources and my input was to point them
in what I feel is an educationally useful direction. I hope
&ldquo;real&rdquo; applications (whatever they might be) will find this
package useful too. The whole bundle is available in a package on
my web site
(http://www.ee.leeds.ac.uk/homes/NJB/Software/linux-stuff.html#creat)
and you can browse the manual written by Danny and Alberto on-line.
Thomas's PCB, as modified by Jerome and others, is also there,
along with the port replacement unit PCB and all other software
mentioned above. The manual contains over 130 pages.</p><p>I hope people will be encouraged to contribute packages to
this project. The modules available so far are not entirely
complete. I need to tidy up the interrupt registry to make it truly
modular and make the vector insertion work on the microcontroller.
Issues with the LCD module need resolving, such as the display size
being fixed in the Tcl/Tk script; and a new version of gcc6811
needs building, using an up-to-date gcc as the base and glibc.
However, on the positive side, among the things which have delayed
my fixing these problems is that the whole system does actually
seem to work together rather well. Figure 4 shows the simulated
keyboard and LCD, with a simple counter ticking away in the
background.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3161f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
