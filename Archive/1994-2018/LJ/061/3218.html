Open Software Foundation (OSF). The Motif Xm library is a software
layer used with Intrinsics' Xt library and the Xlib library of the
X Window System. According to the Motif user-interface
specification, Motif is independent of how it is implemented, so it
is theoretically possible to implement the Motif GUI on a different
windowing system. PC users will immediately recognize the
similarity of the Motif GUI to the Microsoft Windows
3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and OS/2 GUI.
</p><p>Motif has become a standard in the UNIX world and is the
basis for the common desktop environment (CDE). The Motif 2.1
release placed great emphasis on compatibility with CDE. Since CDE
is based on Motif 1.2, some features and components available in
Motif 2.0 are no longer supported under Motif 2.1. This provides
the programmer with a minimum of portability problems in designing
Motif-based programs for a variety of UNIX systems.</p><p>Motif is an unusual choice in the Linux and free software
world, as it is commercially licensed software. The license cost
about $149 US at the time of this writing (early 1999), and you
must purchase a license for each copy of Motif you run. You may not
redistribute the Motif library with your software, but you may
freely distribute statically linked binaries created for people who
don't have a copy of Motif on their system. The Netscape browser is
an example of a statically linked Motif application. People who
have Motif libraries can compile their software dynamically,
creating faster and smaller binaries.</p><p>The most compelling reason for Linux users to use Motif is
the ability to create programs for commercial UNIX systems on their
home computer. However, many free software programmers prefer to
work with totally free toolkits such as gtk+. Another alternative
is Lesstif, which is a free Motif work-alike. Lesstif is still
considered alpha-release software, but is a good place to start if
you want to teach yourself some of the fundamentals of Motif
programming.</p><p>I tested Motif 2.1 from Red Hat Software. Red Hat gets its
Motif license from Metro Link, which in turn licenses it from the
OSF. Although I have been very happy with my Red Hat product, I've
noticed a new Motif 2.1.10 release is available. This is not a
major upgrade but mostly bug fixes. I sent an e-mail message to
support, asking about the possibility of an upgrade. They promptly
and kindly told me I could get an upgrade from Metro Link for a
reduced price. Because this was only a minor upgrade, I didn't feel
that even the reduced price was warranted. Red Hat did tell me they
would understand if I wanted to return the product, but they didn't
have any arrangement for an upgrade because of the licensing
agreement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf07580.0xfffc90"></a>In the Package</h2></div></div><p>The Red Hat Motif includes 30 days of installation support,
shared and static libraries, man pages, the UIL compiler, the MWM
window manager, Motif demo programs with source code, a printed
user manual and a lot of other documentation in PostScript form on
CD. As a bonus, you get the KL Group's XRT Professional Developer's
suite of widgets. This version is fully licensed, but if you
require support, you purchase it separately from the KL Group.
These widgets include 2-D and 3-D graph and chart widgets and XRT
gear which includes tabs, tree widgets and various icons.</p><p>If you purchase Motif directly from Metro Link, you can get a
product called Motif Complete. Motif Complete provides you with
Motif 1.2, 2.0 and 2.1 on one CD, so that you can create a custom
installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf07580.0xfffdf0"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>The installation process is quite straightforward and
adequately documented. Just be sure to mount your CD with the
<b  >exec</b> option turned on, as explained in the
README. This allows the programs to be executed directly from the
CD. The process is slightly different for different systems,
depending on whether your system is a.out or ELF, and also whether
your system can use RPM. If you have Slackware, for example, you
need to run the <span   class="bold"><b>instelf.sh</b></span>
program. With Red Hat, you can use
<span   class="bold"><b>glint</b></span> or any other RPM-based
tool.</p><p>Next, you must edit (or create) an .Xclients or .xsession
file to use MWM as your window manager. I chose the .Xclients
method, which allows you to leave your .xinitrc file in place. Here
is a sample .Xclients file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nxterm -geometry 80x44+0+2 +ut &amp;
nxterm -geometry 80x50+509+2 &amp;
# Color for the display or root window
# doesn't need to be put in the background
xsetroot -solid CadetBlue
xscreensaver &amp;
exec mwm
</pre><p>This starts two nxterm windows, sets the background color to
CadetBlue, starts the <span   class="bold"><b>xscreensaver</b></span>
program and the Motif Window Manager. Notice that you use the
normal X Window System programs to do things such as set the
background color. You can get a list of color names for
<span   class="bold"><b>xsetroot</b></span> in the
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt file. If you are creating the .Xclients file
from scratch, don't forget to make it executable with
<b  >chmod&nbsp;+x</b>.
</p><p>Next, the two places to customize resources are the
.Xdefaults file and the .mwmrc file in your home directory. The
.Xdefaults file most likely already exists, and only needs some
lines appended to it. The .mwmrc file should be copied to your home
directory as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /etc/X11/system.mwmrc ~/.mwmrc
</pre><p>Note the User Guide is in error and says the system.mwmrc
file is found in /usr/lib/X11/system.mwmrc.
</p><p>Now you can have some fun customizing your environment and
creating menus. For example, I have these lines appended to my
.Xdefaults file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Mwm*activeBackground: CadetBlue
Mwm*UseIconBox: true
Mwm*keyboardFocusPolicy: pointer
</pre><p>The general format for these lines is
<b  >Mwm*resource:&nbsp;<i><tt>value</tt></i></b>.
In my file, I've defined the
<span   class="bold"><b>activeBackground</b></span>, i.e., the window
which has the focus, as CadetBlue, which is the same as the
background color I set in my .xinitrc file. Setting the
<span   class="bold"><b>keyboardFocusPolicy</b></span> to
<b  >pointer</b> means moving the mouse pointer to
another window gives that window the focus automatically. Setting
the keyboardFocusPolicy to <b  >explicit</b> would
require you to explicitly click your mouse button in the window to
give it focus.
</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>UseIconBox</b></span> default is
<b  >false</b> which means when you minimize a window,
its icon appears in the root window. Setting the UseIconBox to
<b  >true</b> creates an MWM window which holds the
icons. See Figure 1 for an example of an icon box. The dark black
line around the xterm icon indicates that the xterm window has the
focus. The frame around the Netscape icon indicates that it is
iconized, and the lack of frames around the nxterms, Mail and nedit
icons indicates that the windows are not iconized.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3218f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Icon Box
</p></div></div><p><a href="3218l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1.</b></span></a></p><p>Let's take a look at the .mwmrc file. Listing 1 is a portion
of my modified .mwmrc file copied from system.mwmrc. The complete
file can be found in the archive file
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue61/3218.tgz. Make sure to
enclose your items in exclamation points if they contain spaces.
Mnemonics and accelerators are optional. Mnemonics are one of the
letters in the item which should appear underlined. Once the menu
is chosen, typing the mnemonic is the same as clicking on the item.
An accelerator is a series of keystrokes for accomplishing the
function without using the menu at all. Functions include titles,
exec, separator and menu. Titles are the titles in the menu (see
Figure 2), and separators draw a line in the menu. The program you
want to start is lauched by exec. You can specify the full path
name of the program or just its name, if your path variable is set
correctly. Menus are the sublevel menus. For example, I've created
a menu item &ldquo;games&rdquo; and the name of the menu is Games Menu. Then,
later in the listing, you have the definition for the Games Menu.
Customizing your environment in Motif is easy and fun.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3218f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

compile programs which are dynamically linked, which should make
the binaries smaller and quicker.</p><p>An example I suggest trying is NEdit. This is a nice WYSIWYG
(what you see is what you get) editor available from
ftp://ftp.fnal.gov/. If you don't have Motif, you can still use the
statically linked version of this editor, or try to compile it with
Lesstif. Compiling this program on my system gave me errors of this
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.so: undefined reference to 'XpEndJob'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.so: undefined reference to
XpSelectInput
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.so: undefined reference to
XpGetPdmStartParams
</pre><p>The libXp library comes in XFree86-devel, so the Makefiles
which come with NEdit must be modified to include
<b  >-lXp</b>. You can examine the Makefiles which come
with the demo programs (see Figure 3) to give you clues to other
libraries which are not properly linked.

does provide you with a clean interface and a standard GUI model
for the UNIX environment. It is especially nice for programmers who
want to use their Linux boxes to write software that will easily
port to proprietary UNIX systems.</p><p><a href="3218s2.html" target="_self">Listings</a></p><p><a href="3218s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
