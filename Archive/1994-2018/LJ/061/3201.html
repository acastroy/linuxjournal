Architecture) is one of those acronyms for which most people have
some &ldquo;feel&rdquo;, others have some interest, but very few have any
real experience. This is the first article in a series of three in
which we will attempt to increase the first, augment the second and
remedy the third. We will be quick to point out CORBA's strengths,
but will not shrink from disclosing some of CORBA's current
shortcomings which, while not terribly numerous, nevertheless can
present a stumbling block to the uninitiated.
</p><p>Our goal is to help the Linux programmer new to CORBA get his
feet wet through examination of a very simple CORBA application.
Our simple distributed application is developed using OmniORB, a
free ORB from Oracle-Olivetti Research in Cambridge, England.
OmniORB is a fast, clean implementation of the basic CORBA 2.0
architecture. We have calculated its performance to be anywhere
from 2 to 15 times faster measuring the same code as its commercial
competitors&mdash;plus, it runs on Linux. It implements the CORBA
standard's naming service, although it does not currently support
some of the more popular CORBA services, such as the event service,
the trader service or the life cycle service. (It has a life cycle
service of sorts, but is nonstandard.) It also does not yet offer a
dynamic invocation interface, a dynamic skeleton interface or an
Interface Repository. It does, however, provide a fine thread
abstraction for POSIX pThreads, one that is highly portable (one of
the authors has ported it to HP's tenuous DCE threads
implementation). The OMNIThread abstraction supports Linuxthreads
0.5 and above (POSIX 1003.1c-draft 10 and comes with Red Hat's
glibc implementation) and MIT pThreads and is well worth the
download. The simple example shown here does not require two
separate networked machines, so even if you have only one machine,
you can still get your feet wet. There is no requirement in CORBA
that the objects actually be physically distributed. That design
feature is completely optional.</p><p>We know that CORBA is an approach to distributed programming,
but what exactly is it? CORBA defines a coordinated specification
for the implementation of distributed object communication. CORBA
is a specification managed by the Object Management Group
(http://www.omg.org/), a consortium of over 800 different hardware
and software vendors, whose diverse interests intersect around the
concept of distributed computing. The OMG's goal with CORBA was to
define a communication standard that would be platform-and-language
independent, with a focus on the object-oriented paradigm.</p><p>The primary motivation for distributed programming is
parallel processing, or actually distributing the activity of an
application across several computers so that they are
simultaneously working to solve a problem or a complex of problems.
Resources are generally limited in any environment, and for
applications that are stranded on one machine, the resource pool
(memory, disk, I/O, etc.) can easily become strained. When that
happens, overall throughput and performance of the application
suffers. Distributed programming allows a developer to distribute
the workload of an application across several different machines,
each with its own set of resources. By doing so, the developer can
greatly influence the overall throughput of an application in a
very positive way.</p><p>CORBA provides developers with a framework in which to
develop objects which can communicate with one another on a single
machine or over a network, regardless of the hardware platform or
the programming language. Using CORBA, it is possible for an object
written in C++ on UNIX to communicate with another object written
in Java on Windows or an object written in COBOL on a mainframe.
Several technologies attempt to provide similar functionality:
TCP/IP, Berkeley Sockets, DCOM, Remote Procedure Calls (ONC and
DCE), Java's Remote Method Invocation, et al. System V IPC offers
several inter-process communication capabilities such as shared
memory and message queues, but they are single-machine solutions by
default, whereas CORBA is centered around exposing objects on a
network. CORBA, the implementations of which are often built on top
of some of these components such as TCP/IP, sockets and DCE, offers
a unique package of benefits over and above these
alternatives.</p><p>CORBA allows distribution to take place almost entirely
within the object model, abstracting the details of the object
communication so that the developer has to worry about only the
higher-level interfaces as opposed to the nuts and bolts of the
communication layers. There is a cost in terms of network latency
that any CORBA developer must be conscious of early in the game. In
a sense, the resource limitations of a single computer are traded
for the network limitations in bandwidth and performance. Remember,
each call to a remote object is a network call. If your design
calls for 100 set methods to be called on a remote object just to
initialize it (a very bad CORBA design), you will soon see
performance degradation in a whole new light.</p><p>CORBA objects can be implemented in many different
programming languages running on many different platforms. In order
for a specification to define a framework for such an environment,
it is important to have a platform- and language-independent method
of describing objects. In order to meet this need, CORBA defines a
mapping language called IDL (Interface Definition Language) that is
actually very similar to C++ in syntax. IDL is used to describe the
way a remote object appears to the outside world, along with
properties or methods that exist in the object. An IDL compiler is
then used to translate the IDL into the source code of a particular
implementation language, e.g., C++, Java, C, Ada, Smalltalk and
COBOL. For the server, the IDL compiler creates the source code
needed by the ORB to expose the object to the outside world and
creates a skeleton that is then &ldquo;filled in&rdquo; with the actual
implementation of the object by the developer. For the client, the
IDL compiler creates stubs which allow the remote object to appear
to be local to the client. In order to remain platform-and-language
independent, IDL has its own variable types. The IDL compiler maps
each of these variable types to a representative language construct
in the native language for the client or server.</p><p>Now we can address the question of how CORBA actually works.
The first and most important component to look at is the ORB. In
the CORBA specification, the ORB (Object Request Broker) is the
communication layer that resides between a CORBA object and the
user of the CORBA object. Through the ORB, a client application can
access properties, pass parameters, invoke methods and return
results from a remote object. It is a common misconception that the
ORB is a daemon or a service that implements CORBA&mdash;some ethereal
middleman that floats around out on the network. Actually, the ORB
is a communication layer that resides partially in the client and
partially in the server at the same time. The ORB is responsible
for intercepting a call to a remote object, locating the remote
implementation of the object and facilitating communication with
the remote object. Thus, when we talk about &ldquo;the ORB&rdquo;, we are
talking about the communication capabilities provided to a client
and a server through their respective stubs and skeletons, as well
as through calls those stubs and skeletons make to the ORB
implementation's runtime libraries, which provide low-level
communication and marshaling capabilities.</p><p>Given that an ORB is a communication layer and is responsible
for locating an implementation, it needs some method by which to
find the remote object. CORBA achieves this by assigning all remote
objects a unique IOR (Interoperable Object Reference). The IOR is
like a telephone number by which the client application can call
upon a specific remote object. In order for the client application
to access the remote object server, it must first be able to obtain
an IOR. There are several different methods by which a client can
obtain an IOR, the easiest and least practical being to pass it on
the command line. Many CORBA implementations (such as VisiBroker
and Orbix) have simple proprietary IOR lookup mechanisms that allow
the IOR to be passed to the client using a &ldquo;bind&rdquo; call. The OMG
defines the Naming Service as the preferred way for a client to
obtain an IOR of a remote object. In part three of this series, we
will go into the Naming Service in detail. For our first example,
however, we will pass the IOR of the server's object to the client
in a common file that will be read by the client during
initialization.</p><p>We deliberately created a simple example so that the code can
be easily followed, and we provided a Makefile and Make.rules
because omniORB uses a rather complicated
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> scenario that is difficult to
follow. This sample code was developed and tested using omniORB
2.5.0 running on Red Hat Linux 5.1 (kernel 2.0.35). The code was
compiled using g++ version egcs-2.90.27 980315 (the egcs-1.0.2
default C++ compiler with Red Hat). (We also compiled and ran the
code using the latest omniORB 2.7.0 and egcs 1.1.1.)</p><p>To build and run this example, download omniORB 2.5.0 from
http://www.orl.co.uk/omniORB/omniORB.html. Fill out the form, and
download the correct version of omniORB for your version of
Linux&mdash;it is free. You might want to get down the binary version
that comes with complete source code as well. The binary version
expects you to be using the g++ that comes with gcc 2.7.2. If
you're running egcs (for example, Red Hat 5.x), you will need to go
ahead and recompile omniORB, so it will work with the egcs g++
compiler (choose <b  >i586_linux_2.0_egcs</b> in
<b  >config.mk</b> in the config directory). You can find
out what g++ compiler you are running by typing
<b  >g++&nbsp;-v</b>. Follow the instructions in the
README* files for instructions on building and setting up the
omniORB environment.</p><p>Once you have omniORB installed and built, you can download
the sample code from
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue61/3201.tgz. Then unpack the
tar file. In order to build the sample, you must edit both the
Make.rules and Makefile files. See the file README.build for
information on what to change for your location and compiler. Once
you've edited the appropriate files for your location, simply type
<b  >make</b> to build the samples.</p><p>Once you have built the example, run it by launching the
server in one window (or virtual terminal) by typing
<b  >server</b>. Notice that the IOR for the server's
object is printed to STDOUT. It is also written to a file called
ior.out. Next, run the client in another window by typing
<b  >client</b>. This opens the IOR file, obtains the IOR
for the server's object, then resolves that IOR to an object
reference and makes a call on the remote object. For a remote
connection, you will need to get the ior.out file from the server's
directory to the directory the client is going to run in. You can
do this by using FTP to transfer the file, after the server is up
and running, to the client's directory on the other machine.</p><p>Like most CORBA applications, our simple CORBA example is
made up of three items. First, a server application that
instantiates a CORBA object, then basically blocks forever, thus
exposing the CORBA object to potential clients. Second, the
implementation of the CORBA object itself, which is run when a
client obtains a reference to the server's object. Third, a client
that binds to the CORBA object and proceeds to make calls against
its interface as defined in the IDL for the CORBA object.</p><p>Let's begin with the IDL. Our example has a very simple
interface defined, PushString.
<a href="3201l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1</b></span></a> shows that interface PushString has a single
function, called pushStr, which takes a single input parameter of
IDL type string and returns an IDL boolean value. When this is
compiled by the IDL compiler
(<span   class="bold"><b>omniidl2</b></span>), the following files
are created:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PushString.hh: stub/skeleton header</p></li><li><p>PushStringSK.cc: stub/skeleton code</p></li></ul></div><p>In the omniORB implementation (the creation of stubs and
skeletons is ORB-specific), both the stubs and the skeletons are
defined in the same file for each IDL file processed. The skeleton
for the implementation is called _sk_PushString and it is inherited
by the implementation of PushString as follows (in PushString_i.h):
<pre     class="programlisting">
class PushString_i : public _sk_PushString
</pre>


Every function defined in an interface is declared as a pure
virtual in the skeleton class (in PushString.hh):
<pre     class="programlisting">
virtual CORBA::Boolean pushStr ( const char * inStr ) = 0;
</pre>


When the implementation of PushString (PushString_i) states that it
is inheriting from the skeleton (public _sk_PushString), it pledges
to implement each single pure virtual function in the skeleton
class. In this way, the pledge of an implementation fully
supporting an interface is enforced. It is a compiler error to fail
to implement one of the pure virtual functions declared in the
skeleton.
</p><p>In <a href="3201l2.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
2</b></span></a> (Srv_Main.C), we see the server application
that creates the CORBA object and presents it to potential clients
via the ORB. The first thing the program does is open an output
file called ior.out. This is where it is going to write the IOR for
the object it is about to create. Then, it initializes the
ORB:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::ORB_ptr orb =
CORBA::ORB_init(argc,argv,"omniORB2");
</pre><p>This call takes in parameters to the orb which were passed in
as command-line arguments, such as flags to turn on tracing, set
the name of the server, etc., and uniquely identifies this
initialization as expecting the omniORB2 ORB.
</p><p>After the ORB has been initialized, it is the BOA's (Basic
Object Adapter) turn. The BOA for the server is initialized with
the following call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::BOA_ptr BOA =
orb-&gt;BOA_init(argc,argv,"omniORB2_BOA");
</pre><p>The BOA initialization is ORB-dependent. In omniORB, the name
of the BOA is set to &ldquo;omniORB2_BOA&rdquo; and the user can specify
certain flags to the BOA. A communication layer must be able to
communicate with something, and one of the alternatives developed
in the CORBA specification is the BOA. The BOA resides in a CORBA
server and is responsible for initializing the remote object when a
client requests access. The BOA then provides a translation layer
between the remote representation of the object to which the ORB
communicates and the actual physical implementation of the object.
</p><p>After the BOA has been initialized, the implementation of a
CORBA interface is created, in our case, the PushString interface.
Once the implementation has been created, we register the newly
created implementation with the BOA object by calling the object's
<span   class="bold"><b>_obj_is_ready</b></span> function with the
object reference of the BOA itself, which was returned by the
<span   class="bold"><b>BOA_init</b></span> call. The main purpose
for registering object implementations with the BOA is to let it
know the implementation is running so it can dispatch calls to the
object made by clients.</p><p>Finally, we call
<span   class="bold"><b>impl_is_ready</b></span> on the BOA. We do
this to let the BOA know it should <span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span> begin
to listen for client requests on its designated port. Prior to this
call, although the implementation is ready and waiting, no traffic
will arrive because the BOA is not listening for it. It is the
impl_is_ready call that tells the BOA to start listening for client
connections on behalf of this object's implementation. Depending on
the ORB implementation, the client may block on a function call to
the remote object, or an exception may be thrown if impl_is_ready
has not been called.</p><p>In <a href="3201l3.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
3</b></span></a> (PushString_i.h), we see the implementation's
header file which declares that this implementation will be
implementing the <span   class="bold"><b>pushStr</b></span> function,
but the class must also define its own constructor and destructor.
The IDL compiler does not create the implementation header for you
(some compilers, such as Orbix's
<span   class="bold"><b>idl2cpp</b></span> compiler, will create a
&ldquo;shell&rdquo; implementation header and cpp file if you request it);
generally you have to do that on your own. Notice the class
declaration line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
class PushString_i : public _sk_PushString
</pre><p>We are declaring that PushString_i will be implementing all
the pure virtual functions defined in _sk_PushString (we have
defined only one), by inheriting from the skeleton.
</p><p>In <a href="3201l4.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
4</b></span></a> (PushString_i.C), we actually go about the
task of defining the implementation of the interface defined in the
PushString.idl file. We will, of course, implement our constructor
and destructor, but we will also give a real body to our virtual
pushStr function. We do this with the definition of the
function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CORBA::Boolean PushString_i::pushStr(
      const char * inStr)
   throw(CORBA::SystemException)
{
   int retval;
   cerr &lt;&lt; "in PushStr\n";
   char * m_str = new char[strlen(inStr)+1];
   strcpy(m_str,inStr);
   // just for fun, mess with the boolean return
   if( strlen(m_str) &gt; 5 )
      retval = 1;
   else
      retval = 0;
   cout &lt;&lt; "The string pushed was "
        &lt;&lt; m_str &lt;&lt; endl;
   delete [] m_str;
   cerr &lt;&lt; "Implementation leaving PushStr..."
        &lt;&lt; endl;
   return(retval);
}
</pre><p>Here, when the client calls the pushStr function, passing it
a string (notice the IDL string type has been mapped in C++ to a
<b  >const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*</b>), the function prints out
a message letting us know we're in the implementation. It then
copies the incoming string into a local buffer, checks to see if
the length of the incoming string is greater than 5, and if so,
sets the function's Boolean return value to 1; otherwise, it sets
the return value to 0. Then, pushStr prints out the string that was
copied, deletes it, and notifies us we are now leaving the
implementation. At that point, we return to the client the Boolean
<span   class="bold"><b>retval</b></span> created earlier.
</p><p>In <a href="3201l5.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
5</b></span></a> (Client.C), we see the client code. The first
thing we do when we enter the Client.C code is open the ior.out
file the server created, which contains the IOR of the server's
object implementation. The client expects this file to be in its
current working directory. Once that file has been opened and the
IOR stored in the variable &ldquo;IOR&rdquo;, the client code begins to look
reminiscent of the code in the Srv_Main.C file. Namely, the same
calls to initialize the ORB and the BOA take place, with the same
parameters.</p><p>Then, we create a variable of type PushString_var. The type
PushString_var is essentially a helper type that provides the stub
capabilities for marshaling and unmarshaling parameters. It also
provides other essential functions such as releasing and
duplicating object references, along with functions for determining
whether a particular object reference is empty (null) or not.
Essentially, the PushString_var type stands as a proxy within the
Client's process space for the real implementation of the
PushString object, which may be miles away across the
network.</p><p>After pushStringVar is created, we enter a try/catch block
that calls the ORB and asks it to translate the string IOR (which
we obtained from the ior.out file created by the server) into an
actual object reference. The object reference created here,
however, is of type <b  >CORBA::Object_var</b>, a generic
type. In order to actually make a call against that object's
interface, we must &ldquo;downcast&rdquo; it into the actual type of object
it represents and for which we have an implementation. This is done
through a call to a function named
<span   class="bold"><b>narrow</b></span>, defined in the Abstract
Base Class for the stub PushString (defined in PushStringSK.cc).
Once the generic type has been resolved to an actual interface
implementation, we can then make calls on that interface. This is
done with the call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pushStringVar-&gt;pushStr(src);
</pre><p>This makes a call to the remote object's implementation,
passing in a string that contains simply the phrase &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo;. At that point, given no exceptions were thrown during the
try block, the client notifies us it has completed the call without
an exception and terminates.
</p><p>Finally, you might be wondering whether it is always
necessary to pass IORs around via files. The answer is certainly
not, but because omniORB does not have its own proprietary bind
mechanism (which is how a simple example like this would be
implemented in VisiBroker or Orbix), the only way to get the client
talking to the server object without using the Naming Service is
through an IOR passed in to the client by the server. In a future
article on CORBA services, we will show how the CORBA naming
service can be used to obtain an object reference through nothing
more than a name (which looks much like an absolute path name in
UNIX). With the naming service in place, we will no longer need to
pass IORs from the server to the client.</p><p>In our next article, we will be talking about CORBA on Linux
using VisiBroker for Java, implementing in Java. We will also have
a much more complicated example in our article on CORBA services,
where we will offer an example that utilizes the Naming Service, as
well as a factory which creates objects on behalf of the
client.</p><p><a href="3201s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
