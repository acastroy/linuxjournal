    An introduction to MMX and how to take advantage of its
    capabilities in your program.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1765580.0x185d4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Commercially introduced in January 1997,
the MMX technology is an extension of the Intel architecture that
uses a single-instruction, multiple-data execution model that
allows several data elements to be processed simultaneously.
Applications that benefit from the MMX technology are those that do
many parallelizable computations using small integer numbers.
Examples of these kinds of applications are 2-D/3-D graphics, image
processing, virtual reality, audio synthesis and data compression.
</p><p>If your Linux system has a Pentium II or a Pentium with MMX
technology, you can build programs that take advantage of the MMX
instruction set using <span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> and a
bit of assembly language. In this article, I will briefly introduce
the main features of the MMX technology, explain how to detect
whether an x86 microprocessor has built-in MMX capabilities and
show how to program a simple image processing application.</p><p>The assembly language code presented here uses NASM, the
Netwide Assembler. NASM employs the standard Intel syntax instead
of the AT&amp;T syntax used on many popular UNIX assemblers, such
as GAS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1765580.0x185d6b8"></a>MMX Programming Environment</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3244f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MMX Register Set
</p></div></div><p>The MMX technology extends the Intel architecture by adding
eight 64-bit registers and 57 instructions. The new registers are
named MM0 to MM7 (see Figure 1). Depending on which instructions we
use, each register may be interpreted as one 64-bit quadword, two
packed 32-bit double words, four packed 16-bit words, or eight
packed 8-bit bytes (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3244f2.large.jpg"><img src="3244f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MMX Data Types
</p></div></div><p>The MMX instruction set comprises several categories of
instructions, including those for arithmetic, logical, comparison,
conversion and data transfer operations.</p><p>The syntax for MMX instructions is similar to other x86
instructions:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
OP Destination, Source
</pre><p>This line is interpreted as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Destination = Destination OP Source
</pre>


Except for the data transfer instructions, the destination operand
must always be any MMX register. The source operand can be a datum
stored in a memory location or in an MMX register. A few specific
MMX instructions will be discussed further on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1765580.0x185dce8"></a>Detecting MMX Processors</h2></div></div><p>Before running a program that uses MMX instructions, it is
important to make sure your microprocessor actually has MMX
support. Your Linux system should be an Intel x86 or compatible
microprocessor (386, 486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium II, or any
of the Cyrix or AMD clones). This is easily checked by executing
the <b  >uname -m</b> command. This command should return
i386, i486, i586 or i686. If it does not, your Linux system runs on
a non-x86 architecture.</p><p>In order to determine if your CPU supports MMX technology,
use the assembly language CPUID instruction. This instruction
reveals important processor information, such as its vendor,
family, model and cache information. Unfortunately, the CPUID
instruction is present only on some late 80486 processors and
above. So, how do you know if CPUID is available on your system?
Intel documents the following trick: if your program can modify bit
21 of the EFLAGS register, then the CPUID instruction is available;
otherwise, you are working with an aged CPU. See Listing 1 (lines
12-29) to learn how this can be done.</p><p><a href="3244l1.html" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Listing
1.</b></span></a></p><p>Next, request CPU feature information by putting a value of 1
in the EAX register and executing the instruction. The resulting
value is returned in bit 23 of the EDX register. If this bit is on,
the processor supports the MMX instruction set; otherwise, it does
not. Listing 1 (lines 43-50) shows how to do this.</p><p>Programs should contain two versions of the same routine: one
using MMX technology and one using regular scalar code. At runtime,
the program can decide which routine it should actually
call.</p><p>If MMX instructions are executed in a system that does not
support them, the CPU will raise an &ldquo;invalid opcode exception&rdquo;
(interrupt vector number 6) which is trapped by the Linux kernel.
The Linux kernel in turn sends an &ldquo;illegal instruction signal&rdquo;
(code number 4) to the offending process. By default, this action
terminates the program and generates a core file.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3244f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Original Gray-Scale Image
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1765580.0x185e268"></a>An Image Brightening Program</h2></div></div><p>Let's suppose we have a gray-scale bitmap image, like the one
in Figure 3. Each pixel is stored in one unsigned 8-bit byte
contained in an array. Smaller numbers represent darker tones of
gray, while larger numbers represent brighter tones. Numbers 0 and
255 represent the pure black and white colors, respectively. For
the sake of code simplicity, the images employed in this program
(see Listing 2 in the archive file) use Microsoft Windows'
gray-scale BMP file format. John Bradley's
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span> utility can easily be used
under Linux to create and display this kind of bitmap image.</p><p>To make the image brighter, we just need to add a positive
integer (let's say 64 hexadecimal) to each of its pixels. In C, we
would have something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define BRIGHTENING_CONSTANT 0x64
unsigned char bitmap[BITMAP_SIZE];
size_t i;
/* Load image somehow ... */
for(i = 0; i &lt; BITMAP_SIZE; i ++)
  bitmap[i] += BRIGHTENING_CONSTANT;
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3244f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Brightened Image Using Wraparound Arithmetic
</p></div></div><p>Unfortunately, we end up with the undesired image found in
Figure 4. This happens because of wraparound; if the result of the
addition overflows (i.e., exceeds 255, which is the upper unsigned
8-bit byte limit), the result is truncated so that only the lower
(least significant) bits are considered. For example, adding 100
(64 hexadecimal) to a pixel value of 250 (almost pure white) gives
the result shown below.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
    250 decimal       11111010 binary
  + 100 decimal    +  01100100 binary
  -------------    ------------------
  = 350 decimal    = 101011110 binary   Overflow
                                        produced
  =  94 decimal    =  01011110 binary   Take the 8
                            least significant bits
</pre><p>The result is 94 which produces a darker gray instead of a
brighter one, causing the observable inversion effect.
</p><p>What we require is that whenever an addition exceeds the
maximum limit, the result should <span   class="emphasis"><em>saturate</em></span>
(clipped to a predefined data-range limit). In this case, the
saturation value is 255, which represents pure white. The following
C fragment takes care of saturation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int sum;
for(i = 0; i &lt; BITMAP_SIZE; i ++)
  {
  sum = bitmap[i] + BRIGHTENING_CONSTANT;
  /* UCHAR_MAX is defined in &lt;limits.h&gt;
   * and is equal to 255u */
  if(sum &gt; UCHAR_MAX)
    bitmap[i] = UCHAR_MAX;
  else
    bitmap[i] = (unsigned char) sum;
  }
</pre><p>Now we obtain the image shown in Figure 5, which is
brightened as we wanted.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3244f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Brightened Image Using Saturation Arithmetic
</p></div></div>

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3244f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Unsigned Byte-Packed Addition with Saturation
</p></div></div>

</p><p>MMX technology allows us to do this saturated arithmetic
addition on eight unsigned bytes in parallel using just one
instruction: <b  >paddusb</b>. Figure 6 shows an example
of how this instruction works. Our image-brightening algorithm (see
Listing 1, starting at line 61) can be described as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Pack the same brightening constant byte eight times
into the MM0 register (line 66).</p></li><li><p>Repeat bitmap-size / 8 times:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Copy the next eight bytes from the bitmap array
into the MM1 register (line 74).</p></li><li><p>Add the eight packed unsigned bytes contained in
MM0 to the eight packed unsigned bytes in MM1. Use saturation (line
75).</p></li><li><p>Copy the result of the MM1 register back to the
bitmap array from where it was originally taken (line 76).</p></li><li><p>Advance bitmap array index register (line
77).</p></li></ol></div>

</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b  >movq</b> MMX instruction used in steps 1
and 3 copies 64 bits from the source operand to the destination
operand.
</p><p>Whenever we finish executing MMX instructions, the
<b  >emms</b> instruction (Listing 1, line 81) should be
used to clear the MMX state. This is an important issue, especially
if any floating-point instructions follow in our program. In order
to make the MMX technology compatible with existing operating
systems and applications, Intel engineers decided the MMX registers
should share the same physical space with the floating-point
registers. This was considered necessary because, for example, in a
multi-tasking operating system such as Linux, whenever a task
switch occurs, the running process must have its state preserved in
order to be resumed some time in the future. This state
preservation involves copying all of the CPU's registers into
memory. If you add more registers to the CPU, you must also modify
the operating system code that takes care of saving the registers.
However, if your new registers are aliased to existing registers,
no change is required in the code.</p><p>Unfortunately, this workaround in the case of MMX and
floating-point registers has a major drawback: you cannot use both
types of registers at the same time, simply because they represent
two very different types of data. The general rule is you cannot
mix MMX and floating-point instructions in the same portions of
code. Therefore, the <b  >emms</b> instruction is the
mechanism of informing the CPU that future floating-point
instructions are allowed in the program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1765580.0x1855c28"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Is all this worth the trouble? The answer to this question
depends on the importance you give to speed. Comparing the MMX
example program to a pure C language version, the speed
improvements speak for themselves. The MMX routine is roughly 14
times faster than the C version (Listing 2 in the archive file)
when compiled with no optimizations and about five times faster
when full <b  >-O2</b> optimizations are enabled. Of
course, you will lose portability and will probably have a harder
time writing and debugging assembly language code. Life's full of
tough choices, isn't it?</p><p><a href="3244s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
