    Mr. Dinsel tells us how his former college is using Linux as
    a web server and teaching tool.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1939580.0x1a313f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Nestled along the banks of the
Monongahela river of western Pennsylvania rests California
University of Pennsylvania, a college engulfed in the world of
Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 3.11 and the old age of Vax. Yet new
hopes arise for a productive network of powerful servers and real
world applications that don't cause the budget to keel over and
die.
</p><p>Until recently, the Math and Computer Science department was
without its own server. The faculty had to rely on other
departments for a storage utility for software. Methods for
teaching classes about the World Wide Web and the Internet were
limited to the amount of help other departments could offer.
Creating and maintaining departmental web pages was a difficult
task&mdash;creation was done on an individual's machine, copied to disk
and given to the public relations office for uploading. These tasks
were not only tedious, but also inconsistently available and relied
heavily on the schedule of other departments.</p><p>Several solutions were available for the department. It could
deal with the situation as it was, or sacrifice a good chunk of the
budget by acquiring an NT server. As politics sometimes dictate,
the University departments and staff are governed by a guideline or
trend in the computing industry where the only options visible to
them are the ones being put into place in other locations on
campus. With NT on the rise throughout the campus, the department
felt that changes would have to wait, as the money for a machine
capable of running NT (not to mention added software costs to make
it perform the required tasks) was not in the budget.</p><p>Linux had been taking the world, and the author, by storm for
a few years. Unfortunately, the computing community is sometimes
blind to inexpensive alternatives such as a free operating system.
For the last few years, new software has meant new hardware because
programs were getting larger and more memory intensive. The
consumer has been eased into accepting this as a fact of life, so
much so that when they aren't required to spend money on upgrading,
they feel uncomfortable. Convincing people that &ldquo;free&rdquo; is not a
sign of poor quality can be quite a challenge.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1939580.0x1a31608"></a>Solutions</h2></div></div><p>After months of discussions and meetings, the Math and
Computer Science department and computer center agreed to give
Linux a try. Even though Linux had appeared in other locations on
campus, the department heads were still reluctant. Fortunately, a
mid-grade 486 machine was available on the department floor.
Because of the availability of an &ldquo;older&rdquo; machine, and the
excellent quality of Linux software, the budget was not affected
since there was no need for a a hardware upgrade. Linux is content
to run on yesterday's hardware.</p><p>As a stepping stone into the world of non-traditional
computing, a web server was set up initially for use by the
department. Because of strict computing policies and the thin ice
the project started out on, only faculty members were given
accounts on the server.</p><p>The department now had a place to hold their web pages, that
also allowed easy access for updating and maintaining them. CGI,
server side includes (SSI) and other web page tricks could be
utilized by the departmental web pages, because the department now
had control over security on the server. Previously, security
policies were defined by outside forces, and web pages were limited
to basic hypertext tags.</p><p>Linux was proving its worth. The uptime on the server had
surpassed the typical operating cycle on the NT servers. With
continued discussion and meetings, other possible uses of the
server became apparent.</p><p>The university offers a course that introduces students to
the World Wide Web, the Internet and Windows (typically 3.11 and
NT). Before the existence of the Linux server, the department was
limited by its dependency on other departments, and so could not
offer a very well-rounded view of the topics. Students were limited
in what they could do with their web pages, and Internet/Intranet
working skills were weak.</p><p>Using the Linux server, anonymous FTP (uploading and
downloading) became available. The lab assignments could now be
placed on the server for students to retrieve individually.
Essential software packages (that have a tendency to be broken or
removed from the workstations) could be placed in a Samba directory
for students or professors to access and reinstall.</p><p>With the advent of Linux, labs ran more smoothly and students
had the potential to learn more because of the dynamic and powerful
tools Linux has to offer. At the same time, campus policies
regarding student web pages and computer security could be upheld.
The use of TCP wrappers, <span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>
configuration and IP firewalling can limit access to web pages,
shares, FTP and more. Thus, students' access to the server was
limited to inside the University domain.</p><p>All of these tasks were accomplished without weeks of waiting
for another department to find the time to implement requests from
the Math and Computer Science department, and without tying up
valuable space on the campus NT servers. Linux has proven its worth
and reliability to the department: new ideas and uses for the
server are discovered and pursued weekly. Most of all, the fear of
not being able to afford software solutions has disappeared.</p><p>Building a place for Linux on campus has been an ongoing
struggle. With persistence, and the backing of the Linux community
(through excellent software and boundless innovation), there is no
stopping the powerful force of Linux.</p></div></div>
