    Not all networking software is based on BSD sockets. System V
    UNIX
    systems and most commercial networking code use STREAMS. The LiS
    project was developed to make STREAMS available for Linux, with the
    aim of making Linux the best UNIX platform for developing, debugging
    and using STREAMS software.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ffcbe0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The input/output system in UNIX is far
from simple and involves many different modules: networking
involves different protocol stages arranged in protocol stacks;
terminal I/O involves different &ldquo;line disciplines&rdquo; stacked over
(perhaps network) devices. All those modules perform some
processing on existing I/O data flows.
</p><p>In Linux and most BSD systems, I/O modules live inside the
kernel and the relations between them are more or less hard-wired
into the code. As an example, the TCP/IP protocol stack is a
carefully programmed set of modules with strong interrelations. It
is designed to work well on typical configurations.</p><p>STREAMS is a flexible input/output system, initially designed
to overcome the inflexibility found in previous UNIX systems (see
Resources 1). It is an alternative to sockets and is used in most
commercial UNIX versions. Some sort of STREAMS is needed if we ever
want networking software from systems such as Solaris, Unixware,
etc. to run off-the-shelf on Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ffcd98"></a>STREAM Definition</h2></div></div><p>A STREAM (see Figure 1) is, in essence, a dynamically
configurable stack of modules. Each module does some processing on
a data flow as it goes from the device to the user or vice-versa.
The user perceives a STREAM as a file. It is handled with the usual
<span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span> system calls. Data written
by the user is packaged into messages, which are sent downstream.
Data read by the user comes from messages sent upstream by an
underlying device driver.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3086f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Components of a STREAM
</p></div></div><p>A couple of additional system calls,
<span   class="bold"><b>putpmsg</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>getpmsg</b></span>, allow the user to send
and receive STREAMS messages directly. Yet another system call,
<span   class="bold"><b>poll</b></span>, provides an alternate
interface for <span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span>. Therefore,
each STREAM is composed of these elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A mandatory <span   class="emphasis"><em>STREAM head</em></span> talks
to the user process doing I/O. The head fills the gap between user
system calls and the message flow. Thus, a write into the STREAM is
handled by the head by sending a message downstream. Conversely, a
data message going upstream is used by the head to service read
system calls on the STREAM.</p></li><li><p>A (possibly empty) stack of STREAM modules
typically performs some computation on messages passing by and
forwards them either upstream or downstream. For example, IP on
X.25 encapsulation (IXE) could be implemented as a STREAMS module;
IP packets would be (de)encapsulated as they pass by the IXE
module. A terminal-line-discipline module is another example; typed
characters can be <span   class="emphasis"><em>cooked</em></span> as they cross the
line-discipline module. A packet-sniffer module could thus be used
as a diagnostic or debugging tool.</p></li><li><p>A mandatory STREAM driver interconnects the STREAM
to the device sitting below it. STREAM drivers can also be software
only; for example, a STREAMS driver could be used to implement an
SNMP MIB for the kernel, or a driver could be written to emulate
the behaviour of a true hardware driver for development
purposes.</p></li></ul></div><p>A nice property of STREAMS is that different modules (or
drivers) can be decoupled quite easily. Hence, they could be
developed independently by different people who don't know the
actual protocol stack where they will be used, provided the
interfaces between the various modules and drivers are
well-defined. STREAMS includes standard interfaces for the
transport, network and data link layers. In addition, modules can
be dynamically &ldquo;pushed&rdquo; onto (and popped off) the STREAM, which
is a very convenient feature.
</p><p>Finally, special <span   class="emphasis"><em>multiplexor</em></span> drivers
allow several STREAMS to be multiplexed into another one (or ones).
The <span   class="bold"><b>ip</b></span> module in Figure 2 is a
multiplexor. In this example, it multiplexes both TCP and IP
messages using either an Ethernet driver or an IP-on-X.25 driver. A
full STREAMS network can be built (see Figure 2), and many
different protocol stacks can be set up dynamically for
operation.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3086f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ffd9f8"></a>The LiS Project</h2></div></div><p>Before Linux was available, Dennis M. Ritchie designed
STREAMS for the ninth edition of UNIX (see Resources 5). Since
then, the STREAMS concept has been improved and revised by
different operating systems. Variants ranging from UNIX SVR4
STREAMS (see Resources 1) to Plan 9 Streams (see Resources 3) exist
today.</p><p>Unfortunately, SVR4 complicated the neat and clean design of
the ninth edition's STREAMS mainly to add new features, such as
atomic gather/scatter writes and multiprocessor support. Different
devices such as pipes and fifos were also re-implemented using
STREAMS (see Figure 3).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3086f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A STREAMS-Based Pipe
</p></div></div><p>Despite being far more complex than Ritchie's Streams, SVR4
STREAMS simplify the construction of network software. Indeed, most
networking software for UNIX System V machines is written using
STREAMS (including the socket interface). We wanted to be able to
run SVR4 driver software under Linux.</p><p>After some of us independently started to develop what would
become LiS, we met on c.o.l.a. and decided to coordinate our
efforts. An LiS project, LSM, was posted in March 1995 and the
project began.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff4650"></a>To STREAM or Not to STREAM</h2></div></div><p>There are several reasons to use STREAMS: standard service
interfaces to different layers (DLPI for the data link layer, NPI
for the network layer and TPI for the transport layer), flexibility
and SVR4 compatibility.</p><p>What we like about STREAMS under SVR4 is we can write device
drivers conforming to a powerful but not Byzantine API (DLPI or
TPI, in particular) and have existing network services (DLPI) or
existing &ldquo;applications&rdquo; (read <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-kernel
code</em></span>) work with the device with no additional
effort.</p><p>Protocol stages (or modules) can be dynamically
added/removed. Imagine you are debugging a transport layer
interface (TLI) for X.25, and you can push and pop an
<b  >x25_tli</b> module many times. That is, it is an
open framework. Those modules employed can, of course, be shared
and reused in different places. With sockets, you have only what
the kernel has.</p><p>The bottom line is that standards are a &ldquo;Good Thing&rdquo;. In
the era of distributed systems, this applies equally to
kernel-level network and communication interfaces. The STREAMS
framework, APIs and service interfaces were designed by intelligent
people at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. The result is a mechanism which is
clean, comprehensive and elegant to boot.</p><p>It has been argued against STREAMS that they are too
complicated and too slow when compared to BSD sockets. A related
argument is that TCP/IP networking is done more efficiently with
BSD-style protocol stacks.</p><p>Consider this: Linux TCP/IP networking code can be used as-is
with LiS. The purpose of LiS is simply to have the STREAMS
framework available, not to replace the Linux TCP/IP protocol
stack. Existing network software is perceived by STREAMS users as
the dashed box in Figure 2. Fake modules interfacing with existing
Linux drivers and protocol stacks are all we need.</p><p>With respect to simplicity, STREAMS make certain things, such
as &ldquo;deep&rdquo; protocol stacks, more simple when compared to sockets.
Sockets were designed for implementing TCP/IP-type networking and,
although simple, are not <span   class="emphasis"><em>extensible</em></span>. That is,
you can't easily use the sockets mechanism to build deep protocol
stacks of which the sockets have no built-in knowledge. Each time
the Internet protocol suite needs another layer, some hack is
likely to be made to sockets.</p><p>The Internet protocol suites are deeper than the kernel
implementors like to think they are. Consider TCP/IP when IP is
sent using X.25 packets, transmitted with LAPB frames through a
driver. Now you have a TCP/IP &lt;-&gt; X.25 &lt;-&gt; LAPB
&lt;-&gt; driver stack. Then add another protocol over TCP/IP (say,
NFS) and interpose frame relay (FR). The stack becomes: NFS
&lt;-&gt; TCP/IP &lt;-&gt; X.25 &lt;-&gt; LAPB &lt;-&gt; FR
&lt;-&gt; driver. Sockets are not equipped to build protocol stacks
such as these that were not originally designed into it. It can be
done, but is much easier and cleaner with STREAMS.</p><p>SVR4 STREAMS and LiS are much more complex than ninth edition
STREAMS, but the added complexity is mostly to the STREAMS
implementation and is hidden from the driver or module
programmer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff4b20"></a>Let the STREAM Flow Free</h2></div></div><p>Most UNIX features have been available in source form for
people to read and use. STREAMS was a notable exception. Therefore,
even though we could have designed LiS to support just the STREAMS
interface, we also tried to follow its design. If SVR4 STREAMS code
had been available, the project could have been reduced to a simple
port. As a result, the design guide was a mixture of a couple of
books showing how STREAMS work (see Resources 2 and 4).</p><p>Availability of source code for the Linux kernel was crucial,
as LiS requires small changes to existing kernel subsystems.</p><p>Starting from scratch, our aim was to make LiS portable so
that other people could avoid rewriting it for use on different
systems. By replacing a single small module, the whole framework
can be ported to different operating systems. LiS portability is
demonstrated by the fact that Gcom has ported it to QNX (a UNIX
flavor). Ports for BSD UNIX system and even NT could be done
without much effort in the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff4cd8"></a>LiS Features and Implementation</h2></div></div><p>A complete STREAMS description would be too large for this
article. Some books you might read to learn more about STREAMS can
be found in Resources. In a few words, LiS features include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>support for typical STREAMS modules and
drivers</p></li><li><p>ability to use binary-only drivers</p></li><li><p>convenient debugging facilities</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff5048"></a>Typical STREAMS Facilities</h2></div></div><p>Many similarities exist between the implementation of LiS and
SVR4 STREAMS. This is because initial project members followed the
&ldquo;Magic Garden&rdquo; (see Resources 2) as a design guideline. Current
maintainers were also heavily influenced by SVR4 STREAMS, because
they had been writing STREAMS drivers for SVR4 since 1990. Thus,
the stream head structure, queue structure, message structure,
etc., follow the SVR4 model.</p><p>Differences between the two do exist. SVR4 disallows STREAMS
multiplexors to use the same driver at more than one level of the
stack. For example, if we had a STREAMS multiplexor driver called
&ldquo;DLPI&rdquo; and another called &ldquo;NPI&rdquo;, the SVR4 STREAMS would
disallow the stack: NPI(SNA) &lt;-&gt; DLPI(QLLC) &lt;-&gt;
NPI(X.25) &lt;-&gt; DLPI(LAPB). LiS allows these combinations,
since we could see no harm in such configurations.</p><p>The configuration file used for LiS is modeled after the SVR4
<span   class="emphasis"><em>sdevice</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>mdevice</em></span>
files. However, LiS syntax is different and combines into a single
file the functions that SVR4 used two files to specify. The LiS
build process (Makefiles) allow individual drivers to have their
own config file. They all get combined into one master config file,
which is then used to configure LiS at build time.</p><p>In SVR4, the STREAMS executive is a linkable package for the
kernel. It is not hard-wired into the kernel. With LiS, the STREAMS
executive is actually a runtime, loadable module of the kernel, one
step more dynamic than SVR4 STREAMS.</p><p>A quick overview of the LiS implementation would reveal a
STREAM as a full-duplex chain of modules (see Figure 4). Each one
consists of a queue pair: one for data being read and another one
for data being written. Each module has several data structures
providing those operations (i.e., functions) needed, as well as
statistics and other data.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3086f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Queues in a STREAM
</p></div></div><p>Module operations are provided by the programmer and include
procedures used to process upstream and downstream messages.
Messages can be queued for deferred processing, as LiS guarantees
to call service procedures when queued messages could be
processed.</p><p>Most of the LiS implementation deals with these queues and
also with the message data structures used to send data through the
STREAM. Messages carry a type code and are made of one or more
message blocks. Only pointers to messages are passed from one
module to the next, so there is no data copy overhead.</p><p>The head of the STREAM is another interesting piece of
software. In Figure 5, you can see how it is reached from the Linux
VFS (Virtual File System) layer which interfaces the kernel with
the file systems. Note that even though Linux does not have a clean
and isolated VFS layer, Linux i-nodes are v-nodes in spirit and its
file system layer can be considered to be a VFS. For an actual
description of the implementation, read Chapter 7 of the &ldquo;Magic
Garden&rdquo; (Resources 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3086f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The STREAM Head
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff57d8"></a>Binary-Only Drivers</h2></div></div><p>LiS also makes provision for linking with binary-only
drivers. This allows companies such as Gcom which have proprietary
drivers to port their driver code to LiS and distribute binaries.
This is an important feature if we expect companies to port their
existing SVR4 STREAMS drivers to LiS. The more of these available,
the more the Linux kernel functionality is enhanced.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff58e0"></a>Debug Facilities</h2></div></div><p>LiS debugging features are especially convenient and show
another departure point from SVR4.</p><p>Of course, these facilities include some general-purpose
debug utilities such as message printers, but also included are
significant aids that can really help with debugging, such as the
ability to selectively trace; for example,
<span   class="bold"><b>getmsg</b></span> calls.</p><p>The memory allocator keeps file and line numbers close to
allocated memory areas. Combine that with the ability to print out
all the in-use memory areas, and you have a tool for finding memory
leaks in your drivers.</p><p>Usage statistics are designed to help, not overload the user
with unnecessary information. The
<span   class="bold"><b>streams</b></span> command prints out a good
deal of useful information about LiS operation. There is even a
debug bitmap to cause LiS to trigger different debug facilities.
One of them is the ability to time various operations using the
high-resolution timer. Thus, the user can get fine-grain driver
timings for those drivers using LiS tools with no extra code in the
driver.</p><p>Last but not least, LiS allows module debugging in user space
by emulating the whole STREAMS framework. A module can be easily
developed in user space and then downloaded into the kernel when it
works. That is achieved by a &ldquo;port&rdquo; of LiS which runs in user
space on Linux (in a dummied-up manner).</p><p>STREAMS modules can be tested by surrounding them with test
modules and then driving known sequences of messages through the
module under test. The LiS loop driver is suitable to place below
the driver being tested, as it behaves like a simple echo server.
The stream head may very well be all that is needed above.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff5c50"></a>STREAMS Works with Linux TCP/IP</h2></div></div><p>The whole TCP/IP stack can be reused; thus, TCP/IP
performance with STREAMS is a non-issue. LiS comes with an adapter
driver that fits below standard Linux IP and interfaces off to
STREAMS drivers using DLPI. Gcom uses this to interface their
STREAMS-based Frame Relay and (soon) X.25.</p><p>Also, a contributed driver that will be distributed with LiS
(sitting in Dave's inbox as of this writing) sits on top of any
Linux MAC (mandatory access control) driver as a client and
presents a DLPI interface above. Gcom will probably use this driver
to interface its SNA (system network architecture) to the Linux
token-ring driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff5db0"></a>LiS Licensing</h2></div></div><p>LiS is licensed using the GNU Library Public License so that
companies can port their existing SVR4 proprietary STREAMS drivers
to LiS and use them in Linux without having to publish their source
code. This is important if we are to encourage companies to support
Linux with their &ldquo;family jewels&rdquo; products.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f04580.0x1ff5eb8"></a>Final LiS Needs</h2></div></div><p>It would help if support needed to run LiS could be included
in the mainstream kernel. We are referring mainly to the new system
calls and other small <span   class="emphasis"><em>hooks</em></span>, not to LiS
itself. This support would make it easier for people to download
LiS and install it without having to patch the kernel.</p><p><a href="3086s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
