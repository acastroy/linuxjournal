Who can keep up? Not I, that's for sure. Since I started this
column a few months ago, many of the applications I've written
about have been updated. This is always nice to see. Many packages
I haven't highlighted have also been updated, so if you've
downloaded something and like it, you might want to check back now
and then for upgrades.
</p><p>Many of these packages are maintained by one or a few
authors. Drop them a line, be encouraging, mention breaks and
problems, and suggest improvements (don't be surprised if they
aren't implemented). Let them know you use the program and
appreciate their work. Programmers always welcome bug reports,
particularly detailed ones that make it easy to track and fix the
error (be sure you can reproduce it). If you can code, offer
help.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>QuickPlanning:</b></span> http://devplanet.fastethernet.net/files.html#QuickPlanning</p><p>QuickPlanning cannot truly be called a planner. It is more of
a &ldquo;tickler&rdquo; to remind you what to do or what you did on a certain
date. It built easily, but could use an INSTALL file containing a
hint or two about what other things should be done. The first time
I ran it and tried to save an entry, it aborted with a segmentation
fault. A quick <span   class="bold"><b>strace</b></span> showed that
it wanted to write to the directory $HOME/.qp/ which didn't exist.
You must first create this file, until such a time as the author
includes code to take care of it. Also, you must verify that any
date you want to use actually exists. The program was happy to let
me save data for 30 Feb 1999. For a program the author hacked
together in 30 minutes, it works well. Libraries required are
gtk-1.1.13, libXext.so.6, libX11.so.6, libm.so.6 and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tictactoe:</b></span> http://www.forged.net/~blue/</p><p>For those who actually like to play tic-tac-toe, this version
can be played over a network. It is a simple SVGA game that allows
two players to bore each other to death for hours. (Does anyone
over the age of three ever lose this game?) It will drive
mathematicians in the crowd crazy since it uses row,column notation
rather than an x,y coordinate notation. Lawyers (or those who just
like to read licenses) will get a kick out of the license the
author wrote for this program. Libraries required are Perl 5 and
IO::Socket.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gTick:</b></span> http://www.bsenet.cjb.net/gtick</p><p>Are you a musician looking for a cheap metronome? Well, turn
on <span   class="bold"><b>gtick</b></span> and let it tick, tick,
tick away to help you keep the beat. Or, turn it on to annoy
everyone else in the room&mdash;after a while, they will ask &ldquo;What
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> that noise?&rdquo; A volume control is available
as well as the choice of emphasizing timing beats: none, every
other, every third or every fourth beat. Libraries required are
gtk-1.1.13, libXext.so.6, libX11.so.6, libm.so.6 and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ganesha:</b></span> http://www.frontiernet.net/~pani/downloads.html</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ganesha</b></span> displays the
round-trip time and number of hops of multiple input sites. I think
I need to turn it loose the next time I have a 10+ MB download to
do over my 56K modem. A quick run-through showed me the sites I
normally would favor are more hops and longer times away than a few
sites in the opposite direction. Since I am on the west coast of
the U.S., Japan is closer and faster than Europe. Now, if Japan has
mirrored the big programs I want, I will get them there.
<span   class="bold"><b>ganesha</b></span> is definitely a work in
progress, but the author has already identified the shortcomings,
so you should see some changes soon. Libraries required are
gtk-1.1.13, libXext-6, libX11-6, libm-6, libpthread, libnsl,
libdb-2, libgdbm-1, libcrypt and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Keystone:</b></span> http://www.stonekeep.com/keystone.php3</p><p>Keystone is another job-tracking application. Similar to the
program MOT, it has some of the same features and a few
differences. Which program is better is a matter of taste. They
accomplish much the same goal, just in a different manner. I found
Keystone a bit more difficult to set up than MOT, but once set up,
I saw little difference. The most difficult part of any program
which uses a web interface with php3 against a MySQL database is
compiling the ancillary applications (Apache, PHP3 and MySQL),
since each relies on the other. Libraries required are Apache with
php3 and MySQL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>grpn:</b></span> http://wilkins.ne.mediaone.net/grpn.html</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>grpn</b></span> is a calculator with
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), which I haven't used in a while.
Fortunately, this application has a nice help facility&mdash;it was a
needed and good refresher. <span   class="bold"><b>grpn</b></span> is
very nice&mdash;goodbye <span   class="bold"><b>xcalc</b></span>, it was
nice knowing you. Libraries required are gtk-1.1.13, libXext.so.6,
libX11.so.6, libm.so.6 and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>terraform:</b></span> http://www.peoplesoft.com/peoplepages/g/robert_gasch/terraform/</p><p>This is a very nice looking terraform program with the
ability to show a randomly generated area in several different
ways, including 2-D Plane, 3-D Wire, 3-D Height and 3-D Light. All,
even the 3-D light, ran fairly fast on my slow system. You can also
choose color bands, gray scale, desert and red hot&mdash;just a few of
the options. It is a nicely done application. Libraries required
are libgtkmm, libgdkmm, gtk+1.1.13, libXext, libX11,
libstdc++-libc6, libm and glibc.</p></div></div>
