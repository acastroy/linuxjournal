<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #128, December 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

After almost a year of rivalry, <span   class="bold"><b>pmdisk</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>swsusp</b></span>
will be re-unified into swsusp, and <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> will
continue to lead swsusp development, with help from
<span   class="bold"><b>Patrick Mochel</b></span> who did the fork and other folks
interested in the software suspend feature. Patrick
made a nice apology to Pavel for forking the code, and
the two have been working very nicely together since
then, sharing patches and conversing on the technical
issues. It's nice to see this dispute resolved,
because it all emerged from a shared passion to make
the code as good as it could be, to provide a solid
software suspend feature and to merge the work into the
official kernel with as little breakage as possible.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>cryptoloop</b></span> is very likely to be dropped from
2.6 unless <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> decides to wait to
remove the code in 2.7; either way, it seems clear
that cryptoloop is on the way out. The feature,
intended to allow the user to mount encrypted
filesystems over loopback, is apparently buggy and
unmaintained, as well as having significant security
problems. And as far as Andrew is concerned, it
is this security question that dooms cryptoloop.
Better to have no feature, he says, than a feature
that falsely claims to provide real security. The
argument, put forward by a number of developers, that
such major changes as removing a feature should never
occur in a stable series, is being heard, but it
seems that this may only delay the inevitable. Unless
someone steps up to maintain it and fix the security
holes, cryptoloop probably will not last much longer.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Reiser4</b></span> filesystem, a significant departure
from <span   class="bold"><b>Reiser3</b></span>, has been accepted into the
-mm kernel series (Andrew Morton's personal tree)
and appears to be on the fast-track for inclusion in
an official release. The Reiser folks are ecstatic
about this, as it tremendously widens the field
of users and thus, of bug reports.
Reiser4, with only the core
functionality submitted to Andrew, claims to be the
fastest filesystem in the Linux world. That claim may
involve quite a moving target, but undoubtedly this
new generation of filesystems is picking up speed
in general, which makes a huge difference to anyone
involved in disk-intensive operations.
</p><p>
Andrew Morton, as the 2.6 maintainer, has decided to question some recent
traditions, including the validity of having a stable and unstable kernel
series. Although his innovations may not be so extensive as to discard the
entire idea, he has stated that he feels it is in the realm of the
distributions to bring true stability to the kernel. The official kernel
sources, he says, should focus on speed and features as well as stability,
but not give stability the high pinnacle of importance that it has been
given for the past several major releases. There are many ways to think
about this, and it's important to remember that Andrew, Linus and the rest
always are modifying their development model in response to their own ideas
and the ideas of others. Perhaps the most optimistic way to look at Andrew's
current idea is as a way to expand the field of kernel development to
include the distributions as full-class members of the development process,
with stability as one of their primary aims.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DevFS</b></span>, having been at the center of one of the largest controversies in
Linux history, seems to be edging closer and closer toward finally leaving
the kernel. Andrew Morton has said that the 2.8 kernel certainly will not
have DevFS, and that the feature could be removed as early as mid-2005.
There always has been a push to keep DevFS in until its replacement,
<span   class="bold"><b>udev</b></span>,
could provide all the features DevFS provided. For all its faults, DevFS has
proven to be a tough feature to replace. <span   class="bold"><b>Richard
Gooch</b></span> put a tremendous
amount of work into it, and in spite of all the criticism he got from
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span> and others, his work
still has not been replaced, almost
two years after Richard abandoned the project and gave up on kernel
development entirely.

They are struggling with not so much open source, per se, but rather
they are no longer the low price solution. In the past Microsoft was the
low cost solution and Microsoft was then competing and attacking
expensive proprietary systems from below. Now for the first time the
tables are turned and it's Microsoft that's being attacked from below by
a lower price solution.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Battle for Wesnoth</em></span> is a 2-D, turn-based game, with
a sword-and-sorcery storyline, slick graphics and
music and a lot of levels. Your units gain experience
points and power, if you can keep them alive from
battle to battle. Occupying villages gives you the
ability to heal units and recruit more. Levels seem
to make an abrupt jump in difficulty from fighting a
few Orcs with allies and an umpteenth-level sorcerer
on your side up to trying to defeat two armies of the
undead with a handful of footpads and some fish-boys,
so it's a good thing you don't have to be good to
have some fun with this game.
