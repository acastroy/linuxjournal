Unionfs merges several directories into a single unified view. We
describe
applications of Unionfs and also interesting implementation aspects.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156e6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For ease of management, it can be useful to keep related but different sets of
files in separate locations. Users, however, often prefer to see these related
files together. In this situation, unioning allows administrators to keep
such files
separate physically, but to merge them logically into a single view. A
collection of merged directories is called a union, and each physical
directory is called a branch. As shown in Figure 1, Unionfs simultaneously
layers on top of several filesystems or on different directories within the
same filesystem. This layering technique is known as stacking (see the
on-line Resources for more on stacking). Unionfs
presents a filesystem interface to the kernel, and in turn Unionfs presents
itself as the kernel's VFS to the filesystems on which it stacks. Because Unionfs
presents a filesystem view to the kernel, it can be employed by any user-level
application or from the kernel by the NFS server. Because Unionfs intercepts
operations bound for lower-level filesystems, it can modify operations to
present the unified view. Unlike earlier stackable filesystems, Unionfs is a
true fan-out filesystem; it can access many underlying branches directly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7714f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A union consists of several underlying
branches, which can be of any filesystem type.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156e978"></a>
Unionfs Semantics and Usage</h2></div></div><p>
In Unionfs, each branch is assigned a precedence. A branch with a higher
precedence overrides a branch with a lower precedence. Unionfs operates on
directories. If a directory exists in two underlying branches, the
contents and attributes of the Unionfs directory are the combination of the
two lower directories. Unionfs automatically removes any duplicate directory
entries, so users are not confused by duplicated filenames or directories. If
a file exists in two branches, the contents and attributes of the Unionfs
file are the same as the file in the higher-priority branch, and the file in
the lower-priority branch is ignored.
</p><p>
As a concrete example, assume that we unify two directories, /Fruits and
/Vegetables:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /Fruits
Apple Tomato
$ ls /Vegetables
Carrots Tomato
$ cat /Fruits/Tomato
I am botanically a fruit.
$ cat /Vegetables/Tomato
I am horticulturally a vegetable.
</pre>
</p><p>
To use Unionfs, you first need to compile the Unionfs module and load it into
the kernel. Next, like any other filesystem, Unionfs is mounted. Unlike other
filesystems, Unionfs does not mount on top of a device; it mounts on top of
directories that are specified as a mount-time option. To create a union, we
mount Unionfs as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/Fruits:/Vegetables \
&gt; none /mnt/healthy

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156ebe0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this example, the mount option dirs tells Unionfs which directories make up the union.
Unionfs does not mount any device, so we use none as a placeholder. Finally,
/mnt/healthy is the location of the merged view. Now /mnt/healthy contains
three files: Apple, Carrots and Tomato. Because we specified /Fruits before
/Vegetables, /mnt/healthy/Tomato contains &ldquo;I am botanically a
fruit.&rdquo; If we
were to reverse the dirs= option, /mnt/healthy/Tomato would contain
&ldquo;I am
horticulturally a vegetable.&rdquo; (which agrees with the 1893 U.S. Supreme Court
ruling on the matter).
</p><p>
This process is recursive. If there were a subdirectory
of Fruits named Green that contained a file named Lime and a subdirectory of
Vegetables also named Green that contained a file named Lettuce, the
result would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /mnt/healthy
Apple Carrots Green/ Tomato
$ ls /mnt/healthy/Green
Lime Lettuce
</pre>
</p><p>
Unionfs can be applied in several ways. Simple examples include unifying home
directories from multiple servers or merging split ISO images to create a
unified view of a distribution. In a similar vein, Unionfs, with copy-on-write
semantics, can be used to patch CD-ROMs, for source code management or for
snapshotting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156eea0"></a>
Unified Home Directories</h2></div></div><p>
Often a single client machine mounts home directories from several
different NFS servers. Unfortunately, each server has a distinct mountpoint, which is inconvenient for users. It would be ideal if all home
directories were available from the same place (/home for example). Some
automounters use symbolic links to create the illusion of a union. With
Unionfs, these links are not necessary. The separate exported directories
simply can
be unified into a single view. Assume we have two filesystems, one
mounted on /alcid and the other mounted on /penguin. We can unify them into
/home as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/alcid,/penguin \
&gt; none /home

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156f000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now home directories from both /alcid and /penguin
are available from /home.
</p><p>
Unionfs supports multiple
read-write branches, so the user's files will not
migrate from one directory to another. This
contrasts with previous unioning systems, such as
BSD-4.4's Union Mounts, which generally supported
only a single read-write branch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156f1b8"></a>
Merging Distribution ISO Images</h2></div></div><p>
Most Linux distributions are available as both ISO images and also as individual
packages. ISO images are convenient because they can be burnt directly to
CD-ROMs, and you need to download and store only a few files. To
install to a machine over a network, however, you often need to have the individual
packages in a single directory. Using the loopback device, the ISO images can
be mounted on separate directories, but this layout is not suitable for a
network install because all files need to be located in a single tree. For
this reason, many sites maintain copies of both the ISO images and also the
individual package files, wasting both disk space and bandwidth and
increasing management efforts. Unionfs can alleviate this problem by virtually
combining the individual package directories from the ISO images.
</p><p>
In this example, we are mounting over two directories, /mnt/disc1 and
/mnt/disc2. The mount command is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/mnt/disc1,/mnt/disc2 \
&gt; none /mnt/merged-distribution

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156f370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now /mnt/merged-distribution can be exported using NFS or FTP for use in network
installs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156f478"></a>
Copy-on-Write Unions</h2></div></div><p>
In the previous example of the ISO images, all of the branches in the union
were read-only; hence, the union itself was read-only. Unionfs also can mix
read-only and read-write branches. In this case, the union as a whole is
read-write, and Unionfs uses copy-on-write semantics to give the illusion that
you can modify files and directories on read-only branches. This could be used
to patch a CD-ROM. If the CD-ROM is mounted on /mnt/cdrom, and an empty
directory is created in /tmp/cdpatch, then Unionfs can be mounted as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/tmp/cdpatch,/mnt/cdrom \
&gt; none /mnt/patched-cdrom

</pre>
</p><p>
When viewed through /mnt/patched-cdrom, it appears as though you can write to
the CD-ROM, but all writes actually will take place in /tmp/cdpatch. Writing
to read-only branches results in an operation called a copyup. When a
read-only file is opened for writing, the file is copied over to a
higher-priority branch. If required, Unionfs automatically creates any needed
parent directory hierarchy.
</p><p>
In this CD-ROM example, the lower-level filesystem enforces the
read-only permissions, and Unionfs respects them. In other situations, the
lower-level filesystem may indeed be read-write, but Unionfs should not
modify the branch. For example, you may have one branch that contains pristine
kernel sources and then use a separate branch for your local changes. Through
Unionfs, the pristine sources should be read-only, as the CD-ROM was in the
previous example. This can be accomplished by adding
=ro to a directory in
the dirs mount option. Assume that /home/cpw/linux is empty, and /usr/src/linux
contains a Linux kernel source tree. The following mount command makes Unionfs
behave as a source code versioning system:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o \
&gt; dirs=/home/cpw/linux:/usr/src/linux=ro \
&gt; none /home/cpw/linux-src

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156f6e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This example makes it appear as if an entire Linux source
tree exists in /home/cpw/linux-src, but any changes to that
source tree, such as changed source files or new object files, actually go to
/home/cpw/linux.
</p><p>
With a simple modification, we also can use an overlay mount. That is, we can
replace /home/cpw/ linux with the unified view:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o
&gt; dirs=/home/cpw/linux:/usr/src/linux=ro
&gt; none /home/cpw/linux

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156f898"></a>
Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
Most filesystem operations in Unionfs move from higher-priority branches to
lower-priority branches. For example, LOOKUP begins in the highest-priority
branch in which the parent exists and then moves to lower-priority branches.
During the lookup operation, Unionfs caches information for use in later
operations.
</p><p>
CREATE attempts to create files in the highest-priority branch where the
parent directory exists. The CREATE operation uses the cached lookup
information to operate directly on the appropriate branch, so in effect, it
moves from higher-priority branches to lower-priority branches.
</p><p>
Unionfs uses several techniques to provide the illusion of
modifying read-only branches, and at the same time, maintains normal UNIX
semantics. If there is an error while creating a file, error handling must
be performed. Error handling proceeds from lower-priority branches to
higher-priority branches. Starting in the highest-priority branch in
which the
parent exists, Unionfs attempts to create the file in each higher-priority
branch. Finally, if the operation fails in the highest-priority branch for the
whole union, then Unionfs returns an error to the user.
</p><p>
In contrast to CREATE, the UNLINK operation always proceeds from lower-priority branches
to higher-priority branches. Because the last underlying object to be UNLINKed
is the highest-priority object, the user-visible state is not modified until
the very end of Unionfs's UNLINK operation. The most complex situations to
handle are partial errors. If removing an intermediate file fails and Unionfs
simply removes the highest-priority file, a lower-priority file
becomes visible to the user. To handle these error conditions, Unionfs uses a
special high-priority file called a whiteout. If Unionfs encounters a
whiteout, it behaves as if the file does not exist in any lower-priority
branch. Internally, to create a whiteout for a file named F, Unionfs creates a
zero-length file named .wh.F. Getting back to UNLINK&mdash;if an intermediate
UNLINK has failed, instead of deleting the highest-priority file, Unionfs
renames the file to the corresponding whiteout name.
</p><p>
This careful ordering of operations has two effects. The first is that UNIX
semantics are maintained even in the face of errors or read-only branches. The
user-visible state isn't modified until the operation is attempted on the
highest-priority branch. The success or failure of the operation is determined
by the success or failure of this branch. Through the use of whiteouts, a file
can be deleted even if it exists on a read-only branch. The second effect is
that when no errors occur, files and directories tend to stay in the branches
where they were originally. This is important because one of the goals of
Unionfs is to keep the files in separate places.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x156fb58"></a>
File Deletion Semantics</h2></div></div><p>
By default, Unionfs attempts to delete all instances of a file (or directory)
in all branches; this mode is called DELETE_ALL. Aside from DELETE_ALL,
Unionfs also supports two more deletion modes, DELETE_WHITEOUT and
DELETE_FIRST. DELETE_WHITEOUT behaves like the default mode externally, but instead
of removing all files in the Union, a whiteout is created. This has the
advantage that the lower-priority files still are available through the
underlying filesystem. DELETE_FIRST departs from classical UNIX semantics. It
only removes the highest-priority entry in the union and, thus, allows the
lower-priority entries to show through. These modes also are used for the
RENAME operation, as it is a combination of a create followed by a delete.
</p><p>
DELETE_FIRST requires some user knowledge of the union's components. This
is useful when Unionfs is used for source code versioning, as in our previous
example of a kernel source tree. If we change a file in /home/cpw/linux,
the file is copied up to the higher-priority branch. If the file is deleted
with standard DELETE_ALL semantics, Unionfs creates a whiteout in the
highest-priority branch (because it cannot modify the read-only
lower-priority branch). The original source file in the lower-priority branch
is now inaccessible, so it must be copied into the union from the source,
which hardly makes for a convenient versioning system. This situation is
precisely where DELETE_FIRST comes in handy. The delete mode is specified as a
mount option, as in the following example:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o \
&gt; dirs=/home/cpw/linux:/usr/src/linux=ro,\
&gt; delete=first none /home/cpw/linux

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x15665a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now, as before, if we change a file in /home/cpw/linux, the changes
don't affect /usr/src/ linux. If we decide we don't like the changes, we
simply
can remove the file and the original version will show through.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x15666a8"></a>
Unionfs Snapshots</h2></div></div><p>
With the unionctl utility, Unionfs's branch configuration can change on the
fly. New branches can be added anywhere in the union, branches can be
removed and read-write branches can be marked read-only (or vice versa). This
flexibility allows Unionfs to create filesystem snapshots. In this
example, we
use Unionfs to create a snapshot of /usr while installing a new package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mount -t unionfs -o dirs=/usr none /usr
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x1566808"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At this point, Unionfs has a single branch that is read-write, /usr. All
operations are passed to the lower-level filesystem, and it is as if Unionfs
didn't exist.
</p><p>
Creating a snapshot involves two steps. The first is to
specify the location of the snapshot files by adding a branch (say, /snaps/0),
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# unionctl /usr --add /snaps/0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x15669c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At this point, Unionfs creates new files for /usr in /snaps/0, but files in
subdirectories of /usr are created in the underlying /usr. The reason for this
seeming contradiction is the rule that files are created in the highest-priority branch where the parent exists. For files in the root directory of
the union, /usr, the parent exists in both branches. Because /snaps/0 is the
higher-priority branch, new files and directories are created physically in
/snaps/0. However, /snaps/0 is empty, so if a file were created in /usr/local, the highest-priority parent actually would be in the underlying
/usr branch.
</p><p>
To complete the migration, the original /usr branch needs to be
read-only. Again, we use unionctl to modify the branch configuration:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# unionctl /usr --mode /usr ro
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x1566b78"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now, because Unionfs thinks the underlying /usr is read-only, all write
operations really take place in /snaps/0. Multiple snapshots can be taken
simply by adding another branch, say, /snaps/1, and marking /snaps/0 as
read-only.
</p><p>
The first snapshot can be viewed through the underlying directory, /usr.
Each snapshot consists of a base directory and several directories that
have incremental differences. To view a specific snapshot, all we need is to
unify the first snapshot and the incremental changes. For example, to view the
snapshot that consists of /usr and /snaps/0, mount Unionfs as
follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# mount -t unionfs -o ro,dirs=/snaps/0:/usr \
&gt; none /mnt/snap

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x1566d30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this example, Unionfs itself is mounted read-only, so the underlying
directories are not modified.
</p><p>
After determining that the changes made in a snapshot are good, the next
step often is to merge the snapshot back into the base. The Unionfs distribution
includes a snapmerge script that applies incremental Unionfs snapshots to a
base directory. This is done by recursively copying the files in the snapshot
directory to the base. After the copy procedure is done, new files and changed
files are completed. The last step is to handle file deletions, which is done
by creating the list of whiteouts and deleting the corresponding files. The
whiteouts themselves also are removed so as not to clutter the tree.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1476580.0x1566e90"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Unionfs recursively merges several underlying directories or branches into a
single virtual view. The efficient fan-out structure of Unionfs makes it
suitable for many applications. Unionfs can be used to provide merged
distribution ISOs, a single /home namespace and more. Unionfs's copy-on-write
semantics make it useful for source code versioning, snapshotting and
patching CD-ROMs. We benchmarked Unionfs's performance under Linux 2.4. For a
compile benchmark with one to four branches, Unionfs overhead is only 12%.
For an I/O intensive workload, the overhead ranges from 10% for a single
branch to 12% for four branches.
