Combining the features of a content management system,
bulletin board, and on-line grade book, Moodle meets a
growing demand for on-line education.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf44500"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Currently, an explosion is occurring in the demand for distance education in the
US. Large numbers of high school graduates are going on to
college, and more adults are pursuing a college education. The
demographics of college students also are changing, with more
students juggling work and family responsibilities than ever before,
which necessitates
easier access to education. Furthermore, the changes in knowledge and
skills
catalyze the need for ongoing
professional development of the existing work force. In response, corporations
increasingly are turning to distance education options for their employees.
</p><p>
A learning management system (LMS) is a software system used to
deliver on-line education. Alternate terms often used are managed
learning environment, virtual learning environment, course
management system or learning support system. Today, most LMSes
make extensive use of the Web and include features such as discussion
forums, chats, journals, automated testing and grading tools and student
tracking. LMSes also are used to supplement regular face-to-face
courses. They are used in universities, schools and by businesses to
deliver corporate training.
</p><p>
Start up and maintenance costs for on-line education typically
have been high, with proprietary software solutions such as Blackboard and
WebCT being the dominant choice amongst academic institutions and
corporations.
But
cost is not the only or even the prime reason to look beyond available
proprietary LMS solutions. The ability to modify software is an
important consideration for many institutions that need to address
specific teaching and learning requirements. Others need to integrate
a new LMS with existing systems.
</p><p>
Several open-source projects have emerged to meet the growing interest
in open-source LMSes (see the on-line Resources). In this article, we
look at one popular open-source LMS, Moodle.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf44710"></a>
Introducing Moodle</h2></div></div><p>
In classic open-source fashion, Moodle was born out of a need to
scratch an itch. Frustrated by proprietary alternatives, Martin
Dougaimas, then a PhD candidate in Education with a background in
computer science, started Moodle in 1999. Version 1.0 was released in
August 2002. Since then, Moodle has continued to evolve at a rapid
rate, managed by Martin in Australia and propelled by an active
world-wide community of users and developers.
</p><p>
A single Moodle Web site can host a large number of courses. Each
course is managed by one or more teachers.
Courses can contain activities such as discussion
forums, student journals, quizzes, surveys, assignments, chats and
workshops. Moodle includes support for grading, file uploads, user
logging and tracking, multimedia, e-mail integration and many other
features,
all comparable to those
available in proprietary LMSes.
</p><p>
Moodle is developed on the popular LAMP platform&mdash;GNU/Linux, Apache,
MySQL and PHP. Part of Moodle's attraction is it can run
on almost any server that can run PHP. In addition, PostgreSQL can be used instead
of MySQL. The flexible technical requirements make it possible to install
and evaluate Moodle on almost any computer and even run it on shared Web
servers managed by Web hosting providers. Moodle is offered under the
GNU General Public License. The GPL, well-documented PHP code,
an active developer community and a modular design make it possible to
customize Moodle and integrate it with other open-source software. For
users, all Moodle requires is a Web browser and an Internet connection.
</p><p>
Most LMSes are instructor-oriented and largely concerned with how
course content is delivered. Moodle is based on a learner-oriented
philosophy called social constructionist pedagogy, in which students are
involved in constructing their own knowledge. The concepts behind this
philosophy of learning are that learners actively construct new
knowledge by tinkering, and they learn more by explaining what they have
learned to others and by adopting a more subjective stance to the
knowledge being created. These ideas run parallel to the way open-source
development works, in which the developers also often are users,
everyone is free to tinker with the software and code is constructed,
peer-reviewed and refined by the means of an open discussion. This
philosophy is the basis for the unusual name of this project. The
Moodle Web site explains the origin of the name:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The word Moodle was originally an acronym for Modular
Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment....It's also a
verb that describes the process of lazily meandering through
something, doing things as it occurs to you to do them, an
enjoyable tinkering that often leads to insight and creativity.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The social construction pedagogy is reflected in the design
and choice of Moodle features. For example, one of Moodle's features
is every course can have a glossary of terms. The glossary can be
set up to allow course participants to add their own terms and
definitions. Taking it a step further, Moodle allows comments to be
attached to each term, enabling participants to refine and clarify
these definitions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf44a28"></a>
Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
At the time of this writing, the latest stable release of Moodle is
version 1.3.1, which was released on June 5, 2004. If you are interested in
experimenting with the newest features, you also can download the
nightly development packages. Both the stable release and the
development versions are available from anonymous CVS. In our
experience, we have been able to upgrade Moodle installations by way of CVS
without problems. The stable CVS branch is new in v.1.3 and promises
a convenient way to maintain a Moodle installation.
</p><p>
Installing Moodle on a LAMP system is straightforward and
well-documented. After unpacking the downloaded package, place all
files and folders into your Web server's documents directory. Create a
MySQL database and account. Moodle needs a separate data directory to
store some files, such as user-uploaded images. This directory should
not be accessible directly over the Web. You can protect it
either by using an .htaccess file or by placing the directory outside the
Web server's documents directory.
</p><p>
The default Apache and PHP settings on most Web servers should be
adequate. PHP sessions support and file uploading need to be
enabled. Also, PHP safe mode needs to be disabled. Some Web
hosting providers do not allow disabling PHP safe mode while others
do, so check in advance.
</p><p>
A single file, config.php, stores the basic configuration settings, such as database information, Web site URL, directory paths and
permissions. Make a copy of the config-dist.php file provided by
Moodle, name it config.php and edit it using your favorite text
editor. This thoughtful arrangement is useful when you upgrade
Moodle. Moodle's config-dist.php is upgraded, but your config.php,
which contains settings specific to your installation, is left
untouched. The config.php contains detailed instructions and
examples.
</p><p>
Next, visit the main page of your Moodle Web site with a Web
browser. From this point on, Moodle handles its own installation over
the Web, setting up the database and creating tables. The defaults
should work to get you started, and you always can customize them
later. Finally, you are asked to create an administrator user
account. Successful creation of the user account completes the Moodle
installation, and you are returned to the home page of your new
Moodle site.
</p><p>
Once Moodle is installed, almost all regular administrative activities
can be carried out by using a Web browser. When logged in as the
administrator, a block containing administration links appears in
the left column of the main page after installation (Figure
1). The Configuration link in this block opens up a control panel
that allows the administrator to control all aspects of the Moodle
site using a Web browser. Again, every setting is meticulously
documented and examples are provided.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7478f1.large.jpg"><img src="7478f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Moodle Main Page after Installation
</p></div></div><p>
The Variables panel controls the basic operation of the Moodle site.
In most cases, the defaults should work fine. The Site Settings
panel is where you set the name of the Web site. This also is where you
can change the words used to refer to teachers and students&mdash;another
example of Moodle's flexibility. For example, you can specify that
teachers should be referred to as moderators or facilitators and
students should be referred to as participants.
At this point, the Moodle
site is ready. You can start creating courses and adding users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf44ef8"></a>
Administration</h2></div></div><p>
To add a new course, while logged in as the administrator, follow the
Courses link in the Administrator block on the main page of the
Moodle site and choose the button to add a new course. Courses are
classified into categories and each course has to belong to a
category. Miscellaneous is the default category. You can add,
delete or hide categories as needed.
</p><p>
Moodle provides three course formats: weekly, topics and social. The
weekly format is suitable for courses organized into weekly
activities. The topics format is suitable for courses organized into
topics instead of weeks. The social format is organized around a
single discussion forum. Choose a format and create the course (Figure 2). Once a course has been created, the assigned teacher for
that course can modify course settings at any time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7478f2.large.jpg"><img src="7478f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Creating a New Course
</p></div></div><p>
After you create the course, you are taken to the main page of the
newly created course. Choose the Turn editing on button at the top
right corner of the page. With the editing turned on, tiny icons
appear all over the page. These icons allow you to reposition
blocks of content on the page as well as add, edit or delete
resources and activities in the course (See Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7478f3.large.jpg"><img src="7478f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Adding Course Materials
</p></div></div><p>
The Users link in the administrator block allows the administrator
to add users to the Moodle site. Moodle has convenient user management
features. New users can create user accounts themselves by providing
an e-mail address. Moodle handles the signup process by confirming the
e-mail address, creating the account and generating a password. A user
that has forgotten the password can request to have it sent to his or
her e-mail address. The administrator also can import multiple users
from an external comma-delimited file. The administrator can assign
teachers for a course and enroll students to that course.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe4c580.0xf45478"></a>
Customization</h2></div></div><p>
Moodle comes with 15 themes that change the look of a Moodle
Web site, and you can switch themes directly from the Configuration
panel. It's easy to create new themes, too. Each theme is contained in
a subdirectory of the main theme directory. To create a custom
theme, copy one of the existing theme folders and give it a new
name. The folder for each theme contains certain standard files, such
as config.php and styles.php. The easiest way to change the look
of the theme is to tweak the file styles.php, which modifies the
Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) used for that theme. Want to add a logo at
the top of the page? Customize header.html. Any new subdirectory in
the main theme folder automatically appears in the Configuration
panel for themes. No special installation step is required.
</p><p>
Moodle's world-wide popularity&mdash;1,900
registered sites from 90
countries at last count&mdash;could be attributed to the fact that it is
available in 40 different languages, from Afrikaans to
Turkish. Similar to the plugin arrangement for themes, each
language pack is a subdirectory in the lang directory. Switching
languages is done easily through the Web control panel for
languages. But, Moodle takes flexibility a step further by making it
possible for an administrator to change all the phrases used in a
language pack. For example, if you want to change the word
&ldquo;courses&rdquo; to &ldquo;classes&rdquo; throughout the Moodle site, it can be changed once in the
language pack. The terms in the language pack can be edited directly
from the Web-based configuration panel.
</p><p>
The standard package of Moodle comes with over 15 modules for
various activities, such as discussion forums, chats, assignments,
journals, quizzes and surveys. Additional optional modules are
available on the Moodle Web site. Installing a module usually involves
copying the module's files into a subdirectory under the mod
directory. Some modules come with related language files that need to
be copied over to the appropriate subdirectory under the lang
directory, depending on which language pack you are using. Using the
configuration panel, it is possible to delete a module or change its
default settings.
</p><p>
The Web control panel also allows the administrator to set up automated
backups. Options control what is archived in the backup file and
when. For example, you can omit large log files from being included in
the backup. Teachers can make backups of courses, too. A backup without
user data can be used to set up a course for the next semester. The
backup file is in XML format, meaning your data is never
locked in a proprietary format and you maintain control over your own
data.

Why Moodle?</h2></div></div><p>
The Moodle Developers Manual lays out the development goals of the
project:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Moodle should run on the widest variety of platforms.
</p></li><li><p>
Moodle should be easy to install, learn and modify.
</p></li><li><p>
It should be easy to upgrade from one version to the next.
</p></li><li><p>
It should be modular to allow for growth.
</p></li><li><p>
It should be able to be used in conjunction with other systems.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In our experience, the Moodle project has managed to stay true to
these objectives even as it evolves rapidly. The quick pace of
development is apparent in the frequent releases. For example, Moodle
users had expressed interest in an integrated calendar, a feature
that Moodle lacked. In January 2004, Moodle users and developers
started discussing what calendaring features were needed and how they
should be implemented. A few months later, the May 2004 release
included an integrated calendar.
</p><p>
An often-repeated criticism of open-source software is it is
only for IT experts and is too difficult for basic users to install and
use. Yet, over 66% of Moodle users who responded to a Moodle survey
identified themselves as teachers, on-line learning researchers or
educational administrators.
</p><p>
Managing an LMS can be a complex task. What we like about Moodle is
it does not hide this complexity. Its
detailed on-line help, examples and sensible defaults assist the
user in installing, administering and using the LMS.
The greatest strength of Moodle is the community that has grown around
the project. Both developers and users participate in Moodle's active
discussion forums, sharing tips, posting code snippets, helping new
users, sharing resources and debating new ideas. Moodle's low cost,
flexibility and ease of use helps bring LMS technology within the reach
of those with limited technical and financial resources.
Moodle is a fine
example of how and why open source works.
