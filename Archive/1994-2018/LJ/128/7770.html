Throne Reading</h4><p>
This is in response to the &ldquo;Hey! You Kids! Get Out!&rdquo; letter
in the September 2004 issue.
Geeks have kids, and we are as proud of them as any
snippet of code. My kids <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> Linux from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span>
to GCompris to screensavers. They have their own
Linux box in the works and have never been exposed
to anything else. Heck&mdash;we even use Linux during
potty training!
Here is a pic to prove kids and Linux match up
quite nicely, and that <i  >LJ</i> is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>great</em></span> potty-training
tool.

More Ham Please</h4><p>
Just a quick note to congratulate you for your
<i  >LJ</i> September 2004 issue.
Yesterday, I went to my favorite newsstand and was
immediately drawn by the great article written about
PSK by Dr Volker Schroer. This article was the main
reason I decided to buy the magazine.
It is an excellent article and has inspired me to
go back and experiment with PSK under Linux. I'm an
amateur radio operator and was a former subscriber
to <i  >LJ</i>. I would love to see more Linux Ham radio
articles!

Tracking Down a Network Problem</h4><p>
I just purchased a Toshiba M30 laptop and installed
Debian on it. It took three days to get it all up and
running, but everything works perfectly, excluding
the Winmodem.
Shortly after everything was running smoothly, I ran
into problems. Right after I had upgraded my
Wi-Fi drivers, KDE applications started locking up
randomly. They never crashed, but they would freeze
for up to five minutes before performing a function. KDE
would take ten minutes to load, but for some reason,
this only would happen after the machine was running
for a while. Naturally, I rolled back the drivers to
no avail, then I assumed it was temperature, but the
rest of the system seemed very stable and the machine
wasn't that warm.
</p><p>
I really didn't know what to do but I recalled the
&ldquo;Ten Handy Commands Every Linux Developer Should Know&rdquo;
article from the September 2004 issue of <i  >LJ</i> and decided to
<tt  >apt-get install strace</tt> and try to figure out was
causing my problems. I couldn't figure out the
problem in KDE's startup sequence, but Konqueror
gave away the problem when I saw it hanging on an
attempt to connect to 127.0.0.1. I took a peek at my
/etc/network/interfaces file to discover that I,
or some script, inadvertently had removed the <tt  >iface
lo inet loopback</tt> entry that provides the network
loopback device. I added it back in and brought up
the interface. Everything is back to normal.
Thanks <i  >LJ</i>.

Support for Laptop Hardware</h4><p>
I just finished reading Lincoln Durey's article
&ldquo;Dear Laptop Vendor&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, October 2004], and I'm forced to ask &ldquo;How does
selling me (or Lincoln) a laptop without an OS on it
help Linux run on it better?&rdquo; Don't get me wrong,
I'm one frugal guy, so I'll gladly take the $100
discount, but how does that help (except my wallet)?
Wouldn't it be better to ask for Linux drivers
for their hardware or documented specs so that
open-source developers could write drivers for the
hardware? Perhaps I don't understand why Linux
can't do all those laptop things, but isn't that
how Apple's OS X can be UNIX and still be a fully
functional laptop? Apple owns the hardware specs,
and they write good drivers right? If not, how do
they do it? Their laptops suspend, hibernate, wakeup,
do back flips and make me breakfast.
</p><p>
My letter would be to the hardware vendor that's the
closest to going out of business (more desperate and
therefore hopefully more willing to take a chance),
and it would say, &ldquo;Want to boost sales? Write Linux drivers for your
laptop so that all the bells and whistles of your
platform will work. Oh, and if it's not too much
trouble, dump the pre-installed OS and reduce the
price accordingly!&rdquo;



<br><br>&mdash;<br>

Where drivers are concerned, the biggest thing a
laptop vendor can do is to require GPL drivers or
unrestricted documentation from the chipset suppliers.

issue.  &mdash;Ed.

Why DIY?</h4><p>
I've just read Phil Hollenback's article on building a Linux-based
WAN router. I was wondering if there was a reason why he didn't
use ImageStream's Rebel Router, which was reviewed by <i  >Linux Journal</i> several years ago [August 2002].
Keep up the good work.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
N. Huggins  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Phil's reply:</b></span> that's a good question, which I probably should have addressed more
directly in the article. We did examine the ImageStream routers.
However, we didn't go with them for a couple of reasons.
1) Most important, their drivers are proprietary and closed. Plus,
they make extensive modifications to the Linux kernel to make their
drivers work. We didn't want to use proprietary software.
2) I'm a little hazy on this because it has been a few months;
however, I believe the ImageStream hardware that will support a T3 plus
four T1s all in the same router gets to be quite expensive&mdash;their basic
Rebel Router can't handle that much bandwidth. You have to move up to
their carrier-grade solution.
</p><p>
The bottom line is we customize the heck out of our infrastructure, and
we wanted the software and hardware with the most flexibility. That's why
we built our own. However, if you are looking for a basic router and
don't have the admittedly esoteric requirements that we did, the
ImageStream Rebel seems like a good choice.
Thanks for reading the article!

Revealing Hidden Commands</h4><p>
Thanks for the article &ldquo;Ten Handy Commands Every
Linux Developer Should Know&rdquo; [<i  >LJ</i>, September
2004]. I'm not a developer,
but a now-retired longtime UNIX administrator.
I'm familiar with most of those commands but have been
missing my favorite ofiles, and now I see fuser
is a command with the same purpose. And, I was
unfamiliar with objdump.
Another program I used to use a lot&mdash;I've forgotten
the name at the moment&mdash;took a dump of a running
program without disturbing the program that was
running.
All of this points out that
Linux has a lot of neat stuff that people may be unaware of.
I know when I install a Linux distribution, I see
stuff getting installed that I don't know what it is,
and I have never used it.

Market Opportunity?</h4><p>
Let's face it, Linux is not a user-friendly,
ready-for-the-masses system.
I'm thoroughly convinced that Linux must get on the
desktop for the masses. The longer it isn't, the more
time Microsoft has to wheedle into the server market
and hijack the Internet.
Today, Linux hasn't made a strong enough push on the
desktop. Microsoft is so confident on the desktop that
their cheapest offering now retails for $200! A lot
of boats are being missed by Linux these days.
Much has been made of the network or appliance
computer, a cheap, minimalist home machine that
would do Web, e-mail, digital photography management
and word processing (all 90% of home users really
want/need from a computer). It's wide open for Linux,
but Linux seems to not care.

Laptops, Security and Thin Clients</h4><p>
Lincoln Durey's &ldquo;Dear Laptop Vendor&rdquo;
[<i  >LJ</i>, October 2004] was not very
useful. It would have been a far better use of space,
and his expertise, to explain how his staff sorts out
and solves the problems with getting Linux to work
properly on the laptops his company sells, and what
sorts of changes need to be made. Software is an
add-on option with ChemBook laptops. Durey already
has a solution to his problem if he wants it.
</p><p>
As a beginner/intermediate user I found Mick Bauer's
clear and complete explanations enjoyable to read
as well as helpful. I look forward to part two of
Linux Filesystem Security [page XX]. I appreciate very much
that Mick Bauer neither assumes I know something,
nor talks down to me, nor dumbs down his article.
</p><p>
Please do a thorough article on how to create thin
clients and serve them with a Linux server. Linux is
inherently a server OS. This huge advantage over the
popular proprietary OSes is not being exploited to its
full advantage for desktop use. There is no reason
for a home or small office to buy all new computers
every couple of years. All that is necessary is to
buy one good computer and use the old computers as
thin clients. I've seen it done, and now I want to
know how to do it.

Mention the US Army Connection</h4><p>
I'm really astonished by the little article by Gary
Glasscock on the game <span   class="emphasis"><em>America's Army for Linux</em></span>.
I'm a peace activist here in Italy. Just to be
clear, I've found no problem at all if Linux and
free software are used for military purposes, and
I've found <i  >LJ</i> very equal on these subjects, writing
about &ldquo;Tux at war&rdquo;, but also writing about
&ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
Hall on Brazil or the digital divide and Africa.
So, I'm astonished because a single thing is not stated
in this article: that the site <a href="http://www.americasarmy.com" target="_self">www.americasarmy.com</a>
is an initiative of the US Army, I think primarily
for recruiting troops.
I think this is a real mistake; please, preserve the
<i  >LJ</i> impartiality that I like so much.
Many thanks.
