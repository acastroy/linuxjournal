Today's inexpensive camcorders can shoot great video. All you need
to do a real video project is the right editing tools and, of
course, practice.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe935b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Every camcorder owner would like to turn raw video
into something real through editing. It does not matter
how much the camcorder box brags of special effects
and so forth, you still need proper editing tools.
Fortunately, with today's
powerful PCs, Linux and an application called Kino,
you can put together your own little Hollywood studio.
</p><p>
Kino is nonlinear editor software. It
can capture raw video, edit and re-organise it, and
export the final results. With additional free,
extra-cool plugins, Kino gives you all the necessary
tools to make good movies.
</p><p>
Producing a movie usually includes
making a recording with a camcorder. We don't cover this, but
start with
explaining how to copy a recorded raw video onto a PC with Kino. Modern
camcorders communicate with PCs through the IEEE1394 interface
that Apple calls FireWire; Sony prefers the name i.Link.
After capturing, you can edit
your raw video, adding titles and creating effects.
You also may want to improve your movie by
adding, mixing and replacing sounds. Kino supports all of these
functions. When your movie is finished, you may want to make
a DVD, so you can play it on a standalone DVD
player, or even make an MPEG4. The quality of compressed movies is
lower than the original raw files, so if you really want high quality and
to use
all the advantages of your digital camcorder,
you also
can copy the movie back to the DV tape with Kino and your camcorder.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe93768"></a>
Hardware Required</h2></div></div><p>
To send the video stream from a camcorder to a PC and
back, you need an IEEE1394 interface on both
sides, the PC and camcorder. Check your PC; many
modern computers, including laptops, have this interface
already built-in. If not, you can
buy an IEEE1394 card separately from many vendors. You
certainly need a digital video camcorder.
Your camcorder probably is either
Digital 8 (D8 for short) or MiniDV.
</p><p>
To connect the camcorder to the PC, you need a cable. Camcorders usually have
four-pin female connectors, and PCs have six-pin connectors. Take a look at
your computer (or IEEE1394 card) and buy a 4-4 or 4-6 cable if you
do not have the correct cable.
</p><p>
Obviously, you need a PC equipped with a large
capacity hard disk. You must have a
lot of free space. For instance, to copy a 60-minute
MiniDV tape to your computer, about 12Gb is necessary.
Further work might need about 15Gb for edited frames
and sounds, so 27Gb of free space is the absolute
minimum for making a movie from one hour of
raw video. Depending on what you want to do, you may need an
extra 14Gb to export your results to a new .dv file. While
capturing, the computer has to record about 3.5MB per second, so the hard
disk should work as quickly as possible. Any modern
Ultra-DMA drive works if configured properly.
</p><p>
A 1GHz
processor and 128MB of memory is the absolute minimum
suitable configuration for working with video. To work
comfortably, you could use more memory
and possibly a more powerful CPU.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe93978"></a>
Software Required</h2></div></div><p>
As far as software, you need Kino and the libraries it uses, but this is
not everything. Kino provides only basic tools for
editing and has few effects. Tim Shead and Dan Dennedy have been
developing timfx, a set of Kino plugins that adds extra effects.
Another plugin, called dvtitle, by Alejandro Sierra is needed for adding
titles.
</p><p>
Because Kino requires additional programs and libraries, installing from
source is not a simple task (see the on-line Resources section for Kino's
home page).
Kino is available as a package for several
distributions, including Debian, SuSE and Fedora.
Installing a package is much easier than building from source.
</p><p>
Kino development is progressing quickly. While writing
this article, the latest version was 0.7.3. In Debian
3.0 (stable), the Kino version is 0.5.0, and Debian 3.1
(the developing branch) suggests the latest version is 0.7.3. SuSE
9.1 suggests using Kino 0.7.0.
To help you keep the programs up to date we created all
necessary packages. See Resources for links.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe93b30"></a>
Moving Raw Video to a PC</h2></div></div><p>
Once the software is installed, connect your
camcorder to the PC by IEEE1394, and run the command
<tt  >kino</tt> from any X terminal or,
under KDE or GNOME, from the Alt-F2 dialog. The Kino
opening window is similar to the one shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7779f1.large.jpg"><img src="7779f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Kino's main window as seen when starting a new session.
</p></div></div><p>
The GUI is easy to understand. To capture video,
choose the Capture tab on the right. Before
starting to capture, however, it is best to check
your preferences. Click on Edit&rarr;Preferences to
see the default settings. Set Normalisation, Audio
and Aspect Ratio according to your camcorder.
Parameters depend on the camcorder you are
using and the country where you bought it. The NTSC
standard is used in the USA, Canada and Japan, and
the PAL standard is used everywhere else.
Camcorders usually have two audio modes, 16 bits and
14 bits, and the latter often is set by default. Change this to
16 bits before recording for better quality.
</p><p>
Captured frames can be stored in three formats, .dv and two kinds of .avi
files. Generally, it does not matter which kind of
format you use; we prefer to use raw DV.
</p><p>
After setting your preferences, press Capture, and enter
a filename for the captured video
without using an extension. You also can choose the Auto Split
Files option so Kino saves each automatically
recognised change of scene in a separate file, adding
a number to the core filename. You can accept
the default settings for all the rest.
</p><p>
Now, set your camcorder so it understands control signals. Usually this is
in the Play mode, but check the manual if you are uncertain.
Try controlling the camcorder with Kino by
moving the tape back and forward. Try pressing the Play button in Kino.
The video should start playing, and its output should be displayed in the
main Kino window as well as on the camcorder screen. Notice
the dropped frames field. Theoretically, this should be zero, but
in practice, it's not bad if the first one or two frames are
lost. If, however, the number of dropped frames keeps increasing,
your hardware is too slow or misconfigured.
If you cannot control the camcorder with Kino, try
loading the raw1394 driver manually. As root, type
<tt  >modprobe raw1394</tt>.
</p><p>
If you have slow hardware, you also can try using dvgrab,
a command-line tool for grabbing DV. This
program is available from the Kino home page
(see Resources). Before using it, exit your X
session. Follow the directions from its man page. After
grabbing the raw video, you can start Kino and load
the captured files for editing as described
below.
</p><p>
If the Play option operates correctly, you can start capturing. Go to
1&ndash;2 seconds before the position where you want to start, and click
Capture. Kino starts the camcorder and captures. Pressing Stop at any time
stops the capturing. Video transferred in this way appears in the
scene list on the left part of the Kino screen. AutoSplit sometimes
works incorrectly, but you can correct
that later.
Kino's window right after capture is shown in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7779f2.large.jpg"><img src="7779f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Kino's Window after Capturing
</p></div></div><p>
As soon as you finish capturing, select Save from the File menu, and
save the project as a
Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL)
file.
An SMIL example is shown in
Listing 1. Between the &lt;seq&gt; and
&lt;/seq&gt; tags, clip descriptions appear. Each one defines a simple or a
complex scene. A simple scene is described by a &lt;video...&gt; command
that points to the first and the last frames of the clip file that will be
used in the movie; a complex scene is a set of simple scenes.
The first frame of each scene is shown in the left panel of the Kino
Storyboard.

    &lt;video src="/mnt/RAW FILES/Paris004.dv" clipBegin="26" clipEnd="234"/&gt;
  &lt;/seq&gt;
&lt;/smil&gt;

</pre></div><p>
If your movie is assembled from many different tapes,
put a new one in the camcorder and repeat the above steps.
</p><p>
In the storyboard near the first frame of a scene, you can find useful
information, such as
the name of the file where the scene is located,
the time mark from which the scene starts and
the duration of the scene.
</p><p>
While capturing, Kino displays the time according to the original source.
In edit mode, timecode displays the running movie time.
Time can be displayed in many formats. The simplest is
the frame format. This is a frame counter that starts from
zero. Other formats are much more usable by humans like seconds; minutes
also are available. We like to use the industry-standard, Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) timecode
format, which shows both
the time and a frame counter, separated by
semicolon. For instance, if you see the time noted as 00:07:40;15, it
means 7 minutes, 40 seconds and 15 frames. You can select the time format
you prefer from the Time pull-down menu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe94630"></a>
Editing Video</h2></div></div><p>
Mozart is said not to have written drafts, but not everyone
can be like Mozart. If you start recording
too early or finish too late, a scene may need to be
cut, or you may end up with bad frames, unnecessary frames or frames of the
wrong duration.
The duration of a scene usually is determined by
the action. If there is no action, the scene duration should
be no longer than 4&ndash;6 seconds. Shorter scenes
look like flashes, and longer ones are boring.
</p><p>
To begin editing, look through the scenes. If you find only one or two
problem frames in a scene, you either can remove them or split them with
the next frame
in the case of incorrect AutoSplit.
To remove a scene, press the Edit tab on the right, point at
the scene you want to delete in the storyboard and click on it. The main
window shows the first frame of the scene. Click the
scissor icon in the toolbar. The scene
disappears from the storyboard, and the next scene's first frame is
displayed in the main window.
</p><p>
Often you want to see an overview of the individual frames in a scene.
With Kino, you can do this by clicking on Timeline.
Figure 3 shows an example of the Kino Timeline.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7779f3.large.jpg"><img src="7779f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. An Overview of the Scene with Timeline
</p></div></div><p>
If only a part needs to be cut from a scene, it should be split
into bad and good parts. Use the transport control line to review and
locate them. If you click on the split icon in the toolbar, the
current frame starts a newly created scene. Be sure the current frame is in
the scene you want to delete by clicking Cut. This method works
well if you need to delete a central part of a scene. If you want
to set the beginning or the end point of a scene accurately, it's better
to use Trim.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe949f8"></a>
Trim</h2></div></div><p>
Trim is a powerful tool for editing. The most basic use is to
remedy problems with the first or last frames in a
scene.
To use Trim, select the scene in the Storyboard and click
Trim. You should see a scrub bar and two text boxes; the one on the left
is labeled In and the right one is labeled Out, as shown in Figure 4.
These boxes
show frame numbers for the starting and ending points for the
current scene in the clip file. Use the control buttons or the triangle above
the bar line to navigate to your new starting position. Use the
single frame features for higher accuracy. Having specified the new
starting position, click the left triangle below the line to change
position. The In text box changes to reflect this selection. To trim the
end of the scene, do the same thing with the ending point, and set it by
clicking on the right triangle. If you are satisfied,
click the red Apply button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7779f4.large.jpg"><img src="7779f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Editing with Trim
</p></div></div><p>
Exiting the Trim mode or choosing a new scene in the Storyboard to edit also
applies any changes you made, so be
careful while editing.
</p><p>
Under the In pointer is a text field indicating the
current mode for trimming. Insert and
Overwrite are the two trim modes and are similar to using a text editor.
With Overwrite,
the currently selected scene in the Storyboard is replaced by
the newest one; Insert adds a new scene before or after the
currently selected scene. The Insert
mode has no Apply button, only Before and After icons. This means you must make your
selection to apply the changes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe8b650"></a>
Put Scenes in Line</h2></div></div><p>
When all of your scenes or episodes are free of unwanted frames,
put them in the right order. An easy way to
reorder them is by using Storyboard. Click Edit
first, then click a scene in the Storyboard you want to move and click
Cut. Then, select the scene you want to follow it,
and click Paste. The cut scene appears
before the selected scene.
</p><p>
An even easier way to re-order scenes is by using
drag and drop. In the Edit mode, click on the scene you want to move,
hold down the mouse button and drag it to the required place in the
Storyboard list. The scene appears at this position after you release
the mouse button. While dragging and dropping, pay attention to the
thin line that indicates the current target position. Drop does not work
if the target shows a dotted rectangle.
You also can insert previously captured video clips into your current
movie project.
The Commands/Insert Movie button puts the selected file at the
current position, and Commands/Append Movie follows it.
Inserted files are split
into scenes automatically if required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe8b7b0"></a>
Joining Scenes with Effects</h2></div></div><p>
After your scenes are assembled, the video part of your movie is
almost done, but you still can add some of the effects that Kino and
timfx provide. Be careful with effects, though&mdash;too many effects
can distract viewers. You don't have to
put an effect on every scene change, just like you don't have to use
a new font in every section of a document.
The simplest Kino effect is the Barn Door. Let's join two
scenes with it.
</p><p>
Click FX&rarr;Video Transition. Select
Barn Door Wipe from the pull-down menu. In the other field, choose
what kind of door you want. Figure 5 shows a
vertical one. The storyboard shows the first frame of the current
scene that we want to join with the next one. So we select Frames
following and Forward. To see the result before rendering,
click Preview. Play with other options of this effect
and preview them. When you are satisfied with a result, press
Render.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7779f5.large.jpg"><img src="7779f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Making the Kino Barn Door Wipe effect&mdash;a preview of the effect is
shown in the special window.
</p></div></div><p>
The render button has a red spot on it to show its importance. While rendering,
Kino creates a new file. All previous editing keeps the original raw
files untouched&mdash;only the SMIL has been
changed. Now you can create a new file that is included into the project
automatically.
</p><p>
Kino provides the Barn Door effect itself. Additional effects
are available through timfx. Figure 6
shows the complete list. Many effects are well known, such as
what
we illustrate here with creating titles.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7779f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7779f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Video Transition Menu
</p></div></div><p>
Kino also can change the speed of your video. This function is used
to add comic effects or make moments seem longer. To change the speed,
use the scale bar under Advanced Options and push the
Speed button. You also can activate Reverse to play your clip
from the end back to the starting point. Changing the speed and
reversing can be combined with the Transition or Filter effects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe8bf40"></a>
Making Titles</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to add text comments to an episode,
dvtitler can help. As an example, let's create
a simple album that represents the
characters acting in our movie. You even can create it using photos
with an image editor such as
The GIMP.
</p><p>
First, take a picture of the person and resize it for inserting into
the movie. For PAL, the size should be 720&times;576, for NTSC 720&times;480.
</p><p>
Let's assume the following for this example. The first person
will be shown for five seconds, then there will be four seconds for
changing, and then five
seconds again for the next actor.
</p><p>
From the FX menu, select Create (5+4)sec*25=225 frames. To
keep the number of frames even, we choose Create From File&rarr;226 frames, as
shown in Figure 8. At the same time, we
add the title &ldquo;Denys Tonkonog&rdquo;. It consists of two centered lines and
initially is located on the top right of the frame. As the final
position is the same, the title does not move in the frames. The X
offset and Y offset are used to keep the complete title in the
frames, even if the movie is shown on TV, due to the possibly limited
size of TV screens. The screenshot of the title preview is shown
in Figure 9.

Figure 10. A Preview of Joining Titles with Image Luna
</p></div></div><p>
We create another title, &ldquo;Olexiy Tykhomyrov&rdquo;, in the same
manner. Then, we
go back to Edit mode and use Split to separate the parts for
applying the effect. Instead of creating two title scenes, we create
four. They are five seconds in duration, then four seconds, four seconds again
and then five seconds. The two central scenes (both four seconds)
are joined into one with Image Luma.
</p><p>
In FX mode, click on the second scene under the
Storyboard. Under Video Transition, select Image
Luma. Next, specify the file with luma image. In the example
(Figure 10), we used a standard gradient file
left_to_right.png. Do not forget to change the mode from Insert to
Overwrite. Once rendered, you have three scenes instead of four.
The Timeline of the scene with changing titles is shown in
Figure 3.
Using Image Luma with different files can help you create
many interesting effects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe8c830"></a>
Sound</h2></div></div><p>
With Kino, you can change the sound
in your scenes completely, add sound to a scene, mix music or leave
the soundtracks untouched. Finding suitable music for mixing or replacing
might be the most difficult part of the work. For noncommercial projects, check
Creative Commons.
</p><p>
Kino works with sounds in WAV format, not MP3.
If you have an MP3 file and want to use it in your film, you have
to convert it to WAV. We prefer to use mpg123:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mpg123 --wav foo.wav foo.mp3.
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are using live sound, it's better to export soundtracks
from a .dv source because sound is lost with cut video scenes. To edit
sound, we use snd. Find the starting and ending points of the scene to use
the sounds, then go to Audio. Select the parameters as needed, including From
and To (Figure 11).
Do not forget
to specify the output file without an extension.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7779f11.large.jpg"><img src="7779f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 12. Audio Transition Menu
</p></div></div><p>
You can use Split to join
several scenes into one in order to apply sounds. Be sure the scene for
applying sounds is selected in the Storyboard.
Next, click on FX and select Audio Transition.
Choose Dub for applying sounds from the file
or Mix for mixing the file with what already is in the
scene. Add your audio file and preview the scene. Play
with the parameters, and when you're satisfied, press Render.
Rendering may take some time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9b580.0xe8ce08"></a>
Exporting the Movie</h2></div></div><p>
After putting everything together, output the results. Although it is
possible to create many output formats, to keep the original quality, we
recommend that you output your film back to the tape to save hard disk
space. Do this by selecting the Export tab and then
IEEE1394 from the menu.
Before exporting through this interface, set up
the dv1394 device and driver. First, issue one of the two following
commands, depending on your camcorder. The command creates the dv1394
device.
</p><p>
For PAL systems the command is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mknod -m 666 /dev/dv1394 c 171 34
</pre>
</p><p>
For NTSC systems the command is different:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mknod -m 666 /dev/dv1394 c 171 32
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, still as root, load the driver with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe dv1394
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, as an ordinary user from Kino, select Preferences&rarr;IEEE1394. A window
similar to
Figure 13 appears in
the screen. If you captured with Kino, the part titled DV
Capture is filled in correctly; your camcorder is recognised as
a VCR (AV/C) Control device.
The camcorder should be turned
on so it understands control signals
(usually Play mode).

Figure 13. Setting Kino for Exporting Film with IEEE1394 to the
Camcorder
</p></div></div><p>
To output through the IEEE1394 interface, change the
clue line dv1394 device to
/dev/dv1394. Then click OK to close the
setup menu.
Next, click Export and select IEEE1394. You should see something like
Figure 14.

Figure 14. Exporting the Movie Back to the Camcorder
</p></div></div><p>
Notice the information line on the bottom of Figure 14. Here, Kino informs you
about dv1394 device availability. If it complains, wait about
20&ndash;40
seconds. If the error repeats after this interval, read more
information about the device on the Linux1394 home page.
</p><p>
Next, select Preview. The movie should start playing on the
camcorder
screen. Now, put the
tape in the camcorder to the position where you
want to write, and select
the Export button to
start writing the movie to the tape. Check what your camcorder indicates
according to its User's Manual. Usually it shows a line like DV Input and
possibly provides additional DV export information.
</p><p>
If everything is okay, you can stop the camcorder, put the tape
exactly at the position from where you want to write the movie
and start exporting. The time needed for writing is equal to the movie
duration. While exporting, Kino indicates the elapsed and remaining time in
the bottom of the export window.
</p><p>
You also can export the movie as a file or a set of files. Kino, with
additional programs, provides the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A DV file that stores the movie in a new file format, which can be
used further for compression and exporting without the Kino
interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Stills save the movie as a sequence of images in
JPEG format.
</p></li><li><p>
MPEG codes the movie to MPEG or DivX.
</p></li><li><p>
Audio lets you save only the audio tracks.
</p></li><li><p>
DV pipe gives you a nice tool to create your own method of
saving movies. It also includes standard features, such as exporting
to MPEG1 for Video CD or to MPEG2.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Remember that all export features might not work on the box you
are currently using; installing extra programs might be
necessary. Exporting to a DV file should work and reflect the
general rules similar to saving a movie on the tape with the camcorder
and IEEE1394 interface.
</p><p>
To export the movie into a single .dv file, select Export/DV
File. Disable the option Auto Spilt Files, and specify All as
Export Range to export the whole movie from the scene list. Select
Type File&mdash;we prefer Raw DV. Put zero values into the fields
Frame per File and Max File name, as shown in Figure 15. Click Export.
Kino starts exporting, indicating the estimated
time necessary to finish the process.

Some Final Remarks</h2></div></div><p>
Kino still is under development and
may crash sporadically when you are using
Edit or Trim, so make sure you save your
movie project regularly. Although Kino watches the files it creates,
it may lose control of them in the case of a crash. In order to keep your
hard disk clean, do not forget remove unused .dv files.
