Thanks to an operating system that empowers students
to develop skills, and an ambitious public access
plan, the Internet isn't leaving the poorest region
in Spain behind.

People who visit Extremadura are nicely surprised
at the rich history of the place, the kindness of
the people and the good cuisine. Now
we can add a new characteristic to the qualities
of the region: it has the largest Free Software
implementation in the world.
</p><p>
Extremadura is one of 17 autonomous communities in
Spain. Each one of these communities is made of one or
more provinces and has considerable independence. They
are entitled to rule and decide independently from
the central government on several home affairs,
including their educational systems.
</p><p>
Extremadura also is the poorest region in Spain and
the fifth poorest region in the European Union. In its
recent history, we have seen how diverse factors have
increased the economic and social breach between the
region and the rest of Europe. In 1998 an alert arose&mdash;the Internet was going to increase the gap.
</p><p>
For that reason, a unique project was started. A regional network called
Intranet Extremadura was created, and it currently connects more than
1,400 dispersed points including regional administrative centers, schools,
hospitals and centers for public access.
</p><p>
But that is not everything. Since 2002, Extremadura
has the largest number of computers per student in
Europe, with an average of one computer for every two
students. The number goes up to 68,000 computers
serving more than 120,000 students in high
schools.
</p><p>
All these computers make up a network running the
favorite operating system of the readers of this
magazine, GNU/Linux. The localized version is called
gnuLinEx, formerly LinEx.
</p><p>
From its beginning, the distribution has been based
on Debian GNU/Linux, with the effort focused on the
adaptation of the operating system, translation of
educational applications and the simplification of
the installation process.
</p><p>
Last August, the 2004 version of LinEx appeared.
The Debian port of Anaconda
made by Progeny is used for the installation. Any GNU/Linux user that
previously had installed Red Hat or Fedora before already should
be used to it.
</p><p>
We offer either a Gnome 2.6 desktop or XFCE4 for
low-end computers. The kernel version is 2.6.7 with
support for diverse devices found in Spain and patched
with supermount to allow easy access to removable
devices from the desktop.
</p><p>
From the educational applications available in
gnuLinEx, the most impressive one is Squeak. Squeak
is a powerful multimedia and educational environment&mdash;an implementation of Smalltalk-80, whose image for
the Spanish-speaking world is contributed to actively
by the government of Extremadura itself.
</p><p>
The new features of gnuLinEx are not only for
the end user. This distribution is one of the first
to use component technology for the building
of the distribution. This technology, part of the
Componentized Linux (CL) Project, allows us to think of a
GNU/Linux distribution as a set of interchangeable
parts or, in terms of CL, components.
</p><p>
This way, a distro builders can add support for
MySQL simply by adding the respective component, or change the
GNOME 2.6 component with a KDE 3.2 component if they
prefer.
</p><p>
The base component of CL, also included in gnuLinEx,
is called LSB 2.0. It contains all the necessary
software to comply with specification 2.0 of
the Linux Standard Base (LSB).
</p><p>
But the component model did not only help in the
building of gnuLinEx; it keeps helping in the
building of derived works as well, such as LinEx Company
and LinEx Gamer. The first one is oriented to the
business world, and the second one is for all of
us who enjoy using the computer for more than work.
</p><p>
Guadalinex is the localized version of Debian
GNU/Linux used by the autonomous community of
Andalusia, Spain. The people of Andalusia and
Extremadura reached an agreement to unite their
efforts in the creation of their respective operating
systems for the 2005 version, with a considerable
common base. Dividing efforts in the maintenance of
their own components, both teams will be able to concentrate
on other subjects such as accessibility, usability
and hardware support.
</p><p>
If you are a Spanish-speaking GNU/Linux
enthusiast and want a complete Debian system with
graphical installation, or if you are interested in
the use of computers in education, you should take
a look at gnuLinEx 2004.
</p><p>
M&eacute;rida is the capital of Extremadura. Two thousand years ago, it was
the capital of the Roman province of Lusitania and one of the most
important cities in the Roman empire in Emperor Augustus' time.
Currently, it
 is
starting to be considered the capital of the Free Software empire, with the
largest implementation worldwide. You are invited to join.
