Think you can't afford best-of-breed spam and virus protection for your
business? Here are two good reasons to think again.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With spam and e-mail worms on the rise, it's boom-time for the
makers of antispam and antivirus solutions. New anti-spam laws in Europe
and the US have done little to solve the problem, and this situation has sent many
people shopping for technological solutions: spam and virus filters.
</p><p>
Scanning and filtering content at every desktop is expensive and
impractical, however. Ideally, the spam and virus problem should be tackled
as close to the source as possible, to shield everyone downstream. This
strategy lets an organization focus its resources on one place, typically
the mail gateway.
</p><p>
Server-based solutions rarely come cheap, however. Most of these products
are licensed on a per-mailbox basis, whether as add-on software for mail
servers or as standalone content-filtering appliances. These solutions can
cost thousands of dollars and often require annual subscription fees for
access to updated virus signatures and spam patterns.
</p><p>
In this article, we take a look at an open-source content-filtering
solution, amavisd-new, and a powerful extension of this project called Maia
Mailguard.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184b500"></a>
amavisd-new</h2></div></div><p>
Conceptually, amavisd-new is a mail filter&mdash;it receives mail from your mail
gateway, scans the mail for viruses and spam, quarantines, rejects or
discards offending items, and relays the rest to another mail server
downstream for delivery. In practice, amavisd-new often is sandwiched
between two mail servers running on the same host, particularly at smaller
sites where hosting the mail server and content filters on a single machine
is practical. Larger sites may choose to install amavisd-new, SpamAssassin
and virus scanners together on a separate content-filtering machine.
Massive sites may want a load-balanced array of such machines.
</p><p>
amavisd-new was written in Perl, with security and reliability in mind, and
works well on virtually all UNIX platforms. It is an RFC-compliant mail
handler, designed never to lose any mail. To that end, amavisd-new does not
accept responsibility for a mail item until the downstream mail server has
done so. This means any errors that occur while filtering the mail
do not cause the mail to be lost; it remains in the upstream mail
server's queue.
amavisd-new offers four types of filtering:
virus/malware scanning, spam filtering, banning dangerous attachment
types and invalid mail headers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184b660"></a>
Virus Scanning</h2></div></div><p>
amavisd-new is not a virus scanner; rather it's a framework that calls one
or more virus scanners. More than 30 popular virus scanners currently
are supported, including proprietary products from such vendors as Sophos,
Symantec and Network Associates, as well as the open-source Clam Antivirus.
</p><p>
Both command-line and d&aelig;monized virus scanners are supported, though
d&aelig;monized scanners are much more efficient than their command-line
cousins. If your mail server processes a lot of mail, you don't want to
have to load a command-line scanner into memory for each mail item and
unload it afterward. A virus scanner that runs as a d&aelig;mon gets loaded once
and then stays in memory, making the process much faster.
</p><p>
If you have multiple virus scanners installed, you can arrange them in
primary and secondary groups. The secondary group is consulted if
none of the primary scanners is operational.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184b818"></a>
Spam Filtering</h2></div></div><p>
Spam filtering is handled by amavisd-new by integrating it with
SpamAssassin. amavisd-new calls SpamAssassin once per mail item, no matter
how many recipients there are, so mailing-list postings don't consume any
more resources than does mail addressed to a single recipient.
</p><p>
SpamAssassin provides a broad-spectrum approach to spam filtering,
including feature recognition, DNSBL and SPF lookups, collaborative
reporting networks and Bayesian learning mechanisms. All of these tests
contribute a numeric score to a total for each mail item, and each user can
specify a threshold score for deciding whether an item is spam or ham.
This is an effective combination, as the strengths of one method make
up for the weaknesses of another.
</p><p>
Feature recognizers check the headers or the body of the e-mail
looking for patterns that human beings have identified as
markers of spam or ham (non-spam mail). The fact that the
Date: header contains a time 12 hours in the future or that
the mail contains an image but no text might qualify as spam
symptoms, whereas a message containing more than a thousand
words is more likely to be ham.
</p><p>
SpamAssassin also can check the IP address of the connecting mail server or
client against a number of DNS-based block lists (DNSBLs) to determine
whether that address is a known spam source. Unlike the traditional use of
DNSBLs, however, SpamAssassin does not consider a listing to be damning by
itself; it simply adds a value to the mail's total score. This is a much
more flexible approach, one that lets you adjust the scores assigned to each
DNSBL according to how much you trust that list and the policies of its
maintainers. The upcoming SpamAssassin 3.0 also adds support for Sender
Policy Framework (SPF) lookups, which try to verify that the connecting
host has the authority to send mail for its domain.
</p><p>
Collaborative reporting networks, such as Vipul's Razor, Pyzor and the
Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (DCC) offer another kind of resource for
SpamAssassin to consult. The idea is that because spam is broadcast to
millions of recipients, by the time you receive your copy, a lot of other
people
have received more or less identical copies. If a lot of those people
already have reported that particular mail as spam, your own spam filter
should be able to use that fact in its own decision-making process.
</p><p>
Last, but certainly not least, SpamAssassin offers a Bayesian learning
mechanism, which essentially is an automated feature recognizer. Although the
manually designed feature recognizers listed above rely on human beings to point
out features that indicate spam or ham, the Bayesian approach tries to
pick out
these features automatically, based on an analysis of the spam and ham
you've received already.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184bad8"></a>
Banning Dangerous Attachment Types</h2></div></div><p>
As a fail-safe measure, it often is a good idea to block mail containing
executable attachments, even though your virus scanners may claim
they're clean. Virus scanners aren't perfect, after all, and brand-new
malware might reach your network before your antivirus vendor makes a new
signature available to detect it. amavisd-new lets you define a list of
file extensions, content classes and MIME-types that should be quarantined,
rejected or discarded.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184bbe0"></a>
Dealing with Invalid Mail Headers</h2></div></div><p>
According to RFC 2822, mail headers are not supposed to contain any
characters above 127 nor any NUL or bare carriage-return characters.
Characters outside this range are supposed to be specially encoded, so that
mail software around the world can parse them without confusion. When mail
with invalid headers arrives, it could be the product of a poorly written
mail client, but often this is a symptom of a specially designed program
used by spammers to do their mass mailings. The authors of this so-called
ratware often are English speakers, and they don't typically think about
the fact that their software might be used by spammers who speak other
languages. When those spammers try to use these tools to send their mail,
the ratware does not encode the special characters, producing invalid mail
headers. With amavisd-new, you can decide how to handle mail with invalid
headers: quarantine it, reject it, discard it or let it through.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184bce8"></a>
Setting Content-Filtering Policies</h2></div></div><p>
amavisd-new lets administrators define system-wide content-filtering
policies, but these settings can be overridden at the domain and user
levels. Some users may want to have their mail scanned for all four
suspicious content types&mdash;viruses, spam, banned files and bad
headers&mdash;while others might prefer to disable one or more of those checks.
One user might want mail arriving with a spam score of 5.0 or higher to be
quarantined, while another user might prefer to have the Subject: header
prefixed with a special tag, such as ***SPAM***, if the score is 4.0 or
higher but have it blocked only if the score is at least 8.0. This
fine-grained control over the filtering process lets administrators
accommodate a wide range of users with different needs.
</p><p>
Similarly, amavisd-new provides whitelists and blacklists at all three of
these levels. This allows administrators to define system-wide lists; at
the other end, users can maintain their own individual lists.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184be48"></a>
Quarantining and Notification Options</h2></div></div><p>
When amavisd-new blocks an e-mail, it can be configured to do a number of
things to that mail. The mail can be stored in a quarantine directory or
mailbox, including special per-user mailboxes, such as joe+spam. You
also can configure amavisd-new to reject the mail, refusing to accept it from
the upstream mail server or discard it quietly.
</p><p>
If your organization's policies require that you notify the senders of
blocked mail, amavisd-new can be configured to do so. This is a
controversial subject, however. A lot of people find virus alerts
and spam complaint e-mails to be more of a nuisance than a help nowadays,
particularly because the sender addresses of these items often are forged. If
you must send virus notifications, amavisd-new provides a mechanism for
listing the viruses known to fake the sender's address, so
notices are not sent out when those viruses are detected. This list
must be maintained by hand and must be matched to the names your
particular virus scanners generate. If you find it easier to list the
viruses that don't fake sender addresses, you can use an inverse list instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184bfa8"></a>
Maia Mailguard</h2></div></div><p>
The Maia Mailguard Project began its life as a simple Web front end for
amavisd-new, designed to let users adjust their content-filter settings and
manage their quarantines from a convenient interface. The project proved
quite popular with ISPs, Web-mail providers and companies offering off-site
content filtering, however, and the needs of these larger-scale clients
soon developed Maia Mailguard into something much more sophisticated.
</p><p>
Maia Mailguard is a complete spam and virus management system, consisting
of PHP, SQL and Perl scripts, a MySQL or PostgreSQL database and, of
course, amavisd-new, SpamAssassin and supported virus scanners. Arrays of
content filters can be managed from a single Maia interface, all sharing
the same SQL database. Designed to make content filtering, quarantine
management and spam reporting easier, Maia Mailguard is in many ways a new
kind of tool for mail users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184c108"></a>
Web Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Maia's Web-based interface lets users authenticate against a variety of
sources, including a POP3 or IMAP server, an LDAP server, an external SQL
database or Maia's own internal database. Users can be added manually by
an administrator or automatically when mail arrives for a local address
that Maia hasn't seen before.
</p><p>
Users can have multiple e-mail addresses linked to their accounts, but each
e-mail address has its own content-filtering settings (Figure 1). Users can add and remove addresses from their whitelists and
blacklists with the Web interface (Figure 2), while
administrators manage domain-level and system-wide settings from
another set of Web pages (Figure 3). Statistics are
maintained for all four of amavisd-new's mail types, as well as blacklisted
and whitelisted items, oversized items, false positives and false
negatives (Figure 4). Other tables keep track of viruses by
type and by how often specific SpamAssassin rules are triggered. Graphical
charts can be generated on the fly from this data or generated as static
pages at scheduled intervals.

</p></div></div><p>
Thanks to the fact that Maia puts quarantine management and content-filtering controls in the hands of users themselves, there isn't a lot of
work
left for administrators to do on a day-to-day basis. With Maia's Perl
scripts running at scheduled intervals to report user-confirmed spam and
to expire old quarantine items, the system all but manages itself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x184c9a0"></a>
Quarantine Management</h2></div></div><p>
When mail gets quarantined on behalf of a user, it's important that the
user has a convenient way to access that mail. Maia provides a list of the
items in a user's quarantine, sorted by spam score so that the items most
likely to be there by mistake&mdash;the false positives&mdash;are kept closer to the
top of the list and are easier to spot (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7427f5.large.jpg"><img src="7427f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The user's quarantine is sorted by spam score.
</p></div></div><p>
If you're not sure from the subject line whether the mail is legitimate,
you can click on the subject to open the e-mail in Maia's mail viewer
(Figure 6). The mail viewer is safe to use on all types
of mail, as it doesn't decode most attachments but does block remote images and
strip away HTML tags that could redirect you to another site. You can view
the mail in its decoded form or in its raw form, complete with all of the
original mail headers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7427f6.large.jpg"><img src="7427f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The mail viewer provides a safe way to inspect suspicious mail.
</p></div></div><p>
If you decide that the mail is legitimate after all, you can click a button
to rescue the item from your quarantine and have it delivered to you. At
the same time, Maia tells SpamAssassin about the mistake; the
Bayesian learning system is less likely to make the same mistake in the
future. You also can configure Maia to add the sender's address to your
whitelist automatically when you rescue an item in this manner.
</p><p>
In addition to the quarantine, Maia offers a ham cache, which
essentially is a list of the legitimate mail that you've received recently
(Figure 7). The purpose of the ham cache is to let you
report spam that somehow got past the filters&mdash;the false negatives. By
marking these items properly as spam, you help to train SpamAssassin's
Bayesian learning system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7427f7.large.jpg"><img src="7427f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The ham cache allows a user to report false negatives.
</p></div></div><p>
The quarantine and ham cache also provide a means for you to confirm the
status of the mail you've received. This not only helps train the Bayesian
learning system, it also makes it possible to report spam properly,
because
it's been confirmed by a human being.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x18439c0"></a>
Spam Reporting</h2></div></div><p>
Most spam filters are concerned only with defending against the onslaught
of spam and do little or nothing to prevent it in the first
place. Because Maia allows users to confirm the status of their mail as spam
and does nothing to modify the original mail headers, this spam can be
reported in a number of different ways. Upcoming versions of Maia will
support detailed header analysis and semi-automated reporting to ISPs.
These reports help others block spam more effectively and even can result
in some form of punishment for the spammer.
</p><p>
Behind the scenes, Maia's automated scripts process the quarantine at
regular intervals, reporting confirmed spam to the same collaborative
networks that SpamAssassin consults&mdash;Vipul's Razor, Pyzor and the DCC. By
sharing this information with these networks, you give something back,
rather than only benefiting from the reports of others.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1753580.0x1843b20"></a>
An Effective, Comprehensive Solution</h2></div></div><p>
In the end, what matters most is how effective the combination of
amavisd-new and Maia Mailguard is at keeping spam out of your inbox, while
keeping ham out of your quarantine. From my own site's statistics, that
figure is a refreshing 99.22%, with 0.26% false positives and 0.52% false
negatives. Best of all, those false positives can be recovered easily from
the quarantine and the false negatives can be reported from the ham cache.
</p><p>
For viruses and other forms of malware, the effectiveness figure is even
more impressive: 100%. In the six months since I installed this content-filtering solution, the virus scanners on my desktop machines haven't
caught anything that slipped past the filters. This is largely due to
the way amavisd-new allows multiple virus scanners from different vendors
to be used together&mdash;what one scanner misses, another typically catches.
</p><p>
Performance-wise, any content-filtering solution is going to slow down mail
processing to some extent. It often becomes a trade-off between filter
effectiveness and speed, as you may choose to disable certain filters and
tests to improve mail throughput. My 99.22% effectiveness statistic comes
from having every available test and filter enabled, for example, but it
also costs 1&ndash;3 seconds to process each mail item on a moderately loaded
dual-PIII 733MHz with 1GB of RAM. A busier site might not be able to
tolerate that kind of delay. They would have to choose between disabling the
more time-consuming tests, upgrading the processor and RAM in the content
filter and switching to a load-balanced array of content filters.
Nevertheless, Maia Mailguard and amavisd-new are being used together at
sites hosting more than 50,000 users, processing more than 350,000 e-mails
a day, so the solution scales if you've got the hardware to handle it.
</p><p>
As many people already have discovered, some of the best weapons in the war
against spam and viruses happen to be open-source tools. With tools like
amavisd-new, Maia Mailguard, SpamAssassin and Clam Antivirus, you can
provide your network with world-class protection without spending tens of
thousands of dollars.
