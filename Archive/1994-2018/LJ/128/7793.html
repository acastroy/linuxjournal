Get started with video production, but keep
your eyes open for sticky situations.

We normally don't bother with those &ldquo;educational
use only&rdquo; disclaimers that other magazines slap
on every article that might possibly be used for
harm. Of course it's for educational use, and of
course you're responsible for your own actions.
But this issue, as we take on the tricky topic of
entertainment, consider this an extended disclaimer.
</p><p>
Olexiy Tykhomyrov and Denis Tonkonog
bring you an intro to Kino, a versatile
editing package that supports plugins and uses XML to
store its edit decision lists&mdash;the perfect tool for
dealing with the high-quality footage from a digital
camcorder (page 54). If you don't want to splash
out for a camcorder, Marcel Gagn&eacute; presents a smaller,
cheaper, Webcam-based studio on page 30.
</p><p>
But, we have to admit that this issue
is still missing a piece of the puzzle. Want to put
the MPEG-4 videos you produce on a Web site that
also has advertising? You'll need a lawyer and a
contract with the ominous MPEG Licensing Authority.
Where would the Web be if there were an &ldquo;HTML
Licensing Authority&rdquo;?
</p><p>
There is hope. Check out <a href="http://theora.org" target="_self">theora.org</a> for info on
the patent-free Theora video format, which you can
use as freely as HTML. We'll be bringing you more
how-tos on staying patent-free; in the meantime,
use MPEG for research only.
</p><p>
Although good news on software patents is still
scarce, the software community, on both the free
and proprietary sides, is aware of the danger and
moving to contain patent damage. The Internet
Engineering Task Force shut down its &ldquo;Mail Transfer
Agent Authentication in DNS&rdquo; working group because
of a threatened patent trap from one vendor. In the
long run, that's the right decision.
Meanwhile, the Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
Project, led by <i  >Linux Journal</i>
author Meng Weng Wong, is still going strong&mdash;and patent-free. Popular Linux distributions are
also scrupulous about leaving off patent-encumbered
software.
</p><p>
Readers were enthusiastic about Meng's spam-fighting
articles, so we're bringing you more. Clam AntiVirus came
out of the blue to win an Editors' Choice Award
for best security tool this year. With non-Linux
systems on the company network, your Linux mail server
needs to protect them from viruses too. Mick Bauer
gives you a detailed look at Clam on page 36, and
Robert LeBlanc shows how to integrate mail filtering
into an easy-to-manage system that lets users fish
their own false positives out of quarantine on page 84.
</p><p>
The software patent mess won't be over until
governments realize that they're a bad bargain&mdash;that the transaction costs and free speech risks
outweigh whatever benefits come from R&amp;D incentives.
While you keep your eyes open and your &ldquo;letter to
politicians&rdquo; template handy, and watch <a href="http://swpat.ffii.org" target="_self">swpat.ffii.org</a>
for things you can do for patent reform, don't forget
why you love digital freedom, and do some fun and
useful things with the great software in this issue.
