Dave Taylor's Article on getopt</h4><p>
Regarding Dave Taylor's &ldquo;Working with Command Arguments&rdquo; in
the February 2016 issue: it's a worthy article but let's expand on it a
bit. Long arguments like <tt  >--help</tt>
certainly deserve a mention.
</p><p>
But my main gripe with using getopt in bash is the lack of a wrapper
function. Python, C, C++, Ruby, etc., all have wrappers that simplify using
getopt enormously.
</p><p>
I help maintain hundreds of scripts at work (and home!), and I find the
biggest source of errors are those that creep in during maintenance.
</p><p>
The problem is that there are multiple places that need to be kept in
sync&mdash;the call to getopt itself, the case statement where the options are
processed and the help output that documents it all.
</p><p>
So&mdash;time for shameless self publicity&mdash;I wrote a wrapper for bash that
fixes this shortcoming. It's at
<a href="http://bhepple.com/doku/doku.php?id=argp.sh" target="_self">bhepple.com/doku/doku.php?id=argp.sh</a>.
</p><p>
To use it, you put all the information about the various options in a simple
variable (or here-document) and run a bit of mumbo-jumbo to process the
arguments. For that low, low price, you get the options parsed, a call made
to getopt and variables set for you as well as a help screen&mdash;all
automatically from the single source. Here's an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

    ARGS="
##############################################################
#OPTIONS:
#name=default sname arg       type range   description
##############################################################
CD=''         c     ''        b    ''      foobar
SLOT=''       s     'n'       s    ''      option that takes a value
TOKEN=''      t     'number'  s    ''      option that takes a value
LONG=''       ''    'long'    s    ''      a long option without a 
                                           short one
SILENT=''     ''    ''        b    ''
##############################################################
"
    exec 4&gt;&amp;1
    eval $(echo "$ARGS" | argp.sh "$@" 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;4 || echo exit $? )
    exec 4&gt;&amp;-

</pre>
</p><p>
That last bit looks scary, but it does the job&mdash;if the user invoked the
script with <tt  >-s 5</tt>, the bash variable
<tt  >SLOT</tt> has that value, etc., etc.
</p><p>
Hope it helps&mdash;it certainly has made my life much easier.

CSV Files and the Comma</h4><p>
This is with reference to Dave Taylor's article in the December 2015 issue about
dealing with CSV files. Yes, for people skilled with the power of the shell,
doing
taxes and such accounting things with scripting is very easy and full of
enjoyment. I do not know who invented the comma as a delimiter or the format
called &ldquo;csv&rdquo;. Instead, that person should have used tab as a
delimiter, and the format
should have been called &ldquo;tsv&rdquo;! I use tab as a delimiter (when exporting
from spreadsheets using OpenOffice) and face no problems whatsoever.
Besides ease of processing, the file becomes so much more readable with
the suitable tab-stop setting.

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Mayuresh, I love your suggestion, and you're right,
the use of any punctuation symbol that can occur within the data fields
themselves is really pretty stupid as a format. When I convert delimiters
back and forth, I use sequences like ^^ that are incredibly
unlikely to show up in any prose or data set.
</p><p>
More bizarre&mdash;CSV is a standards-body-approved format:
<a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml" target="_self">www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000323.shtml</a>.
</p><p>
My only comment: tabs can make things more readable, but if you've
wrestled with data where the fields vary from less than to greater than a
tab's width (typically eight characters), you know how annoying that can be
to align perfectly.
</p><p>
Thanks for writing in!

Does Every Year Have a Friday the 13th?</h4><p>
The &ldquo;Command-Line Tutorial&rdquo; in the February 2016 issue was a
fun article by Sol Lederman. It got me playing around with the commands, and I
started manually checking with <tt  >cal</tt> and
<tt  >cksum</tt> for unique leap years. When I found the
eighth unique one, I started to worry if the world was ending.
</p><p>
After digging around a bit, I discovered that my mis-matched pair was 2016
and
2044. For some reason, in Debian Jessie (32 and 64)&mdash;okay in Fedora
23&mdash;the year
2016 is generated in a strange fashion.
</p><p>
The numerical dates are displayed with digits separated by one or more spaces
(0x20) as appropriate, except for the prior and current date when the cal is
generated; in this case the 2nd, 3rd last night, and the 3rd, 4th this morning.
</p><p>
The date of generation and prior day's date are separated by
&ldquo;space&rdquo;,
&ldquo;underbar&rdquo;, &ldquo;backspace&rdquo; (0x20 0x5f 0x08)
sequences instead of just &ldquo;space&rdquo;. Now the
<tt  >cksum</tt> and <tt  >wc -c</tt> just went out the window and don't match anything, even though the
appearance of the two calendars is identical except for the year.
</p><p>
So I would surmise this applies to any Debian derivatives and only for the
current year, and possibly for only single-digit dates. I'll have to wait to see
what happens on a two-digit date! Perhaps it's a remnant of syntax to highlight the
current date.

I'm glad you had fun with the calendar puzzle. Thanks for pointing out
that different flavors of Linux render calendars differently. I ran into
differences as well, and pointed it out in the article, hoping to give
readers a heads up in case they got unexpected results. Perhaps other
readers will find even more differences. And, maybe the lesson here
is that a command as simple as <tt  >cal</tt> has different output on different
systems. Hopefully, others who run into different flavors of
<tt  >cal</tt> will
be inspired to dig in and figure out what's wrong as you did.
Happy computing!

Google Blocks the Inclusion of APNG in Blink/Chromium</h4><p>
I believe it's newsworthy that Google is effectively blocking the inclusion
of an already-ready patch to include APNG support in Chromium/Blink.
</p><p>
This reaction is so blatantly against the community and so clearly in
protection of Google's own WebP that nobody uses that I can't help but
clench my fists.
</p><p>
I would very much appreciate if you could spread the news to your readers
and colleagues so that the Internet may finally be free of the legacy of
GIF.

The Powers That Be</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;The Powers That Be&rdquo; in the February
2016 issue: I really liked the article; it reminded me of a similar problem we had a
few years ago. All of a sudden, every evening at 10pm our power would drop
for a moment, and every computer in the house would drop&mdash;no explanation. We
got the power company out, and they found nothing wrong with the line (but
they were testing only during the day). Anyhow, three visits later, I mentioned
the major hospital three blocks away, and I noticed that there was power-line
work happening on the main road. (We lived on a back street three streets from
the main road.) It turns out that while the power company had been doing power
work on the main line, they switched the power for the hospital's
incinerators to the sub-lines on the back streets and had forgotten to
switch them back. The problem was that the hospital incinerators were
auto-set to start every night at 10, and this was putting too much drain on
the line and causing minor drop outs. The moral: it pays to look around.

<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span>
I can only imagine your irritation! Great job figuring out what was causing
the problem. Finding a resolution like that is almost worth the frustration
it caused in the first place. Almost.

The Powers That Be, II</h4><p>
I had power problems like Shawn's in my house for some time. Although
the house was new in 2013, the power drop from the utility pole into
my electric meter was very old, as the previous house was demolished to
build a new one. I plugged an analog AC voltmeter in to an outlet and
watched the voltage fluctuate from 90 volts to 120 volts. My lights
would flicker also. After many months of this, I called the electric
company. They checked the connection at the utility pole end of my
drop and found a badly corroded splice. The lineman cut off the
corroded ends and made a new connection at the pole, and my problems
disappeared. This might be the cause of your problem. The fluctuations
were worse on windy days since the drop wires were swaying in the wind
making the fluctuations even more apparent.
</p><p>
I hope this helps.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Eric   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> Thanks for the
suggestion! During the next year, our city is moving overhead lines to under
ground. Hopefully during that process, the new lines will make for more
stable electricity. Of course, now it's a moot point for me, but still,
stability is nice!
