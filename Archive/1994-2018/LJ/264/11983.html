Gain a deep understanding of SSH port forwarding by implementing a
streaming video server on a BeagleBone Black.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x1cf31f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You probably have used SSH as a remote login shell, but you also can use SSH
in a number of unexpected but very useful applications. One such use is
tunnelling, or port forwarding, which is an effective method of accessing
networked hosts located behind routers, firewalls and NAT gateways.
As an added benefit, SSH encrypts the data passing through the tunnel,
increasing the security of your communications. This article shows you
how to set up stable and resilient SSH tunnels that will survive network
outages, computer reboots and idle connection timeouts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x1cf33b0"></a>
Understanding SSH Tunnelling</h2></div></div><p>
The SSH man page describes SSH as &ldquo;a program for logging into a
remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine...X11
connections and arbitrary TCP ports can also be forwarded over the
secure channel.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Starting at the socket level, let's take a look at how SSH 
forwards TCP
ports securely.
It's easiest to begin with an example. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11983f1.large.jpg"><img src="11983f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Data Path for TCP Packets Traveling between Hosts Charlie and Sam
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 illustrates the data path for TCP packets traveling between
hosts charlie and sam. In this example, the following command
was executed on charlie:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh -L 4444:127.0.0.1:5555 some_user@sam
</pre>
</p><p>
This command directs the SSH client on charlie to forward port 4444 to
port 5555 on sam. The <tt  >-L</tt> flag indicates that port 4444 is on the local
(or client) host, which, in this case, is charlie where the
<tt  >ssh</tt> command
was executed.
</p><p>
When this command runs, several actions take place:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The SSH program establishes a connection to sam using the default SSH
port 22.
</p></li><li><p>
The SSH process on charlie creates a server socket bound to localhost:4444
and begins listening.
</p></li><li><p>
When an arbitrary user process creates a client socket and connects
to the server socket at 4444, the SSH process encrypts the data, then
transmits it over the SSH connection (established in step 1) to sam.
</p></li><li><p>
The SSH server on sam decrypts the data.
</p></li><li><p>
The SSH server creates a client socket and writes the data to the
host and port specified in the SSH command, which, in this case, is
127.0.0.1:5555. 127.0.0.1 is, of course, the loopback or localhost address.
</p></li><li><p>
The arbitrary user server process on sam that created the server socket
bound to 5555 receives the data.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x1cf3da8"></a>
Understanding SSH Commands</h2></div></div><p>
The location of the server socket and client socket is key to
understanding how SSH tunnels work. As Figure 1 shows, SSH tunnels
always result in the creation of a client and server socket. In a
forward tunnel, the local host creates the server socket and the remote
host creates the client socket. In a reverse tunnel, the local host creates the
client socket and the remote host creates the server socket. The local host is
the machine where the SSH command was executed.
</p><p>
The remote host to which the port is forwarded does not have to be the
SSH server. Consider the following command executed on charlie:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh -L 1234:www.some_website.com:80 some_user@SAM
</pre>
</p><p>
In this instance, charlie creates a server socket bound to port 1234.
If you run a Web browser on charlie and point it to localhost:1234, SSH
securely forwards the connection to sam, where the SSH server there creates
a client socket and connects to the Web server at some_website.com.
This command can be used to connect to a server from a private network
on which it is blocked.
</p><p>
Reverse SSH tunnels work exactly the same way, except that the remote
host creates the server socket and the local host creates the client socket.
The <tt  >-R</tt> option instructs the SSH process to create a
reverse tunnel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh -R 1234:www.some_website.com:80 some_user@SAM
</pre>
</p><p>
This command executed on charlie creates a server socket on sam at
port 1234. A browser running on sam and connecting to port 1234 on
sam would have its traffic encrypted and routed to charlie, and thence
to some_website.com.
</p><p>
One source of confusion when using 127.0.0.1 (or localhost) in port-forwarding commands is determining which host is the localhost from the
point of view of the tunnel. One way to resolve where localhost refers
is to remember that a client socket at the end of the tunnel is used
to connect to the specified host; thus, localhost is the machine that
creates the client socket. For forward tunnels, 127.0.0.1 refers to
the remote SSH server, and for reverse tunnels, 127.0.0.1 refers to the
client machine where the SSH command executes.
</p><p>
Now, let's look at using 
SSH tunnelling to stream video from a BeagleBone
Black. An Amazon Web server, configured with a public static IP
will serve as a relay where the video can be viewed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x1cf4278"></a>
Amazon Web Server Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Follow these steps to create and configure an EC2 instance. Amazon has
an excellent set of instructions on its Web site documenting each step
if you encounter problems.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Sign up for an AWS account at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free" target="_self">https://aws.amazon.com/free</a>. (The AWS
Free Tier is free for one year at the time of this writing; however, be aware
that if you exceed the bandwidth limit, it will trigger charges to your
credit card.)
</p></li><li><p>
Open the EC2 dashboard by clicking on the &ldquo;EC2 virtual servers in
the cloud&rdquo; tab and create an EC2 instance. Select the Ubuntu Server 14.04
LTS (HVM) image. Note carefully the location of the downloaded private key
file (.pem), as you will need it to <tt  >ssh</tt> in to your EC2 instance.
</p></li><li><p>
Assign a public static IP to your instance using the Elastic IP tab
under the EC2 dashboard.
</p></li><li><p>
Open port 5555 on your instance by creating a new security group. 
</p></li><li><p>
Assign the newly created security group to your instance.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The final step is to configure the keep-alive time for the SSH server.
Append the following lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config (note: it is
sshd_config, not ssh_config):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
ClientAliveCountMax 3
ClientAliveInterval 60
</pre>
</p><p>
Then reboot:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >ClientAliveInterval</tt> is a timeout interval. If a connection has been idle
for <tt  >ClientAliveInterval</tt> seconds, the sshd server will send a message through
the encrypted channel to request a response from the client.
</p><p>
<tt  >ClientAliveCountMax</tt> sets the maximum number of
client alive messages, which
may be sent without any client response. If this threshold is reached, sshd
will disconnect the client, terminating the session.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x1cf4b68"></a>
BeagleBone Black Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Many intermittent BeagleBone Black problems can be resolved by using a 5V
2A DC power supply instead of powering the BeagleBone over USB. Likewise,
it is safer to use a powered USB hub when connecting multiple USB devices.
</p><p>
I used a BeagleBone Black Rev C to complete the steps outlined in this
article. The default Debian image as shipped at the time of this
writing was Debian GNU/Linux 7.4 (wheezy):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description: Debian GNU/Linux 7.4 (wheezy)
Release: 7.4
Codename: wheezy
</pre>
</p><p>
The kernel was upgraded to 3.8.13-bone79 using the built-in script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /opt/scripts/tools/
$ git pull
$ sudo ./update_kernel.sh
$ sudo reboot

$ uname -r
3.8.13-bone79
</pre>
</p><p>
I used a Logitech HD Webcam C270 for the USB Webcam.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x20ed078"></a>
Installing mjpg-streamer</h2></div></div><p>
To complete these steps, ensure that your BeagleBone has a live Internet connection. 
Log in to your BeagleBone and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd
$ wget https://github.com/shrkey/mjpg-streamer/raw/master/
&#8618;mjpg-streamer.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf ./mjpg-streamer.tar.gz
$ cd mjpg-streamer
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that in the following scripts and commands you must replace
<tt  >my_beagle</tt>
with its IP address.
</p><p>
Plug in your Webcam. You can use <tt  >lsusb</tt> to check that it has enumerated
properly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 046d:0825 Logitech, Inc. Webcam C270
</pre>
</p><p>
If the Webcam doesn't enumerate, leave it connected and reboot the
BeagleBone.
</p><p>
Start mjpg_streamer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./mjpg_streamer -i "./input_uvc.so" -o "./output_http.so 
 &#8618;-w ./www -p 8090"
</pre>
</p><p>
Check whether the BeagleBone is streaming video by opening a browser in a host
on the same network as the BeagleBone and browse to
http://my_beagle:8090/?action=stream.
</p><p>
Now, create a script to start mjpg_streamer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd 
$ mkdir scripts
$ cd scripts
$ vi mjpg_streamer.sh
#!/bin/bash
if ! pgrep -f /home/debian/mjpg-streamer/mjpg_streamer 
then /home/debian/mjpg-streamer/mjpg_streamer -i "/home/debian/
&#8618;mjpg-streamer/input_uvc.so --resolution QVGA " -o 
 &#8618;"/home/debian/mjpg-streamer/output_http.so -w 
 &#8618;/home/debian/mjpg-streamer/www -p 8090"
fi
$ chmod +x mjpg_streamer.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Create a cronjob that checks whether mjpg_streamer is running once per minute:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ crontab -e
* * * * * /home/debian/scripts/mjpg_streamer.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, the video server is running on port 8090 with QVGA
resolution and will restart automatically when the BeagleBone is rebooted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x20ed6a8"></a>
SSH Setup</h2></div></div><p>
To <tt  >ssh</tt> in to your EC2 instance, you will need to copy the private key to the
BeagleBone. The private key is the .pem file that you downloaded when
configuring the EC2 instance. You can copy the private key to the
BeagleBone using <tt  >scp</tt> (which coincidentally also uses the SSH protocol) to
transfer files between hosts. So from the computer where you downloaded
the private key, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ scp my_private_key.pem debian@my_beagle: ~/
</pre>
</p><p>
Now log in to the BeagleBone and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 0400 my_private_key.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, look up the public IP of my_amazon. The public IP for my_amazon can
be found in the Elastic IP tabs in the AWS console.
</p><p>
Test that you can <tt  >ssh</tt> in to your EC2 instance by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh ubuntu@my_amazon -i my_private_key.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
To make things easier, let's set up an alias to store the EC2 information.
Append these lines to the end of /etc/ssh/ssh_config:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo vi  /etc/ssh/ssh_config

Host ec2
        HostName my_amazon
        IdentityFile  /home/debian/my_private_key.pem
        User ubuntu
        ServerAliveInterval 60          
        ServerAliveCountMax 2 
</pre>
</p><p>
Replace my_amazon with its public IP address. 
</p><p>
The <tt  >ServerAliveInterval</tt> and
<tt  >ServerAliveCountMax</tt> are the client-side analogs
to <tt  >ClientAliveInterval</tt> and
<tt  >ClientAliveCountMax</tt>. They function in exactly
the same way.
</p><p>
Now typing the following should log you in to your EC2 instance:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh ec2 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x20ede38"></a>
autossh Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Many how-tos explain how to use SSH commands for port forwarding but fail
to describe how to keep the SSH tunnel alive. One common challenge in
keeping network connections up is managing the router or firewall inactive
connection timeout. Routers often will close a connection if it is idle
for a certain period, sometimes closing a connection if it is idle for as
few as five minutes. Server reboots and network outages also obviously
can kill the tunnel.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is a ready-made utility that monitors SSH connections and
restarts them when they die: autossh. The
<tt  >ServerAlive</tt> configuration flags
you added to send a packet periodically through the tunnel will defeat the
inactive connection timeout.
</p><p>
Install autossh on my_beagle by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install autossh
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's
write a startup script that launches autossh at boot time using the
<tt  >init.d</tt> facilities. Create a script named tunnel in
/etc/init.d:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ sudo vi /etc/init.d/tunnel

#!/bin/bash
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          tunnel
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $named
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $named
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start/stop  ssh tunnel
### END INIT INFO

set -e #abort at first error
LOGFILE=/home/debian/my_autossh.log
export AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0  #Prevents autossh from exiting if first 
                           #attempt  fails
export AUTOSSH_PIDFILE=/home/debian/my_autossh.pid 

case $1 in
 start)
  su -c "date &gt;&gt;$LOGFILE; autossh -M 0 -N -R 5555:localhost:8090 
 &#8618;ec2 &amp;&gt;&gt;$LOGFILE" -s /bin/bash debian
 ;;
 stop)
  if [ -e $AUTOSSH_PIDFILE ] 
   then
   kill -9 `cat $AUTOSSH_PIDFILE`
  fi
 ;;
 *)
  echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/tunnel {start|stop|}"
  exit 1
 ;;
esac

$ sudo chmod +x tunnel
$ sudo update-rc.d tunnel defaults
$ sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x20ee200"></a>
PC Setup</h2></div></div><p>
Since this is a video streaming application, it is likely that you want to
view the video stream on different computers. This can be achieved by
allowing the sshd server on your AWS server to forward connections from any
host (and by setting a password on mjpg_streamer for security). I'll
explain 
how to do that shortly; however, this exposes mjpg_streamer to brute-force password attacks. The intruder would only be able to view the video
stream, but that may not be desirable.
</p><p>
One alternative is to create a forward tunnel and stream the encrypted
video over this tunnel. This requires installing the private key on
whatever machine you are viewing from, as well as setting up the tunnel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x20ee360"></a>
Secure Video Streaming</h2></div></div><p>
To reduce typing, create an alias for your EC2 as you did on
my_beagle:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install autossh
$ vi ~/.ssh/config
Host ec2
        HostName my_amazon
        IdentityFile  path_to/my_private_key.pem
        User ubuntu
        ServerAliveInterval 60          
        ServerAliveCountMax 2
</pre>
</p><p>
The command to create a forward tunnel to my_amazon is the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh -L 1234:localhost:5555 ec2
</pre>
</p><p>
The choice of the local server port (1234) is arbitrary; it can be any
port. Port numbers under 1024 will require root access, however.
</p><p>
Once this command is executed, start a browser and open
http://127.0.0.1:1234/?action=stream.
</p><p>
You should see the live video stream from the Webcam on my_beagle.
</p><p>
You can make this tunnel permanent by adding a startup script following the
same model as before:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ sudo vi /etc/init.d/forwardtunnel
#!/bin/bash
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          forwardtunnel
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $named
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog $named
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start/stop  ssh forwardtunnel
### END INIT INFO

set -e #abort at first error
LOGFILE=/home/your_username/my_autossh.log  # CHANGE YOUR_USERNAME!!
export AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0 #Prevents autossh from exiting if 
 &#8618;first attempt fails
export AUTOSSH_PIDFILE=/home/your_username/my_autossh.pid # CHANGE 
 &#8618;YOUR_USERNAME!!

case $1 in
 start)
  su -c "date &gt;&gt;$LOGFILE; autossh -M 0 -N -L 1234:localhost:5555 
 &#8618;ec2 &amp;&gt;&gt;$LOGFILE" -s /bin/bash your_username# CHANGE YOUR_USERNAME!!
 ;;
 stop)
  if [ -e $AUTOSSH_PIDFILE ] 
   then
   kill -9 `cat $AUTOSSH_PIDFILE`
  fi
 ;;
 *)
  echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/forwardtunnel {start|stop|}"
  exit 1
 ;;
esac

$ sudo chmod +x forwardtunnel
$ sudo update-rc.d forwardtunnel defaults
$ sudo shutdown -r now
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that you will have to change <tt  >your_username</tt> in the above to your user name.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bfb580.0x20ee7d8"></a>
Unsecured Video Streaming</h2></div></div><p>
Unsecured video streaming permits anyone with the correct user name and
password to connect to the mjpg_streamer server and view the video stream.
Although mjpg_streamer has password protection, it is vulnerable to
brute-force attacks. However, the convenience of viewing the video stream from
any platform without the private key and without setting up a forward
tunnel may be worth it.
</p><p>
First, let's add some security by requiring anyone viewing the Webcam to
authenticate with the correct user name and password by using the
authentication option to mjpg_streamer.
</p><p>
On the BeagleBone:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ vi /home/debian/scripts/mjpg_streamer.sh
#!/bin/bash
if ! pgrep -f /home/debian/mjpg-streamer/mjpg_streamer 
then /home/debian/mjpg-streamer/mjpg_streamer -i "/home/debian/
&#8618;mjpg-streamer/input_uvc.so" -o "/home/debian/mjpg-streamer/
&#8618;output_http.so -w /home/debian/mjpg-streamer/www -p 8090 
 &#8618;--resolution QVGA -c userNamE:Passw0rd"
fi
$ shutdown -r now
</pre>
</p><p>
Change <tt  >userNamE:Passw0rd</tt> to one of your own invention. The user name is
unrelated to any account on your BeagleBone.
</p><p>
The second change is to set the <tt  >GatewayPorts</tt> flag to yes on the Amazon Web
server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
ClientAliveCountMax 3
ClientAliveInterval 60
GatewayPorts yes
# service ssh restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the SSH tunnels are re-established, browsing to
my_amazon:5555/?action=stream will open the video stream after entering the
correct user name and password. The <tt  >GatewayPorts</tt>
flag controls whether the sshd
server forwards connections from external hosts (<tt  >GatewayPorts
yes</tt>) or only
from localhost (<tt  >GatewayPorts no</tt>).

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I have described how to set up secure and reliable SSH tunnels,
explained the
underlying mechanism behind SSH tunnelling and implemented a secure video
streaming server accessible from external networks without requiring any
router or firewall changes. Another configuration you might explore is a
tunnel to an sshd server on your BeagleBone. With this tunnel, you could
log in remotely from any external network. Happy tunnelling!
