<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #264, April 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Sometimes if you want to stop maintaining a piece of software but no one
will take it over, all you have to do is simply announce that you're
stepping down, and everyone will jump for it.
</p><p>
That was <span   class="bold"><b>Neil Brown</b></span>'s experience with
<span   class="bold"><b>software RAID</b></span>. After 15 years as
maintainer, he wanted out, but he couldn't get anyone to commit to take it
over. So, he announced his departure and offered up a description of what
he saw for software RAID going forward: a small team of maintainers who
would gather and review patches, resolve bugs and feed patches upstream. 
</p><p>
Lo and behold, lots of people expressed interest in taking over
maintainership or at least in participating in a team. After sifting
through many volunteers, he settled on <span   class="bold"><b>Jes
Sorensen</b></span> for <span   class="bold"><b>mdadm</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Shaohua
Li</b></span> for the <span   class="bold"><b>kernel/md</b></span> side of things. Neil documented some of the basics for
Jes and Shaohua to consider, saying:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The first question is where do you
send your patches to get the appropriate review and upstream acceptance.
Alasdair or Mike (DM), Jens (Block), Andrew Morton (anything) and Linus
(everything) are all defensible choices for upstreaming (I've submitted
through Andrew in the past, but through Linus exclusively once I figured
out git). That is really something you and they would need to negotiate
though. [...] I plan to submit a pull request to Linus for the 4.5 merge
window and then stop queuing patches.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And Jes also announced a new git tree for mdadm, at
<a href="http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git" target="_self">git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git</a>.
</p><p>
Kernel documentation has traditionally been written in <span   class="bold"><b>DocBook</b></span>, an
XML-based system that's been falling behind the increasingly popular forms
of readable markup, like <span   class="bold"><b>Markdown</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>AsciiDoc</b></span> and others. Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Jonathan
Corbet</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Jani Nikula</b></span> did some overlapping work to convert the kernel to
use AsciiDoc for all documentation.
</p><p>
The goal was not just to adopt the new hotness, but also to reduce some of
the many tool dependencies that were needed for DocBook processing and 
speed up overall doc production. Along the way, however, any new system
would have to be at least as good as DocBook and support large files,
cross references, a big pile of output formats and so on.
</p><p>
There turned out to be significant problems doing the whole migration. One
of the most viable options, at least temporarily, turned out to be
migrating the source files to AsciiDoc, but having the makefiles process
that into DocBook and from there into whatever output was needed. This
would not reduce the number of tool dependencies, but it would at least
produce reliable output, while accepting the new more preferable input.
</p><p>
Ultimately, DocBook would be eliminated, but for now it seems there will be
this intermediate step. It's also possible that AsciiDoc would need to be
modified upstream, before it would be able to handle the kernel docs
without DocBook fully.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Seeing Red and Getting Sleep</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #264, April 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'm always leery when I hear, &ldquo;Recent studies show...&rdquo;. But the idea that
looking at electronic device screens before bed can cause sleep issues
seems to be fairly accepted. The fascinating part for me is that it isn't
really the screen itself, but the blue part of the color spectrum that
contributes to the sleeplessness. In a purely anecdotal experiment, I
find that it's much more difficult for me to fall asleep in the kitchen
(cool-colored lighting, closer to blue in the spectrum) than it is to
fall asleep on the living-room couch (warmer, less blue lights). Granted,
part of that might be general comfort on the couch and more sharp objects
in the kitchen, but in general, warmer lighting tends to be more relaxing.
</p><p>
Based on the idea that less blue and more red will make for better
sleeping, the &ldquo;Twilight&rdquo; app for Android shifts the color of your screen
as bedtime approaches. It's free for basic functionality, but for a small
price, you can get a timed, gradual transition on your Android devices.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11995androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995androidf2.large.jpg"><img src="11995androidf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I have no idea whether it helps me sleep better, but if nothing else, it
reminds me that it's getting late as my ebook becomes redder and redder as
I read. If you struggle with sleeplessness especially when you first go
to bed, give Twilight a try. It's free in the Google Play Store, and if
it works, the gradual shift option with the paid version is well worth
the cost. And as a bonus, the red screen won't hinder your night vision
during those late evenings of summer stargazing!

<h2 class="title">Back to Backups</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #264, April 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my Open-Source Classroom column last month [&ldquo;Back It Up,
Buster&rdquo;, March 2016], I talked about backups and got some really fascinating
feedback. In fact, at the time of this writing, it's still pretty early in
the month, so I expect to get even more ideas and suggestions for backup
options. Here's a few of the ideas worth checking into:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Carlos Baptista</b></span> wrote in as someone who
also has struggled with lost
data. His current solution is to use rsnapshot (<a href="http://rsnapshot.org" target="_self">rsnapshot.org</a>)
on a pair of 4TB drives. Every week he swaps the drives, taking one to
his parent's house. This solution gives him low-tech off-site storage, a maximum of
one week of lost data in the event of a total failure, plus an excuse to
visit his parents on a regular basis. Awesome job!
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Harald Nipen</b></span> takes the interesting step of making sure the duplication
process for his backups is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automated. That may seem like a silly
thing to do, but as someone who accidentally reversed the source and
destination on his rsync backup script before, I can assure you there
is some peace of mind that comes from manually seeing your backup take
place. Harald does, of course, automate his regular backups, but the
duplication process for off-site storage is a manual process using the
unison program.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nicola Larosa</b></span> pointed me to an interesting project that
uses &ldquo;content-defined chunking&rdquo; to back up
data efficiently. It's the fastest backup system he's ever used and
worth checking out if you have large amounts of data to
secure: <a href="http://restic.github.io/blog/2015-09-12/restic-foundation1-cdc" target="_self">restic.github.io/blog/2015-09-12/restic-foundation1-cdc</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally (for now), <span   class="bold"><b>Johann Schoonees</b></span> wrote in about rdiff-backup. It's
a program I'd heard of but never really looked into using. That's
unfortunate though, because it really is a neat concept. If you've ever
used BackupPC to keep rsync snapshots hard-linked to save space, it's
a little like that. The program is an all-in-one solution, however,
that keeps a current snapshot of a filesystem while also keeping diff
files of previous changes. That allows older versions of files to be
recovered without the complexity of setting up the entire BackupPC system.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The most encouraging part about getting followup e-mail messages from readers
about their backup solutions is to hear that lots of folks actually have backup
solutions! Regardless of the complexity of your backup process or
the level of automation you deem appropriate for your data, apart
from creating the memories in the first place, few things are as
important as backing them up!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Caffeine!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #264, April 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Okay, this program is free (beer), but not Free (speech). I wouldn't
normally include a freeware application in the &ldquo;Non-Linux
FOSS&rdquo; section,
because quite frankly, it isn't FOSS. But, I decided to break the
rules a bit here because I realized how often I use a freeware program when
I'm on OS X that I couldn't imagine doing without.
</p><p>
If you use OS X for presentations or demonstrations, you've probably had
your screen shut off while you explained a slide or dialog box. Then
the screen probably locked, and you had to hurry over to the keyboard so
you could unlock, and so on and so on. Caffeine is a simple app that does nothing
more than keep your Macintosh (or Hackintosh) computer awake. It runs
as a cute little icon in your menu bar, and it disables screen savers and
sleep mode, even if you have aggressive power-saving settings enabled.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11995fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The danger is that you could leave Caffeine running accidentally and
completely drain your battery. I've had that happen only one time,
however, and I learned quickly to take my computer off Caffeine
when I was done presenting. Even with that risk, I find it's worth it to
no longer need to wiggle the mouse pointer every minute to make sure my laptop
doesn't fall asleep!
</p><p>
Caffeine is available for free in the App Store, or you can get it from
its Web site: <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine" target="_self">lightheadsw.com/caffeine</a>.

<h2 class="title">My +1 Sword of Productivity</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #264, April 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If I'm being completely honest, I think the game-ification of a daily task
list is a dumb idea. I also love it, and can't stress enough how well
it works. Habitica might just be the way I get things done from now on.
</p><p>
I'm a perfectionist. If you've ever seen photos of my office (or
hairdo), you might not think that's the case, but I assure you, it's
true. Unfortunately, one of the big side effects of being a perfectionist
is procrastination. Not laziness, but delaying or redoing tasks until
you can get them just right. It can be crippling for productivity, and
ironically, the rushed product that results often is sub-par to what
would have been created in the first place.
</p><p>
Habitica turns the struggles with perfectionism back on the
perfectionist. Although I honestly don't care very much about the swords and
shields I earn by completing tasks, for some reason, the idea of losing
HP for skipping a task is difficult for me to accept. I find myself
doing extra &ldquo;good habits&rdquo; throughout the day just so my character is
as good as he can be. Honestly, I'm surprised Habitica works for me. I
still think it's dumb. I also can't stop striving for new experience
levels and early task completions.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995habitf1.large.jpg"><img src="11995habitf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
There's a great Web version of the free program at <a href="http://habitica.com" target="_self">habitica.com</a>,
plus you can get mobile versions for iOS or Android via their respective
app stores. In fact, Habitica is so unique and surprisingly effective,
it's easily my pick for Editors' Choice this month. If you think it
sounds like a dumb idea, I completely agree. I also urge you to try it,
because I find it incredibly awesome!

<h2 class="title">Night Sky Tools on Android</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #264, April 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In previous articles, I've looked at several different astronomy
programs that you can run on your Linux machines. Those are great when you
are doing work indoors, but most laptops and Netbooks are still a bit of a
pain to carry around with you if you are going out into the field. In those
cases, having something more portable is definitely nice. And, since
I'm beginning to look at Android apps in this column, this is a
perfect opportunity. Loads of astronomy applications are available
within the Android environment that are well worth a look. In this article
in particular, I'm exploring Night Sky Tools. The application
is available in the Google Play store, and it should run on most versions
of Android.
</p><p>
Once you have it installed, open it to see a very complete menu
of all of the functionality available within Night Sky Tools.
Many of the functions are updated over the
Internet automatically, so you are sure to have the latest information for whatever
objects you are trying to observe in the night sky. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf1.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The opening screen displays a menu of the various categories of
functions available.
</p></div></div><p>
The first category
is general astronomical information. You can see lists of upcoming
astronomical events, as well as what is up right now and what will be
coming up tonight. There also are entries for a compass and a page of the
various astronomical times that you may need. The astronomical time page
gives the moonrise/moonset and sunrise/sunset times. There 
even is a page that lets you calculate the visual limiting magnitude based
on the actual environmental conditions like temperature and humidity. The
last page in this section is the sky map. The information
provided in the sky map is rather complete. You can see the stars and
constellations, along with the formal constellation boundaries. It 
even displays artwork for each of the constellations, showing you what
they are supposed to look like.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf2.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The sky map provides a display of what the sky looks like at the
current time.
</p></div></div><p>
The next section has information on the Earth and Moon. (Note: when moving
between sections, be aware that the other sections do not
automatically close.)
You also can pull up a daylight map, showing what parts of the
Earth are in daylight and which are in night. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf3.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The daylight map shows you where on Earth it is day and night.
</p></div></div><p>
There are pages
that show when the solar and lunar eclipse happen,
along with dates for the equinoxes and solstices. The meteor page
gives a listing of all of the known meteor showers, with the start,
peak and end dates. It also, helpfully, gives the percentage of the
moon phase so that you can tell right away whether the night will be
dark enough to have a good observing period. The moon map, by default,
shows a full listing of sites of interest. Tapping on one
of these points brings up a text label with the name of the site.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf4.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The moon map shows points of interest with pins on the map.
</p></div></div><p>
The solar system category extends available information farther out into
space. The Conjunction/Opposition page provides a list of all times this
year when planets either form a conjunction or an opposition. There are
two pages, one for comets and one for near-Earth asteroids, where you can
search for detailed information on specific comets or asteroids. You
also can click the update button to pull a fresh listing from the
Internet of what objects are known. 
</p><p>
There are four large moons 
orbiting Jupiter that are visible in a large pair of binoculars. Clicking
on the Jupiter's Moons page brings up a map of their relative locations
around Jupiter. A related page gives you the
positions of the largest of Saturn's moons too. Viewing them will
require at least a small telescope though. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf5.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You can get a map of the locations of the four main Jovian moons.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf6.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can get a map of the largest of Saturn's moons as well.
</p></div></div><p>
The Planetary Orbits page
takes things even farther out to see the relative positions of all of
the planets within the solar system. As with the Moon map
described previously, this section includes a Mars map, also with pins at
locations of interest. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf7.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The relative locations of all of the planets are available on the
Planetary Orbits page.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf8.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. There is a Mars map with locations of interest.
</p></div></div><p>
The stars category takes you even farther out into space. The first
selection provides a list of the 300 brightest stars in the sky. The list
includes the name, magnitude and location for each of these stars. The
entire sky is divided up into constellations. The constellations page
pulls up detailed information for the selected constellation. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf9.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You can get detailed information on constellations, including a map.
</p></div></div><p>
There also are pages with theoretical information about
astronomy. For example, you can pull up a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram
showing how stars are categorized. The stellar classification
page describes the ten classes of stars with their temperature,
mass, radius and luminosity characteristics. The last two pages in this
section let you search for information on variable stars
and visual binary stars.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf10.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows how stars are categorized.
</p></div></div><p>
The deep sky section contains pages for several of the deep sky
catalogs. The Caldwell and Messier catalogs are displayed as a list
of all of the objects within the catalog. You can click on an object
of interest and pull up detailed information for it. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11995nightf11.large.jpg"><img src="11995nightf11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. You can get detailed information on Messier catalog objects.
</p></div></div><p>
There
also are sections where you can do searches for exoplanets and NGC/IC
catalog objects. The remainder of the sections provide functions to do
common astronomy calculations. You can handle
coordinate calculations, astrophotography and telescope calculations. 
</p><p>
The
observation log helps you track your own information. There is a page
to manage all of your astronomical equipment, like telescopes, eyepieces,
filters and cameras. You also can log all of your observations, recording
all of the details of interest. You
can export your log, including whatever sections you need, so that you
can incorporate it into some other database of your research.
</p><p>
Now you have no excuse for not going out and exploring
the skies above you. In my next few articles, I plan to look at several
other scientific applications that you can use on your Android devices
for doing portable science.
