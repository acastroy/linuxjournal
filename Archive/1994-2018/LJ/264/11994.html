Dave describes a super-useful scripting
command stolen from the C standard I/O library.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf60580.0x10583b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I explored the surprising ability of the Linux shell to convert
numeric bases on the fly, including this sweet little snippet that converts
FF hexadecimal into decimal notation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $(( 0xFF ))
255
</pre>
</p><p>
And, I discussed how you even could use the handy
<tt  >printf</tt> command within scripts too,
such as this command to display decimal numbers in octal and hexadecimal:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "octal: %o\nhex: %x\n" 42 42
octal: 52
hex: 2a
</pre>
</p><p>
It's pretty neat stuff, but to be honest, I rarely find myself needing
to convert numeric bases nowadays, so it's really something I file
under &ldquo;funky shell tricks&rdquo;. Your experience may be different, so
it's still well worth learning anyway.
</p><p>
In this article, I thought it would be interesting to take a closer look at the
<tt  >printf</tt> command, because it is so darn powerful, but
before going there, here's a
quickie: some neat ways you can make your if-then statements be more
succinct.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf60580.0x1058828"></a>
If/Then Statements</h2></div></div><p>
If you're like me, then you find yourself frequently writing
conditional statement blocks in your shell scripts. Um, I mean:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ you're like me ] ; then
   you find yourself...
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, you get the idea. In fact, conditional expressions are where
sequences of code turn into more sophisticated programs, whether
they're a half-dozen lines long or hundreds of lines.
</p><p>
A typical conditional expression actually might look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $(date +%w) -eq 0 ]; then
   echo "It's Sunday"
else
   echo "It's not Sunday"
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
This is clear and readable, but it sure takes up a lot of vertical space in
a shell script.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there are some ways you can tighten up things by using the
&amp;&amp;
and || notations in your shell scripts.
</p><p>
The &amp;&amp; notation means if what's invoked prior to the &amp;&amp; ends with a
success return code, do what's subsequent&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

test $(date +%w) -eq 0 &amp;&amp; echo "Sunday"

</pre>
</p><p>
If it's Monday afternoon when I run this code, I'll get no output,
and the echo statement isn't even evaluated. But if it's Sunday,
the above command will output appropriately.
</p><p>
The || notation offers the same basic functionality but with the opposite
logic: if the return code of the command prior to the || returns a fail
(non-zero) return code, then the subsequent command will be invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
test $(date +%w) -eq 0 || echo "It's not Sunday yet"
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can make this even more succinct by using the [] notational
shortcut for a test&mdash;just remember to include the closing ] to ensure
it's all well formed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[ $(date +%w -eq 0 ] || echo "it's not Sunday yet"
</pre>
</p><p>
The biggest limitation with this notation is that there's really no
reliable and properly interpreted way to add an else clause. 
</p><p>
You can try something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cmd1 &amp;&amp; cmd2 || cmd3

</pre>
</p><p>
But because of precedence interpretation, it's likely to have cmd3
invoked if either cmd1 or cmd2 have a non-zero return code, which makes it
functionality different from this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if cmd1 ; then
  cmd2
else
  cmd3
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
All is not lost, however, because you always can use a lot of semicolons to
move that onto a single line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if cmd1 ; then cmd2 ; else cmd3 ; fi
</pre>
</p><p>
But, is it more readable? Is it really how you want to write your commands?
Maybe. At least now you know!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf60580.0x10590c0"></a>
The Ever-Helpful printf Command</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's look at a completely different type of command,
a command that is a built-in C programming language function that's so
darn useful, it's now included in Linux as a standalone command.
</p><p>
In C and its brethren, the command shows up like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
printf(formatstring, arg, arg);
</pre>
</p><p>
This actually is a shortcut for the more general
<tt  >fprintf()</tt> command, which
prepends the file handle and would look more like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fprintf(stdio, formatstring, arg, arg);
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not really relevant to this discussion, but hey, you should know this C
programming nuance just so you know what's going on, right? 
</p><p>
Okay, okay, back to the shell.
</p><p>
The <tt  >printf</tt> command is basically the same, just without the parentheses and
commas:

<pre     class="programlisting">
printf formatstring arg arg
</pre>
</p><p>
Unlike the <tt  >echo</tt> command,
<tt  >printf</tt> doesn't automatically append a
carriage-return line-feed sequence, so you can end up with odd results like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "hello"
hello$
</pre>
</p><p>
The format string allows a number of backslash-escaped sequences to
alleviate this problem, notably <tt  >\n</tt> to produce the end-of-line carriage
return.
</p><p>
Indeed, go back to the first few paragraphs of this column, and you'll
notice I included this sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
printf "octal: %o\nhex: %x\n" 42 42
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you know what those <tt  >\n</tt> sequences mean: each
produces an end-of-line
sequence.
</p><p>
Additional escape sequences include <tt  >\a</tt> for a bell
(try it!), <tt  >\b</tt> for a
backspace, <tt  >\t</tt> for a tab and
<tt  >\\</tt> for a backslash character itself.
</p><p>
Where things get more interesting is with the specifics of the format
string. All of these are denoted with the % symbol followed by the specific
letter that specifies how the associated argument should be interpreted and
displayed. Give it a decimal value but use <tt  >%o</tt>, and it'll be output as
octal (as shown earlier).
</p><p>
The most important sequences are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >%c</tt> for a character.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >%s</tt> for a string (a sequence of characters).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >%d</tt> for a decimal value.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >%f</tt> for a floating-point non-integer value.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are nuances, of course, and in particular, displaying floating-point
numbers can be quite complicated because of the various notational
conventions used. You can read the <tt  >printf</tt> man page for much more detail on
that.
</p><p>
Just about every format sequence also allows you to specify a field width
and a precision, which is where all of this gets both complicated and
interesting.
</p><p>
Let's consider the floating-point number 3.141597 and how
<tt  >printf</tt> might
display it in different ways:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pi=3.141597
$ printf "%d\n" $pi
-bash: printf: 3.141597: invalid number
0
</pre>
</p><p>
That shouldn't be a surprise; you can't interpret a floating-point
number as an integer. Use <tt  >%f</tt> instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "%f\n" $pi
3.141597
</pre>
</p><p>
That's the default, and <tt  >printf</tt> is showing its default precision for the
floating-point value.
</p><p>
Let's see what happens if you specify a zero precision (that is, zero
digits subsequent to the decimal point):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "%.0f\n" $pi
3
</pre>
</p><p>
That makes sense. But, what if it's actually currency you're working with
and you want to be able to ensure that you don't get weird values like
$20.4342434 as a value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "%.2f\n" $pi
3.14
</pre>
</p><p>
Where this really gets interesting is when you want to line up values in
columns, allocating 10, 15, 20 or more characters of space per field.
That's the field width, and it appears prior to the decimal point on the
formatting string specifier or by itself if there's no decimal point:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "X%15fX\n" $pi
X       3.141597X
</pre>
</p><p>
You can combine things too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "X%10.2fX\n" $pi
X      3.14X
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use field width specifiers with strings, which is particularly
interesting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ printf "|%20s|%20s|\n" "one" "two"; printf "|%20s|%20s|\n"
"three" "four"
|                 one|                 two|
|               three|                four|
$
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm running out of space, but I encourage you to check out
the <tt  >printf</tt> command and its many tricks to help you create more attractive
output from your shell scripts!
