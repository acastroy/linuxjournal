Never get lost at the command line again.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1093580.0x118b3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With the rise of geolocation systems on mobile devices (think &ldquo;around
me&rdquo; on the Apple iPhone), a consistent method of measuring points on 
Earth has become quite important. The standard that's used is latitude
and longitude, which measure the distance north or south of the equator and
the distance east or west of the prime meridian (which goes through
Greenwich, England). Your GPS devices all understand this notation, as
does Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, MapQuest and so on.
</p><p>
From a shell scripting perspective, we're interested in both being able
to identify lat/lon for a point on the Earth and then, armed with that
information, to see if we can calculate the distance between two points on
the planet.
</p><p>
The first seems almost insurmountably hard until you learn that Yahoo Maps
has a very simple API that lets you specify a URL that includes a street
address and returns an XML object that includes its lat/lon values.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1093580.0x118b670"></a>
Where Is This Place?</h2></div></div><p>
For example, you might be familiar with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Washington, DC. I know you've seen pictures of the place. What's
its lat/lon?


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ u='http://api.maps.yahoo.com/ajax/geocode'
$ a='?appid=onestep&amp;qt=1&amp;id=m&amp;qs=1600+pennsylvania+ave+washington+dc'
$ curl "$u$a"
YGeoCode.getMap({"GeoID"      : "m",
                 "GeoAddress" : "1600 pennsylvania ave washington dc",
                 "GeoPoint"   : {"Lat" : 38.89859,
                                 "Lon" : -77.035971},
                 "GeoMID"     : false,
                 "success"    : 1} ,1);
&lt;!-- xm6.maps.re3.yahoo.com uncompressed/chunked
     Tue Aug  4 12:16:51 PDT 2009 --&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the output actually comes back as two lines; the
the data above, and in the other examples, has been reformatted to make
it more readable.
</p><p>
Skim that return object, and you'll see Latitude = 38.89859 and
Longitude = -77.035971. Feed those two into Google Maps as
&ldquo;38.89859,-77.035971&rdquo; as a check, and you'll find the image
shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10589f1.large.jpg"><img src="10589f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The White House
</p></div></div><p>
You guessed it, it's the street address of the White House.
</p><p>
Let's start by creating a simple script where you can
specify a street address and it will output lat/lon values.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1093580.0x118bbf0"></a>
Scripting Our Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The first part is easy: take whatever was specified on the command line, and
&ldquo;recode&rdquo; it to be URL-friendly. Then, append that to the Yahoo API
URL, and output the results of a curl call:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

url='http://api.maps.yahoo.com/ajax/geocode'
args='?appid=onestep&amp;qt=1&amp;id=m&amp;qs='
converter="$url$args"

addr="$(echo $* | sed 's/ /+/g')"
curl -s "$converter$addr"
exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
Let's test it with a different address this time:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ sh whereis.sh 2001 Blake Street, Denver, CO
YGeoCode.getMap({"GeoID"      : "m",
                 "GeoAddress" : "2001 Blake Street, Denver, CO",
                 "GeoPoint"   : {"Lat" : 39.754386,
                                 "Lon" : -104.994261},
                 "GeoMID"     : false,
                 "success"    : 1}, 1);
&lt;!-- x1.maps.sp1.yahoo.com uncompressed/chunked
     Tue Aug  4 12:37:44 PDT 2009 --&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can figure out what's at this address if you like.
More important, you can see that this
simple four-line script does the job&mdash;sort of.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1093580.0x118bf08"></a>
Cleaning Up the Output</h2></div></div><p>
What we really want, however, is to extract just the lat and lon values
and toss everything else out. This can be done with a bunch of different
tools, of course, including Perl and awk, but I'm a rebel, so I
use cut instead.
</p><p>
To do this, we need to count the double quotes (") in the output block.
The 12th double quote is immediately before the latitude value, and the 15th is
immediately after the longitude value. If we just worked with that, we would get:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh whereis.sh 2001 Blake Street, Denver, CO | cut -d\" -f13-15
:39.754386,"Lon":-104.994261},
</pre>
</p><p>
Okay, so that's most of the work. Better, though, is to specify two
different specific fields (13,15 rather than 13-15):


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh whereis.sh 2001 Blake Street, Denver, CO | cut -d\" -f13,15
:39.754386,":-104.994261},
</pre>
</p><p>
That's 99% of what we want. Now we just need to clean up the noise. To do
that,
I'll jump back into the script itself, rather than experimenting on the
command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -s "$converter$addr" | \
    cut -d\" -f13,15 | \
    sed 's/[^0-9\.\,\-]//g'
</pre>
</p><p>
And testing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh whereis.sh 2001 Blake Street, Denver, CO
39.754386,104.994261,
</pre>
</p><p>
Almost. Really, really close. But, that last comma is not wanted. Hmmm....
</p><p>
Okay! To delete the last comma, we simply need to add a second substitution
to the sed statement, so that the full sed expression is now:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/[^0-9\.\,\-]//g;s/,$//'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1093580.0x118c488"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(The invocation is substitute/old-pattern/new-pattern/.)
</p><p>
Now we've got what we set out to create initially. Let's try it
with yet another address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh whereis.sh 1313 S. Disneyland Drive, Anaheim CA
33.814413,-117.924424
</pre>
</p><p>
Yep, that's the parking structure for Disneyland in California.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1093580.0x118c698"></a>
Distance between Two Points</h2></div></div><p>
Now comes the hard part of this, actually. We can get the lat/lon of any
address we desire, but calculating the distance between two points is a bit
more tricky, as the mathematics involved is rather hairy, because what
we're basically going to do is measure relative to the circumference of
Earth.
</p><p>
I found a formula in JavaScript on-line as a starting point:


<pre     class="programlisting">
var R    = 6371;        // kilometers
var dLat = (lat2-lat1);
var dLon = (lon2-lon1);
var a    = Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
           Math.cos(lat1.toRad()) * Math.cos(lat2.toRad()) *
           Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);
var c    = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
var d    = R * c;
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, the circumference is R, and it's 6,371km. Because
Earth is an oblate spheroid, not a perfect sphere, I expect this will
have some small level of error, but let's proceed and see where we
get.
</p><p>
To accomplish any sophisticated mathematics in a Linux shell, we're
pretty much stuck with bc, but it's plenty powerful enough
for this task, even if it's a bit clunky.
</p><p>
As an example, here's how you'd set the value of pi
within a bc script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pi=$(echo "scale=10; 4*a(1)" | bc -l)
</pre>
</p><p>
The first stumble we have is that bc wants to work with radians, not
degrees, but the lat/lon values we're getting are in degrees, so we
need to convert them.
</p><p>
But before we do that, here's the intermediate output we seek, as we
now need to work with two addresses, not just one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh farapart.sh \
  "1600 pennsylvania ave, washington dc" \
  "1313 s. disneyland drive, anaheim, ca"

Lat/long for 1600 pennsylvania ave, washington dc

= 38.89859, -77.035971

Lat/long for 1313 s. disneyland drive, anaheim, ca

= 33.814413, -117.924424
</pre>
</p><p>
Next month, we'll crack open the script to see how I am working with two
addresses at the same time and splitting it into the four variables
we'll later need. Then, we'll look at how to use bc to do the math.
