Your shoulder will thank you for traveling with TRENDnet's TEW-654TR
Wireless N Travel Router Kit, a device that its maker calls the world's
smallest 300Mbps wireless 802.11n router. This little guy measures a
mere 6.4 x 8.2 x 1.9cm and comes with a carrying case, a thin 1-meter
Ethernet cable, an Energy Star Certified external power adapter and
an alternate USB cable to power the router from a computer. The router
also features Access Point and Access Point Client modes and offers the
latest in wireless encryption to protect valuable data. An advanced
Multiple Input Multiple Output antenna technology delivers high-speed
wireless connectivity and broad coverage that minimizes dead spots.

Colfax International's HPC Cluster Computing Bundles</h2></div></div><p>
In an effort to expand the accessibility of HPC, Colfax International
announced availability of two new low-cost HPC cluster computing bundles,
which include InfiniBand switches and adapters provided by Mellanox
Technologies and Platform Computing's Platform Cluster Manager. The new
bundles improve application performance and productivity in enterprise and
data centers by adding 20Gb/s (Bundle 1) or 40Gb/s (Bundle 2) InfiniBand
connectivity and simplify cluster operation through a fully integrated
software stack. They further enable more companies to take advantage of
the performance, low-latency and efficiency benefits of InfiniBand and
the ease of use provided by Platform Cluster Manager, the latter of which
&ldquo;allows a user to build a cluster in hours versus weeks&rdquo;, says Colfax.
A 10Gb/s bundle also is available.

iX Systems' iX-Green Neutron Server Line </h2></div></div><p>
Go green and save green with
iX Systems' new iX-Green Neutron, a server line that its maker says
&ldquo;is optimized for high-performance applications and provides the
lowest power consumption on the market&rdquo;. The iX-Green Neutron models
iX-GN1204, iX-GN1208 and iX-GN 2216 utilize power-saving DDR3 memory,
2.5" SAS and/or SATA drives and are equipped with high-efficiency
(86%&ndash;93%) power supplies, all designed to reduce data-center costs
without sacrificing performance. The series also leverages Intel's Xeon
Processor 5500 series to boost performance, speed and energy efficiency
over previous generation processors (12% at peak performance and 47%
when idle), in part due to the way it interacts with power-saving DDR3
memory. The 5520 chipset introduces Intel QuickPath technology, which
allows high-speed point-to-point links to navigate shared memory swiftly,
distributed amongst the processors, greatly increasing efficiency and
thereby cutting back on memory power utilization as well. The systems
run FreeBSD.

Peter Seibel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Coders at Work</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Learn how some of the world's most interesting computer programmers
&ldquo;tick&rdquo;
with Peter Seibel's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Coders at Work</em></span> from Apress. Editor Seibel

the day-to-day work of programming while revealing how they became
great programmers, how they recognize programming talent in others
and what kinds of problems they find most interesting. Some of the
interviewees include Frances Allen, the first female winner of the
Turing Award and IBM fellow; L. Peter Deutsch, author of Ghostscript;
Brendan Eich, inventor of JavaScript; Simon Peyton Jones, co-inventor of
Haskell; Donald Knuth, creator of TeX; and Ken Thompson, inventor of UNIX.
The book is for programmers interested in new approaches and points of
view that can be gleaned from leaders in the field.

Fixstars' Y-HPC</h2></div></div><p>
The new, updated v2.1 of Fixstars' Y-HPC for Sony PlayStation 3, dubbed by
the company as the world's only commercial, cross-architecture cluster
construction suite, is now available. This release's key improvement
is the addition of the next generation of ps3vram for fast, temporary
file storage or swap using PS3 video RAM. This version of ps3vram, says
Fixstars, is up to 50% faster than prior versions and is automatically
enabled as swap. Also included are the new features found in Yellow
Dog Enterprise Linux v6.1, such as updated kernel v2.6.28, IBM Cell SDK
v3.1.0.1, improved ps3vram support and Libfreevec. Fixstars says that
the monumental improvements in compute performance from Y-HPC v2.1 will
allow existing and new PlayStation 3 clusters to tackle problems never
before believed to be practical.
