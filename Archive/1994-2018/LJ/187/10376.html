&ldquo;DNS is down and nothing is working!&rdquo; is not something anyone ever wants
to hear at 3am. Virtually every service on a modern network depends
on DNS to function. When DNS goes down, you can't send mail, you can't
get to the Web, you can't do much&mdash;hopefully, your coffeemaker is not
Web-enabled! Administrators do a lot of things to mitigate this risk.
The traditional safeguard is to establish multiple DNS servers for a
given site. Each DNS client on the network is configured with each
of those servers' IP addresses. The chances of all of those servers
failing in a catastrophic way are fairly small, so you have a margin
of safety.
</p><p>
On the other hand, many stub resolvers will take only two DNS
servers, making it nearly impossible to have any meaningful geographical
dispersion in your DNS topology. DNS stub resolvers generally use the
first of two configured DNS servers exclusively. Consequently, you end up
with one server taking the entire query load and one idling, waiting for
a failure. Not optimal, but hey, that's the price of redundancy...right?
It doesn't have to be.
</p><p>
DNS redundancy and failover is a classic use case for anycast. Anycast is
the concept of taking one IP address and sharing it between multiple
servers, each unaware of the others. The DNS root nameservers make
extensive use of anycast. There are currently 16 root nameserver
IP addresses, only eight of which make use of anycast. There are
167 servers that respond to those 16 IP addresses.
</p><p>
Of course,
anycast is not limited to DNS. It can be used to provide redundancy
and failover for any number of stateless protocols and applications.
Anycast might sound a little like multicast, but aside from the one-to-many,
IP-to-endpoint relationship, they have very little in common. Multicast
takes packets from one sender and delivers them to multiple endpoints,
all of which subscribe to a single multicast address using a number of
multicast-specific routing technologies. Anycast takes packets from
one sender and delivers those packets to the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; of a number of
possible endpoints using nothing more than standard unicast routing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9e580.0x2b966c8"></a>
How Does It All Work?</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start with some terminology:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
An endpoint (also known as a node) is a server that responds to an
anycast address and, by extension, provides services on that address.
</p></li><li><p>
An anycast address is an IP address that has multiple endpoints
associated with it. Anycast addresses can be from any part of the normal
IPv4 address space.
</p></li><li><p>
A service address is a unique IP address on a physical device on the
system. Service addresses are used for administrative or monitoring
access to anycast endpoints.
</p></li><li><p>
IGP anycast refers to an anycast scheme confined to a single network
(typically a larger network with multiple physical sites). I
cover IGP anycast in this article.
</p></li><li><p>
BGP anycast refers to an anycast scheme that spans multiple networks
and can span the entire Internet. The DNS root servers use BGP anycast.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Anycast endpoints participate in whatever internal routing protocol is
being run on your network. All endpoints for a given anycast IP advertise
a host route (also known as a /32) for the anycast IP to the router.
In other words, each endpoint announces that the anycast IP can be
reached through it. Your routers will see the advertisements coming
from the various servers and determine the best path to that IP address.
Therein lies the magic. Because the IP address is advertised from multiple
locations, your router ends up choosing the best path to that IP address,
according to the metric in use by that routing protocol&mdash;meaning
either the path with the fewest hops (RIP), the highest bandwidth path
(OSPF) or some other measurement of network goodness. When you send a
request to an anycast IP address, it will be routed to the single server
with the best metric according to the routers between you and the server.
</p><p>
What if that server fails? If the host fails, it will stop sending out
routing advertisements. The routing protocol will notice and remove
that route. Traffic then will flow along the next best path. Now,
the fact that the host is up does not necessarily mean that the service is up.
For that, you need some sort of service monitoring in place and the
capability to remove a host from the anycast scheme on the fly.
</p><p>
Naturally, myriad other details need to be worked out when
designing an anycast scheme. The general concept is pretty simple, and
small implementations are easy to set up. However, no matter what size
implementation you're dealing with, proper IP address architecture is
a must. Your anycast address should be on its own subnet, separate
from any other existing subnets. The anycast subnet must never, ever,
be included in a summary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9e580.0x2b96cf8"></a>
Implementation Details</h2></div></div><p>
Many projects provide routing protocol d&aelig;mons
for Linux, any number of which would be usable for this scenario.
For this article, I use Quagga, which is a fork of GNU Zebra.
Quagga is available both on the install media and from the standard
package repositories of pretty much every enterprise-oriented Linux
distribution.
</p><p>
For the following examples, I also use a
network populated with Cisco routers, running OSPF version 2, for IPv4.
Quagga also supports BGP, RIP, RIPng and OSPFv3. The remainder of this
article assumes at least a basic familiarity with OSPF theory and
configuration. (See Resources for links to basic primers.) Cisco also
publishes a ton of very good reference material (again, see Resources). I cover the
required configuration on the router side, but not in extensive detail.
</p><p>
Now, let's get down to the good stuff: setting up Quagga on Linux.
To begin, I describe how to install Quagga, set up a loopback alias to hold the anycast IP
address and configure Quagga to talk to your local routers. Then, I
go over a few optional configuration extras.
</p><p>
First, install Quagga. For example, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL),
run <tt  >yum install quagga</tt>. Substitute the appropriate package-management
command for your distribution, as needed.
</p><p>
Next, create a loopback interface alias on the system. Configure the
anycast IP address on this loopback interface. Using a loopback interface
alias instead of a physical interface alias allows you to do a number
of cool things. You could segment your service traffic from your
administrative traffic. You could add some redundancy by responding
to the anycast address on two physical interfaces, each attached to
a different router or switch (although I won't go into that kind of
configuration here). You also could take down the anycast interface (and,
therefore, remove that interface from the anycast scheme) without affecting
your ability to administer the system remotely. On RHEL, the interface
configuration files are located in /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/.
Create a file in that directory named ifcfg-lo:0 with the following
contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cat /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-lo:0
DEVICE=lo:0
IPADDR=10.0.0.1
NETMASK=255.255.255.255
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
That file's format is fairly self-explanatory. You can control the lo:0
interface with your normal interface control commands (ifup, ifdown,
ifconfig and so on).
</p><p>
Some versions of Fedora use NetworkManager to control
eth0 by default. This may cause strange things to happen when you
try to bring up a loopback alias. If that happens to you, add the line
<tt  >NM_CONTROLLED=no</tt> to
/etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, and
restart your network. At this point, you should be able to bring up your
new interface with <tt  >ifup lo:0</tt>.
</p><p>
Now, you need to configure Quagga. By default, the Quagga configuration
files are in /etc/quagga and /etc/sysconfig/quagga. There are a number of
example configuration files in /etc/quagga: one for each routing protocol
that Quagga supports; one for zebra, the main process; and one for the
vtysh configuration. We primarily are interested in the ospfd.config and
zebra.config files. The syntax in those files is similar to the standard
Cisco configuration syntax, but with important differences. Also note
that, by default, all routing processes bind to a d&aelig;mon-specific port
on 127.0.0.1. If you configure a password for that routing process
and Telnet to that port, you can monitor and configure the process on
the fly using the same Cisco-like syntax. In these files, ! is the
comment character:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cat zebra.conf
hostname Endpoint1
!
interface eth0
  ip address 10.0.1.2/24
!
interface lo:0
  ip address 10.0.0.1/32
</pre>
</p><p>
The above file is pretty quick and easy. It contains the IP addresses and
netmasks of the physical adapters and the loopback adapter that has the
anycast address. This file is much more complex:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cat ospfd.conf
hostname Endpoint1
!
interface eth0
  ip ospf authentication message-digest
  ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 foobar
  ip ospf priority 0
!
router ospf
  log-adjacency-changes
  ospf router-id 10.0.1.2
  area 10.0.1.2 authentication message-digest
  area 10.0.1.2 nssa
  network 10.0.1.0/24 area 10.0.1.2
  redistribute connected metric-type 1
  distribute-list ANYCAST out connected
!
access-list ANYCAST permit 10.0.0.1/32
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's go over the above section by section,
starting with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
interface eth0
  ip ospf authentication message-digest
  ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 foobar
</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing in the file is the OSPF MD5 authentication configuration.
Always configure MD5 authentication on your OSPF sessions. Replace
<tt  >foobar</tt> with the appropriate key for your environment.
</p><p>Next, we have:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ip ospf priority 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Also set the OSPF priority to 0, which prevents the server from being
elected as the Designated Router on that link.
</p><p>
Next come the router configuration directives:

<pre     class="programlisting">
router ospf
  log-adjacency-changes
</pre>
</p><p>
log-adjacency-changes is a great configuration directive that gives you
more details when there is a change in neighbor relationships between
your server and any other OSPF-speaking device.
</p><p>Then:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ospf router-id 10.0.1.2
</pre>
</p><p>
Here the router ID is set to the server's service address. Router IDs must
be unique within the routing domain.
</p><p>We then configure this server to be in its own Not So Stubby Area
(NSSA):

<pre     class="programlisting">
area 10.0.1.2 authentication message-digest
area 10.0.1.2 nssa
redistribute connected metric-type 1
distribute-list 5 out connected
</pre>
</p><p>
NSSA areas are a form of stub area that limits the routes sent
into the area to summary routes, but still allows external routes to come
from that area. We need to allow external routes because we advertise our
anycast IP address by redistributing our connected interfaces and running
that through a distribute list to confine our advertised interfaces to
just the anycast IP address. However, we don't want this server to have
to deal with all the routes in area 0.0.0.0.
</p><p>The following statement selects the interfaces that will participate in
OSPF:

<pre     class="programlisting">
network 10.0.1.0/24 area 10.0.1.2
</pre>
</p><p>
We want our eth0 interface to participate in OSPF, so we specify
10.0.1.0/24, and we put those interfaces in area 10.0.1.1.
</p><p>The following line defines the access list that will allow route
advertisements out:

<pre     class="programlisting">
access-list ANYCAST permit 10.0.0.1/32
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that Quagga is configured, we need to open up the proper IP protocol
number on our firewall. OSPF uses protocol number 89. The details of
opening that particular protocol number will vary significantly
with the firewall configuration you're using.
</p><p>
In general, you'll use a command like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# iptables -I INPUT -p 89 -j ALLOW
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9e580.0x2b97b68"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which inserts the rule permitting IP protocol 89 at the start of the
INPUT chain. That command will work with most any standard firewall
configuration. After all of this, you finally can get Quagga going.
Start it with <tt  >service zebra start</tt> and
<tt  >service ospfd start</tt>.
Your system now should be participating in your OSPF routing scheme.
</p><p>
You can confirm that with a quick look at your router's routing table:


<pre     class="programlisting">
R1&gt;show ip route 10.0.0.1
Routing entry for 10.0.0.1/32
  Known via "ospf 1", distance 110, metric 21, type NSSA extern 1
  Last update from 10.0.1.2 on FastEthernet0/0, 00:00:14 ago
  Routing Descriptor Blocks:
  * 10.0.1.2, from 10.0.1.2, 00:00:14 ago, via FastEthernet0/0
      Route metric is 21, traffic share count is 1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9e580.0x2f90078"></a>
Optional Quagga Configuration Extras</h2></div></div><p>
To enable remote administration, you must set a password in ospfd.conf
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
password YOUR-PASSWORD
enable password YOUR-ENABLE-PASSWORD
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are feeling paranoid about your server establishing neighbor
relationships with devices other than your router, you can disable OSPF
automatic neighbor discovery on your server with the following additional
commands in ospfd.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
interface eth0
  ip ospf network non-broadcast

router ospf
  neighbor ROUTER-ID-OF-ROUTER
</pre>
</p><p>
This configuration has each endpoint in its own OSPF NSSA area.
You just as easily could have the endpoints become part of whatever area
is already in existence, as long as that area allows external routes.
Having each server in its own area gives you a little more control over
what kind of routes propagate to and from each endpoint. It is a bit more
work, both initially and when you move a server to a different router.
It also means your servers have to be able to connect directly to an ABR
with access to area 0, which may or may not be possible in your network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9e580.0x2f902e0"></a>
Sample Anycast Layout</h2></div></div><p>
Anycast with one endpoint is fairly useless, so let's take a look at a
simple deployment scenario. Each endpoint is configured exactly like the
endpoint we just configured, with the exception of the service address
and the OSPF area number.
</p><p>
In this scenario, let's say we have anycast running between two sites (for instance,
a main office and a satellite office) connected over a WAN. There is
one anycast endpoint at each site. The main office is 10.0.1.0/24,
the satellite office is 10.0.2.0/24, and our anycast address is 10.0.0.1,
from our anycast subnet, 10.0.0.0/25 (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10376f1.large.jpg"><img src="10376f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Two-Site, Two-Server Environment
</p></div></div><p>
OSPF on R1 is configured as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
router ospf 1
 log-adjacency-changes
 network 10.0.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 10.0.1.2
 network 10.0.0.128 0.0.0.128 area 0.0.0.0
 area 10.0.1.2 nssa no-summary default-information-originate
 area 10.0.1.2 authentication message-digest
 area 0.0.0.0 authentication message-digest
</pre>
</p><p>
OSPF on R2 is configured as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
router ospf 1
 log-adjacency-changes
 network 10.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 area 10.0.2.2
 network 10.0.0.128 0.0.0.128 area 0.0.0.0

      Route metric is 21, traffic share count is

R2&gt;show ip route 10.0.0.1

      Route metric is 21, traffic share count is 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Traffic from each of the sites is flowing to the local anycast endpoint.
Here's what happens if we take out the main office endpoint:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Endpoint1# ifdown lo:0
Endpoint1#

R1&gt;show ip route 10.0.0.1
Routing entry for 10.0.0.1/32

      Route metric is 85, traffic share count is 1

R2&gt;show ip route 10.0.0.1

      Route metric is 21, traffic share count is 1
</pre>
</p><p>
All traffic starts to flow to the remaining endpoint, as designed and desired.

Monitoring and Automatic Route Withdrawal</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned previously, the fact that a host is up does not mean that
the service that host provides is up. When a host running Quagga goes
down, any routes that host inserted into OSPF will be withdrawn. We need
to do the same thing when a service does down. Any piece of monitoring
software that can run a handler script in response to a monitoring
event can be used for this task. The basic idea is to execute a test
against the anycast IP from each anycast endpoint. If a test fails, you
need to run <tt  >ifdown lo:0</tt> on the failed endpoint. Quagga will detect
the downed interface and withdraw the route to that interface from OSPF.
Administrators then can fix the box at their leisure and place the box
back into service with a simple <tt  >ifup lo</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a9e580.0x2f90b20"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Application/Router Configuration Notes</b></p><p>
1. Adjusting the cost of a link can be a great way to prepare
an endpoint for removal gracefully. Using any other method, especially in a
high-traffic environment, can result in dropped connections and other
transient issues until OSPF reconverges. Setting the link cost very
high before removal, on the other hand, avoids any transient problems
during the brief reconvergence period. Once the endpoint in question
is no longer receiving traffic, you can disable the anycast loopback
and do whatever work needs to be done. Adjust the cost of a link on
the router connected to your server with the following commands (in the
example above that would be R1 or R2):


<pre     class="programlisting">
interface WHATEVER-INTERFACE-CONNECTS-THE-ROUTER-TO-QUAGGA
  ip ospf cost NUMBER
</pre>
</p><p>
Replace {number} with some large number that is greater than
the cost of the replacement anycast endpoint.
</p><p>
2. Make sure nonresponse traffic is not sourced from the anycast address.
One example is in configuring DNS. You want DNS replies to come from the
anycast IP address, but you do not want DNS zone transfers to come from
or go to anycast IP addresses. In the case of a caching nameserver,
you also don't want recursive queries originated from the server to be
sourced from the anycast address.
</p><p>
3. Applications that maintain state in some way are not good candidates
for anycast addressing, even if the underlying transport protocol
is stateless. The exception to that rule would be if all the anycast
endpoints got their application-level state information from the same
place.
</p><p>
4. UDP is the de facto standard for the anycast transport-layer protocol.
Use any other transport-layer protocol at your own risk. See Resources for
a detailed review of issues associated with using other transport-layer
protocols.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Anycast is a great technique to enhance the reliability and
fault tolerance of applications and services on your network.
When designing your anycast topology, keep several rules and
guidelines in mind. I've shown a very basic use case and deployment
of anycast here. You can take the same concepts covered in this article, along
with a fair bit of networking knowledge, and scale them to a worldwide
deployment. If you do it right, you can have redundancy without nearly
as many idle machines sitting around.
