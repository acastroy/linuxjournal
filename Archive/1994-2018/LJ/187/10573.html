<span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span>&mdash;Quality <span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas Hold'em</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.pokerth.net" target="_self">www.pokerth.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
During this decade, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas Hold'em</em></span> rapidly has become one of the most
popular variants of poker across the globe. Taking center stage in such
films as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casino Royale</em></span> and being the main feature in the World Series
of Poker, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas Hold'em</em></span> is now the coolest game around. However, unless
you want to use some kind of tacky on-line game, it's hard to find a sim
that feels any good. Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> steps up to the plate quite nicely
indeed. According to its Web site:
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> is a poker game written in C++/Qt4. You can play the popular
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas Hold'em</em></span> poker variant against up to nine computer opponents or
play network games with people all over the world. This poker engine is
available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS.&rdquo;
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> downloads page has a number of binary
packages, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span>
also is included in a number of repositories. A distro-neutral binary package 
also is available as a tarball, along with a binary installer and source.
</p><p>
For those going with source, grab the latest tarball, extract it and
open a terminal in the new folder. Chances are, you won't have all
the needed libraries, so install the following as recommended by the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> Web site:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Qt version &gt;= 4.4.3, 4.5.1 recommended.
</p></li><li><p>
zlib version 1.2.3. 
</p></li><li><p>
libcurl version &gt;= 7.16.
</p></li><li><p>
gnutls (version 2.2.2).
</p></li><li><p>
libboost_thread, libboost_filesystem, libboost_datetime,
libboost_program_options, libboost_iostreams, libboost_asio and libboost_regex
(version &gt;= 1.36, 1.38.0 recommended).
</p></li><li><p>
libSDL_mixer and libSDL.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I also had to install libqt4-dev. Once you have all the needed
dependencies, enter the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ qmake-qt4 pokerth.pro
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
When the installation is over, run <span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pokerth
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're lucky, it will be in your system's menu, and there also may be
a new desktop icon.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The starting screen will have the options to start a local game,
an Internet game, create a network game or join a network game. Obviously,
you'll want to learn the game's interface before playing
anyone else, so choose Start Local Game. A screen appears with a
default number of players, starting cash, blind settings and game
speed. Unless you really know what you're doing, stick with the given
defaults.
</p><p>
I'm assuming you know the basics of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas Hold'em</em></span> here, but even if you
don't, the game goes to some lengths to make the learning process
fairly intuitive. As soon as you're in the actual game screen, you'll be
right in the action with two cards dealt. Here you can bet for more
cash on the table, check/call or fold. As soon as you make your choice,
things move on to the next player and the round continues.
</p><p>
As the game moves on, more bets can be placed before everyone has
called/checked, more cards are revealed, and the round finishes with
someone winning the pot. Above the Raise, Call and Fold buttons is
also the option to go all-in. The field with the numbers next to the All-In
button
with the slider below lets you adjust how much you want to bet/raise,
rather than being stuck with the game's defaults.
</p><p>
A helpful feature for new players is that it actually displays what hands
you should play for on the left, along with the terminology. On the right are
some tabs with brilliant features.
</p><p>
The first tab contains a log of all that's happened so far. The second
tab has what actions to choose when you're away from the computer. And
best of all, the last tab has a dynamically updated chance section,
telling the mathematical chance you have of getting each kind
of hand.
</p><p>
This last feature is particularly of use for new players, because it
tells what chance you have of getting the hand you're after, so you
don't need to be a mathematical savant. This is great for getting a feel
for the game and avoiding stupid errors. Once you've played
for a while, the dynamics and mathematics of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas
Hold'em</em></span> should start
to come more intuitively.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10573f1.large.jpg"><img src="10573f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Note the helpful guide of possible hands for new players on the left and a
chance meter on the right.
</p></div></div><p>
Playing the computer becomes tedious after a while (the computer
is all math and no instinct), and you'll be wanting to play some
humans soon. Close the game, go back to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> main screen, and choose
Internet Game. You'll be taken to a screen with lots of games from which to 
choose. Pick an open game that has a decent number of players, and
when the host is ready to start, the game will proceed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10573f2.large.jpg"><img src="10573f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Playing on-line, you get a time limit and a chat window. Note the four
color suits&mdash;great for avoiding mixups in quick situations like this.
</p></div></div><p>
The first major difference you'll notice between on-line play and local play
is that a timer bar is applied in on-line mode, which takes care of tardy
players. If you are going to be away from the computer for any amount
of time, it's worth changing your settings in the Away tab on your
right. An on-line chat tab also is available&mdash;great for a social
game like poker. When you're ready to leave, press the Lobby button on the
bottom-right corner. I'll let you work out the rest of the game from here.
</p><p>
It's definitely worth having a look at the game's Web site,
where users have made a number of themes and additions. I find the
default theme a little bland, but some other themes are
quite snazzy. Some card themes have four different colors as well,
which really helps you differentiate between suits quickly when it's
midnight and you have a head full of whiskey!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10573f3.large.jpg"><img src="10573f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Some of the themes, such as Stardust (shown here), look snazzy and
make <span  class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span> a real class act.
</p></div></div><p>
I'm sure <span   class="emphasis"><em>Texas Hold'em</em></span> fans will love
<span   class="emphasis"><em>PokerTH</em></span>.
Its use of open protocols, such as IRC, should help its
longevity, and its large fan base is testament to this (I've never once
had trouble finding a game on-line). It's a great poker sim for newbies
and veterans alike, and I highly recommend it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27cc580.0x28c5bc0"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Moto</em></span>&mdash;Motorbike 2-D Platformer
(<a href="http://xmoto.sourceforge.net" target="_self">xmoto.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Something that's been making a buzz at SourceForge,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Moto</em></span> appears to be
a remake of an old DOS game I used to play, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Action
Supercross</em></span>, along
with its earlier Windows remake, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Elastomania</em></span>. Some tweaks have been
made to the the physics engine, new community levels have been added, and
it's now about ten times harder! This game is a physics engine gone mad,
allowing for some truly hilarious moves and addictive gameplay. The actual
premise of the game and its controls are simple, yet the dynamics
and gameplay are complex. The result is that despite its simplistic
look, this actually is one of the hardest games I've ever played.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you look on the Web site, lots of installation methods are
available, and installing <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Moto</em></span> is easy. Packages are provided for various
distros in deb, rpm and Slackware form, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Moto</em></span> is provided in a
number of repositories, so it's well worth having a look in your package
manager first. And, for those who like to do things the hard(er) way,
a source tarball also is provided.
</p><p>
In terms of requirements, you'll need: aclocal, SDL_mixer, liblua,
libode0, build-essential, sqlite3, zlib, libjpeg, libpng, libbz2, glu,
SDL_ttf, liblualib50 and libcurl. For the source, download the latest
tarball, extract it, open a terminal in the new folder and enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
To run the game, look in your system's game menu, or enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xmoto
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
When the game first starts, it prompts you to connect to the
Net. I recommend saying yes, because there's a whole swag of things you can do
when connected, such as rate levels, get new ones and so on. If you
don't like being connected, you can turn it off with F8 anyway. Let's
get playing. Click Levels, and in the menu below in the Level Packs tab,
look under All Levels and choose a level. I recommend working
your way through the &ldquo;aeRo's Training&rdquo; levels first and going
onto 
harder levels from there.
</p><p>
Once you're in the game itself, the bike is controlled purely with
the arrow keys and the spacebar&mdash;that's it. The up key controls the
bike's throttle, and the down key controls the brakes. The right key
rotates/pitches the bike clockwise, and the left key, anti-clockwise. The
spacebar flips the direction of the bike between left and right, and
this can be performed anywhere, at any time. When you need to restart
the level, press Enter (you'll be doing this a lot). You'll probably notice
that each level has a timer, and each level has a high score Internet-wide.
If you're an <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Moto</em></span> fanatic, I'm sure you'll wanna take someone down!
</p><p>
Although this game may look simple at first glance, beginners will have
trouble just keeping the bike upright. Full throttle starts generally
result in a wheelie, and if you don't &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the physics engine and its
inertia, you'll quickly flip the bike over and land on your head. The
main things to grasp are what the active objects are in this game,
how everything is controlled and what this will allow you to do.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10573f4.large.jpg"><img src="10573f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The wacky physics engine allows you to do some truly mind-boggling stunts!
</p></div></div><p>
First, there's the rider's head. Don't hit it on anything, or the level
ends, and you have to restart. However, things also can go through the
rider's body. Now this might sound strange, but it allows for some truly
hilarious possibilities, such as hanging upside down on a rail with the
wheels on top. The suspension reacts in real time and is a big part of
the physics engine. The tires will react in time with the suspension also,
so pay constant attention to your terrain. Remember that like most motorbikes, this is rear-wheel drive only, so if you try to feed on power when
you're only on the front wheel, it won't do any good. Braking, however,
works on both wheels.
</p><p>
Braking is very important in some often unexpected ways, because many
puzzles require you to lock your wheels and actually flip the bike
over. Don't forget that the body of the rider itself also will flip
forward under braking inertia, not just the bike, so if you pull up
too hard and too late before a wall, the rider might hit his head, even
though the bike is still okay.
</p><p>
Learning to feel the actual game is really important&mdash;get to grips
with the physics engine, especially on tricky hills where the bike can
tip over and you lose all of your momentum&mdash;you want your reactions to
come naturally. Learn to use opposing power, flipping the bike around
and applying power in the reverse direction, as braking isn't always
the answer. Don't glue down the accelerator. Some puzzles require
quick dabs on the keyboard, and just about every level requires a lot
of delicacy. Finally, remember that when the bike is riding
upside down hanging on a ledge (yes, it's crazy, but it's what the game
is all about), the wheel will be turning in the opposite direction
to when the bike is upright. This is counter-intuitive at first,
but you'll get used to it.
</p><p>
I've covered only basic single-player stuff here, but this game
has many more features and some very clever adaptations, especially in
the scripted levels, which really show off what this crazy engine can
do. If you check the Web site, you'll notice it has a very extensive
community and, most important, a level
editor. Try making your own levels, and explore the dynamics of
this game intimately.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10573f5.large.jpg"><img src="10573f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
In-game scripting allows people to make their own modifications freely,
sometimes with elaborate results as shown here.

Look on-line and you'll find some truly crazy levels!
