Have you ever wondered why your multimedia
streams stop working after you switch to a
different network with your laptop?
Have you thought about why setting up a server on your home
network behind a NAT is so awkward or even impossible?
Host Identity Protocol for Linux (HIPL)
offers a remedy to these and other problems.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f84710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
An IP address determines the name and network
location of a computer on the Internet. The
network
stack reuses this IP address at all layers,
including the application layer. As a
consequence, existing network connections break
when an IP address changes. For example, suppose
you are streaming a video from your favorite
Web site and you switch from a WLAN to LAN
connection. Then, your host's IP address changes
and breaks the stream. This happens because
the video-streaming application and the host use
different IP addresses. Even though the host
uses the new IP address, the application still
uses the old address.
</p><p>
What creates this problem in the current
Internet architecture? The IP address specifies
both the name and the topological location of a
host on the Internet. Here's an analogy: a person
named Abhinav Pathak who lives in New Delhi
should still be called Abhinav Pathak when he is
visiting London. As simple as it may seem, this
analogy currently does not work on today's
Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f84978"></a>
How HIP Solves the Problem</h2></div></div><p>
Host Identity Protocol (HIP) assigns a
permanent, location-independent name to a host.
HIP names a host essentially using a public key,
which is referred to as Host Identity in HIP
literature. As public keys are quite long,
usually it is more convenient to use a 128-bit
fingerprint of the HI, which is called the Host
Identity Tag (HIT). The HIT resembles an IPv6
address, and it gives the host a permanent name.
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
allocated an IPv6 address prefix for HITs
(2001:0010::/28).
</p><p>
The HIT is similar to an SSH fingerprint, but
unlike SSH, it can be used by all applications.
HIP also supports IPv4-compatible names called
Local Scope Identifiers (LSIs). HITs in HIP are
statistically unique and inherently secure
because they are derived from public keys and,
therefore, are difficult to forge.
</p><p>
In HIP, sockets in transport protocols,
such as TCP, are bound to HITs rather than IP
addresses. The networking stack translates the HITs
to IP addresses before packet transmission on
the wire. The reverse occurs on the host receiving
HIP packets. When the host changes the network,
the networking stack changes the IP address for
the translation. The application doesn't notice
the change because it is using the constant HIT.
This is how HIP solves the problem of host
mobility.
</p><p>
HIIT has developed an implementation of
HIP for Linux (HIPL), which is available from
the InfraHIP II Web pages. In this article, we
describe how you can benefit from HIP and
explain how to install and run HIP on your Linux
system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f84b88"></a>
HIP Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Linux is ported to many platforms
and devices, such as laptops, smartphones and
PDAs. These devices are mobile but usually lack
mobility support from the networking stack.
Many networking applications on Linux
don't provide communications privacy either. HIP
solves both of these problems and also provides
support for multihomed hosts. Here, we describe four
practical problems that HIP solves.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f84c90"></a>
1. Access Control</h2></div></div><p>
Access to host services usually
is constrained using IP addresses. For example,
consider the access control files for Linux. The
hosts.allow and hosts.deny files contain the service
names and hostnames (or IP addresses) of the
hosts that are allowed to access certain
services.
</p><p>
Suppose a server grants permission to a
particular client to access its remote services,
such as SSH, FTP and so on. It specifies its
hosts files as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /etc/hosts.deny
ALL: ALL

$ cat /etc/hosts.allow
ALL: 10.0.0.10
</pre>
</p><p>
This states that only a client with an IP
address
of 10.0.0.10 is allowed to access services running
on this host. All other IPs are blocked.
</p><p>
Now, what happens when the client with IP
10.0.0.10 moves to a new network and its IP
address changes? Or, what happens if its DHCP
lease time expires and it is granted another IP
address? In such cases, the client would no
longer be able to access the server. Either it
has to regain its IP address or the server has
to update its hosts.allow and hosts.deny files.
</p><p>
HIP easily solves this problem.
The server's /etc/hosts.allow file contains the
HIT of the client instead of the IP address. The
client has the same HIT independent of its IP
address and, hence, its network location. The
entry in the /etc/hosts.allow file looks like
this with HIP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /etc/hosts.allow
ALL: [2001:15:e156:8a78:3226:dbaa:f2ff:ed06]
</pre>
</p><p>
This shows that the client with the HIT (that is, name)
2001:15:e156:8a78:3226:dbaa:f2ff:ed06 is allowed to access the
services on the server.
</p><p>
The HIP software running on the server
uses public keys to authenticate the client
before the client can use a particular service.
A crucial part of the authentication is for the
server to check that the client's HIT
(fingerprint) matches the public key. This way,
the server can cryptographically verify that the
client is the one it claims to be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f85058"></a>
2. Security&mdash;Authentication and Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
HIP authenticates and secures
communication between two hosts. HIP
authenticates hosts and establishes a symmetric
key between them to secure the data
communication. The data flow between the end
hosts is encrypted by IPsec Encapsulating
Security Payload (ESP) with the symmetric key
set up by HIP. HIP introduces mechanisms, such
as cryptographic puzzles, that protect HIP
responders (servers) against DoS attacks.
Applications simply need to use HITs instead of
IP addresses. Application source code does not
need to be modified.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f851b8"></a>
3. Mobility</h2></div></div><p>
HIP provides transparent mobility support
for existing network applications. TCP
connections are bound to HITs instead of IP
addresses. HITs do not change for a given host.
HITs are further mapped to IP addresses. When an
IP address changes, new mappings between the HIT
and the new IP address are formed. When a host
moves to a new network and obtains a new IP
address, the host informs its peers about its
new IP address, and TCP connections are
sustained.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f852c0"></a>
4. NAT Traversal</h2></div></div><p>
WLAN access points and broadband modems
employ NATs due to the lack of IPv4
addresses. However, you have to configure your
NAT settings manually if you want to use P2P
software or connect to your computer behind
a NAT.
It may even be impossible if your ISP employs a
second NAT.
</p><p>
With HIP, hosts can address each other
with HITs across private address realms of NATs.
HIP makes use of two alternative NAT traversal
technologies, ICE and Teredo, to traverse the
NATs. Setting up a server behind a NAT using HIP
does not require manual configuration of the
NAT. The HIPL on-line manual
<a href="http://infrahip.hiit.fi/hipl/manual/ch21.html" target="_self">infrahip.hiit.fi/hipl/manual/ch21.html</a> describes the details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f85478"></a>
Name Lookup Support</h2></div></div><p>
The InfraHIP site offers free services for the
HIP community. For example, you can register
your HIT to the DNS or Distributed Hash Table
(DHT). The site also offers free HIP forwarding
services to assist in NAT traversal and locating
mobile nodes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f85580"></a>
How HIP Works</h2></div></div><p>
The Host Identity Protocol architecture
(Figure 1) defines a new namespace, the Host
Identity namespace, which decouples the name
and locator roles of IP addresses. With HIP, the
transport layer operates on host identities
instead of IP addresses as endpoint names. The
host identity layer is between the transport
layer and the network layer. The responsibility
of the new layer is to translate identities to
routable locators before a host transmits the
packet. The reverse applies to incoming packets.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9129f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Host Identity layer is located between
the transport and network layers.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f85840"></a>
Protocol Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The actual Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
is composed of a two round-trip, end-to-end
Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol, called
base exchange, mobility updates and some
additional messages. The networking stack
triggers the base exchange automatically when an
application tries to connect to an HIT.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9129f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. HIP Base Exchange
</p></div></div><p>
During a base exchange, a client
(initiator) and a server (responder)
authenticate each other with their public
keys and create symmetric encryption keys for
IPsec to encrypt the application's traffic. In
addition, the initiator must solve a
computational puzzle. The responder selects the
difficulty of the puzzle according to its load.
When the responder is busy or under DoS attack,
the responder can increase the puzzle difficulty level
to delay new connections.
</p><p>
We can describe this process as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

I --&gt; DNS: lookup R
I &lt;-- DNS: return R's address and HI/HIT

</pre>
</p><p>
The initiator application connects to an HIT:


<pre     class="programlisting">
I1   I --&gt; R (Hi, Here is my I1, let's talk with HIP)
R1   R --&gt; I (OK, Here is my R1, solve this HIP puzzle)
I2   I --&gt; R (Computing, here is my counter I2)
R2   R --&gt; I (OK. Let's finish base exchange with my R2)

I --&gt; R (ESP protected data)
R --&gt; I (ESP protected data)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f7c5a0"></a>
Mobility and Rendezvous</h2></div></div><p>
HIP provides a mechanism similar to base
exchange to handle IP address changes. When a
host detects a new IP address, it informs all
its peers of the address change. The hosts
adjust their IPsec security associations
accordingly, and the applications running on the
hosts continue sending data to each other as if
nothing happened.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9129f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. HIP Mobility Updates
</p></div></div><p>
When two hosts are connected to each other using
HIP and one of them moves, the mobile host tells
its current location to the other. If both
hosts move at the same time, they can lose
contact with each other. In this case, an HIP
rendezvous server assists the hosts. The
rendezvous server has a fixed IP address and,
therefore, it offers a stable contact point for
mobile hosts. The rendezvous server relays only
the first packet, and after the contact, the
hosts can communicate with each other directly.
HIP includes another similar
service, called HIP Relay, that forwards all HIP
packets to support NAT traversal.

How to Install and Use HIPL</h2></div></div><p>
The HIPL software bundle consists of the
following main components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
HIPD (HIP D&aelig;mon): HIP control, IPsec key and
mobility management software.
</p></li><li><p>
HIPFW (HIP firewall utility
d&aelig;mon): supports HIP packet filtering to
enable public key-based access control and LSI
implementation. It also provides userspace IPsec
support for legacy hosts running kernel versions
below 2.6.27.
</p></li><li><p>
DNS Proxy for HIP: translates
hostname queries to DNS to HITs to applications
when an HIT can be found.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f7cc28"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
You can install HIPL from the precompiled
binaries or source code.
</p><p>
To install HIPL on Ubuntu Jaunty,
add a new file, /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hipl.list, with the following contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://packages.infrahip.net/ubuntu jaunty main

$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install hipl-all
</pre>
</p><p>
For Fedora 9 and above, first
make sure that SELinux configuration is disabled in /etc/selinux/config, and reboot your machine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELINUX=disabled
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, add a new file /etc/yum.repos.d/hipl.repo:


<pre     class="programlisting">
[hipl]
name=HIPL
baseurl=http://packages.infrahip.net/fedora/base/$releasever/$basearch
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
yum install hipl-all
</pre>
</p><p>
For details on HIPL installation for other distributions, see <a href="http://infrahip.hiit.fi/index.php?index=download" target="_self">infrahip.hiit.fi/index.php?index=download</a>.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can compile the HIPL software bundle manually from the
sources. To do so, first download and extract the HIPL
software bundle from <a href="http://infrahip.hiit.fi/hipl/hipl.tar.gz" target="_self">infrahip.hiit.fi/hipl/hipl.tar.gz</a>.
Run <tt  >autogen.sh --help</tt> to
list the library and header dependencies. After you
have installed the missing dependencies, you can
compile the software by running the script
without any arguments. To complete the manual
installation, run <tt  >make
install</tt>.
</p><p>
The default installation encapsulates all
HIP and IPsec traffic over UDP to support client-side NAT traversal. At
minimum, you need to
allow UDP port number 50500 in both
directions for IPv4. The HIPL manual describes
this in more detail at <a href="http://infrahip.hiit.fi/hipl/manual/ch02.html" target="_self">infrahip.hiit.fi/hipl/manual/ch02.html</a>.
</p><p>
Once installation has been completed,
you should start the HIP d&aelig;mon as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo hipd
</pre>
</p><p> 
When you start the hipd the first time,
it generates its configuration files and
identities in the /etc/hip/ directory. Your identity is
visible as an IPv6 address on the dummy0 device. To
see your host's identity, run the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ifconfig dummy0
## OR
$ ip addr show dev dummy0
</pre>
</p><p>
Correspondingly, your IPv4-based &ldquo;alias&rdquo; for the
HIT is listed on the dummy0:1 interface.
</p><p>
To perform name lookups for other
hosts, you also have to start the HIP DNS proxy
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo hipdnsproxy
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f7d5c8"></a>
Testing HIP with Firefox</h2></div></div><p>
HIP can be used with many applications
and protocols, including FTP, SSH, VLC, LDAP,
sendmail, Pidgin and VNC. However, the easiest
way to validate your HIPL software
installation is to start Firefox and connect to
the Web server located at <a href="http://crossroads.infrahip.net" target="_self">crossroads.infrahip.net</a>. The
Web server is running HIP and displays whether
HIP was used for the connection. You
optionally can install a Firefox add-on (<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10551" target="_self">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10551</a>), if you prefer a client-side indicator for
HIP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e8c580.0x1f7d7d8"></a>Streaming Multimedia and
Testing Mobility with VLC</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's stream some video with VLC and
then try mobility. The example in this section
assumes you have two computers with HIPL
installations. We also assume that the computers
are running in the same LAN with DHCP services.
In this example, the two computers connect to
LAN using the eth0 device.</p><p>
First, display an HIT for the first host, and
start
VLC client on one computer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
client$ hipconf get hi default     # HIT_OF_CLIENT
client$ vlc -vvv 'rtp://@[HIT_OF_CLIENT]:50004'
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, start the VLC server on the second host:

<pre     class="programlisting">
server$ vlc -vvv SOMEFILE.avi \
            --sout '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=[HIT_OF_CLIENT]}'
</pre>
</p><p>
The string <tt  >HIT_OF_CLIENT</tt> should not be taken literally. Instead,
you can discover it from the output of the hipconf command at the client.
The brackets around the HIT are mandatory for VLC to distinguish IPv4
addresses from IPv6.
</p><p>
Because the video stream is established
directly to an HIT, the connection is guaranteed
to use HIP; otherwise, the stream just fails.
In this case, we did not use a hostname, and
the server learns the client's IP address
by broadcasting the first HIP packet to the LAN.
The use of hostnames also is possible, and the
HIPL software bundle publishes your hostname on
InfraHIP's free name lookup servers by
default.
</p><p>
Finally, let's test mobility. Type the
following on the command line to obtain a new IP
address from your network:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dhclient eth0
</pre>
</p><p>
You may see a small glitch during the
dhclient run caused by a short disconnectivity
period from the network. If you also
have wireless connectivity, feel free to experiment with
handovers from the wired network to wireless and
vice versa.

The HIPL Community</h2></div></div><p>
HIPL is open-source software for Linux.
We are actively improving the software according
to feedback from user mailing lists (<a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/hipl-users" target="_self">www.freelists.org/list/hipl-users</a>). We welcome all Linux enthusiasts to the HIPL
community, and we are looking for more users and
developers.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Host Identity Protocol brings
communications privacy and mobility support for
existing applications by introducing a new
cryptographic namespace. It also allows you to set
up servers behind NATs easily. In this
article, we discussed how HIP works and how
you can install it on your Linux box. We have
shown how you can use HIP with Firefox and how
to stream video with VLC successfully during
network IP address change.
