If you're tired of functional but boring user interfaces, try
dressing up your desktop with funky panels and a 3-D window switcher.

Fran&ccedil;ois? You look a little green. What is wrong? Ah,
you were playing with the 3-D desktop switcher and got a little motion
sickness. Perhaps with your delicate condition, we should stick to the
more classic desktop pagers. Not at all, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, I am not making
fun of you. You are more of a down-to-earth kind of waiter, and things
zooming through space, toward you or away from you, are obviously not
for meant for one such as yourself. Get yourself together, Fran&ccedil;ois. We
certainly don't want you dropping the wine on our guests when you serve
it. Speaking of our guests, they have just arrived.
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span> to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, the world's
finest Linux French restaurant and the home
of the greatest wine cellar in the world. Please
sit and make yourselves comfortable. I'll have
my faithful waiter run down to the wine cellar
immediately. Steady, Fran&ccedil;ois. Let me see...the
2003 Casillero del Diablo Chilean Chardonnay would
be excellent with this menu&mdash;fresh pear and green
apple flavors and exactly the right acidity, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. Ordinarily, Fran&ccedil;ois,
I would tell you to hurry, but take it easy on the
way up!
</p><p>
Despite using a model we've come to think of as normal, many programmers
and users are looking for alternatives to the standard panel, pager
and system tray. What's interesting is that much of the hard work being
done on these panel replacements (or enhancements) involves some kind of
eye-popping, 3-D effects, the kind that has made Fran&ccedil;ois a bit unsteady
on his feet.
</p><p>
One of these alternative panels is Stephano's KXDocker Project, which
owes some inspiration to the Mac OS X Docker, but as Stephano explains
is &ldquo;more powerful&rdquo;. The effect created leaves your system with a
collection of icons representing various applications (including your
program launcher menus) running along the bottom. Running your mouse
across these icons in sequence creates an effect much like an icon
wave making its way along the bottom (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7889f1.large.jpg"><img src="7889f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This KDE panel does the wave with your icons.
</p></div></div><p>
The first step to getting KXDocker working is to pick up a copy
from the official project Web site (see the on-line Resources).
The Web site provides precompiled packages for an impressive number of the
major distributions. Source also is available if your system
isn't listed. A resources package
is available on the download page. This isn't necessary with the latest
builds, but it does
include some additional theme support so you may want to install it as
well (simply run the install.sh script). Building from source is
a fairly straightforward extract-and-build five step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf kxdocker-0.23.tar.bz2
cd kxdocker-0.23
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
I included a prefix to the standard
./configure step, because you'll want to install the
KXDocker program into the same hierarchy as your current KDE installation.
</p><p>
To use KXDocker, simply run <tt  >kxdocker</tt>. The dock
appears at the
bottom of your screen. It's probably a good idea to move the KDE Kicker
panel out of the way (drag it to the top for now). Although KXDocker is
designed as a replacement for the default KDE kicker, it works happily
in conjunction with it. In fact, KXDocker even disappears into your
system tray where it can be activated with a single click on its icon.
</p><p>
To change the default operation, included icons, themes and so on,
right-click on the panel and select Configurator (this also can be
done by right-clicking the system tray icon). The configurator is a
tabbed dialog from which you
can modify a number of items to make the dock work the way you want.
One setting you might want to change right away is listed in the Window
tab as Auto send to background, so that the dock isn't
obscured automatically by running application windows, such as a word processor. Once
a change has been made, click the Save icon and assign a name to this
configuration. When asked whether you want it loaded automatically when
you restart KXDocker, click Accept.
</p><p>
If the idea of improving your panel experience is starting to sound
interesting, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, don't stop there. Another project
well worth investigating is the KSmoothDock Team's
KSmoothDock. KSmoothDock works in two different zooming modes. The
default is called the normal zooming mode. As you move across
each icon in the new panel, the icons zoom to offer a larger
view (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7889f2.large.jpg"><img src="7889f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. KSmoothDock
in Normal Zoom Mode
</p></div></div><p>
This is only the beginning and the most basic of KSmoothDock's
settings. I discuss the others shortly, but to make KSmoothDock work, you need a copy. Although the official hosting
site for KSmoothDock is SourceForge, your best bet for the latest and
greatest on the project is the KDE-Look Web site (see Resources).
From there, you can get precompiled binaries for a few different releases.
Source also is available and can be installed on any system running
KDE 3.2 or later. The process, once again, is the classic extract-and-build five step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf ksmoothdock-3.5.1.tar.gz
cd ksmoothdock-3.5.1
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
Start the program by running <tt  >ksmoothdock</tt>. A window
appears suggesting that KDE's default Kicker panel should be moved to the top,
out of the way. The dialog offers to do it for you at this time. When
the ksmoothdock program is running, everything becomes iconified, except
the pager for the virtual desktops, including running tasks. The
icons are the default icons for the applications.
</p><p>
The second mode is called parabolic zooming mode and is more like the
effect created by KXDocker. In the normal mode, virtual desktops are
represented by numbered squares representing the workspaces, but they
do not zoom. This changes in the parabolic mode as shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7889f3.large.jpg"><img src="7889f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Mac OS X users will find this look familiar.
</p></div></div><p>
To switch to parabolic mode, right-click on the dock's program launcher
(far left) and select Switch to Parabolic Zooming Mode (Figure
4). Changing modes like this does, however, require that you then exit
the program and restart it for the changes to take effect. This is true
for switching back to normal mode if you find this one too dizzying.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7889f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Right-Click
to Switch Zooming Modes
</p></div></div><p>
The menu shown in Figure 4 has two other interesting items. The topmost item lets
you change the Quick Launch menu, which are the four default icons to the
right of the virtual desktops. Doing so opens a Konqueror window from
which you can create links to applications. The second is a Preferences
dialog. In the Preferences menu, you can select which components are
visible in the dock, such as the clock, and whether the taskbar icons are
to be included. Another interesting option is the level of opacity, which
lets you define how much of your wallpaper is visible through the dock.
</p><p>
In all of these cases, the one thing that stays more or less the same
is your pager and its virtual desktops&mdash;nothing really fancy there other
than some simple representative icon zooming. To address this, I'm going
to offer you a rather rich dessert and pull out all the stops on system
performance with some of the best eye candy I've seen in a long time. I'm
talking about Brad Wasson's 3D-Desktop, an OpenGL program that gives
you a slick way of switching from one virtual desktop to another. You
definitely need a 3-D accelerated video card for this one.
</p><p>
When the program starts, your screen shifts to 3-D mode. Your current
virtual desktop appears to drop away, and the whole thing zooms out so that
all all your screens are seen floating in space. It's an amazingly cool
effect that you definitely have to try. By default, the 3D-Desktop default view
is a carousel with all of your virtual desktops assembled in a circular
presentation (Figure 5). Left and right cursor keys let you move from
one desktop to the other. When you have the virtual desktop you want,
press the spacebar or the Enter key. The virtual desktop you've chosen
zooms back in and the screen shifts to normal view. It's cool.
It's fun. And it's useful too.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7889f5.large.jpg"><img src="7889f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The 3D-Desktop default is a carousel.
</p></div></div><p>
To experience 3D-Desktop, you need to get it on your system, so head on
over to SourceForge and pick up a copy (see Resources). Source
packages are available from the site along with a couple of different binary
packages (SuSE and Red Hat) as well as a source RPM. You also are likely to find
it on the contrib site for your particular distribution, but if
you need to build from source, it isn't difficult. You need the Mesa
GLU and Imlib2 development libraries, but aside from that,
this is another example of the classic extract-and-build five step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf 3ddesktop-0.2.7.tar.gz
cd 3ddesktop-0.2.7
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
Running the program is a matter of typing
<tt  >3ddesk</tt>. However,
the first time, you should run the program with the
--acquire option. Starting the program this way serves two
purposes. The first is to see whether the server portion of the program
(3ddeskd) is running and to start it if it isn't. The second is
literally to acquire images of all of your current virtual desktops. A
lot of people tend to run four virtual desktops. I run eight. This
process takes only a second or two. Immediately after that, the magic happens
and your 3-D switcher is running.
</p><p>
Once you have chosen a virtual desktop and returned to your work,
you'll find yourself having to run <tt  >3ddesk</tt> again next time.
To get around that, map an unused function key to run the program. I
used F2 in KDE so that pressing F2 switches me to the 3D-Desktop view
with a single touch. Different desktop environments do it differently,
but this is how it is done with KDE (the 3D-Desktop Web site has
suggestions for other environments).
</p><p>
Right-click on the big K (application launcher) and select Menu
Editor. When the menu edit window pops up, navigate down the side to
your application of choice (you may need to add a 3D-Desktop menu item by
clicking File followed by New Item on the menu bar). Click on the entry
for 3D-Desktop and look down on the right-hand side near the bottom of
that window. See the Current shortcut key button? It probably says
None. Next, click that button. A window appears waiting for you
to enter a keystroke. Press F2 (or whatever sequence amuses you),
and then press Apply. You now can close the menu editor.
</p><p>
You may want to play with some of the command-line switches. Although
the default carousel view is my personal favorite, other
interesting modes include linear, flip and more. For a taste of
childhood nostalgia, try the viewmaster mode by typing <tt  >3ddesk
--mode=viewmaster</tt>. Type <tt  >3ddesk
--help</tt> for more
examples.
</p><p>
It appears, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that closing time has once again snuck up on
us. I'm sure, however, that I can convince Fran&ccedil;ois to top up our guests'
glasses one more time. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois. I must confess that this
wine is particularly good. It's making me think that a plain, flat, real
desktop is really what we need at this time&mdash;a good solid surface
for resting our wineglasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Until next time,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
let us all drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
