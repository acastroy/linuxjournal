Segfault When Allocating Memory</h4><p>
I compiled an application that causes a segfault when
run. The expected size of allocated memory is expected
to be large, less than 1000000. The offending line
seems to be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sample_space=calloc(sample_space_size, sizeof(float));
</pre>
</p><p>
This is likely to result in the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sample_space=calloc(820510, 4);
</pre>
</p><p>
The program compiles fine with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc a2.c -o a2 -lm -lfftw3 -lz
</pre>
</p><p>
Any suggestions?

</p><p>
When you allocate memory, you must check to be
sure you actually received the memory block you
requested. If not, the memory allocation functions,
such as calloc, return NULL. Dereferencing NULL
generates a segfault. It's possible you're hitting
a user quota limit. Run <tt  >ulimit -a</tt> to see what your
limits are currently set to. See <tt  >man ulimit</tt> for
information on how to change these values and <tt  >man
calloc</tt> for more information about how these allocation
functions work.


<br><br>&mdash;<br> Chad Robinson  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:chad@lucubration.com">chad@lucubration.com</a>
</p><p>
I suggest you arm yourself with gdb. Compile using
the -g option and run under the debugger. When your
program gets a segfault, you can do a trace-back. A
nice graphical interface to gdb, called ddd, is available.
Become familiar with these tools, and your life
will be much better.

X Magic Cookies?</h4><p>
I recently upgraded to KDE 3.3, and now find that I am
having problems with my magic cookies whenever I run
a graphical program with su. For example, here is
what happens in a typical attempt to launch xadminmenu:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@toad:/home/nathan/Desktop# xadminmenu
root@toad:/home/nathan/Desktop# Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by
server
Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key

Gtk-WARNING **: cannot open display: :0.0
</pre>
</p><p>
If I first copy .Xauthority from /home/nathan to /root/, it works. My
magic cookies are all happy. I have tried using <tt  >xauth
add</tt> to make it
so that root's magic cookies match my own, but it fails each time for
toad:0 and unix:0 and works for toad:10 and unix:10. Am I missing
something obvious here, other than that I should break down and read up
on X? Is my only real choice to run a quick Perl script on login that
copies .Xauthority over so I don't have to do it manually? At present,
I'd really rather not use yet another hack to keep my system running.

Several situations can be the cause of your problem:
</p><p>
1) Make sure you have the DISPLAY variable set in your environment, it
should be set to something like :0.0 or localhost:0.0.
</p><p>
2) Make sure your account has ownership permissions on the
actual X display you are trying to use. That is, if your account is the
one permitted to own/use the display. Use the xhost command to find
out which user's client programs can use your display, including local
ones. Do a <tt  >man xhost</tt> to learn about the options for this command.
</p><p>
3) The Xlib: Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key message also may indicate
that an X server already is running in your system as display 0.
Before running xadminmenu or any other X command, do a <tt  >ps
ax</tt> to find out
if there is an X process already running. If so, try changing to that
display with Ctrl-Alt-Fx, Fx being one function key on your keyboard;
F7 is commonly used for display 0.
</p><p>
4) Do a <tt  >man startx</tt> to find options for starting X; there are many
options and combinations for doing so.

Missing Library</h4><p>
Where might I obtain the libmp3lame.so.0 library? I need it for mplayer.
When I tried to install the RPM packages for mplayer, it informed me that
I need this library, whatever it is.

</p><p>
Install the lame and lame-libs packages. I believe the latest
version for Red Hat is 3.92-2. An excellent search
tool for RPM packages is <a href="http://www.rpmfind.net" target="_self">www.rpmfind.net</a>.

Microsoft Authentication for Linux VPN</h4><p>
I've been looking for information on how to set up a
Linux box as a VPN server and have it authenticate
against Microsoft Active Directory. I don't want
to maintain two separate lists of users and passwords.
Can you point to me any
sources you might know of on how to do it, assuming
it's possible?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Richard Rosenheim  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:rlr0304@rlrmail.com">rlr0304@rlrmail.com</a>
</p><p>
The same question came up on the SourceForge mailing
list for Poptop, a Linux VPN server that supports
Windows clients. One user provided a collection of
information resources that should get you started:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5787492&amp;forum_id=8250" target="_self">sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5787492&amp;forum_id=8250</a>.
</p><p>
Before beginning this project, it would be a good
idea to get a simple Samba file server set up on the
machine and authenticate against your Microsoft
directory. Even if you later disable the services,
there are numerous guides for doing so, it will
provide the core support services that Poptop can
use to do the same thing.

Drivers for Network Card</h4><p>
I recently got a new computer and decided to install
Linux on the old one. I installed LinuxMandrake
10.0, and everything is working well so far except
for accessing the Internet. There aren't any Linux
USB drivers for the modem I use, so I tossed an old
network card I had lying around into the computer. I
think it's a Realtek 8139, but I'm not sure. The
sticker on the back reads Farallon PN993, but Linux
and Windows both recognize it as a Realtek 8139.
</p><p>
I found a tutorial for the card at
<a href="http://www.scyld.com/rtl8139.html" target="_self">www.scyld.com/rtl8139.html</a> and thought, &ldquo;Great,
step-by-step instructions.&rdquo; So, I downloaded the
four files, moved them to my Linux PC and followed
the instructions. When I got to the first compiling
line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make KERNVER=`uname +-r` rtl8139.o
</pre>
</p><p>
I pressed Enter, but all I got was a ton of errors
flying across the terminal. I tried the other
compiling option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -DMODULE -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O6 -c rtl8139.c
</pre>
</p><p>
and I got the same errors. I then tried the other suggested compile line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ -O6 -c rtl8139.c
</pre>
</p><p>
and again got the same errors. I even tried adding:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-I/usr/src/linux/include -include /usr/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h
</pre>
</p><p>
to every compile option. I'm new to Linux, and I
don't know where to go from here. I've tried using
the 8139too driver that came with LinuxMandrake,
but when I select it, it says it's installing,
but it actually goes back to the screen where I say
that I want to choose the driver manually. I'm in a
never-ending loop. Could anyone help? Thanks.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Sean Bowman  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:poliwhirl74@mn.rr.com">poliwhirl74@mn.rr.com</a>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the driver you referenced in the URL above was designed
for 2.4 kernels, and Mandrake 10.0 includes a 2.6 kernel (2.6.3). The 2.6
kernel series included numerous changes to how driver modules are built, so
many 2.4 drivers no longer work. Fortunately, the 8139 driver has long been a
part of the kernel source tree, so you almost certainly don't need to go
through these gyrations.
</p><p>
The real answer is to continue to pursue why Mandrake is putting you
into an endless installation loop for this driver. You probably would be best
off posing your question on the Mandrake support site, a free resource that
generally provides fast answers to most Mandrake-related problems
(<a href="http://www.mandrakeexpert.com" target="_self">www.mandrakeexpert.com</a>).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> Chad Robinson  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:chad@lucubration.com">chad@lucubration.com</a>
</p><p>
Mandrake Linux's Web site states that Realtek 8139 cards are supported;
being RTL 8139 reported as supported hardware and RTL-8139C and RTL-8139D
as officially tested LAN cards. Now, I would suggest that you use the
appropriate driver as a loadable kernel module. There are actually three
possible drivers, one is rtl8139, another is 8139too and lastly 8139cp,
with the two latter ones used in most current Linux distributions.
</p><p>
Try issuing, as root, the command <tt  >modprobe 8139too</tt>,
<tt  >modprobe 8139cp</tt> or <tt  >modprobe
rtl8139</tt>. There is a
high probability that you already have the required
kernel module compiled and ready to use from your
stock installation of Mandrake 10. If all this works
fine, you may need to add a line like the following
to your /etc/modprobe.conf file for automatic
loading of kernel modules at boot time (of course,
use the working module, in the example 8130too):

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias eth0  8139too
</pre>


<br><br>&mdash;<br> Felipe Barousse Bou&eacute;  <br><br><br><a href="mailto:fbarousse@piensa.com">fbarousse@piensa.com</a>
</p><p>
Almost always when a network card is supported by the
distribution, you don't need to do anything to have
it work on boot. If you don't have any important
data on the system, simply re-install, and Mandrake
should detect the card automatically and choose its
preferred driver.
