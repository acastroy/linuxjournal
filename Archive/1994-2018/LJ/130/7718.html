When users misconfigure software by mistake, the help desk suffers too.
Here's how to lock in sensible choices for important options.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268d580.0x2785298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
One of the more powerful aspects of the KDE
desktop is the ability to customize
the user experience completely. Most KDE programs use core
features and plugins provided by the desktop system,
creating a consistent user interface and easy-to-access configuration setup. One popular extension to
this interface, known as KDE's Kiosk Mode, allows a
system administrator to configure all aspects of the
desktop for an end user and optionally prevent the
end user from making modifications to the provided
setup.
</p><p>
KDE applications utilize a configuration framework
similar to Microsoft Windows INI files. One benefit of this
file type is the ease of direct manual editing of the
configuration file by an administrator or user. The
INI file format is an ordinary text file that is
divided into smaller named sections, each section
having one or more key/value pairs. These values are
used and stored directly by the applications:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[GroupName]
key=value
key2=value2
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Configuration files are located in a number of places, largely based on
which distribution is being used. When an application attempts to find
its configuration, it scans according to a predefined search order. The
list of directories that are searched for config files is seen by
using the command <tt  >kde-config --path config</tt>. The directories
shown actually are searched in the reverse order in which they are listed. This search order is put together by the following set of rules:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
/etc/kderc: a search path of directories can be specified within
this file.
</p></li><li><p>
KDEDIRS: a standard environment variable that is set
to point KDE applications to the installation directories of KDE
libraries and applications. It most likely already is set at
login time. The installation directory of KDE automatically is
appended to this list if it is not already present.
</p></li><li><p>
KDEDIR: an older environment variable now considered
deprecated in favor of KDEDIRS. If KDEDIRS is set, this variable is
ignored for configuration.
</p></li><li><p>
The directory of the executable file being run.
</p></li><li><p>
KDEHOME or KDEROOTHOME: usually set to ~/.kde. The former is for
all users, and the latter is for root.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Configuration files are stored in directory trees that end
in /share/config, so an environment variable directory like KDEHOME
has a /share/config appended to it to make the configuration file
directory name.
</p><p>
When an application requests its configuration information, KDE
searches all of the above directories for the files that go with the
application and merges them together into one configuration object for the
program. Information is combined on a key-by-key basis&mdash;any conflicts
receive the value that was read latest in the chain. Because KDEHOME
files always are read last, any local user changes made to the file
always override values in other configuration files. This is the reason
the output directories of the <tt  >kde-config</tt> command
are shown in
reverse order&mdash;they are listed based on the precedence of the config
files contained within.
</p><p>
Because the configuration file values cascade downstream,
system administrators can preset certain configuration values in an
upper-level directory to be used as the default for all users,
or at least until those users make any changes. For example, if the system
administrator wanted to set a default wallpaper for all users, until
those users made custom changes, a simple edit of the kdesktoprc file
in an upper-level configuration directory would provide this feature:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[Desktop0]
...
Wallpaper=/usr/kde/3.3/share/wallpapers/custompaper.jpg
...
</pre>
</p><p>
One of the features of KDE's Kiosk Mode is the ability to lock values read
from configuration files earlier in the chain so that values read later
cannot override them. This utility not only allows system administrators
to preset certain configuration items, but it also lets the administrators
lock those configuration items down so that end users cannot make custom
changes. Locking configuration values in this fashion is easy.
</p><p>
Assume an administrator wants to lock the Konqueror configuration down
so that the navigation toolbar always is presented in text form. A
simple scan of the $KDEHOME/share/config/konquerorrc file shows the
following information:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KonqMainWindow Toolbar mainToolBar]
IconText=TextOnly
...
</pre>
</p><p>
This configuration item specifies that Konqueror use Text instead of
Icons in the Main Toolbar. Changing this value in Konqueror is
easy&mdash;right-click on a Konqueror toolbar and select Text Position to change
between settings. Figures 1 and 2 show the difference in toolbars with
text and icons.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7718f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Konqueror Main Toolbar with the TextOnly Setting
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7718f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Konqueror Main Toolbar with the IconOnly Setting
</p></div></div><p>
To lock this value for users, the administrator simply can create or
edit konquerorrc in a higher-level configuration directory. To make this
value unchangeable, simply edit the file as shown:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[KonqMainWindow Toolbar mainToolBar]
IconText[$i]=TextOnly
</pre>
</p><p>
The above [$i] specifies that this configuration value is
immutable, meaning Konqueror should use this configuration
value and <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> merge in any values in lower-level directories that
normally would override this setting. Any configuration files farther down the
configuration directory structure containing [KonqMainWindow Toolbar
mainToolBar] group cannot override the IconText value.
</p><p>
Once this file is saved and Konqueror is restarted, any changes to
the navigation toolbar's Text Position are not saved between
Konqueror restarts. This is because the value was locked in an
upper-level configuration directory, so it cannot be overwritten in a
lower-level directory.
</p><p>
On a larger scale, whole groups of configurations can be specified as
immutable. Setting the group as immutable makes all values in that group
immutable as well. For example, in KCalc's configuration file, kcalcrc:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[Precision][$i]
fixed=true
precision=12
...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268d580.0x27861b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
starting kcalc with the Precision group set as immutable makes changing
these values impossible. Figures 3 and 4 show the difference between
the locked and unlocked kcalc Precision settings.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7718f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The kcalc General Settings Dialog with Locked Precision Settings
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7718f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The kcalc General Settings Dialog with Unlocked Precision
Settings
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, the whole configuration file for the application can be made
immutable by placing a [$i] at the very top of the file. This immutable
mark cascades to all group and key/value pairs contained within the
file. Setting the configuration file to immutable in this fashion completely
disallows any changes made to an application's configuration.
</p><p>
Alternatively, if the KDE application does not have write access to
the configuration file, it also is considered to be an immutable
configuration file. This file permission restriction can be
set directly on configuration files in the KDEHOME directory to prevent a user
from editing the configuration.
</p><p>
For example, saving a non-writable kickerrc file restricts users
from making any changes to the kicker panel. Many other KDE applications
follow a similar procedure, though a restart of the application may be
required in order for it to re-read its new configuration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7718f5.large.jpg"><img src="7718f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A kicker with its configuration file marked as immutable. It has
a noticeable lack of handles, which allows the applets contained within to
be customized.

Figure 6. The Normal Kicker
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268d580.0x2786aa8"></a>
Action Restrictions</h2></div></div><p>
On top of being able to lock configuration items for users,
administrators also can remove the functionality of certain actions
users can perform. An action is simply something the user can perform,
such as File&rarr;New. Because most KDE applications provide common actions,
predefined standard action restrictions are easy to lock down. Program
action restrictions are configured in the kdeglobals file, located in
the same configuration directory structure noted above.
</p><p>
The following code snippet disables the standard Help menu available
from the main toolbar of KDE applications:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KDE Action Restrictions][$i]
action/help=false
...
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7718f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Konqueror with Help
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7718f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Konqueror without Help
</p></div></div><p>
Another option is disabling the Bookmarks feature of Konqueror.
This can be accomplished like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KDE Action Restrictions][$i]
action/bookmarks=false
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Not all action restrictions have to be menu items. For example, the
following snippet disables any options that require root access:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KDE Action Restrictions][$i]
user/root=false
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Many more actions can be set. A more complete list can
be found in the kiosk documentation. Many of the actions are standard
across KDE applications. Some applications, however, provide their
own local actions, which can be restricted as well. Some of the more
interesting actions are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
print/system: disables the ability to select the printing system.
</p></li><li><p>
shell_access: disables ability to start up a shell.
</p></li><li><p>
logout: disables user logouts.
</p></li><li><p>
run_command: disables Alt-F2 run command.
</p></li><li><p>
lineedit_text_completion: disables lineedits from remembering previous
entries for partial text completion.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268d580.0x2b7f7a0"></a>
Restricting Other Resources</h2></div></div><p>
On top of configuration files, KDE applications utilize other types of
resources
in the KDEDIRS directories. Similar to the configuration file examples above,
these resources are extended by resource files installed in KDEHOME. KDE
provides the ability to restrict access to these types of files as
well. This configuration information is stored in the kdeglobals
configuration file. For example, the following kdeglobals snippet
limits users' ability to add and utilize custom icon sets
other than the ones already existing in an upper-level resource
directory:


<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KDE Resource Restrictions][$i]
icon=false
...
</pre>
</p><p>
A list of resource types defined by KDE is shown in Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x268d580.0x2b7f958"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Resource Types

Control Center Restrictions</h2></div></div><p>
Although the Control Center menu items can be removed, it still is possible
for users to control settings. Control Center restrictions can
be set to ensure users cannot make many global system changes.
</p><p>
The following section in kdeglobals disallows users from accessing
the respective control modules. A complete list of modules can be seen
by using the <tt  >kcmshell --list</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KDE Control Module Restrictions][$i]
kde-crypto.desktop=false
kde-clock.desktop=false
...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x268d580.0x2b80ea8"></a>
URL Restrictions</h2></div></div><p>
KDE even provides the ability to restrict URLs entered into Konqueror
or another program using KDE's internal URL libraries. To block URL
access to a specific Web site, use the following in kdeglobals:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
[KDE URL Restrictions][$i]
rule_count=n
rule_1=open,,,,http,example.com,,false
rule_2=open,,,,file,,/mnt/share,false
rule_3=list,,,,file,,/mnt/cdrom,true
...
rule_n=...
...
</pre>
</p><p>
The format for the rules is:
rule_N=&lt;action&gt;,&lt;referrer protocol&gt;,&lt;referrer host&gt;,&lt;referrer
path&gt;,&lt;URL
protocol&gt;,&lt;URL host&gt;,&lt;URL path&gt;,&lt;enabled&gt;. Any option that isn't
listed explicitly matches all by default.
</p><p>
The first rule above restricts users from accessing the example.com
Web site. The second rule blocks a user from opening or saving any file in the
/mnt/share directory. The third rule blocks users from even
seeing a list of files in the /mnt/cdrom directory.
</p><p>
The following rules prevent users from accessing a certain domain
using http, forcing them to use https instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
..
[KDE URL Restrictions][$i]
rule_count=2
rule_1=open,,,,http!,*example.com,,false
rule_2=open,,,,https,*example.com,,true
..
</pre>
</p><p>
The URL Restriction convention is to match protocols of similar name,
so a rule involving http would also encompass https. In the above
example, http! is used to match only http and not https.

KDE Kiosk Tool</h2></div></div><p>
Recent work on automating the kiosk environment has led to the production
of a Kiosk Admin Tool (see the on-line Resources). This program automates
the administration of many of the advanced kiosk features KDE
supports. The administrator can customize many of the items covered
in this article using the Kiosk Admin Tool without the need for manual
editing of the configuration files. The Kiosk Admin Tool also allows the
administrator to create multiple kiosk profiles, maintain the profiles
on a central machine and dispatch the configuration framework over a
network with a protocol like SSH. Although the tool does not yet support
every possible configuration value that could be customized, future
versions are sure to add more configurability.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
By using the advanced configuration features that KDE's Kiosk framework
provides, the desktop experience can be completely customized. Whether
it's administering multiple workstation configurations or simply providing
a default configuration for new users, administrators have more than
enough power at their fingertips to create the desired configuration
result. This article barely begins to scratch the surface of possible
configuration items. Experience and experimentation will provide more
insight into all of the items available to create a customized desktop
configuration.
