Managed desktops aren't only for big companies.
Time you spend babysitting a misconfigured
computer is time you aren't pursuing a real business goal.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e83580.0x1f7b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When big companies deploy hundreds or thousands of
managed systems or thin clients, they report spending
a fraction of the administrator time needed to keep
up with a legacy desktop OS. Big projects can yield
big Linux desktop savings.
</p><p>
But getting the time-sucking monster of desktop
computers under control is even more important for
small businesses. At many companies, the front-line
IT support person is the business owner. IBM's Board
of Directors doesn't cancel a meeting because of
a virus or spyware crisis. But a small company's
decision-maker can fall victim to one.
</p><p>
When a company van becomes unreliable, business owners
trade it in for a good one. It isn't worth wasting an
entrepreneur's limited time and energy on a product
that doesn't pull its weight.
</p><p>
This issue, Chip Coldwell covers how to convert
existing or low-cost PC hardware into easily
manageable thin clients, on page 46. Although you
might plan to buy real thin clients for future
expansion, a PC conversion lets you use a common set
of hardware spares for your servers, full desktops
and lightweight desktops.
</p><p>
Caleb Tennis highlights a useful feature of today's
Linux desktops on page 60. You can centrally manage
the configuration items that don't need to change
from user to user. Now, you'll be able to solve the
&ldquo;I can't print&rdquo; support question in a fraction of
the time, because you won't have to put back all the
configuration options that the user tweaked trying
to print.

<i  >Linux Journal</i> manages our article flow using DocBook,
but there are other ways to handle documents
efficiently. On page 56, Cezary M. Kruk, our colleague at
Poland's number one Linux magazine, explains how
OpenOffice.org fills the bill.
</p><p>
If you're developing desktop software, we have plenty
to think about in this issue too. Get the facts on
D-BUS from Robert Love on page 52, and learn how to
keep desktop applications aware of each other and
the other events on the system. And, give users a
versatile search tool for all the different file
formats on your system using libferris, which Ben
Martin covers on page 78.
</p><p>
Put your IT time, or your employees' time, to better
use. Deploy and develop software that really
helps with the business process, instead of just
fighting fires to keep a glorified typewriter and fax
machine going. We'll cover some examples next issue.
Getting the desktop under control is step one.
