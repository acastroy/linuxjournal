You'll enjoy the programming ease and built-in peripherals of
the new generation of microcontrollers. Best of all, with these
tools you can develop for the popular AVR series using a Linux host.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203a298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Whether you are creating a small Internet appliance, some hardware
instrumentation, data loggers or an army of autonomous robots to do your
bidding, in numerous situations you need the flexibility
of a programmable computer. In many cases, a general-purpose system,
such as the workhorse sitting under your desk, doesn't meet size, cost or
power-consumption constraints and is simply overkill. What you need is
a microcontroller.
</p><p>
This article provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a complete development system
for the Atmel AVR series of microcontrollers, using free software and
Linux. The detailed instructions provided here will allow you to transform your Linux system
into a complete AVR development environment. This article walks you through
all the steps of building, debugging and installing a simple program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203a3f8"></a>
What Is a Microcontroller?</h2></div></div><p>
When all the electronic components required to make a central
processing unit (CPU)&mdash;instruction decoder, arithmetic/logic unit,
registers and so on&mdash;are integrated into a single chip, you have a
microprocessor. When, in turn, you bundle this CPU with supporting
components, memory and I/O peripherals, you've got a microcomputer.
Extending the integration and miniaturization even further, you can
combine all the elements of a microcomputer onto a single integrated
circuit&mdash;behold the microcontroller.
</p><p>
The semiconductor industry evolves rapidly, making it difficult
to provide an accurate and complete definition of the term
microcontroller. Consider this: some microcontroller chips have
capacities and clock speeds that surpass the 74KB of
program memory and 4KB of RAM available to the 30kg Apollo
Lunar Module computer. You can expect today's screamer PCs to be
running tomorrow's embedded applications, with the definition of
microcontroller shifting accordingly.
</p><p>
Microcontrollers all have a microprocessor core, memory and I/O
interfaces, and many have additional peripherals onboard. The
specific configuration of a particular chip influences its physical
packaging, number of pins and cost. If you are accustomed to working
with microcomputers, you may feel that microcontrollers are
tight spots. They have a handful of kilobytes of program ROM and
in the area of 256 bytes of RAM. Don't fret though; a lot can be
done in this space, as the MIT Instrumentation Lab
demonstrated when developing the Apollo Lunar Module software that controls
its moon landing, return from the surface and rendezvous in orbit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203a5b0"></a>
AVR Microcontrollers</h2></div></div><p>
The AVRs are 8-bit RISC platforms with a Harvard architecture (program
and data memory are separate). Figure 1 details the ATtiny26 AVR chip
internal organization. Like each member of a family, it has its own
particular combination of I/O and peripherals, but it shares a basic
architecture and instruction set with all the other AVRs. The ATtiny26
has 2KB of program Flash memory, 128 bytes of onboard SRAM and EEPROM,
two 8-bit counters and pulse-width modulators, 11 interrupts, 16 I/O
pins spread over two 8-bit ports, an 11-channel 10-bit analog-to-digital
converter and more&mdash;all on a single tiny 20-pin DIP.
</p><p>
A number of factors make the AVR microcontrollers a good choice,
especially for beginners. AVRs are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Easy to code for: AVRs were designed from the ground up to
allow easy and efficient programming in high-level languages, with a particular focus on C.
</p></li><li><p>
Easy to program: the combination of onboard reprogrammable
Flash program memory and the in-system programming interface keeps the process of
transferring software to the microcontroller
simple and cheap.
</p></li><li><p>
Powerful and inexpensive: AVRs pack a lot of power (1 MIPS/MHz,
clocks up to 16MHz) and space (up to 128K of Flash
program memory and 4K of EEPROM and SRAM)
at low prices. Most AVRs even include additional
peripherals, such as UARTs and analog-to-digital
converters.
</p></li><li><p>
Hobbyist-friendly: most of the chips in the AVR family come in easy-to-use
8-, 20-, 28- or 40-pin dual in-line packages (DIPs)
and can be ordered in unit quantities from a number
of distributors.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7289f1.large.jpg"><img src="7289f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. ATtiny26 Block Diagram
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203abe0"></a>
CPU</h2></div></div><p>
The processor core, composed of the components in the upper-left
portion of Figure 1, includes elements to read the program memory and
to decode and execute the instructions within that memory. The CPU also can fetch
and store data to and from the EEPROM, SRAM and the 32 registers.
The registers act as extremely efficient storage for 8-bit values
(1 byte), and the ALU (arithmetic/logic unit) can operate directly on each
of the 32 registers. This AVR features a RAM-based stack.
In a few other AVRs, which don't have any SRAM, the stack is
hardware-based, limiting the stack depth to three.
</p><p>
Most instructions take only a single clock cycle to execute, and there
is no internal clock division on AVRs. The CPU fetches and decodes the next instruction as it is executing the current instruction. These
combined facts mean that AVRs can reach performances of nearly 1 MIPS
(million instructions per second) per MHz. With clock rates of up to 16MHz,
you can choose the right balance of speed, power consumption and
electromagnetic noise for your particular application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203ad40"></a>
Memory</h2></div></div><p>
Program space is a contiguous block of Flash memory, 16-bits wide that
can be erased/rewritten 10,000 times. You can design your circuit to
allow firmware upgrades in-circuit, using in-system programming.
</p><p>
All AVRs have some EEPROM, and most have SRAM; both are 8-bits wide.
The EEPROM is designed to withstand at least 100,000 erase/write
cycles. EEPROM is useful because it can be written from within
your embedded program to retain data, even without a power supply,
or during programming, such as for production-line calibration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203aea0"></a>
I/O and Peripherals</h2></div></div><p>
All AVRs, from the tiny 8-pin DIPs to the 44-pin Megas, have at least
one data port. Data ports allow for input or output of logic-level
data. The AVR ports are bidirectional, allowing you to set them for
input or output on a pin-by-pin basis.
</p><p>
Many of the AVRs include additional hardware peripherals, such as UARTs
for serial communication and calibrated RC oscillators used as internal
system clocks. The external pins often serve two or more purposes,
and how they are used depends on how you've configured the
microcontroller. For instance, Figure 1 shows that certain I/O lines
from both ports can be used with the multiplexed A/D converter.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b000"></a>
Development Workstation Setup</h2></div></div><p>
The set of tools described here isn't the only one available, but it
allows you to do basically anything, and the tools function well together.
The toolkit is comprised of
Binutils, GCC, AVR Libc and our Makefile template
to write and build programs for the AVR microcontrollers;
GDB and simulavr to debug your software; and
avrdude as well as a hardware programmer
to transfer your software to the microcontrollers.
See the on-line Resources for download URLs for all software.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the recent versions of all these tools include support for the AVR
platform, so installation is straightforward. We assume you've chosen
to install everything under /usr/local/AVR.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b160"></a>
Binutils</h2></div></div><p>
Download a fresh copy of the current binutils source by following the
link in the Resources. Untar the source,
move into the binutils-X.XX directory and run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/AVR --target=avr
$ make
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
The /usr/local/AVR/bin directory now contains AVR versions of ld,
as, ar and the other binutils executables. Add the /usr/local/AVR/bin
directory to your PATH now. You can apply the modification system-wide
by adding:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/AVR/bin"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to the /etc/profile file. Make sure the directory is in your PATH and
that the change has taken effect before proceeding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b478"></a>
GCC</h2></div></div><p>
After retrieving a recent release of the Gnu Compiler Collection from
a mirror, run the following commands
from within the unpacked top-level source directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/AVR \
        --target=avr --enable-languages="c,c++" \
        --disable-nls
$ make
# make install

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b5d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This builds C and C++ compilers for AVR targets and installs avr-gcc
and avr-g++ in /usr/local/AVR/bin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b6e0"></a>
AVR Libc</h2></div></div><p>
The AVR Libc package provides a subset of the standard C library for AVR
microcontrollers, including math, I/O and string processing utilities.
It also takes care of basic AVR startup procedures, such as initializing
the interrupt vector table, stack pointer and so forth. To install, get the
latest release of the library
and run the following from the top-level source directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ unset CC
$ PREFIX=/usr/local/AVR ./doconf
$ ./domake
# ./domake install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b840"></a>
Makefile Template</h2></div></div><p>
The Psychogenic team has created a standard Makefile template that
simplifies AVR project management. You can customize it easily for
all your assembly, C and C++ AVR projects. It provides everything for a
host of make targets, from compilation and upload to the microcontroller
to debugging aids, such as source code intermixed with disassembly,
and helpful gdbinit files. A detailed discussion of the template is
available, and the
Makefile template is available as Listing 1 on the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
FTP site (see Resources). Store the template with
the other AVR tools, moving it to /usr/local/AVR/Makefile.tpl.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203b9a0"></a>
GDB and SimulAVR</h2></div></div><p>
Using avr-gdb and simulavr in tandem, you can run your software on a
choice of AVR microcontrollers through the simulator, while using GDB to
step through and observe the executing code.
Acquire the simulavr source from the project site
and perform the
installation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/AVR \
  --with-avr-includes=/usr/local/AVR/avr/include
$ make # make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Install GDB, built for AVR targets, by compiling the source
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure --target=avr \
     --prefix=/usr/local/AVR
$ make
# make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x203bbb0"></a>
AVRDUDE</h2></div></div><p>
When you finally have a program ready for testing on actual
hardware, you need some way to upload the data and write it to the
microcontroller's Flash program memory. AVRDUDE and a compatible hardware
programmer are the last components of the development kit.
Grab a copy of the AVRDUDE source
and install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/AVR
$ make
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
You now have installed every software component required for a complete
AVR development environment. All you need is the physical means to
transfer programs to microcontrollers.
</p><p>
AVRDUDE supports a number of different hardware programmer
configurations. The simplest systems are described on the AVRDUDE
site and are comprised of little more than a parallel port connector,
a ceramic oscillator and a DIP socket. These are powered directly off
the computer's port and may not work for everyone.

Figure 2. Home-Brew PPI Programmer PCB
</p></div></div><p>
A step up in complexity, independently powered, buffered in-system
programmers can be built easily (see Resources).
Two programmers
requiring only a few parts are discussed on the Psychogenic Web page, which describes
the schematics, provides artwork and has complete instructions on
creating your own printed circuit boards (as depicted in Figure 2)
for the programmers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7289f3.large.jpg"><img src="7289f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Atmel STK500 Development Kit
</p></div></div><p>
A number of commercial solutions also are available. If you're interested
in easily programming a wide selection of the AVR family, go with Atmel's
STK500 kit. More than a simple programmer, the STK500 is a starter kit
that allows you to program the microcontrollers and easily prototype
new designs. It includes a number of LEDs and switches, an oscillator,
RS-232 interface and other niceties that easily can be interfaced with
your target chip.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2032a70"></a>
A Complete AVR Project</h2></div></div><p>
Our focus here is on the development system rather than on programming
for the AVR platform. The AVR Libc documentation is a good place to
start for information on programming AVRs in Assembly, C and C++.
</p><p>
The Hello World program of the microcontroller universe is the
classic flashing LEDs. A slightly different take on this theme,
which <span   class="emphasis"><em>Knight Rider</em></span> fans should appreciate, is available on the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site, where
you can download C (Listing 2) or C++ (Listing 3) versions of an
example program that cycles each of eight light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) back and forth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2032c80"></a>
Building the Program</h2></div></div><p>
Create a project directory&mdash;for instance, ~/helloavr/&mdash;and retrieve
the program, saving Listing 2 as ~/helloavr/kr.c and Listing
3 as ~/helloavr/kitt.cpp. Also, copy the Makefile template,
/usr/local/AVR/Makefile.tpl, to ~/helloavr/Makefile.
</p><p>
Using this Makefile is easy and makes compilation a snap. Open the
Makefile in your favourite editor and modify the configuration section,
near the top of the file, so that the MCU, PROJECTNAME and PRJSRC
variables are set as shown in Listing 4. The MCU variable determines the AVR
family member for which we are compiling the program, and the PRJSRC
variable lists all the Assembly, C and C++ source files used
in the project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2032de0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. HelloAVR Project Makefile Configuration Options
</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#####         Target Specific Details          #####
#####     Customize these for your project     #####

# Name of target controller
# (e.g. 'at90s8515', see the available avr-gcc mmcu
# options for possible values)
MCU=at90s8515

# Name of our project
# (use a single word, e.g. 'myproject')
PROJECTNAME=helloavr

# Source files
# List C/C++/Assembly source files:
# (list all files to compile, e.g. 'a.c b.cpp as.S')
# Use .cc, .cpp or .C suffix for C++ files, use .S
# (NOT .s !!!) for assembly source code files.
PRJSRC=kr.c

</pre></div><p>
Once you've configured the Makefile, compiling and linking the program
is as simple as typing <tt  >make</tt>.
</p><p>
You can perform the compilation and linking steps manually instead,
by issuing:

<pre     class="programlisting">

  $ avr-gcc -I.  -g -mmcu=at90s8515 -Os       \
             -fpack-struct -fshort-enums               \
             -funsigned-bitfields -funsigned-char \
             -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -c kr.c

  $ avr-gcc -o helloavr.out kr.o

</pre>
</p><p>
The most notable difference is the addition of the required -mmcu
command-line argument, used to specify the target microcontroller.
Either method compiles kr.c and creates the helloavr.out ELF-format
program. This file cannot be executed on your development station but
is used later during the debugging stage.
</p><p>
You also can build the C++ version of the program by doing a
<tt  >make clean</tt>,
changing the Makefile PRJSRC variable to kitt.cpp and then issuing another
<tt  >make</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2033258"></a>
Debugging the Program</h2></div></div><p>
A Makefile target that is interesting, whether for sanity checking,
optimization, low-level debugging or simply to get to know the AVR
internals, is disasm. Running:
<tt  >$ make disasm</tt>
prints some information concerning the program, such as its
text/data/bss size, to the console and creates helloavr.s. This file
contains a disassembled version of the executable, intermixed with the
original C source code. A peek inside reveals AVR Libc and avr-gcc's
work behind the scenes, initializing the interrupt vector table and data,
followed by the Assembly and C versions of the program.
</p><p>
Now we use GDB as a source-level debugger with simulavr running as
a remote target. To do so, launch simulavr in the background and create
a suitable gdbinit file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ simulavr --gdbserver --device at90s8515  &amp;
$ make gdbinit

</pre>
</p><p>
Running <tt  >make</tt> in this manner creates gdbinit-helloavr, a file containing
instructions for setting up GDB correctly, such that it connects to a
simulavr, loads the compiled program, inserts a breakpoint and begins
execution. Launch avr-gdb using the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ avr-gdb -x gdbinit-helloavr
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2033570"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you are presented with the GDB prompt; program execution is
halted before the first instruction in main(). Set a breakpoint on
line 71, using <tt  >b 71</tt>, and enter C (continue) a few times. Every time
you step over the instruction on line 71:

<pre     class="programlisting">
71       PORTB = ~currentValue;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2033728"></a></h2></div></div><p>
~currentValue is output through PORTB. You should see a message to
that effect, for example, <tt  >writing 0xff to 0x0038</tt>. When you are done, issue a
<tt  >quit</tt> and kill the simulavr process, which is running in the background.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x20338e0"></a>
Installing the Program</h2></div></div><p>
If you've built or purchased the programmer hardware, you can
install and test the software on a real AT90S8515 chip. Configure the
avrdude section in the Makefile by setting the AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMERID and
AVRDUDE_PORT variables, as explained in the comments above. Use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMERID=stk500
AVRDUDE_PORT=/dev/ttyS0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2033a40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
for an STK500 programmer connected to the first serial port. Ensure that
the programmer is connected to the appropriate port, insert the
microcontroller in the programmer, apply power and type
<tt  >make writeflash</tt>.
This generates the hex file used by AVRDUDE and writes its contents
to the chip's Flash program memory.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7289f4.large.jpg"><img src="7289f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. HelloAVR Program Test Circuit
</p></div></div><p>
For those using the STK500 development kit, simply connect PORTB to the
eight onboard LEDs using the ten-wire cable (as illustrated in Figure 3),
and watch <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>das blinkenlights</i></span>. You can set up your own test hardware by
constructing the schematic shown in Figure 4, which connects LEDs with
suitable limiting resistors such that each pin of PORTB can activate
one by going low and sinking current.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f42580.0x2033e08"></a>
Where to from Here?</h2></div></div><p>
You've seen the flashing LEDs? Congratulate yourself; you are ready to
begin creating your own AVR designs and software. See Resources
for loads of AVR-related information and projects. There's
almost no limit to what you can do.
</p><p>
Atmel shares a number of interesting project ideas through its AVR
application notes, where it details implementation of stepper motor
controllers, IR remote control receivers and transmitters and even an
embedded Web server.
One amazing project, ContikiOS (see Resources), distributes an open-source Internet-enabled, multitasking, graphical operating system that
has been ported to the AVR and uses a version of the VNC server instead
of a regular screen.
</p><p>
Enjoy experimenting with these versatile microcontrollers, be sure to
share your discoveries and good luck building that robot horde!
