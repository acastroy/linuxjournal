Replace text on the fly, without even starting an
editor, using this classic tool.

The filter sed can process text from standard
input and write its results to standard output. The
input can be redirected from a file, and the output
also can be redirected to a file using your shell's
redirection capabilities.
It has hundreds of uses, and once you learn sed, you
really would miss it if you lost it.
</p><p>
sed can append lines, remove lines, change lines,
rearrange lines, substitute text strings and
more. Using sed, you can write simple scripts that
can become powerful text manipulating commands.
</p><p>
sed can use regular expressions to define what processing will occur
on lines of text and which lines it processes. If you have
never seen or used regular expressions before, you may want to become
familiar with the basic syntax of regular expressions. In this article, we
use a few regular expressions to make sed do some simple text processing.

Ways to Run sed</h2></div></div><p>
sed can be run on the command line as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat sample.txt | sed -e '1,15d'
</pre>
</p><p>
You can cat the file sample.txt and use the pipe
to redirect its output (the lines of text) into
the sed command. The -e option to sed tells it
to use the next item as the sed command. The d
command tells sed to delete lines 1&ndash;15 of
the input stream, which in this case is the lines
read from sample.txt. The rest of the file (if any)
appears on standard output, your terminal window,
unless redirected elsewhere.
</p><p>
Also, you simply can specify the input file as a command-line argument,
so the above sed command also can be written as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed -e '1,15d' sample.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can tell sed to read commands from a script file
by using the [-f script-file] option.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd99660"></a>
sed Command Format</h2></div></div><p>
A sed command has this format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[pattern1][,pattern2][!] command [args]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd997c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The pattern1 and pattern2 are optional line ranges. Some commands don't
use the patterns, some commands use only one and some can use both to
specify a range of lines that the sed command can operate on, as we
did in our simple example above.
</p><p>
pattern1 and pattern2 can be numbers, in which case they are treated like
line numbers. They can also be a regular expression delimited by slashes
(/pattern/). When using regular expression patterns, all lines that
match the expression are filtered through the sed command.
</p><p>
If no pattern is specified, the sed command operates on every
line of input.
</p><p>
The ! causes sed to operate on every line not included in the pattern
range. You can change our example above to be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat sample.txt | sed -e '1,15!d'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd99a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This command deletes all lines except lines 1&ndash;15.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd99b30"></a>
A Few sed Commands</h2></div></div><p>
Here are a few basic sed examples. These can all be run right from the
command line. Testing and debugging your sed commands individually on
the command line before integrating them into a larger script will save
you a lot of time that otherwise would be spent debugging the commands
from within a running script.
</p><p>
Let's say that you have a file that lists customers called
customer.txt. For the following examples, it contains simple lines of text,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Sam Jones
Brenda Jones
Carl Simon
Liz Smith
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's use some sed commands to manipulate this file. For example, if you
want to remove lines containing Carl Simon and update your customer
file, you can do the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">

cat customer.txt | \
sed -e '/Carl Simon/d' &gt; customer.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
The pattern /Carl Simon/ is used by sed as a regular expression and
matches every line that has that pattern somewhere on the line. The
d command deletes every line that matches the pattern. So, any
lines containing Carl Simon are removed from the file.
</p><p>
If you want to perform some type of text substitution on a text file, the
s command is probably what you are looking for. It substitutes one
text string for another. We tend to use this a lot in our scripts. For
example, if Sam Jones calls up and tells you that you should have him
listed as Samuel Jones, you can use this command to make the change:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat customer.txt | \
sed -e 's/Sam Jones/Samuel Jones/' &gt; customer.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
The s command in sed has three slashes that follow the s. The text between
the first and second slash is the pattern you want to match. The
text between the second and third slash contains the pattern that you
want to substitute for the first pattern. If you wanted all instances of Sam to be
Samuel (not just Sam Jones), you could rewrite this example as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat customer.txt | \
sed -e 's/Sam/Samuel/' &gt; customer.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
The commands for append (a), replace (c) and insert (i) typically need to
have the sed commands specified in a separate script file. For example,
say you want to append the line After Brenda right after the
line that contains the text Brenda. You can use the a sed command to
append the text there. However, you need to put the sed commands
in a separate script file, so fire up your favorite editor and create
the following sed command file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#
# sed command file (# are comment lines)
#
# append the line 'After Brenda'
# in this customer file
#
/Brenda/a\
After Brenda

</pre>
</p><p>
Save this script file as sed1.cmd. Then, to run sed using this script
file, use this syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sed -f sed1.cmd customer.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
You should see the contents of your customer file with the additional
line added after the line Brenda Jones. The pattern /Brenda/ (in the sed
command file) determine where in the output our appended line appears.
</p><p>
The difference between the append command and the insert command is where
the text is added. For the append command, the text is added after the
line containing the match. For the insert command, the text is added
before the line that contains the match.

Three Great Regular Expressions to Know</h2></div></div><p>
For those who have never used regular expressions, here are three regular
expressions that are very useful when combined with sed:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
To match the start of a line, use the ^ character.
</p></li><li><p>
To match the end of a line, use the $ character.
</p></li><li><p>
To match any number of characters in a regular expression, use the
characters .*. The . matches any single character, and the *
matches any number of characters (including none at all).
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd9a4d0"></a>
Practical Examples</h2></div></div><p>
Filter out empty lines from a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sed -e '/^$/d' your_file.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
Add the computer named mycomputer to the end of every line in
/etc/exports:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat /etc/exports |  \
sed -e 's/$/ mycomputer/' &gt; /etc/exports

</pre>
</p><p>
Add the computer named comp2 only to the directories beginning
with /data/ in /etc/exports:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat /etc/exports | \
sed -e '/^\/data\//s/$/ comp2/' &gt; /etc/exports

</pre>
</p><p>
See how the forward slashes used in the directory name have to be escaped
using back slashes? Without the back slashes, sed interprets the forward
slashes in the directory specifier as the delimiters in the sed command
itself. However, the back slashes can make the sed command difficult to
read and follow.
</p><p>
Remove the first word on each line (including any leading spaces and
the trailing space):

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat test3.txt | sed -e 's/^ *[^ ]* //'

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd9a898"></a></h2></div></div><p>
More regular expression matching is used in this example. Here's what
it is doing.
</p><p>
The initial ^ * is used to match any number of spaces at the beginning
of the line. The [^ ]* then matches any number of characters that are
not spaces (the ^ inside the brace reverses the match on the
space), so it matches a single word. The trailing space at the end
matches the space found at the end of the first word. The empty replace
pattern removes the text.
</p><p>
Remove the last word on each line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cat test3.txt | sed -e 's/^\(.*\) .*/\1/'

</pre>
</p><p>
This command introduces the concept of hold buffers. Hold buffers are
used to keep parts of the matched text and to insert that text into the
result. The pattern that matches the text between the parentheses is
recalled in the substitution pattern by the \1. If an additional set
of parentheses were in the match pattern, they would be addressed in the
substitution pattern as \2, and so on, for more sets of parentheses. Up
to nine hold buffers can be specified. In this example, the pattern
contained within the parentheses matches from the start of the line up
to the last space (the space after the parentheses).
</p><p>
To remove leading { and trailing }, or a } from each line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sed -e 's/^.*{\(.*\)},*/\1/' table.txt

</pre>
</p><p>
I'll leave it to the reader to dig in to this regular expression to see
how it operates. Keep this in mind&mdash;the more comfortable you are with
regular expressions and hold buffers, the more powerful the sed command
becomes.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
sed recognizes many other commands. However, even with
these basic commands, you can successfully manipulate text files
from within your own shell scripts or right from the command line.
