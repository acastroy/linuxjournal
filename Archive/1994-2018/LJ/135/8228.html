Please, Fran&ccedil;ois, do not cry. What is making you so sad? The restaurant
looks fantastic, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Everything is ready. What could possibly
be so bad? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You were reading the menu and saw that we would be
featuring terminal programs and that made you sad? Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon
Dieu</em></span> Fran&ccedil;ois, terminal programs have nothing to do with
death; they are
windows to the shell, much like the GNOME terminal, xterm or the
KDE Konsole.
</p><p>
Our guests are arriving, Fran&ccedil;ois. Welcome,
everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where fine Linux fare meets fine wine. Please
sit and make yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois, please go to the wine
cellar and bring back the 1999 C&ocirc;te du Rh&ocirc;ne. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>

While putting together the menu for this Systems Administration-themed
issue, I was somewhat torn. There are, after all, so many different
aspects to this topic. Then, I asked myself what systems administration
tool I use most and came up with an interesting answer&mdash;it's a
command shell run inside some kind of terminal emulator.
Although this may
seem extremely basic, the terminal program has come a long way since
the days of the venerable xterm.
</p><p>
For those of you too young to remember, we call them terminal
programs or emulators as opposed to shell windows,
because they were software desktop equivalents of the terminals
that at one time were connected physically to the mainframe system. But
I digress, and Fran&ccedil;ois has returned with the wine.
</p><p>
I've used quite a number of terminal programs over the years. Originally,
it was a plain xterm, still available on most Linux
systems. Dressing it up meant changing the font color or background
but not much else. For instance, to start a plain xterm with a steel
blue background and red text, I would do the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xterm -background "SteelBlue" -foreground "Red"
</pre>
</p><p>
In time, I discovered another terminal program called rxvt that also
should be included on most systems. It gave me a little more control over
configuration options. It not only looked better than my old xterm, but I could
assign an XPM bitmap image for a background, which made it look pretty cool
at the time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rxvt -pixmap /usr/share/themes/BrushedMetal/gtk/bg.xpm -fg black
</pre>
</p><p>
Then came the first terminal emulator I really fell in love with, one
I still enjoy today. It's called Eterm, and although it was
designed as an xterm replacement for the Enlightenment window manager,
it should work with whatever you have, be it GNOME, XFCE, KDE or anything
else. Check your distribution CDs for this one, as it may not be
installed already on your system. You also can get the latest Eterm from
the Eterm Web site (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
Besides looking great, Eterm offers some cool features. For example,
Eterm can have a variety of background images, and in fact, it
comes with several. Some of these are tiled pixmaps, and others are full
background images (Figure 1). Simply click Background on the Eterm menu bar,
then Pixmap and select from the tiled or scaled pixmaps available.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8228f1.large.jpg"><img src="8228f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Eterm does transparency, backgrounds, themes and more.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can change the font size, brightness, contrast, scrollbar style
and much more. You even can create and customize your own menu. If you
are happy with the settings you have modified, click Eterm on the menu
bar and select Save User Settings.
</p><p>
Eterm is themeable as well. Click the Themes link on the Eterm Web
site, and you will see several themes that can be downloaded and
installed on your system. These all are tarred and gzipped bundles. To install them, create
a .Eterm directory in your $HOME directory and then create a
themes directory below that. All you have to do now is extract
the theme into that directory and it becomes available. To start your
next Eterm with the appropriate theme, name it on the command line
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Eterm -t theme_name
</pre>
</p><p>
One of my favorite features of Eterm, however, is the ability to make
it transparent. I find this particularly nice because it lets me keep
an eye on system logs as they scroll across my desktop and my current
favorite wallpaper. All you have to do is click Background on the menu
bar and select Toggle Transparency. This option doesn't work on KDE, but
it does work on GNOME, WindowMaker and others. To view the Apache logs on my Web
server on my transparent Eterm, I would run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Eterm -O -e sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log
</pre>
</p><p>
This doesn't have anything to do with terminal emulators per
se, but in the above example, you may need to add yourself to the
/etc/sudoers file in order for this to work, unless, of course,
you run the Eterm as root. In my case, I added a line in the file right
below the definitions for root's privileges:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
marcel  ALL=(ALL) ALL
</pre>
</p><p>
These days, there's another feature in terminal programs that has
me excited, and that's tabs. There is no need to open three or four terminal
applications, which can take up a fair amount of real estate. Take a look
at the KDE Konsole program, for instance, or the GNOME terminal. Both
provide not only basic shell access, but they also allow you to run multiple
shells in tabbed sessions. To use tabs on your GNOME terminal, press
Shift-Ctrl-T and you are presented with a new session (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8228f2.large.jpg"><img src="8228f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A GNOME terminal with tabs saves screen real estate.
</p></div></div><p>
The GNOME terminal also supports transparency, so if I want
to start up a script that lets my logs scroll across my wallpaper
<span   class="emphasis"><em>du jour</em></span>, I can do that as well. With the
GNOME terminal, this is done with profiles. To create a profile, click Edit on the GNOME terminal
menu bar and select Profiles. Click New and give your profile a name,
for example, seethrough. When the Editing Profile dialog appears, click on the
Effects tab and click the Transparent background radio button (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8228f3.large.jpg"><img src="8228f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. To create a transparent GNOME terminal, you first need to create a profile.
</p></div></div><p>
Use the slider to adjust the level of transparency and then close the
profile dialog. Now, start the GNOME terminal like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gnome-terminal --window-with-profile=seethrough \
-e "sudo tail -f /var/log/messages"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you like the results, use that command in a shell
script in order to call it by a name that makes sense to you.
</p><p>
In the KDE world, there's Konsole, which also handles tabs nicely. To
start a tabbed Konsole session, click Session on the menu bar and
select New Shell. Then, customize the tabs by double-clicking on them and
giving them a name. When you are running multiple shells&mdash;a compile
here, a monitor session there and a root shell in yet another tab&mdash;naming
your tabs makes a lot of sense. Also notice that when you click the Session
menu, several options are available, including starting a session in a bookmarked
location (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8228f4.large.jpg"><img src="8228f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The amazing Konsole&mdash;tabs, bookmarks and more!
</p></div></div><p>
Bookmarks? As you do your job as administrator, you find yourself going
to the same directories over and over again. Sure, you can type quickly
and get where you want to go, but Konsole extends its capabilities by
letting you assign bookmarks. When you are in that familiar directory
seven levels deep, simply click Bookmarks on the menu bar and then select
Add Bookmark. You can assign a name to the location you want, and open
a shell in that location with a single click.
</p><p>
And, of course, I can't move on without mentioning transparency. To enable
transparency in Konsole, click Settings on the menu bar, then Schema
and select one of the Konsole transparencies from there. While you are
in the Settings menu, you see a ton of configuration options for
the Konsole terminal program. Change the font, go to full-screen mode
and change the encoding, change the keyboard layout or set an alarm to inform you
when changes take place in one of your tabbed sessions. You can explore
the Konsole features on your own, but I will leave you with a nice script
to start a clean, transparent Konsole to track your log file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

konsole --schema Transparent.schema --nomenubar \
  --notabbar --noframe \
  -e sudo tail -f /var/log/messages

</pre>
</p><p>
The final selection on tonight's menu is something so great, I'm frankly
amazed I hadn't seen anything like it before. I decided it was great,
because I started using it regularly as soon as I discovered it. Using
KDE kparts, Simon Perreault created a program called Quadkonsole. As the
name implies, it starts up four Konsole programs in a grid (Figure 5).
There's no need to line up your Konsoles side by side or click from one shell tab
to the next. To make things even nicer, the Quadkonsole creates
only one task in the task bar, leaving your Kicker panel uncluttered. That
feature is going to be particularly useful as I tell you more about this
great terminal program.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8228f5.large.jpg"><img src="8228f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Quadkonsole starts up four Konsoles in a perfect grid.
</p></div></div><p>
Each running Konsole can be modified at will by right-clicking on
it, choosing Settings and then selecting the changes you are interested
in making from the menu. For instance, you may want one to be transparent,
another white on black with smaller fonts and so on. After all, each one
is a Konsole and can be modified accordingly.
</p><p>
If you are feeling particularly distracted, you can tell Quadkonsole
to start with more than four Konsoles. Simply specify the number of
rows and columns, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
quadkonsole --rows 4 --columns 4
</pre>
</p><p>
This command starts up Quadkonsole with 16 individual terminal sessions
(Figure 6). That's why having only one instance in your Kicker panel is
such a nice feature. This also might be a good time to start playing with
the font size if you want the information to fit. In one of my sessions,
I have top, the real-time process and resource monitor, running
with a super-tiny font. Of course, now I need to run a desktop magnifier
such as kmag in order to see it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8228f6.large.jpg"><img src="8228f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. When too much information is just right, Quadkonsole answers the
call.
</p></div></div><p>
By default, the focus follows the mouse pointer, so if you happen to
nudge the mouse accidentally while typing, strange and wonderful things
may occur. To override that default, use the <tt  >--clickfocus</tt>
command option to start your Quadkonsole program. After doing so, you have to
click in each window in order to select a particular Konsole.
</p><p>
I happen to prefer the click-to-focus option, but I don't always like having
to reach for the mouse each time. Luckily, Quadkonsole has that covered
as well. You can navigate from one Konsole instance to another by
using the Shift-Ctrl-arrow key combination. This allows you to
move up, down, left or right from one session to another.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Incroyable!</em></span> It would seem, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, that closing time has once again arrived. If only someone
would write an application that could transform our one instance of leisure
time into four or 16. Too much wonderful wine to savor, too many programs to
explore and certainly not enough time. Do not worry, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>,
I am more than willing to spend a little more time, and Fran&ccedil;ois would be happy
to refill your glasses while you chat. Sit back and enjoy that C&ocirc;te du
Rh&ocirc;ne. Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all
drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre santsant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
