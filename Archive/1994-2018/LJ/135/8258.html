Boo, Belly Dance Cover</h4><p>
I just received my May 2005 issue of the <i  >Linux Journal</i> magazine. I am extremely upset with the
cover picture selected for this issue.
When I subscribed to this journal, I never dreamed my
name would be associated with a &ldquo;pictured&rdquo; magazine
like this.
I was extremely embarrassed for my secretary to
have had to see this when distributing my mail.
I cannot display this on the public table for my other
technicians to use as a reference in the office.
Your company has presented a very volatile Sexual
Harassment Potential in my Federal Government Office.

A Black Wrapper for <i  >LJ</i>?</h4><p>
I am shocked and appalled at the picture on the
cover of this most recent issue [May 2005]. It really should
have come in one of those black wrappers. If I want
to see that sort of smut, I would subscribe to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dr. Dobb's Journal</em></span>!

Yay, Belly Dance Cover</h4><p>
I want to thank you for your interesting feature
article, &ldquo;Belly Dance and Free Software&rdquo; by Dawn
Devine and Michael Baxter [May 2005]. Although it's geared
specifically toward performers, there's much that's
useful for any business or anyone who has events
to promote.
</p><p>
I would particularly like to commend you for
your cover photo, because it explodes so many
misconceptions at once! Too often, the computer world
looks like a boys' clubhouse with a &ldquo;NO GIRLS&rdquo; sign
on the door. To show a woman who's a professional
in the arts, rather than another high-tech or high-business field, is even rarer. Being an artist and
Middle Eastern dancer myself, as well as a Linux-using
computer geek, I'm delighted!

Hello, My Name Is...</h4><p>
When my son was born in 1999, I named him Linus in
honour of Linus Torvalds. I have included here a
picture of me and my son Linus, who will be a future
volunteer in the Linux community.

Penguin Shopping Zone</h4><p>
I'm a Brazilian guy that has used Linux since 1998,
when I worked at Conectiva, I designed (technically)
the project to implant more than 20,000 workstations and
1,000 servers in our public network, here in S&atilde;o
Paulo. This
public network was on the schools and high schools to
offer Internet access to the people who don't have it.
This project was called Linux Na Escola (Linux in
School), and until today, is the biggest project in this
segment on earth. Workstations are all in production,
in more than 500 labs educating thousands of children.
</p><p>
When I went to this supermarket to buy some beers
and bodka, I saw penguins. I and said to my cousin,
&ldquo;Look, Tux brings his family here to buy some fish,
and beers too!&rdquo;

Photo of the Month: Talos the Rally Robot</h4><p>
This photo is of the robot Talos and his
minders, Richard Gardiner, Aristotelis Papadimitriou,
James O'Hea, Sang Hun Lee and Matthew Gray. Talos
is one of four entries in the Cybernetics MEng Robot
Rally Cybernetics ng. challenge project (see
<a href="http://www.cyber.reading.ac.uk/robot_rally" target="_self">www.cyber.reading.ac.uk/robot_rally</a>) and
the only one to use Linux as its operating system.
The challenge project is loosely based on the DARPA
Grand Challenge. On March 17th, the four robots raced
across the Reading University campus. Although none
of the robots completed the course (just like their
DARPA challenge counterparts) all managed to get past
the first leg. Everything now depends on the final
event in June.

Hey, Mom, Block Port 137</h4><p>
Here is a picture of my four-month-old son,
Griffin, looking up information on iptables one
snowbound day in February. He was very helpful.
I have not let him get a hold of my magazine yet.
Somehow I do not think it would survive.

Adding Ham Position Data to GPSDrive?</h4><p>
I read with great interest in the April 2005 issue
of <i  >LJ</i> Charles Curley's article &ldquo;Finding Your Way
with GPSDrive&rdquo;.
With a little additional code, GPSDrive could be
easily modified with code for Automatic Position
Reporting System (APRS) use in emergency services.
With WiFi support, some radio data traffic that are
non-priority, or very large files, could lessen the
load on congested ham radio frequencies. WiFi would be
excellent to backhaul VOIP traffic, pictures and video
and other such things to be shared with emergency
services personnel. The possibilities are endless.
</p><p>
I noticed that one can import USGS maps, or street
maps, but does this software support importing
mapsets from DeLorme? USGS maps leave much to be
desired, as some of the maps date back to before the
1960s. Of course, the topo does not change, but roads are
sometimes nonexistant on these maps. Topo USA I found
to be much better, and also covers current roads.
</p><p>
Regarding Chris McAvoy's reply to Jason Shelton's
letter [<i  >LJ</i>, April 2005], the MAX232 chip from Maxim is a very versatile
chip. The kit for the MAX232 may be inexpensive, but
&ldquo;samples&rdquo; of this chip and others are free. Maxim
has a very extensive line of chips for use in the
computer, electronics and ham radio hobbies.
</p><p>
<i  >LJ</i> is my only connection to the Linux world until
2019. I am in Federal Prison for a victimless
crime. Glad to see that there are other Tux fans in
a microcosm society that sometimes has no justice or
intelligent life.
Please keep up the good work with <i  >LJ</i>. I am glad to see
the radio geek articles, along with articles covering
other hobbies. How about some embedded Linux while
SCUBA diving?

Yes, DeLorme format is one of many supported
by GPSBabel (<a href="http://gpsbabel.sourceforge.net" target="_self">gpsbabel.sourceforge.net</a>).
We'll look for an article on integrating APRS and
GPSDrive.  &mdash;Ed.

Vendor Troubles</h4><p>
I've read many things about Monarch Computers in
your magazine (which I greatly enjoy). However,
my experience with Monarch is less than acceptable.
</p><p>
It took a month to receive our new dual Xeon server,
and it didn't work on arrival. They do not seem to
respond to e-mail or telephone queries about orders or
rma's. The only responses I get are autogenerated.
The voice mail box is full and will not accept
a message.

not get a response.  &mdash;Ed.

Moodle Success Story</h4><p>
I just received the first issue of my <i  >Linux Journal</i>
subscription and I am pleased with every page. I am a
newbie (but learning quickly) and I was surprised to
see a letter from an inmate who finds it difficult
to meet other Linux enthusiasts in prison. I am
also incarcerated and know how hard it is to learn
about Linux since most of the people around here
either use Windows or don't know anything at all
about computers. I don't have access to the Internet
until 2008, but fortunately I've been able to acquire
an excellent job at the Vo-tech here. I set up a
LAMP platform on a Dell Poweredge 4400, a Fedora
workstation for development and 25 Win2k workstations;
and I owe <i  >Linux Journal</i> a debt of gratitude.
</p><p>
Another inmate here introduced me to <i  >Linux Journal</i> and
I read an article about Moodle [December 2004]. We are now happily
using this program, which makes my job easier and
provides me with more time to learn about Linux. I've
seen a few advertisements for Linux certification
programs (such as Linux Professional Institute, Red
Hat and so on) and I wonder which certifications are the
most marketable and recognized by employers. I just
want to focus on getting the best Linux education I
possibly can. Thank you for your wonderful magazine.
</p><p>
PS. I really liked the &ldquo;Linux on a Small Satellite&rdquo;
article [April 2005]. I am interested in Amateur Near Space flight
using helium-filled weather balloons, and I've been
looking for examples of how Linux can be used for
these projects. All of the spacecraft I've seen so far
only use Basic Stamps and PBasic code. If you can do a
piece on near-space sometime, that would be excellent.

Thanks for Shell Tips</h4><p>
<i  >LJ</i> is the most educational computer magazine I have
ever known. I learn something new with every issue,
often several new somethings. The article on Bash
in the April 2005 issue was very enlightening, and I
have used some of the techniques described in shell
scripts used in the Computer Repair class for user
account maintenance on the Linux-based server for
the LAN operated in the class.
</p><p>
Over the past few months I have seen letters written
by other incarcerated persons and want to express
my thanks that <i  >LJ</i> recognizes that while some Linux
enthusiasts may be in prison, the mistakes individuals
like myself have made in the past does not nullify
our abilities to spread the ideals of Linux or our
abilities to make meaningful contributions to Linux
and free software.
</p><p>
Please keep up the excellent work and while I didn't
get to be part of your first ten years, I hope to be
a part of the next ten, twenty, thirty years.

Check Mount Options for Live CD</h4><p>
Thanks for the great piece on building live CDs [April 2005].
The recipe for mounting and chrooting the decompressed
Knoppix tree will work if you do it on a filesystem
mounted the usual &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; way. But I tried it
in my test machine running off a Knoppix CD and it
didn't work.
</p><p>
Knoppix had mounted my hard drive partition
(/mnt/hda5) with no dev options,
so no devices worked in the chrooted environment.
I needed to do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -o remount,dev /mnt/hda5
</pre>
</p><p>
just before giving the chroot command, and everything
worked.
