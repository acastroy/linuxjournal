<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #280, August 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Arnd Bergmann</b></span> has recommended that the minimum
supported <span   class="bold"><b>GCC</b></span> version
be raised to 4.3 and the recommended version to 4.9. However, he plans
to document the fact that folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Geert
Uytterhoeven</b></span> and others
were still using GCC 4.1 to compile recent Linux kernels with success.
</p><p>
According to Arnd's analysis, testing older and older GCC versions
initially would produce more and more unnecessary warnings, making it
more and more difficult to spot legitimate bugs. And beyond a certain
GCC version, linker errors and build failures would begin to appear
for certain architectures, notably <span   class="bold"><b>ARM</b></span>.
</p><p>
He posted a series of kernel patches that grew increasingly ugly as
they had to accommodate older and older GCC versions. Some of these,
he acknowledged, probably would be too ugly to make it into
the kernel.
</p><p>
Protecting the kernel's ability to compile with ancient GCC versions
is valuable work. A lot of enterprise systems can't really be upgraded
without risking massive breakage, and so they just sit there unchanged
for years, chugging along, bringing in revenue. But, the business has
no choice but to upgrade its kernel in order to keep the system
secure. As long as the company can still use all its old tools to do that,
it won't have to worry about the large expenditures needed to retool
the entire system and possibly discover that it can't be done
within the available budget.
</p><p>
The oldest supported version of <span   class="bold"><b>GNU Make</b></span> is being raised from 3.80 to
3.81. <span   class="bold"><b>Masahiro Yamada</b></span> inadvertently broke Linux support for Make 3.80
in 2014 with a cleanup patch that made it into the kernel without
anyone noticing the compatibility issue.
</p><p>
In fact, in the intervening three years, no one else has noticed the
issue either. Instead, Masahiro himself discovered what had happened
and recently suggested updating the documentation to list Make version
3.81 as the official minimum version.
</p><p>
There were no objections of any kind. Being broken for three years
with no one noticing is a fairly good argument in favor of dropping
support for a given version of a tool. Even <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>, in his
comment to the thread, seemed to indicate that this time period was
enough to claim there were no active users of a given version.
</p><p>
As in the case of GCC, if even a single active user can be found for
an old version of a tool, the Linux folks will make a big effort to
continue to support that version. But as shown in the case of Make,
with no such users standing forth, no such effort will be made.
</p><p>
The filesystem mounting API has been needing an update to help
distinguish between a variety of actions that user code might take.
But, it's also been needing new features to support modern ideas like
containers for virtualization. Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>David
Howells</b></span> addressed the
latter, posting some patches to implement mount contexts. These would
hold various binary data, along with the mount options, for use by the
code performing the mount or by the filesystem itself.
</p><p>
This is valuable because it allows more detailed error reporting,
which is useful for something like filesystem mounting that can fail
in many different ways. But as Miklos Szeredi put it, David's code
didn't go far enough to clean up the overall mount API.
</p><p>
Miklos wanted the mount API to have sharp distinctions between
creating a filesystem instance, attaching a filesystem within an
existing mounted directory, editing the superblock and adjusting the
mount properties. David's work did this a little, but not enough, said
Miklos.
</p><p>
But, David wasn't convinced of the necessity of having such extremely
sharp distinctions between actions that were, after all, very closely
related.
</p><p>
Ultimately, Miklos agreed that &ldquo;everything that works now should work
the same way on the old as well as the new interfaces.&rdquo; This way at
least, there would be no breakage, and other developers could pick up
where David's work left off.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Clip-on Lenses</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #280, August 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My Sony Xperia phone takes fairly nice photos. You can see in Figure 
1 that it's pretty clear, with nice color. The thing is, I want to
livestream my daughters' volleyball and basketball games this year,
and my phone just doesn't have a wide enough angle to capture the entire
court. So, I figured I'd try some of the clip-on wide angle lenses for
phones. But honestly, the results are a bit disappointing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12213androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This is my backyard taken with my Sony Xperia.
</p></div></div><p>
The first lens I tried (the larger one on the left of Figure 2) is the
$10 Zomei 0.6x lens (<a href="http://a.co/3b3AdGC" target="_self">a.co/3b3AdGC</a>). This lens feels solid and
heavy with good-looking glass and a metal lens case. The
&ldquo;clippy&rdquo; part
attaches with plastic threads, but still, it feels solid. Unfortunately,
it didn't provide very much more coverage, and the wideness it did give
made for a pretty ugly image (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213androidf2.large.jpg"><img src="12213androidf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Oddly, the cheaper lens felt nicer but performed worse, and
the more expensive lens felt cheaper but performed better.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213androidf3.large.jpg"><img src="12213androidf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. This lens felt so solid, I expected much better results.
</p></div></div><p>
The other lens I tried was a $12 Amir, 140&deg; wide angle lens that
does 0.4x (<a href="http://a.co/2Ozkc5d" target="_self">a.co/2Ozkc5d</a>). This is a much smaller
lens, and it feels much cheaper. The coverage and photo are actually fairly similar to the
Zomei, but it's actually a bit nicer. Plus, the smaller size makes the
phone less unwieldy when taking a photo. As you can tell in Figure 4,
it's still not a great picture, but it is wider than the phone can
do natively.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213androidf4.large.jpg"><img src="12213androidf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. This has a wider angle and a clearer picture, but both were
disappointments.
</p></div></div><p>
My advice? If you have to take a wide angle shot with a phone, step back
a bit to get a wider angle the old-fashioned way. Clip-on lenses are a
great idea, and they do technically work, but if you're expecting the same
quality photo your phone can take natively, you'll be sadly disappointed.

<h2 class="title">My Quest for Inbox Zero</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #280, August 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've never been able to accomplish &ldquo;inbox zero&rdquo; for more than a couple
hours. Part of it is due to poor organization on my part, and part of it
is due to being too busy. The problem isn't that I get more email than
I can handle (although that's probably true, I get a couple hundred
messages a day), it's that most messages require a followup that I
can't accomplish immediately. I've tried to move items I need
to handle later quickly into a to-do list like Wunderlist, but it's an extra
step that takes more time, so I just let things pile up in my inbox.
</p><p>
For some reason, I recently decided to try Google Inbox. It's not a new
offering from Google, but I think it's matured since I originally tried
it years ago. See, Google Inbox allows me to keep inbox zero with minimal
effort and zero guilt. Here's the premise:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
When an email comes in, a quick swipe to the right will archive
it. It's not even a click&mdash;just a swipe and it's gone.
</p></li><li><p>
If I need to open it, I can tap it, then click a check box to archive
it if I don't need to follow up.
</p></li><li><p>
Here's the beauty. If I need to follow up on a message, even if it's
just something interesting I want to read later at my leisure, I can
snooze it. In the screenshot, you can see the options for snoozing,
and they work perfectly.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213googlef1.large.jpg"><img src="12213googlef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The idea of snoozing email isn't new. I remember using
&ldquo;boomerang&rdquo;
for such a thing a few years ago. But Google Inbox has integrated the
snooze and archive features so well that I can clear my inbox
<span   class="emphasis"><em>completely</em></span>
in moments and not worry that I've forgotten something. In fact, the
snooze feature works much better than just leaving stuff in my inbox,
because it actually comes back to my attention after the snooze period
instead of falling off the end of my inbox.
</p><p>
Thanks to a fast, minimalist take on achieving inbox zero, I'm giving
Google Inbox this month's Editors' Choice award. It's not a new product,
but it has revolutionized my life. You can check it out without messing
up your regular Gmail inbox by logging in at <a href="http://inbox.google.com" target="_self">inbox.google.com</a> in
a web browser or by downloading the mobile app. You won't regret it!

<h2 class="title">Litebook</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #280, August 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader Kevin Bruce dropped me an email about a
too-good-to-be-true laptop from the folks at Alpha Store (<a href="https://alpha.store" target="_self">https://alpha.store</a>). The
laptop is a 14", quad core, 1080p laptop with a 512GB hard drive for
$249. My old Dell D420 has finally given up, so I was in the market for
a fairly inexpensive laptop. I decided to order one. I opted for the
$269 model with a hybrid drive, but everything else is the same as the
base model. Rather than a full review, here are my quick takeaways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The screen is amazing. Really. It's bright, vibrant and has incredible
colors. The screen makes my D420 look like garbage, and upon first boot,
I was giddy to see how amazing it looked.
</p></li><li><p>
The keyboard is a little springy, but tolerable. The plastic keys feel
a little cheap, but the action is fine. It reminds me of typing on
a Macbook Pro, but with looser, cheaper plastic for the actual keys.
</p></li><li><p>
The trackpad is horrible&mdash;and not just the sort of horrible that is
annoying, but the sort of horrible that makes you unwilling to use the
computer for anything other than typing or watching movies. It has an
unpredictable scrolling feature, poor response and a cheap feel, and its
complementing buttons are just as bad. The trackpad makes the entire
experience unpleasant, and unless you're okay using an external mouse,
I'd abandon ship.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There are also a few strange quirks, but none of them would have been
a showstopper for me. The included Wi-Fi driver has weird issues with
sleeping, so I found myself rebooting occasionally when the laptop lost
connectivity. This isn't uncommon when you're trying to run Linux on
a laptop that obviously was made for Windows, and I'm fairly certain
finding the right driver would help.
</p><p>
The hybrid hard drive was really just a 32GB SSD device with the entire
Elementary OS installed and a 512GB device that had four NTFS partitions
on it. I could delete the partitions and reclaim the space, but it was
a strange &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; experience.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213litef1.large.jpg"><img src="12213litef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, you can see two things in the photo. One, I have a really awesome
cat. Two, the &ldquo;red&rdquo; model I bought is clearly pink. Not just pink, but hot
pink. The white label even says it's pink, but the Alpha Store insists I
bought a red laptop. The forums show other people with the same issue, so
apparently to the Alpha folks, pink and red are the same thing. Honestly,
I think the pink looks cooler than red anyway, but it was odd.
</p><p>
My advice to Kevin? Unless you want to use an external mouse, avoid this
computer. The display is absolutely gorgeous, but the trackpad makes it
almost unusable. The whole computer feels cheap, but that's not
surprising for such an inexpensive model. If you're looking for a cheap
laptop computer, I think the best option is to get a used one like the
Lenovo Yoga 11e or something. They're nice machines, have better hardware
(apart from maybe the screen), and you can get them for about the same price.

<h2 class="title">Microsoft Office on a Linux Machine?!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #280, August 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My middle child is headed to college this fall, and although the college
doesn't require a specific type of computer, it does require students to
have Microsoft Office. Not Microsoft Office-compatible, but specifically
Microsoft Office. That bums me out, but I figured Office 365 might be
just the answer for a daughter who doesn't want to get a Windows laptop.
</p><p>
The coolest part about Office 365 is that college students can get it
free if they have a college email account. The free subscription doesn't
include a downloadable, installable version of Office, but for Linux
users, that doesn't matter. The online version is all we'd be able to
use anyway, so for a college student, Microsoft Office doesn't actually
include a Microsoft tax.
</p><p>
The surprising part? Office 365 works great on Linux. No really. I opened
a few native Microsoft files and created a few of my own. The OneDrive
storage worked wonderfully from the web browser, and even printing
worked well. You can see in the screenshot that Microsoft converts the
document into a PDF file so it can be printed natively on whatever system
you're using.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213officef1.large.jpg"><img src="12213officef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
I'm surprised to report that Office 365 works so well on Linux, but it honestly
does. For a college student, the online offering might be enough to meet
all the requirements most colleges have for software. Even if you aren't
a fan of Microsoft and its products, I recommend at least trying Office
365 if you're in a position that requires Microsoft Office, because it
sure beats installing Windows 10!

<h2 class="title">Emacs for Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #280, August 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I typically cover software packages that do actual calculations to
advance scientific knowledge. But for this article, I am covering a slightly
stranger tool in the arsenal of 
scientific computation. 
</p><p>
Emacs is a text editor that has almost all
the functionality of an operating system. A collection of
enhancements and configuration settings are available bundled under
the name of scimax. Being an Emacs user myself, I was surprised I'd never
heard of it before now. This project has been in development for some
time, but it recently has started to find wider attention. 
</p><p>
Before installing it,
however, you need to install the latest version of Emacs to
get all of the needed functionality. As with most of my articles,
I am assuming that you are using a Debian-based distribution. You
can install Emacs by using the daily snapshot package,
available at the official launchpad archive. Install it
with the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-elisp/ppa
sudo update
sudo install emacs-snapshot
</pre>
</p><p>
This will ensure that you have the latest and greatest version. 
</p><p>
Once this is
installed, go ahead and install the scimax code itself. You can
get it from the main GitHub repository with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Start it with the command:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
emacs-snapshot -q -l path/to/scimax/init.el
</pre>
</p><p>
The first time you do this, there will be a lot of activity while Emacs
downloads and installs the full suite of extra packages you need
in order for the scimax code to have all of the required dependencies.
</p><p>
When you finally have everything installed and start scimax, you will
see several new menu items in your Emacs session.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12213scif1.large.jpg"><img src="12213scif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You will see several new menu item entries at the top of your Emacs window.
</p></div></div><p>
The real driving need behind all of the work that has gone into scimax is
to make research more easily reproducible and to handle documentation
of your research with minimal extra overhead. 
</p><p>
Since you want to work
with organized documents within Emacs, the base of scimax is built on
top of org-mode. Org-mode, by itself, is probably something you will
want to look into as a potent tool. Scimax takes this powerful core
and makes it easier to use with a series of shortcuts. 
</p><p>
Because of 
org-mode's power, it would be time well spent if you learned at least
the basics of how to use the main parts of this package. Org-mode has
a markup syntax of its own, and scimax adds a layer of shortcuts that
make it easier to write. 
</p><p>
Along with the regular org-mode markup syntax,
scimax makes it easier to include LaTeX sections for more advanced textual
layout. Many people in scientific fields are familiar with LaTeX. For those
who aren't, LaTeX is document layout program where you write your text
and include layout instructions for the LaTeX engine. The idea is that
you separate out the text from the formatting of that text. 
</p><p>
If you have
graphical images as part of your research, scimax has added some extra
functionality to make image rescaling and presentation better than the
org-mode defaults by using external programs from the imagemagick package.
</p><p>
Because org-mode is designed to be a document structuring package for
Emacs, it allows for exporting your text into a great many other
formats. Also, since it separates out the formatting from the actual text,
it can be applied to many different document structures, such as articles,
books or web pages. 
</p><p>
Scimax uses the ox-manuscript Emacs package to handle
exporting to high-quality document formats. This is useful when you
need to produce final versions of your scientific reports or articles
in a format like PDF. 
</p><p>
Bibliographic references within your document
are handled through bibtex entries.
</p><p>
So far, I've covered a quick
overview of the document management, organization
and formatting tools that are provided through scimax, but Emacs and
org-mode have much more functionality.
You can interact with the outside world in a few different ways. The
first is through email. You can grab selections of your text, or an entire
buffer, and issue an <tt  >org-mime</tt> command within Emacs to tell it to send
an HTML-based email. Depending on your system, you may need additional
configuration in order for this to work as expected. 
</p><p>
The other
way to interact with the outside world is through Google searches. As
someone who writes a fair bit myself, I cannot understate the need for a
Google window to be open to be able to verify some fact or statement as I
am writing. With scimax, the <tt  >google-this</tt> Emacs package gets installed
and is available as you are working. This allows you to fire up
Google searches based on either specific text selections or the contents
of entire buffers immediately from the document that you are working on.
</p><p>
Along with communicating with the outside world, the other powerful
interaction with external tools is through org-mode's ability to run
external programs and have their output inserted into sections of your
document. This one piece of functionality makes the dream of reproducible
research a real possibility. You do need to be diligent and put it
into practice, but you no longer have the excuse of saying that it
isn't possible. The idea is that, from within your org-mode document,
you can define a block of code that makes some calculation or generates
some graph. You then can have org-mode fire this block so that it can
be run through an external engine and have the results pulled back
in and inserted as the displayed text in the original location. 
</p><p>
The
default engine configured in scimax is Python, which is definitely a
good starting point. With more configuration, you can add support for
several other languages. The powerful idea here is that you always
can go back to the original code that generated some result or some graph
and re-create it. More and more scientific journals are demanding this
level of reproducibility, so having it as part of your article contents
directly means you never will lose track of it.
</p><p>
The last thing I want to cover is how to organize all of the work
that scimax is helping you do. The highest level of organization is
the ability to set up projects. A project is essentially a directory with
all of the associated files for that given project. These projects are
handled by the Emacs projectile package. This package allows you to move
between projects, find files within projects or do full searches through
a given project. 
</p><p>
Projectile assumes that these project directories are
under some kind of version control system, such as Git. Luckily, scimax
includes the magit Emacs package, which adds lots of extra functions that
allow you to interact with the Git repository that the current file
belongs to directly from Emacs. You can create or clone repositories,
stage and commit changes, manage diffs between versions, and even handle
pushes to and pulls from remote repositories. Along with the explicit
control over a Git repository, scimax includes extensions to org-mode to
handle track changes, as well as to insert edit marks within
your org-mode document. 
</p><p>
Putting all of this organizational work together,
scimax provides the ability to create and use scientific notebooks.
A series of commands starting with <tt  >nb-</tt> allow you to wrap all
of the organizational functionality to create, manage and archive these
notebooks. Now, you have no reason not to start documenting all of your
scientific research in a reproducible way&mdash;except maybe the learning
curve. But, as the old saying goes, nothing worth doing is easy, and I
think this is definitely worth doing, at least for some people.
