Ansible: the Automation Framework That Thinks Like a Sysadmin

With Ansible, managing 50 servers is a lot like managing one server!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x27ff358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've written about and trained folks on various DevOps tools through the years, and
although they're awesome, it's obvious that most of them are designed from the
mind of a developer. There's nothing wrong with that, because approaching
configuration management programmatically is the whole point. Still,
it wasn't until I started playing with Ansible that I felt like it was
something a sysadmin quickly would appreciate.
</p><p>
Part of that appreciation comes from the way Ansible communicates with its
client computers&mdash;namely, via SSH. As sysadmins, you're all very familiar
with connecting to computers via SSH, so right from the word
&ldquo;go&rdquo;, you
have a better understanding of Ansible than the other alternatives. 
</p><p>
With that in mind, I'm planning
to spend my next few articles learning how to take advantage of
Ansible. It's a great system, but when I was first exposed to it, it wasn't
clear how to start. It's not that the learning curve is steep. In fact,
if anything, the problem was that I didn't really have that much to learn
before starting to use Ansible, and that made it confusing. For example,
if you don't have to install an agent program (Ansible doesn't have any
software installed on the client computers), how do you start?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x27ff618"></a>
Getting to the Starting Line</h2></div></div><p>
The reason Ansible was so difficult for me at first is because it's so
flexible with how to configure the server/client relationship, I
didn't know what I was supposed to do. The truth is that Ansible doesn't
really care how you set up the SSH system; it will utilize whatever
configuration you have. There are just a couple things to consider:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Ansible needs to connect to the client computer via SSH.
</p></li><li><p>
Once connected, Ansible needs to elevate privilege so it can configure
the system, install packages and so on.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Unfortunately, those two considerations really open a can of
worms. Connecting to a remote computer and elevating privilege is a
scary thing to allow. For some reason, it feels less vulnerable when you
simply install an agent on the remote computer and let Chef or Puppet
handle privilege escalation. It's not that Ansible is any less secure,
but rather, it puts the security decisions in your hands. 
</p><p>
Next I'm going to
list a bunch of potential configurations, along with the pros and cons
of each. This isn't an exhaustive list, but it should get you thinking
along the right lines for what will be ideal in your environment. I
also should note that I'm not going to mention systems like Vagrant,
because although Vagrant is wonderful for building a quick infrastructure
for testing and developing, it's so very different from a bunch of
servers that the considerations are too dissimilar really to compare.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x27ff9e0"></a>
Some SSH Scenarios</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>1) SSHing into remote computer as root with password in Ansible
config.</em></span>
</p><p>
I started with a terrible idea. The &ldquo;pros&rdquo; of this setup is that it
eliminates the need for privilege escalation, and there are no other user
accounts required on the remote server. But, the cost for such convenience
isn't worth it. First, most systems won't let you SSH in as root without
changing the default configuration. Those default configurations are
there because, quite frankly, it's just a bad idea to allow the root
user to connect remotely. Second, putting a root password in a plain-text configuration file on the Ansible machine is mortifying. Really,
I mentioned this possibility because it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a
possibility, but it's one
that should be avoided. Remember, Ansible allows you to configure the
connection yourself, and it will let you do really dumb things. Please
don't.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>2) SSHing into a remote computer as a regular user, using a password
stored in the Ansible config.</em></span>
</p><p>
An advantage of this scenario is that it doesn't require much
configuration of the clients. Most users are able to SSH in by default,
so Ansible should be able to use credentials and log in fine. I
personally dislike the idea of a password being stored in plain text
in a configuration file, but at least it isn't the root password. If
you use this method, be sure to consider how privilege escalation
will take place on the remote server. I know I haven't talked about
escalating privilege yet, but if you have a password in the config file,
that same password likely will be used to gain sudo access. So with one
slip, you've compromised not only the remote user's account, but also
potentially the entire system.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>3) SSHing into a remote computer as a regular user, authenticating with
a key pair that has an empty passphrase.</em></span>
</p><p>
This eliminates storing passwords in a configuration file, at least for
the logging in part of the process. Key pairs without passphrases aren't
ideal, but it's something I often do in an environment like my house. On
my internal network, I typically use a key pair without a passphrase to
automate many things like cron jobs that require authentication. This
isn't the most secure option, because a compromised private key means
unrestricted access to the remote user's account, but I like it better
than a password in a config file.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>4) SSHing into a remote computer as a regular user, authenticating with
a key pair that is secured by a passphrase.</em></span>
</p><p>
This is a very secure way of handling remote access, because it
requires two different authentication factors: 1) the private key
and 2) the passphrase to decrypt it. If you're just running Ansible
interactively, this might be the ideal setup. When you run a command,
Ansible should prompt you for the private key's passphrase, and then it'll use
the key pair to log in to the remote system. Yes, the same could be done
by just using a standard password login and not specifying the password
in the configuration file, but if you're going to be typing a password
on the command line anyway, why not add the layer of protection a key
pair offers?
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>5) SSHing with a passphrase-protected key pair, but using ssh-agent to
&ldquo;unlock&rdquo; the private key.</em></span>
</p><p>
This doesn't perfectly answer the question of unattended, automated
Ansible commands, but it does make a fairly secure setup convenient
as well. The ssh-agent program authenticates the passphrase one time
and then uses that authentication to make future connections. When
I'm using Ansible, this is what I think I'd like to be doing. If I'm
completely honest, I still usually use key pairs without passphrases,
but that's typically because I'm working on my home servers, not something
prone to attack.
</p><p>
There are some other considerations to keep in mind when configuring your SSH
environment. Perhaps you're able to restrict the Ansible user (which
is often your local user name) so it can log in only from a specific IP
address. Perhaps your Ansible server can live in a different subnet,
behind a strong firewall so its private keys are more difficult to access
remotely. Maybe the Ansible server doesn't have an SSH server installed on
itself so there's no incoming access at all. Again, one of the strengths
of Ansible is that it uses the SSH protocol for communication, and it's
a protocol you've all had years to tweak into a system that works best in
your environment. I'm not a big fan of proclaiming what the &ldquo;best
practice&rdquo; 
is, because in reality, the best practice is to consider your environment
and choose the setup that fits your situation the best.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x2800170"></a>
Privilege Escalation</h2></div></div><p>
Once your Ansible server connects to its clients via SSH, it needs
to be able to escalate privilege. If you chose option 1 above,
you're already root, and this is a moot point. But since no one
chose option 1 (right?), you need to consider how a regular user on
the client computer gains access. Ansible supports a wide variety of
escalation systems, but in Linux, the most common options are sudo and
su. As with SSH, there are a few situations to consider, although
there are certainly other options.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
1) Escalate privilege with su.</em></span>
</p><p>
For Red Hat/CentOS users, the instinct might be to use su in order
to gain system access. By default, those systems configure the root
password during install, and to gain privileged access, you need to
type it in. The problem with using su is that although it gives you total
access to the remote system, it also gives you total access to the remote
system. (Yes, that was sarcasm.) Also, the su program doesn't have the
ability to authenticate with key pairs, so the password either must be
interactively typed or stored in the configuration file. And since it's
literally the root password, storing it in the config file should sound
like a horrible idea, because it is.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
2) Escalate privilege with sudo.</em></span>
</p><p>
This is how Debian/Ubuntu systems are configured. A user in the
correct group has access to <tt  >sudo</tt> a command and execute it with root
privileges. Out of the box, this still has the problem of password
storage or interactive typing. Since storing the user's password in the
configuration file seems a little less horrible, I guess this is a step
up from using su, but it still gives complete access to a system if the
password is compromised. (After all, typing <tt  >sudo su
-</tt> will allow 
users to become root just as if they had the root password.)
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
3) Escalate privilege with sudo and configure NOPASSWD in the sudoers
file.</em></span>
</p><p>
Again, in my local environment, this is what I do. It's not perfect,
because it gives unrestricted root access to the user account and doesn't
require any passwords. But when I do this, and use SSH key pairs without
passphrases, it allows me to automate Ansible commands easily. I'll note
again, that although it is convenient, it is not a terribly secure idea.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
4) Escalate privilege with sudo and configure NOPASSWD on specific
executables.</em></span>
</p><p>
This idea might be the best compromise of security and
convenience. Basically, if you know what you plan to do with Ansible,
you can give NOPASSWD privilege to the remote user for just those
applications it will need to use. It might get a little confusing,
since Ansible uses Python for lots of things, but with enough trial
and error, you should be able to figure things out. It is more work,
but does eliminate some of the glaring security holes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x28007a0"></a>
Implementing Your Plan</h2></div></div><p>
Once you decide how you're going to handle Ansible authentication and
privilege escalation, you need to set it up. After you become well versed
at Ansible, you might be able to use the tool itself to help
&ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo;
new clients, but at first, it's important to configure clients manually so
you know what's happening. It's far better to automate a process you're
familiar with than to start with automation from the beginning.
</p><p>
I've written about SSH key pairs in the past, and there are countless
articles online for setting it up. The short version, from your Ansible
computer, looks something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ssh-keygen
# ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_dsa.pub remoteuser@remote.computer.ip
# ssh remoteuser@remote.computer.ip
</pre>
</p><p>
If you've chosen to use no passphrase when creating your key pairs,
that last step should get you into the remote computer without typing
a password or passphrase.
</p><p>
In order to set up privilege escalation in sudo, you'll need to edit
the sudoers file. You shouldn't edit the file directly, but rather use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# sudo visudo
</pre>
</p><p>
This will open the sudoers file and allow you to make changes safely
(it error-checks when you save, so you don't accidentally lock yourself
out with a typo). There are examples in the file, so you should be able
to figure out how to assign the exact privileges you want.
</p><p>
Once it's all configured, you should test it manually before bringing
Ansible into the picture. Try SSHing to the remote client, and then try
escalating privilege using whatever methods you've chosen. Once you have
configured the way you'll connect, it's time to install Ansible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x2800bc0"></a>
Installing Ansible</h2></div></div><p>
Since the Ansible program gets installed only on the single computer,
it's not a big chore to get going. Red Hat/Ubuntu systems do package
installs a bit differently, but neither is difficult.
</p><p>
In Red Hat/CentOS, first
enable the EPEL repository:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo yum install epel-release
</pre>
</p><p>
Then install Ansible:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo yum install ansible
</pre>
</p><p>
In Ubuntu, first
enable the Ansible PPA:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-add-repository spa:ansible/ansible
(press ENTER to access the key and add the repo)
</pre>
</p><p>
Then install Ansible:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x27f7818"></a>
Configuring Ansible Hosts File</h2></div></div><p>
The Ansible system has no way of knowing which clients you want it to
control unless you give it a list of computers. That list is very simple,
and it looks something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# file /etc/ansible/hosts

[webservers]
blogserver ansible_host=192.168.1.5
wikiserver ansible_host=192.168.1.10

[dbservers]
mysql_1 ansible_host=192.168.1.22
pgsql_1 ansible_host=192.168.1.23
</pre>
</p><p>
The bracketed sections are specifying groups. Individual hosts can be
listed in multiple groups, and Ansible can refer either to individual
hosts or groups. This is also the configuration file where things like
plain-text passwords would be stored, if that's the sort of setup you've
planned. Each line in the configuration file configures a single host, and
you can add multiple declarations after the
<tt  >ansible_host</tt> statement. Some
useful options are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ansible_ssh_pass
ansible_become
ansible_become_method
ansible_become_user
ansible_become_pass
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2707580.0x27f7a80"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Ansible Vault</b></p><p>
I also should note that although the setup is more complex, and not something
you'll likely do during your first foray into the world of Ansible,
the program does offer a way to encrypt passwords in a vault. Once
you're familiar with Ansible and you want to put it into production,
storing those passwords in an encrypted Ansible vault is ideal. But in
the spirit of learning to crawl before you walk, I recommend starting in
a non-production environment and using passwordless methods at first.
</p></div><p>
Finally, you should test your system to make sure your clients are
connecting. The ping test will make sure the Ansible computer can ping
each host:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ansible -m ping all
</pre>
</p><p>
After running, you should see a message for each defined host showing
a <tt  >ping: pong</tt> if the ping was successful. This doesn't actually test
authentication, just the network connectivity. Try this to test your
authentication:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ansible -m shell -a 'uptime' webservers
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see the results of the <tt  >uptime</tt> command for each host in the
<tt  >webservers</tt> group.
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll start to dig in to Ansible's ability to manage the
remote computers. I'll look at various modules and how you can use
the ad-hoc mode to accomplish in a few keystrokes what would take a
long time to handle individually on the command line. If you didn't
get the results you expected from the sample Ansible commands above,
take this time to make sure authentication is working. Check
