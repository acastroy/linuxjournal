<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_7">
First came branding through sponsorship. Then came eyeball-chasing
through adtech. Now comes sponsorship again, this time supporting a mission
as big as Linux. By Doc Searls</h2>

<p>This editorial is my first and only sales pitch. It's for brands to
sponsor <em>Linux Journal</em>.
</p>

<p>I'm also not just speaking as a magazine editor. I've studied advertising
from inside and out for longer than most people have been alive.</p>

<p>During my inside years, I was a founder and creative director of one of
Silicon Valley's top advertising agencies, with my name emblazoned on a
building in Palo Alto.</p>

<p>In my outside years, I've been one of the biggest opponents of adtech:
tracking-based advertising. And I've been just as big a proponent of
advertising that builds and maintains brands while sponsoring the best
journalism.</p>

<p>What we bring to the table are the smartest and most savvy tech readers in
the world, plus a mission for advertising itself: to turn away from
eyeball-chasing and back to what builds brands and sells products—but in
ways that aren't bullshit. Tall order, but it can be done.</p>

<p>Our readers can help with that, because they have the world's best
bullshit filters—and the world's best appreciation of what's real and
works. They are also influential without being what marketers call
"influencers". In fact, I'm sure most of them would hate being called
"influencers," because they know "influencer marketing" actually means "using
experts as tools".</p>

<p>Advertising that isn't bullshit starts with sponsorship. That means you
advertise in a magazine because it's valuable to the world, has readers that
are the same, and you know it will help those readers and the world know
about the goods you bring to the market's table.</p>

<p>The biggest reason our readers are valuable is that the whole tech world
runs on Linux now. They had something to do with that, and so did we.</p>

<p>Another fact: sponsors made <em>Linux Journal</em> a success no
less than our writers and other employees did.</p>

<p>Now is also the right time for brands to walk away from the disaster that
tracking-based advertising, aka adtech, has become. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General
Data Protection Regulation, aka GDPR</a>, is just one sign of it. Another is
that a $trillion or more has been spent on tracking-based ads, and not one
brand known to the world has been made by it. Many have been harmed.</p>

<p>We may be small as magazines go, but our ambitions are not. We <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/worth-saving">wish</a> to be
nothing less than the best technology magazine on Planet Earth. If you
sponsor us, you're on for that ride too.</p>
