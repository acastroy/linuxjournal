<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_35">
Python 3.7's dataclasses reduce repetition in your class definitions. By
Reuven M. Lerner</h2>

<p>
Newcomers to Python often are surprised by how little code is required
to accomplish quite a bit. Between powerful built-in data structures
that can do much of what you need, comprehensions to take care of many
tasks involving iterables, and the lack of getter and setter methods
in class definitions, it's no wonder that Python programs tend to be
shorter than those in static, compiled languages.
</p>

<p>
However, this amazement often ends when people start to define classes
in Python. True, the class definitions generally will be pretty
short. But the <code>__init__</code> method, which adds attributes to a new object,
tends to be rather verbose and repetitive—for example:

</p>
<pre><code>
class Book(object):
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Let's ignore the need for the use of <code>self</code>, which is an outgrowth of
the LEGB (local, enclosing, global, builtins) scoping rules in
Python and which isn't going away. Let's also note that there is a
world of difference between the parameters <code>title</code>,
<code>author</code> and
<code>price</code> and the attributes <code>self.title</code>,
<code>self.author</code> and
<code>self.price</code>.
</p>

<p>
What newcomers often wonder—and in the classes I teach, they often wonder
about this out loud—is why you need to make these assignments at
all. After all, can't <code>__init__</code> figure out that the three non-self
parameters are meant to be assigned to <code>self</code> as attributes? If
Python's so smart, why doesn't it do this for you?
</p>

<p>
I've given several answers to this question through the years. One is that
Python tries to make everything explicit, so you can see what's
happening. Having automatic, behind-the-scenes assignment to
attributes would violate that principal.
</p>

<p>
At a certain point, I actually came up with a half-baked solution to
this problem, although I did specifically say that it was un-Pythonic
and thus not a good candidate for a more serious implementation. In a
blog post, "Making Python's __init__ method magical", I proposed that
you could assign parameters to attributes automatically, using a
combination of inheritance and introspection. This was was a thought
experiment, not a real proposal. And yet, despite my misgivings and
the skeletal implementation, there was something attractive about not
having to write the same boilerplate <code>__init__</code> method, with the same
assignment of arguments to attributes.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to 2018. As I write this, Python 3.7 is about to be
released. And, it turns out that one of the highlights of this new
version is "dataclasses"—a way to write classes that removes the
need to write boilerplate code. The implementation was done in a much
different (and better) way than I had proposed, and it includes a great
deal of functionality I hadn't even imagined. And yet, I expect
that for many people, dataclasses will become their preferred way to
create Python classes.
</p>

<p>
So in this article, I review the new dataclasses functionality in Python
3.7. If you're reading this before 3.7 has been released, I
suggest downloading and installing it, albeit not as your main,
production version of Python, just in case issues arise before the
first production release.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_36">
Simple Dataclasses</h3>

<p>
Let's take the class from above:

</p>
<pre><code>
class Book(object):
    def __init__(self, title, author, price):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.price = price
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Here's how you can translate it into a dataclass:

</p>
<pre><code>
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Book(object):
    title : str
    author : str
    price : float
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you have any experience with Python, you can recognize the outline
of what's going on here, but a whole bunch of things
are different.
</p>

<p>
First is using the <code>dataclass</code> decorator to modify class
definition. Decorators are one of Python's most powerful tools,
allowing you to modify functions and classes both when they are defined
and when they are called. In this case, the decorator inspects the
class definition and then writes <code>__init__</code> and other methods on the
fly, based on that definition.
</p>

<p>
Next, you'll notice that no <code>__init__</code> has been defined, or any
other methods, for that matter. Instead, what is defined is what would
appear to be class attributes. But then again, they're not really
class attributes, since they lack any values. So what are they doing?
</p>

<p>
Moreover, there might not be any values associated with these class
attributes, but there are types, using the type-annotation syntax
introduced in Python 3. Type annotations allow you to tag a variable
with a particular object. The annotations aren't used or enforced by
Python, but they can be used by your editor or by external programs
(such as MyPy) to improve the accuracy of your code. You don't have to
stick with the simple built-in types either; you can use the
<code>typing</code> 
module to import a variety of predefined types, including one called
<code>Any</code> if you want to allow for anything.
</p>

<p>
So already you likely can see a few advantages to dataclasses. You don't
need to write the boilerplate code in <code>__init__</code>, and type annotations
already are included. But aside from clearer, shorter code and the
ability to run code checkers, what else do you get?
</p>

<p>
Well, it turns out that the <code>@dataclass</code> decorator doesn't just create
<code>__init__</code>. It creates a number of other methods as well. For
example, it defines <code>__eq__</code>, the method that lets you determine if two
classes are equal to one another using the <code>==</code> equality operator.
It also defines <code>__repr__</code> to be far more attractive and useful than
the existing Python default.
</p>

<p>
With the above class definition, you thus can say:

</p>
<pre><code>
b1 = Book('MyTitle1', 'AuthorFirst AuthorLast', 20)
b2 = Book('MyTitle2', 'AuthorFirst AuthorLast', 25)

print(b1)
print(b2)
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
The output will be:

</p>
<pre><code>
Book(title='MyTitle1', author='AuthorFirst AuthorLast', 
 ↪price=20)
Book(title='MyTitle2', author='AuthorFirst AuthorLast', 
 ↪price=25)
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that while the attribute names are specified in the dataclass at
the class level, the names actually are stored as attributes on the
individual instances. You can see this by exploring the new objects a
little bit. For example, if you ask to print <code>vars(b1)</code>, you get the
following:

</p>
<pre><code>
{'title': 'MyTitle1', 'author': 'AuthorFirst AuthorLast', 
 ↪'price': 20}
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
And if you ask to see the type of <code>b1.title</code>, Python tells you that it's a
string. So nothing fancy is being created here, such as a
property or a descriptor. Rather, this is just creating a regular old class,
albeit with some useful and interesting functionality.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_37">
Adding Methods</h3>

<p>
The name "dataclass" implies that such classes are to be used for
data, and only data. And indeed, part of the thinking behind the
development of dataclasses was that folks wanted something easier to
write than regular Python classes, but with the same easy-to-read
syntax as named tuples or dictionaries. The name implies that such
classes are used only for storing data, without the ability to write
methods.
</p>

<p>
But, that's not the case. You can add methods to a dataclass, just as you
would add it to any other class. For example, say you want
to get the book author's name as a list of strings, rather than as a
single string. This would be useful if you want to alphabetize or
display books by the author's last name and then first name.
</p>

<p>
In a dataclass, you add such a method by...adding the method. In the
body of the class, you would write:

</p>
<pre><code>
def author_split(self):
    return self.author.split()
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
In other words, you can create whatever methods you want, using the
same syntax that you've used before.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_38">
Optional Functionality</h3>

<p>
Dataclasses offer a great deal of functionality that can help you 
modify the default behavior.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost, you can provide each of your declared attributes
with a default value. Doing so makes them optional when you create a
new instance. For example, say you want the default book
price to be $20. You can say:

</p>
<pre><code>
@dataclass
class Book(object):
    title : str
    author : str
    price : float = 20
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Notice how the syntax reflects the Python 3 syntax for function
parameters that have both type annotation and a default value. Just as
is the case with function parameter defaults, dataclass attributes
with defaults must come after those without defaults.
</p>

<p>
Rather than declaring a value for a default, you actually can pass a
function that is executed (without any arguments) each time a new
object is created.
</p>

<p>
To do this, and to take advantage of a number of other features having
to do with dataclass attributes, you must use the <code>field</code> function
(from the <code>dataclass</code> module), which lets you tailor the way 
the attribute is defined and used.
</p>

<p>
If you pass a function to the <code>default_factory</code> parameter, that
function will be invoked each time a new instance is created without a
specified value for that attribute. This is very similar to the way
that the <code>defaultdict</code> class works, except that it can be specified
for each attribute.
</p>

<p>
For example, you can give each new book a default random price between
$20 and $100 in the following way:

</p>
<pre><code>
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

def random_price():
    return random.randint(20,100)

@dataclass
class Book(object):
    title : str
    author : str
    price : float = field(default_factory=random_price)
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Note that you cannot both set <code>default_factory</code> and a default value;
the whole point is that <code>default_factory</code> lets you run a function
and, thus, provides the value dynamically, when the new instance is created.
</p>

<p>
The main thing that the <code>__init__</code> method in a Python object does is add
attributes to the new instance. Indeed, I'd argue that the majority of
<code>__init__</code> methods I've written through the years do little more than
assigning the parameters to instance attributes. For such objects,
the default behavior of dataclasses works just fine.
</p>

<p>
But in some cases, you'll want to do more than just assign
values. Perhaps you want to set up values that aren't dependent on
parameters. Perhaps you want to take the parameters and adjust them in
some way. Or perhaps you want to do something bigger, such as open a
file or make a network connection.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the whole point of a dataclass is that it takes care of
writing <code>__init__</code> for you. And thus, if you want to do more than just
assign the parameters to attributes, you can't do so, at least not in
<code>__init__</code>. I mean, you <em>could</em> define
<code>__init__</code>, but the whole point of
a dataclass is that it does so for you.
</p>

<p>
For cases like this, dataclasses have another method at their
disposal, called <code>__post_init__</code>. If you define
<code>__post_init__</code>, it
will run after the dataclass-defined <code>__init__</code>. So, you're assured
that the attributes have been set, allowing you to adjust or add to
them, as necessary.
</p>

<p>
Here's another case that dataclasses handle. Normally, instances of
user-created classes are hashable. But in the case of dataclasses,
they aren't. This means you can't use dataclasses as keys in
dictionaries or as elements in sets.
</p>

<p>
You can get around this by declaring your class to be "frozen", making
it immutable. In other words, a frozen dataclass is defined at runtime
and then never changes—similar to a named tuple. You can do this by
giving a <code>True</code> value to the dataclass decorator's
<code>frozen</code> parameter:

</p>
<pre><code>
&gt;&gt;&gt; @dataclass(frozen=True)
... class Foo(object):
...     x : int
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; f1 = Foo(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f1.x = 100
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dataclasses.py", line 448, 
       ↪in _frozen_setattr
    raise FrozenInstanceError(f'cannot assign to field {name!r}')
dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError: cannot assign to field 'x'
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Moreover, now you can run <code>hash</code> on the variable:

</p>
<pre><code>
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(f1)
3430012387537
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
There are a number of other optional pieces of functionality in
dataclasses as well—from indicating how your objects will be
compared, which fields will be printed and the like. It's impressive
to see just how much thought has gone into the creation of
dataclasses. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next few years, most
Python classes will be defined as dataclasses, along with whatever
customization and additions the user requests.

Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Python's classes always have suffered from some repetition, and
dataclasses aim to fix that problem. But, dataclasses go beyond macros
to provide a toolkit that a large number of Python developers
can and should use to improve the readability of their code. The fact
that dataclasses integrate so nicely into other modern Python tools
and code, such as MyPy, tells me that it's going to 
become the standard way to create and work with classes in Python very
quickly.
