<h1 class="title">FOSS Project Spotlight: Pydio Cells, an Enterprise-Focused File-Sharing
Solution</h1>

<p>
Pydio Cells is a brand-new product focused on the needs of enterprises and
large organizations, brought to you from the people who launched the concept
of the open-source
file sharing and synchronization solution in 2008. The concept behind
Pydio Cells is challenging: to be to file sharing what Slack has been to
chats—that is, a revolution in terms of the number of features, power and ease of
use.
</p>

<p>
In order to reach this objective, Pydio's development team has switched
from the old-school development stack (Apache and PHP) to Google's Go
language to overcome the bottleneck represented by legacy technologies.
Today, Pydio Cells offers a faster, more scalable microservice architecture
that is in tune with dynamic modern enterprise environments.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Pydio's new "Cells" concept delivers file sharing as a
modern collaborative app. Users are free to create flexible group spaces for
sharing based on their own ways of working with dedicated in-app messaging
for improved collaboration.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the enterprise data management functionality gives both
companies and administrators reassurance, with controls and reporting that
directly answer corporate requirements around the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and other tightening data
protection regulations.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_24">
Pydio Loves DevOps</h3>

<p>
In tune with modern enterprise DevOps environments, Pydio Cells now runs as
its own application server (offering a dependency-free binary, with no need for
external libraries or runtime environments). The application is available as
a Docker image, and it offers out-of-the-box connectors for
containerized application orchestrators, such as Kubernetes.
</p>

<p>
Also, the application has been broken up into a series of logical
microservices. Within this new architecture, each service is allocated its
own storage and persistence, and can be scaled independently. This enables
you to manage and scale Pydio
more efficiently, allocating resources to each
specific service.
</p>

<p>
The move to Golang has delivered a ten-fold improvement in performance. At
the same time, by breaking the application into logical microservices, larger
users can scale the application by targeting greater resources only to the
services that require it, rather than inefficiently scaling the entire
solution.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_25">
Built on Standards</h3>

<p>
The new Pydio Cells architecture has been built with a renewed focus on the
most popular modern open standards:
</p>

<ul><li>
All files are served through a standard S3 API to allow any existing client
application built on Amazon Storage to query Pydio directly.
</li>

<li>
Pydio's own, REST API has been documented through the Linux
Foundation's Open API (previously Swagger) specification, giving
developers the ability to generate clients for the API automatically in a
wide variety of different languages.
</li>

<li>
The new native authentication within Pydio has been built on OpenID Connect,
providing safe, simple integration with existing enterprise Authentication
Servers.
</li>

<li>
Pydio Cells' internal microservice architecture uses DevOps standards,
such as GRPC, 12-Factor App methodology and Protobuf, providing compatibility
with popular developer tools.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_26">
Policy Control and Enforcement</h3>

<p>
Functionality around security policies also has been given a major upgrade,
with a focus on simplicity, practicality and control:
</p>

<ul><li>
Administrators now can assign rules to groups and individuals based on IP
addresses, location, time and other factors. Policies are managed from a
clear interface built using Google's intuitive Material Design.
</li>

<li>
Similarly, access to file metadata and API access (for external systems, apps
and services) are controlled via the same overarching policies. And with
"deny by default" access rights, administrators can be confident that
policies are enforced.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_27">
Dedicated GDPR Logs and Reporting</h3>

<p>
Because of the GDPR, the administrator
interface in Pydio Enterprise has been extensively redeveloped to deliver
clarity and control, and to simplify the task of managing data for compliance.
Pydio Cells now features GDPR-compliant logs (separated from the system
logs), giving administrators uncluttered access to all the data relevant for
data protection regulation and auditing. These logs can be filtered and
exported as spreadsheets or CSV files for external reporting.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_28">
Additional Admin Improvements</h3>


<ul><li>
A powerful new LDAP integration interface allows administrators to filter and
map existing LDAP databases to attributes in Pydio, providing clear control
for accurate schema matching. This delivers a fast, workable solution at the
LDAP data import phase, ensuring that inevitable inconsistencies and corner
cases are dealt with at source.
</li>

<li>
Versioning of documents is now controlled natively within Pydio with
intuitive graphic representation to configure retention periods. This allows
administrators to define clear policies for keeping files and versions over
time, and minimizes unnecessary wastage of storage capacity.
</li>

<li>
Pydio Cells also offers file encryption within the application, with no need
to trust the underlying storage. Administrators can export and import
encryption keys through a dedicated password-protected function.
</li>

<li>
As part of the new microservice architecture, the admin interface includes a
granular overview of all services running within Pydio. Data administrators
now can see the load on each service, monitor application performance and
alert devops to impending capacity problems.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_29">
The New End-User Experience</h3>

<p>
Pydio Cells delivers file sharing and collaboration in a way that is more
familiar, comfortable and intuitive for users of modern collaborative apps.
It lets users decide how to share files and information based on knowledge
of their own teams, workflows and working patterns. This end-user freedom
also takes the responsibility for creating effective workspaces away from
overburdened administrators.
</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. User Dashboad</p>
</div>
<p>
End users now can create their own flexible "Cells", combining files and
folders from any location. Cells provide a space for collaborating on
documents, which can be based on teams, projects or any other user-defined
topic. The Cells concept will be familiar to modern workers used to
collaborating on "channels" within popular group-chat applications.
</p>

<p>
Cells can be shared internally or externally to the organisation, with users
able to add new individuals and groups to the Cell. In-app, instant messaging
within each Cell then provides a focused channel for group communication
around the theme.
</p>

<p>
Pydio Cells is available for download from <a href="https://pydio.com">https://pydio.com</a> in two flavors:
a free community-supported version with contract options and a commercial
version with unlimited Level 3 contract support for enterprise deployments.
Pricing is available on the website.
