<h1 class="title">Open Sauce: Why the Failure to Conquer the Desktop Was Great for GNU/Linux</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_96">
AI: open source's next big win. By Glyn Moody</h2>

<p>
Canonical recently launched Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. It's an
important release. In part, that's because Canonical will
support it for five years, making it one of the relatively rare <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">LTS</a> products in Ubuntu's history.
Ubuntu 18.04 also marks a high-profile return to GNOME as the default
desktop, after a few years of controversial experimentation with Unity.
The result is regarded by many as the best desktop Ubuntu so far (that's my
view too, for what it's worth). And yet, the emphasis at launch lay elsewhere. Mark
Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical and founder of Ubuntu, said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Multi-cloud operations are the new normal. Boot-time and
performance-optimised images of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on every major public
cloud make it the fastest and most efficient OS for cloud computing,
especially for storage and compute-intensive tasks like machine
learning.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The bulk of <a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2018/04/26/ubuntu-18-04-lts-optimised-for-security-multi-cloud-containers-ai">the
official 18.04 LTS announcement</a> is about Ubuntu's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/everything-you-need-know-about-cloud-and-cloud-computing-part-i">cloud
computing</a> features. On the main web site, Ubuntu claims
to be "<a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud">The standard
OS for cloud computing</a>", citing (slightly old) research
that shows "70% of public cloud workloads and 54% of OpenStack
clouds" use it. Since Canonical is a privately held company,
it doesn't publish a detailed breakdown of its operations, just <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/06870835/filing-history">a
basic summary</a>. That means it's hard to tell just how successful
the cloud computing strategy is proving. But, the fact that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=235&amp;v=y4lF_fYxvIk">Shuttleworth
is now openly talking about an IPO</a>—not something to be undertaken
lightly—suggests that there is enough good news to convince
investors to throw plenty of money at Canonical when the prospectus
spells out how the business is doing.
</p>

<p>
It would be idle to pretend that the apparent success of Ubuntu's
cloud strategy was all part of a grand plan from the beginning.
When I interviewed Shuttleworth in 2008, he was still saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/may/22/internet.software">his
number one challenge</a> was "how to make the Linux desktop something
that you want to keep on your computer". In truth, Canonical was forced
to try something else when it became clear that GNU/Linux was never
going to take off on the desktop, despite pious hopes by many of us in
the Open Source community that "very soon" it would be the Year of the
GNU/Linux Desktop. What little demand there was for open source on PCs
was probably mopped up by Red Hat, which had been one of the very first
companies to serve the sector. Good as Ubuntu was, it didn't offer
enough to break Microsoft's stranglehold on the mainstream desktop.
</p>

<p>
And so Canonical has moved ever deeper into the cloud. Although that
change of emphasis may have been born of necessity, when its other
products failed to catch on in a big way, the Canonical management
soon turned it into a virtue. By dint of spotting and adopting rising
open-source stars in the cloud computing world—projects like <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a> and more recently, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>—Canonical has positioned
Ubuntu as one of the most popular operating systems for cloud deployment,
a major if little known achievement outside specialist circles.
</p>

<p>
Validation for putting the cloud at the heart of its
business has just come from an unusual quarter. Microsoft's CEO
Satya Nadella recently wrote a letter to all his employees, titled "<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/03/29/satya-nadella-email-to-employees-embracing-our-future-intelligent-cloud-and-intelligent-edge">Embracing
our future: Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge</a>". Like Canonical,
but somewhat belatedly, Microsoft too is betting the company on its
cloud offering—in this case, Microsoft Azure. That has an interesting
implication for Windows, as Nadella explained:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Azure: Jason Zander is being promoted to executive vice
president, Azure, and will lead this team. The Windows platform team
led by Harv Bhela, Henry Sanders and Michael Fortin will join Jason's
team. Windows platform is already a core part of Azure across both the
cloud and edge, and this shift will enable us to accelerate our efforts
to build a unified distributed computing infrastructure and application
model.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The main Windows technology is now simply one aspect of Microsoft's
larger cloud computing offering Azure. Meanwhile, the upper layers
of Windows are being shunted off to become a minor part of a new team
called Experiences &amp; Devices. In dismantling the Windows division,
Nadella is recognizing reality. The original plan was to have <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/microsoft-wants-windows-10-everywhere-1292468">one
billion devices running Windows 10</a> in 2018.
There's not much hope of that. At the end of 2017, it had <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-reach-600m-first-time-ceo-satya-nadella-says/">only
just hit 600 million devices</a> worldwide. Although
Windows is not dying, it is clearly running out of steam, just <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/pc-market-to-slump-in-2018-but-hybrids-like-microsoft-surface-remain-a-bright-spot">like
the PC platform itself</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nadella rightly sees future growth for the company coming from elsewhere.
But, now it's clearly Microsoft that is "chasing tail lights" as the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/halloween1.html">first Halloween
Document</a> famously claimed was the case for open source. Having failed
in the mobile space, Microsoft is trying to catch up with companies like
Canonical and Red Hat in cloud computing. That's a tall order, since open
source is firmly established as the <a href="https://www.cncf.io">de
facto standard for clouds</a>, and there's nothing that Microsoft 
really can offer as a unique selling point to dislodge it—compatibility
with Windows doesn't cut it anymore.
</p>

<p>
The situation for the other growth area identified by Nadella—that is,
AI—is likely to be the same as for cloud computing. Although it is
true that AI is still a young market, without clear leaders, it seems
reasonable to assume that open source will take over here just as
it did in another market with which it shares many characteristics:
supercomputing. Today, the top 500 most powerful computers in the
world <a href="https://www.top500.org/statistics/sublist">all run
some variety of Linux</a>. The reasons are the obvious ones: complete
customisability, established reliability, low cost and the fact that
everyone is already using open source for everything else—except on
the by-now fading desktop.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu 18.04 aims to be ready for this
opportunity. Canonical says the new version is
optimized for AI, thanks to an open-source project called <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/12/introducing-kubeflow-composable">Kubeflow</a>:
"A Composable, Portable, Scalable [Machine Learning] Stack Built for
Kubernetes". David Aronchick, Product Manager, Cloud AI at Google,
is quoted by Canonical as saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
With the release of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Canonical's
collaborations to the Kubeflow project, Canonical has provided
both a familiar and highly performant operating system that works
everywhere. Whether on-premises or in the cloud, software engineers and
data scientists can use tools they are already familiar with, such as
Ubuntu, Kubernetes and Kubeflow, and greatly accelerate their ability
to deliver value for their customers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Discounting the marketing hyperbole typical of such statements made
to support the launch of new products, Aronchick makes two important
points. First, that Canonical's approach is highly portable: the models
and inference engines that are generated using input data running on
Ubuntu-based research and development systems can be deployed to devices
running Ubuntu at the edge of the network, "creating a perfect pipeline
for machine learning from workstation, to rack, to cloud and device".
Secondly, thanks to Canonical's long investment in cloud computing tools,
it is relatively easy to move into the currently fashionable area of AI
without needing to acquire a huge range of new technical skills.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu seems well placed to establish itself as a major player in
AI, which many see as not just the next big application, but as an
entirely new era for computing. Canonical laid the foundations for
that possibility when it decided to shift its emphasis to the cloud a
few years back. And that happened thanks to the perennial failure of
GNU/Linux to establish itself on the desktop, which may well turn out in
the long run to be one of the best things ever to have happened to open source.
