<h1 class="title">Take Your Git In-House</h1>


<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_69">
If you're wary of the Microsoft takeover of GitHub, or if you've been
looking for a way to ween yourself off free public repositories, or if you want
to ramp up your DevOps efforts, now's a good time to look at installing
and running GitLab yourself. It's not as difficult as you might think,
and the free, open-source GitLab CE version provides a lot of flexibility to
start from scratch, migrate or graduate to more full-fledged versions. By
John S. Tonello
</h2>

<p>
In today's software business, getting solid code out the door fast is a
must, and practices to make that easier are part of any organization's
DevOps toolset. Git has risen to the top of the heap of version control
tools, because it's simple, fast and makes collaboration easy. 
</p>

<p>
For developers, tools like Git ensure that their code isn't just
backed up and made available to others, but nearly guarantees that it can be
incorporated into a wide variety of third-party development tools—from
Jenkins to Visual Studio—that make continuous integration and
continuous delivery (CI/CD) possible. Orchestration, automation and
deployment tools easily integrate with Git as well, which means code developed
on any laptop or workstation anywhere can be merged, branched and integrated
into deployed software. That's why version control repositories are the
future of software development and DevOps, no matter how big or small you
are, and no matter whether you're building monolithic apps or
containerized ones.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_70">
Getting Started with Git</h3>

<p>
Git works by taking snapshots of code on every commit, so every version of
contributed code is always available. That means it's easy to roll back
changes or look over different contributors' work.
</p>

<p>
If you're working in an environment that uses Git, you can do your work
even when you're offline. Everything is saved in a project structure on
your workstation, just as it is in the remote Git repository, and when
you're next online, your commits and pushes update the master (or other)
code branch quickly and easily. 
</p>

<p>
Most Git users (even newbies) use the Git command-line tools to clone, commit
and push changes, because it's easy, and for nearly 28-million developers,
GitHub has become the de facto remote Git-based repository for their work. In
fact, GitHub has moved beyond being just a code repository to become a
multifaceted code community featuring 85-million projects. That's a lot
of code.
</p>

<p>
GitLab is gaining popularity as a remote code repository too, but it's
smaller and bills itself as more DevOps-focused, with CI/CD tool included
for free. Both repositories offer free hosted accounts that allow users to
create a namespace, and start contributing and collaborating right away. 
The graphical browser interfaces offered by the GitHub- and GitLab-hosted
services make it easy to manage projects and project code, and also to add
SSH keys, so
you easily can connect from your remote terminal on Linux, Windows or Mac.
</p>

<p>
To become familiar with how Git works, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">install the latest
package</a> on your workstation, sign up for a
free account on GitHub or GitLab and start experimenting:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt install git
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
If you're a GitHub pro, you can speed ahead and start thinking about a
couple projects you have that you'd like to import into GitLab.
That'll give you a bit of a head start when you're ready to start
building out your on-premises GitLab deployment.
</p>


<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_71">
GitHub vs. GitLab</h3>

<p>
With Git at their core, GitHub and GitLab have more in common than not,
although GitLab is more generous with private repositories for its free
version. The folks over at UserSnap did a nice job of summarizing the
differences in a recent post. Check the Resources section at the end of this
article to learn more.
</p>

<p>
For this how-to, you'll be deploying GitLab CE omnibus, a full-featured
and free version of GitLab. If you've used the free online version at
<a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab.com</a>, it will look familiar to you. If
you've used only GitHub and
want to get a taste for GitLab CE before you deploy it locally, try the
online version of GitLab to get a feel for the differences.
</p>

<p>
One more thing to think about if you're considering doing a full
migration away from GitHub: check to see how any third-party apps you use
integrate with GitLab. Since it's all Git under the covers, chances are
good that GitLab will integrate as easily as GitHub, but it doesn't hurt to
check. If you still have doubts, check the Resources section for
GitLab's application integration list.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_72">
Ways to Install and Deploy GitLab</h3>

<p>
This tutorial is about deploying GitLab CE on-premises, but in this day and
age,
there's certainly more than one way to do that. For example, you can
install GitLab on a fresh Linux VM of your choice, which is what I describe
in this how-two, but you also can deploy it from a ready-made virtual
machine .ova, a Turnkey template, an official Docker image or from a Helm
repository for Kubernetes. If "in-house" means the public cloud for
you, GitLab also offers options for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform and
Mesosphere deployments.
</p>

<p>
And, in case that's not enough, there also are ways to automate the deployment
using tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Juju, Vagrant and more. 
For this tutorial, I describe deploying on an Ubuntu 16.04 VM, but most of
the instructions easily can be adapted to Debian, CentOS, OpenSUSE and even
Raspbian for the RPi. GitLab offers specific instructions for most modern
flavors of Linux, including the Raspberry Pi.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_73">
Deploy GitLab CE</h3>

<p>
Before you begin your GitLab deployment, put some thought into how you'll
use it. If you're noodling around in a home lab, you easily can get by
with a relatively small VM with modest storage. If you're looking at
something a little more robust, give some thought to drive capacity and DNS.
GitLab stores information in a database and does it efficiently, but if
you're going to have hundreds of developers and hundreds of projects,
think about how the underlying database will grow over time.
</p>

<p>
If you're deploying into a production setting, it goes without saying
that you need to build in some sort of disaster recovery and business
continuity capabilities. After all, this is a standalone deployment. If
you're planning something really big, treat it as you would any core
service that needs protecting.
</p>

<p>
With that said, GitLab doesn't take many resources to run, and it can be
readily scaled to 32,000 users on a single application server.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_74">
CPU</h3>

<p>
GitLab recommends system requirements based on the size of your deployment,
with one core supporting up to 100 users, though GitLab admits you'll
experience slowness, which I can confirm. It's better to commit the recommended
minimum two cores for starters. That will support up to 500 users and adds
snappiness to the GUI and the GitLab services.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_75">
Memory</h3>

<p>
GitLab recommends 4GB of RAM for installations handling up to 100 users. I
tested 2GB and 3GB—options that are possible—but
performance suffered. Will it work with less memory? Yes, and it might be
just fine if you rarely use the browser interface and rely instead on doing
most of your work remotely from the command line. If your VM host is truly
hurting for memory, I recommend starting with 2GB and going from there.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_76">
Database</h3>

<p>
If you're starting your installation with two cores and 4GB of RAM, you
can get away with committing at little as 10GB of storage for the GitLab
installation and database. I set up my VM with 16GB, which worked fine.
</p>

<p>
By default, the GitLab installation will deploy PostgreSQL as the underlying
database, which is highly recommended over MySQL and MariaDB, because those
databases don't support all of GitLab's features. You can make it work
if you must, but it's better to go with PostgreSQL.
</p>

<p>
In the end, my GitLab deployment ended up sipping resources, and the VM
resources looked like Figure 1 when it was running.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="GitLab Screen" src="12469f1.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 1. GitLab Running on an Ubuntu 16.04 VM with Minimal CPU, Memory and Storage</p>
</div>
<p>
Note that when it's idle, GitLab is using hardly any CPU. When I ran a
remote push, it barely moved CPU usage past 5%.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I finished my prep by adding an entry for my GitLab host on my DNS
servers so I could set the <code>external_url</code> config parameter during
installation and more easily access the host when cloning and pushing
projects. You probably can get away with editing the /etc/hosts file on
both your GitLab host and workstation instead of a full-fledged DNS setup
(and if you don't want to use the OAuth integration described later).
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_77">
Installation Details</h3>

<p>
Installing GitLab CE took only three steps. The first was to ensure
<code>curl</code>,
<code>openssh-server</code> and <code>ca-certificates</code> were installed on the Ubuntu host:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Your GitLab server can send email if you install <code>postfix</code>, or you can skip
that step and configure an external SMTP server later.
</p>

<p>
The next step is adding the GitLab package repository to the Ubuntu
<code>apt</code>
sources, which is made easy with a bash script GitLab supplies:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ curl -sS
https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/
 ↪gitlab-ce/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
For Ubuntu 16.04, it added the following sources if you feel like adding them
manually:

</p>
<pre><code>
deb https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce/ubuntu/ 
 ↪xenial main
deb-src https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ce/ubuntu/ 
 ↪xenial main
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
With the package sources in place and updated, installation is done with a
routine <code>apt</code> command that includes the URL of your GitLab host added as a
parameter:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo EXTERNAL_URL="http://gitlab.example.com" apt-get 
 ↪install gitlab-ce
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Be sure to set this to the URL of your host. If you want to use HTTPS, you
can do that, but you'll need to complete a couple more steps after the
main installation. See the Resources section on how to do that with a
self-signed certificate or with one supplied by a Certificate Authority.
The total installation process takes just a few minutes and leaves you with a
fully functioning GitLab server ready to go at the URL you specified.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Ad Choices Symbol" src="12469f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. After installation, GitLab will be available at the URL you set. You'll see a password reset screen and then be taken to the main login page. Log in initially with the user name "root".</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_78">
Set Up a User and SSH Keys</h3>

<p>
The first thing I did after logging in as "root" was to go into the
admin settings (reachable from the little wrench icon in the main nav bar)
and create a user account. I gave it the same name as my GitHub account for
consistency and to make it easier to sync GitHub and GitLab repositories
later. Once the new user was created, I logged out and logged back in with
that account.
</p>

<p>
As with GitHub, you'll need to set up at least one SSH key to enable you
to establish a secure connection between your workstation and your GitLab
server. In the GitLab console, navigate to Settings and SSH Keys; the console
shows you where to find your existing keys or how to create one, and warns
you to paste in only the .pub part. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="GitLab Screen" src="12469f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. GitLab offers nice in-line hints on how to create your SSH keys.</p>
</div>

<p>
GitLab does a great job throughout of offering in-line instructions and tips,
making it particularly easy to set up, even if you're brand new to Git
and GitLab. For instance, if you start trying to create projects without
first setting up at least one SSH key, GitLab warns you right in the console.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="GitLab" src="12469f4.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. If you try to create a project without first setting up at least one SSH key, GitLab will warn you and link you to where you need to go.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_79">
Import GitHub Projects</h3>

<p>
If you're deploying GitLab with an intent to replace GitHub (or another
public code repository), GitLab makes it straightforward by providing hooks
right within the project-creation tooling. 
</p>

<p>
GitLab offers two ways to set up integrations with GitHub: you can set up an
OAuth application or use a Personal Access Token. GitLab recommends the OAuth
method, because it associates all user activity on GitHub repositories with
those on your self-hosted GitLab repositories. It's a nice integration
that makes for a seamless transition. Using the Personal Access Token method
is easier, but it doesn't give you all the bells and whistles.
</p>

<p>
GitLab also recommended using the same namespace (user name) in both services.
So in my case, I created a GitLab account user name "jtonello" to
match my GitHub one.
</p>

<p>
To start the integration, log in to your GitHub account, and navigate to
Settings and Developer Settings. In the menu, choose OAuth Apps and click the
"New OAuth App" button.
</p>

<p>
Here you'll provide some basic information, including an application name
and the full URL to your GitLab application home page. Critical among these
is the Authorization callback URL, which must be an address GitHub can reach.
This is where setting up a fully qualified domain name on your GitLab server
comes in handy. If you're working in a home lab on a NATed network, set
up your router to forward port 80 or 443 to your GitLab server. In this way,
you can use the WAN IP address of your router as your callback URL. I used my
router's DDNS feature with No-IP to do this with a ddns.net domain name
GitHub could see and communicate with.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="New OAuth screen" src="12469f5.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 5. When creating a new OAuth application in GitHub, make sure the Authorization callback URL matches that of your GitLab server and that it's accessible.</p>
</div>

<p>
When you click the "Register application" button, you'll be taken
to GitHub's OAuth application page, which shows a new Client ID and
Client Secret for the application you just created. You'll use these to
complete the setup back on your GitLab host. Don't share them.
They're keys to your GitHub repository!
</p>

<p>
Back on your GitLab CE omnibus host, open /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb, the main
GitLab configuration file, and add the GitHub provider details you just
created:

</p>
<pre><code>
gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
  {
    "name" =&gt; "github",
    "app_id" =&gt; "YOUR_APP_ID",
    "app_secret" =&gt; "YOUR_APP_SECRET",
    "args" =&gt; { "scope" =&gt; "user:email" }
  }
]
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
You'll also need to make a few changes in /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb for the
initial OmniAuth Configuration. In the omnibus version, uncomment and edit
the following lines to look like this:

</p>
<pre><code>
gitlab_rails['omniauth_enabled'] = true
gitlab_rails['omniauth_allow_single_sign_on'] = ['saml', 
 ↪'twitter']
gitlab_rails['omniauth_auto_link_ldap_user'] = true
gitlab_rails['omniauth_block_auto_created_users'] = true
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Once you save the file, you'll need to reconfigure your GitLab server, a
step that automatically restarts the various GitLab services:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Although the <code>reconfigure</code> command takes only a moment (you'll see activity
scrolling by on your terminal), be patient for the GitLab services to
restart. It may take a minute or two. 
</p>

<p>
When the services are back up, go to the GitLab login page where you'll
now see a GitHub login option. If all went well, you now can create a new
project and import repositories directly from GitHub.
</p>

<p>
Do this by clicking the "New project" button on the GitLab
Projects page and choosing "GitHub" from the list on the "Import
project" tab. The first time you do this, you'll be prompted to
authorize the OAuth connection with GitHub, and then you'll see a "List your
GitHub repositories" button. If you've decided instead to use a
Personal Access Token to create your link to GitHub, you'll see that
here too.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="GitHub Import" src="12469f6.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. Successful setup of the OAuth integration enables a direct view of GitHub repositories from within GitLab.</p>
</div>
<p>
You'll know the authorization is successful if you see the import page,
and you'll likely get an obligatory email from GitHub telling you that a
third-party OAuth application has been added to you account.
</p>

<p>
You now can choose to import some or all of your GitHub repositories. You can
save them to your current user account or select another. Depending on the
size of the repository and your network speed, this will take anywhere from a
few seconds to a few minutes.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="GitHub Import" src="12469f7.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 7. This view inside GitLab shows a complete list of your GitHub projects, which can be imported as is under the current user or a different GitLab user, or it can be renamed.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_80">
Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>
With GitLab up and running, go ahead and try to create some new projects or
clone existing ones to your workstation. GitLab even shows you the commands
to run (Figure 8).
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="GitLab Screen" src="12469f8.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. When you create a new project in GitLab, it offers basic Git instructions on how to get started.</p>
