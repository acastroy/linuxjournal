Kyle Rankin's RV TV and Disc Encryption</h3>

<p>
To Kyle Rankin: great article on your RVTV
setup in the June issue! Encrypting the hard drive sounds like a good idea to
protect against the real chance of burglary, but I somehow missed the
decrypting part. It seems like you're setting up a keyfile (on the Raspberry
Pi's SD card I guess) for that, but isn't that just hiding the key under the
doormat, revealing the drive's content to a committed thief stealing the
entire system?
</p>

<p>
—Mike Schilli
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kyle Rankin replies:</strong> Great question, and I'm glad you caught the risk with
using a key file!
</p>

<p>
Yes, using a keyfile is not my standard practice—I prefer requiring a
passphrase at boot—but in this case, I wasn't going to sit (or worse, make
my family sit) in front of a keyboard to type in a passphrase each time
we turned on the TV. I needed to balance security with how this system
was intended to be used and who was going to use it.
</p>

<p>
My threat model in this case is more car thief than hacker or spy. With
that in mind, I figured this was a fair compromise so that the media center
is available for my family to use just by turning it on, but if someone
takes the standalone hard drive and tries to plug it in to a computer, all
of the files aren't immediately available. In that case, the thief is more
likely just to format the drive. What's even more likely though is that
because the
hard drive is hidden away in a cabinet to keep it out of the way,
the thief would unmount the TV, unplug all the wires, and take that. Or
just take the whole RV—it <em>is</em> pretty sweet after all.

What the GDPR Will Do and What It Won't Do</h3>

<p>
Glyn Moody's <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/gdpr-takes-open-source-next-level">article
about the GDPR</a> has a small but significant error
when it says that ChromeOS is a free operating system. In fact, it is
proprietary, and it contains known malicious functionalities (see
<a href="https://gnu.org/malware/malware-google.html">"Google's Software Is
Malware"</a>). Users can't correct
them because the code is nonfree.
</p>

<p>
That detail doesn't affect the overall point of the article. However,
it is necessary to distinguish two different ways a service can
mistreat users:
</p>

<ul><li>
It can misuse their data.
</li>

<li>
It can deny them control of their own computing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Both of these issues are important, but they are completely different.
</p>

<p>
A service can misuse users' data if it has their data. That problem
is easy to understand. I don't give websites data about me—normally not even my name or email address. If they require an
account, I usually don't use them, with the exception of posting
comments on articles.
</p>

<p>
The other problem requires some thought to recognize at all. It is
the problem of SaaSS (Service as a Software Substitute): if someone
else's server does a computing job for you, you don't control how it
does that job, or what job it does. It follows that entrusting your
computing job to someone else's server is roughly equivalent to
running a nonfree program. For your freedom, you should reject both.
For more explanation, see
<a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">"Who
does that server really serve?"</a>.
</p>

<p>
The EU's GDPR tries to reduce the misuse of people's data. I think it
does some good, but not enough to make people in the EU safe from
misuse. See
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/03/facebook-abusing-data-law-privacy-big-tech-surveillance">"A
radical proposal to keep your personal data safe"</a>.
</p>

<p>
In particular, when governments (such as the US or France) seize databases of commercial surveillance data, the GDPR does not apply to the
governments' copies. It does no good about this danger except in
those cases (and I suppose there are some) when it convinces companies
not to collect certain data. But the limit it places on data
collection is not very strict, so it isn't likely to do that often.
</p>

<p>
However, the GDPR makes no effort to tackle the problem of SaaSS.
That was not one of its goals.
</p>

<p>
—Dr Richard Stallman
</p>

<p>
<strong>Glyn Moody replies:</strong> Richard Stallman writes:
"when governments (such as the US or France) seize databases of
commercial surveillance data, the GDPR does not apply to the
governments' copies."
</p>

<p>
It is true that the GDPR offers no protection against the French
government seizing databases, because that is not its job. It is
designed to regulate how businesses and organizations handle personal
data in the course of everyday transactions—not to limit government
actions.
</p>

<p>
However, an earlier Data Protection Directive does provide some
protection against any government outside the EU, including the US.
The personal data of EU citizens can only flow outside the EU to
countries deemed to offer an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">"adequate
level of data protection"</a>.
</p>

<p>
The US has already lost its adequacy status once after a <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150117en.pdf">ruling by the
EU's highest court against the "Safe Harbour" framework</a> that covered
transatlantic data transfers.
</p>

<p>
Adequacy was regained with the replacement scheme, <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">"Privacy Shield"</a>.
However, that, too, is being
<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180413/07033939620/bad-news-privacy-shield-as-expected-eus-top-court-will-examine-legality-sending-personal-data-to-us.shtml">challenged
in the EU courts</a>,
and may also be struck down.
</p>

<p>
Seizures of databases containing EU citizens' personal data would make
it much more likely that adequacy was withdrawn again. EU personal
data cannot be legally transferred to any country without adequacy,
and so this threat provides something of a deterrent to this kind of
action, at least to rational governments.

In Response to the Letter from Gnat in the June 2018 Issue</h3>

Doc Searls' <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/how-wizards-and-muggles-break-free-matrix">"How

<p>

I'm sure that Microsoft's 500.000 dollars for their platinum membership every month has absolutely nothing to do with it.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Simon Gramstrup:</strong> It's hard to boycott GitHub if projects stay, but if more knew of similar projects from open sites, these projects
(and sites) would get a little more exposure and grow.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of an "open source project" search engine, that searches all the smaller alternatives? I looked at Searx (from
GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/searx">https://github.com/asciimoo/searx</a>). They have a nice pluggable architecture,
but only cover GitLab from Linux Journal's
compilation (and I don't know how to make my own).
