<h1 class="title">Atomic Modeling with GAMGI</h1>


<p>
For this article, I'm moving back into the realm of chemistry
software—specifically, the General Atomistic Modelling
Graphic Interface, or <a href="http://www.gamgi.org">GAMGI</a>. GAMGI
provides a very complete set of tools that allows you
to design and visualize fairly complex molecules. 
</p>

<p>
GAMGI has the special ability to make creating repeating
structures much easier, which is handy when you're trying to create
crystalline structures. 
</p>

<p>
GAMGI should be available in the package repositories
of most Linux distributions. For example, on Debian-based distros, you can
install GAMGI with the following command:

</p>
<pre><code>
sudo apt-get install gamgi
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
There are also data and documentation packages (gamgi-data and
gamgi-doc), and when you first start to use GAMGI, it's a good
idea to install those packages as well.
</p>

<p>
Once the packages are installed, you can start GAMGI from the
command line or from your desktop environment's menu system. When it
starts up, you get a blank canvas to begin your work. 
</p>
<div class="caption">

<p class="caption">Figure 1: When you start GAMGI, you get a minimal set of tools to help begin your project.</p>
</div>
<p>
This
interface is probably one of the more minimal ones of the chemistry
packages that you are likely to use, but it hides all of the
functionality that is present within GAMGI. It is object-oriented, in
that all of the main elements are treated as independent objects, with
properties and relationships to other objects. These elements include
atoms, bonds, molecules and crystal planes. Each of them are built up
of a number of the earlier ones. One extra piece that GAMGI has is the
ability to work with orbitals. Let's walk through an example of a salt
crystal (NaCl) to show how you can use GAMGI to do graphical analysis.
</p>

<p>
When looking at a crystalline structure, you'll want to start
by creating a cell in the window. You do this by clicking the 
Cell→Create menu item. Then you'll get a pop-up window where you can
set several properties of the new cell. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Cell Create" src="12468f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. When you create a new cell for crystal structures, you can set several different properties on how it will be constructed.</p>
</div>
<p>

Since salt is a cubic crystal,
you'll want to set the system value to c (for cubic), and set the lattice
value to F (for face-centered). For each of these, you
can get a full set of allowed values by clicking the associated "List"
button. Clicking
Ok creates the cell. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Window 1 Cell" src="12468f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Creating a new cell will draw the specified structure in the main window.</p>
</div>
<p>
The next step is to start
populating it with atoms. Click 
Atom→Create, which will pop up a new window where you can set all
the properties of the new atom. 
</p>

<div class="caption">
<img alt="Atom Create" src="12468f4.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. You can select which element your atom should be, along with several other properties. </p>
</div>
<p>
Clicking the Table button
pops up a periodic table where you can select an element. This
populates all the known values to give you a starting point. Select
the View tab of the pop-up window, and change the style to solid,
the size to 1.0 and the variancy to 1.0. Next, click the Property tab to
change the size value. This is because the sodium
atom is ionized, so it's physically a different size. 
</p>

<p>
Once everything
is set correctly, you can click in the window to create your sodium
atom. You can repeat this process to create the chlorine atom. You'll
also need to change the radius to 1.810, since the chlorine atom is also
ionized. Then link these atoms to the crystal cell so that GAMGI
knows how to lay out the given atoms. Clicking Cell→Link
pops up a window where you can link in the atoms associated to this
cell. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Cell Link" src="12468f5.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 5. For crystalline structures, you need to link the related atoms to the cell to show their relationships.</p>
</div>
<p>
In this case, you'll want to change the linking
method to crystal. Next click the cell and then the
sodium atom. The relevant fields in the pop-up window will become populated
with the associated values. Now you can tell GAMGI where these sodium atoms
are supposed to be by clicking the Position tab and changing the X
value to 0.5. When you click OK, GAMGI will populate the crystal
cell with the required sodium atoms. Next, repeat this process
for the chlorine atoms, except leave the position as 0.0 for all
three coordinates.
</p>

<p>
At this point, the displayed crystal structure is not very clear. You
need to add a light source so that GAMGI can do a proper rendering of the
crystal. Click Light→Create to pop up a window where
you can define what kind of light source you want to use in the rendering
process. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Light Create" src="12468f6.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. To do a proper rendering of your molecular structure, you'll need to set up one more more light sources.</p>
</div>
<p>
Now that you've finished your crystal, you can
do some analysis work on it. Click Atom→Measure
to get a new window where you can use GAMGI to do some calculations
based on the resultant structure. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Atom Measure" src="12468f7.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 7. You can get measurements of the molecule you created, such as bond lengths and angles.</p>
</div>
<p>
With the window open,
click on two atoms and see the distance between them. Clicking
the Angle tab lets you click on three atoms and find the angle
between them. In this case, the distance between neighboring sodium
and chlorine atoms is 2.8300, while the angle formed at the corners of
the crystal is 90.00 degrees.
</p>

<p>
Other options are available. For example, if you click
Molecule→Create, you'll get a window where you can
create entire molecules. 
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Molecule Create" src="12468f8.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. You can create more complicated molecules, such as graphene</p>
</div>
<p>
Let's go ahead
and create a graphene cage. First, you get a ball of carbon
atoms. You can see the ball's properties by clicking 
Molecule→Measure. Once the window pops up, click the
molecule to see a list of all of the bonds, angles and torsions. Then
you also can modify the individual atoms. Clicking
Atom→Modify pops up a window, and if you then click on an atom, you
can modify it to something else, such as silicon. This changes the
relevant bonds in that area, so it changes the entire geometry. Now, when
you open up the Molecule Measure window, it will reflect those changes.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="window 2" src="12468f9.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 9. More complex molecules are displayed as a wire-frame by default.</p>
</div>
<p>
Hopefully, this gives you a taste of what you can do with GAMGI. One
of the more unique features is that it actually does the angle and
distance calculations based on the ionic state of the atoms involved. In
this sense, it is a more scientifically-based chemistry imaging program.
