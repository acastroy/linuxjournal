<h1 class="title">Road to RHCA—Preparation Meets Opportunity</h1>

<p>
This article is the second in my series "Road to RHCA", where I'm
charting my journey to the Red Hat Certified Architect designation—a
designation that's difficult to come by.
As an advocate and enthusiast of Linux and open
source, and more important, as someone who works as a Linux professional, I
am eager to change the current state of affairs around the number of
women and people of color who know Linux and open source, study Linux and
work in the Linux and/or open-source space.
</p>

<p>
Things haven't changed much in general when it comes to the
numbers of women and people of color who enter the IT field, but those
numbers drop significantly when it comes to Linux and open source.
It's my goal to convince other women and people of color to
study Linux and pursue open-source projects, because diversity of thought is
invaluable in the world and in the enterprise. This world is not
homogeneous; nothing else ever
should be either. 
So I'd like to see
more professionals who look like me in Linux and the Open Source community,
and I'm starting
to see a few, but there's still more work to be done.
</p>

<p>
Joining the RHCA ranks requires significant time and effort. Nothing
worth anything comes easy, nor should it, but I can say with work, family,
mentoring and now writing a book for Packt publishing, finding time
to study will be more and more difficult for me, but it's my highest priority.
At the time of this
writing, I am five exams away.
</p>

<p>	
You can choose from five areas of concentration, or you can
select any combination of eligible Red Hat certifications to create a custom
concentration. Those five concentrations are:
</p>

<ul><li>
Data Center
</li>

<li>
DevOps
</li>

<li>
Application Platform
</li>

<li>
Cloud
</li>

<li>
Application Development
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I decided the best route to my RHCA is for me to customize my
concentration to include these five certifications in the order I plan to
take them:
</p>

<ol><li>
Red Hat-Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation
</li>

<li>
Red Hat-Certified Specialist in High Availability Clustering
</li>

<li>
Red Hat-Certified Specialist in Red Hat OpenStack 
</li>

<li>
Red Hat-Certified Specialist in Linux Diagnostics and Troubleshooting
</li>

<li>
Red Hat-Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration
</li>
</ol>

<p>  
If you ask Red Hat the company, it obviously would recommend paying for
and using one of its subscription options. The
standard option costs $5,500, and the basic option costs $7,000.
Having
the subscription definitely would be beneficial, especially if you are working toward an
RHCA, but it's not something that everyone can afford.
You
might be able to get your employer to cover the costs, but that's not always
possible. So how does one without such resources become an RHCA? True grit, determination and a little creativity.
</p>

<p>  
I did some research and talked to one of my mentors, and I was
given an opportunity through sponsorship to take the EX407, which is the Red
Hat-Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation training and exam. I am now
scheduled to take the EX407 on July 31st. 
</p>

<p>
I don't want lack of money to be
the reason others don't pursue the Red Hat certifications. Things are
changing,
and virtual training platforms are beginning to offer some of
the courses that are required to obtain the RHCSA, RHCE and even the RHCA.
At this point in time, there are two that I recommend, although likely more
will continue to crop up. 
</p>

<p>
One is <a href="https://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly Books Media</a>.
I pay a monthly fee
of $39, but with all the available resources, it's a worthwhile
investment.
Sander van Vugt, a renowned Linux expert, has courses that will satisfy the RHCA, such as
Red Hat EX436 ("Linux High Availability"), EX442 ("Linux Performance
Optimization"), Ex413 ("Red Hat Certificate of Expertise in Server
Hardening")
and the OpenStack certification. This isn't an exhaustive
offering of the exams that Red Hat offers, but it's a start. If one of
these courses is on your list, you could utilize it while saving up
for the standard Red Hat subscription.
</p>

<p>
Another option is <a href="https://linuxacademy.com">Linux Academy</a>, which costs me 
$49 per month (it used to be $29 per month). Linux Academy currently offers the Ex280 exam
preparation course,
"Red Hat Certified Specialist in Platform-as-a-Service (OpenShift)". It
also has a learning path called "Red Hat Certified Architect RHCA: DevOps". The path
is not yet complete, but it currently has the EX407, which is the 
course I am taking presently (the Red Hat Certified Specialist in Ansible Automation
prep course). Its two other offerings are the "Red Hat-Certified Specialist in
Containerized Application Development" (EX276) and the "Red Hat-Certified
Specialist in Platform-as-a-Service (EX280)".
</p>

<p>
I say all of this because it's important to understand that there's more than one
way, one road, one option or one opportunity. I wish Red Hat offered more
payment options for its subscriptions, but at this time, it doesn't.
Pursuing a career in Linux and open source should not be inconceivable or
unthinkable. Women and people of color always have had to be
resourceful and tenacious, and unfortunately, there isn't always a lot of
thought put into how to attract us and keep our attention. 
</p>

<p>
I titled this article "Preparation Meets Opportunity" because I
wanted to explore the variety of opportunities that have become available and
that will continue to become available to obtain the RHCSA, RHCE and RHCA. There
isn't only one way, just as there isn't only one way of learning, one way of
tackling a challenge, and more important, one way to prepare yourself for
the opportunities that you seek. Do your research, talk to others in the
industry, and understand that while the numbers are small when it comes to
women and people of color in the technology field, and even smaller in Linux
and open source, with hard work, focus, shutting out negative
thoughts, preparation and finding the right opportunities, there
is nothing you can't overcome and nothing you can't achieve. 
</p>

<p>	
In my next article, I plan to explore why I've chosen the five exams
mentioned above, what my study habits
are like, 
time-management challenges and what the EX407 exam is all about.
Until then, in the words of Oprah
Winfrey, "I believe luck is preparation meeting opportunity. If you
hadn't been prepared when the opportunity came along, you wouldn't
have been lucky."
