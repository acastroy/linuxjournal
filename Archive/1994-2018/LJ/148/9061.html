Start with the ultimate AMD64 motherboard and build on it to create a
masterpiece of your own.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140b2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Some of us just like to do it ourselves.  There's something uniquely
satisfying about selecting every component in a system.  It allows you
to balance the exact price/performance trade-off that suits you best.
Do-it-yourself is also one of the best ways to ensure that you have
a system that won't become obsolete within six months.  For example,
most AMD64 motherboards support only 4GB of RAM, but our favorite board
supports up to 8GB of RAM.  We may never upgrade it to the full 8GB,
but it's nice to have that room for expansion.  You may not get that
kind of room for expansion with a pre-made system.
</p><p>
For those with little patience, we'll get right to the bottom line.
Our favorite do-it-yourself combo includes the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Motherboard: ABIT AN8 32X 939
</p></li><li><p>
Processor: AMD64 4200+ Athlon X2
</p></li><li><p>
Power supply: Silverstone SST-ST65ZF 650 Watts
</p></li><li><p>
Memory: two sets of Corsair 1Gx2 TWINX2048-3200PRO modules (four total)
</p></li><li><p>
Video cards: matched pair of eVGA GF 7900GT 256 (NVIDIA SLI)
</p></li><li><p>
Case: Silverstone TJ07-S
</p></li><li><p>
Hard drives: 2x Seagate Barracuda 300GB 7200 RPM 8MB cache SATA 3.0Gb/s
</p></li><li><p>
DVD R+W: Plextor PX-716AL/SW SATA
</p></li><li><p>
   Monitor: Samsung LCD 204B 20.1"
</p></li><li><p>
Keyboard: Logitech Cordless Comfort Duo (includes mouse)
</p></li><li><p>
Mouse: Logitech G7 Laser Cordless mouse
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The above list includes the G7 Laser Cordless mouse simply because
that is what we ended up using, but we do not include it in our price
lists.  Your choice of keyboard and mouse are more personal than just
about anything else on your system (save, perhaps, your monitor).
We like the keyboard in
the Logitech Cordless Comfort Duo but not the mouse.  So we replaced the
mouse with a Logitech G7 Laser Cordless mouse.  We don't assume any of
you are going to do the same, so we don't make a fuss about keyboards
and mice in this do-it-yourself system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140bc90"></a>
The Do-It-Yourself Goal</h2></div></div><p>
Our goal for the do-it-yourself system was to create a high-powered Linux
desktop without breaking the bank.  Bang for the buck was our motto.
We created a powerful system with components that often fell just
below the big price breaks, after which you tend to pay a lot more for
only minimal performance gains.  In addition, we opted for a fan-based
enclosure instead of a more expensive (and usually harder to install)
liquid-cooling system.
</p><p>
We also include an alternate budget-minded system.  Our do-it-yourself budget system is still pricey,
but it delivers a lot of power at a considerably lower price than our
favorite configuration.
</p><p>
One very important consideration in our choices was, will this work
with most Linux distributions &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo;? We installed Debian,
Ubuntu/Kubuntu, Fedora Core 5, SUSE 10 and Mandriva on our do-it-yourself
system.  All of these distributions ran without any trouble and without
the need for any additional drivers or special driver management.  (We
did, however, use the proprietary NVIDIA drivers, not out of necessity,
but in order to make use of the SLI features of the motherboards.)
We also ran Knoppix, MEPIS and Kanotix live CDs without problems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140bea0"></a>
Motherboard</h2></div></div><p>
We chose to configure our do-it-yourself system around the ABIT AN8 32X
939 motherboard and an AMD64 4200+ Athlon X2 (dual-core) processor.
We chose the AMD64 4200+ based on price.  By the time you read this,
AMD will have lowered the prices on its line of dual-core processors,
so you can get more CPU bang for the same bucks than we did.  We used two
sets of matched pairs of Corsair memory modules (1Gx2 TWINX2048-3200PRO)
for a total of 4GB in four slots in dual-channel mode.
</p><p>
The motherboard is the foundation of any do-it-yourself system.  We looked
at three motherboards, all based on socket 939 AMD64: the ABIT AN8 32X,
MSI KN8 Diamond Plus and ASUS AN832-SLI Deluxe.  All three motherboards
sell for around $200 US or less, depending on your source.  The price
difference is not significant enough to choose one over another.
All of these motherboards support socket 939 dual-core AMD64 chips and
dual-channel memory.  All of the motherboards support two video cards
configured in SLI mode.  We tested the boards with two eVGA GeForce 7900GT video cards configured for SLI.
</p><p>
You aren't likely to be disappointed with any of these motherboards.
The MSI comes with the Creative Sound Blaster Audigy system integrated
on the motherboard, so Audigy fans will love the MSI.  Both the MSI and
ASUS boards include two LAN ports vs.  one port on the ABIT.  So if you
want two LAN connections, the MSI or ASUS could be the board for you.
</p><p>
However, it is easy to add network cards and sound cards to motherboards.
Despite the fact that the memory controller for the AMD64 is on the chip
itself, not the motherboard, it is not possible to force a motherboard
to support RAM differently than intended&mdash;at least it is impossible to
make a motherboard support 8GB of RAM if it is designed to support 4GB
or even just 3GB in practice.  That is why we felt the ABIT trumped the
other boards in the long run.  It takes better advantage of the memory
addressing capability of the AMD64 processor than the MSI or ASUS.
The ABIT motherboard supports up to 8GB of RAM.  The MSI and ASUS boards
say they support up to 4GB of RAM, but they seem to be designed with
32-bit Windows XP in mind, and therefore use only up to 3GB of RAM by
default, even if you have 4GB installed.  The AMD64 version of Linux
saw only 3GB of usable RAM on the MSI and ASUS boards.  Although it may be
possible to make all 4GB visible to Linux on the ASUS and MSI boards
by playing with BIOS settings, the ABIT saw all 4GB without any BIOS
modifications.  (The MSI manual implies that it is not possible to make
more than 3GB visible on that motherboard, but we did not attempt to
prove or disprove the implication.)
</p><p>
We populated the ABIT with four 1GB RAM modules, for a total of 4GB.
If you run 32-bit Linux, you should still be able to use all 4GB of RAM.
A properly configured 32-bit Linux kernel will map the RAM such that
a portion of it goes to the kernel and the rest goes to user space.
Linux splits up the RAM depending on how you have compiled the kernel
(or how it is precompiled on your distribution).
</p><p>
All of these boards have one more unexpected memory quirk.  When you
populate all four RAM slots, the motherboard clocks back the memory.  In our
case, it clocked back our memory from 400MHz to 333MHz.  This happens
regardless of the memory size of the modules you use.  The motherboards
will clock back the RAM based on the fact that you have populated all
four slots, not based on the total RAM in the system.
</p><p>
Again, it should be possible on all of these motherboards to adjust the
BIOS settings to reset the clock speed back to 400.  The BIOS on one
board may make it more difficult to do so than on another, but by the
time we addressed this issue, we already were sold on the ABIT.  We were
able to change the clock speed back to 400 on the ABIT board very easily.
We simply set the DRAM timing settings to run &ldquo;By SPD&rdquo; (by the speed
of the modules).  This reversed the clocking back of the RAM and set
the speed back to 400.  We haven't experienced any instability at this
speed, so it appears to be quite safe to make this change.  Granted,
you may not notice a performance improvement with the higher speed.
When it comes to RAM, latency settings tend to affect performance more
than speed.  We did not risk changing the latency settings to something
other than the specifications of the memory modules.
</p><p>
At this point, you should ask yourself whether
you really need 4GB or more RAM.  A total of 4GB could easily be
overkill for many, if not most, users.  If you think you will be content
with less RAM for the life of your system, that gives you more reason
to consider the MSI or ASUS boards, because all three boards will handle
two 1GB modules (for a total of 2GB) equally well.  But if, like us,
you're a glutton for RAM, the ABIT is the clear choice, regardless
of whether you run a 32-bit or 64-bit Linux system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c268"></a>
Power Supply</h2></div></div><p>
Never underestimate the importance of a good power supply for your
do-it-yourself system, especially if you intend to use two video
cards configured in SLI mode.  You can experience all kinds of bizarre
symptoms of instability if you underpower your system with an inadequate
power supply.  Don't go for anything less than a 500-Watt power supply
if you intend to use two video cards in SLI mode.  Go even higher if you
intend to add other PCI cards to your system.  And, when you shop for power
supplies, be careful to look for efficiency ratings.  Some power supplies
boast good peak output, but the sustained output can still be inadequate.
</p><p>
There's almost no point in choosing a power supply based on its rated
mean time between failures (MTBF), that is, how long it should last.
We suspect these figures reflect how long the power supply lasts assuming
the fan never fails.  Unfortunately, power supply fans fail all the time.
The power supply overheats, and kablooey, so much for the mean time
between failure rating.  Your mileage may vary, but we've had the best
luck with Enermax power supplies and their fans.
</p><p>
You will need a power supply with a 24-pin power connector to the
motherboard for any of the motherboards we tested.  You also will need
a power supply with connectors for two video cards, so that you can use
these motherboards in SLI mode.  We chose the Enermax ELT500AWT 500-Watt
power supply for our system.  It sells for about $100 US, depending
on your source.  We also used a Silverstone SST-ST65ZF 650-Watt power
supply for a similarly configured system.  It sells for about $170 US,
depending on your source.  We've had these power supplies only for a few weeks
at the time of this writing, but they both work well so far&mdash;knock on wood.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c420"></a>
Case</h2></div></div><p>
We pulled out all the stops when it came to a case for our Ultimate
Do-It-Yourself System.  We chose the Silverstone TJ07-S case, which
sells for about $365 US, depending on your source.  This is quite expensive
for a case, but it is worth the investment.  First, the thing is huge.
It's larger than any tower case we've ever tried.  This gives you tons of
room to work when you insert cards and cable the system.  On the other
hand, if you're looking for a case you can place on top of the desk
instead of beside it, this is definitely <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the case for you.
</p><p>
The hard drives are tucked away in two separate removable compartments,
and each compartment is cooled with its own separate 120mm fan.  It has
two more 120mm fans at the top of the case, and two rear 92mm intake
fans.  The case is remarkably quiet, considering it has six fans, not
including the CPU fan, power supply fans and so forth.  All this ventilation
keeps everything very cool without having to invest the time and effort
in creating a liquid-cooled system.
</p><p>
The case has a flip-down front accessory panel with connectors for audio,
USB and FireWire.  The panel is flush with the front of the case,
so you simply press on the bottom of the panel to open it.
Some people might be annoyed that there's no spring loading, no button
and no catch for the panel, either in its open or closed state.  We have
no complaints with it though.
</p><p>
The only way to press the reset switch is to use a wire tool, which
you insert into a small hole in the front of the case.  Some people
will hate this feature, others will appreciate how it protects you from
accidentally resetting your system.
</p><p>
You can certainly find adequate cases for far less money, and some of
them may even place things like the accessory jacks in more convenient
locations.  But, we found this to be a superb case primarily because
of how easy it is to work inside it (thanks to its gigantic size) and
superior ventilation without having to use liquid cooling.
</p><p>
If you're going to go the budget route, there are so many decent
cases from which to choose, we're hard pressed to recommend one over
another.  Each has its advantages and disadvantages.  We chose the
Thermaltake Tsunami VA3000BWA, which sells for just over $100 US at most
outlets.  It's not as high class as the Silverstone, and we found it
frustrating to get the DVD drive installed, but it's a fair case for the
price.  It has a flip-up top accessory panel.  People who leave things
on top of their computer case will find this inconvenient, but the same
must be said of the Silverstone case, as it has top-mounted fans you
can block by leaving manuals or other paraphernalia on top of the computer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c738"></a>
Video Cards</h2></div></div><p>
Yes, you can use two NVIDIA cards in SLI mode on Linux&mdash;if you don't
mind running the proprietary NVIDIA driver, which taints the Linux kernel.
We chose a pair of eVGA GeForce 7900GT cards with 256MB of RAM.
These cards are a great compromise between price and performance.
The combination of cards totals at about $500 US, which is less than
the price of a single NVIDIA 7900 GTX card (about $570 US).  eVGA sells
basically the same cards with different clock speeds at different prices.
For example, budget-minded folks can get a single eVGA GeForce 7900GT
Signature 256MB (same basic model as the ones we used in SLI mode)
with higher clock speeds for about $360 US.
</p><p>
You obviously have more choices than eVGA when it comes to video card
manufacturers.  We chose eVGA for our examples simply because the company
produces a large selection of prices and configurations of NVIDIA cards,
which made it easy to pick cards to fit varying budgets.  We've had good
success with other brands as well.
</p><p>
If you opt to use the NVIDIA proprietary drivers, you need to add the
following line to your xorg.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Option	"SLI"	"Auto"
</pre>
</p><p>
We also recommend that you dig through the NVIDIA HOWTO to learn how to
specify whether you're using a digital or analog connector.  Some monitors
like to guess which interface you're using for five seconds or so, which
can cause annoying delays when you start your desktop.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c9a0"></a>
Drives</h2></div></div><p>
You've got a wide range of drives to choose from, and good SATA drives
are amazingly inexpensive.  We chose two Seagate Barracuda 300GB 7200
RPM drives with 8MB Cache.  These drives are SATA 3.0Gb/s drives, so
they're fast, and all three motherboards can handle these types of drives.
We chose two identical drives for RAID 0 configuration, which produces
even faster disk access (though without any fault tolerance).  You can
pick just one of these if you're on a budget.  They go for about $100 US
each.  If you're not a fan of Seagate for any reason, you can get other
brands of drives that work just as well for about the same price.
</p><p>
Plextor offers a SATA DVD R+W drive, the PX-716AL/SW for about $150 US.
This drive has the following write speeds: DVD+R at 16x, DVD+RW at 8x,
DVD-R at 16x, DVD-RW at 4x, CD-R at 48x, CD-RW at 24x, DVD+R DL at 6x
and DVD-R DL at 6x.  It offers read speeds at 16x DVD-ROM and 48x CD-ROM.
Be careful when selecting a SATA-based DVD/CD drive, however.  You can
run into Linux installation problems if you choose a Linux distribution
with a kernel configured such that it doesn't recognize a SATA DVD/CD
drive properly.
</p><p>
We chose a Plextor PX-750A ATAPI drive for our budget combination,
because it costs only about $60 US.  You can find cheaper drives, but the less
you pay, the noisier and more unreliable they tend to be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140cb58"></a>
Accessories</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, you will need, at the very least, a monitor, keyboard and mouse
to have a complete system.  We don't make much of a favorite monitor,
keyboard or mouse because your favorites will depend a great deal on
your personal tastes.  Some people like wide monitors; others don't.
Some people like wireless keyboards; others don't.  Some people like
ergonomic design; others don't.
</p><p>
Our summary sample configurations do include
a monitor, keyboard and mouse.  We did so only to give you an idea
of the total price you can expect if you are going to put together a
complete system.  Your total price probably won't change much if you
choose a different keyboard or mouse, but monitor prices vary greatly
depending on what kind of monitor you want.  So, take our prices with a
grain of salt.  If you opt for a big, wide-screen monitor, you're
obviously going to pay more.
</p><p>
We chose for our example a Samsung 204B, because it has a fairly large
screen (20"), good resolution (1600x1200), good contrast ratio (800:1)
and an unusually fast response time (only 5ms).  It's a great monitor
for work and gaming, at a good price&mdash;about $400 US.
</p><p>
Extremely budget-minded people can go for something like the Acer AL1515,
which is smaller (15"), lower resolution (1024x768) and much slower
(16ms).  This monitor can be good for work but terrible for gaming.
But the price is much lower at about $150 US.
</p><p>
As for keyboard and mouse, we chose two Logitech combinations, the
Wireless Comfort Duo (about $75 US) and the wired Internet Pro (about $18
US).
You have a lot of wiggle room here.  You can get better keyboards and
mice without having to spend a whole lot more money, but the Comfort Duo
should be enough for most users.  We happened to replace the mouse that
comes with the Comfort Duo with a Logitech G7 Laser Cordless, but you
may find this mouse to be a royal pain, because it requires you to swap
batteries as much as twice daily.  Fortunately, it comes with two lithium
ion batteries, one of which stays in a charger while you use the other.
But because this is an unlikely choice for many people, we stuck with the
Cordless Duo as the standard choice for the preferred system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x1403650"></a>
Playing with Prices</h2></div></div><p>
We put together two systems, a great system and a more budget-minded
system.  If you have money to burn, you easily could pump up the great
system into an ultimate system.  Trick it out with the two best NVIDIA
cards on the market in SLI mode.  Add a liquid-cooled system that
you connect to everything in the box that generates heat.  Go for the
top-of-the-line AMD64 processor instead of the 4200+.  You'll pay a lot
more, but you'll get what you pay for.  The AMD Athlon 64 FX60 Toledo
runs for just under $1,000 US.
</p><p>
The second combo uses a less-expensive case, a single video card and
less memory in order to save cash.  You can cut other corners as well, but
we chose those components that were at a price threshold where a better
component would cost significantly more money.  For example, at the time
of this writing, the difference between an AMD64 4000+ and an AMD64 4200+
is about $30 US, but the price difference jumps to $100 US between the 4200+
and the 4400+.  As mentioned earlier, AMD is likely to have restructured
all these prices by the time you read this, so the threshold where the
price jumps probably will be different.  Choose accordingly.
</p><p>
The same tends to hold true for video cards.  There's a point at which
the price increase doesn't get you much extra performance, so you
have to think hard in order to decide whether you want to spend
the extra cash for the edge.  At the time of this writing, the NVIDIA 7900GT
series is affordable and fast.  If you really need a budget card,
the eVGA GeForce 6600GT 256MB PCI Express x16 goes for about $150 US,
and although it doesn't compete well with the 7900 series, it's no slouch.
</p><p>
Perhaps no category includes a wider variety of prices than monitors.
We didn't explore the vast range in our do-it-yourself kit, simply because
a choice of monitor can be intensely personal.  We can't tell you which
one you'll like best, but we can tell you that the price difference
between a monitor you like and one you love can be as much as $1,000 US
or more.  We're very happy with the Samsung 204B.  You might need more,
or you might be happy with less.

1) Mount your CPU carefully.  The CPU itself is generally very easy
to mount.  The AMD64 is particularly easy because the pin locations
prevent you from inserting it incorrectly (previous versions of AMD CPUs
prevented you from inserting the chip incorrectly too, but not as well
as the AMD64).
</p><p>
The CPU heat sink/fan combination can be anything from a breeze to a
nightmare to install, depending on many factors.  Some motherboards locate
the CPU in awkward places or place heat pipes and other components too
close to the mounting bracket.  Sometimes it's just hard to get the heat
sink mounted for no particular reason.
</p><p>
There are lots of third-party CPU heat sinks and fans available.
If you are going to use one, find one that mounts easily.  Some of the
best coolers require you to place a bracket beneath the motherboard,
or even if they don't, they are installed most easily before you mount
the motherboard in the computer.  Consider this possibility before you
install the motherboard.
</p><p>
2) Examine the layout of your case before installing anything.
For example, in some cases (no pun intended), you may find that it
is easiest to install the power supply first.  Many cases place the
power supply across from the location where your DVD/CD drive will go.
It's usually much easier to mount the drive after the power supply is
installed than vice versa.  If you install your drive first, you may
find yourself having to twist and turn the power supply just to get
it into a position where it will slide into place.  If you've already
installed other things, like your motherboard, this can lead to disaster,
as the twisting and turning may scrape components on the motherboard.
</p><p>
Another common problem occurs when you install your hard drives before
you install add-in cards like your video card.  Many cases place the hard
drives directly across from the video card.  We have actually had the
experience where we had to move a hard drive to another slot in order
to make a video card fit.
</p><p>
3) Suck it in and blow it out.  Mount your fans in such a way that you
get the best possible air circulation.  Fans blow air in one direction.
Make sure you mount the fan such that it blows the right way.  It's way
too easy to mount fans willy-nilly and have the near-the-CPU
case fan blowing onto the processor instead of drawing the hot air out,
which is what it's supposed to do.
</p><p>
4) Drives get hot too.  You can lengthen the life of your hard drives
and keep your whole computer considerably cooler by making sure you have
fans blowing on the hard drives.  Good cases provide ways to mount fans
that cool your hard drives by pulling air off them and blowing the air
out of the case.  The Silverstone case we used cools drives extremely
well.  But if your case doesn't fan your drives, you always can buy
drive fans that mount on the bottom of the drive.  Beware, however,
some cases make it impossible to use these under-the-drive fans.
They may not provide enough room, or they may have unusual drive mounting
schemes that prevent you from using these neat-o devices.
</p><p>
5) Tie-wraps are your friends.  Loose cables can create nightmares
in the long run.  They flop around and can get caught in fan blades.
When you're finally done assembling your system and are satisfied
everything works properly, get in there and tie your cables together.
Make sure you bunch the cables in such a way that they remain out of
key ventilation paths or other sensitive areas.  Don't forget to snip
the long ends of the tie wraps and discard them.
</p><p>
6) Video cards can be surprisingly fragile.  They are notoriously
easy to break if you don't handle them carefully.  We've knocked a
capacitor off at least two video cards in our history of assembling
do-it-yourself computers simply by holding the video card in the wrong
place while removing it from the package or while inserting it into
its slot in the computer.  It's also easy to knock capacitors off the
boards while moving cables or otherwise doing work inside your computer.
We're not talking about scrunching the board like we're the Incredible
Hulk, either.  The capacitors almost jump off the board with very little
pressure applied.  We're not sure why video card manufacturers mount
these components so precariously, but they do, so beware.
</p><p>
7) There is a jumper, switch or other device on your motherboard that
allows you to clear the BIOS settings.  Use it to clear the BIOS settings
before you boot your do-it-yourself system for the first time.
</p><p>
8) Read your manual with respect to installing RAM modules.  All the
motherboards we tried support dual-channel access to RAM, but you have
to insert the modules in a certain order for dual channel to work.
