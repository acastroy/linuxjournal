The new AM2 socket-based AMD Athlon 64 dual-core processor goes beyond
11.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14af580.0x15a72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We got our hands on an AMD rev.  F Processor (FX-60 or X2-5000+), along with
the ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard built for this processor, and we're
convinced this points the way to the future of the Ultimate Linux Box.
</p><p>
The movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>This Is Spinal Tap</em></span> is about a fictional heavy metal band with
members who aren't very bright.  In one scene, a guitarist mentions that
if he cranks up his guitar to volume ten, and cranks up the amplifier
to volume ten, that's as loud as it gets.  There's nowhere left to go.
Then he boasts of an amplifier he has whose knobs are numbered up to
11.  Rob Reiner, the host, asks if he couldn't just buy an amplifier
that is louder at volume ten.  The guitarist looks confused for a moment
and then says, &ldquo;But this one goes to 11.&rdquo;
</p><p>
CPUs are close to the point where they've gotten to ten, and there's
nowhere left to go.  AMD and Intel have been bumping up against Moore's
Law for a while now.  They can pump only so many Gigahertz out of a
processor.  Enter the dual-core processors.  At this point in history,
it's easier to improve performance by adding a second core than it is
to try to keep cranking up the GHz ratings (although AMD and Intel do
that too).
</p><p>
That takes care of the processor's technology bottleneck, but it doesn't
address the next bottleneck in performance: how to get the processor
to talk to RAM in the most efficient way possible.  So far, we've seen
AMD and Intel attempt to address this bottleneck by pumping up the
front-side bus frequency and by supporting newer, faster types of RAM
and RAM configurations.
</p><p>
Fast-forward to yesterday (relatively speaking).  Intel supports DDR2
RAM, but the best AMD can do is DDR in dual-channel mode&mdash;hence the
need for the new AM2 socket-based AMD64 processors.  The differentiating
factor between the old socket 939 line of AMD64 dual-core processors and
the new socket AM2 processors of the future is that the new processors
include an on-die memory controller for DDR2 RAM.  Otherwise, the two
processors are essentially the same.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14af580.0x15a7608"></a>
Do or Die</h2></div></div><p>
The operative phrase is &ldquo;on-die&rdquo;.  This is now the differentiating factor
between AMD and Intel processors.  Currently, Intel must use an onboard
memory controller in order to access DDR2 RAM.  Although theory and practice
do not always match, this, in theory, gives AMD a big advantage over
Intel in the long run.
</p><p>
Why? One of the biggest performance bottlenecks with respect to memory
access is latency.  Latency is the time the processor has to wait before
it can get the information it requests.  AMD has reduced latency&mdash;in
theory&mdash;by putting the memory controller on the CPU itself instead
of relying on an on-the-motherboard memory controller.  In fact, all
AMD64 processors include the memory controller on-die.  The difference
between the socket 939 processors and the socket AM2 processors is that
the AM2-based processors have a future, because they support DDR2.
</p><p>
DDR is an eventual dead end.  Today, DDR2 delivers little if any
improvement over DDR, but DDR2 is improving all the time.  In fact,
Corsair released new DDR2 memory modules at about the same time AMD
released the socket AM2 processors.  The timing is not a coincidence.
You can't see any benefit in the socket AM2 processors without better
DDR2 modules.
</p><p>
As it is, you can't see much benefit even with the better DDR2 modules.
But that's because we're still in the early stages of DDR2 performance.
Until recently, DDR2 performance has been a dog.  The newest DDR modules
are a lot better than the ones you could get just months ago.  And DDR2
should improve steadily over time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14af580.0x15a7870"></a>
Where Lies the Future?</h2></div></div><p>
The question will be, which processor will best be able to exploit the
performance increases in DDR2? AMD is preparing to win that battle with
its on-die memory controller.  Only time will tell, but I'd place my
bets on AMD.  It simply makes more sense to put the memory controller
on-die rather than increase latency by relying on a memory controller
on the motherboard, as is the way Intel processors currently work.
</p><p>
You've probably seen countless benchmarks of the socket AM2 processors by
now, most of which show very little improvement over existing processors.
We tried the same type of comparison and found that the X2-5000+
dual-core socket AM2 processor blew away our AMD64 4400+ Athlon x2.
That's not too surprising, because there's a fairly significant increase
in processing speed.  But, we didn't have an apples-to-apples system with
which to compare the new one.
</p><p>
Here's the trick.  AMD claims that even with DDR2 memory, speed isn't
the issue, latency is.  If you're familiar with how processors access
memory, you'll know this is a perfectly credible statement in theory.
But does it play out in practice?
</p><p>
We wanted to see if latency really does affect performance as much as AMD
claims and reason dictates.  AMD sent out a number of sample products
to reviewers early on, when DDR2 modules still had high-latency issues.
When AMD finally released the socket AM2 processors, it claimed we would
see about a 1% performance increase over the early samples.  We didn't
have an early sample, so we compared the previous latency capabilities of
DDR2 to the current ones by changing the latency settings in BIOS.  We ran
a memory/cache benchmark using the two different latency settings.  You
can see the performance with faster settings (4,4,4,12) in Figure 1.
See Figure 2 for the benchmark results for the old latency settings
(5,5,5,15).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9063f1.large.jpg"><img src="9063f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Memory and Cache Performance with Latency Set at 5,5,5,15
</p></div></div><p>
Do you see the difference? Maybe not.  Try to squint your eyes and
turn your head a little and look again.  If you look carefully enough,
you will see some differences in performance.  But we can save you the
headache of trying to interpret the numbers in a moment.
</p><p>
First, just for fun, we wanted to show you the huge difference between
these benchmarks and the same benchmark on the AMD64 4400+ (see Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9063f3.large.jpg"><img src="9063f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Performance on AMD 4400+ Athlon x2 with 4GB of Dual-Channel DDR400 RAM
</p></div></div><p>
Now, back to the latency issue.  There really is a performance difference
between the two latency settings on the AM2, but admittedly, it's hard
to see from the graphs shown here.  So, we ran some Windows-based graphics
benchmarks to find out if we could see the difference more clearly.  We started
with AMD's own nbench.  We ran nbench on the ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe
with the 5000+ processor, tricked out with two eVGA 7900GT NVIDIA video
cards in SLI mode, with antialiasing and anisotropic filter settings
set to application-controlled.  Table 1 shows
the results of nbench for the different latency timings.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x14af580.0x15a80b0"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Comparing nbench with Different Latency Settings

We'll do the math for you.  There's about a 1% difference in performance,
exactly as AMD had predicted.  Just for kicks, we cranked up the graphics
settings to the best possible antialiasing and anisotropic filtering.
Although the overall performance dropped some due to the extra work, the
difference in performance between the two latency settings was about 1%
once again.
</p><p>
The next benchmark comparison is apples to oranges, but it does show
that the improvement over the AMD64 4400+ is enough to make our mouths
water over the new system, regardless of where it's getting its kick.
See Table 2.  Even with the graphics settings
entirely maxed out for best quality, the AM2 system boasted a 15%
performance improvement over the 4400+ system, despite the fact that
the 4400+ system had four times the RAM installed.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x14af580.0x15a8c08"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 2. The 5000+ AM2 puts the 4400+ 939 to shame.</b></p><table     summary="Table 2.

The problem with all these numbers is that they cannot reflect what
a joy it is to behold the new system render graphics.  Excerpts from
unreleased games (unreleased because no current system can handle them)
run like movies on the socket AM2 system, even with all the graphics
settings set to the max.  They don't quite run like slideshows on the
4400+ system, but the choppiness is extremely annoying, even with all
of the graphics settings turned down to a minimum.
</p><p>
More important, the 1% difference in performance with the changes in
latency settings may not look like much on paper, but it is often easy
to see the improvement when you run the 3-D graphics benchmarks.  This is
because a 3-D scene looks best at 30 frames per second or better.  When the
frame rate hovers between 25 frames per second or less and 30-some
frames per second, you really notice a 1% performance difference.  Even a
slightly more choppy rendering of a scene can be noticeably annoying.
</p><p>
We saw something closer to a 2% performance improvement when we ran the
Windows-based AquaMark3 benchmark with the different latency settings
(Table 3).  This particular benchmark doesn't drop into the
critical frame rates, so you don't notice the difference in performance as
much as you do with other benchmarks.  But you can see from the figures
that the frame rates do change with different latency settings.

The Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>
We drooled when we received the AMD rev. F Processor (FX-60 or X2-5000+)
along with the ASUS M2N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard built for this processor.
Sure, we'd heard about how this is only an incremental improvement over
existing AMD64 Socket 939 processors and their motherboards.  In fact,
most opine that there's no improvement at all.  As it turns out, many
benchmarks show that there is minimal improvement in performance.
</p><p>
But, we think most reviews are missing the forest for the trees.  The AM2
socket-based processors and boards aren't about delivering an exponential
improvement in performance <span   class="emphasis"><em>today</em></span>.  This is about laying the
foundation for exponential improvements in performance for the future.
We can't tell you whether it is worth it for you to invest in
today's socket-AM2 motherboards and processors.  The risk you take is
mostly dependent upon how quickly memory manufacturers can improve
DDR2 and whether your motherboard will support the improved
DDR2 modules.
</p><p>
In the long run, however, DDR2 will most definitely improve, and AMD
will undoubtedly ship quad-core processors that require DDR2 and lower
latency in order to exploit the advantages of quad-cores.  So, although it
may be frivolous to invest in a socket AM2 system today, we predict that
the time is coming when the benefits will be indisputable.  It is entirely
possible that Intel can pull a rabbit out of its design hat and trump the
AMD approach, but we don't see that happening yet.  That's why we consider
the socket AM2 systems as the Ultimate Linux Boxes of the future.
