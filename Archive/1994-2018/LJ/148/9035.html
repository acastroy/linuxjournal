The Ultimate Multimedia Center actually slides in under a million dollars.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b55580.0x1c4d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Venice Beach is one of my favorite beaches in the world, and when
I go to the Los Angeles area, I try to visit the beach, just
to stroll along the sidewalk and watch the people.  One of the
people I like to watch for is my friend Clay Claiborne who owns
Cosmos Engineering, and who named his Web site Linux Beach.
</p><p>
Clay is a Linux advocate from way back, and on my last trip out
there, he was bragging about the multimedia system he had
built for his house using Linux to control it.  When I heard
about the Ultimate Linux System issue coming up, I put Clay to the
challenge.
</p><p>
Now, the first thing a person has to understand is that there is
no upper limit for what you can spend on multimedia equipment,
and that of course also means the computer system you can buy to
capture, edit and play back the multimedia.  If I wanted to buy
an &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; system, I would simply set aside a million dollars
or so and go from there.  So, the first place we started with was
what a person who had a great love for multimedia, but an average-sized wallet would want in a system.  I am sure we will get
lots of letters complaining that our system was not
&ldquo;ultimate&rdquo;
enough, but I hope those letters will be outweighed by the ones
that say, &ldquo;Gee, I can almost afford that, and it is really
cool&mdash;it all works together and it was easy to install.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Along those same lines, Clay designed two systems.  Each one is
expandable, but one is a bit less expensive than the other,
for those with smaller wallets.  Clay has pledged to supply us
with all the specs and the software he uses on them so people can
build them from scratch.  For those with more money than time,
Clay will be happy to order, assemble, install the software, test
and ship them to you, and you may well be happy to buy the
service.  Your choice.
</p><p>
In honor of his love for the seaside, Clay has named these systems
the Linux Beach MultiMedia Center 500 (LBMC 500) and the Linux Beach
MultiMedia Center 1000 (LBMC 1000).

First, both systems come with a remote control (who
wants to get off the couch?), and both systems are designed to be
whisper quiet through the use of specialized cases, careful attention
to power supply selection and selection of graphics
cards that have no extra fan.
</p><p>
The smaller LBMC 500 system uses the Ninja 2 case, which was designed with
low noise in mind.  Although it does have a door on the front [I
hate doors&mdash;md] you can get to the DVD without opening it.
There are also two USB ports, one FireWire port and a set of headphone
and mic jacks on the front for easy access.  The power
supply is 400W&mdash;more than adequate for the smaller system.
</p><p>
The larger LMBC 1000 is built around the Antec Sonata II case, which
also was designed for quiet operation.  It uses a SmartPower
2.0 450-Watt power supply that is &ldquo;smart enough to turn its fan
off when it is not needed&rdquo;, as Clay puts it.  Following along the
lines of &ldquo;quiet&rdquo;, the CPU fan is also RPM-controlled for low
noise levels.  Clay says he added blue LEDs to the front of the
case so you will know it is turned on.  Unfortunately, with this case,
you have to open the front door to get to your DVD drive, but the
extra noise muffling makes that reasonable.
</p><p>
At my urging, Clay also chose as an alternative to the Antec
Sonata II, the Antec Overture II Quiet Media case for those
people who like their media centers to be horizontal instead of
vertical.  But <span   class="emphasis"><em>please</em></span> remember not to block the ventilation holes
with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.  Both the vertical and horizontal cases have
two USB
ports, one FireWire and audio ports on the front.
</p><p>
Both systems use the same motherboard, the Gigabyte GA-K8NF-9.  The smaller
system gives you an 800Mbps FireWire port along with its
<span   class="emphasis"><em>eight</em></span>
USB 2.0 ports.  In order not to use those high-speed ports for anything
other than high-powered storage, the motherboard also gives you
S/PDIF Digital Audio In and Out to drive your surround sound 5.1
or 7.1 audio system, as well as eight channels out to drive analog
amplifiers directly.  It also gives you a parallel printer port and one
RS-232 com port
for those legacy peripherals, as well as PS/2
ports for mouse and keyboard.  Video out is supplied by standard
analog VGA, digital DVI or S-Video for the TV.  Two monitors or a
monitor and a TV can be used for different signals at the same
time.  The TV is properly set up with over scan so that everything
appears as it should.  Video can be captured with the TV
tuner, composite or S-Video in.  Finally, Gigabit LAN gives you
the tightest possible connection to the world.
</p><p>
The larger system gives you the same features, but
<span   class="emphasis"><em>three</em></span> 800Mbps FireWire
ports, <span   class="emphasis"><em>ten</em></span> USB 2.0 ports and two RS-232 com ports.
</p><p>
Both motherboards also use the NVIDIA nForce4 chipset on the
mainboard to provide the best PCI timing and drive a 3Gb/s SATA
bus, two PCI and two PCI-Ex1 slots for expansion.  The NVIDIA GeForce
video output is driven at twice the speed of an AGP 8X through
the PCI-EUR-Express 16 port.
</p><p>
The CPU is the next place that the two systems differ.  Although
both use a 64-bit AMD processor with an 800MHz memory bus speed
and 4GB memory maximum, the larger system uses a dual-core
chip, effectively giving you about twice the CPU power, although
either chip is honking at the speeds they are going.  And although
the larger system comes with 1GB of memory standard, the smaller
one comes with &ldquo;only&rdquo; 512MB.  [maddog remembers when he paid
$23,000 US for 1MB of semiconductor memory and $128,000
for 64 Kilobytes of Core&mdash;he will tell you some time
what &ldquo;Core&rdquo; is.]
</p><p>
Both systems offer you an upgrade of both CPU and memory to your
wallet's capacity.  The CPUs offered for the LBMC-500 are the AMD
Athlon 64 3200+ (optional) or the 3700+ or 4000+ as options.
For the LBMC-1000, the CPUs are the AMD Athlon 64 2X 4200+ (standard),
or the optional upgrade to the 4600+.
</p><p>
Speaking of capacity, the smaller system comes with a MAXTOR
250GB, 7200 RPM SATA drive with 16MB of cache, but it can be ordered
with two of these drives in the system for a bit more money.  The
larger system comes with a MAXTOR drive that is 400GB standard,
and a second drive could be added.  Both systems sport a Sony
double layer (16x) DVD rewritable optical disk drive that can
hold up to 8.5GB on a disk.  The Sony's CD-R write speed is 48x.
</p><p>
For those of you who are really starved for storage, the 800Mbps
FireWire will give you amazing storage capacities outside the
main CPU cabinet.
</p><p>
The TV tuner card in each system is the Hauppauge WinTV PVR150.
Don't be turned off by the WinTV part, it is nicely supported
by Linux.  You also can get the pcHDTV HD3000 as an additional
upgrade on both systems.  With this second tuner, you get to watch
and record high-definition TV, and also record one program while
watching another, or record two TV programs at once.  Clay tells
me that on the larger system you can install enough tuners to
record six TV channels at one time.  But Clay, I have other
things to do with my life than watch TV&mdash;like listen to music!

Just a Matter of Software</h2></div></div><p>
TiVo changed my life.  I never watched much TV at all in my adult
years, but I was very loyal to the shows I watched.  TiVo allowed
me to watch what I wanted, when I wanted.  A couple of problems
though&mdash;it was available only in the US, and although it was
running Linux, it had big &ldquo;do not open this box&rdquo; labels on it.
Of course, intrepid Linux hackers ignored this warning, and soon
TiVos had much larger storage capacities and remote setup and so on.
</p><p>
Clay calls the software MythTV &ldquo;TiVo on steroids&rdquo;, and
although <i  >Linux Journal</i>
does not condone drug usage of any type, I have to agree.
</p><p>
The core software of this system is Ubuntu.  Clay chose Ubuntu
because it gave good basic support to the multimedia, and because
he likes their slogan, &ldquo;I am what I am because of who we all
are&rdquo;.
I have to admit that I like that slogan too.
</p><p>
Clay installs all of the core Ubuntu to make it easily available
to the end user to tailor.  So, you could run your Web server off
your multimedia center.  You also could use your multimedia center
to handle your e-mail.  Your choice.
</p><p>
On the other hand, you could use it just to record the TV shows
that you want to watch and then play them back again using the
MythTV software that Clay integrates.  Or, use MPlayer to play
your DVDs and other audio/video files in a huge number of formats.
Or use XMMS to play back music, create playlists or create visual
aids to go with your music.
</p><p>
And, of course, the remote is supported by MythTV, MPlayer and
XMMS.
</p><p>
Clay also mentions that although all of the day-to-day audio/video
functions can be controlled by this remote, you may want to get a
wireless keyboard and mouse to operate the system better.

get a soda from the fridge.
