Who says &ldquo;easy-to-use mandatory access controls&rdquo; is a contradiction
in terms?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9d4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my article &ldquo;Security Features in SUSE 10&rdquo;
(<i  >LJ</i>, April 2006), I described Novell
AppArmor, a partial implementation of mandatory access controls (MACs)
that is now part of SUSE Linux.  Since that writing, Novell has released
the source code of AppArmor under the GPL.  It's entirely possible that
in the near future, AppArmor will be ported to other Linux distributions
that support Linux security modules.
</p><p>
This is great news.  In my opinion, AppArmor represents a major
step forward in making MAC technology a feasible option for system
administrators who want strong security controls but don't have the
time or patience to configure and maintain a complicated &ldquo;trusted
OS&rdquo;
such as SELinux.
</p><p>
This month, I introduce the concept of mandatory access controls,
describe the difference between Novell AppArmor and NSA SELinux, and
show you how to get started with AppArmor on your SUSE systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9d768"></a>
Introduction to Mandatory Access Controls</h2></div></div><p>
The easiest way to describe mandatory access controls is to contrast it
with discretionary access controls (DACs).  Most general-purpose operating
systems use a DAC security model, in which the owner of a given system
resource (file, directory and so forth) can set whatever access permissions
on that resource they like.  Stringent security controls, in general,
are optional.
</p><p>
By contrast, a computer with MAC has a global security policy to which all
users of the system are subject.  A user who creates a file on a MAC
system generally may not set access controls on that file that are weaker
than the controls dictated by the system security policy.
</p><p>
Most DAC implementations have several major problems,
emphatically including both Windows and Linux (except SELinux).  First
and most obvious is that, as with any scenario involving human beings,
making any type of work optional all but ensures that work won't
get done very often.  It takes work to use careful security
settings consistently, even in a DAC system.
</p><p>
Another problem with DAC is that DAC-based OSes tend to have a &ldquo;winner
take all&rdquo; security model, in which the only way to get anything important
done on the system is through the superuser account (root in Linux/UNIX,
Administrator in Windows).  Wholly compromising a system using such a
security model is generally a simple matter of hijacking some process
on that system that runs with root/Administrator privileges.
</p><p>
On a MAC-based system, however, the only thing the superuser account is
used for is maintaining the global security policy.  Day-to-day system
administration is performed using accounts that lack the authority to
change the global security policy.  As a result, it's impossible to
compromise the entire system by attacking any one process.  (Attacks
on the superuser account are still possible, however; for example,
by booting the system into single-user mode from its physical console.)
</p><p>
If mandatory access controls are superior to DACs, why aren't they
ubiquitous? Unfortunately, although MAC schemes have been available on
various platforms over the years, they traditionally have been much
more complicated to configure and maintain than DAC-based operating
systems.  Creating an effective global security policy requires detailed
knowledge of the precise (intended) behavior of every application on the
system.  Furthermore, the more restrictive the security controls are on
a given system, the less convenient that system becomes for its users
to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9da80"></a>
AppArmor vs. SELinux</h2></div></div><p>
AppArmor isn't the first mandatory access control scheme for Linux,
nor is it the most comprehensive.  It shares DNA, so to speak, with SELinux,
a project of the US National Security Agency.  (The shared DNA is the
Linux Security Modules, which provide kernel support for MAC.)
</p><p>
SELinux is a bundle of kernel modules and user-space configuration tools
that implement three different types of MAC:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Type enforcement (TE): associates a security &ldquo;label&rdquo; with every
system object.
</p></li><li><p>
Role-based access controls (RBACs): define particular actions and
contexts in which system objects may be involved.
</p></li><li><p>
Multi-level security (MLS): defines access controls against objects
based on data classification (sensitivity).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In SELinux, all three types of access controls (TE, RBAC and MLS)
are applied across the entire operating system.  This requires major
system applications to be SELinux-aware wherever possible, and it also
requires extensive setup by a knowledgeable system administrator (that
is, one who has carefully researched SELinux).  On the one hand, SELinux
is truly comprehensive.  On the other hand, configuring it is a fairly
major undertaking.
</p><p>
Novell AppArmor has a more modest objective: to restrict the behavior of
selected applications in a very granular but targeted way.  In focusing on
applications (at the expense of roles and data classification), AppArmor
is built on the assumption that the single biggest attack vector on most
systems is application vulnerabilities.  If the application's behavior is
restricted, the behavior of any attacker who succeeds in exploiting
some vulnerability in that application also will be restricted.
</p><p>
For example, suppose you're running a Web application that runs as user
nobody and uses user input to update a local text file.  On a typical
system, if an attacker compromised that Web application, for example,
by sending unexpected input, the attacker might succeed in gaining a
remote shell with the privileges of nobody.  If that Web application
were protected by AppArmor, however, all the attacker would be able to
do is alter that single text file.  It wouldn't be possible
for the attacker to spawn a remote shell (an unexpected action) or to
read or write any other files.
</p><p>
Comprehensive? By no means.  For non-AppArmor-protected applications,
the usual (limited) user/group permissions still apply, no controls
regarding data classification are provided, and normally, only a subset
of applications on the system have AppArmor profiles.
</p><p>
For the most part, root is still root, and if you use root access in
a sloppy or risky fashion, AppArmor generally won't protect you from
yourself.  But, if an AppArmor-protected application runs as root, and becomes
compromised somehow, that application's access will be contained, root
privileges notwithstanding, because those privileges are trumped by the
AppArmor policy (which is enforced at the kernel level, courtesy of
Linux security modules).
</p><p>
AppArmor is therefore only a partial implementation of mandatory access
controls.  But on networked systems, application security is arguably the
single-most important area of concern, and that's what AppArmor zeros
in on.  What's more, AppArmor provides application security through an
easy-to-use graphical user interface that is fully integrated with YaST.  (GUI
tools are now being developed for SELinux as well, but just how easy to
use these are is open to debate.)
</p><p>
Still, I'm stopping well short of suggesting AppArmor is interchangeable
with SELinux.  If, for example, you run Linux in a multiuser environment
(in which users have shell or database accounts) involving highly
sensitive data, there really is no substitute for the comprehensive
layers of access controls in SELinux.

Getting Started with AppArmor</h2></div></div><p>
Although AppArmor's open-source license hopefully will lead to ports on
other Linux distributions, for the time being AppArmor is available
only for SUSE Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise.  The rest of this article,
therefore, is necessarily specific to SUSE.  I'm scratching only
the surface here.  For detailed information on how to configure and
use AppArmor, see the AppArmor Admin Guide Using Yast, whose path is
/usr/share/doc/packages/subdomain-docs/ug_apparmor.pdf, provided
you've installed SUSE's subdomain-docs package.
</p><p>
Note: prior to being acquired by Novell, AppArmor previously was called
Immunix SubDomain.  Many of AppArmor's filenames and package names
still include the word subdomain.
</p><p>
AppArmor has its own YaST module, called Novell AppArmor (Figure 1).  As
you can see, most of the applets in this module deal with creating and
managing AppArmor Profiles.  Each application protected (confined)
by AppArmor must have its own AppArmor profile.  Profiles can be created
manually or by using the Add Profile and Update Profile Wizards or with
the Manually Add Profile applet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9036f1.large.jpg"><img src="9036f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. YaST's Novell AppArmor Module
</p></div></div><p>
The AppArmor control panel is used to enable and disable AppArmor
and to enable, configure and disable AppArmor security event
notification.  Important note: any time you enable AppArmor manually,
you must restart every AppArmor-protected application (simply rebooting
is your safest bet).  An application must start while AppArmor is already
running in order to benefit from its protection.  Obviously, if AppArmor
is enabled at boot time, you don't need to worry about this.
</p><p>
Two types of applications are particularly important to
protect: programs that run setuid root (that is, run with root's
privileges) and network applications.  AppArmor comes preconfigured with
profiles for a variety of setuid-root programs and network applications,
including Apache, ping, Firefox, Opera, Evolution, sshd, ld, Postfix,
Squid and Ethereal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xda5580.0xe9e528"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Two Handy Commands</b></p><p> You can identify all the commands and d&aelig;mons on your system
that are both owned by root and have their setuid bit set (that is,
that run with a user ID of root no matter who actually executes them),
with a single command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find / -user root -perm -4000 -print
</pre>
</p><p>
As with any other find / command, this takes a few minutes
to complete, but the output hopefully will be a short list.  In the
Internet-connected era, it's very bad form indeed to set the setuid
bit on any root-owned executable unless it's absolutely necessary, so
modern versions of Linux distributions tend to be very sensible in this
regard.  Still, you may be surprised by what you find.
</p><p>
One more handy command, this one peculiar to AppArmor, is
unconfined.  When run without arguments from a command prompt,
this command lists running network d&aelig;mons that are not protected
by AppArmor.  You must be root, and AppArmor must be enabled, for the
unconfined command to work.
</p></div><p>
Figure 2 shows the ping default profiles.  As you can
see, it consists of #include statements that reference the contents of
other profiles, access controls on POSIX capabilities (setuid, kill,
sys_boot and so forth) and file access controls.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9036f2.large.jpg"><img src="9036f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. AppArmor Profile for ping
</p></div></div><p>
There's actually a fourth element that Web server profiles may
contain&mdash;hat definitions.  Figure 3 shows part of the profile for httpd2 (Apache
2).  The entries at the top of the profile that begin [+] are hats.  A
hat is simply an embedded profile, a sub-profile, if you will.  Only
profiles for hat-aware applications can have hats, and even at that,
you must have SUSE's libimmunix and mod-change-hat packages installed
for hats to work.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9036f3.large.jpg"><img src="9036f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. AppArmor Profile for httpd2
</p></div></div><p>
The most common use of hats is for Web applications that are run
without actually being part of httpd d&aelig;mons.  Figure 4 shows the
contents of just such a hat, corresponding to a guestbook application on
my Web server.  The index.php script referenced in Figure 4 mainly needs
read access to some files, but it also needs to both read and write to the
guestbook file itself (book.gb) and also Apache's access log (access_log).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9036f4.large.jpg"><img src="9036f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Contents of gb Hat
</p></div></div><p>
If this seems confusing, don't worry.  It's seldom necessary to create
profiles (let alone hats) manually.  On many systems, you won't need to
create new profiles at all&mdash;periodically running the AppArmor Update
Profile Wizard when things don't work as expected may suffice.  This
wizard scans /var/log/messages for AppArmor-generated error
messages and allows you to update the corresponding AppArmor profiles
accordingly (either to allow or continue to disallow the event that
triggered each error).  Where appropriate/applicable, Update Profile Wizard
even will create new hats, again assuming you've installed the libimmunix
and mod-change-hat packages.

How to Create a New Profile Quickly</h2></div></div><p>
If you need to create a new profile from scratch, there are several
ways to do so, all explained in detail in the aforementioned Admin
Guide Using YaST and also in the AppArmor Advanced User's
Guide
(/usr/share/doc/packages/subdomain-docs/adv-ug-apparmor.pdf).  Here,
however, is the easiest method:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Run the Add Profile Wizard, being sure to specify the full path to the
program you want to protect when prompted for the application name.  You
will be prompted to run the program, during which time AppArmor runs in
&ldquo;learn&rdquo; mode, and builds a profile by observing the application's
behavior.
</p></li><li><p>
After the Add Profile Wizard closes, restart your application (if
a d&aelig;mon) and test it as thoroughly as possible.  If everything works
properly, you're done.
</p></li><li><p>
If anything failed in the previous step, run the Update Profile
Wizard.  Based on your answers to the Wizard's prompts, the AppArmor
profile you just created (plus any other applicable profiles) will
be updated.
</p></li><li><p>
Repeat steps two and three until the application works the way it did before
you created its AppArmor profile.  This may take more than two iterations.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
That's basically it! The excellent documents in
/usr/share/doc/packages/subdomain-docs explain not only the above
procedure, but also how to use the Add Profile Manually applet and
even how to create profiles from scratch using your text editor of choice.

Miscellaneous Notes</h2></div></div><p>
Before I close this month's column, I leave you with a couple
observations based on my experiences tinkering with AppArmor over the
past couple of months.  First, I must stress the importance of having a
healthy local logging facility.  As you can see, AppArmor relies heavily
on /var/log/messages not only for providing you with a good audit
trail, but also for providing its own wizards with crucial configuration
intelligence.  Therefore, if you have a customized system logger, make
sure that there's at least a symbolic link from /var/log/messages
to wherever your subdomain messages end up.
</p><p>
For example, on my chrooted syslog-ng installation, my subdomain
messages are written to /var/syslog-ng/var/log/messages.  Before
AppArmor would work properly on this system, I had to create a symbolic
link from /var/log/messages to this location.  I also had to edit
/etc/logrotate.d/syslog so that the &ldquo;real&rdquo; messages file
would be rotated when too large or old; otherwise, the symbolic link was
destroyed by my logrotate cron job.  (Obviously, I should have updated
logrotate.d/syslog already, back when I configured syslog-ng&mdash;by the time I got around to this, /var/syslog-ng/var/log/messages
had grown to an embarrassing and unwieldy size.)
</p><p>
Also, I should point out that, just like all of YaST's modules, you
don't need to be running the X Window System to run the Novell AppArmor
YaST applets.  You shouldn't be running X on Internet-connected servers,
both because it's almost never necessary and because X has a very rich
history of so-called local privilege escalation vulnerabilities.  It
may seem tempting to ignore such vulnerabilities if you're worried about
non-local attackers, but &ldquo;local&rdquo; is a usually a misnomer.  If
attackers gain shell access via, for example, a buffer-overflow attack against
some network d&aelig;mon, they often can exploit so-called local privilege
escalation vulnerabilities to promote themselves to root.
</p><p>
I hope you'll forgive me, therefore, for using attractive screenshots of
the X version of YaST in this article&mdash;I assure you that the content
and functionality is identical in the text-only versions of these
applets.
</p><p>
Finally, a tip&mdash;in the course of repeatedly running the Update
Profile Wizard to make my guestbook PHP script work, AppArmor
for some reason forgot I'd dealt with two particular events in
/var/log/messages and prompted me over and over about these two
events.  The problem went away when I manually deleted the corresponding
lines in /var/log/messages, and I haven't experienced that
particular anomaly since.  The problem may have had more to do with my
weird syslog-ng behavior than with anything in AppArmor, but I mention
it in case you experience anything similar.  AppArmor's log
messages always contain the string SubDomain.
