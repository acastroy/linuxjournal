JJPlus Corp.'s LinkGear Series 100</h2></div></div><p>
If Q were to make a Linux server to fit into 007's jacket pocket, it
might look something like the LinkGear Series 100.  This compact device,
so sayeth JJPlus, is &ldquo;the first affordable replacement for Intel-based
Linux PC servers in low power, small form factor applications.&rdquo;
Measuring in at 38mm x 203mm x 112mm (1.5" x 8" x 4.4") and
weighing 0.55kg (1.2lbs.), this little guy is a standard Linux server,
sporting an SH4-7751R RISC processor that consumes 2 Watts of power.
Other standard features include a pre-installed Linux OS (2.6.12 kernel)
based on GNU glibc and RPM; built-in firewall and wired or wireless
gateway features; two mini-PCI slots for wireless networking; USB 2.0;
and a NAND-flash block device driver compatible with fdisk, lilo and ext3
filesystem tools.  Optional features are an internal IDE/CF-ATA storage
adapter, an 802.3af-compliant PoE module, a Wi-Fi mini-PCI card and more.
Also included are complete native and cross-development tools, sources
and binary RPMs.  Mr Bond, you've foiled the bad guys again, this time
with the firewall in your pocket!

Mandriva Kiosk</h2></div></div><p>
Your valiant editor dithered a bit on whether to include this item, the
Mandriva Kiosk service, thinking it more at home in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TUX</em></span>, our
sister publication for the Linux desktop.  As you can see, the desktop
enthusiast in me cannot be subdued! According to the company, Mandriva
Kiosk is &ldquo;a Web-based one-click software installation service&rdquo; that offers
&ldquo;access to the latest versions of the most popular applications through
a simple installation process&rdquo;.  Packages with multiple dependencies,
such as KDE and GNOME, are aggregated into bundles and treated as a single
entity from the user's perspective.  Although the initial range of
available applications is a bit sparse, the offering will presumably
grow over time.  Although many of you may balk, arguing that you lose
valuable control of your system, I call on your inner evangelist.
Have you not a mother-in-law you wish to lure away from the dark side?
Subscriptions to Mandriva Kiosk start at 29.90 EUR (around $38 US)
per year.  Only newer releases of Mandriva Linux are supported.

Mark Sobell's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Practical Guide to Red Hat Linux: Fedora Core and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux</em></span>, 3rd Edition</h2></div></div><p>
Good golly, so many wonderful Linux books, so little time! We hope to
better use this space to tell you what's hot off the press and perhaps
worth a further look.  Now, it is a good sign if, in today's competitive
market, a book makes it into a 3rd edition, which is the case with Mark
Sobell's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Practical Guide to Red Hat Linux: Fedora Core and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux</em></span>.  The publisher, Prentice Hall, describes the book like
so: &ldquo;In 28 chapters, this book takes you from installing a Fedora Core
(updated for Fedora Core 5) or Red Hat Enterprise Linux system through
understanding its inner workings to setting up secure servers that run on
the system, as well as working with GNOME, KDE, Samba, sendmail, Apache,
DNS, NIS, and iptables.&rdquo; This new 3rd Edition includes beefed up info
on system administration, security issues, networking and server setup.
The publisher also notes how Sobell &ldquo;knows every Linux nook and
cranny&rdquo;,
indicating that this book is especially comprehensive.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>A
Practical Guide</em></span> spans nearly 1,100 pages and includes a DVD with the full Fedora Core 5 OS.

AccuSoft's VisiQuest</h2></div></div><p>
Those in our community involved in data and image analysis&mdash;researchers,
scientists, engineers and educators, among others&mdash;will be interested
in the latest update to the VisiQuest software application from AccuSoft.
VisiQuest's raison d'etre is to perform complex image and data analysis
tasks using visualization.  The latest release, per AccuSoft, features
a &ldquo;toolbox with 60 additional functions for image registration and
segmentation tasks&rdquo;.  Included therein is a plethora of new functions or
&ldquo;glyphs&rdquo; that help solve the challenge of mapping data of a rotated image
to a fixed image.  What's more, users can utilize these glyphs in a
drag-and-drop environment without the need for proprietary programming
languages; users can also roll their own glyphs in C, C++ or Perl.
In addition, AccuSoft announced a price reduction and a new, bundled
purchasing option.  Supported platforms include Linux, Mac OS, Windows
and UNIX.

Bill Childers, Jonathan Oxer and Kyle Rankin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu
Hacks</em></span> (O'Reilly
Media)</h2></div></div><p>
Yes, dear Reader, yet another book, based on the mildly presumptuous
assumption that you love them as much as I.  If the Ubuntu distro is your
fancy, you'll be happy as a clam, for an avalanche of great Ubuntu
books hits booksellers this summer and autumn.  Naturally, I must insert
a shameless plug for my friend and fellow <i  >LJ</i> editor,
Marcel Gagn&eacute; whose
title <span   class="emphasis"><em>Moving to Ubuntu Linux</em></span> should be available
sometime around now.
However, the focus of this blurb is a title from Tim O'Reilly's library,
namely <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Hacks</em></span> from the trio of Bill Childers, Jonathan Oxer and
Kyle Rankin.  All three authors are self-described &ldquo;passionate Ubuntu and
Kubuntu users&rdquo;.  The book is timely because, without a doubt, Ubuntu is
far and away the hottest distro out there and one of the most active hubs
of Linux-based innovation.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ubuntu Hacks</em></span> is meant to whet the appetite of
true hackers, those whom the authors describe endearingly as &ldquo;creative,
having the technical chops to get things done.&rdquo; Regardless of your level
of expertise, the folks at O'Reilly Media say that this book will
challenge you.  It contains more than 100 different hacks, that is, creative
ways to get the most out of your Ubuntu system, ranging from the basics
through to mobile computing, X11 tweaks, virtualization and emulation,
SOHO-level servers, security and more.

Imagine you're a small nontechnical retailer who wants to integrate your
internal systems with an eBay on-line store.  What do you do? One option
is to hire a team of coders and developers to do the job.  Jitterbit aims
to make that solution superfluous and allow you to accomplish complex
integrations on your own&mdash;all via drag and drop and without coding.
The Jitterbit open-source integration application can be used to connect
data from ERP and CRM applications, data warehouses, on-line marketplaces
and so on.  Some of the supported formats are Web services, XML, HTTP/S, FTP,
ODBC, flat and hierarchic file structures and file shares.  Customers
can choose between two different editions: a free, community-supported
edition and a professional edition, complete with enterprise-level support
and services.  The Jitterbit Community Edition for Linux or Windows is
available for free download at the company's Web site.

2X's ThinClientServer</h2></div></div><p>
2X wants to bring joy to managing your Windows desktops by turning
them into Linux ones&mdash;without users suspecting a thing! The company's
ThinClientServer, just upgraded to Version 3, is a tool for centrally
managing your network's desktops via thin client&mdash;that is, both
existing &ldquo;fat&rdquo;
PCs and thin-client devices from any vendor.  2X's approach is to deploy
a secure, self-updating, small-footprint, Windows-mimicking Linux desktop
to each client, which allows for central administration (Active Directory,
LDAP) of users' connection and device hardware settings (RDP/ICA/NX, screen
size and so forth), as well as which Windows apps are available.  Windows apps
are tunneled to clients either via the firm's application server or
Citrix Metaframe.  The upshot, says 2X, is that you avoid the technical
and financial hassles of Windows; desktop administration is simplified
(backup, updates and patching and so on); and unauthorized use of removable
media is impossible.  A free, five-client version can be downloaded from
2X's Web site.

Penguin Computing's Relion 1600 and 2600 Servers</h2></div></div><p>
Penguin Computing recently expanded its line of Relion servers, which
it targets at customers with memory/CPU-intensive, highly scalable,
high-performance computing needs.  The Relion 1600 (1U) and 2600 (2U)
servers offer the option of up to two of Intel's new Dual-Core Intel Xeon
5000-series processors per server and integrate the most up-to-date Intel
server technologies for improved performance.  The result, according to
Penguin's people, is &ldquo;twice the speed as previous designs within the same
power and space parameters&rdquo;, as well as reduced operating costs due to
&ldquo;cooler, more economical performance and greater workload capacity with
dynamic, instantaneous CPU performance scaling.&rdquo; These improvements are
possible due to Intel's Demand Based Switching and SpeedStep technologies,
which provide dynamic scaling of CPU performance depending on the
application's workload.  In addition, they enable automatic switching
from full, dual-core, dual-CPU utilization to a bare minimum level of
power consumption when idle.  Relion servers support Red Hat or SUSE
Linux operating systems.
