Puget Custom Computers packs a lot of power into our Ultimate Linux
Desktop.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeff580.0xff72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When determining the basic specifications for what the Ultimate Linux
Desktop should be capable of, one thing Editor in Chief Nicholas
Petreley and I agreed on was that it should have at least two NVIDIA
SLI GPUs.  If you're not familiar with SLI (Scalable Link Interface),
this technology allows you to run two or four GPUs (Graphics Processing
Units) either on a single card or a pair of cards to increase video
performance.  It works by splitting the processing work to render video
among the GPUs for each frame.
</p><p>
Why care about something fancy like SLI? Aside from the cool factor,
the Ultimate Linux Desktop needs to run modern games made available for
Linux.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom 3</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 4</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal Tournament 2004</em></span> all are capable of
taking advantage of this powerful feature, so why miss out? Aside from
games, SLI also benefits those doing high-end graphics work, especially
3-D graphics.  Any application that uses OpenGL graphics can take advantage
of this feature.  However, for high-end graphics workstations, you're
more likely to go quad SLI (four GPUs) rather than dual (two GPUs).
</p><p>
In conjunction with SLI, the motherboard needs SLI support.  For the
rest, it was mainly a wish list of what most people would like to see in
a desktop computer: plenty of fast RAM, fast networking, great audio,
front-panel USB, dual-core CPU and more.  Oh, and of course, all of it
has to be supported by Linux.  Another stipulation was the machine has to
come
with Linux pre-installed, or if the user has to install Linux themselves,
it can't be a difficult operation.
</p><p>
For the Ultimate Linux Desktop, we were going for ease of &ldquo;set up and
go&rdquo;.  We weren't considering anything that required hand-tweaking hardware
or installs, except for very basic operations.  Why be this fussy for the
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, the home of Linux geeks? The desktop is where the Linux
community is still getting its legs, and the ability to order a Linux
box pre-installed is definitely a helpful boost to beginners.  Linux is
no harder to install than Microsoft Windows, but average users never
install Windows on their own.  Many would rather purchase a new machine
than
try it.
</p><p>
So, enough with the introduction.  You want to know what machine won
and why.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeff580.0xff7710"></a>
Meet the Winner</h2></div></div><p>
The Ultimate Linux Desktop comes from Puget Custom Computers
(<a href="http://www.pugetsystems.com" target="_self">www.pugetsystems.com</a>).  From its High End Gaming Computer category,
the setup we received includes a number of desirable features (Figure
1).  This particular configuration costs $2,882.17 US before tax.  There is
no monitor, keyboard or mouse included.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9057f1.large.jpg"><img src="9057f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A custom-built machine from Puget Custom Computers is our
Ultimate Linux Desktop.
</p></div></div><p>
The CPU is an AMD Athlon 64 X2 4400+, which runs at 2.2GHz.  This
isn't the newest or fastest processor in its series, but it's at the
juicy price point for most users.  This dual-core CPU allows programs
built to take advantage of SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) to split
their processing tasks among the two cores.  In general, it's designed
for those who use a lot of multimedia or do a lot of multitasking,
which pretty well describes the job of an Ultimate Linux Desktop.
</p><p>
The motherboard is an ASUS A8N-SLI Premium, which is designed to make
it simple to activate or deactivate SLI support when needed.  On many
early SLI-based motherboards, you have to open the computer and change a
switch setting in order to accomplish this task.  The ASUS A8N-SLI Premium
allows you to do this in the BIOS instead or by using a Microsoft Windows XP
utility (unfortunately all of the utilities for this motherboard are for
Windows or DOS).  You won't find any serial port on this motherboard,
so if you need support for older hardware, you have to pick up a
separate card.  There also is no floppy drive.
</p><p>
The ASUS A8N-SLI Premium offers support for AMD Cool 'n' Quiet
Technology, which adjusts the CPU speed, voltage and power consumption,
depending on what the system is doing.  Although this motherboard is more
than
a year old, its feature collection is still impressive, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
HyperTransport Technology (<a href="http://www.hypertransport.org" target="_self">www.hypertransport.org</a>), which speeds
up communication between integrated motherboard components.
</p></li><li><p>
Dual-channel DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM.
</p></li><li><p>
Serial ATA (SATA) II hard drive interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Dual RAID controllers.
</p></li><li><p>
PCI Express controllers.
</p></li><li><p>
S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface) Out to allow digital-to-digital
transfer of audio between devices.
</p></li><li><p>
IEEE 1394a (FireWire), which is now supported under Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
USB 2.0 connectors.
</p></li><li><p>
Two Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For RAM, this box has two Corsair XMS CMX1024-3200C2 PC3200 1,024MB
low-latency sticks.  The XMS (Xtreme Memory) product line from Corsair is
designed for overclockers and gamers.  Rather than choosing the flashy
option of the RAM sticks with the LED displays along their tops, Puget
Custom Systems went with the less-flashy (and therefore less-expensive)
option.  We were hoping for fast memory, so this is a real plus&mdash;and we
encouraged vendors to go more for practical than &ldquo;bling&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The included hard drive is the Western Digital SATA Raptor 74GB.  This
drive might be a bit small for what many people want, but you can choose
another size if you want a bigger one&mdash;and are willing to pay more for
it.  However, this hard drive is 10,000 RPM, so it flies when it's in use.
</p><p>
When it comes to the video cards, specifically what's included are two
eVGA 7900GT CO 256MB SLI cards.  These aren't the highest model available
for eVGA's NVIDIA 7900 series cards, but again, you can customize the
order to go up to the GTX if you want to spend around $1,000 US more on your
computer to get the bleeding edge.
</p><p>
One small drawback may be the Seasonic S12 Series 500W power supply.  If
you want to add many more components to this system, you'll want to
upgrade to a larger wattage.  On the plus side though, this power supply
series is extremely quiet and has split rail technology, meaning that
the various devices on your system are all drawing their power from,
in a way, multiple smaller power supplies.  This feature prevents devices
from interfering with each other.  On an SLI system, you definitely want
this feature in your power supply.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeff580.0xff83c8"></a>
Keeping Cool</h2></div></div><p>
Everyone has heard about things like people being able to cook inside
modern computers.  If you've run into problems with intermittent crashes
while playing high-end games, you also know the pain of video
cards and other components that overheat.  Although we would have loved a
liquid-cooled box, and they will build you one, it can add more than $1,000 US to
the price.  Without liquid cooling, however, Puget Custom Systems still
provides a machine where much thought was put into how to keep it from
overheating (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9057f2.large.jpg"><img src="9057f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Part of the Cooling Setup for the Ultimate Linux Desktop
</p></div></div><p>
First, there's the Swiftech MCX159-CU Chipset Cooler.  It's
a small heat sink and fan that is sandwiched, in this case, between
the two video cards (top left).  Then, there's the monster Thermalright
XP-90 Heatsink with 92mm Papst Fan, which is attached to the CPU (bottom
middle).  This particular solution is a combination fan, a set of
radiating fins and a set of heat-conducting pipes that can radiate
as well.  There's another fan bolted into a metal frame (upper right)
to help cool the video cards as well, and there's a heat exhaust fan
(bottom right) to blow hot air out of the case.  Not shown in Figure 2
is another fan for air intake at the front of the case.
</p><p>
The case's design also helps keep the system cool (Figure
3).  This Lian-Li V1000B Mid-Tower case is broken into three compartments:
one for the hard drives (lower left), one for the power supply (bottom
right) and then the upper compartment for the rest of the system.  This
breakdown creates three separate cooling zones, using small slots to
pass cables through without letting too much heat travel within the
machine as well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9057f3.large.jpg"><img src="9057f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The other part of the cooling setup is the actual case layout.
</p></div></div><p>
Many spots on the outside of the case are made of
a metallic mesh, allowing heat to pass through easily.  You would think
that such a setup would make the machine noisy, but in fact, this is a
fairly quiet system, mostly because the fans are so large.  The bigger
the fan, the quieter it tends to be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeff580.0xff8948"></a>
Other Fun Features</h2></div></div><p>
Within the case, as you can see in Figure 3, the cables are wonderfully
managed so that the computer doesn't look like someone dropped a bunch
of spaghetti into it.  The hard drive is installed in the lower left,
sideways so you can easily access the important areas&mdash;not to mention
making it far simpler to pull a drive out or push it in without
banging it against other important components.
</p><p>
The front panel (Figure 4) offers a power button (the big silver
disc), audio jacks, two USB ports and a FireWire port.  If you've
ever had to crawl around under desks to get to the back of a machine just to
plug in your USB thumbdrive, you know what a pain that can be.  Of course,
if you keep this case on the floor, you'll still have to get onto the
floor to access these controls, but it's better than having to go around
to the back.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9057f4.large.jpg"><img src="9057f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The front panel is along the bottom of the machine.  You
also can see the mesh mentioned earlier.
</p></div></div><p>
On the back panel (Figure 5), you can see at the top the connectors
for both video cards.  Below and on the right are the 5.1 analog
audio connectors, the two Gigabit Ethernet jacks, four USB ports, a
FireWire port, a parallel port, PS/2 mouse and keyboard jacks, and both
coaxial and optical S/PDIF jacks for digital audio and features, such as
5.1 surround sound.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9057f5.large.jpg"><img src="9057f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The back panel offers most of the hookups, along with many
spots for ventilation, including mesh and cut-outs for fans.
</p></div></div><p>
One of the perhaps smallest, but most wonderful features of the case
is the single screw lock mechanism for removing the side panel.  You
simply
have to twist one large screw by hand (no tools needed) to unlock the
panel and pull the panel off.  That's it.  Then to put it back, slide
the panel into place and re-lock the screw.
</p><p>
You also receive a box containing all of the unused parts and bits
that came with the hardware included in the machine.  There's a sheet that
shows where many of the components plug in to the back.  There's also a
sheet showing you the warranty information for any components that offer
them, and this particular box came with a one-year warranty as well.  In
the box, I also found all of the manuals and CDs involved in the process,
including a DVD of Fedora Core 5 (more about that in a moment).
</p><p>
This is ultimately a practical machine for today, and today's games
in particular, hitting all of the best price points.  However, if you
are especially into games, you might prefer to push further into the
bleeding edge and higher costs so you won't have to upgrade any time
soon.  The flexibility of Puget's customization interface&mdash;and the fact
that if you ask them to add something to the machine that isn't available
on their official list, they'll do so&mdash;should take care of those users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xeff580.0x13f11c8"></a>
The Ultimate Linux Desktop, and Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The box arrived with 32-bit Fedora Core 5 pre-installed.  SLI
was enabled, as verified in the X server logs.  The collection of yum
repositories recommended by FedoraFAQ.org were in place as well.  Flash
wasn't installed, but it was a minor annoyance because the repository was
already set up.  Other than that, everything worked like a charm under
both an older 17" CRT monitor and a newer 24" wide-screen LCD.
</p><p>
To check out the performance under pressure, I tried both <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unreal
Tournament 2004</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 4</em></span>.  Both of these games played smoothly with
the absolute highest video resolutions and effects settings.  In fact,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake 4</em></span> was set to 16x anti-aliasing with anisotropic filtering and
1920x1200 resolution and still played perfectly smoothly.
</p><p>
They have the firewall on with SSH enabled by default, which is a
sane option.  SELinux is on as well, so users would have to go out of
their way to unsecure the machine.  I can't think of any real complaints
here aside from Flash.  The system worked out of the box with Linux in
place.  Mind you, the installation was 32-bit instead of 64-bit.  I could
only speculate as to why at this point, so I won't make wild
guesses&mdash;and
I'm sure if I had specifically asked them to install 64-bit, they
would have done so.
</p><p>
Really, other than that it just worked, and worked well; you can't ask
for more than that from the Ultimate Linux Desktop.
