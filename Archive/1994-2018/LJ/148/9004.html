Hole punching is a possible solution to solving the NAT problem for P2P
protocols.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1530580.0x16282f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Network address translators (NATs) are something every software
engineer has heard of, not to mention networking professionals.  NAT has
become as ubiquitous as the Cisco router in networking terms.
</p><p>
Fundamentally, a NAT device allows multiple machines to communicate with
the Internet using a single globally unique IP address, effectively
solving the scarce IPv4 address space problem.  Though not a long-term
solution, as originally envisaged in 1994, for better or worse, NAT
technology is here to stay, even when IPv6 addresses become common.  This
is partly
because IPv6 has to coexist with IPv4, and one of the ways to achieve
that is by using NAT technology.
</p><p>
This article is not so much a description of
how a NAT works.  There already is an excellent article on this subject by
Geoff Huston (see the on-line Resources).
It is quite comprehensive, though plenty of other resources are available on
the Internet as well.
</p><p>
This article discusses a possible solution to solving
the NAT problem for P2P protocols.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1530580.0x1628500"></a>
What Is Wrong with NAT? </h2></div></div><p>
NAT breaks the Internet more than it makes it.  I may sound harsh here,
but ask any peer-to-peer application developer, especially the VoIP
folks,
and they will tell you why.
</p><p>
For instance, you never can do Web hosting behind a NAT device.  At least,
not without sufficient tweaking.  Not only that, you cannot run any service
such as FTP or rsync or any public service through a NAT device.  This can
be solved by obtaining a globally unique IP address and configuring the
NAT device to bypass traffic originating from that particular IP.
</p><p>
But, the particularly hairy issue with NATed IP addresses is that you
can't access machines behind a NAT, simply because you won't even know that
a NAT exists in between.  By and large, NAT is designed to be
transparent, and it remains so.  Even if you know there is a NAT device, NAT will let traffic reach the appropriate private IP only
if there is mapping between the private IP/TCP or UDP port number
with the NAT's public IP/TCP or UDP port number.  And, this mapping
is created only when traffic originates from the private IP to the
Internet&mdash;not vice versa.
</p><p>
To make things more complicated, NAT simply drops all unsolicited
traffic coming from the Internet to the private hosts.  Though this
feature arguably adds a certain degree of security through obscurity,
it creates more problems than it solves, at least from the perspective
of the future of the Internet.
</p><p>
At least 50% of the most commonly used networking applications use
peer-to-peer technology.  Common examples include instant messaging
protocols,
VoIP applications, such as Skype, and the
BitTorrent download accelerator.  In fact, peer-to-peer traffic is only
going to increase as time progresses, because the Internet has a lot more to offer
beyond the traditional client/server paradigm.
</p><p>
Peer-to-peer technology, by definition, is a mesh network as opposed to
a star network in a client/server model.  In a peer-to-peer network, all
nodes act simultaneously as client and server.  This already
leads to programming complexity, and peer-to-peer nodes
also have to deal somehow with the problematic NAT devices in between.
</p><p>
To make things even more difficult for P2P application developers,
there is no standardized NAT behavior.  Different NAT devices behave
differently.  But, the silver lining is that a large portion of the
NAT devices in existence today still behave sensibly enough at least to
let peer-to-peer UDP traffic pass through.
</p><p>
Sending TCP traffic across a NAT device also has met with success, though
you may not be as lucky as with UDP.  In this article, we focus purely
on UDP, because TCP NAT traversal still remains rather tricky.  UDP
NAT traversal also is not completely reliable across all NAT devices, but
things are very encouraging now and will continue to get better
as NAT vendors wake up to the need for supporting P2P protocols.
</p><p>
Incidentally, voice traffic is better handled by UDP, so that suits us
fine.  Now that we have a fairly good idea of the problem we are
trying to solve, let's get down to the solution.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1530580.0x16288c8"></a>
Anatomy of the Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The key to the NAT puzzle lies in the fact that in order for machines
behind a NAT gateway to interact with the public Internet, NAT devices
necessarily have to allow inbound traffic&mdash;that is, replies to requests
originating from behind the NAT device.  In other words, NAT devices let
traffic through to a particular host behind a NAT device, provided the
traffic is indeed a reply to a request sent by the NAT device.  Now,
as mentioned above, NAT devices vary widely in operation, and they let
through replies coming from other hosts and port numbers,
depending on their own notion of what a reply means.
</p><p>
Our job is simple if we understand this much&mdash;that instead of
connecting directly to the host behind NAT, we somehow need to mimic a scenario in
which the target host originates a connection to us and then we connect
to it as though we are responding to the request.  In other words, our
connection request to the target host should seem like a reply to the
NAT device.
</p><p>
It turns out that this technique is easy to achieve using a method now
widely known as UDP hole punching.  Contrary to what the name suggests,
this does not leave a gaping security hole or anything of the sort; it
is simply a perfectly sensible and effective way to solve the NAT problem
for peer-to-peer protocols.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, what UDP hole punching does already has been explained.  Now
if it were only that, life would be too simple, and you would not be
reading this article.  As it turns out, there are plenty of obstacles on
the way, but none of them are too complicated.
</p><p>
First is the issue of how to get the private
host to originate traffic so we can send our connection request to
it masquerading as a reply.  To make things worse, NAT devices
also have an idle timer, typically of around 60 seconds, such that they stop waiting for replies once a request originates and no reply comes within
60 seconds.  So, it is not enough that the private host originate
traffic, but also we have to act fast&mdash;we have to send the
&ldquo;reply&rdquo;
before the NAT device removes the &ldquo;association&rdquo; with the
private host,
which will frustrate our connection attempt.
</p><p>
Now, a reply obviously has to come from the original machine to which
the request was sent.  This suits us fine if we are not behind another
NAT device.  So, if we want to talk to a private IP, we make the
private IP send a packet to us, and we send our connection request
as a reply to it.  But, how do we inform the private IP to send a packet
to us when we want to talk to it?
</p><p>
If both the peer-to-peer hosts are behind different NAT devices,
is it possible at all to communicate with each other? Fortunately, it is
possible.
</p><p>
It turns out that NAT devices are somewhat forgiving, and they differ in
their levels of leniency when it comes to interpreting what they consider
as reply to a request.
There are different varieties of NAT behavior:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Full cone NAT
</p></li><li><p>
Restricted cone NAT
</p></li><li><p>
Restricted port NAT
</p></li><li><p>
Symmetric NAT
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I won't go into the details and definitions of these here, as there are numerous
resources explaining them elsewhere.  Symmetric NATs are the most formidable
enemy for P2P applications.  However, with a degree of cleverness, we can
reasonably &ldquo;guess&rdquo; the symmetric NAT behavior and deal with
it&mdash;well, not
all symmetric NATs, but many of them can be tamed to allow P2P protocols.
</p><p>
First, how do we tell the private IP that we are interested
in connecting to it at a particular instance?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1530580.0x1629108"></a>
Implementation Details of the UDP Hole Punching Technique</h2></div></div><p>
This problem can be solved by joining the problem, rather than
fighting it head on.  In order to achieve peer-to-peer
traffic across NATs, we have to modify our P2P mesh model slightly to
make it a hybrid of a traditional star model and modern mesh model.
</p><p>
So, we introduce the concept of a rendezvous server, or mediator server,
which listens on a globally routable IP address.  Almost all peer-to-peer
protocols have traditionally relied on certain supernodes, or in other
words, in P2P, all nodes are equal but some are more equal.  Some nodes
always have acted as key players in any P2P protocol.  If you have heard
of a BitTorrent tracker, you know what I mean.
</p><p>
A rendezvous concept is nothing new in the P2P world, nor is the star
model totally done away with in P2P.
</p><p>
Coming back to our original NAT problem, private IPs obviously can browse
the Internet through NAT devices, and thus they can talk HTTP through
port 80 or through a proxy HTTP port over TCP.  So private IPs can almost
always open TCP connections to global IP addresses.  We use this fact to
make the private IP connect to a mediator or rendezvous server through TCP.
</p><p>
Our solution relies on the fact that all the P2P nodes are constantly in
touch with a rendezvous server, listening on a global IP address through
a persistent TCP connection.  Remember that P2P nodes are both client
and server at the same time, so they can originate connections as well
as serve connection requests simultaneously.
</p><p>
It is through this TCP connection that we inform a particular P2P node that
another node wants to talk to it.  Then, the target node sends a request
following which the peer sends the connection request as a response to
the request.
</p><p>
Because the
private machines behind a NAT device do not have a routable IP address,
the only way for us to access them from outside the NAT device is through
the mapping that the NAT device maintains for the machine to talk to
the external world.  For each connection originated from the private IP,
a unique port is assigned at the NAT device.  For us to talk to the private
IP, we have to send our packets to that particular port assigned for the
private IP's connection to the external world.  Now, we know that there
is no notion of connection in the UDP world, so NAT assumes that if a
reply doesn't come for a UDP request in about 60 seconds, the connection
is deemed non-existent and closed.
</p><p>
So now we have another problem&mdash;that of determining the port assigned
at the NAT's public interface for the private IP connection.  This can
be inferred by inspecting the source address of the UDP datagram that
reaches any global IP.
</p><p>
So far so good.  If we are not behind NAT, we can use the previously mentioned
technique to initiate communication with a private IP using the rendezvous
server.
</p><p>
However, reality tells us that
P2P peers are more likely to be behind a NAT than otherwise.  So, this
solution is
not enough.  We want to initiate a P2P connection from behind a
NAT device ourselves.  So, now we have two NAT devices in the picture,
one behind each P2P node.
</p><p>
Now the real fun begins.  First, let's redefine our goal in the light of
this new twist to the problem and attack it step by step.  What we want
to do now is use the rendezvous server and inform the
target P2P node to send us a request, but we are behind a NAT.
</p><p>
So, for any external party to talk to us, we should have a global IP/port
combo that exists at the NAT public interface.  First we have
to create one for ourselves.  Only then we can receive communication
requests coming from outside the NAT network.
</p><p>
We can create a mapping for us by sending a packet to a global IP.  The
global IP can then figure out our mapping by inspecting the from
address.  But how do we inform our P2P node of this address? For that we
can use the TCP connection with the rendezvous machine.  But,
only the global IP to which we send the packet knows our association,
so how do we figure that out? It's simple.  The global IP can send that information
to us as a reply in the packet payload to us.
</p><p>
Assuming that we somehow obtain a public IP, port pair and figure
that out, we tell the mediator that we are listening at that public
IP/port pair and request the P2P target node to initiate a request to
us.  Subsequently, we can connect to it as a reply to that message.
</p><p>
But, then we cannot receive packets from the P2P target node, because NAT
is not expecting a reply from that global IP.  In fact, some NATs that show full cone
behavior allow packets to come from any IP, but most NATs do not&mdash;back
to square one.
</p><p>
Consider this: if both P2P nodes behind the NAT send packets to each other's
public IP/port, the first packet from each party is discarded because
it was unsolicited.  But subsequent packets are let through because NAT
thinks the packets are replies to our original request.  And voil&agrave;
the hole is punched, and UDP traffic can pass through directly between
the P2P nodes.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, NATs also differ in their behavior of assigning public
ports for different destination IPs.   Most NAT devices fortunately do
not change public ports between requests to different destination IPs,
so we can safely assume that.
</p><p>
So first we send certain probe or discovery packets to two different
IPs and figure out the behavior of the NAT.  If it is found to be
consistent, our approach will work. In the unlikely case that we bump
into symmetric NAT behavior that varies the port between requests,
we can figure out the delta by which the port number varies.  And, using
this we can guess the port assigned for a particular request.
</p><p>
The reason we are so particular about this is because the first packet
to our P2P destination behind NAT is dropped by NAT.  So, all we can do
is guess.  In practice, however, it works fairly well.  This is why it is
important that the P2P nodes keep the source and the destination ports
the same for communication.
</p><p>
Once this hole punching procedure is performed, the two P2P nodes
can communicate with each other without the help of
the rendezvous machine.  So the rendezvous machine is useful only for
informing a P2P node about an incoming connection and informing each of
the communicating peers about each other's public addresses.
Subsequently,
the communication happens directly without the intervention of the
rendezvous server.
</p><p>
Now we have to apply some ingenuity and introduce appropriate headers
in the packets to inform the peer whether it is sending a reply meant
for the P2P client or whether it is sending a request meant for the
P2P server.  Once we are able to differentiate between the two, we are
set.  We also need to differentiate between hole punching traffic and
regular traffic, because hole punching traffic needs to be bounced, and
regular traffic needs to be processed.
</p><p>
Of course, if we stop sending and receiving, the association at the
NAT device at both ends will expire.  So we either can send keepalive
traffic or rerun the hole punching technique.  You can choose whichever
technique is suitable depending upon your needs.
</p><p>
This technique will not work if both the P2P nodes are behind the same
NAT device.  So, we also have to figure out whether we can communicate
directly using the private IP address itself.  Thus, our hole punching has
to try the private interface along with the peer's public interface.  And,
it can happen that our private network has the same private IP as the
peer's private IP.  So we have to guard against getting spurious responses.
</p><p>
It also can happen that another P2P node in the same private network
as ours has the same private IP as the P2P node we want to talk to
in another private network.  Then we have to do additional validation
against the peer's identity to make sure we really are talking to
the interested node.
</p><p>
In the unlikely case that you run into brain-damaged NAT devices at both ends,
this technique obviously will fail, because we should be able to predict
the public address assigned to us.  In that situation, the only way is
to make the rendezvous server act as a relay for the traffic.  So
peer-to-peer traffic goes through, but it is no longer peer to peer with the
rendezvous machine acting as server.  If you run into such situations,
you need to think of implementing that as well.

Now, for the Real Dope, the C Code for Achieving the above</h2></div></div><p>
Due to their long length, the listings for this article are located on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site at <a href="../listings/148/9004.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue148/9004.tgz</a>.  I leave out
unnecessary detail and glue code and
focus purely on the nontrivial aspects of UDP hole punching.
</p><p>
If you need more information on implementing your own hole punching
library, you always can refer to the above design constraints and design
a solution appropriately.
</p><p>
Please note that I have consciously left out the rfcs and NAT discovery
techniques, such as STUN and frameworks like ICE.  UDP hole
punching is already complicated, and we don't gain anything by making
it even more bloated without adding any real value.  So, the technique as it
stands works as good or even better than other NAT traversal mechanisms.
</p><p>
First, take a look at the rendezvous code (Listing 1).  Note that we use select() to serve
multiple sockets.  We could as well use kqueue() on *BSD, or better,
use the libevent abstraction (see Resources).  But, I stuck to select()
because performance doesn't matter so much to us.  We talk to the mediator
server only for establishing peer-to-peer connections, not otherwise.
</p><p>
The hole punching implementation is given in Listing 2 and the P2P client
in Listing 3.
</p><p>
Using this method, you should be able to develop your own peer-to-peer
protocol.  You easily can develop your own instant messaging protocol
along with some GUI code.
You can transfer files either using nc or using code for that
directly.  You can develop certain applications, such as transferring voice
via a microphone and speaker.  In other words, you can develop
a hobby VoIP application with this.
</p><p>
Several possibilities exist.  You can add some reliability on top of
UDP in case you are paranoid about your data reaching you safely.
</p><p>
One very useful tool that helped me immensely in this endeavor is the
Network Swiss-Army knife, netcat.
</p><p>
You can see hole punching in action by using this simple command.  At each
end, type:

      <pre     class="programlisting">
      
      $ nc -u -p 17000 &lt;peer public IP&gt; 17000
      
      </pre>
</p><p>
With only the peer public IP different, you can start communicating if
you are lucky, because most NAT devices try to assign the same private
port as the public port.
</p><p>
If you want to test TCP hole punching, try this:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
         $nc -l -p 17000
      </pre><p>
at one end and this:

      <pre     class="programlisting">
      
      $nc -p 17000 &lt;peer public IP&gt; 17000
      
      </pre>

at the other end.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1530580.0x1a22328"></a>
Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
Rather than having one rendezvous server, you can have a few of them for
failover and geographical distribution.
However, if you are behind two levels of NAT, sometimes this may not work.
You also could listen on multiple virtual and real interfaces and attempt
hole punching on all of them.
You can add TCP hole punching on similar lines and try that first,
and then attempt UDP hole punching.
