Writing a Facebook application means integrating your database with
information kept on Facebook. Here's how you can combine the two
quickly and easily.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a16580.0x2b0e348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the past few months, we've been looking at the Facebook API,
which makes it possible to integrate third-party applications 
into the popular social-networking site. Facebook is remarkable to
users for the number of people already using it, as well as for the rapid
pace at which new people are joining. But, it also is remarkable for
software developers, who suddenly have been given access to a large
number of users, into whose day-to-day Web experience they can add
their own applications.
</p><p>
The nature of Facebook means that most developers are writing
applications that are more frivolous than not. Thus, it's easy to find
name-that-celebrity games, extensions to built-in Facebook
functionality (such as, &ldquo;SuperWall&rdquo;) and various applications that ask
questions, match people together and so forth. I expect we 
eventually will see some more serious applications created with the
Facebook API, but that depends on the developer
community. I would argue that the continued growth of Facebook
applications depends on the ability of developers to profit from their
work, but that is a business issue, rather than a technical one.
</p><p>
Regardless of what your application does, it probably will be quite
boring if you cannot keep track of information about your users.
This might strike you as strange&mdash;after all, if you are writing a
Facebook application, shouldn't Facebook take care of the storage
for you?
</p><p>
The answer is no. Although Facebook handles user authentication, gives
you the ability to deploy your application within the Facebook site
and even provides access to certain data about the currently
logged-in user, it does not store data on your behalf. This means
any data you want to store must be kept on your own server, in
your own database.
</p><p>
This month, I explain how to create a simple application on Facebook
that allows us to retrieve data from a user's Facebook
profile or from our local relational database seamlessly. The key to this 
is the user's Facebook ID, which we will integrate into our own user
database. Retrieving information about our user, or about any of
their friends, will require a bit of thinking about where the
data is stored. However, you will soon see that mixing data from
different sources is not as difficult as it might sound at first, and
it can lead to far more interesting applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a16580.0x2b0e710"></a>
Creating the Application</h2></div></div><p>
Our application is going to be simple&mdash;a Facebook version of the
famous &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; program that is the first lesson in oh-so-many
books and classes. However, we'll add two simple twists: first, we
will display the number of times that the user has visited our
application to date. (So, on your fifth visit, you will be reminded
that this is your fifth visit.) Moreover, you will be told how many
times each of your friends has visited the site.
</p><p>
In a normal Web/database application, this would be quite
straightforward. First, we would define a database to keep track
of users, friends and visits. Then, we would write some code to keep
track of logins. Finally, we would create a page that displayed the
result of a join between the various pages to show when people had
last visited. For example, we could structure our database tables
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

CREATE TABLE People (
    id    SERIAL    NOT NULL,
    email_address    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    encrypted_password    TEXT    NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    UNIQUE(email_address)
);

CREATE TABLE Visits (
    person_id    INTEGER    NOT NULL  REFERENCES People,
    visited_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL    DEFAULT NOW(),

    UNIQUE(person_id, visited_at)
);

CREATE TABLE Friends (
    person_id    INTEGER    NOT NULL  REFERENCES People,
    friend_id    INTEGER     NOT NULL  REFERENCES People,

    UNIQUE(person_id, friend_id),
    CHECK(person_id &lt;&gt; friend_id)
);

</pre>
</p><p>
Our first table, People, contains only a small number of columns,
probably fewer than you would want in a real system. We keep track of
the users' primary key (id), their e-mail addresses (which double as
their login) and their encrypted passwords.
</p><p>
We keep track of each visit someone makes to our site in a
separate table. We don't need to do this; it would be a bit easier
and faster to have a number_of_visits column in the People table
and then just increment that with each visit. But, keeping track of
each visit means we have more flexibility in the future, from
collecting usage statistics to stopping people from using our system
too much.
</p><p>
Finally, we indicate friendship in our Friends table. Keeping track
of friends is a slightly tricky business, because you want to assume
that if A is a friend to B, then B also is a friend to A. We could do
this, but it's easier in my book simply to enter two rows in the
database, one for each direction. To retrieve the friends of A, whose
ID is 1, we look in the Friends table for all of the values of
friend_id where person_id = 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a16580.0x2b0ea28"></a>
Integrating with Facebook</h2></div></div><p>
All of this seems pretty reasonable and straightforward, and it isn't
hard to implement in any modern Web framework. But, if we want to
implement the same functionality in a Facebook application, we have to
consider that about half the database we just defined is going
to be unnecessary. We don't need to worry about the Friends table,
because that's something Facebook does quite well. And, we don't
really need to worry about the People table either, as Facebook
handles logins and authentication.
</p><p>
At the same time, we obviously can't use only the Friends table by
itself. We need it to point to something, somewhere, so we can
associate a visit with a user. How do we do that?
</p><p>
The answer is that instead of storing the users' information, we 
store their Facebook user IDs. Our People table, thus, will look like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id    SERIAL    NOT NULL,
    facebook_session_key    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    facebook_uid    TEXT    NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
By storing the Facebook information in our database, we effectively
hook our id column to what Facebook provides. But, how will we use
this link?
</p><p>
The answer is that we don't really have to, if we use a plugin that
handles the underlying details for us. I have used RFacebook for the
past few months; this is a plugin for Ruby on Rails that makes it
fairly easy to create a Facebook application using Rails. First, I
create my models using the generate script that comes with Rails:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate model person facebook_session_key:string
&#8618;facebook_uid:string
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a new model&mdash;that is, a Ruby class that represents a
database table&mdash;called person.rb. Although this script doesn't create
the model directly, it does create a migration file that defines our
database table in Ruby:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreatePeople &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.column :facebook_session_key, :string
      t.column :facebook_uid, :string
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :people
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Assuming that our database is all set up, we can run the migration
using the built-in rake tool (think make, but in Ruby):

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
The output tells us a bit of what's going on:


<pre     class="programlisting">
== CreatePeople: migrating ======================
-- create_table(:people)
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create
    implicit sequence "people_id_seq" for serial column "people.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create
    implicit index "people_pkey" for table "people"
 -&gt; 0.1939s
== CreatePeople: migrated (0.1944s) =============
</pre>
</p><p>
The advantage of using rake and migrations is that we can modify our
migrations file, change our database definitions, and move forward and
backward in time through our database design. Migrations mean that
you can keep track of your changes to the database and automatically
upgrade (or downgrade) the database to the latest version without
losing data. And, sure enough, if we look at our database, we see that
it has three columns, just as we defined.
</p><p>
Next, we create another model for our visits table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./script/generate model visit person_id:integer 
 &#8618;visited_at:timestamp
</pre>
</p><p>
We migrate the database to the latest version:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
And, sure enough, we have a visits table with a person_id column.
Unfortunately, because Rails migrations are written in a generic
language, there isn't any built-in support for handling foreign keys
and other referential integrity checks. So, the table, as we
defined it above, would have indicated that person_id always must point
to a value.
</p><p>
Also note that the default model-generation script allows null values.
We could go into the migration file and change this, but we will
ignore it for now.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a16580.0x2b0f2c0"></a>
Mixing It Together</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have a place for the Facebook information in our People
table, we need to tell Rails to put it there. We do this by adding
the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
acts_as_facebook_user
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a16580.0x2b0f420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in the model file, person.rb. By default, it will be almost empty,
indicating that we will use ActiveRecord's defaults to work with our
database table via Ruby:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
end

</pre>
</p><p>
When we're done, our class will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_facebook_user
end

</pre>
</p><p>
In our controller file (which I'm sneakily reusing from what we did
last month, modifying the facebook method in the hello
controller), I've modified the method to read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def facebook
  render :text =&gt; "hi"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Because my application is called rmlljatf, I can go to the following URL:
http://apps.facebook.com/rmlljatf/,
and see my &ldquo;hi&rdquo; at the top of the page. After loading this page, I
then look at my People table and find...that nothing has changed.
After all, I told the system to create the table, but I didn't
actually do anything with it! For that to happen, I need to use the
built-in fbsession object, which gives me access to Facebook
information. I then can say:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def facebook
  person = Person.find_or_create_by_facebook_session(fbsession)
  render :text =&gt; "hi"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
And, sure enough, reloading the page creates a row in our People table.
</p><p>
Next, I modify my method to add a row to our visits table. I can
do that with the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def facebook
  person = Person.find_or_create_by_facebook_session(fbsession)

  Visit.create(:person_id =&gt; person.id,
                      :visited_at =&gt; Time.now()).save!

  render :text =&gt; "hi"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Once I've modified the facebook method in this way, each visit to
the site does indeed add another row to the visits table.
</p><p>
Now we should produce some output, indicating exactly how many visits the
person has made to the site. For this, we create a view
(facebook.rhtml), which can display things more easily:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;This is your &lt;%= @number_of_visits.ordinalize %&gt; visit.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This short view displays the instance variable @number_of_visits
and puts it into ordinal form, which is convenient. However, this
means we need to set @number_of_visits in the facebook method.
We do this by adding the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
@number_of_visits =
  &#8618;Visit.count(:conditions =&gt; ["person_id = ?", person.id])
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, we grab the current user's ID. We then use that ID,
along with a built-in ActiveRecord value, to sum up the number of visits
the user has made to the site.
</p><p>
Finally, it's time to introduce the Facebook magic. We know, from
last month, that we can display the current user's Facebook friends
without too much trouble; we use fbsession to grab a list of friends
(and specific pieces of information about those friends), and then
iterate over them, displaying them however we like.
</p><p>
Now, we do the same thing, but we also create a hash,
@friends_visits, in which the key will be the Facebook user ID
(uid), and the value will be the number of visits by that person.
We give our hash a default value of 0, in case we try to retrieve
a key that does not exist. We also use a bit of exception
handling to ensure that we can handle null results. The final version of
the facebook method looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def facebook
  person = Person.find_or_create_by_facebook_session(fbsession)
  Visit.create(:person_id =&gt; person.id,
               :visited_at =&gt; Time.now())

  # Count the number of visits
  @number_of_visits =
    Visit.count(:conditions =&gt; ["person_id = ?", person.id])

  @friend_uids = fbsession.friends_get.uid_list

  # Get info about friends from Facebook
  @friends_info =
    fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids =&gt; @friend_uids,
                            :fields =&gt; ["first_name", "last_name"])

  # Keep track of friend visits to the site
  @friends_visits = Hash.new(0)
  @friends_info.user_list.each do |userInfo|
    begin
      friend = Person.find_by_facebook_uid(userInfo.uid)

      @friends_visits[userInfo.uid] =
        Visit.count(:conditions =&gt; ["person_id = ?", friend.id])
    rescue
      next
    end
  end

end
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, we grab friend information via fbsession. We then
iterate over each friend, getting its Facebook uid. With that
UID&mdash;which we have in our People table, in the facebook_uid
column&mdash;we
can get the person's database ID, and then use that to find the
person's number of visits.
</p><p>
With this in place, we can rewrite the view as follows to include
friend information:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;This is your &lt;%= @number_of_visits.ordinalize %&gt; visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% @friends_info.user_list.each do |userInfo| %&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;fb:name uid="&lt;%= userInfo.uid -%&gt;" target="_blank" /&gt;
            &lt;fb:profile-pic uid="&lt;%= userInfo.uid -%&gt;" linked="true" /&gt;
        &lt;%= @friends_visits[userInfo.uid] %&gt; visit(s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, when you visit the page, it tells you how many times you
have visited, as well as how many times each friend has visited.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Facebook's API gives us the opportunity to think about how we can
structure an application that doesn't have access to some of the
data. This application doesn't have any authentication information
about users, and it can get only particular pieces of data about them. But, because we have an id column, we can use it to store
data on our local server and then join that data with what
comes from Facebook seamlessly.
