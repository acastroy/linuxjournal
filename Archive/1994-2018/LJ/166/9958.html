Free Software Foundation's GNU Affero General Public License</h2></div></div><p>
Although not a product per se, the Free Software Foundation's (FSF's)
newly minted GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (GNU AGPLv3)
will affect many forthcoming works of software artisanship. Based on
version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GNU GPLv3), the new Affero
&ldquo;fork&rdquo; includes additional terms that allow users who interact with the
licensed software over a network to receive the source for that program.
With Affero, FSF seeks to foster user and development communities
around network-oriented free software. FSF claims that the GNU AGPL will
enable the same kind of massive collaboration among developers around
Web services and other networked software that the GNU GPL has fostered
over the years with non-networked applications.

eZ Systems' eZ Publish</h2></div></div><p>
Further boosting Norway's place in global open-source development,
eZ Systems recently released version 4.0 of eZ Publish, the company's
enterprise content management system. eZ Publish is an application for
creating Web sites, on-line stores, intranets and extranets. New features
in 4.0 include full PHP 5 compatibility, full support for using eZ
Components in plugins, improved internal XML handling and an updated Web
site interface. The product is available as either an out-of-the-box
or a tailor-made solution, depending on the varying needs of clients.
GPL'd Linux and Windows versions are available for download at eZ Systems'
Web site.

Perforce's Fast Software Configuration Management System &amp; SDK</h2></div></div><p>
Perforce wrapped up 2007 announcing a new version of its Fast Software
Configuration Management (SCM) System, Perforce 2007.3. SCM is an
application version lifecycle management (ALM) tool that versions and
manages source code and digital assets for enterprises of all sizes.
The most significant component of this release is the new SDK for the
Defect Tracking Gateway, which allows customers and vendors to develop
improved integrations to commercial and in-house tracking systems.
Perforce also claims an advantage from its ability to integrate with
other tools rather than being a one-stop shop, allowing customers to add
the project management and process automation tools of their choice.
A 45-day full version of Perforce with support and a free, two-user
version are available from the firm's Web site.

Fidelity National Information Services' FIS Profile</h2></div></div><p>
Fidelity National Information Services announced new performance
benchmarks on FIS Profile, its real-time technology solution for
the commercial and retail banking industry, now that it runs on Linux.
By running FIS Profile on Red Hat Linux Enterprise 5 and the HP ProLiant
DL580 G5 server platform with four Intel Quad-Core Xeon Series 7300
processors, the solution can manage a bank with 25 million accounts,
running core banking processes in real time on a single server.
Fidelity claims that the solution offers a tenfold improvement in
cost performance per account while maintaining the reliability and
security required by the commercial-banking industry. This solution is
intended to replace the mainframe-based systems for mid-tier banks that
were developed in the 1980s. Both Red Hat and Intel were involved in
developing the integrated platform.

AMCC's 3ware 9690SA Serial Attached SCSI RAID Controller</h2></div></div><p>
New in the SAS space is AMCC's 3ware 9690SA Serial Attached SCSI
(SAS) RAID Controller whose sales proposition includes the flexibility
offered by its three PCI Express low-profile controller choices: eight
internal ports, eight external ports or four internal/four external
ports. The 3ware 9690SA provides 2&ndash;24 ports of SATA connectivity and
maximized SAS expandability for up to 128 devices per controller. The
SAS controllers include AMCC's unified RAID management interface
and software suite, enabling a simplified configuration experience
irrespective of its storage interface. The product is destined for data-center environments needing expanded connectivity and high levels of
read and write performance. Targeted applications include databases,
NAS storage, Web servers, cluster servers, supercomputing, near-line
backup and archival, security systems and pro audio and video editing
appliances.

Cray Inc.'s XT5 Supercomputer Family</h2></div></div><p>
Cray Inc., progeny of the storied Cray Research, recently released its
XT5 family of Linux-based supercomputers. Cray says the XT5's massively
parallel processor (MPP) system includes a new eight-socket compute blade that
quadruples local memory capacity, doubles processor density and improves
energy efficiency. Other features include single-fan vertical cooling,
compute blades designed for optimal airflow and CPU configurations up
to 192 processor sockets or 768 CPU cores. To improve scalability, the
Cray XT5 family also includes the industry's first integrated hybrid
supercomputer, the Cray XT5<sup  >h</sup> system. The
XT5<sup  >h</sup> integrates multiple
processor architectures&mdash;including vector processors, GPUs, accelerators
and FPGAs&mdash;with a complete software development environment into a
single system supporting diverse work flows.

Appro's Xtreme-X Supercomputer Series</h2></div></div><p>
At Supercomputing 2007, Appro unveiled its forthcoming Xtreme-X
Supercomputer Series, a product line based on scalable clusters that
provide cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and scalability. The series
is designed to scale out data centers for medium- to large-scale enterprises
and HPC deployments. The first model in the series, the Appro Xtreme-X1,
will ship in the first half of 2008 and is based on dual-socket, Quad-Core
Intel Xeon processors. Besides its 128 nodes/512 processors and 6TF of
computing power in a single 42U equipment rack, the product has Appro's
new Directed Airflow cooling configuration, which the company says
will reduce data-center floor space by 30% while maximizing power and
cooling efficiency. In addition, the Xtreme-X1 features redundant (Dual
Rail) InfiniBand connections with low-latency Mellanox ConnectX host
channel adapters and Ethernet management fabric and network switches,
with all critical components being easily accessible, hot-swappable
and redundant.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em></span> by Jon Erickson (No
Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
No Starch Press continues its tradition of naughty geek entertainment with
the 2nd edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacking: The Art of Exploitation</em></span> by Jon Erickson.
Although other books in this genre show not only how to run other
people's exploits but also how to perform and write them on your own,
Erickson uses examples to illustrate the most common computer
security issues in three related fields: programming, networking and
cryptography. Some examples include stack-based overflows, heap-based
overflows, string exploits, return-into-libc, shellcode and cryptographic
attacks on 802.11x. A live Linux CD also is included.
