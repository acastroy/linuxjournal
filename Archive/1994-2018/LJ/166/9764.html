Virtualization has made a lot of progress during the last decade,
primarily due to the development of myriad open-source virtual machine
hypervisors. This progress has almost eliminated the barriers between
operating systems and dramatically increased utilization of powerful
servers, bringing immediate benefit to companies. Up until recently, the
focus always has been on software-emulated virtualization. Two of
the most common approaches to software-emulated virtualization are full
virtualization and paravirtualization. In full virtualization, a layer,
commonly called the hypervisor or the virtual machine monitor, exists
between the virtualized operating systems and the hardware. This layer
multiplexes the system resources between competing operating system
instances. Paravirtualization is different in that the hypervisor
operates in a more cooperative fashion, because each guest operating
system is aware that it is running in a virtualized environment, so each
cooperates with the hypervisor to virtualize the underlying hardware.
</p><p>
Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The primary advantage
of the paravirtualization approach is that it allows the fastest
possible software-based virtualization, at the cost of not supporting
proprietary operating systems. Full virtualization approaches, of course,
do not have this limitation; however, full virtualization hypervisors are
very complex pieces of software. VMware, the commercial virtualization
solution, is an example of full virtualization. Paravirtualization
is provided by Xen, User-Mode Linux (UML) and others.
</p><p>
With the introduction of hardware-based virtualization, these lines
have blurred. With the advent of Intel's VT and AMD's SVM, writing a
hypervisor has become significantly easier, and it now is possible to
enjoy the benefits of full virtualization while keeping the hypervisor's
complexity at a minimum.
</p><p>
Xen, the classic paravirtualization engine, now supports fully
virtualized MS Windows, with the help
of hardware-based virtualization. KVM is a relatively new and simple, yet
powerful, virtualization
engine, which has found its way into the Linux kernel,
giving the Linux kernel native virtualization capabilities. Because KVM
uses hardware-based virtualization, it does not require modified guest
operating systems, and thus, it can support any platform from within Linux,
given that it is deployed on a supported processor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b40580.0x1c38500"></a>
KVM</h2></div></div><p>
KVM is a unique hypervisor. The KVM developers, instead of creating
major portions of an operating system kernel themselves, as other
hypervisors have done, devised a method that turned the Linux kernel
itself into a hypervisor. This was achieved through a minimally intrusive
method by developing KVM as kernel module. Integrating the hypervisor
capabilities into a host Linux kernel as a loadable module can simplify
management and improve performance in virtualized environments. This
probably was the main reason for developers to add KVM to
the Linux kernel.
</p><p>
This approach has numerous advantages. By adding virtualization
capabilities to a standard Linux kernel, the virtualized environment
can benefit from all the ongoing work on the Linux kernel itself. Under
this model, every virtual machine is a regular Linux process, scheduled
by the standard Linux scheduler. Traditionally, a normal Linux process
has two modes of execution: kernel and user. The user mode is
the default mode for applications, and an application goes into kernel
mode when it requires some service from the kernel, such as writing to the
hard disk. KVM adds a third mode, the guest mode. Guest mode processes are
processes that are run from within the virtual machine. The guest
mode, just like the normal mode (non-virtualized instance), has its own
kernel and user-space variations. Normal kill and ps commands work on guest
modes. From the non-virtualized instance, a KVM virtual machine is shown
as a normal process, and it can be killed just like any other process. KVM makes use of
hardware virtualization to virtualize processor states, and memory management
for the virtual machine is handled from within the kernel. I/O in the
current version is handled in user space, primarily through QEMU.
</p><p>
A typical KVM installation consists of the following components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A device driver for managing the virtualization hardware; this driver
exposes its capabilities via a character device /dev/kvm.
</p></li><li><p>
A user-space component for emulating PC hardware; currently, this is
handled in the user space and is a lightly modified QEMU process.
</p></li><li><p>
The I/O model is directly derived from QEMU's, with support for
copy-on-write disk images and other QEMU features.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
How do you find out whether your system will run KVM? First, you need a
processor that supports virtualization. For a more detailed list, have
a look at <a href="http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/HVM_Compatible_Processors" target="_self">wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/HVM_Compatible_Processors</a>.
Additionally, you can check /proc/cpuinfo, and if you see vmx or smx in the
cpu flags field, your system supports KVM.

How KVM Compares to Existing Hypervisors</h2></div></div><p>
KVM is a fairly recent project compared with its competitors. In an
interview with Avi Kivity, the main developer, he compared KVM with
alternative solutions:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In many ways, VMware is a ground-breaking technology. VMware manages to
fully virtualize the notoriously complex x86 architecture using software
techniques only, and to achieve very good performance and stability. As
a result, VMware is a very large and complex piece of software. KVM, on
the other hand, relies on the new hardware virtualization technologies
that have appeared recently. As such, it is very small (about 10,000
lines) and relatively simple. Another big difference is that VMware is
proprietary, while KVM is open source.
</p><p>
Xen is a fairly large project, providing both paravirtualization and
full virtualization. It is designed as a standalone kernel, which only
requires Linux to perform I/O. This makes it rather large, as it has its
own scheduler, memory manager, timer handling and machine initialization.
</p><p>
KVM, in contrast, uses the standard Linux scheduler, memory management
and other services. This allows the KVM developers to concentrate on
virtualization, building on the core kernel instead of replacing it.
</p><p>
QEMU is a user-space emulator. It is a fairly amazing project, emulating
a variety of guest processors on several host processors, with fairly
decent performance. However, the user-space architecture does not allow
it to approach native speeds without a kernel accelerator. KVM recognizes
the utility of QEMU by using it for I/O hardware emulation. Although KVM
is not tied to any particular user space, the QEMU code was too good not
to use&mdash;so we used it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
KVM, however, is not perfect due to its newness; it has some
limitations including the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
At the time of this writing, KVM supports only Intel and AMD
virtualization, whereas
Xen supports IBM PowerPC and Itanium as well.
</p></li><li><p>
SMP support for hosts is lacking in the current release.
</p></li><li><p>
Performance tuning.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
However, the project is continuing at a rapid pace, and according to
Avi Kivity, KVM already is further ahead than Xen in some areas and surely will 
catch up in other areas in the future.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b40580.0x1c39058"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
How Virtualization Works</b></p><p>
Platform virtualization is an old technology; however, in recent years,
the hardware and operating systems have matured to the point of making
the promise of virtualization a reality. The most fundamental part of
virtualization is the hypervisor. The hypervisor acts as a layer between
the virtualized guest operating system and the real hardware. In some
cases, the hypervisor is an operating system, such as with Xen; in other
cases, it's user-level software, such as VMware. The virtualized guest
operating system, or the virtualized instance, is an isolated operating
system that views the underlying hardware platform as belonging to
it. But, in reality, the hypervisor provides it with this illusion.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Processor Support for Virtualization</b></span>
</p><p>
Due to the resurgence of interest in virtualization technology,
microprocessor manufacturers have updated their processors to have
native support for virtualization. Doing so allows the processor
to support a hypervisor directly and simplifies the task of writing
hypervisors, as is the case with KVM. The processor manages the processor
states for the host and guest operating systems, and it also manages the
I/O and interrupts on behalf of the virtualized operating system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b40580.0x1c39370"></a>
Installing KVM</h2></div></div><p>
KVM has been added to many distribution-specific repositories, 
including OpenSUSE/SUSE, Fedora 7 (which comes with KVM built-in),
Debian and Ubuntu (Feisty).
</p><p>
For other distributions, you need to download a kernel of version 2.6.20
and above. When compiling a custom kernel, select
Device Drivers&rarr;Virtualization when configuring the kernel, and
enable support for hardware-based virtualization. You also can get
the KVM module along with the required user-space utilities from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=180599" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=180599</a>.
</p><p>
I have installed the OpenSUSE packages; hence, filenames used in the
examples in this article may be different
from those in your release.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b40580.0x1c39580"></a>
Creating the Guest OS</h2></div></div><p>
Using the compiled kernel with virtualization support enabled, the next
step is to create a disk image for the guest operating system. You do
so with qemu-img, as shown below. Note that the size of the image is 6GB, but using QEMU's copy-on-write format (qcow), the file will grow as
needed, instead of occupying the full 6GB:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# qemu-img create -f qcow image.img 6G
</pre>
</p><p>
Instantiation of a new guest operating system is provided by a utility
called qemu-kvm. This utility works with the kvm module, using /dev/kvm
to load a guest, associate it with the virtual disk (a regular QEMU qcow
file in the host operating system), and then boot it. In some distributions
this utility may be called kvm.
</p><p>
With your virtual disk created, load the guest operating system into
it. The following example assumes that the guest operating system is
on a CD-ROM. In addition to populating the virtual disk with the CD-ROM
ISO image, you must boot the image when it's done:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# qemu-kvm -m 384 -cdrom guestos.iso -hda image.img -boot d
</pre>
</p><p>
The I/O in the current release of KVM is handled by QEMU, so let's
look at some important QEMU switches:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
-m: memory in terms of megabytes.
</p></li><li><p>
-cdrom: the file, ideally an ISO image, acts as a CD-ROM drive to the VM.
If no cdrom switch is specified, the ide1 master acts as the CD-ROM.
</p></li><li><p>
-hda: points to a QEMU copy-on-write image file. For more hard disks we
could specify:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#qemu-kvm -m 384 -hda vmdisk1.img -hdb vmdisk2.img -hdc vmdisk3.img
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
-boot: allows us to customize the boot options; the -d switch boots from
the CD-ROM.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The default command starts the guest OS in a subwindow, but you can
start in full-screen mode, by passing the following switch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-full-screen
</pre>
</p><p>
Additionally, KVM allows low-level control over the hardware of the
virtualized environment. You can redirect serial, parallel and
USB ports to specific devices by specifying the appropriate switches. Sound
in the VM is supported as well, and you can pass your sound card to the
VM via the -soundhw switch to enable sound.
</p><p>
The following are some keyboard shortcuts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Ctrl-Alt-F: toggle full screen.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-Alt-N: switch to virtual console N.
</p></li><li><p>
Ctrl-Alt: toggle mouse and keyboard.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b40580.0x1c308b8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
With the introduction of KVM into the Linux kernel, future Linux
distributions will have built-in support for virtualization, giving them
an edge over other operating systems. There will be no need for any
dual-boot installation in the future, because all the applications you
require could be run directly from the Linux desktop. KVM is just one more of
the many existing open-source hypervisors, reaffirming that open source
has been instrumental to the progress of virtualization technology.
