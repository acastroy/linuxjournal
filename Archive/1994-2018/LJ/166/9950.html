Virtualization is such a strange world, particularly when applied to an
otherwise, sometimes equally strange world.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2155580.0x224d3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Don't tell me, Fran&ccedil;ois. Let me guess. Okay, I give up. Tell me. Why
do you have all those wires coming out of your head? What do you mean you
are trying to create a virtual Fran&ccedil;ois? You think the transhumanists
are right, so you've decided to speed up the process by re-creating
yourself in your Linux system? Aside from the obvious jokes about one
of you being enough, I'm not sure this is really doable.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> Not
just you? You're trying to digitize the entire planet? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon
Dieu!</em></span>
Even if that were technically possible, we don't have anywhere near the
computing power in this restaurant to do such a thing, at least not on
the scale you are contemplating. At best, we can do a little global
desktop virtualization. There's no more time to talk about this now,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>; our guests will be here any moment. Look,
they are
approaching as we speak. Quickly, Fran&ccedil;ois, prepare the tables.
</p><p>
Hello, everyone, and welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. It is
here that
you will find the best in Linux and open-source software, guaranteed to
enhance your Linux experience, served with exceptional wines
to please and titillate your palate. My faithful waiter will provide us
with the wine momentarily. Fran&ccedil;ois! To the wine cellar. Over in the
south wing, you'll find three cases of 2005 Cloudy Bay Chardonnay from
New Zealand. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><p>
While he is off fetching the wine, I should tell you that Fran&ccedil;ois
has some aspirations that are somewhat loosely reflected in the software
you'll see today. He wants to create machine copies of all of us;
however, I think he'll have to settle for the world on his desktop.
</p><p>
Good to have you back, Fran&ccedil;ois. Please, pour for our guests. Enjoy,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>.
</p><p>
By now, you know that the new KDE 4 desktop has been released and with
it, there are some cool new applications. One of these, Torsten Rahn and
Inge Wallin's very cool Marble, is part of the KDE educational
suite. Some of you, like myself, may remember a kid's show that ran
from 1974 to 1983 called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Blue Marble</em></span> and the theme
song that
accompanied it&mdash;the opening line was &ldquo;The Earth's a Big Blue
Marble
when you see it from out there.&rdquo; Well, Marble is described as
&ldquo;a generic
geographical map widget and framework&rdquo; in the sense that it can be
used
by different KDE 4 applications, but to you and me, and for today's menu,
it's an interactive globe of the planet we live on and a 3-D atlas. As with
a physical globe, the Earth is represented as a sphere, and you can spin
it around, explore the surface and learn about our planet. It's a fast,
fun application (Figure 1), and
you can find the latest on Marble at <a href="http://edu.kde.org/marble" target="_self">edu.kde.org/marble</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9950f1.large.jpg"><img src="9950f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Marble puts a 3-D virtual globe on your desktop.
</p></div></div><p>
Some people invariably will compare this to Google Earth, but unlike
Google Earth, Marble is extremely lightweight and doesn't require 3-D
acceleration. Consequently, it runs beautifully on more modest
hardware. When you start Marble the first time, it creates the
map and prepares the data. While this process takes place, a progress
bar appears on the screen (Figure
2). This only happens once.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9950f2.large.jpg"><img src="9950f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Marble
starts up very quickly, except the first time when it builds its map.
</p></div></div><p>
Marble's interface is easy to use. On the right, in the
main part of the program window, your globe beckons you. In the left-hand
sidebar, the main tab (one of three) is labeled Navigation with a list
of cities right below the search field. Marble will take you to a city in
a flash (Figure 3). You can scroll around the globe simply by
clicking and dragging from any point on the surface, or you can
type the name of a city in the search field. If you have a scroll wheel,
you can zoom in on the surface view by rolling your scroll wheel
up and zoom out by scrolling down. Alternatively, you also can click the
arrow keys in the navigation pane and use the zoom controls there.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9950f3.large.jpg"><img src="9950f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Navigating
to a faraway place is as easy as typing its name in the search field.
</p></div></div><p>
There are, as I mentioned, three tabs. Below the Navigation tab is
another labeled Legend and one more labeled Map View. The symbols used
to identify various features on the map are all listed under the Legend
tab. The Map View tab gives you access to other surface views. The default
is the atlas view you see in the screenshots here, but Marble also can use
a plain map, a realistic satellite image and the famous &ldquo;earth at
night&rdquo; view. Switching from one to the other takes only a second.
</p><p>
Exploring the world with Marble is great fun and educational as
well. To find out more about a city, left-click on that city, then select
its name from the pop-up window. When you click the name, Marble opens
a link to the Wikipedia entry for that city. It's a great way to pay
a virtual visit to some exotic places like Toronto, Canada (Figure
4); London, England; Paris, France; Milan, Italy; or even
Snellville, Georgia.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9950f4.large.jpg"><img src="9950f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Marble
links to Wikipedia to provide details on the city you're exploring.
</p></div></div><p>
Some great additional features also are fun to explore. For
instance, right-click on any point and select Add Measure Point. A
small cross appears. Move to another location on the globe and add
another measuring point. Doing this, I discovered that it's 6,024.89
kilometers from Madrid to Toronto (as the proverbial crow flies). I was
also happy to know that it's roughly 760 kilometers from the North Pole
to the North Magnetic Pole.
</p><p>
You also can define a home location by right-clicking on a city and
selecting Set Home Location. Marble remembers the view, including
the scale you were using when you set the home point.
</p><p>
Closing time approaches,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and although it saddens me that time passes
so quickly,
this gives me an opportunity to introduce one final virtual view
of the world&mdash;one that specifically deals with time&mdash;Matthias
Hoelzer-Kluepfel's
KWorldClock. Essentially, KWorldClock is a graphical application
that shows what parts of the world are in sunlight and what parts are
in darkness, in real time. It's also a clock that shows the time
in a number of locations around the world (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9950f5.large.jpg"><img src="9950f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. KWorldClock
shows the passing of time in a satellite's view.
</p></div></div><p>
The default map has several points visible across the surface of the
planet. The terminator moves across the planet as the minutes tick by,
so you can see who not to call long distance in the evening. As you move
across the map, you'll see pop-ups showing the date and time for
that location. Right-click on a location, select Clocks, then Add,
and a clock for that location appears at the bottom of the display
window. In this way, you can keep track of the date and time from many
different world locations. You also can flag locations of interest
(so you can find them again) by right-clicking on a location and selecting
Flags from the menu (Figure 6). This pins a colored flag
wherever you choose.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9950f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Add markers, flags, city clocks or change the look of the map.
</p></div></div><p>
Notice as well the Map Theme option on that pop-up menu. By default,
KWorldClock comes with two maps: a flat atlas-style map and a colored
map simulating elevation. Other map styles are available from the
kdeartwork-misc package. These include a rainfall map, a relative
altitude map and more. To see available themes,
run <tt  >kworldclock --themes</tt> from the command line.
Passing the
<tt  >--help</tt> option shows other parameters available
to
the program.
</p><p>
Here's a cool trick. KDE desktop users can use a full-screen version
of KWorldClock as their desktop wallpaper. Right-click on your desktop
and select Configure Desktop. When the configuration window opens,
click on Background in the left-hand sidebar. Click the No picture
radio button for your background image, then click the Advanced Options
button. Next, click the Use the following program for drawing the
background
box, select kdeworld from the list, and click the Modify button
(Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9950f7.large.jpg"><img src="9950f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The KWorldClock program makes for a great, dynamic wallpaper.
</p></div></div><p>
This also is a good time to change various settings, such as the display
theme (for example, <tt  >--theme rainfall</tt>). The default
refresh time is every
ten minutes, which probably is a sane setting, but you certainly
can change it if you like. When you are happy with your settings, click OK to close the
various
dialogs, and you'll have a nice, dynamic background.
</p><p>
As the great shadow of night moves across the planet, we are
reminded that it is indeed closing time here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>. Before
we all head home, I'm sure we can convince Fran&ccedil;ois
to refill everyone's glass one more time. And, perhaps, someday, if he
manages to digitize himself, an electronic Fran&ccedil;ois will do the job
for us. Personally, despite his many quirks, I prefer the
real Fran&ccedil;ois, as I'm sure you all do.
Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to
one
another's health.
