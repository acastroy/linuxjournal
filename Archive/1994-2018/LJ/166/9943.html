<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #166, February 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Keiichi Kii</b></span> translated the <span   class="bold"><b>SubmittingPatches</b></span> file into Japanese, and
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> passed it along for inclusion in the kernel tree.
Greg initially had suggested the translation of this and other kernel
docs himself, pointing out that the originals rarely changed, so it should be
fairly easy for translators to keep up with them.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Vince Kim</b></span> submitted a patch to add support
for <span   class="bold"><b>LZO compression to
CramFS</b></span>, using <span   class="bold"><b>Richard Purdie's</b></span>
<span   class="bold"><b>LZO kernel library</b></span>. The result was a
performance gain, at a cost of a 10% larger driver binary.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Zhang Wei</b></span> posted a driver for the
<span   class="bold"><b>Freescale MPC8540 DMA controller</b></span>,
commonly used in routers, switches, printers and similar devices. He
also added a corresponding &ldquo;Freescale DMA Driver&rdquo; entry to the
MAINTAINERS file, listing himself as the official maintainer.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephen Hemminger</b></span> posted a driver, called
<span   class="bold"><b>apanel</b></span>, to control the panel
lights on some <span   class="bold"><b>Fujitsu LifeBook laptops</b></span>. He based his work on an
earlier effort by <span   class="bold"><b>Jochen Eisenger</b></span>, but Stephen's work uses no ioctls
or user-space d&aelig;mons as Jochen's did. <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> replied with some
minor criticism and praised Stephen's mastery of operator precedence
in C. It looks like this driver will be accepted fairly quickly.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Samuel Ortiz</b></span> posted a driver for the
<span   class="bold"><b>Compaq ASIC3 multifunction chip</b></span>
found in many handheld devices. Andrew Morton ran the checkpatch
script on Samuel's patch and found many stylistic problems, which he
asked Samuel to take care of and resubmit. Andrew also had technical
issues and questions, and Samuel posted a new patch in response.
</p><p>
As he has done many times before, <span   class="bold"><b>Adrian
Bunk</b></span> made another abortive
effort to remove the <span   class="bold"><b>eepro100 driver</b></span> that
the <span   class="bold"><b>e100 driver</b></span> is supposed
to replace. He submitted his patch, and <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff
Garzik</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Auke Kok</b></span>
pointed out that there were still known problems with e100 that made
it not yet a suitable replacement. <span   class="bold"><b>David
Acker</b></span>, who's been working on
these issues, said he would step up his efforts, but he also said that the
difficulty of testing specific bugs had generally made the project a
lower priority for him at the moment.
</p><p>
Adrian also posted a patch removing three <span   class="bold"><b>I2C
drivers</b></span>: i2c-ixp2000.c,
i2c-ixp4xx.c and scx200_i2c.c; there was no dissent on the list, so
this probably is the end of those drivers in Linux.
</p><p>
Adrian also posted a patch to remove <span   class="bold"><b>legacy I2C RTC
drivers</b></span> that
already have replacement drivers in the kernel. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Jean Delvare</b></span> said
that some platforms still relied on the legacy drivers, and that they should be
updated to use the replacements before the old drivers were removed.
He alerted the <span   class="bold"><b>rtc-linux mailing list</b></span> that
the <span   class="bold"><b>PowerPC platform
code</b></span> should be updated as soon as possible.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Robert P. J. Day</b></span> posted a patch removing
the remaining bits of <span   class="bold"><b>APUS
support</b></span> from the PowerPC architecture. Some APUS code already
had been
removed in 2.6.23, and the rest had been listed as broken for more than two
years, so it was time to go. No one voiced any opposition to this
patch, but Adrian said he also had a similar patch he'd been
planning to release soon. It turns out Robert has written a script to
find dead code in the kernel, which he runs every once in a while to
locate things that can be removed safely.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Gabriel Craciunescu</b></span> discovered that the
<span   class="bold"><b>TLAN network driver mailing
list</b></span> would accept posts only from subscribers, so he posted a patch to
note that in the MAINTAINERS file.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sam Ravnborg</b></span> announced the creation of a
new <span   class="bold"><b>linux-kbuild mailing list</b></span>
on the <span   class="bold"><b>vger servers</b></span> to replace the old kbuild-devel list on
<span   class="bold"><b>SourceForge</b></span> and posted a patch updating the MAINTAINERS file to show
the new list. The old list could be posted to only by subscribers, and
it also was moderated. Sam decided to make the new list after he'd
seen too many e-mail messages dropped from the old one. There was not much
discussion on linux-kernel about this, but it's doubtful any serious
objections will be made. The old list was subscriber-only primarily
because of a spam problem that had started when the list first came to
SourceForge. Presumably, with the relatively new antispam measures
that have been adopted on vger, that problem should be a lot more
tolerable.
</p><p>
Having obtained the relevant hardware, <span   class="bold"><b>Maciej W.
Rozycki</b></span> posted a
patch to the MAINTAINERS file, listing the <span   class="bold"><b>DZ DECStation DZ11 serial
driver</b></span> and listing himself as the official maintainer.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Larry Finger</b></span> has stepped down from
maintaining the <span   class="bold"><b>b43legacy code</b></span> and
is seeking a new maintainer. He's also offered to give a <span   class="bold"><b>Linksys
WPC54G networking card</b></span> that has the relevant BCM4306/2 chip to anyone
who'll take over the code. Apparently, most of the maintenance
requirements involve porting <span   class="bold"><b>Michael Beusch's b43
patches</b></span> into
b43legacy. Michael also is stepping down from maintaining the bcm43xx
code, but a replacement will not be needed, as that code is no
longer needed and will be coming out of the kernel at some point.

<h2 class="title">The gPhone That Isn't: Google Keeps the Linux-Based Handset Market Open</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #166, February 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
What stood out most in Google's announcement of Android in November 2007 was
not that it was a Linux-based open phone platform (there are several of
those already), but that it looked, quite literally, like something more
than the &ldquo;iPhone killer&rdquo; many expected. It was, instead, a
closed-phone killer.

</p><p>
Well, not really. The iPhone isn't going to die. Rather, it looked like an
open alternative to the iPhone that might be exactly what the phone-makers
need to get out of their death dance with carriers and start making
cellular telephony (and mobile everything) Net-native.
</p><p>
Apple, for all its inventiveness (which is enormous&mdash;credit where due),
did a deal with the devil when it launched the iPhone in partnership with
AT&amp;T.
In so doing, Apple became a captive manufacturer for one carrier and
crippled the iPhone's Net nativity. Google, on the other hand, put its
enormous market heft behind all phone-makers with the guts to risk breaking
ranks with its carrier partners and to start making truly open mobile
handsets (a carefully chosen word that means &ldquo;more than phones&rdquo;).
</p><p>
The platform is called Android, and the SDK invites development of all
kinds of devices, with phones playing the center circle of the market's
bull's-eye.
</p><p>
But, the target is much bigger. To explore those dimensions, Google is
offering $10 million in awards for developers building mobile apps for the
platform.
</p><p>
Challenge I runs from January 2, 2008 through March 3, 2008 (right now, if
you're reading this fresh off the newsstand or out of the mailbox). Fifty
winners will receive $25,000 toward additional development and will be
eligible for ten awards of $275,000 each, plus ten others at $100,000 each.
Those are due May 1, 2008, and will be announced at the end of that month. The $5
million Challenge II will reward development on Android-based handsets that
will start shipping later in the year. Details for that have not yet
been revealed at the time of this writing.
</p><p>
Winners will &ldquo;leverage all that the Android platform has to offer in order
to provide consumers with their most compelling experiences&rdquo;. If you win
(or even if you don't), the intellectual property you create (even if you
don't wish to call it that) will be yours to keep.
</p><p>
What's especially cool about the &ldquo;gPhone&rdquo; is that it isn't for, or by,
Google. That was the defaulted expectation of many, based on expectations
set by Apple with the iPhone. Instead, the field remains, as it already was,
wide open.

<h2 class="title">Third-Generation Nokia Tablet Gains a Keyboard and GPS</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #166, February 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We can't wait to get our hands on the new Nokia N810, announced last October
and released in November 2007 (when we're writing this). Unlike its
predecessors, the N770 and the N800, the N810 has one big stand-out
(actually, slide-out) difference: a qwerty keyboard. That alone makes it
far more desirable, and far more like the departed Sharp Zaurus&mdash;a unit
some of us still miss.
</p><p>
The other big difference is built-in GPS. The N800, which currently holds
the title of Ultimate Linux Handheld (September 2007), required an external
GPS receiver connected to the unit by Bluetooth.
</p><p>
On the downside (at least for this writer) is that Nokia has dropped the
built-in FM radio featured in the N800. We liked that feature and were
looking forward to improvements in it, such as RDS support. Perhaps, if
enough of us care, a worthy FM radio will return in a future version.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, we look forward to reviewing the N810 in depth for an upcoming
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.

<h2 class="title">Searching for Consistencies</h2>

We ran across a list of Google search results from June 29, 2004, and
thought it might be interesting to compare them with searches on two days
in November 2007.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1f4c580.0x2044250"></a><p class="title"><b>Google Search Comparison</b></p><table     summary="Google Search Comparison9943searcht1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>June 29, 2004</th><th>November 8, 2007</th><th>November 13, 2007</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>

Worth noting here is that the November 8, 2007, searches were done in London, but
at google.us, to avoid the google.uk site (though tested results were
essentially the same when I tried both). The November 13, 2007, searches were done
in the US&mdash;Boston, to be exact.
</p><p>
Still, the widely varying results make one wonder why the largest deployer
of Linux in the world (as well as the world's leading search engine) can't
yield more consistent, if not useful, numbers.

<h2 class="title">Mobile Linux Groundswell</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #166, February 2008</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The rumble you hear in the ground is embedded Linux moving into the vast
mobile space&mdash;filling it not just with more closed devices built on open
platforms, but with truly open devices that can connect anybody with
anybody or anything, any way they like&mdash;and to write and use whatever
programs they like, without having to limit usage to the insides of
carriers' and equipment-makers' walled gardens.
</p><p>
That's where several harbingers are pointed.
</p><p>
First, there's Nokia's Linux-based N series tablets, now in their third
generation with the N810. What matters isn't just that the N line keeps
improving (and the Maemo development community right along with it), but
that Nokia will sell its billionth phone sometime soon&mdash;yet it still needs
to cripple most of those devices to fit the customer-containing purposes of
its carrier partners' walled gardens. The goal here is to make the Net
mobile, and it won't happen until Linux-modeled development methods and
values prevail.
</p><p>
Next, there's Linux mobile phone work. In November 2007, Google announced both the
Linux-based Android mobile phone platform and the Open Handset Alliance;
both add momentum to established open Linux handset development efforts by
MontaVista, OpenMoko, Trolltech and others. (Of course, there also
are plenty of closed handsets with Linux inside, but those play a lesser role
in this movement.)
</p><p>
Next, there's the XO Linux laptop from One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), which
finally has begun shipping. The inventive little device is coming in at
higher than the originally projected $100 price, but it still has plenty of
promise and breaks new technical and cultural ground.
</p><p>
Then, there are efforts, such as the Xandros-based ASUS Eee PC (3EPC) 701
&ldquo;ultra-mobile&rdquo; laptop and development platforms from Intel and Via for
Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs) and Ultra-Mobile Devices (UMDs),
respectively, all of which pave the path toward wanton mobile Linux device
development.
</p><p>
Together these suggest that Linux will win in the palm and the ear before
it wins in the lap. But, those wins will be bigger anyway, as handheld
mobile devices outnumber desktops and laptops by a wide margin. (See
this month's <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
Index for some of the latest numbers.)
