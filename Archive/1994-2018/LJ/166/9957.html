Have a Beer, for Free</h4><p>
In Shawn Powers' December 2007 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> article
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, Meet
GPL; GPL, Meet <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>&rdquo;, he states,
&ldquo;As Linux users, we're familiar with terms like, 'Free as in speech and
free as in beer'. For the record, I have never understood the latter
part of that motto. Beer is rarely free.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The reason he does not understand the second part is because he is
misquoting. The true quote is:
&ldquo;Free as in free speech, not as in free beer.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I am sadly surprised that the editors of a magazine dedicated to the
Linux community did not catch this.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Eric   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake
3</em></span>
article, I wrote that I didn't fully understand the notion of &ldquo;Free as in
beer.&rdquo; In
the next paragraph, I go on to explain what it means, and left the &ldquo;I
don't
get it&rdquo; part as a silly view of the free beer concept. For the record, I
get it. The responses I received via e-mail, however, make me wonder if we,
as a community, really do &ldquo;get it&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The most common response I got was that I misquoted the free software
definition, and that it's supposed to be, &ldquo;Free as in speech, not as
in beer.&rdquo;
The problem is that I wasn't trying to quote the definition of &ldquo;free
software&rdquo; but rather talk about what is meant by free beer. Trust me, I
didn't wrongly coin the idea of software being free as in beer. Just ask
Google.
</p><p>
Although I won't ramble on regarding the definitions and social implications
of wordsmithing semantics, I will point out something that pains me as a
Linux user. If we become an exclusive community that listens only to those
versed in the doctrine of the FSF, and we don't remember our grass roots, we're doomed to be an elitist group of snobs.
</p><p>
So, although I understand (mostly) the ideas of free software, and I understand
that free beer is referring to getting something for no money, I still
say it's hard to find beer for free. So come on in, sit down, and I'll buy
you a beer. We can talk about how to get one for free together&mdash;and maybe
frag each other in <span   class="emphasis"><em>OpenArena</em></span>, because
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> I know where to get without
paying a dime.

Regarding James Gray's &ldquo;The State of the Market: a Linux Laptop
Buying Guide&rdquo; in the December 2007 
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>: if the Linux desktop is so great, why would a
Linux laptop vendor not offering dual boot with
Windows be considered a negative? Why would Linux
desktop users <span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> their Linux laptop to be dual-booted
with Windows?
</p><p>
The same could be said of the &ldquo;My Triple Boot Laptop&rdquo;
article in the same issue. Why is multiple booting
with Windows such an important thing?
</p><p>
The real question is, why is the Linux desktop not
usable enough to throw Windows away? And, what can we
do about it?
</p><p>
Don't get me wrong, I'm a Linux guy and love your
magazine!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mike   <br><br>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>James Gray replies:</b></span>
Thanks for your message. I get your point and the underlying frustration
that comes with it. Although I cannot speak for every Linux user, our
community has feistily developed a culture of choice, openness and
heterogeneous environments. In other words, we choose the right tool for
the job, and make sure every part of the system can interact.
</p><p>
In my case, I am a devoted Linux user 99% of the time, where nearly all of
my needs are met. However, for instance, my wife signed us up for the
Yahoo! Music service, which I've come to enjoy a great deal.
Unfortunately, Yahoo! Music doesn't give a rip (yet) about Linux, and
CrossOver Linux won't run the Yahoo! Music Engine (yet). 
</p><p>
Actions from companies like Dell, which is now expanding its Linux
offerings, prove that the sluggish, mainstream computing world is finally
learning what we've known for years&mdash;that Linux is here to stay. I and
many of our fellow Linuxers keep Windows around as an interim solution
until the day of its forthcoming irrelevance.

mkdir Errors Even More Trivial</h4><p>
Upon reading Steeve's letter to the editor in the
November 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I was glad to see advocacy
of error handling in bash scripts, but I think the &ldquo;trivial&rdquo;
example provided is elaborate compared to a simple trick
that has been available since the days of the original Bourne
shell.
</p><p>
The -e flag tells bash to stop executing the script
upon encountering any error outside of a conditional
expression. Error checking is often omitted simply
because it is cumbersome to write. Not only is the -e
flag more succinct, but using it makes error checking
effortless.
</p><p>
Comparing the two methods is impressive. The
longer version produces two error messages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecashin@cat ecashin$ cat err-baroque.sh
mkdir -p /foo
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Error: could not create\
       directory /foo"
       exit 1
fi
echo /foo
ecashin@cat ecashin$ sh err-baroque.sh
mkdir: cannot create directory `/foo': Permission denied
Error: could not create directory /foo
ecashin@cat ecashin$
</pre>
</p><p>
The shorter version leverages the fact that the
Bourne shell design has always made error handling
trivial:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecashin@cat ecashin$ cat err-e.sh
set -e
mkdir /foo
echo /foo
ecashin@cat ecashin$ sh err-e.sh
mkdir: cannot create directory `/foo': Permission denied
ecashin@cat ecashin$
</pre>
</p><p>
Error handling is a balance between doing too much
and doing too little. The -e flag allows us to get the
job done without cluttering code or tempting us not to
bother.

Floating-Point Simplicity</h4><p>
I've read Dave Taylor's columns since the first one, and it's nice to see someone writing
about shell programming and command lines.
In the December 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, Dave spoke about the need
for doing floating-point
operations at the command-line level.
You can perform those actions by using a single command line involving bc,
as you can see in the following sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'scale=4^J11/7' | bc
1.5714
</pre>
</p><p>
The ^J is obtained by issuing Crtl-V+Ctrl-J.

We Have Not Won the Battle</h4><p>
I picked up the June 2007 copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> today, looking for one of Dave
Taylor's articles on bash programming (I'll have to go further back
than that issue to find an answer to my query) and opened it at Doc
Searls' article &ldquo;Picking New Fights&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I'm not too sure that the battle is won, Doc, and here are a couple of
cases in point&mdash;admittedly both are Aussie experiences; maybe things are
better in the good-old US of A?
</p><p>
We had a segment on prime-time TV a couple of days ago on Negroponte's
$100 laptop, which was very interesting, with an in-depth discussion of the thought
that has been put into the project to enable its use in areas without
electricity and to provide a unit rugged enough to withstand its likely
treatment&mdash;all in an endeavor to bring the world and its consequent
education to those of us who are much less fortunate. A full half-hour
presentation of a great community service, and there was not one word about Linux.
NOT ONE WORD on such an important factor in keeping the price as low
as possible, apart from its obvious absolute superiority in a case like
this, where I reckon those young minds will revel in the variety and
flexibility that Linux can offer.
</p><p>
Here's another example.
When an ad from Mindscape Asia Pacific Pty Ltd for &ldquo;Family Tree Maker
Platinum 2008&rdquo; appeared in my inbox, I e-mailed them, asking what
OSes
were supported. There was no information in the ad about operating
systems&mdash;just the software.
</p><p>
This was their reply:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Hi David,
the operating systems supported for the new FTM 17 are Windows XP and
Vista.
</p><p>
Kind Regards,
</p><p>
Ann, Mindscape
</p></blockquote></div><p>
To which I e-mailed:
&ldquo;No Linux support, eh?&rdquo;
</p><p>
That message triggered the following:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Hi David,
no, I'm afraid no Linux support.
That would be something you will need to take up with Family Tree Maker
in the US who develops the program. In fact, currently all our programs
are Windows- or MAC-based with single-user licenses in most cases.
</p><p>
Kind Regards,
</p><p>
Ann
</p></blockquote></div><p>
My response, to which I have had no reply, was perhaps a bit terse:
&ldquo;That's interesting, Ann. One wonders if it wouldn't be in Mindscape's
own interests to take this matter up with FTM directly rather ask than a
disgruntled prospective client of yours.&rdquo;

</p><a name="N0x1cb8580.0x21aa6f0"></a><h4 class="title"><a name="N0x1cb8580.0x21aa6f0"></a>And, the Winner Is...</h4><p>
In the December 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, Dave Taylor writes
&ldquo;The challenge
with bc is to revamp how you interact with it...to write a shell
script wrapper that allows us not only to do simple calculations
from the command line, but also have them solved as floating-point calculations.&rdquo;
</p><p>
This isn't really much of a challenge, and it doesn't require a wrapper:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; echo "11/7" | bc -l
1.57142857142857142857
</pre>
</p><p>
What do I win?

LinuxCertified Rocks</h4><p>
I bought my Linux laptop before reading James Gray's &ldquo;The State of
the Market: a Linux Laptop
Buying Guide&rdquo; article in the December 2007 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
In view of the cons in that article about LinuxCertified laptops, I would like to report that I bought an LC2100DC
laptop from LinuxCertified last August (not reviewed in your article), and that all
of the features I use worked flawlessly out of the box. During the
build of my machine, I had a phone call or two from LinuxCertified suggesting
sensible changes to my original configuration, which I accepted. My
laptop came with a CD containing various utilities and drivers, and a
complete manual for the laptop. I also received a Feisty Fawn install
disk, a Feisty Fawn restore disk (containing additional LC drivers), an
XP install disk (not a restore disk), and other disks for the CD/DVD
burner software and so on. I was, thus, rather surprised to see
LinuxCertified put down
for inadequate documentation. I have had quick responses to one or two
support issues via e-mail. In short, my experience with LinuxCertified has been
completely satisfactory.

Additions to the December 2007 &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
Index&rdquo;</h4><p>
I thought I'd add a couple more entries to December's
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Index&rdquo; that, although
they don't pertain to the US Constitution, pertain to the founding of
our country nonetheless and should be noted so as to not sound biased. (A
media, and especially a technology-related, entity would never sound
biased against religion though, would they?)
</p><p>
Number of times the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; appears in the Declaration of Independence:
1
</p><p>
Number of times the word &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; appears in the Declaration of
Independence: 1
</p><p>
Number of times the word &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; appears in the Declaration of
Independence: 1
</p><p>
Number of times the word &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; appears in the Declaration of
Independence: 0
</p><p>
In addition to these, I believe a useful poll question that should be
asked is, how many people believe the US was founded as a religious
nation (not necessarily Christian)? I'm sure many more people (more than
the 55% who believe the Constitution founded a Christian nation) would
agree that this country was founded as a religious country as opposed to
a secular one. Neither term is mentioned in the Constitution; however, the
Declaration
of Independence unquestionably leans toward the religious.

Get Out of Town!</h4><p>
I had to smile at the name of the CTO of RapidMind! [See &ldquo;Picking
the RapidMind&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, November 2007.] If he
were living in Ireland, everyone would call him &ldquo;Mick&rdquo;,
which would be unfortunate for Michael, but a constant source of amusement
down in the local pub!
</p><p>
PS. Of course, is that the McCool's from Cork or the McCool's from Derry?
