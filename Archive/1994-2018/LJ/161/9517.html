Check out Fedora Directory Server to authenticate your clients without
licensing fees.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a70580.0x1b68298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In most enterprise networks today, centralized authentication is a basic
security paradigm. In the Linux realm, OpenLDAP has been king of the
hill for many years, but for those unfamiliar with the LDAP command-line
interface (CLI), it can be a painstaking process to deploy. Enter the
Fedora Directory Server (FDS). Released under the GPL in June 2005 as
Fedora Directory Server 7.1 (changed to version 1.0 in December of the
same year), FDS has roots in both the Netscape Directory Server Project
and its sister product, the Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS). Some of FDS's
notable features are its easy-to-use Java-based Administration Console,
support for LDAP3 and Active Directory integration. By far, the most
attractive feature of FDS is Multi-Master Replication (MMR). MMR allows
for multiple servers to maintain the same directory information, so that
the loss of one server does not bring the directory down as it would in
a master-slave environment.
</p><p>
Getting an FDS server up and running has its ups and downs. Once the
server is operational, however, Red Hat makes it easy to administer your
directory and connect native Fedora clients. In addition to providing
network authentication, you easily can extend FDS functionality across
other applications, such as NFS, Samba, Sendmail, Postfix and
others. In
this article, we focus solely on using FDS for network authentication
and implementing MMR.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a70580.0x1b68500"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
To begin, download a Fedora 6 ISO readily available from one of the
many Fedora mirrors. FDS has low hardware requirements&mdash;500MHz with
256MB RAM and 3GB or more space. I recommend at least a 1GHz processor
or above with 512MB or more memory and 20GB or more of disk space. This
configuration should perform well enough to support small businesses up
to enterprises with thousands users. As for supported operating systems,
not surprisingly, Red Hat lists Fedora and Red Hat flavors of Linux. HP-UX
and Solaris also are supported. With your bootable ISO CD, start the Fedora
6 installation process, and select your desired system preferences and
packages. Make sure to select Apache during installation. Set your host
and DNS information during the install, using a fully qualified domain
name (FQDN). You also can set this information post-install, but it is
critical that your host information is configured properly. If you plan to use
a firewall, you need to enter two ports to allow LDAP (389 default)
and the Admin Console (default is random port). For the servers used here,
I chose ports 3891 and 3892 because of an existing LDAP installation in
my environment. Fedora also natively supports Security-Enhanced Linux
(SELinux), a policy-based lock-down tool, if you choose to use it. If you
want to use SELinux, you must choose the Permissive Policy.
</p><p>
Once your Fedora 6 server is up, download and install the latest RPM of
Fedora Directory Server from the FDS site (it is not included in the
Fedora 6 distribution). Running the RPM unpacks the program files
to /opt/fedora-ds. At this point, download and install the current Java
Runtime Environment (JRE) .bin file from Sun before running the local
setup of FDS. To keep files in the same place, I created an /opt/java
directory and downloaded and ran the .bin file from there. After Java is
installed, replace the existing soft link to Java in /etc/alternatives
with a link to your new Java installation. The following syntax does
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /etc/alternatives
rm ./java
ln -sf /opt/java/jre1.5.0_09/bin/java java  
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, configure Apache to start on boot with the chkconfig command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chkconfig -level 345 httpd on
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, start the service by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service httpd start
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, with the useradd command, create an account named fedorauser
under which FDS will run. After creating the account, run
<tt  >/opt/fedora-ds/setup/setup</tt> to launch the FDS installation script. Before
continuing, you may be presented with several error messages about
non-optimal configuration issues, but in most cases, you can answer
yes to get past them and start the setup process. Once started,
select the default Install Mode 2 - Typical. Accept all defaults during
installation except for the Server and Group IDs, for which we are using
the fedorauser account (Figure 1), and if you want to customize the
ports as we have here, set those to the correct numbers (3891/3892). You
also may want to use the same passwords for both the configuration Admin
and Directory Manager accounts created during setup.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9517f1.large.jpg"><img src="9517f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Install Options
</p></div></div><p>
When setup is complete, use the syntax returned from the
script to access the admin console (<tt  >./startconsole -u admin
http://fullyqualifieddomainname:port</tt>) using the Administrator account
(default name is Admin) you specified during the FDS setup. You always can
call the Admin console using this same syntax from /opt/fedora-ds.
</p><p>
At this point, you have a functioning directory server. The final step
is to create a startup script or directly edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local to
start the slapd process and the admin server when the machine starts.
Here is an example of a script that does this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

/opt/fedora-ds/slapd-yourservername/start-slapd
/opt/fedora-ds/start-admin &amp;

</pre>

Directory Structure and Management</h2></div></div><p>
Looking at the Administration console, you will see server information on the
Default tab (Figure 2) and a search utility on the second tab. On the
Servers and Applications tab, expand your server name to display the two
server consoles that are accessible: the Administration Server and the
Directory Server. Double-click the Directory Server icon, and you are taken
to the Tasks tab of the Directory Server (Figure 3). From here, you can
start and stop directory services, manage certificates, import/export
directory databases and back up your server. The backup feature is one
of the highlights of the FDS console. It lets you back up any directory
database on your server without any knowledge of the CLI. The only caveat
is that you still need to use the CLI to schedule backups.

Figure 3. Tasks Tab
</p></div></div><p>
On the Status tab, you can view the appropriate logs to monitor activity or
diagnose problems with FDS (Figure 4). Simply expand one of the logs in
the left pane to display its output in the right pane. Use the Continuous
Refresh option to view logs in real time.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9517f4.large.jpg"><img src="9517f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Main Logs
</p></div></div><p>
From the Configuration tab, you can define replicas (copies of the directory)
and synchronization options with other servers, edit schema, initialize
databases and define options for logs and plugins. The Directory
tab is laid out by the domains for which the server hosts information. The
Netscape folder is created automatically by the installation and stores
information about your directory. The config folder is used by FDS to
store information about the server's operation. In most cases, it should
be left alone, but we will use it when we set up replication.
</p><p>
Before creating your directory structure, you should carefully consider
how you want to organize your users in the directory. There
is not enough space here for a decent primer on directory planning, but
I typically use Organizational Units (OUs) to segment people grouped
together by common security needs, such as by department (for example,
Accounting). Then, within an OU, I create users and groups for simplifying permissions or
creating e-mail address lists (for example, Account Managers). FDS also supports
roles, which essentially are templates for new users. This strategy
is not hard and fast, and you certainly can use the default domain
directory structure created during installation for most of your needs
(Figure 5). Whatever strategy you choose, you should consult the Red Hat
documentation prior to deployment.
</p><p>
To create a new user, right-click an OU under your domain and click
on New&rarr;User to bring up the New User screen (Figure 5). Fill in the
appropriate entries. At minimum, you need a First Name, Last Name and
Common Name (cn), which is created from your first and last name. Your
login ID is created automatically from your first initial and your
last name. You also can enter an e-mail address and a password. From
the options in the left pane of the User window, you can add NT User
information, Posix Account information and activate/de-activate the
account. You can implement a Password Policy from the Directory tab
by right-clicking a domain or OU and selecting Manage Password
Policy. However, I could not get this feature to work properly.

Replication</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up replication in FDS is a relatively
painless process. In our
scenario, we configure two-way multi-master replication, but Red Hat
supports up to four-way. Because we already have one server (server one)
in operation, we need another system (server two) configured the same way
(Fedora, FDS) with which to replicate. Use the same settings used on server one
(other than hostname) to install and configure Fedora 6/FDS. With both
servers up, verify time synchronization and name resolution between
them. The servers must have synced time or be relatively close in
their offset, and they must be able to resolve the other's hostname for
replication to work. You can use IP addresses, configure /etc/hosts or use
DNS. I recommend having DNS and NTP in place already to make life easier.
</p><p>
The next step is creating a Replication Manager account to bind one
server's directory to the other and vice versa. On the Directory
tab of the Directory Server console, create a user account under
the config folder (off the main root, not your domain), and give
it the name Replication Manager, which should create a login ID
(uid) of RManager. Use the same password for the RManager on both
servers/directories. On server one, click the Configuration tab
and then the Replication folder. In the right pane, click Enable
Changelog. Click the Use Default button to fill in the default path
under your slapd-servername directory. Click Save. Next, expand
the Replication folder and click on the userroot database. In the right
pane, click on enable replica, and select Multiple Master under the Replica
Role section (Figure 6). Enter a unique Replica ID. This number must
be different on each server involved in replication. Scroll down to
the update section below, and in the Enter a new supplier DN:
textbox, enter the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uid=RManager,cn=config
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9517f6.large.jpg"><img src="9517f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Setting Up Replica
</p></div></div><p>
Click Add, and then the Save button at the bottom. On server two, perform the
same steps as just completed for creating the RManager account in the
config folder, enabling changelogs and creating a Multiple Master Replica
(with a different Replica ID).
</p><p>
Now, you need to set up a replication agreement back on server one. From the
Configuration tab of the Directory Server, right-click the userroot
database, and select New Replication Agreement. A wizard then guides
you through the process. Enter a name and description for the agreement
(Figure 7). On the Source and Destination screen under Consumer, click 
the Other button to add server two as a consumer. You must use the FQDN
and the correct port (3891 in our case). Use Simple Authentication in the
Connection box, and enter the full context (uid=Rmanager,cn=config) of the
RManager account and the password for the account (Figure 8). On the
next screen, check off the box to enable Fractional Replication to 
send only deltas rather than the entire directory database when changes occur,
which is very useful over WAN connections. On the Schedule screen, select
Always keep directories in sync to keep. You also could choose to schedule
your updates. On the Initialize Consumer screen, use the Initialize Now
option. If you experience any difficulty in initializing a consumer
(server two), you can use the Create consumer initialization file option
and copy the resulting ldif folder to server two and import and initialize
it from the Directory Server Tasks pane. When you click next, you will
see the replication taking place. A summary appears at the end of
the process. To verify replication took place, check the Replication and
Error logs on the first server for success messages. To complete MMR, set
up a replication agreement on the server, listing server one as the consumer,
but do not initialize at the end of the wizard. Doing so would overwrite
the directory on server one with the directory on server two. With our
setup complete, we now have a redundant authentication infrastructure in
place, and if we choose, we can add another two Read-Write replicas/Masters.

Authenticating Desktop Clients</h2></div></div><p>
With our infrastructure in place, we can connect our desktop clients. For
our configuration, we use native Fedora 6 clients and Windows
XP clients to simulate a mixed environment. Other Linux flavors
can connect to FDS, but for space constraints, we won't delve into
connecting them. It should be noted that most distributions like Fedora
use PAM, the /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/ldap.conf files to set up LDAP
authentication. Regardless of client type, the user account attempting
to log in must contain Posix information in the directory in order
to authenticate to the FDS server. To connect Fedora clients,
use the built-in Authentication utility available in both GNOME and KDE
(Figure 9). The nice thing about the utility is that it does all the work for
you. You do not have to edit any of the other files previously
mentioned manually. Open the utility and enable LDAP on the User Information
tab and the Authentication tabs. Once you click OK to these settings,
Fedora updates your nsswitch.conf and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files
immediately. Upon reboot, your system now uses PAM instead of your
local passwd and shadow files to authenticate users.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9517f9.large.jpg"><img src="9517f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. The Built-in Authentication Utility
</p></div></div><p>
During login, the local system pulls the LDAP account's Posix
information from FDS and sets the system to match the preferences set
on the account regarding home directory and shell options. With a
little manual work, you also can use automount locally to 
authenticate and mount network volumes at login time automatically.
</p><p>
Connecting XP clients is almost as easy. Typically, NT/2000/XP users
are forced to use the built-in MSGINA.dll to authenticate to Microsoft
networks only. In the past, vendors such as Novell have used their own
proprietary clients to work around this, but now the open-source pgina
client has solved this problem. To connect 2000/XP clients, download the
main pgina zipfile from the project page on SourceForge, and extract
the files. For this article, I used version 1.8.4 as I ran into some dll
issues with version 1.8.8. You also need to download and extract
the Plugin bundle. Run the x86 installer from the extracted files,
accepting all default options, but do not start the Configuration Tool
at the end. Next, install the LDAPAuth plugin from the extracted Plugin
bundle. When done installing, open the Configuration Tool under the Pgina
Program Group under the Start menu. On the Plugin tab, browse to your
ldapauth_plus.dll in the directory specified during the install. Check off
the option to Show authentication method selection box. This gives you
the option of logging locally if you run into problems. Without this, the
only way to bypass the pgina client is through Safe Mode. Now, click on
the Configure button, and enter the LDAP server name, port and context you
want pgina to use to search for clients. I suggest using the Search Mode
as your LDAP method as it will search the entire directory if it cannot
find your user ID. Click OK twice to save your settings. Use the Plugin
Tester tool before rebooting to load your client and test connectivity
(Figure 10). On the next login, the user will receive the prompt shown
in Figure 11.

Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
FDS is a powerful platform, and this article has barely scratched the
surface. There simply is not room to squeeze all of FDS's other features,
such as encryption or AD synchronization, into a single article. If you are
interested in these items or want to know how to extend FDS to other applications,
check out the wiki and the how-tos on the project's documentation
page for further information. Judging from our simple configuration
here, FDS seems evolutionary, not revolutionary. It does not change
the way in which LDAP operates at a fundamental level. What it does
do is take the complex task of administering LDAP and makes it easier
while extending normally commercial features, such as MMR, to open source. By
adding pgina into the mix, you can tap further into FDS's flexibility and
cost savings without needing to deploy an array of services to connect
Windows and Linux clients. So, if you are looking for a simple, reliable
and cost-saving alternative to other LDAP products, consider FDS.
