Most people who have written networking software are familiar with the
TCP and UDP protocols. These are used to connect distributed applications
and allow messages to flow between them. These protocols have been used
successfully to build Internet applications as we know them: e-mail,
HTTP, name services and so forth. But, these protocols are more than 20 years old, and
over time, some of their deficiencies have become well known. Although there
have been many attempts to devise new general-purpose transport protocols
above the IP layer, only one so far has received the blessing of the IETF:
SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol). The central motivation behind
SCTP is to provide a more reliable and robust protocol than either TCP
or UDP that can take advantage of features such as multihoming.
</p><p>
SCTP is not a radical departure from TCP or UDP. It borrows from both but
is most similar to TCP. It is a reliable session-oriented protocol, like
TCP. It adds new features and options and allows finer control over the
transport of packets. In all but the &ldquo;edge&rdquo; cases, it can be used as a
drop-in in place of TCP. This means that TCP applications often
can be ported trivially to SCTP. Of course, to benefit properly from the
new features of SCTP, you need to use the additional API calls for SCTP.
</p><p>
The first additional feature in SCTP is better support for multihomed
devices&mdash;that is, computers with more than one network
interface. At
one time this
meant only routers and bridges connecting different parts of the Internet,
but now even computers on the edges of the network can be multihomed.
Most laptops have built-in Ethernet cards and Wi-Fi cards, and many have
Bluetooth cards as well (which have IP support through the Bluetooth PPP
stack). Some laptops now are shipping with WiMAX cards, and it even
is possible to run IP over the infrared port! So, the standard laptop is at
least dual-homed, with possibly up to five distinct IP network interfaces.
</p><p>
TCP and UDP allow use of only one or all of the interfaces.
But, what if you are running your laptop as a peer in, say, a file-sharing service? It probably would be silly to use the Bluetooth
and infrared interfaces. WiMAX can be very expensive to shift large
amounts of data. But, it would make sense to use both the Ethernet and Wi-Fi
interfaces. SCTP can support this selective choosing of interfaces. Some
implementations even can add and drop interfaces dynamically, so as you
unplug your laptop and move out of the house, an application can switch
to the WiMAX interface if you want.
</p><p>
The second main new feature is multistreaming&mdash;that is, one
&ldquo;association&rdquo;
(which is renamed from &ldquo;connection&rdquo; from TCP) can support multiple
data streams. It is no longer necessary to open up multiple sockets;
instead, a single socket can be used for multiple streams to a connected
host. Several TCP applications could benefit from this. For example, FTP
(the major file transfer protocol) uses two streams: one on port 21 for
control messages and another on port 20 for data. This caused problems
with firewalls in place. A client could connect to a server through a
firewall, but the server could not connect to the client for data transfer
because of the firewall. The FTP protocol had to be extended to allow for
&ldquo;passive&rdquo; connections to overcome this. There would be no need for such
an extension under SCTP&mdash;simply send the data on a separate stream in
an association established by a client. 
</p><p>
The X Window System also
uses multiple sockets on multiple ports. Although it is not common,
a computer can have multiple display devices. Typically, the first is
on port 6000, the second on port 6001 and so on. Under SCTP, these could
all be separate streams on a single association. HTML documents often
contain embedded references to image files, and to display a
page properly requires downloading the original page and all of these images (or
embedded frames too). HTTP originally used a separate TCP connection per
downloaded URL, which was expensive and time consuming. HTTP 1.1 brought
in &ldquo;persistent connections&rdquo;, so that a single socket could be reused for
all of these sequential downloads. Under SCTP, the separate images could
be downloaded concurrently in separate streams on a single association.
</p><p>
There are even more subtle uses of SCTP multiple streams. An MPEG movie
consists of different types of frames: I frames, P frames and B
frames. I frames encode complete images, and the other two types
measure differences between frames. Typically, there is an I frame every
ten frames, with the others &ldquo;predicted&rdquo; from these. It is critical that
the I frames be delivered, but less so for the P and B frames. Although
SCTP is not designed as a Quality-of-Service protocol, it does allow
different delivery parameters on different streams within an association,
so that the I frames can be delivered more reliably.
</p><p>
SCTP has many more features, such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
TCP is a byte-oriented protocol, and UDP is message-oriented. The
majority of applications are message-oriented, and applications using TCP
have to jump through hoops, such as sending the message length as a first
parameter. SCTP is message-oriented, so such tricks are not so necessary.
</p></li><li><p>
A single socket can support multiple associations&mdash;that is, a computer
can use a single socket to talk to more than one computer. This is not
multicast, but it could be useful in peer-to-peer situations.
</p></li><li><p>
SCTP has no &ldquo;out of band&rdquo; messages, but a large number of events can
be interleaved onto a single association, so that an application can
monitor the state of the association (for example, when the other end adds
another interface to the association).
</p></li><li><p>
The range of socket options is greater than TCP or UDP. These also
can be used to control individual associations or individual streams within
a single association. For example, messages on one stream can be given
a longer time-to-live than messages on other streams, increasing the
likelihood of their delivery.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249a580.0x2592d40"></a>
Availability of SCTP</h2></div></div><p>
The SCTP Web site (<a href="http://www.sctp.org" target="_self">www.sctp.org</a>) has a list of
implementations of SCTP. There are implementations for BSD and
Windows, and since 2001, there has been a Linux kernel project at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lksctp" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/lksctp</a>. At present, SCTP is not in any
Microsoft release, so applications running on Windows need to install
one of the available stacks.
</p><p>
SCTP is included in the Linux kernel as an experimental network
protocol. SCTP is normally built as a module. It may be necessary to
load the module using <tt  >modprobe sctp</tt>. To build user
applications, you may need to install the SCTP tools&mdash;in Fedora Core
6, these
are in the RPM packages lksctp-tools-1.0.6-1.fc6.i386.rpm and
lksctp-tools-devel-1.0.6-1.fc6.i386.rpm. On Fedora Core 6, I also had
to add a symbolic link from /usr/lib/libsctp.so to /usr/lib/libsctp.so.1.
</p><p>
The lksctp-tools package contains the libraries to run SCTP
applications. It also contains a program called checksctp, which tells you
if your kernel has support for SCTP. When you run this program, it
prints either &ldquo;SCTP supported&rdquo; or an error message.
</p><p>
The devel package contains the sctp.h header file, so you can
compile and build your own applications, and man pages for the
SCTP function calls.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249a580.0x25930b0"></a>
Firewalls</h2></div></div><p>
Most firewalls can be configured to deal with SCTP packets, but the
documentation for each firewall may not mention SCTP explicitly. For
example, the man page for iptables says, &ldquo;The specified protocol [in a
rule] can be one of tcp, udp, icmp, or all...&rdquo;. But, it then goes on to
say, &ldquo;A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed&rdquo;, and in that
file, we find that protocol 132 is sctp. So, rules for SCTP can be added to
iptables in the same way as TCP and UDP rules.
</p><p>
For example, an iptables rule to accept SCTP connections to port 13
would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-A INPUT -p sctp -m sctp -i eth0 --dport 13 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
</p><p>
Webmin is a popular administration tool for managing things like iptables
rules. Unfortunately, as of version 1.340, it could not accept this
rule, because it is hard-wired to accept port numbers only for TCP and
UDP, not realising that SCTP also uses port numbers. Such a rule
would need to be entered by hand into the iptables configuration file
/etc/sysconfig/iptables. This will be fixed in later versions of Webmin
after I logged a bug report, but similar problems may occur in other
tools.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249a580.0x2593370"></a>
One-to-One Socket API</h2></div></div><p>
As with TCP and UDP, SCTP provides a socket API for applications. A
server creates a socket bound to a port and then uses this to accept a
connection from a client. A client also creates a socket and then connects
to a server. Both then use the socket file descriptor to read and write
messages. SCTP is not a superset of TCP. Nevertheless, when restricted to
a similar style of connection as TCP, there are sufficient similarities
that an SCTP socket often can be used as a drop-in replacement for a
TCP socket. When used in this way, SCTP sockets are called one-to-one
sockets, as they simply connect one host to a single other host.
</p><p>
To create a TCP socket, use the system call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP)
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an IPv4 socket. To create an IPv6 socket, replace the first
parameter with AF_INET6. The last parameter often is given as zero,
meaning &ldquo;use the only protocol value in the family&rdquo;. It is better to
use IPPROTO_TCP explicitly, because SCTP introduces another possible value.
</p><p>
To create an SCTP one-to-one socket, simply replace IPPROTO_TCP
with IPPROTO_SCTP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_SCTP)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249a580.0x2593688"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and that (in many cases) is it! The client or server is now talking the
SCTP protocol instead of TCP.
</p><p>
To see this in action, Listings 1 (echo_client.c) and 2
(echo_server.c) give a simple echo-client and server, where the server
returns a string sent to it when a client connects to it. Only the line
above needs to change in both the client and the server (with also an
extra include file, sctp.h).

The usual C compile command can be used to create object modules and
executables. If the program uses SCTP-specific functions (the programs in
Listings 1 and 2 don't), you also need to link in the SCTP library:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cc -o echo_client echo_client.c -lsctp
</pre>
</p><p>
Is it worthwhile to take an application that runs over TCP and move
it to SCTP? The disadvantages are that SCTP is not as well supported
as TCP, the tools are sometimes not aware of SCTP and the API is still
evolving. On the other hand, it benefits from the experience of 20 years
of seeing TCP and UDP applications in practice. For example, SCTP is
secure from SYN attacks by design, and the protocol has no known security
holes. SCTP also will take advantage of multihoming when
needed automatically. If packets are getting lost, due to, say, congestion, SCTP will
use different interfaces to try to avoid the losses, and this could
result in faster throughput.

The withsctp Tool</h2></div></div><p>
In the previous section, I discussed how to alter the source code of a client
or server to use SCTP instead of TCP. The sctp-tools package contains a
program called withsctp, which essentially does the same to binary code. This
program acts as a wrapper around a TCP application to turn it into an
SCTP application. It first saves the address of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; socket()
function call, and then inserts its own version of socket() into the
load library path. This new version of socket() simply gets the parameters
of the function call, changes the third parameter from IPPROTO_TCP to
IPPROTO_SCTP and calls the &ldquo;real&rdquo; socket() function.
</p><p>
For example, the xinetd d&aelig;mon can run a group of TCP and UDP
services. The services are those listed in the directory /etc/xinetd.d,
which have <tt  >enable = yes</tt> or <tt  >disable =
no</tt>. The TCP services all
can be run over SCTP by:

<pre     class="programlisting">
withsctp xinetd
</pre>
</p><p>
One of the simplest services that is run by xinetd is
daytime. The
service accepts a connection and returns an ASCII string for the current
date. A quick Google search turns up source code for many clients, but
the simplest way is to run Telnet:

<pre     class="programlisting">

telnet &lt;host-name&gt; 13

</pre>
</p><p>
If you have daytime running as an SCTP service rather than a TCP service,
use withsctp to connect to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

withsctp telnet &lt;host-name&gt; 13

</pre>
</p><p>
This is a quick way of testing whether a TCP service can be converted
to SCTP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249a580.0x289efa0"></a>
Message Orientation</h2></div></div><p>
TCP is a byte-oriented protocol&mdash;that is, you write bytes and read
bytes. The UNIX system calls read() and write() typically are used for
this. TCP also has send()/recv(), which have an extra flags parameter,
but these do not change the byte-transfer model.
</p><p>
SCTP, on the other hand, is message-oriented, more like UDP. Most Internet
applications have a message structure to their communications rather than
merely a sequence of bytes. For example, a single HTTP request has a header
and body section, and even the header section is composed of an arbitrary
number of lines. The sender has to compose the parts into the single
request, and the receiver of such a message has to parse it back into its
component messages. A few protocols are only byte-oriented
(for example, the file transfer mode of FTP), but these are the minority.
</p><p>
SCTP makes it easy to use a message-based structure&mdash;within limits. A
write() call writes a complete message. The corresponding read() reads
this complete message. So, to send an HTTP header over SCTP, you could do
a write of each line, followed by a write of an empty line. The receiver
would read each line as a separate message, stopping after reading an
empty line. There would be no need to parse the received bytes into a
set of lines before processing each one. Note that if the original TCP
application already used a series of writes followed by a single read,
expecting TCP to concatenate all the messages, the application would
need to be modified to match each write to a corresponding read statement.
</p><p>
The caveats are with big messages. Applications that want to take
advantage of these messaging capabilities must be careful when sending
big messages (say 32KB or more). To send a message, you aren't
merely passing a pointer to data on the stack, you're actually moving that data
across the network. That means putting it into buffers on the sender side,
passing it through buffers in intermediate nodes and, finally, delivering
it to a buffer in the reading application. All of these buffers have
limits that cannot be exceeded.
</p><p>
For example, say a sender uses a buffer with a size set by the socket
option SO_SNDBUF. An attempt to write a message larger than that will
fail and return -1. The size of this is generous, typically about
64KB. It can be changed by using <tt  >setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET,
SO_SNDBUF, &amp;val, &amp;val_len)</tt>, where val is an integer variable containing
the length to which you want to set the buffer. But, then other limits may
come into play. Each host along the route from sender to receiver will
have a maximum packet size that it will pass along. The Path Maximum
Transmission Unit (PMTU) is the minimum of all of these. If the message
(plus any IP and SCTP headers) is larger than the PMTU, it will be
fragmented and delivered in pieces. The sender can guard against this
by setting the SCTP option SCTP_DISABLE_FRAGMENTS so that a message is
delivered as a single entity or not at all, but this typically will only
decrease the maximum possible message size.
</p><p>
The receiver of a message also has a receiving buffer size, which is
controlled by the socket option SO_RCVBUF. It will not receive messages
larger than this&mdash;fragmenting them if necessary. The major problem from
the receiving side is how to deal with fragmented messages. The system
calls read() and recv() do not contain any information about message
boundaries, as they are byte-oriented. Fortunately, SCTP has a new
system call, sctp_recvmsg(), which returns status information about the
read in an integer parameter. In particular, if the MSG_EOR bit (message
end-of-record) is set, read of a message has been completed. If it
is not set, the message has been fragmented and more of the message
needs to be read. This can be used by the reader to build up a complete
message before processing it.
</p><p>
Listing 3 shows how the sctp_recvmsg() call can be used to receive
fragmented messages and build them up into a complete message. It does
so by reading each part of a message as it comes in and adding it to
the parts already received. When a part arrives with the MSG_EOR bit

IPv6</h2></div></div><p>
SCTP has full support out of the box for IPv6 as
well as IPv4. You simply
need to use IPv6 socket addresses instead of IPv4 socket addresses. If you
create an IPv4 socket, SCTP will deal only with IPv4 addresses. But,
if you create an IPv6 socket, SCTP will handle both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article provides a brief introduction to the IETF Stream Control
Transmission Protocol and explains how it can be used as a replacement
for TCP. In future articles, we will examine additional features
of SCTP and show their use.
