University of Maryland's Parallel Processing Chip</h2></div></div><p>
Researchers at University of Maryland's A. James Clark School
of Engineering unveiled a new, yet-unnamed prototype computer that
brings parallel processing to the desktop, increasing computing speeds
up to 100-fold. The prototype, developed by Professor Uzi Vishkin
and his team of Maryland Terrapins, utilizes a license-plate-sized
circuit board mounted with 64 parallel processors. Further, Vishkin
et al. developed the parallel-computer organization that allows the 64
processors to work together and make programming practical and intuitive
for software developers. Although parallel processing has long been common
in the supercomputing space, its application to desktop systems has
been challenging due to programming complexities. However, the Vishkin
team has made it possible via its novel single-chip parallel-processing
technology. Future devices may include 1,000 processors on a single chip.
Vishkin invites the public to name his technology, with a $500 cash
prize going to the winner.

Server Technology's Sentry Modular Cabinet Power Distribution
Unit</h2></div></div><p>
The power requirements in today's datacenter have sparked innovations
like Server Technology's new Sentry Modular Cabinet Power Distribution
Unit (CDU), a family of modular solutions that enable simple, targeted
distribution of 3-phase power. Sentry CDUs take a 3-phase feed-in and
distribute single-phase power to any point in the cabinet. A single
in-feed of 3-phase 208V 30/60A or 400V 32A can provide from 10.8 to
22.2kW of power. For greater densities or for redundancy, dual in-feeds
can be provided with two modular units linked together under one IP
address, providing anywhere from 21.6 to 44.4kW of power. IP access
and security include Web interface, SSL, SSH, Telnet, SNMP, FTP, SNTP,
Syslog, LDAP, LDAPS, TACACS+ and serial RS-232 access.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They
Think</em></span> (O'Reilly
Media)</h2></div></div><p>
Want to explore your inner Leonardo da Vinci? Then, pick up O'Reilly
Media's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beautiful Code: Leading Programmers Explain How They
Think</em></span>, a compilation of thought-provoking essays that illuminate the
artistry involved in crafting software. Edited by Andy Oram and Greg
Wilson, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beautiful Code</em></span> presents wide-ranging contributions from 38
pioneering software designers who aim to &ldquo;rouse and inspire a new
generation of coders&rdquo; by sharing their most closely held secrets.
For example, contributor Ronald Mak expounds on his elegant approach
to NASA's Mars Rover, and Arun Mehta focuses on the importance of
making technology useful to the disabled. Editors Oram and Wilson
call the essays from such gifted inventors &ldquo;inspiring and even
uplifting&rdquo;. All royalties from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beautiful
Code</em></span> will be donated to Amnesty
International.

Paradigma Software's Valentina Community Database Server</h2></div></div><p>
We at <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> relish the torrent of ports to Linux, and we extend a warm
welcome to a new arrival, Paradigma Software's Valentina Community Server
3.1 (VCS). VCS is a free and reportedly &ldquo;very fast&rdquo; Linux-based SQL
database server whose kernel architecture is built for speed and can
be optimized to allow &ldquo;fewer and much smaller tables compared to other
servers&rdquo;, says Paradigma. In addition to standard features, Valentina
offers link refactoring commands, improved binary links (over ObjectPtrs)
and object-relational design that &ldquo;doesn't force one into a particular
design pattern&rdquo;. Support for PHP 4.0 and higher is included, and Ruby
support is on its way. Mac OS X and Windows versions also are available.

CentricCRM's Centric Team Elements</h2></div></div><p>
A preview edition (Version 0.9) of CentricCRM's forthcoming Centric Team
Elements suite is now available for public consumption. Centric Team
Elements is an open-source, Java-based Enterprise 2.0
application&mdash;that is,
one that unifies Web 2.0 tools such as wikis, blogs and RSS feeds
into one unified, relational database-driven application. For instance,
a company department can set up wikis and blogs, track project plans
and establish RSS feeds with departmental news&mdash;and, all information
is indexed and searchable. Centric Team Elements also shares the same
architecture as CentricCRM, an open-source CRM application, allowing
seamless integration with a company's front-office operations. The 1.0
production release is slated for Q3 2007.

SourceKibitzer's Bio Service for Java Developers</h2></div></div><p>
SourceKibitzer, an established resource for Java developers working in
open source, recently added a free Bio Service for enhancing professional
opportunities. The Bio Service creates an on-line &ldquo;resume&rdquo; that includes
11 objective achievement metrics related to both the developer and
software created. These metrics allow developers to market
their contributions and real-world skills accurately to the Open Source community.
The service also includes the ability to network within a larger community
where members learn, interact, collaborate and compare their skills and
experiences with one another.
