Ditch the funky USB cable and connect to your cell phone and other
devices with Bluetooth.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d72f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many modern cell phones can take pictures and short
video clips. This is great for taking candid photos and sharing
them with friends and family at a later time. Modern cell phones also
commonly have replaceable themes
and ringtones, which are, in essence, 30-second audio clips. On newer
phones, ringtones often are MP3 files, replacing older, nonstandard
formats. According to many wireless providers, the only way to get your
media off the phone is to e-mail yourself using the provider's data transfer
service. This can become rather expensive, especially if you take a lot of
photos. Some cell phones come with a standard USB connection and can be
mounted as USB mass storage devices. Many cell phones, including
the phone I currently own (Motorola V551), utilize a nonstandard USB
connection. So, instead of purchasing a specialized USB cable, I decided
to connect to it using a standard USB Bluetooth dongle. The dongle should
work with any phone that supports the Bluetooth protocol.
</p><p>
Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol that enables transfer
speeds of up to 3Mbps and up to 100 meters in distance. It's currently used
in various devices, such as printers, keyboards, mice, wireless headsets
and GPS receivers. The Bluetooth specification was first developed in
1994 by Ericsson Mobile Platform engineers Sven Mattison and Jaap
Haartsen,
and it has been adopted as a standard by more than 6,000 companies worldwide. Most
modern cell phones now include some sort of Bluetooth wireless capability.
</p><p>
By using Bluetooth, you can push and pull files to and from a cell
phone, which is handy if you want to archive photos taken with
your cell phone and don't want to pay $.25 or more to e-mail yourself
each file. This also allows you to create ringtones from songs that
you own in MP3 format (many cell phones let you play standard
MP3 audio files). And, some users will be able to connect to the Internet via
PPP and other utilities. In this article, we mostly are concerned with
the tools available in Linux to access files on your Bluetooth-enabled
cell phone. This includes the low-level command-line utilities as
well as the GUI applications available under KDE and GNOME. Comparable
functionality from a proprietary Windows/Mac application will cost you
anywhere from $15&ndash;$40 US.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d75b0"></a>
Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Besides having a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone, you need to have
a Bluetooth connection for your computer. Many newer laptops come with
an internal Bluetooth card, although most desktops do not. If you don't
have
built-in Bluetooth capability, you need to purchase some sort of
Bluetooth transmitter. The most common are USB 1.1 and 2.0 dongles, which
are available from retail electronics outlets and mobile phone vendors. I
purchased a D-Link DBT-120 Bluetooth dongle for roughly $25 US. Even though
Bluetooth is an industry standard, it's probably a good idea to check
hardware-compatibility lists to make sure a particular model will work
under Linux. The DBT-120 supports speeds of 723Kbps asymmetrical and
433Kbps symmetrical. Although not blazingly fast, these speeds are reasonable
for small file transfers. Newer dongle models will give you up to
3Mbps. 
</p><p>
In the past, Linux users would have to recompile their kernel
to get the Bluetooth modules working correctly. Fortunately, almost all
newer distributions of Linux now come with Bluetooth enabled in
the kernel by default.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d7768"></a>
BlueZ Command-Line Tools</h2></div></div><p>
The BlueZ package is the default toolset for Bluetooth in Linux. You
may need to install the Bluetooth utilities before you get started.
In Debian, for example, you should install the bluez-utils package at
the very least.
</p><p>
Once you have your Bluetooth dongle connected to your machine, you should
check whether all the kernel modules are loading correctly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@host#  lsmod | grep blue
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d7920"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, you should see something like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bluetooth              41060  14 hidp,rfcomm,l2cap,hci_usb
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@host# dmesg | grep Blue
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d7b30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which should produce something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Bluetooth: Core ver 2.8
Bluetooth: HCI device and connection manager initialized
Bluetooth: HCI socket layer initialized
Bluetooth: HCI USB driver ver 2.9
Bluetooth: L2CAP ver 2.8
Bluetooth: L2CAP socket layer initialized
Bluetooth: RFCOMM socket layer initialized
Bluetooth: RFCOMM TTY layer initialized
Bluetooth: RFCOMM ver 1.7
Bluetooth: HIDP (Human Interface Emulation) ver 1.1
</pre>
</p><p>
Everything looks good. Next, you'll need some information about your system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@host# hciconfig -a
</pre>
</p><p>
The above spits out a bunch of lines. You are looking for this line in
particular:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Name: 'BlueZ mycomputername'
</pre>
</p><p>
In some cases, you won't see the BlueZ portion, and the computer name
may have a trailing -0.
</p><p>
Next, open the file /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf with your favorite text
editor,
and change the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
name "BlueZ %h (%d)";
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d7ef8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
name "BlueZ mycomputername";
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, create a PIN for the computer to access the cell
phone. Open the 
/etc/bluetooth/pin file,
and add the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PIN:1234
</pre>
</p><p>
The actual PIN number can be anything you like, and it may not be
included in a separate file, depending on your distribution. It may be
part of your hcid.conf file and called a passkey instead of a PIN.
</p><p>
The reason for the PIN number is that Bluetooth devices need to be paired
or tethered together. This is a standard Bluetooth security measure to
prevent unwanted connections between devices. The first time you connect
to your phone via Bluetooth, the phone notifies you that a connection
is being attempted and prompts you for a PIN number. If the PIN
number entered on the phone does not match the PIN in the configuration
file, the connection will be rejected. Most cell phones will give you
the option to connect devices automatically on subsequent connections
or prompt for intervention.
</p><p>
Next, restart the Bluetooth server on the connecting computer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@host# /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Some cell phones have a &ldquo;Find Me&rdquo; mode that needs to be turned on when
scanning. Take a look in your particular phone's Bluetooth connection
menu. Now, you're ready to see if the Bluetooth dongle can see your cell
phone or any other nearby devices with Bluetooth capability. So, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@host# hcitool scan
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d8370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which returns the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Scanning ...
        00:0F:86:89:EC:3D       Blackberry 7290
        00:14:9A:C9:BB:62       Motorola Phone
        00:16:CB:2A:7D:DB     Mac_1
</pre>
</p><p>
Each device name is listed with its MAC address. 
</p><p>
Mac_1 is my USB Bluetooth dongle. Motorola Phone is the name I have
designated in the phone's Bluetooth setup menus. BlackBerry 7290 is a
nearby device that the my dongle is picking up as well.
</p><p>
Another useful command is <tt  >sdptool search DUN</tt>. This
provides detailed
information for your device:

<pre     class="programlisting">

</p><p>
Now, you're ready to start pushing and pulling files to/from your cell
phone. Let's investigate the available tools in both KDE and GNOME.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d86e0"></a>
KDE Bluetooth Framework</h2></div></div><p>
The KDE Bluetooth framework is built on the BlueZ stack and can
utilize all the functionality of the command-line tools in an intuitive
GUI interface. Originally, it was an add-on application, but because of the
proliferation of Bluetooth devices, it has been merged into the baseline
KDE desktop. The easiest way to access your data is through the Konqueror
file manager. Once the Bluetooth dongle is plugged in to your computer, you
should see the Bluetooth icon appear on the Kicker panel. Open Konqueror,
and enter <tt  >bluetooth:///</tt> in the navigation toolbar.
</p><p>
You should see a listing of nearby devices that are Bluetooth-enabled
(Figure 1). Click on your phone, and you should see a listing of
available services (Figure 2). For pushing and pulling files, we're
most concerned with OBEX File Transfer and OBEX Object Push. Selecting
OBEX File Transfer shows the media file folders residing on your
device (Figure 3). In my case, I have separate folders for audio,
pictures and video clips. Clicking on any of the folders should reveal
the files currently on your device. Now you simply can copy/move a file to
your home folder on your computer by doing a copy and paste in Konqueror. The
first time you do this, you'll be prompted for a PIN number on the cell
phone. Subsequent file transfers will not require a PIN 
unless it has been specified in the cell phone's Bluetooth setup. If you
want to copy files from your computer to your device,
select OBEX Object Push.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9466f1.large.jpg"><img src="9466f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 3. The obex option is where you can launch the OBEX Object
Push client.
</p></div></div><p>
The system displays a pop-up asking if you want to open the kbluetooth
client. Select yes, and you should see your device list in the left-hand (device selector) column of the client (Figure 4). The top of
the client application shows your system folders. The right-hand
side of the screen contains a blank area that's titled Files to
send. Simply go into one of your system folders and click the file
you want to copy to your phone. Now, drag and drop it into the Files to
send pane. Click the Send button. Your phone will alert you and ask
if you want to accept the file transfer from your computer. Click yes,
and the file transfer starts (Figure 5). Once the file transfer
is complete, you should be able to find the file on your cell phone or
PDA. It doesn't get any easier than that. Konqueror once again proves
what a fantastic file manager it is.

KMobileTools</h2></div></div><p>
The KMobileTools application is still considered alpha software, but
it looks very promising. It's an add-on KDE application that lets you
back up, edit and import your cell phone's contact list to your computer
using the KAddressbook application. This lets you synchronize your
contact list on your cell phone or PDA to your e-mail contact list. You
no longer have to maintain separate contact lists for your cell phone
and e-mail clients. 
</p><p>
Another interesting feature is the ability to control
your cell phone remotely from the computer. You can have the cell phone
dial a number saved in the contact list or type in another via the
dial-out number field. You also can send SMS messages through your
cell phone. This is handy if you need to send a long message and
don't want to kill your thumbs by typing it with the phone's
keypad. KMobileTools also displays the cell phone's battery charge
percentage and signal strength status.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21cfc28"></a>
GNOME Bluetooth Subsystem</h2></div></div><p>
Not to be outdone by KDE, the GNOME desktop also provides a useful
set of tools for file transfers to your Bluetooth devices. There
is a nice GNOME-based front end to hcitool that can be started by
typing <tt  >gnome-bluetooth-admin</tt> from a terminal session. Click the Scan
button, and you should see a listing of nearby Bluetooth devices. Open
the Nautilus file manger, and type <tt  >bluetooth:///</tt> in the navigation
toolbar. An icon representing your phone or PDA should appear. Next,
open another Nautilus session, drag the icons of the files you
want to transfer and drop them onto the Bluetooth device's icon. You
should see a message on your cell phone asking if you want to accept
the files from your computer. 
You also can right-click on the icon for the file you want to send and select
Send via Bluetooth to initialize the file transfer. Once the
transfer is complete, you should see the new file on your cell
phone. 
</p><p>
Another great application is Phone Manger, which is GNOME's answer
to KMobileTools. Phone Manager lets you monitor your device's status,
send and read SMS messages to and from your phone and integrate your contact
list with Evolution's address book.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21cfe90"></a>
Creating Ringtones with Audacity</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you can push and pull files to and from your
cell phone, let's create some ringtones. Why create a custom
ringtone? You can be lazy and buy them for $2.50 US each from your
service provider, or you can have some fun, learn something new and
save yourself some money. Personally, I prefer the latter. Many newer
cell phones let you play standard MP3 files without any tweaking
whatsoever. 
</p><p>
If your phone has limited storage space, it might be prudent
to reduce the size of the audio file in Audacity. The first step is
to import your song into a new project in Audacity. Trim the song to
an approximately 30-second clip of a section of the song that you like.
Next, modify the clip so it's in mono. (This shrinks
the file size further.) Click the track's filename, and select Split Stereo
Track. Delete the right channel of the clip by clicking the X in the
upper-left corner of the track. Select the remaining channel, and click
on the down arrow next to the track name. You will see a drop-down menu
containing entries for Mono, Left Channel and Right Channel. Select
Mono. 
</p><p>
Next, you need to normalize the clip. First, press Ctrl-A
to select the whole track. Then, select the normalize entry in the
Effect drop-down menu in Audacity's main toolbar. 
</p><p>
Now, you're ready to
encode the MP3 file of your ringtone. Click File, and select Export
Selection as MP3. Take the new MP3 file and simply move it into the audio
folder on your cell phone as described earlier in the article. This is
a great method for creating customized ringtones using a FOSS application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d00a0"></a>
Using Your Cell Phone as a Modem</h2></div></div><p>
It is possible to use your Bluetooth-enabled cell phone or PDA as a
modem if it has GPRS or EDGE network capability. One caveat is that
many cell-phone providers lock this functionality out of their
phones unless the customer has a data plan with them. Data plan prices
vary significantly, depending upon how much throughput you are allowed
and which carrier you use. I obtained an introductory plan for $25 US per
month. An unlimited data plan probably costs in the range of $60 US a
month. This is a good option for road warriors who might be traveling
into areas where broadband is not readily available, but cell-phone
service is. Nowhere on my cell-phone provider's Web site did it mention
that this service is available to Linux users. However, the provider
offers a custom application for Windows users. The application provides
users with Internet access using their service. Mac OS X users were
relegated to a How-To document on the customer support Web site.
</p><p>
It was only when I requested to talk to the technical support that the
provider
openly acknowledged that connectivity under Linux was possible. I was
then provided with a custom script that calls the WvDial PPP dial-up
application. The script contained specific initialization parameters
to pass to the phone and connect to the dial-up service. The technical
support person at first claimed I would be able to use this service
only if I connected the cell phone to my laptop via a custom Motorola USB
cable. Conveniently, they sell this cable for $30 US and promptly offered to
sell it to me. I communicated that I was able to pass
data to/from my phone seamlessly using a generic Bluetooth dongle. At
this point, the
technical support person admitted that the USB cable was not necessary. I
then paid for a month's worth of service and was informed that customer
support does not offer any assistance to Linux users. Nothing new
there. Subsequently, I sent an e-mail to customer support asking
that they acknowledge on their support pages that the data service works
flawlessly with Linux. I have not heard back from them at the time of this writing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20df580.0x21d0258"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The tools available for Bluetooth devices under Linux are fairly
robust. They provide all of the functionality of similarly closed
applications available for Windows and Mac at no cost. Once again,
the Linux community should be commended for developing such great
programs. The command-line tools provide a good insight into the
protocols and services used in accessing Bluetooth devices. The GUI
applications are intuitive enough that average Linux users can put
them to good use in short order. Linux is right in the mix in the growing
field of communication devices and the applications that manage them.
