Let Django and its object-relational model do the SQL database
work for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8a580.0x10823a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past few months, this column has been examining Django, a popular
open-source Web development framework written in Python. Django 
sometimes is described as a rival to Ruby on Rails or a Python version
of Rails, but just as Python and Ruby are distinct languages, each
with its own strengths and weaknesses, Django and Rails are different
frameworks, and each has its own set of trade-offs.
</p><p>
If you have been following this series of columns about Django, 
you already have seen how to download and install the Django software,
how to create and configure a site and application, and even how to
create views (Python methods that handle the business logic) and
templates (HTML files with special rules for interpolating
variables and dynamic content). With everything we've looked at so
far, you could presumably create an interesting dynamic Web
application.
</p><p>
However, most modern Web applications have another component, a
relational database, on which they rely for data storage and
retrieval. Sure, you could store everything on the filesystem or
even in memory, but for most of us, a relational database is the
path of least resistance, ensuring the safety of our data while providing
a great deal of flexibility in retrieving it.
</p><p>
This month's column, then, looks at the ways in which Django programmers
can store and retrieve information in a database. If you have 
worked with databases only from PHP or CGI programs, you will be
surprised and impressed by the degree of automation Django
provides. If you have worked with Ruby on Rails, you 
probably will think the Django programmers are working too hard&mdash;to
which Django hackers would say that they want to have full control
over their application, rather than rely on behind-the-scenes magic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8a580.0x10826b8"></a>
Creating a Model</h2></div></div><p>
The term model in the Django world describes a Python object for
which there is a persistent state, presumably stored in a relational
database. We don't need to use models to integrate a
database into Django, but it would be difficult (not to mention
unaesthetic) if we were simply to stick SQL queries into our
templates. So instead, we use Django's built-in object-relational
mapper, working solely with objects from within our views and
templates. The mapper's job is to translate our method calls into
SQL and then translate the resulting database response into Python
objects.
</p><p>
But, before we even can create our model object, we first must have a
database table to which the object will connect. Django requires that
we define our model using Python code, describing the table's name,
fields and even some default values. 
</p><p>
If we were interested in keeping the blog application we
started last month, we probably could define our table in PostgreSQL
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Posting (
id        SERIAL    NOT NULL,
title    TEXT    NOT NULL,
body    TEXT    NOT NULL,
posted_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
But in Django, we don't create the above SQL directly. Rather, we use
Python to create it for us. For example, we can define the above
table in Django as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.db import models

class Posting(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(maxlength=30)
    body = models.TextField()
    publication_date = models.DateTimeField()
</pre>
</p><p>
Our model is a Python class, which inherits from
django.db.models.Model. We define each field with a particular type,
using objects that we imported from django.db.models. As shown
above, some of these data types can be restricted or modified from
their defaults by passing parameters. Some are defined
specifically because they have built-in limits, such as EmailField, which must be a
valid e-mail address. By defining columns with ManyToManyField and
ForeignKey objects, it's possible to define a variety of relationships
among tables.
</p><p>
The above code should be placed in models.py, a Python file that sits
within our application's directory (blog in this case), which itself
sits inside our Django site directory (mysite in this case).
Thus, the models for my blog application reside in
mysite/blog/models.py, whereas the models for a poll application
would reside in mysite/poll/models.py.
</p><p>
Notice that we don't have to define a primary key, which 
traditionally is called id and is a nonrepeating integer. (In
PostgreSQL, we set it to have a SERIAL data type, which gives the
column a default value taken from a newly created sequence object. In
MySQL, you would set the column to AUTO_INCREMENT, which has some of
the same capabilities as a sequence.) Django creates the id
column for us automatically. Django handles potential namespace
conflicts by prefacing the table name with the application name. So,
the posting table within the blog application becomes the
blog_posting table.
</p><p>
Now, how do we turn our Python code into SQL? First, we have to be
sure Django knows which database to use. If you have been
following along since my first Django article in the July 2007 issue, you already
have added the appropriate lines to settings.py, a site-wide configuration
file in which we define the database type, name, user and password.
Here are the values that I have installed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DATABASE_ENGINE = 'postgresql'
DATABASE_NAME = 'atf'
DATABASE_USER = 'reuven'
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''
DATABASE_HOST = ''
DATABASE_PORT = '5433'
</pre>
</p><p>
It's also important to check that the application is defined in
INSTALLED_APPS, a tuple of strings. On my system, INSTALLED_APPS
looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSTALLED_APPS = (
'django.contrib.auth',
'django.contrib.contenttypes',
'django.contrib.sessions',
'django.contrib.sites',
'django.contrib.admin',
'mysite.blog'
 )
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the clear namespace distinction between my application
(mysite.blog) and the applications that are included with Django
(django.contrib.*).
</p><p>
Before we turn our Python code into SQL, we first should check to make
sure it passes some basic sanity and validation checks. To do
that, we go to our site's home directory, and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py validate
</pre>
</p><p>
If all goes well, Django will report that there aren't any errors.
Now that our model has been validated, we can use it to create SQL.
The easiest way to do this is with the sqlall command to manage.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py sqlall blog
</pre>
</p><p>
This produces the SQL output for our database driver (PostgreSQL, in
this case). For example, this is the output that I see on my system:


<pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "blog_posting" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "title" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "body" text NOT NULL,
    "publication_date" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL
);
COMMIT;
</pre>
</p><p>
To their credit, the Django developers wrap the CREATE TABLE statement
between BEGIN and COMMIT, ensuring that the table creation will
take place in a transaction and will be rolled back if there is a
problem. This isn't an issue when creating only one table, but if we have several models, it's always best to leave the database
in a consistent state. 
</p><p>
One way for us to use the output from sqlall to create tables is to
copy it from the terminal window and then paste it, either into a
file or into the psql client program. But, Django provides the
syncdb utility to do this for us:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py syncdb
</pre>
</p><p>
The output from this reassures us that all is well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Creating table blog_posting
Loading 'initial_data' fixtures...
No fixtures found.
</pre>
</p><p>
And, sure enough, now we can see that our table has been added:


<pre     class="programlisting">
atf=# \d blog_posting
 id               | integer               | not null
                default nextval('blog_posting_id_seq'::regclass)
 title            | character varying(30) | not null
 body             | text                  | not null
 publication_date |  timestamp with time zone | not null
Indexes:
"blog_posting_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Voil&agrave;!</em></span> We now have a model that we can access via Python methods, but
that exists in our relational database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8a580.0x10831b8"></a>
Inserting Data</h2></div></div><p>
Now that our data model is in place, let's see how we can work with
it. Given that our model is brand new, and that there is no data
currently stored in it, let's begin by adding some data to it.
</p><p>
In last month's column, we saw how each URL request in Django results
in the invocation of a method. Which method is invoked depends on the
settings of urls.py, a site-wide configuration file that tells Django
what application and method should be associated with what URL.
</p><p>
One way to add data to our blog database, and to get some practice
working with the various components of Django, is to do so via a view
and template. Normally, I would demonstrate how to do this with an
HTML form, but for space reasons, I use a simpler (and more
contrived) way, inserting dummy data into the database.
</p><p>
The first step is to add a new line to the definition of the
urlpatterns variable, defined in urls.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
('^blog/add_dummy_data', 'mysite.blog.add_dummy_data')
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we can go to the URL /blog/add_dummy_data,
and Django will invoke the blog.add_dummy_data method. The beginning
of this method is quite simple, namely:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def add_dummy_data(request):
</pre>
</p><p>
The name of the method is obvious from the configuration file. The
number of parameters is determined by the number of parenthesized
groups in urlpatterns. 
</p><p>
Now what do we do? If we were dealing with raw SQL, I would suggest
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Posting
    (title, body, posted_at)
VALUES
    ('Dummy 1 headline', 'This is my first blog post',
        NOW - interval '1 hour');

INSERT INTO Posting
    (title, body, posted_at)
VALUES
    ('Dummy 2 headline', 'This is my second blog post',
        NOW());
</pre>
</p><p>
These will insert two rows into the Posting file: the first with a
timestamp from one hour ago and the second with a current timestamp.
</p><p>
But, we don't want to use SQL. We want to use Python, creating objects
that automatically map to these INSERT statements. So, it makes
sense that all we have to do is create new instances of the Posting
object, passing it appropriate parameters. And, sure enough, we can do
that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
p = Posting(title='Dummy 1 headline', body='This is my 
first blog post', posted_at=(datetime.now() 
- timedelta(0, 0, 0, 0, 1)))
p.save()

p = Posting(title='Dummy 2 headline', body='This is my 
second blog post', posted_at=datetime.now())
p.save()
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are an experienced Python programmer, the above code
shouldn't be very surprising at all. We simply are creating two new
instances of Posting, passing arguments that will set the object's
attributes. Then, we invoke the save() method on each posting, which
presumably saves the posting to disk. 
</p><p>
Finally, we finish our method with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
return HttpResponse("Created blog posts.")
</pre>
</p><p>
With the method (shown in Listing 1) defined, start up
the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py runserver  69.55.232.87:8000
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, point the Web browser to the URL defined in urls.py,
and get the message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Created blog posts.
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, check the database, just to be sure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
atf=# \x
Expanded display is on.

atf=# select * from blog_posting;

-[ RECORD 1 ]----+------------------------------
id               | 1
title            | Dummy 1 headline
body             | This is my first blog post
publication_date | 2007-06-15 16:13:34.609396-05

-[ RECORD 2 ]----+------------------------------
id               | 2
title            | Dummy 2 headline
body             | This is my second blog post
publication_date | 2007-06-15 16:14:34.675235-05
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, we were able to create these new objects successfully
and store them in the database.

    p.save()

    return HttpResponse("Created blog posts.")
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8a580.0x1083c60"></a>
Retrieving Data</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we've created these objects, let's see if we can retrieve and
display them&mdash;a pretty typical thing to do if you
write applications in Django. Because the most common thing you
might want to do with a blog is display all of the postings in reverse
chronological order, we write our index method to
do that. If you still don't have an entry in urls.py for index, 
make sure there is a line that looks like the following in the
definition of urlpatterns:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(r'^blog/$', 'mysite.blog.views.index'),
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we open up views.py to create our index method. The first
task in that method is to get all the postings. Django makes
that trivially easy to do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
postings = Posting.objects.all()
</pre>
</p><p>
This retrieves all the instances of Posting (which happen to be
stored as rows in our database) and assigns them to the variable
postings. This variable isn't a list, but an instance of a QuerySet
object. We most likely will want to iterate over the QuerySet, but we
can perform other operations on it, such as reordering it or
retrieving selected elements. 
</p><p>
We also can select particular items from the database. This is done
with two methods: one called filter (which returns objects that
match a restrictive function) and one called except (which does the
opposite, returning objects that are false for a function). Both
filter and except take a large number of parameters, built up
dynamically by joining column names with various functions. The
column name and function name are joined with a double underscore
(__).

</p><p>
For example, we can get only those postings from this year:

<pre     class="programlisting">
this_year_postings = Posting.objects.filter(
    publication_date__gte=datetime(2007, 1, 1))
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, this returns both of our postings. Because filter and
except return QuerySet objects, we can chain them together, creating
just the query we want in Python code.
</p><p>
But, what if we want only the most recent posting? If you're thinking
there will be a &ldquo;limit&rdquo; feature, you've been working at the
SQL level (or in Rails) for too long. Because QuerySets use lazy
evaluation, you simply can say:


<pre     class="programlisting">
this_year_postings = Posting.objects.filter(
    publication_date__gte=datetime(2007, 1, 1))[0]
</pre>
</p><p>
We similarly can order our objects by using the order_by method on
them, which can be chained along with filter and exclude:


<pre     class="programlisting">
latest_posting = Posting.objects.filter(
    publication_date__gte=datetime(2007, 1, 
1)).order_by('-publication_date')[0]
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that we put a minus sign (-) before the word
publication_date. This tells Django we want to order the
results in reverse.
</p><p>
Django has a wealth of such methods, giving both a great deal of
flexibility in constructing your queries and a rich Python API that
allows you to ignore the low-level SQL calls almost entirely.
</p><p>
Finally, we can get information out of our object as we would
retrieve it from any Python object:


<pre     class="programlisting">

output += "&lt;h1&gt;%s&lt;/h1&gt;\n" % posting.title
output += "&lt;h2&gt;%s&lt;/h2&gt;\n" % posting.publication_date.isoformat()
output += "&lt;p&gt;%s&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n" % posting.body

</pre>
</p><p>
If we put this all together, as shown in Listing 2, we'll have a view method
(albeit without a proper Django template) that shows each of the blog
postings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf8a580.0x107ade0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. views.py, with an Index Method</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

from django.template import Context, loader
from django.http import HttpResponse

from blog.models import Posting
from datetime import *

def index(request):
    postings = Posting.objects.all().order_by("-publication_date")
    output = ""

    for posting in postings:
        output += "&lt;h1&gt;%s&lt;/h1&gt;\n" % posting.title
        output += "&lt;h2&gt;%s&lt;/h2&gt;\n" % posting.publication_date.isoformat()
        output += "&lt;p&gt;%s&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n" % posting.body

    return HttpResponse(output)

</pre></div><p>
You can try all of these database queries for yourself using Django's
shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py shell
</pre>
</p><p>
Using the Django shell, as opposed to the straight interactive Python
interface, ensures that Django-related classes and paths are
preloaded, making it possible to query and modify the
database from within Python interactively. This is a good way to experiment with
new code that you are thinking of adding to a view method, without
having to place it in a file.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Django provides a high-level interface for the definition of database
models using Python, rather than SQL. This high-level API permeates
the framework, making it possible to work exclusively in Python.
Moreover, the API includes many convenience functions and data types
that make it relatively natural to work in this way. Creating
database-backed Web applications with Django is dramatically easier
and better than with most frameworks I've used, although it is similar
in style to Ruby on Rails. Whether you should use Django or Rails is
a matter of personal taste and also depends on what others in your organization
are using, but there's no doubt that if you're a Python Web/database
hacker, Django is worth a very serious look.
