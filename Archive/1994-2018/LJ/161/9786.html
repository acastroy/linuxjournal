<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #161, September 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>UMSDOS</b></span>, once a proud gateway into the Linux world for MS-DOS users,
has been gone from the kernel for a while, and now even its dregs are
being culled, bit by bit. <span   class="bold"><b>Jesper Juhl</b></span> has posted patches to remove the
configuration entries from kconfig, as well as the ioctls UMSDOS had
used. But, it turns out we still can't get rid of the ioctls, because
the software of the future must know not to reuse the numbers. So,
like DevFS, it may be impossible to remove all evidence of
UMSDOS fully.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has released <span   class="bold"><b>PowerTOP</b></span>, a standalone utility to help identify how
much power is being used by the various applications and other parts
of the system, including kernel drivers. The goal is to help
all software developers trim down their power usage to 
extend laptop uptime greatly. <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan van de
Ven</b></span>, who announced the project on
the linux-kernel mailing list, said that on a test laptop Intel had
been able to increase battery life by more than an hour.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Jones</b></span> has posted a patch to
undeprecate the <span   class="bold"><b>Raw I/O driver</b></span>. This
driver is no longer needed because users simply can open the target
device with the O_Direct flag. But evidently, there is a significant
number of users who are just not in a position to change their
software. So, even though a better method exists, it looks like the Raw
driver will be sticking around for the foreseeable future. Even
listing it as obsolete is now a no-no, because, as Dave says, it would
just lead someone to add the driver to the &ldquo;to be removed&rdquo; list, which
would start up the whole discussion again.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Geert Uytterhoeven</b></span> posted patches for a
<span   class="bold"><b>Flash ROM storage driver</b></span> for
the <span   class="bold"><b>PS3</b></span>. This seemed to be a welcome set of patches, with no
significant technical obstacles.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jesse Barnes</b></span> at <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span>, working with the <span   class="bold"><b>Framebuffer</b></span> developers, is
attempting to change the way graphics are handled in the
Linux world completely. They want to enhance the kernel's graphics support to
enable full-featured non-X Window System graphics capabilities to Linux. As
it turns out, this is a very controversial project, and it represents
another in a long line of attempts to replace the X Window System. The problems
with such a project are enormous, not the least of which will be that any
alternative to the X Window System will have to provide a competitive set of
features, making it at least as large as the X Window System itself. This
prospect will never appeal to kernel developers who feel that a small,
sleek kernel is best. But, it's also true that graphics devices have
been a strange exception to the general rule that hardware controllers
belong in the kernel. It'll be very interesting to see how this
particular attempt at a kernel graphics system plays out.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rob Landley</b></span> has decided to reorganize a
bit of the <span   class="bold"><b>Documentation
directory</b></span>, creating a directory for the <span   class="bold"><b>Amiga architecture</b></span>, and
putting arm, cris, blackfin, parisc, powerpc, s390, x86_64 and uml
into that directory. While he was at it, he moved the Multiport Serio
IO cards into the serial directory.

The question at this point is whether the name Chumby will come to stand
for every other hackable pillow-like device. (Such was the fate of
Kleenex and Escalator.) If all goes according to plan, Chumbys should be
on the market by now. Prototypes and development versions have been
circulating for about a year, and a sizable development community has
grown around it. Given how much it has grown and changed in the public
womb, there's no telling how it'll evolve out in meatspace.

&ldquo;Chumby Industries was formed by hackers who wanted to create something
interesting, useful and different. The starting point was the humble
clock radio&rdquo;, its creators explain. Since then, Chumby has evolved from a
clock in a cushion to an Any-purpose Net-native Linux device. That's
any with a capital A, because the Chumby is built to be hackable at
every level, including the physical. Not only does it sense motions and
squeezings, but it also hosts an assortment of charms, through its &ldquo;outerware
API&rdquo;. The charms and much more about the Chumby were designed by Susan
Kare (who designed the original desktop icons for the Macintosh and
Windows, among too many other things to mention). Susan is Creative
Director for Chumby. The company might be cuddly, but it means business
too.

<h2 class="title">The World Continues to Await Dell Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #161, September 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Dell's IdeaStorm site opened earlier this year to a hurricane of strong
input from the Linux community. As we reported in the June 2007 issue, nearly
all of the top ten vote-getters among new ideas for the company were
Linux- or open-source-related. Since then, Dell has committed to making
Linux-based desktops and laptops, and it offers a nice array of product
choices based on Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu distros&mdash;in the US, that is.
</p><p>
The top topic on the IdeaStorm site as of mid-June 2007 was &ldquo;Sell Linux PCs
Worldwide&mdash;not only the United States&rdquo;. It has more than 24,000 votes. Next
in line was &ldquo;Dell Ubuntu for Europe&rdquo;, with 11,370 votes. Other items on
the same page were &ldquo;Ubuntu Dell Must Cost Le$$ Than Windows
Dell&rdquo;, &ldquo;Same
discounts available on Ubuntu and Windows&rdquo;, &ldquo;Provide Linux Drivers for
all your Hardware&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pre-Installed OpenOffice.org | alternative to MS Works
&amp; MS Office&rdquo;, &ldquo;Have Firefox pre-installed as default
browser&rdquo; and &ldquo;TV
Commercial for New Ubuntu PCs&rdquo;.
</p><p>
For its part, Dell says it is simply starting in the US and is &ldquo;still
working out details of its global programme&rdquo;. Support in languages other
than English is an issue. Look up &ldquo;linux&rdquo; at <a href="http://www.google.com/trends" target="_self">www.google.com/trends</a>, and
you'll find the top country sources of Linux searches are Czech
Republic, Russia, Bulgaria, Indonesia, India, Slovakia, Romania,
Ukraine, Hungary and Poland. You'll find similar results with searches for any
of the distros. The US isn't in the top ten for any of them.
</p><p>
There's also room for improvement in the US. Dell still buries Linux
details deep in its Web site. Although plenty of pages are devoted to
Linux or Linux-related products, the word &ldquo;linux&rdquo; cannot be found on the
home page or any pages up to two layers down the Dell site schema&mdash;not
even in the pages for enterprise servers (as it is, say, for HP). Yet,
there are plenty of &ldquo;Dell recommends Windows Vista&mdash;Home
Premium&rdquo;
messages at the tops of Dell product pages.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Michael Dell's interest doesn't seem to be flagging. As of press
time, the top computer
on Michael's list is still a Dell Precision M90 running Ubuntu 7.04
Feisty Fawn

There's really only one rule for community as far as I'm concerned, and
it's this&mdash;in order to call some gathering of people a
&ldquo;community&rdquo;, it
is a requirement that if you're a member of the community, and one day
you stop showing up, people will come looking for you to see where you
went.

Every Web service has ended up being its own little snowflake, needing
its own special treatment. The thing is, it's better than nothing so we
trudge along and build the client libraries anyway.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Les Orchard says each API is a snowflake that every developer has to
build custom interfaces for. Someday all these guys will realize they
need to get together and come up with some standards for serializing
data to simplify the work for themselves and developers. A lot of
compromise and working together will be needed to make this happen. And
when they have finished, many years from now, they will be where we were
with XML-RPC in 1998.
