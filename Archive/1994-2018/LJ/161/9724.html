The Nokia N800 starts off the N-series of Linux handhelds with an
indisputable winner.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b87580.0x1c7f500"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last year's winner in this category, the Nokia 770, has a younger
sibling, and, as oft happens, the kid takes the cake. Nokia's N800, the
follow-up to the 770, is smaller, lighter, better-looking, faster and has
a larger brain.

</p><p>
Although the N800 bears a high resemblance to its older sibling and
retains the overall layout, excellent 802.11 and Bluetooth radios and
razor-sharp 4.1", 800x480, 225 pixel/inch color touchscreen of the 770,
many things have changed, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Built-in stereo speakers, instead of a single speaker.
</p></li><li><p>
Better microphone positioning.
</p></li><li><p>
The addition of a 640x480 Webcam.
</p></li><li><p>
The addition of an FM receiver.
</p></li><li><p>
An upgrade to USB 2.0 connectivity.
</p></li><li><p>
Two full-size SD card slots with a supported capacity of 2GB each,
(in testing, a 4GB card worked).
</p></li><li><p>
Instead of the 770's single RS-MMC slot, a faster CPU (TI OMAP
2420 at 330MHz vs. the 770's OMAP 1710 at 220MHz), yielding about
twice the performance of the 770.
</p></li><li><p>
Twice the RAM (128MB).
</p></li><li><p>
Four times the internal Flash (256MB).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Overall, the appearance of the N800 is fantastic. It looks like a
finished product, while the 770 had a &ldquo;prototype&rdquo;
look. This attention to
detail is obvious&mdash;from the newly designed aluminum front cover down to
the built-in stand that locks at both 45 and 90 degrees. It even
includes the little touches of chrome and lettering on the slide-out stylus.
</p><p>
Yet, even with all the additional functionality, the N800 is smaller
(5.7"
x 3.0" x 0.5") and lighter (7.3 ounces) than the 770 (5.5" x 3.1" x
0.7" and 8.1 ounces). The VGA resolution Webcam is accessed via a
pop-out button on the left side of the screen.
</p><p>
One feature we miss is the reversible hard-shell cover, which served as
a screen protector when closed. If Nokia (or someone else) offered one
as an accessory, we would buy it. In addition, we found the smaller
buttons on the top somewhat more difficult to manipulate.
</p><p>
The N880's software also is upgraded from the 770's. The company
continues to ship a Debian-based distribution, with Hildon widgets, now
updated as Internet Tablet Edition 2007. Improvements include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Updated Opera 8 browser with Flash 7 support.
</p></li><li><p>
Jabber-based IM, including VoIP and video conferencing.
</p></li><li><p>
Improvements to the connectivity manager so it remembers your
connectivity preferences.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to use part of the internal SD card as swap,
increasing virtual memory.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Nokia has announced (via the Maemo Project) a road map, including GTK
2.10, Samba, Bluetooth headset support, USB host support, Skype and
improvements to the built-in e-mail client.
</p><p>
We continue to be impressed by the range of the N800's Wi-Fi chipset. It
nearly always picks up APs (access points) that most notebook computers
fail even to see. When a Wi-Fi connection is available, you can use the
Bluetooth radio to gain access to the Internet via a cell phone. When we
received the Nokia N800 to review, it included settings for connecting
to Cingular. One of us (Doc) has a Nokia E62 mobile phone with a
Cingular data plan, and his N800 review unit got on the Net with no
trouble at all.
</p><p>
But, your mileage may vary. To perform the required setup manually,
select Tools&rarr;Control Panel from the Application menu, navigate to
Connectivity, double-tap it, edit the connection titled Cingular
Internet, tap Next, and then enter the following connection information:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Access Point Name: wap.cingular.
</p></li><li><p>
Dial-up Number: *99***1# (this is unchanged).
</p></li><li><p>
User Name: WAP.CINGULARGPRS.COM.
</p></li><li><p>
Password: CINGULAR1 (also unchanged).
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, tap Finished.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you're a US T-Mobile customer, the access point name is one of these:
internet.voicestream.com, internet2.voicestream.com or
internet3.voicestream.com, depending on your plan and region. The
user name and password fields are blank for T-Mobile.
</p><p>
After you get this set up, power-cycle your phone, and you should be
connected. Some phones (such as the E62) want you to approve making the
connection. After clicking yes on the phone, you're on the Net. Although
connectivity over GPRS isn't as fast as Wi-Fi, it's still a lot of fun to
be able to pop up your favorite Web site at the beach. (And, both of your
authors live by beaches&mdash;Jim in Hawaii and Doc in Santa Barbara. Your
recreational options may vary.)
</p><p>
Unannounced&mdash;but recently discovered by the Nokia N800
community&mdash;the
device has a built-in FM stereo tuner. Enabling this is as simple as
updating the apt-based application catalog and searching for the FM
receiver tool. Download it, and you're set once you plug in the headphones
for use as an antenna. (FM waves are much longer than cell-phone
waves, so you need a conductor up to 30" long or so.) You can configure
the FM widget to play through the speakers, though this setting is not
retained in the version we tested. (It defaults to the earphones.)
Reception is about the same as you'd expect from a Walkman-type radio.
One obvious omission we would like to see corrected: the NXP (n&eacute;e,
Philips) TEA5761 FM receiver could be upgraded to a TEA5764, which
includes RDS (Radio Data Service). That's the data stream that runs in
the background with many US FM stations as well as all stations in Europe
and many others around the world. For the N800, it would allow the FM
tuner to identify stations, programs and music information. (Right now,
on the FM tuner widget, you have to enter call letters manually for all
your presets.) More important, RDS support would allow applications to
be built that make use of data on the RDS stream. These include song or
program title (date and timestamped) and other identifying information.
Through ProjectVRM (which Doc heads at Harvard's Berkman Center),
discussions already have begun toward making the N800 an interactive
FM/streaming/podcasting device&mdash;one that could include a &ldquo;buy
button&rdquo;
that allows listeners instantly to become contributors to (and members
of) public radio stations playing programs that listeners like. This
opt-in orientation toward paying for radio (and podcasting) has the
potential to revolutionize the whole business.
</p><p>
We even could use opt-in payments to fix commercial music radio. The
Copyright Royalty Board earlier this year came up with a ruling that
said every station on the Web would have to pay a tiny
per-person/per-song fee (which increases to $.0019 each by 2010). While
the Royalty Board and its predecessors (going back to the DMCA in 1998)
spoke about a &ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo; marketplace with a &ldquo;willing buyer and
willing seller&rdquo;, the N800 actually makes such a marketplace possible,
but on a completely voluntary, natural basis. Listeners pay only for
what they like, in any amount they like, whenever they like. They can
subscribe, escrow the data for use (including payment) at a later time
or whatever. The key is providing a low-friction way of listening and
paying without any coercion on the supply side&mdash;a way to blow up DRM by
turning stations and podcasters into true intermediaries between
performing artists and those who enjoy their work. And, wouldn't you
rather pay directly for public radio than have to listen to pledge
drives twice a year?
</p><p>
Even without that extra feature, the N800 is a big advance on
radio-as-usual. For example, you can &ldquo;time-shift&rdquo; radio, like TiVo does
for video.
</p><p>
The N800 also has both USB and line-in interfaces, allowing you to
record (and perhaps even edit) as well as play back podcasts. Simply add
software. That's a huge advantage of the N800's nature as a wide-open
Linux device.
</p><p>
One more fun thing (among many) to do with your N800 is use it as a
navigation device. Nokia sells a Navigation Kit that includes a Nokia
LD-3W Bluetooth GPS, car charger, car mounting kit, 2GB memory card and
Navicore software with maps. However, if you already have a Bluetooth
GPS, you might investigate Mameo Mapper. After you get through the
setup, you can end up with a set of maps that are based on Google Maps
(street or satellite view) or any of several other on-line map sources,
including Microsoft's excellent Virtual Earth (VE). If you enable
auto-download, these can be downloaded as needed through your cellular-phone data connection. (For more on Navicore and Maemo Mapper, see Doc's
Linux for Suits column in this issue.)
</p><p>
We found that we could get five hours of use on a single charge while doing
typical Web browsing, over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, and listening to the FM
radio. This is impressive for a device with this form factor and a Wi-Fi
radio.
</p><p>
It's still early, but it's clear that Nokia is committed to the
N-series (as it's now called) as a platform, and so are both vendors (such
as Navicore) and developers. Be sure to visit both <a href="http://maemo.org" target="_self">maemo.org</a> and
<a href="http://garage.maemo.org" target="_self">garage.maemo.org</a>, where you can see what's developed and what's
developing&mdash;and start rolling your own cool stuff for this excellent
little device.
