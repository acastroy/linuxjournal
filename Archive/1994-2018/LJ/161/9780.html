Remember that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> hands can't go to 11 or even
10
for that matter.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1263580.0x135b500"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we visited the rarefied climes of the expensive private player
rooms at Monte Carlo to learn about the elite gambling game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span>. The
game is straightforward, but it's governed by a fairly complicated set
of rules.
</p><p>
At its most rudimentary though, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> has two
players: a Banker and
a Player, and each is dealt two cards, the rank of which are summed up
to calculate the winning hand.
</p><p>
Any hand worth 10 or more is divided by 10, so a 9 + 6 isn't 15, but 5,
and a hand of 3 + 4 = 7 would indeed beat it.
</p><p>
It gets complicated in the case of whether the Banker should
draw a third card. The Player can draw one card only on any
two-card point value of less than six, but the Banker can draw based
only on the Player's initial hand, the card the Player drew and the Banker's
hand value.
It works like this:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
If the Player didn't draw a card, the Banker draws a card on 0&ndash;5 and
stands otherwise.
</p></li><li><p>
If the Player drew a 2 or 3 and the Banker has a total of 0&ndash;4, the
Banker draws a card.
</p></li><li><p>
If the Player drew a 4 or 5 and the Banker has a total of 0&ndash;5, the
Banker draws a card.
</p></li><li><p>
If the Player drew a 6 or 7 and the Banker has a total of 0&ndash;6, the
Banker draws a card.
</p></li><li><p>
If the Player drew an 8 and the Banker has a total of 0&ndash;2, the Banker
draws a card.
</p></li><li><p>
If the Player drew a 9, 10, face card or ace and the Banker has a
total of 0&ndash;3, the Banker draws a card.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In all situations not detailed above, the Banker cannot draw a card, and the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> hand will end either with the Player winning, the Banker wining
or an <span   class="emphasis"><em>&eacute;galit&eacute;</em></span>, or tie.
</p><p>
As you can see, it's a set of rules that apparently could 
be loved only by a computer programmer, so it looks perfect for us to
expand the baccarat.sh game in this direction.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1263580.0x135bea0"></a>
On to the Script</h2></div></div><p>
Last month's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> game took everything into account up to, but not
including, the Banker picking a third card, with all the complicated
rules detailed above.
</p><p>
Running it as is, here's a typical sequence:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh baccarat.sh 

Welcome to Baccarat. You can choose to either 
stake the player or dealer to win this game. 
Remember, face cards are worthless and all point values
are modulo 10, with '9' the best possible hand value. 
We're using Punto Banco rules with this simulation, 
if you're already an expert...

** Player was dealt: 3 of Hearts, 10 of Clubs (hand value = 3)
** Dealer was dealt: 4 of Clubs, 10 of Spades (hand value = 4)

Player takes a card: 6 of Hearts (hand value = 12)

** Banker play rules yet to come...game ends inconclusively.
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, instead of capturing the rules, I just have a &ldquo;coming
soon&rdquo; stub. Think of it as, um, early alpha so far.
</p><p>
In fact, it's sufficiently in alpha that there's a bug displayed in the
above sequence. Can you see it? How can the Player have a hand value
of 12?
</p><p>
Fortunately, it's straightforward to see the problem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
playerhandvalue=$(( $playerhandvalue + 
    $handvalue ))
</pre>
</p><p>
This is just plain wrong. Because the line above hands all three Player
cards to the handValue function, all this needs to be is the simpler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
playerhandvalue=$handvalue
</pre>
</p><p>
Phew. Easily fixed. Now, where were we?
</p><p>
One thing that we need to ascertain easily is whether the Player
took a card. This can be done by actually testing the number of cards
in the Player hand, but instead I simply create a new variable,
playerDrewCard,
setting it to zero on initial deal and flipping it to one if
the Player takes another card.
</p><p>
Now, the first rule can be captured like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $playerDrewCard -eq 0 ] ; then
  if [ $bankerhandvalue -lt 6 ] ; then
    # Banker draws a card
    banker[$nextbankercard]=${newdeck[$nextcard]}

    handValue ${banker[1]} ${banker[2]}
      ${banker[3]}
    bankerhandvalue=$handvalue

    echo -n "Banker takes a card: "
    showCard ${banker[$nextbankercard]}
    echo "$cardname (hand value = 
      $bankerhandvalue)"
  fi
else
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice here that if the Player drew a card and the Banker's hand is worth
six or more, there is no else clause, and correctly, there is no
additional action before the end-game winner is determined.
</p><p>
The else at the bottom, however, is our gateway to the situation where
neither the Banker nor Player has an 8 or 9 (which is already captured
in the game) and where the Player took another card. Now, it's just
a set of conditionals.
</p><p>
To make things easy though, let's have the Player's drawn card's rank
handy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pdcRank=$(( ${player[3]} % 13 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, although the man page for test indicates that you
can group complicated tests logically with parentheses, pragmatic reality
demonstrates that it's far less portable than we might desire, so instead
of a nice (A or B) and C statement, we'll break each rule into two if
statements, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $pdcRank -eq 2 -o $pdcRank -eq 3 ] ; then
  if [ $bankerhandvalue -lt 5 ]; then
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, we're testing the card the Player took (card #3) and
testing that the Banker's hand is below a certain value. If both are true,
we have condition #2, above.
</p><p>
Now, it's just a matter of having a sequence of these tests in a row to
build all the rules necessary for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Punto Banco
Baccarat</em></span>.
</p><p>
In all its crazy-nested-if-statement glory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $pdcRank -eq 2 -o $pdcRank -eq 3 ] ; then
    if [ $bankerhandvalue -lt 5 ]; then
      dealBanker;
    fi
  elif [ $pdcRank -eq 4 -o $pdcRank -eq 5 ] ; then
    if [ $bankerhandvalue -lt 6 ] ; then
      dealBanker;
    fi
  elif [ $pdcRank -eq 6 -o $pdcRank -eq 7 ] ; then
    if [ $bankerhandvalue -lt 7 ] ; then
      dealBanker;
    fi
  elif [ $pdcRank -eq 8 -a $bankerhandvalue -lt 3 ]
  then
    dealBanker;
  elif [ $pdcRank -eq 9 -o $pdcRank -eq 0 ] ; then
    if [ $bankerhandvalue -lt 4 ] ; then
      dealBanker;
    fi
  fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, we can play <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> on our handy Linux
box:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; sh baccarat.sh 

Welcome to Baccarat. You can choose to either stake 
the player or banker to win this game. Remember, face 
cards are worthless and all point values are modulo 10, 
with '9' the best possible hand value. We're using Punto
Banco rules with this simulation, if you're already an expert...

** Player was dealt: 6 of Clubs, 8 of Hearts (hand value = 4)
** Banker was dealt: King of Spades, Ace of Hearts (hand value = 1)

Player takes a card: 9 of Hearts (hand value = 3)
Banker takes a card: 5 of Clubs (hand value = 6)

Play is complete. Banker wins
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, now you can run this a few million times and calculate the
odds of the Banker winning versus the Player winning versus the tie
situation and be a cool, calculated gambler next time you're in the
south of France. Helpful, eh?
