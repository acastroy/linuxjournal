was about. You installed Linux, logged in to your own Unix machine,
and are ready to race. Hmmm, strange prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~#
</pre><p>It's not quite <b  >C:&amp;gt:</b> but it can't be that
hard. You put in a floppy disk and type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# dir a:
ls: a:: No such file or directory
</pre><p>The commands and output of commands in this article assume
you are using the bash shell. Also, you do not type in the
prompt.</p><p>&ldquo;I wonder how you look at floppies?&rdquo; You type
<b  >help</b> at the prompt and get a screen full of
cryptic command templates. Nothing on <b  >dir</b>
though. Ah! There in the second column it
is&mdash;<b  >dirs</b>. &ldquo;No problem,&rdquo; you think, as you
confidently type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# dirs a:
</pre><p>...and get <b  >dirs: unknown option: a:</b>. &ldquo;Oh,
that's right,&rdquo; you mutter, &ldquo;Unix doesn't have <b  >a:</b>
and <b  >c:</b> drives. help again, and let's have a
closer look. Here we go, it says: <b  >help
[pattern...]</b> so you enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# help dir
dirs: dirs [-l]
   Display the list of currently remembered
   directories. Directories find their way
   onto the list with the `pushd' command;
   you can get back up through the list with
   the `popd' command.
   The -l flag specifies that `dirs' should not
   print shorthand versions of directories which
   are relative to your home directory. This
   means that `~/bin' might be displayed as
   /homes/bfox/bin
</pre><p>Getting a bit puzzled now you try:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# dir
total 1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root 8 Aug 2    21:39  INSTALL -&gt; /var/adm/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root 14 Aug 2   21:39  linux -&gt; /usr/src/linux/
drwx------ 2 root  root 1024 Aug 3 18:05  mail/
</pre><p>Phew, something works. What does it all mean though?
Different colours, arrows, your login name is there twice on each
file and you still don't know how to list what's on a floppy. In
fact, you're starting to wonder why you thought this Linux thing
was a good idea in the first place.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188c580.0x1984ad8"></a>Help Is on the Way</h2></div></div><p>If Linux is your first foray into the Unix world then you're
at a bit of a disadvantage compared to starting out on a commercial
system: no manuals. Fortunately, Unix has a long history of
carrying its documentation on-line. In fact, the first system I
worked on, about eleven years ago, normally shipped with only the
vendor-specific manuals in printed form and the majority of the
documentation on-line. So here's a few tips on how to discover what
you need to know without a set of printed manuals. A whistle-stop
tour of <b  >man</b>, <b  >apropos</b>,
<b  >whatis</b>, <b  >more</b> or
<b  >less</b>, <b  >ls</b> and
<b  >find</b>. Where to look for information on Usenet
other than comp.os.linux.help and where to look for information off
Usenet, as well as in <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>First stop is the helpful trinity of <b  >man</b>,
<b  >apropos</b> and <b  >whatis</b>. The most
essential of these three is <b  >man</b>.
<b  >man</b> is your access to the on-line manual set.
<b  >apropos</b> is a keywork searching tool for the
manual set, and <b  >whatis</b> is a quick reference to
commands. <b  >man</b> also has the ability to do both
the keyword searching of <b  >apropos</b> and the quick
reference of <b  >whatis</b>.</p><p>The best way to start is to try typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# man man
</pre><p>which is asking the on-line manual for the manual page on
itself. The header of the &rdquo;man&ldquo; man page has &rdquo;man(1)&ldquo; followed by a
NAME entry, a SYNOPSIS entry and then the description. The NAME
entry gives the name and a short description of the things
explained on this man page. The SYNOPSIS is a template for running
the command which shows the required format, the options, and the
parameters. The DESCRIPTION entry is the detailed description of
the command, its calling conventions, options, parameters, and
other details. Near the end of the man page are two very useful
sections, the SEE ALSO and where appropriate the FILES section. The
SEE ALSO section lists other man pages which are relevant to the
one you have just looked up. The FILES section lists files which
are relevant to the command you are looking at, for instance,
configuration files.</p><p>There are three very useful options to the man program. They
are <b  >-a</b>, <b  >-f</b>, and
<b  >-k</b>. The <b  >-a</b> option tells the
man program to not stop looking for pages at the first one it
finds, but to scan all the man page sections and present you with
all the relevant pages. You're probably now wondering what those
sections are and why they exist. The man pages themselves can help
us out with that one.</p><p>If you recall, when you typed man man the resulting man page
was headed &rdquo;man(1)&ldquo;. This means the page was found in section one
of the manual. If you now enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# man -a man
</pre><p>you will be presented with the &rdquo;man(1)&ldquo; man page again. Now
type q to leave the man page viewer. Instead of being put back to
the prompt, you will be given another man page to view, which is
headed &rdquo;man(7)&ldquo;. This is a description of the way to create man
pages and is from section seven. On about the third screen of
&rdquo;man(7)&ldquo; is a list of the various man sections. If you knew that
you just wanted to see the page on how to create man pages, you
could bypass the &rdquo;man(1)&ldquo; page by entering:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# man 7 man
</pre><p>If you remember the name of a command but can't remember what it
does, the <b  >whatis</b> command (or <b  >man
-f</b>) is what you need. These commands search a special
&rdquo;whatis&ldquo; database and return a list of matches with a short
description.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# whatis man
man (1)         - Format and display the on-line manual pages
man (7)         - Macros to format man pages
man.config (5)  - Configuration data for man
</pre><p>In this case, it also got us a pointer to another man-related
man page on which we can do a man man.config or man <b  >5
man.config</b>.</p><p>Often you'll know what you want to do, but won't know the
command name. To do a keyword search of the &rdquo;whatis&ldquo; database, you
can use either the apropos command or man <b  >-k</b>.
For example, to find out how to copy a file, neither man copy nor
whatis copy are of any help. Using either <b  >apropos
copy</b> or <b  >man -k</b> copy returns 22 lines
of matches, including the <b  >entry cp(1) - Copy
files</b>.</p><p>Another valuable way of finding information is to &rdquo;cruise the
filesystem&ldquo;. The tools you need are cd, ls, and either more or
less. Another valuable little helper is the command
<b  >find</b>.</p><p>What do I mean by &rdquo;cruise the filesystem&ldquo;? It just means to
look through the filesystem for interesting files, reading any text
files, and looking at the man pages for any executable files. You
use <b  >ls</b> to list the files and directories, cd to
move into interesting looking directories, and the pager programs
more and less to read any text files. So on my system I can
<b  >cd /usr</b> and one of the directories which I see
in the <b  >ls</b> output is called
<b  >doc</b>. When I do an <b  >ls doc</b>, I
see one of the directories is <b  >faq</b>. I do an
<b  >ls doc/faq</b> and see one of the directories is
called <b  >howto</b>. An <b  >ls</b> of the
howto directory shows me that it's got a collection of Linux HOWTO
documents. I <b  >cd /usr/doc/faq/howto</b> and then I
can, for example, <b  >more README</b> or <b  >less
Mail-HOWTO</b>.</p><p>What about executables? Let's take an example a friend of
mine had. He was having a look around when an <b  >ls
/bin</b> came up with a program called
<b  >dialog</b>. Thinking it looked interesting, he did a
<b  >man dialog</b> and found it was a program for
creating dialog boxes for use in shell scripts. About three days
later a <i  >Linux Journal</i> arrived with an article
on <b  >dialog</b> boxes. I still want to know why my
copy of man doesn't automatically cause <i  >Linux Journal</i> articles to be written.</p><p>One important caveat about cruising a filesystem: don't
randomly execute programs. Murphy's Law indicates that only data
that's important and hard to replace will be lost when you try some
innocuous-looking program. Find and read the man pages before
trying the program. If there are no man pages, then look for other
documentation. Use the <b  >find</b> command to help you
search for more information; it is a powerful and flexible command,
allowing you to do searches through a filesystem on a number of
file attributes. I'll just give you an example of searching by
name. I can look for any filenames with the string readme in them
and print the names on my screen with the following
construct:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
george:~# find / -iname `*readme*' -print
</pre><p>where <b  >find</b> is the command,
<b  >/</b> is the place to start the search,
<b  >-iname</b> means do a case-insensitive filename
search on the following string (<b  >*readme*</b>) and
<b  >-print</b> means to display the result. If I were
doing a case- sensitive search, I would replace
<b  >-iname</b> with <b  >-name</b>.
</p><p>Why don't I just do all my looking with the
<b  >find</b> command? You build a better roadmap of your
system by walking the directories, and you find things you didn't
know to search for. How can you get find to search for the HOWTO
documents when you don't know such documents exist?</p><p>A warning on the Linux documentation: all the documentation
is provided by volunteer efforts and, since many people find
writing documentation not as much fun as writing programs,
inevitably there will be times when the on-line documentation isn't
complete. There may be a program without a man page or other
documentation. The documentation may be out of date, or there may
be inaccuracies. So be prepared for some inconsistencies. Another
thing to be aware of is that the placement of files in a
distribution is entirely up to the person creating the
distribution. Where they think the files should be, which is how
it's documented in the man page, may not be where they actually are
in your distribution. The name of the file is unlikely to have been
changed, so it's simple enough to use find to resolve such
differences.</p><p>Programs for which there are no man pages aren't so simple.
However, Linux is a type of Unix. There are many books published on
Unix and most of those would be relevant to a Linux system. There
are books on learning to use Unix, Unix reference books, and Unix
system administration books from publishers such as O'Reilly and
Associates, The Waite Group, and others. In addition I would
strongly recommend one of SSC's Unix command summaries. These
summaries are like having your &rdquo;whatis" database extended to
include both the synopsis and the options from the man page and to
have them printed out.</p><p>If you have access to Usenet news, then you probably already
look at one or more of the Linux discussion groups. In addition to
those groups, there are many other Unix discussion groups in the
comp.unix hierarchy. There are regular postings to news.answers of
many Unix FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions); in particular, there
is a Unix books FAQ. There are newsgroups on news readers
(news.software.readers), on editors (comp.editors, comp.emacs), on
mail (comp.mail hierarchy), and many other topics, so don't limit
yourself to just the comp.os.linux groups.</p><p>Oh, and if you still can't get that directory listing on your
A: drive, here's a hint: man mount.</p></div></div>
