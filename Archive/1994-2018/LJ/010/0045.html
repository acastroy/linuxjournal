    &gt;First-time Linux representation, interesting application
    demonstrations, a
    vast array of materials and excited users&mdash;all contributed to a
    productive
    Comdex show.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e26580.0x1f1e298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Braving the crowds last November, I
joined over 200,000 participants at COMDEX in Las Vegas, Nevada.
The largest computer trade show in the world, COMDEX offered 2,200
exhibitors plying their new computer, multimedia and/or
communication products at numerous convention sites and on multiple
convention floors.
</p><p>As if that wasn't enough, a PowerPC Pavilion brought together
dozens of other exhibitors running their applications on PowerPC
systems.</p><p>Surprisingly, given the almost overwhelming amount of
information offered, there usually isn't much about Unix at COMDEX.
This year, however, I was very pleased to find Linux represented at
two booths at the show. Both Yggdrasil Computing, Inc., and Morse
Telecommunication had Linux in their companies' banner.</p><p>I spent time at both of these booths to see first-hand the
responses people had to Linux. The two most evident responses were
easily categorized into the skeptics and the fanatics. The fanatics
obviously knew about&mdash;and used&mdash;Linux. The skeptics were usually
those who had barely tried Unix and didn't like it&mdash;but even so,
they had trouble believing it could be free. I saw a few skeptics
walk away with information about Linux products.</p><p>Dan Quinlan, Adam Richter and Corrine Butleau staffed the
Yggdrasil Computing Booth at the Sands Expo and Convention Center.
They demonstrated various applications on Linux, including the
Microsoft Windows Solitaire game running under WINE (the Windows
Emulator for Linux). They also had the company's latest version of
The Linux Bible, The GNU Testament, available for perusal and were
also giving away copies of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>Adam said that he thought the most important news that week
was that Linux was moving to ELF (Executable Loadable Format) as
the binary format. ELF is the standard format used by most PC Unix
implementations, such as SVR4. Yggdrasil's Winter, 1995, release of
Plug &amp; Play, which will be available by the time you read this,
will have ELF binaries.</p><p>ACC Bookstore and Morse Telecommunication shared a booth,
staffed by Michael Johnston, Robert Young and Pat Volkerding. Pat,
who was interviewed in <i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue #2, created the
Slackware distribution which is being sold by many vendors. Morse
Telecommunication produces Slackware Professional, a Linux package
sold in many retail outlets.</p><p>ACC Bookstore and Morse had many products and publications
about Linux displayed on their table and shelves, including a
system demonstrating Abacus Software's MacEmulator for Linux, which
had just been announced three days before COMDEX opened.</p><p>They also had flyers from other Linux vendors such as WorkGroup Solutions. Mark Bolzern of WorkGroup Solutions
was often seen at ACC and Morse's booth as well. WorkGroup
Solutions distributes Flagship, which was written by a German
company, multisoft GmBH.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0045f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Flagship is a compiler that compiles XBase code; it's similar
to the MS-DOS product Clipper, but it runs on Linux. This means
that you can port MS-DOS XBase applications to Linux.</p><p>Walnut Creek was also at Comdex showing their many CD-ROMs.
When asked about how well Linux CD-ROMs were selling, one
representative said, &ldquo;Well, COMDEX is like being invaded by the
Huns.&rdquo; I think that meant Linux was not their best-selling product
at the convention.</p><p>Andrew Grove, President and CEO of Intel Corporation, was one
of the keynote speakers. Mr. Grove started with a score card of
hits and misses based upon his speech and predictions at COMDEX
three years ago. He gave himself hits for the rise of the PCI Local
Bus, color notebooks, multimedia, messaging. He gave himself misses
for his predictions on collaborative work with multimedia messaging
and pen-based and wireless notebooks. (However, he wryly noted,
&ldquo;You can still draw a smiley face on a pen-based notebook.&rdquo;)</p><p>Mr. Grove noted he had underestimated the processor
performance vamp&mdash;there has been a 13-fold change in three years in
terms of cost-effectiveness of processors. He also said that when
he last spoke at COMDEX three years before, he had no idea how big
the growth of the home personal computer would be, nor how much
progress would have been made on the Information Highway.</p><p>I wonder what Andrew Grove will say in a few years about the
growth of Linux on personal computers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="0045f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
