    This month's column discusses RCS, the Revision Control
    System.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x25253f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>What is RCS? RCS is the Revision Control
System. Its job is to manage the process of revising and updating
files. It can and should be used for program text and
documentation, as well as for any other files that are revised on a
frequent basis. RCS allows you to retrieve earlier versions of
files, while keeping a log of what changes were made, who made
them, and why. RCS makes it easy to compare any two versions of a
file, and provides a mechanism for merging changes from two
different development &ldquo;branches&rdquo; of a source file.
</p><p>RCS was originally written by Dr. Walter F. Tichy, at Purdue
University. Beginning in 1983, it received wide-spread use in the
Unix community with its release as part of the User Contributed
Software in 4.2BSD. It was described in an article in
&ldquo;Software&mdash;Practice And Experience&rdquo; in July 1985.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x2525558"></a>Why Use RCS?</h2></div></div><p>RCS provides a safety net for the software developer. When
developing, fixing, and improving a program, changes are
inevitable. By saving a stable version of your file in RCS, you can
later return to a known state if a set of changes does not work
out.</p><p>If more than one person is working on the same file, RCS
allows you to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; a file, so that only one person will be
allowed to make changes. Other people can still use the file, e.g.,
for compiling.</p><p>Besides keeping track of what changes were made to a file,
RCS tracks who made the change and when. RCS also files a log
message describing the change. This makes it easy to figure out who
broke the program when the fatal bug is finally isolated.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x2525710"></a>Using RCS</h2></div></div><p>The user interface is intentionally quite simple, consisting
primarily of two commands, <b  >ci</b> and
<b  >co</b>. To start with, make a directory to hold the
program and <b  >cd</b> into it. Then make a directory
named <b  >RCS</b>. Although not required, this is the
cleanest way to do it; all RCS files will be kept in the
<b  >RCS</b> subdirectory. We'll also create the first
version of the program.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir hello
$ cd hello
$ mkdir RCS
$ cat &gt; hello.c # editors are for wimps! :-)
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void)
{
   printf("hello, world\n");
}
^D
$ ls -l hello.c
-rw-r--r--  1 arnold       66 Nov  5 22:33 hello.c
</pre><p>We now have a C source file that is ready to go. When
compiled and run, it prints the well-known, friendly greeting
beloved by C programmers the world over.</p><p>After making sure it compiles, the first thing to do is
&ldquo;check in&rdquo; the program with RCS. This is accomplished with
<b  >ci</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ci hello.c
RCS/hello.c,v &lt;-- hello.c

NOTE: This is NOT the log message!
&gt; world famous C program that prints a friendly
message.
&gt; .
initial revision: 1.1
done
$ ls
RCS
</pre><p>The first time a file is checked in, RCS wants a description
of just what the file is. It reminds us that this is not the log
message, thus, something like &ldquo;initial revision&rdquo; would be
inappropriate here. The <b  >&gt;</b> is the prompt for
information. Also note that the original file is removed. RCS has
the file safely stored in the RCS file <b  >hello.c,v</b>
in the RCS directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x2525c90"></a>Checking Files Out</h2></div></div><p>Well, a file that we can't compile isn't of much use, so the
next thing to do is get a copy so that we can actually compile the
program and use it. This is done with <b  >co</b>, which
stands for &ldquo;check out&rdquo;.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ co hello.c
RCS/hello.c,v -&gt; hello.c

$ ls -l hello.c

$ gcc hello.c -O -o hello; ./hello
hello, world
</pre><p>Note that the file is returned to us, but with read-only
permissions. We are thus allowed to use the file, but not change
it. In normal use, for instance, to build a whole source tree to
install software, you would check out the files read-only, compile
the programs, and then remove the source files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x2525ea0"></a>Locking Files</h2></div></div><p>What about when you want to change a file? Programs do
evolve, so how do you get to the next revision? The first thing to
do is to check out the file, but with a lock on the file. The lock
says that you, and only you, are allowed to check in a new revision
of the file. This is necessary if more than one person will be
working with the source file, so that two people don't trash each
other's work.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ co -l hello.c
RCS/hello.c,v -&gt; hello.c

done
$ ls -l hello.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 arnold         66 Nov  5 22:51 hello.c
</pre><p>This checks out the file, and locks it. Note that the
permissions now allow writing to the file. We can edit the file,
and make our changes to it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

   }
   printf("hello, world\n");
   exit(0);
}
$ gcc -O hello.c -o hello
$ ./hello -advice
Don't Panic!
$ ./hello

</pre><p>Our program now has a new option, <b  >-advice</b>,
that prints a friendly piece of advice and exits with a well known,
special value. The default behavior remains unchanged, except that
<b  >exit</b> is now used for the normal case, as
well.</p><p>We can now check in the new version to RCS. Assuming that we
will want to do further work on the file, <b  >ci</b>
also allows us to use the <b  >-l</b> option. With this
option, <b  >ci</b> will perform the check-in and
automatically do a <b  >co -l</b> for us, so that we can
continue to work on the file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>Here we see where the log message is entered. Log messages
should be relatively brief, describing what was changed and why. In
a commercial environment, you might enter the bug number associated
with a particular fix into the log, as well. We also see that the
file is still available for further editing (permissions
<b  >-rw-r--r--</b>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x2526478"></a>Comparing Versions of a File</h2></div></div><p>You can compare any two versions of a file using the
<b  >rcsdiff</b> command. This command accepts all the
options that the regular <b  >diff</b> command does.
However, it usurps the <b  >-r</b> option for providing
revision numbers. By default, rcsdiff compares the current version
of the working file with the most recently checked-in version. With
one <b  >-r</b> option, it compares the current file
against the specified previous version. You can supply two
instances of the <b  >-r</b> option to make it compare
two different revisions, neither of which is the current version.
Here's an example of the default (and most common) case:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rcsdiff -c hello.c
==================================================
RCS file: RCS/hello.c,v
retrieving revision 1.1
diff -c -r1.1 hello.c
*** 1.1 1994/11/06 03:36:45
--- hello.c     1994/11/06 03:54:49
***************
*** 1,6 ****
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
!  int main(void)
   {
        printf("hello, world\n");
--- 1,12 ----
   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
+  #include &lt;string.h&gt;
!  int main(int argc, char **argv)
   {
+       if (argc &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; strcmp(argv[1], "-advice") == 0) {
+           printf("Don't Panic!\n");
+           exit(42);
+       }
        printf("hello, world\n");
+       exit(0);
   }
</pre><p>This generates a &ldquo;context diff&rdquo;, showing the surrounding
context of what was changed, not just the changes themselves. The
lines marked with ! indicate a changed line from the old to the new
version, and the lines marked with + indicate lines that were
added.</p><p>The <b  >rcsdiff</b> program makes it easy to
generate updates that can be applied with <b  >patch</b>.
When a program is finished, simply check in all the files that make
it up with a new, higher level revision number, such as 3.0. Then,
for the next release, run rcsdiff against revision 3.0 for all
files.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rcsdiff -c -r3.0 RCS/* &gt; myprog-3.0-4.0.patch 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>(This doesn't catch the case of brand new files added in 4.0,
or deleted files that were in 3.0, but you get the idea.)</p><p>As a side note, in order to build and install the RCS
software, you need to have the GNU version of
<b  >diff</b>. Linux systems have this already. If you
don't have GNU diff, you should get it anyway, since it is very
full- featured and noticeably faster than the standard Unix version
of <b  >diff</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x2526aa8"></a>Automatically Tracking Interesting
Information</h2></div></div><p>It is often useful to be able to look at the contents of a
source file and tell what version of the file it is. RCS allows you
to do this by performing &ldquo;keyword substitutions&rdquo; on the contents of
your file when it is checked out. There are a large number of these
keywords; the co man page documents them in full. The most common
ones are <b  >$Id$</b> and
<b  >$Log$</b>.</p><p>The <b  >$Id$</b> keyword is replaced with text
describing the filename, revision, date and time of checkout, the
author, and the state (e.g., <b  >Exp</b>, for
experimental). Usually, this is embedded in a C string constant so
that a binary, generated from the file, can be identified with the
<b  >ident</b> command.</p><p>The <b  >$Log$</b> keyword is replaced with the
text of the most recent log message. This is usually placed inside
a comment, so that the source file is self-documenting, showing
what was changed and when. This is useful, but should be used with
caution: if a file is changed frequently, this log can grow quite a
lot.</p><p>We'll now add the keywords and show the state of the file,
both before and after checking in the changed version.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>We see that RCS has filled in the information for both
keywords. When the program is compiled, the ident command will give
us information about all the files used to compile the program that

<b  >ci</b>, <b  >co</b>, and
<b  >rcsdiff</b>. There are a few other commands that
come with RCS that are also of interest.</p><p>The <b  >rcs</b> command is used for changing the
state of RCS files. In particular, it can be used to lock a file
that is not locked or to break someone else's lock on an RCS file.
This latter operation is perilous and should only be done in an
emergency. There are a number of other operations that rcs can
perform; see the man page for details.</p><p>It is possible to have &ldquo;branches&rdquo; off the main line (or
&ldquo;trunk&rdquo;) of development. For instance, assume that the released
version of hello.c is 2.6 and that version 2.7 will be the next
released version. Programmer Mary is writing version 2.7, while
programmer Joe has to maintain version 2.6. Normally, Joe would
start a separate branch off the main development trunk, generating
versions 2.6.1.1, 2.6.1.2, and so on. RCS can maintain an arbitrary
number of branches off the main trunk, as well as branches off the
branches. However, as you might imagine, keeping track of many
levels of branching can become confusing.</p><p>At some point, Mary will want to make sure that all of Joe's
fixes are incorporated into her version of hello.c; she would do
this using <b  >rcsmerge</b>.
(<b  >rcsmerge</b> uses a separate program that also
comes with RCS, named merge, which does the actual work of merging
the files.)</p><p>Finally, the <b  >rlog</b> command will print out
all the log messages for a particular source file. This allows you
to see the complete change history of a file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Initial revision
 ====================================================
</pre><p>Most of the initial stuff that rlog prints out is explained
in the RCS man pages. Of interest to us are the description and log
message parts of the output, which tell us what the program is,
what changes were made, by whom, and when. Interestingly, the
timestamps are in UTC, not local time. This is so that developers
in different time zones can collaborate without getting
discrepancies in their Id strings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x251dde0"></a>Problems RCS Does Not Solve</h2></div></div><p>The main problem that RCS does not solve is having multiple
people working on a file at the same time and the larger issues of
release management, i.e., making sure that the release is complete
and up to date.</p><p>A separate software suite is available for this purpose:
<b  >cvs</b>, the Concurrent Version System. From the
README file in the <b  >cvs</b> distribution:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><b  >cvs</b> is a front end to the
<b  >rcs</b>(1) revision control system which extends the
notion of revision control from a collection of files in a single
directory to a hierarchical collection of directories consisting of
revision-controlled files. These directories and files can be
combined together to form a software release. cvs provides the
functions necessary to manage these software releases and to
control the concurrent editing of source files among multiple
software developers.</p></blockquote></div><p>You can get <b  >cvs</b> from ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu in
/pub/gnu. At the time of this writing, the current version is
cvs-1.3.tar.gz. By the time you read this, CVS 1.4 may be out, so
look for cvs-1.4.tar.gz, and retrieve that version if it is
there.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x242d580.0x251e200"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>RCS provides complete, flexible revision control in an
