    A remarkable conference with developers, support persons and
    resellers results in a successful, information-packed event.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bad580.0x1ca52f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Open Systems World/FedUNIX'94 in
Washington DC, in its sixth year, included several conferences and
classes such as the FedUnix Sessions, Motif/COSE Users Conference,
Novell AppWare Developers, SCO, Solaris, Windows NT, and World Wide
Web/Mosaic conferences. For the first time, on December 1 and 2,
Open Systems World offered a Linux International Users and
Developers Conference and a one-day Linux Tutorial.
</p><p>The suggestion to include a Linux conference at Open Systems
World was made by Thomas Sterling, the Acting Director of CESDIS
(Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences). Alan
Fedder, the director of Open Systems World, made the choice to
bring Linux to Open Systems World/FedUNIX'94.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> developed and sponsored the Linux conference
with immeasurable help from the speakers and other volunteers. One
article cannot begin to include all the information presented at
the sessions and the tutorial; future articles will include a more
in-depth and technical report about each session.</p><p>Approximately 50 people signed up for the conference and the
tutorial, but there were 67 people, including speakers, present
during the one-day conference. Included in the conference were
several panel discussions interlaced with presentations from
experts on particular subjects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bad580.0x1ca5558"></a>Panel: What Should the Relationship Be Between
Linux Resellers and the Linux Development Community?</h2></div></div><p>Robert Young of ACC Bookstore moderated four panel members:
Eric Youngdale and Donald Becker representing developers and Dan
Irvin of Linux Systems Laboratories and Mark Horton, a support
person for InfoMagic, representing resellers.</p><p><a href="0048f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Eric
Youngdale</b></span></a></p><p><a href="0048f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Audience during
panel discussion.</b></span></a></p><p>The opinions of all the panelists seemed to be that a
cooperative relationship existed, and would continue to exist,
between developers and resellers. There was mild dissension about
Linux support when the moderator commented that the user couldn't
get, or shouldn't expect to get, Linux support for the low price of
a Linux distribution on CD; this was disputed by Mark Horton,
support person for InfoMagic, who replied that the InfoMagic CD-ROM
included support, and discussed the kind of support they were
giving. Horton added that, in general, the support wasn't getting
abused/overused by the end user.</p><p>There was a feeling of good will between developers and
resellers. This was definitely a panel discussion, not a panel
argument.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bad580.0x1ca5920"></a>Panel: The Commercial Future of Linux</h2></div></div><p>Moderated by Michael K. Johnson, the four panelists included
Marc Ewing of Red Hat Software, Mark Komarinski who writes the
&ldquo;System Administration&rdquo; column for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Ross Biro of
Yggdrasil Computing and Mark Bolzern of WorkGroup Solutions.</p><p><a href="0048f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Mark Horton,
Mark Komarinski and Phil Hughes</b></span></a></p><p>They discussed the current commercial products available for
Linux, obstacles to the development of commercial products, and how
commercial vendors might be persuaded to port their product to
Linux and market it.</p><p>There are already about 50 commercial applications available
for Linux, including Tecplot, ISE Eiffel, Genplot, dBMan, ESQLFLEX
and JustLogic Database Manager. Although Linux users expect
relatively inexpensive applications, it's not profitable for
commercial marketers to produce such low-cost applications due to
development and marketing costs. Distribution channels can be a
significant cost factor in inexpensive applications, as well as the
cost of advertising, which can, for example, run $3,500 for a
one-time quarter page ad in a popular Unix magazine.</p><p>Mark Bolzern said that while Linux is becoming &ldquo;the Unix of
choice&rdquo;, Linux is not yet trusted to be mission-critical. Bolzern
anticipates, however, that over the next year, Linux will be used
in this capacity, such as the application currently in use at
Virginia Power for real-time data collection.</p><p>Ross Biro stressed the importance of hardware in the
commercial future of Linux. Except for Cyclades who makes serial
boards, there aren't enough hardware vendors making their products'
specifications available for Linux developers. There was general
agreement among audience members, the panel and the moderator about
the need for more hardware support for Linux. (However, it's
rumored that half of Cyclades' domestic sales of one of their
serial boards is to Linux users.) Mark Komarinski noted that having
most of the kernel written in C (as it is now) will help with
porting to hardware.</p><p>Some panelists and audience members added positive comments
about the two ports for the DEC alpha chip in progress: one being
done by DEC, the other by Linus Torvalds on a machine loaned to him
by DEC.</p><p>Mark Bolzern talked about how his company was investing in
its Linux application now and pricing it far below the actual price
the development and marketing costs would allow for such a product,
because they anticipate that the future volume of sales to the
Linux market will make this worth their investment.</p><p>Bolzern advised that his company is paying a PR firm to
promote Linux, with the idea that increased sales of their product
will follow as Flagship demos become available on many more of the
different Linux distributions on CD-ROM. To help with the PR work,
he asked for success stories, such as how Linux users replaced
their whole network with Linux systems, or did something with Linux
that could not be done any other way. Please e-mail to

is the principal investigator on a new project at NASA called
Beowulf, a cluster of Linux processors, connected by parallel
Ethernets. He discussed the project with an enthralled
audience.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bad580.0x1ca6058"></a>Other Topics</h2></div></div><p>After lunch, participants returned for an inspiring talk on
How To Convince Your Boss/Employer/Customer To Use Linux. Dr. Greg
Wettstein from the Roger Maris Cancer Center (see Issue #5 of <i  >Linux Journal</i> for his article about their Linux system) discussed a
planned, reasonable way to present Linux to someone as a solution.
He noted you should identify a specific problem that Linux can fix,
explain how Linux can fix it, emphasize Linux advantages (for
example, having source code available so you can make changes, its
built-in networking and its support community). Don't try to
replace an entire working system with Linux in one fell swoop&mdash;he
emphasized, &ldquo;Evolution, Not Revolution&rdquo;.</p><p>Other subjects in the conference were: WINE presented by Bob
Amstadt, Linux and The X Windows System presented by Przemek
Klosowski and Linux and iBCS2 Compatibility by Eric Youngdale.
iBCS2 defines a common object program format&mdash;a standard for PC
Unix executables. The iBCS2 compatibility libraries will allow
existing PC Unix applications to run on a Linux platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bad580.0x1ca6210"></a>Panel: Commercial Use of Linux</h2></div></div><p>This panel discussion included Vance Petree, who is using
Linux for real-time data collection at Virginia Power; Russell
Carter, Sandia Labs, using Linux for a super workstation; Greg
Wettstein, of the Roger Maris Cancer Center, who uses Linux for a
Patient Information System, written using Perl and Tcl/Tk; Donald
Becker, NASA, who is developing a cluster of Linux stations; Paul
Tomblin formerly of Gandalf, who is using Linux to build test tools
for testing Gandalf's networking products.</p><p>The audience at all the talks was attentive. The one-day
tutorial included experts speaking on their particular area of
expertise and will be covered in other articles. All in all, the
conference felt like a big success with an amazing amount of
information presented.</p><p><a href="0048s1.html" target="_self">Letters about the
