    Last month, we gave an introduction to block device drivers. This month,
    we look at some tricks that are useful when writing block device
    drivers,
    starting with the most basic &ldquo;trick&rdquo; of using hardware interrupts
    where available and describing some neat infrastructure that block
    device drivers can take advantage of by adding five lines of code and
    one function.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21dd450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Block devices, which are usually intended
to hold file-systems, may or may not be interrupt-driven.
Interrupt-driven block device drivers have the potential to be
faster and more efficient than non- interrupt-driven block device
drivers.
</p><p>Last month, I gave an example of a very simplistic block
device driver that reads its request queue one item at a time,
satisfying each request in turn, until the request queue is
emptied, and then returning. Some block device drivers in the
standard kernel are like this. The ramdisk driver is the obvious
example; it does very little more than the simplistic block device
driver I presented. Less obvious to the casual observer, few of the
CD-ROM drivers (actually none of them, as I write this) are
interrupt-driven. It is easy to determine which drivers are
interrupt-driven by reading drivers/block/blk.h, searching for the
string <b  >DEVICE_INTR</b>, and noting which devices use
it.</p><p>I'm tired of typing &ldquo;block device driver&rdquo;, and you are
probably tired of reading it. For the rest of this article, I will
use &ldquo;driver&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;block device driver&rdquo;, except where stated
otherwise.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21dd660"></a>Efficiency Is Speed</h2></div></div><p>Interrupt-driven drivers have the potential to be more
efficient than non-interrupt-driven ones because the drivers have
to spend less time busy-waiting&mdash;sitting in a tight loop, waiting
for the device to become ready or finish executing a command. They
also have the potential to be faster, because it may be possible to
arrange for multiple requests to be satisfied at once, or to take
advantage of peculiarities of the hardware.</p><p>In particular, the SCSI disk driver tries to send the SCSI
disk one command to read multiple sectors and satisfy each of the
requests as the data for each block arrives from the disk. This is
a big win considering the way the SCSI interface is designed;
because initiating a SCSI transfer takes some complex negotiation,
it takes a significant amount of time to negotiate a SCSI transfer,
and when the SCSI driver can ask for multiple blocks at the same
time, it only has to negotiate the transfer once, instead of once
for each block.</p><p>This complex negotiation makes SCSI a robust bus that is
useful for many things besides disk drives. It also makes it
necessary to pay attention to timing when writing the driver, in
order to take advantage of the possibilities without being
extremely slow. Before certain optimizations were added to the
generic, high-level SCSI driver in Linux, SCSI performance did not
at all approach its theoretical peak. Those optimizations made for
throughput 3 to 10 times greater on most devices.</p><p>As another example, the original floppy driver in Linux was
very slow. Each time it wanted a block, it read it in from the
media. The floppy hardware is very slow and has high latency (it
rotates slowly and if you wanted to read the block that just
started going past the head, you had to wait until the disk made a
full revolution), which kept it very slow.</p><p>Around version .12, Lawrence Foard added a track buffer.
Since it only takes approximately 30% to 50% more time to read an
entire track off the floppy as it does to wait for the block you
want to read to come around and be read (depending on the type of
disk and the position of the disk at the start of the request), it
makes sense, when reading a block, to read the entire track the
block is in.</p><p>As soon as the requested block has been read into the track
buffer, it is copied into the request buffer, the process waiting
for it to be read can continue, and the rest of the track is read
into a private buffer area belonging to the floppy driver. The next
request for a block from that floppy is often for the very next
block, and that block is now in the track buffer and ready
immediately to be used to fulfill the request. This is true
approximately 8 times out of 9 (assuming 9 blocks, or 18 sectors,
per track). This single change turned the floppy driver from a very
slow driver into a very fast driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21dd920"></a>Alright! Enough Already!</h2></div></div><p>So, you are convinced that interrupt-driven drivers have a
lot more potential, and you want to know how to turn the
non-interrupt-driven driver you wrote last month into an
interrupt-driven one. I can't give you all the information you need
in a single article, but I can get you started, and after reading
the rest of this article, you will be better prepared to read the
source code for real drivers, which is the best preparation for
writing your own driver.</p><p>The basic control flow of a request for a block from a
non-interrupt-driven driver usually runs something like this
<span   class="bold"><b>simplification alert</b></span>:</p><p>user program calls <b  >read()</b>
<b  >read()</b> (in the kernel) asks the buffer cache to
get and fill in the block buffer cache notices that it doesn't have
the data in the cache buffer cache asks driver to fill in a block
with correct data driver satisfies request and returns buffer cache
passes newly-filled-in block back to <b  >read()</b>
<b  >read()</b> copies the data into the user program and
returns user program continues An interrupt-driven driver runs more
like this <span   class="bold"><b>simplification alert</b></span>:
user program calls <b  >read()</b>
<b  >read()</b> (in the kernel) asks the buffer cache to
get and fill in the block buffer cache notices that it doesn't have
the data in the cache buffer cache asks driver to fill in a block
with correct data driver starts the process of satisfying the
request and returns buffer cache waits for block to be read by
sleeping on an event Some other processes run for a while, perhaps
causing other I/O on the device. the physical device has the data
available and interrupts the driver driver reads the data from the
device and wakes up the buffer cache buffer cache passes the
newly-filled-in block back to <b  >read()</b>.
<b  >read()</b> copies the data into the user program and
returns user program continues</p><p>Note that <b  >read()</b> is not the only way to
initiate I/O.</p><p>One thing to note about this is that just about anything can
be done before waking up the process(es) waiting for the request to
complete. In fact, other requests might be added to the queue. This
seems, at first, like a troublesome complication, but really is one
of the important things that makes it possible to do some
worthwhile optimizations. This will become obvious as we start to
optimize the driver. We will start, though, by taking our
non-interrupt-driven driver and making it use interrupts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21ddf50"></a>Interrupts</h2></div></div><p>I am going to take the <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> driver I
started developing last month, and add interrupt service to it. It
is hard to write good, detailed code for a hypothetical and vaguely
defined device, so (as usual) if you want to understand better
after reading this, take a look at some real devices. I suggest the
hd and floppy devices; start from the
<b  >do_hd_request()</b> and
<b  >do_fd_request()</b> routines and follow the logic
through.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void do_foo_request(void) {
  if (foo_busy)
    /* another request is being processed;
       this one will automatically follow */
    return;
    foo_busy = 1;
    foo_initialize_io();
}
static void foo_initialize_io(void) {

</pre><p>In blk.h, we need to add a few lines to the FOO_MAJOR
section:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#elif (MAJOR_NR == FOO_MAJOR)
#define DEVICE_NAME "foobar"
#define DEVICE_REQUEST do_foo_request
#define DEVICE_INTR do_foo
#define DEVICE_NR(device) (MINOR(device) &gt; 6)
#define DEVICE_ON(device)
#define DEVICE_OFF(device)
#endif
</pre><p>Note that many functions are missing from this; this is the
important part to understanding interrupt-driven device drivers;
the &ldquo;heart&rdquo;, if you will. Also note that, obviously, I haven't
tried to compile or run this hypothetical driver. I may have made
some mistakes&mdash;you are bound to make mistakes of your own while
writing your driver, and finding bugs in this skeleton will be good
practice for finding bugs in your own driver, if you are so
inclined. I do suggest that when you write your own driver, you
start with code from some other working driver rather than starting
from this skeleton code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21de2c0"></a>Structure</h2></div></div><p>An explanation of some of the new ideas here is in order. The
first new idea is (obviously, I hope) the use of interrupt routines
to do part of servicing the hardware and walking down the request
list. I used separate routines for reading and writing; this isn't
fundamentally necessary, but it does generally help allow cleaner
code and smaller, easier-to-read interrupt service routines. Most
(all?) of the interrupt-driven device drivers of any kind in the
real kernel use separate routines for reading and writing.</p><p>We also have a separate routine to do most of the I/O setup
instead of doing it in the request() procedure. This is so that the
interrupt routines can call the separate routings to set up the
next request, if necessary, upon completion of a request. Again,
this is a design feature that makes most real-world drivers smaller
and easier to write and debug.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21de420"></a>Context</h2></div></div><p>It must be noted that any routine that is called from an
interrupt is different than all the other routines I have described
so far. Routines called from an interrupt do not execute in the
context of any calling user-level program and cannot write to
user-level memory. They can only write to kernel memory. If they
absolutely need to allocate memory, they must do so with the
<b  >GFP_ATOMIC</b> priority. In general, it is best for
them to write into buffers allocated from user-process-context
routines with priority <b  >GFP_KERNEL</b> before the
interrupt routines are set up. They also can wake up processes
sleeping on an event, as <b  >end_request()</b> does, but
they cannot sleep themselves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21de630"></a>Macros</h2></div></div><p>The header file blk.h provides some nice macros which are
used here. I won't document them all (most are documented in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide</em></span>, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>KHG</em></span>), but I will mention the ones I use, which
are used to manage interrupts.</p><p>Instead of setting up interrupts manually, it is easier and
better to use the <b  >SET_INTR()</b> macro. (If you want
to know how to set them up manually, read the definitions of
<b  >SET_INTR</b> in blk.h.) Easier because you just do
<b  >SET_INTR(interrupt_handling_function)</b>, and
better because if you set up automatic timeouts (which we will
cover later), <b  >SET_INTR()</b> automatically sets them
up.</p><p>Then, when the interrupt has been serviced, the interrupt
service routine (<b  >foo_read_intr()</b> or
<b  >foo_write_intr()</b> above) clears the interrupt, so
that spurious interrupts don't get delivered to a procedure that
thinks that it is supposed to read or write to the current request.
It is possible&mdash;it only takes a little more work&mdash;to provide an
interrupt routing to handle spurious interrupts. If you are
interested, read the <b  >hd</b> driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21deb00"></a>Automatic Timeouts</h2></div></div><p>In blk.h, a mechanism for timing out when hardware doesn't
respond is provided. If the <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span> device has not
responded to a request after 5 seconds have passed, there is very
clearly something wrong. We will update blk.h again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#elif (MAJOR_NR == FOO_MAJOR)
#define DEVICE_NAME "foobar"
#define DEVICE_REQUEST do_foo_request
#define DEVICE_INTR do_foo
#define DEVICE_TIMEOUT FOO_TIMER
#define TIMEOUT_VALUE 500
/* 500 == 5 seconds */
#define DEVICE_NR(device) (MINOR(device) &gt; 6)
#define DEVICE_ON(device)
#define DEVICE_OFF(device)
#endif
</pre><p>This is where using <b  >SET_INTR()</b> and
<b  >CLEAR_INTR</b> becomes helpful. Simply by defining
<b  >DEVICE_TIMEOUT</b>, <b  >SET_INTR</b> is
changed to automatically set a &ldquo;watchdog timer&rdquo; that goes off if
the foo device has not responded after 5 seconds,
<b  >SET_TIMER</b> is provided to set the watchdog timer
manually, and a <b  >CLEAR_TIMER</b> macro is provided to
turn off the watchdog timer. The only three other things that need
to be done are to:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Add a timer, <b  >FOO_TIMER</b>, to
<b  >linux/timer.h</b>. This must be a
<b  >#define</b>'d value that is not already used and
must be less than 32 (there are only 32 static timers).</p></li><li><p>In the <b  >foo_init()</b> function
called at boot time to detect and initialize the hardware, a line
must be added:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
timer_table[FOO_TIMER].fn = foo_times_out;
</pre></li><li><p>And (as you may have guessed from step 2) a
function <b  >foo_times_out()</b> must be written to try
restarting requests, or otherwise handling the time out
condition.</p></li></ol></div><p>The <b  >foo_times_out()</b> function should
probably reset the device, try to restart the request if
appropriate, and should use the
<b  >CURRENT-&gt;errors</b> variable to keep track of how
many errors have occurred on that request. It should also check to
see if too many errors have occurred, and if so, call
<b  >end_request(0)</b> and go on to the next
request.</p><p>Exactly what steps are required depend on how the hardware
device behaves, but both the hd and the floppy drivers provide this
functionality, and by comparing and contrasting them, you should be
able to determine how to write such a function for your device.
Here is a sample, loosely based on the
<b  >hd_times_out()</b> function in hd.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void hd_times_out(void)
{
   unsigned int dev;
   SET_INTR(NULL);
   if (!CURRENT)
      /* completely spurious interrupt-
         pretend it didn't happen. */
      return;
   dev = DEVICE_NR(CURRENT-&gt;dev);
#ifdef DEBUG
   printk("foo%c: timeout\n", dev+'a');
#endif
   if (++CURRENT-&gt;errors &gt;= FOO_MAX_ERRORS) {
#ifdef DEBUG
      printk("foo%c: too many errors\n", dev+'a');
#endif
      /* Tell buffer cache: couldn't fulfill request */
      end_request(0);
      INIT_REQUEST;
   }
   /* Now try the request again */
   foo_initialize_io();
}
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>SET_INTR(NULL)</em></span> keeps this function from
being called recursively. The next two lines ignore interrupts that
occur when no requests have been issued. Then we check for
excessive errors, and if there have been too many errors on this
request, we abort it and go on to the next request, if any; if
there are no requests, we return. (Remember that the
<b  >INIT_REQUEST</b> macro causes a return if there are
no requests left.)</p><p>At the end, we are either retrying the current request or
have given up and gone on to the next request, and in either case,
we need to re-start the request.</p><p>We could reset the foo device right before calling
<b  >foo_initialize_io()</b>, if the device maintains
some state and needs a reset. Again, this depends on the details of
the device for which you are writing the driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e5580.0x21d60a0"></a>Stay Tuned...</h2></div></div><p>Next month, we will discuss optimizing block device
