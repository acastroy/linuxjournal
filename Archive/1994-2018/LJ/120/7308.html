They said he was crazy when he asked about device driver support.

With this issue, <i  >Linux Journal</i> turns ten. I hadn't really thought about
how <i  >LJ</i> had been my job for ten years until Don suggested I write this
editorial. To me, that's a good thing; I have been publishing
rather than counting days. What has happened in these
last ten years is amazing. Ten years ago I don't think anyone would have expected to
see the L-word in ads by HP, IBM, Oracle and many other big players.
</p><p>
In looking around to see what I had from ten years ago that might have
something to do with this editorial, I found two interesting things. The
first was my copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Yggdrasil LGX: Linux/GNU/X</em></span>. This is the Fall
1993 distribution. The second was a picture of Phaedra, the daughter of
Joanne Wagner, our first ad rep. The two go together because Phaedra
(now 15) used to play the text game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mille Bornes</em></span>, from the BSD games
collection, on this version of Linux.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7308f1.large.jpg"><img src="7308f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Who came up with the name?
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7308f2.large.jpg"><img src="7308f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Is she still a Linux gamer?
</p></div></div><p>
The distribution came in the form of a 64-page book and had a description of what
it included and what it would run on on the covers. Inside you found a
CD, a regular 5 1/4" boot floppy and one of those new-fangled 3.5" boot
floppies. The system requirements were 4MB of RAM and from 2 to 680MB of
disk space. Inside the book were installation information and a list of
where to get support&mdash;12 places. One of these 12 is Russ
Nelson at Crynwr Software, who still is very much an active member of
what we were all calling the free software community back then.
</p><p>
We publish a magazine, so let me look at what I predicted back in the beginning.
My editorial in issue two was a
piece of fiction describing what Linux would be like in the year
2000&mdash;six years into the future. The first sentence says, &ldquo;In the
past 7 years we have seen Linux go from an idea for a small UNIX-like
system into a movement to bring affordable, reliable multi-tasking
software to anyone who could buy a rather minimal computer.&rdquo; I don't
think there is any argument there.
</p><p>
After some rambling about a program loader called MS-DOS, I went on to
say, &ldquo;With the advent of ISDN in the early 1990s and personal satellite
stations in the late 1990s, connectivity became the big issue.&rdquo; Personal
satellite certainly did happen. I was wrong about ISDN (I guess I forgot
it stands for It Still Does Nothing), but DSL and cable clearly filled
that gap. So, I am still on track.
</p><p>
And that's where the track went astray. For example, I predicted that
90% of <i  >LJ</i> subscribers would be receiving the magazine on-line. It
still sounds like a great goal, but a combination of people wanting to
have something to carry on the bus with them and the way subscription
audits work&mdash;that is, only paper magazines count toward the official
circulation&mdash;has slowed progress
there. Of course, to my credit, Microsoft founder Bill Gates previously had predicted that
Xenix on an Intel 80286 chip was the future of computing, so at least I
was a little closer.
</p><p>
All my other predictions had to do with getting everyone on
the Internet. In January 2001, I moved to Costa Rica. In the 1994
editorial I claimed that in 2000, I was in Yaak, Montana. So, I did
move but I picked a place with a lot better weather. This move also helped
me adjust my perspective about Internet connectivity. While many
countries, Korea being a good example, are delivering broadband
Internet service to a large percentage of their population, many
other places are still without.
</p><p>
About nine years ago we decided
we needed a Web presence. Linux and Apache sounded like the right
approach, so we set up a 486DX100 with 16MB of RAM to test the waters.
We agreed to evaluate what we really wanted to do when we got to
10,000 hits per month. <i  >LJ</i> was growing and we were busy with other projects.
When we finally looked at the Web site again we were at 100,000 hits per month.
The system was handling it just fine. Today, we receive over 10,000
hits per hour on our Web sites.
</p><p>
Early on in the life of Linux, ISPs considered it to be an
alternative to proprietary UNIX platforms. This was an era where dial-up
was almost always the answer. Unfortunately, no intelligent
serial communications boards were available with Linux drivers. I started
talking to vendors and they all thought I was crazy to think there was
any commercial future in Linux for them.
</p><p>
One company kept talking to me, though. They thought I was crazy mind you, but they
did keep talking. That company was Cyclades, and I finally managed to get
them to give Randy Bentson one of their boards so he could write a Linux
driver. Six months later, Doris Li, their marketing manager, admitted
that 50% of their domestic sales of that board were going to Linux
users. Much like Russ Nelson, Cyclades is still here.

What We Did Right (and Wrong)</h2></div></div><p>
When Irene Pasternack and I started SSC about 20 years ago, we knew
we would be doing computer-related documentation and training, but we needed
to focus better than that. After discussing this, we decided the
important thing that would make us different from everyone else was
we would create only products we wanted for ourselves.
</p><p>
We weren't perfect, and every now and then we would get a brilliant idea
and forget to check it against this criteria. For example, we did
three MS-DOS Reference Cards. Bottom line: we sold about 5,000 of them,
while we sold more like 500,000 vi Reference Cards.
</p><p>
Starting <i  >LJ</i> was one of those things we wanted for ourselves. We had
been running UNIX, but it looked like Linux was what we needed.
We started the magazine and made the switch pretty
much at the same time and have never looked back. We still do layout
using Quark XPress on a non-Linux system, but Scribus is looking
pretty good now, so we could be an all-Linux shop in the near future.
</p><p>
Once we started doing <i  >LJ</i>, things have fallen into place a lot
better than ever before. Here are a few of those magic happenings:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
I knew Doc Searls' wife before they were married, in fact,
before he knew her. Doc became part of <i  >LJ</i> because Joyce convinced him
that I seemed to be on to something.
</p></li><li><p>
Right after Doc wrote the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span>, he got
e-mail from Dawn Smith. She told him she really liked the book and if he
was ever in Costa Rica....He wrote back telling her that his publisher
at <i  >LJ</i> had just been to Costa Rica. Dawn told him that her husband
recently had been working with Linux. Today, Willy Smith, Dawn's husband,
works for us.
</p></li><li><p>
Back when I was starting SSC I worked for a company that did point-of-sale
systems for gas stations. That's where I met Dan Wilder, who has
been our head geek for the last few years.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I could go on and on here, but the important point I am trying to make is
that with <i  >LJ</i>, connections have just happened. Or, more accurately, when
we let things happen in the Linux racket we seem to get the desired
results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16be580.0x17b7420"></a>
Building a Community</h2></div></div><p>
Linux made me believe in community. I have worked in computers
since 1968 and had a few other technical jobs when I was going to
college. They were just that, jobs. I worked for a company that produced
something it wanted to sell. You always had &ldquo;the company&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the
customer&rdquo;. With Linux, that paradigm changed.
</p><p>
At first there was no company. The latest Linux distribution was a box
of home-brew floppies that were passed around at the Seattle Linux
Users' Group meetings. We knew Linux was growing fast when we had two
sets to loan out. I remember sending e-mail to Ted Ts'o about a problem
I was having with the serial driver. I was somewhat timid, but his
response included a new driver to test. It fixed the bug, and I realized
that Linux was moving forward because we worked together.
</p><p>
The first time I met Linus Torvalds I saw what was behind that whole sense of
community. It was at a party in Washington, DC. When Michael K. Johnson
and I arrived, Linus
was there along with a few other people who had contributed code to
Linux. They were in a technical discussion about how something new
should be implemented. What I saw was Linus treating these people as
peers rather than trying to be the boss. To me, Linus is the ultimate
manager. I mean, who else has been able to get thousands of employees,
many of whom he has never even met, to work for free?
</p><p>
With Linux and <i  >Linux Journal</i>, that community continued. We have authors
who write because they want to write, readers who tell us that our
ads are very useful to them and advertisers who ask us what we think
our readers want to see. Sure, there is money changing hands (I haven't
yet figured out how to get my staff to work for free), but much of that
money is recycled within the Linux community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16be580.0x17b7738"></a>
World Domination</h2></div></div><p>
Linus coined the idea of World Domination after we had started <i  >Linux Journal</i>. At first it sounded like a joke, but today, it sounds like a goal
we will reach before <i  >LJ</i> turns 20. But, again, looking at the world
scene we see a much different picture than if we solely focus on the United
States.
</p><p>
Initially, I thought it was a third-world issue that drove Linux
penetration. That is, people here don't have the same amount of
disposable income as those in the US, and therefore, they are more
willing to listen to a solution than follow the marketing hype.
But, Linux penetration in Europe is very significant; the same is true
in Asia. Although I don't understand why, I think the United States
will be the last country to take Linux seriously.
</p><p>
There are two ways we can move Linux forward in the marketplace. One is
to continue to show the shortcomings of proprietary alternatives. The
problem with this approach is you get into a &ldquo;which is
better&rdquo;
contest, and the people on the anti-Linux side have a lot more money than
we do. Thus, it isn't an issue of being right but of getting everyone
else to see you are right.
</p><p>
The other method is to just do it. That is, run Linux. Help others run
Linux. When a business needs a solution, offer Linux. And, most
important of all, when Linux doesn't do something that is needed,
address it. We have an amazing base available and some amazing talent in
the Linux community. It is time to run with what we have and reach that
World Domination goal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16be580.0x17b7a50"></a>
What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>
First, I have some questions that need answers. Actually, we
probably will never get the answers, but I find them interesting to think
about:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
At what point did Microsoft spend more on bad-mouthing Linux than all
Linux vendors combined spend on marketing?
</p></li><li><p>
When will the number of installed copies of Linux exceed
the number of legally installed copies of Microsoft OSes?
</p></li><li><p>
When will the number of installed copies of Linux exceed the number of
total installed copies of Microsoft OSes?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Notice that I say when, not if. This will happen. It may happen last in
the United States, but the combination of Linux maturing and the world
economy dictates that this will happen. All of us have an opportunity to
make this happen faster.
</p><p>
By the time you read this, I probably will be in Nicaragua helping get
some Linux classes started. These are not classes for systems
administrators or even computer users. The average person will have
never used a computer before and currently makes about $3/day working
in a cigar factory. This is not the profile of people that Microsoft
is interested in marketing to, but they are typical future new computer
users.
This is my current path;
you don't have to pick this same path. You simply can use Linux and set an
example.
</p><p>
Another good approach is to help someone convert to Linux.
For example, my neighbor does computer consulting. All his customers run
Microsoft software, but they are getting pretty irritated by worms and
viruses. Most of them run typical office software, including word processor,
spreadsheet and e-mail, so it is the perfect time to offer them an
alternative.
</p><p>
Although Linux certainly has become mainstream, it still has a great
distance to go before we can claim a World
Domination success story. If you are a <i  >Linux Journal</i> reader, you are likely ahead of the crowd. Put a little effort
into getting that crowd moving in the right direction, and we can reach
World Domination long before <i  >Linux Journal</i> is 20.
</p><p>
Looking beyond Linux, we also need to look at how what has happened with
Linux is a template for what can happen in other areas.
In mid-2003, we started our WorldWatch site as an experiment (<a href="http://worldwatch.linuxgazette.com" target="_self">worldwatch.linuxgazette.com</a>). We saw the need for a worldview of what was happening
with Linux and open-source software from a social, political and
economic point of view. What happened made WorldWatch Editor Willy Smith
realize that we needed to tie together free, libre and open-source
software (FLOSS) with similar
efforts in other areas. One of the best examples is what we called
Open Source seeds. That is, seeds that actually can reproduce
rather than the genetically engineered ones that have to be
purchased from the patent holder.
</p><p>
This revelation resulted in our creation of a new Web site, A42 (<a href="http://www.a42.com" target="_self">www.a42.com</a>).
The Linux-related technical side of what WorldWatch was will be
appearing on Linux Gazette (<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.com" target="_self">www.linuxgazette.com</a>).
A42 is going to be where we
try to tie together the whole open-source revolution&mdash;whether it
applies to computers or not. In order to remain sane, A42 will take a
light-hearted approach.
</p><p>
So, let's just say Linux moving toward World Domination is well on the way,
and I feel comfortable enough it will happen that I am going
to go further out on a limb this time and say that Open
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Everything</em></span>
is the real goal. <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>Hasta pronto</i></span>.
