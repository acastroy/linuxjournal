Here are the kernel mechanisms used in DSM to embed
security information into IP messages in a transparent way.

This article is a follow-up to previous articles in <i  >LJ</i> that
discuss the Distributed Security Infrastructure (DSI) and the Linux
Distributed Security Module (DSM) [see &ldquo;Linux Distributed Security
Module&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, October 2002, available at <a href="../102/6215.html" target="_self">/article/6215</a>, and &ldquo;DSI: a New
Architecture for Secure Carrier-Class Linux Clusters&rdquo;, available at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6053" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6053</a>]. In this article, we focus on
how we used IP options in DSM to send security information in a
distributed environment for the process level of security. We
discuss network buffer handling, adding hooks into the kernel, IP
options and modifying IP headers. We then cover the network
hooks in DSM and present some early performance results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da5920"></a>
The DSI Project</h2></div></div><p>
The Open System Lab at Ericsson Research started the Open Source DSI
Project to design and develop a cluster security infrastructure
targeted at soft, real-time telecom applications running on
Linux carrier-grade clusters. These clusters are expected to
operate nonstop, regardless of any hardware or software errors.
They must allow operators to upgrade hardware and software, kernel
and applications, during normal operations, without any scheduled
downtime and without affecting the offered services.
</p><p>
DSI originally was designed to offer carrier-grade characteristics, such as reliability, scalability, high availability and efficient
performance. Furthermore, it supports several other important
features, including a coherent framework, a process-level
approach and support for both preemptive security and dynamic
security policies.
</p><p>
One important feature of DSI is its process-level access
control. Currently implemented security mechanisms are based on user
privileges and do not support authentication checks for interactions
between two processes belonging to the same user, even if the processes
are created on remote processors. For telecom applications,
only a few users run the same application for a long period of time
without any interruption. Applying the above concept grants the same
security privileges to all processes created on different nodes, which
leads to no security checks for many actions through the distributed
system. The granularity of the basic entity for the above security
control is the user. For carrier-class applications, this granularity
is not sufficient, and the need for a more fine-grained basic entity,
the individual process, is required and thus supported in DSI.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da5ad8"></a>
The Distributed Security Module</h2></div></div><p>
The DSM is a core component of DSI that provides the implementation of
mandatory access control within a Linux cluster. The DSM is responsible
for enforcing access control and providing labeling for the IP messages
with the security attributes of the sending process and node across the
nodes of the cluster.
</p><p>
The DSM is implemented as a Linux module using the Linux Security Module
(LSM) hooks. The development started using Linux kernel 2.4.17 along
with the appropriate LSM kernel patch. The implementation was based on
CIPSO and FIPS 188 standards, which specify the IP header modification.
</p><p>
One important aspect of the DSM implementation is its distributed
nature. Access control in a cluster can be performed from a subject
located on one node to a resource located on another node. Therefore,
a need exists to transfer the security information between the nodes
in the same cluster. The distributed nature of DSM provides location
transparency of the security resources in the cluster from the security
point of view.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da5c90"></a>
Network Buffer Handling</h2></div></div><p>
Here, we briefly discuss the topic of the network buffer
handling to provide a better understanding of how security information
is embedded into the network packet. We describe how the kernel handles
network buffers starting from the application layer down to the hardware
layer and vice versa.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6943f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Network Packet Flow in the Kernel
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows the flow of the network packet in the kernel. Packet
handling occurs in two cases, the incoming packet and outgoing packet.
The outgoing network packet is handled as follows, starting from the
application layer:
the application prepares the data to be sent on the network;
the application issues a system call to the kernel to send a packet;
the packet, in the form of an sk_buff structure, goes through
filters and routing functions inside the kernel; and
the packet then is passed to the network driver that sends it to
the network card (DMA).
</p><p>
The incoming network packet, starting from the
network card, begins with
the network card capturing the network packets either with its own
address or the broadcast address; it then reads them to the network
memory and generates an interrupt.
The interrupt service routine, which is triggered by the hardware
interrupt and is a part of the network card driver that runs inside the kernel,
allocates an sk_buff and moves the data from the card memory into this
buffer (DMA).
Next, the packet is put on the CPU queue for upper-layer processing, and
the processing is deferred to a later time when interrupts are
enabled.
Finally, the packets go through the filters and the routing functions
and are passed to the application layer.
</p><p>
Based on the generic information on how the network buffers are handled
in the Linux kernel, we now demonstrate how this information can be
used to extend the kernel security. We look into the hooks added to
the IP routing functions that allow us to manipulate the IP packets
and add extra security to the IP messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da6058"></a>
Adding Network Security Hooks</h2></div></div><p>
The security module can influence the routing decision based on the
security hook implementation. A few things need to be remembered
when programming the routing hooks, because those hooks are
executed as normal kernel functions for every packet coming in and
out the kernel.
</p><p>
A module that registers a function must specify the priority of
the function within the hook. The net filter hooks are called from
the kernel code in the order of priorities. The user functions are
free to manipulate the IP packet. The user function must return one
of the following values in order for the networking code to decide
what to do with the packet:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
NF_ACCEPT: do nothing and let the packet go through the network
stack.
</p></li><li><p>
NF_DROP: drop the packet. The packet is not passed for
further processing.
</p></li><li><p>
NF_STOLEN: the packet has been taken. The packet is not
passed for further processing.
</p></li><li><p>
NF_QUEUE: queue the packet for user-space handling.
</p></li><li><p>
NF_REPEAT: call this hook again.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da6580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This function shows us how the packet is manipulated before it enters the
system and before it is sent out. What we are still missing is: what
kind of information or options can we add to the packet? How? And,
will the changes coexist with the current implementation? We
answer these questions in the following sections.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da6688"></a>
IP Options</h2></div></div><p>
A little-known fact about Internet Protocol is that an IP packet can contain
a variable amount of extra information (maximum of 40 bytes) following
the standard 20-byte header. These extension bytes are called IP
options, and some of the options are defined to carry security information.
</p><p>
Currently, the Internet Protocol includes two security options. One of
them is the DoD Basic Security Option (BSO&mdash;Option Type 130), which
allows IP datagrams to be labeled with security classifications. This
option provides 16 security classifications and a variable number
of handling restrictions. To handle additional security information,
such as security categories or compartments, a second security option
(ESO&mdash;Option Type 133) exists and is referred to as the DoD Extended
Security Option (ESO).
The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for
administrating the values for the fixed fields within these two options.
</p><p>
Computer vendors now are building commercial operating systems with
mandatory access controls and multilevel security. These systems
are no longer built specifically for a particular group in the defense
or intelligence communities. They are generally available commercial
systems for use in a variety of government and civil sector environments.
</p><p>
The small number of ESO format codes cannot support all the possible
applications of a commercial security option. The BSO and ESO were
designed to support only the United States DoD. Commercial IP Security
Option (CIPSO) has been designed to support multiple security policies.
The Internet draft provides the format and procedures required to support
a mandatory access control (MAC) security policy.
</p><p>
The IP options used to label packets in our implementation are based
on the FIPS 188 standard and the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO)
draft. In our implementation, the IP header is changed using these
standards, so we can add the security information to the IP header and
send it over the network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x1da6948"></a>
IP Options in DSM</h2></div></div><p>
The security information we want to transfer using IP options are
Security ID (SID) and Security Node ID (NID). The DSM
modifies every IP packet by supplying our security information as its IP
options. Figure 2 shows the format of the modified IP header.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6943f2.large.jpg"><img src="6943f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Security Options in the IP Header
</p></div></div><p>
Here is a list of header options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
CIPSO: one octet, with a value of 134.
</p></li><li><p>
Length: one octet, the total length of the option including the type
and length fields. With the current IP header length restriction of 40
octets, the value of this field must not exceed 40.
</p></li><li><p>
Domain of Interpretation (DOI) Identifier: unsigned 32-bit integer.
The value 0 is reserved and must not appear as the DOI identifier in
any CIPSO option. Implementations should assume the DOI identifier
field is not aligned on any particular byte boundary.
</p></li><li><p>
The CIPSO Domain of Interpretation (DOI) Field, or the Security Tag Set
Name under FIPS 188: set to hexadecimal 10001000. This DOI value
was selected arbitrarily as there currently is no relevant regulatory
activity in this area.
</p></li><li><p>
Free Form: one octet, indicates that the following fields are new fields
undefined in the standard (therefore free). The value is 7.
</p></li><li><p>
Length: one octet, indicates the total length of all tags.
</p></li><li><p>
Tags (SID, NID): CIPSO uses sets of tags to contain the security
information relevant to the data in the IP packet. Each tag begins with
a tag type identifier followed by the length of the tag; it ends with
the actual security information to be passed.
</p></li><li><p>
SID tag: tag id: one octet (value 3), tag length: one octet (value 6), tag
data: 32-bit value of sid.
</p></li><li><p>
NID tag: tag id: one octet (value 6), tag length: one octet (value 6), tag
data: 32-bit value of nid.
</p></li><li><p>
The IP option we use is CIPSO. Those fields are not defined by the
standard, so they can be used in the way we define.
</p></li><li><p>
The Domain of Interpretation (DOI) and the Free Form
(FIPS 188 standard) mean that the following fields are new fields
undefined in standard, therefore they are free.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x219f698"></a>
DSM Network Hooks</h2></div></div><p>
We used the LSM security hooks in the DSM to add our security labels to
the IP messages. We now demonstrate how we achieved this by presenting an
example of an application that sends a packet over the network by writing
to a socket. The application uses some of the library calls. At one
point, a system call is generated that passes the message to the
Linux kernel. The entry point to the kernel socket implementation is
the function sys_socketcall(), located in net/socket.c.
In the chain of calls, the sock_sendmsg() function (Listing 1) in
net/socket.c is executed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x219f7a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. sock_sendmsg()</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
sock_sendmsg
(struck socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, int size)
{
  int err;
  struct scm_cookie scm;

  err =
    security_ops-&gt;socket_ops-&gt;sendmsg(sock,
                                      msg, size);
  if(err)
    return(err);
  ...

}
</pre></div><p>
One of the first actions in the function is to execute the security hook
(<tt  >security_ops-&gt;socket_ops-&gt;sendmsg(...)</tt>). This hook
ends up in the
DSM socket hook that modifies the IP packet, as shown in Listing 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x219fa60"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. dsi_socket_sendmsg()</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

int dsi_socket_sendmsg(struct socket *sock,
                       struct msghdr *msg, int size)
{
...

inode_security_t *isec;
struck sock sk;
struct ip_options *opt =  NULL;
int optlen = NSID_BASE_LEN + NSID_SSID_LEN +
             NSID_NODEID_LEN; //8 +_6 + 6
unsigned char optptr[optlen];

  ...

  sk = sock-&gt;sk;
  opt = sk-&gt;protinfo.af_inet.opt;
  dsi_options_fill (isec, optptr, optlen);
  dsi_ip_options_get(&amp;opt, optptr, optlen);
  opt = xchg(&amp;sk-&gt;protinfo.af_inet.opt, opt);

...
}

</pre></div><p>
The function dsi_options_fill sets up the security information
to the buffer as specified in the previous paragraph. Later, in
subsequent functions, this security information is attached to the
IP message as options. The SID is derived from the socket security
ID, and the NID is global for the whole node&mdash;there is no need to pass
it as a parameter to the function.
</p><p>
After this action, the modified packet with the security information
added is forwarded for normal processing in the kernel and
finally is sent over the network. At the receiving side, the incoming
messages are stored in the sk_buff structures and preprocessed
in a series of functions and hooks. One of these functions is
ip_options_compile (Listing 3) in /net/ipv4/ip_options.c, where the
options are processed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x219fd20"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. ip_options_compile ()</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

int
ip_options_compile (struct ip_options *opt,
                    struct sk_buff *skb)
{
unsigned char *pp_ptr;
unsigned char *optptr;

  ...

  case IPOPT_CIPSO:

    if(security_ops-&gt;ip_ops-&gt;decode_options(skb,
                                    optptr, &amp;pp_ptr)
      goto error;
      break;
  ...
}

</pre></div><p>
For the CIPSO case, the security hook decode_options is called. This
hook is replaced by the DSM dsi_decode_options hook, where
the security parameters (SID, NID) from the incoming packet are
read and stored in the security structure attached to this sk_buff. The
sk_buff buffers, populated with the security information, are attached
to the receiving socket queue, where they are waiting to be read by the
receiving application. In order to read them, the application issues the
system call sys_socketcall (), as it did for the sending packet. The
call once again goes through the DSM security hook, where the receiving
socket security ID is validated against the sk_buff security of the
incoming packet. If the socket is not allowed to receive the packets
with a given security ID, then those packets are dropped.
Listing 4 shows the kernel function in include/net/sock.h.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x219ff88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

int
sock_queue_rcv_skb (struct sock *sk,
                    struct sk_buff *skb)
{
int err=0;

  ...

  err=security_ops-&gt;socket_ops-&gt;sock_rcv_skb (sk,
                                              skb);

  if(err)
    return (err);
  ...
}

</pre></div><p>
As we can see, the security hook sock_rcv_skb is called. This hook
then is replaced by the DSM function dsi_sock_rcv_skb when the DSM
is loaded. In this function, the security validation is performed.
From the example code we can see work needs to be done
to manipulate the security labels.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x21a01f0"></a>
Performance Measurements</h2></div></div><p>
We performed several benchmarking tests in order to verify whether adding
options to the IP header affects the overall performance and by
how much. One test was to send a UDP packet between nodes of the cluster
and measure the performance degradation that consists of the packet
security modification on the sending side, including the packet security
extracting on the receiving side.
The average overhead of adding extra security based on our implementation
is 30%. Most of the overhead (around 25%) is related to the IP packet
modification based on the IP security option. The remaining overhead
(around 5%) is contributed by the security hooks infrastructure in
the Linux kernel, such as the socket hooks. As we can see, most of the
overhead is related to the IP packet modification based on the IP options,
with only a small fraction of the overhead caused by the security hooks
infrastructure.
</p><p>
Our future efforts will be directed at improving the IP modification algorithms
as we continue to use IP options as the security transport mechanism.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cad580.0x21a0350"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
By changing the IP options, we were able to distribute security
information to nodes of the cluster with the DSM. We have optimized
the IP packet modification and our primary results show significant
improvements&mdash;the 30% overhead has dropped to 14%.
These performance results are promising, and we see more opportunities
for further optimizations to attain a lower overhead. Nevertheless, the
results demonstrate the challenges facing the development of efficient
distributed security.
We hope you try out DSI and DSM and send us your feedback.
