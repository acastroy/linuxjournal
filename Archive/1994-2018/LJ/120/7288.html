Putting together a Linux distribution gets a lot more complicated
when stacks of requirements start arriving from hardware vendors
and other partners.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26df240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Many people have little understanding of the behind-the-scenes efforts
required to construct an enterprise Linux distribution. The fact
that this process largely can be taken for granted is actually a compliment.
This article offers a glimpse into the methodology we used to
deliver Red Hat Enterprise Linux v. 3 (Enterprise Linux v. 3). As
you will see, we faced numerous challenges along the way.
Then again, if it would have been easy, it wouldn't have been so much fun.
</p><p>
Throughout this article, the focus is on how the release was
put together. This article primarily discusses
the development of the kernel used in Enterprise Linux v. 3. The
kernel is only a fraction of an overall distribution,
the portion that controls the underlying hardware and system
resources. The challenges faced by the other teams, with projects such as compiler
tools, the installer, hundreds of application packages, documentation and
testing, are equally daunting. Each of these items was developed by gifted individuals.
</p><p>
Allow me to start by noting that we here at Red Hat have
established strong relationships with our key partners in the
industry. Although partners' anonymity is guarded here, I'm
sure they can identify where they fit in to this story
and recognize that it's all in good humor.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26df3f8"></a>
What Is an Enterprise Distribution?</h2></div></div><p>
High customer expectations have been set by the proprietary UNIX
operating systems, and customers planning to migrate from UNIX to
Linux do not want to adopt technology that cannot deliver the same
level of robustness, quality, support and compatibility.
Business users demand stability and reliability. In some cases this
means bleeding-edge technology is not appropriate for inclusion
in a product. Users also want the ability to run across a wide
range of architectures and hardware components, thereby realizing
the Linux goals of avoiding proprietary vendor lock-in. Support
needs to be in the form of ongoing maintenance for several years,
including security and bug fixes, as well as incremental hardware
support and valuable, but not destabilizing, feature enhancements.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26df500"></a>
Requirement Gathering</h2></div></div><p>
The ball gets rolling on a new release by identifying the
targeted feature set. Next to strong opinions, the second most
plentiful commodity at Red Hat is feature requests. They come
from all directions, such as insatiable independent hardware/software
vendors, demanding
customers, both large and small, and Red Hat's worldwide sales and
service support organizations. Additionally, as many ideas are
generated within Red Hat engineering, ranging from performance and
usability enhancements to marketing proposals on how to organize
the product set.
</p><p>
Obviously, we don't have infinite developer resources, so the major
challenge is to choose the best of these ideas. Another key feature
acceptance criteria is conformance with upstream Linux direction,
which is necessary for compatibility and to remain true to the
spirit of the kernel.org tree governed by Linus Torvalds and
containing contributions from around the world.
</p><p>
Here's a few examples of the challenging scenarios we face in requirements
gathering:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
We ask each of our partners to submit a reasonably sized top-ten list. One partner's requirements came in the form of a binder
that was two inches thick. This became affectionately known as
the bible. My first exposure to the bible came when it was heaved
onto my desk with a resounding thud. When I saw that, I swear
that my heart went thud, too.
</p></li><li><p>
The more mathematically inclined partners do internalize the
concept of a top-ten list. However, most ended up using a
tactic that those of you familiar with TCP/IP networking should
recognize&mdash;the sliding window protocol. The way it
works is as soon as any of your features have been accepted,
those pop off the top of the stack, freeing up space for features 11,
12 and 13 to all of a sudden become cataclysmic issues.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The following is a representative example feature list from a
hardware vendor:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Support more than 32GB of memory on x86.
</p></li><li><p>
Support more than eight CPUs.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for our new XYZ100 series computers. (This is a thinly veiled
multiple feature request; behind it is a series of required device
drivers, PCI IDs and installer hooks.)
</p></li><li><p>
Updated I/O adapter driver. (This ultimately turns into differences of
opinions regarding to which newer version this refers).
</p></li><li><p>
Integrated support for the vendor's proprietary baseboard management
software. (A perennial list item, which consistently gets rejected to
the amazement of the requester.)
</p></li><li><p>
Compiler optimizations to match the latest chipsets.
</p></li><li><p>
USB support for our CD-ROM drive. (Needed because the drive is brain-dead
and doesn't conform to the spec&mdash;of course that subtlety is absent
in the initial feature request.)
</p></li><li><p>
Support for more than 128 disks.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Then, there's typically the following implied requirements:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
All of these feature requests apply to multiple architectures, including x86,
AMD64 and Itanium 2.
</p></li><li><p>
Oh, by the way, we also want this feature backported to the
prior Enterprise Linux v. 2.1 release.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26e0108"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Countless external requests ask for either proprietary additions or
hooks. In the open-source tradition, this is something we
consistently have to refuse.
</p><p>
For Enterprise Linux v. 3, the initial set of requested features was
about 500 items. Each of these was entered into our feature-tracking tool
called Featurezilla, which actually is a derivative of
the Bugzilla bug-tracking tool. Figure 1 shows
several items in Featurezilla. To show that the jabs go both
ways, one partner has a business manager whose name is Paul, name
changed to protect the innocent. He manages a list as a text file,
but back at his company, the list is referred to as Paulzilla.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7288f1.large.jpg"><img src="7288f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The feature-tracking tool Featurezilla lists feature
requests and their status.
</p></div></div><p>
We had countless tortuous internal meetings to prioritize and slog
through the full set of 500 items. From that prioritized list, the
engineering managers went off to try to get the list down to a manageable
set that is humanly achievable by their team members. Ultimately, the
list is negotiated down to something that vastly exceeds
anything reasonably achievable by the development team. But, that's
the Red Hat way, and it's only the beginning of the story.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26e0478"></a>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v. 2.1 Maintenance Pulls</h2></div></div><p>
To keep things interesting, in addition to having to develop
to an aggressive schedule for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
v. 3 development, a large amount of effort also is required
to support the Enterprise Linux v. 2.1 maintenance stream. By the
time Enterprise Linux v. 3 shipped, v. 2.1 had been out for 15
months. Because we provide a five-year life cycle for releases in the
Enterprise Linux family, we simply cannot dump Enterprise Linux v. 2.1
support and maintenance work. The requirements demanded by our
partners in the maintenance stream form an interesting paradox. When
it comes to the objectives of the maintenance stream, it seems that
all partners and high-profile customers speak out of both sides of
their mouth.
&ldquo;Don't change anything! I'm using this release in production. Don't
upset the apple cart&rdquo;, is followed by
&ldquo;I really need this feature immediately. Hurry up and give it to me, but
don't put anything else in.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Ultimately, it all boils down to a careful case-by-case risk/benefit
assessment. Internally, we review features and bug-fix proposals
among the engineering ranks. It is well beyond my literary abilities
to convey the strong-willed and passionate debates conducted over
incorporating features or bug fixes that straddle the risk/benefit
fence.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26e06e0"></a>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux v. 3 Kernel Development</h2></div></div><p>
Some people have the mistaken impression that Red Hat simply pulls together
a random collection of bits and pieces from the upstream Open Source
community, slaps the Red Hat name on it and calls it a product. Truth be told,
Red Hat engineers contribute a substantial percentage of upstream (for
example, 2.4 and 2.6) kernel development. The productivity, breadth of knowledge
and ability to be on top of a torrent of internal and external communication
demonstrated by these kernel developers is stunning. They truly are world class
and humbling to be among. But don't tell them that, lest it goes to their
heads.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7288f2.large.jpg"><img src="7288f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Kernel developers at Red Hat, left to right: Larry
Woodman, Dave Anderson and Rik van Riel.

</p></div></div><p>
In addition to the sizable upstream enhancements that get pulled
back into the Enterprise Linux kernel, a large set of
enhancements is developed in-house to meet the product requirements. As
an open-source company, all of the kernel enhancements are available
to the community at large. The vast majority of these changes do
end up being incorporated upstream.
</p><p>
The kernel in Enterprise Linux v. 3 primarily is based on the
2.4.21 kernel, but it has a huge number of features
backported from the more recent 2.6 kernel. In recognition that the
2.6 kernel had not yet been stabilized, only key features
deemed commercially ready were candidates for the backport
into Enterprise Linux v. 3. Here's a little tip on how to
really annoy a Red Hat kernel developer: say something like, &ldquo;So,
you guys just ship the stock 2.4.21 kernel; right?&rdquo;
</p><p>
The most daunting challenges in constructing the Enterprise Linux
v. 3 kernel were the requirements that support be provided for seven
different architectures and that the kernels for these architectures
all must be built from a common source tree. The seven architectures
include: x86 (and Athlon), AMD64, Itanium 2, IBM mainframe (both s390
and s390x) and IBM's iSeries and pSeries PPC systems.
Although each of these architectures is
supported by the upstream kernels in varying degrees, the reality
is many of these architectures are developed primarily in
isolation. This inevitably leads to integration nightmares.
</p><p>
Another interesting twist to the story is Red Hat's kernel
development team literally is spread all over the world. Out
of necessity, this has led to virtually all interaction being
done on-line. For example, we rarely have team meetings, as time-zone
challenges get in the way. Sometimes this on-line communication goes
to extremes; it's quite common to use IRC chat sessions to speak
with someone sitting at the next desk. Yes, our mothers were right;
we are a bunch of geeks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26e0bb0"></a>
Late-Breaking Features</h2></div></div><p>
Just as the sun never sets on kernel development, our near-and-dear partners and customers don't sit still either. One of the
few constants in this dynamic environment is that throughout the
course of the release development, there is a steady influx
of must-have crisis feature additions.
We endeavor to make it a trade-off and kick out a lower
priority feature in order to keep the workload sane. In the
end, however, it never seems to work out to such a sweet balance. The ability
of the team to persevere through all these demands is remarkable.
</p><p>
As productive as the Red Hat developers are,
some late-breaking features always have to be deferred to a
later release or update. These situations cause no end of trauma
for our partner managers who have to be the bearers of bad news.
It's improbable that our partners ever heard the saying &ldquo;don't shoot
the messenger&rdquo;. There was one incident when we were two hours from
shipping the release and a delivery arrived on the loading dock.
It was a new computer platform we needed in order to be able
to develop and test support for it. The partner was incredulous that
we were unable to accommodate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e7580.0x26d75f8"></a>
Testing</h2></div></div><p>
Several different levels of testing are performed
throughout the development process. It all begins with the
developers performing unit testing. This consists of manual,
hands-on testing as well as development of automated testing
programs. The set of automated tests constantly is being augmented
as new problems are addressed. These automated test programs then
are incorporated into a test grid that is managed by the QA department.
In addition to the internally written unit tests, our test grid
includes a wide range of regression tests. Examples include POSIX,
LSB conformance, LTP, crashme, gcc suite and diabolical tests
provided by our partners. Stress tests also are performed for a range
of system functions using such tests as cerberus, lmbench, bonnie,
spec and other micro-benchmarks, to name a few. These automated
tests are run nightly in order to detect regressions quickly.
This is critical in order to isolate the offending code.
In contrast, if we waited to perform monthly base-level testing,
it would be much more difficult to identify the culprit.
</p><p>
On top of the nightly tests, more time-consuming
test scenarios are run less frequently. Examples include
installation testing using a wide range of configuration options
across the many different languages we support. Hands-on
testing rounds out the internal QA coverage. Doing justice to the
staggering range of testing done by the hardworking QA team here
substantially exceeds the scope of a single article.
</p><p>
After the kernels have passed internal units tests and QA scrutiny,
we make them available to our development partners. This vastly
broadens the coverage to include external QA and development teams
in other companies. Our partners focus testing on their hardware
platforms as well as the typical server capabilities their enterprise
customers demand.
</p><p>
The last layer of testing includes external beta testers. These
beta testers include high-profile customers, as well as the many
people in the Linux community who respond to our open invitation
to help with testing.
</p><p>
The combination of all these different testing activities yields an
extremely stable and well-tested product. It also points out the huge
value of the open-source model. It is the combination of testing resources
from many different companies and dedicated individuals that scales
well beyond the resources a single company could bring to bear to
tackle an infinite testing matrix.
</p><p>
Figure 3, composed by Nick Carr, summarizes the development model from
requirements gathering, development and testing, culminating in production.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In the end, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux v. 3 distribution did ship
on schedule in mid-October 2003. Having worked for many years for a major
IHV on a large-scale operating system engineering team, I have been
exposed to both the proprietary operating system development model
and the open-source development model. The successful outcome of
the Enterprise Linux v. 3 release clearly demonstrates the power
of cooperative open-source development. The quantity of features,
rapid development time and caliber of participants, both internal
and external, is remarkable and stands as a strong testament to
the Linux community.
</p><p>
When the release shipped, we all were proud to have contributed to such a
tremendous accomplishment.
But the time window to
rejoice was short indeed. As soon as Enterprise Linux v. 3 finished,
it seemed we already were late with the development of
Enterprise Linux v. 4. This reminds me of the quote, &ldquo;Congratulations
for winning this battle, that earns you the privilege to come back
and fight another day.&rdquo; Gotta go, more battles to fight.
