If a co-op business structure works for Sunkist and
Land O'Lakes, it could work for software too. After several
successful university software development projects, developers
in Brazil are using an old business plan in a new way.

Univates, a university center in the south of Brazil, has been a
free software user since 1997 and has adopted free software as
a standard for administrative
people since 1999. As there was no academic administration
system available as free software, Univates developed its own,
SAGU. SAGU now is used by a dozen other universities in Brazil,
with some of them contributing code. By adopting free
software and developing SAGU, Univates has saved almost
$200,000 US in software licenses. It further saves $70,000 US every
year as it doesn't need to buy new licenses or upgrades when
installing new computers or increasing the user base. The
number of students in Univates has grown from a little less
than 2,000 in 1999 to more than 7,500 in 2003. The savings
always have been more than enough to cover the payroll of the
whole IT department, now employing 26 people.
</p><p>
If you search Google with the keywords Free Software
Brazil, you surely will find Univates' projects among the first
search results. These projects include a library automation
and integrated circulation system, GNUTECA, which is compliant
with international library standards. It has been promoted in
South America through workshops held by Unesco's office
in Montevideo. There also is a PHP-based, object-oriented
development framework, MIOLO, that was used to develop GNUTECA
and is the base of several other projects. You also should
look at Agata Report, a full-featured professional database
reporting tool; see <a href="http://www.univates.br/freesoftware" target="_self">www.univates.br/freesoftware</a>.

Regional Development</h2></div></div><p>
Univates is a
community-owned university.
Its only financial support comes from students' payments and some services it provides to the
region's industries. It serves a region made up of 40 cities
where 300,000 people live. As it is owned by the community,
Univates also is audited by this community, which participates
in the election of the rector and in several committees
that help decide the university's actions. Univates
is committed to regional development and has
promoted several programs through which it helps local
industry.
</p><p>
Univates has watched its IT department become self-sustainable and even
generate resources for the university by
selling services such as software customization and technology
transfer seminars. However, as Univates never wanted to
be a software house, it proposed to its IT team that it become a
separate entity. As its own entity, it can be hired by Univates and by others,
expanding its business and creating job positions to be
filled by the university's graduates and students. Both this
new entity and Univates would work on a business plan that would
link regional development and free software.
</p><p>
The International Co-operative Association (<a href="http://www.ica.coop" target="_self">www.ica.coop</a>)
says that:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Co-ops are based on helping each other and caring for
others. A cooperative is a type of business or organization. It
is a group of people who are working together to solve their
own problems and meet their needs. Co-ops are different
from other types of organizations since they abide by three
main rules: 1) co-ops treat people fairly and
respectfully; 2) co-ops encourage people to work together toward
solving their mutual problems; and 3) co-ops provide products and services to meet
people's needs rather than solely for the purpose of making
money.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
By this definition, it is quite easy to see that a
co-operative organization and the free software philosophy have
a lot in common. Both are concerned with treating people with respect
and working toward common objectives. The new organization that
was born from Univates' IT department is a cooperative called
SOLIS (<a href="http://www.solis.coop.br" target="_self">www.solis.coop.br</a>), officially inaugurated on May 12,
2003.
</p><p>
SOLIS works toward regional development
by finding ways of empowering local businesses through the
use of free software. By doing this, people at SOLIS hope
these businesses can become more competitive, profitable
and able to grow and hire more people.
</p><p>
Right now SOLIS is working with industrial and commercial
associations, helping the companies associated with them
fine-tune their needs in order to save money by sharing among
them the costs of software development, customization and
training.
Univates and SOLIS wish to prove in a practical way
that free software can help regional development and is good
business that&mdash;most importantly&mdash;respects
people's free access to knowledge. We hope other universities
can set up similar arrangements in their own regions.

Cesar Brod (<a href="mailto:cesar@brod.com.br">cesar@brod.com.br</a>) first became involved with
the GNU/Linux operating system in 1993. He now is the IT manager and
coordinates software development for Univates. Cesar also is the
Vice President of SOLIS and the coordinator of the international
section of the Latin America Free Software Conference (<a href="http://www.softwarelivre.pti.org.br" target="_self">www.softwarelivre.pti.org.br</a>), which will be in November
2004, in the beautiful setting of the Iguassa Falls, among Paraguay,
Argentina and Brazil.
