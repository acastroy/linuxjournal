The attack path between intruders and your data might be shorter than you

As I write this, yet another e-mail worm is spreading
among non-Linux computers and incidentally filling
my mailbox with &ldquo;YOU HAVE A VIRUS&rdquo; bounces from dumb
software that somehow doesn't yet get the concept that
worms forge mail. There's nothing like a worm attack
that spares Linux to bring out the smug superiority
in Linux users.
</p><p>
Cut it out. The attack path here is one step long.
All that's keeping us safe is that most programs
for Linux don't make it easy to run attachments from
incoming mail. But combine the right vulnerability in
a common desktop app with a little social engineering,
and you've got a Linux worm.
</p><p>
Last year, the not-so-dramatically-named CAN-2003-0434
vulnerability allowed humble PDF files to run
arbitrary commands as you. Linux users and
distributions dealt with it quickly enough that
it didn't turn into a vector for spreading a worm.
With today's larger Linux user base and more desktop
standardization, the next vulnerability will be a
bigger risk.
</p><p>
Now that we've scared you, we'll cover the tools
you could use to prevent not just a mail worm, but
other attacks we don't know about yet. Run a local
firewall and don't let programs on your company's
desktops reach outside SMTP servers. Deploy exactly
the firewall policy you want, on every host, with
the advanced iptables advice in Chris Lowth's Kernel
Korner on page 24.
As you move your business apps to PHP, design them
for security with Xavier Spriet's battle-tested
designs on page 54.
</p><p>
And, make the next move in the spam wars. Deal with
forgery where it starts. Although the US has
essentially legalized spam, all the ISP advertising
we've seen recently has used spam filtering as a
selling point. Sender Permitted From, which Meng
Weng Wong covers on page 62, lets you pop up out
of the weeds and get mail through to customers who
use strict spam filtering. SPF is a &ldquo;look at me,
I'm legit&rdquo; measure you can deploy in a few
minutes for a simple mail configuration.
</p><p>
Finally, in our cover story, Ibrahim Haddad and
Miroslaw Zakrzewski explain a promising example of
how to apply the kernel's Linux Security
Module (LSM) interface to add process-level access
control for telecom apps running on clusters (page 68).
Developers can carry out this level of work, free
of restrictions, because of the freedom that the
GPL licensing consensus gives all of us. Keep your
systems secure and enjoy this month's issue.
